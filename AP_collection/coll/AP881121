<HEAD>Psychiatrist Report on Nussbaum Details Lisa's Last Night</HEAD>

   The night before Joel Steinberg's adoptive
6-year-old daughter was removed unconscious from their apartment,
his live-in companion said she heard noises in a bedroom ``like Joel
throwing Lisa,'' sources said Monday.
   Hedda Nussbaum told a psychiatrist at Columbia Presbyterian
Medical Center on Nov. 20 that Steinberg, who is accused of beating
Lisa Steinberg to death, then handed the child to her, saying,
``This is your child; what have you done; this has gone far
enough,'' WCBS-TV said Monday, quoting from a copy of the
unidentified psychiatrist's report.
   The Associated Press confirmed the contents of the report through
sources close to the case.
   Nussbaum told the psychiatrist that Steinberg was angry that
night because Lisa refused to drink water after he had given her and
Nussbaum hot pepper. She said he gave them the hot pepper to get
them to drink more water.
   She later heard noises from the bedroom that sounded ``like Joel
throwing Lisa,'' the report said.
   Afterward, Steinberg gave the child to Nussbaum, who placed her
on the floor and noticed water and food coming out of her mouth.
   The report said that Nussbaum thought Joel may have poured water
down Lisa's mouth and that she was drowning. Nussbaum said she then
began pumping the child's chest.
   Nussbaum told the psychiatrist that Steinberg had left the
apartment shortly afterward and returned about 10 p.m. At about 6
a.m. Steinberg said, ``She's stopped breathing'' and told Nussbaum
to ``call 911.''
   Nussbaum, 46, a former editor of children's books, also was
charged with Lisa's murder, but the charges against her later were
dropped.
   She has spent the last year undergoing physical and psychiatric
rehabilitation for injuries the prosecution says she suffered at
Steinberg's hands.
   At Steinberg's trial on Monday a photographer testified that he
used poses and lighting tricks to hide bruises he saw on the
battered child when he took pictures of her in school two weeks
before she was found dead.
   Stuart Gross, working that day for Scholastic Books, said he
initially was reluctant to photograph the first-grader when he
visited her school on Oct. 22, 1987, because of her numerous bruises
and her unkempt appearance.
   ``I observed some bruises underneath her left eye, by the cheeks,
a bump on the forehead and underneath the chin here, a bruise, and
some bruises on her arms,'' Gross said. ``The hair was very unkempt
... uneven,'' and her clothes were ``very rumpled, dirty,'' he said.
   Gross said he eventually took several black and white pictures of
Lisa. He said he was drawn to her when she began directing two other
children on posing the way he wanted them. ``She seemed older, more
mature,'' he said.
   ``I put her on the right side and I flooded my light into her and
I had her turn her head this way and down so you wouldn't see it.
The last thing my client wants to see is bruises,'' Gross said.
   He said the rumpled and dirty quality of Lisa's clothing also was
eliminated ``in the way I photographed them.''
   Steinberg, 47, is charged with murder for allegedly beating Lisa
to death. The disbarred lawyer denies that he hit the child. He says
she fell unconscious after choking on food she had vomited.
   Lisa was taken unconscious from Steinberg's Greenwich Village
apartment early on Nov. 2, 1987, and died three days later at a
hospital.
   Prosecutors are trying to show by Gross' photographs and
testimony that Lisa was an abused child in the weeks before her
death. They hope to eliminate any reasonable inference except that
the abuse was inflicted by Steinberg, who illegally adopted the girl.

<HEAD>South Korea's Roh Indicates He May Pardon Chun, Who Prepares
Apology</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo was quoted as
saying Monday that he wants to resolve politically the controversy
raging over his predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, an indication he may
pardon Chun.
   Chun is preparing to apologize for corruption and other misdeeds
before moving into rural exile.
   Roh said his government hopes to resolve the controversy over
Chun by the end of this year. The former president is being forced
out of the capital, Seoul, by militant students who rioted and tried
to break into his home, demanding that he be arrested and punished
for alleged corruption and other abuses during seven years of
authoritarian rule.
   Roh was quoted as saying in an interview with the national daily
Shinmun, a pro-government newspaper published in Seoul:
   ``In handling past wrongdoings, a clear distinction must be made
between those (wrongdoings) to be dealt with judicially and those to
be dealt with politically ... Any wrongdoings by Chun as chief
executive of the country should be dealt with politically and there
should not be political reprisal against the former chief executive
...
   ``I will take actions under the principle that any wrongdoings by
a chief executive should be dealt with politically and that any
political reprisal would only hurt democratic development.''
   He made the remarks as the 56-year-old Chun reportedly was
preparing to make a nationally televised apology Wednesday.
   Newspapers said Chun also is to turn over most of his wealth to
the government and accept rural exile, a traditional way of
repentance for a disgraced Korean.
   Chun originally planned to leave Seoul on Tuesday, but was
delayed because of difficulty finding him a safe rural home, news
reports said.
   The former president, who stepped down in February, denies
personal wrongdoing. However, about a dozen of his relatives and
associates were convicted or charged with corruption involving
millions of dollars in public funds.
   Chun needs a refuge from attack. Some reports said he would go to
a mountainside Buddhist temple near an army unit in the north.
Others said he might move to central South Korea. He reportedly is
unwelcome in his southern hometown.
   National Assembly hearings Monday on abuses under the Chun
government focused on attempts to stifle press freedom. More than
700 journalists were fired under government pressure and many
newspapers and broadcast operations were merged and placed under
state control by Chun's administration.
   In recent weeks, Chun has been a virtual prisoner in his
luxurious Seoul home, guarded by hundreds of riot police to prevent
attacks by dissidents.
   Roh's government has been accused of trying to protect Chun and
is trying to defuse public anger without being implicated in the
furor.
   Chun, a former army general, took power with military backing in
1980. He was succeeded by Roh, another former general and close
associate, after presidential elections last December.

   Ten-year-old Marc Coleman doesn't care
that experts are having trouble explaining how his helium-filled
balloon flew 2,500 miles from Michigan to San Diego.
   He just thinks it's neat, said his mother, Liz.
   Marc's 11-inch, yellow balloon was one of 250 launched Oct. 23 to
commemorate a local church's anniversary. Each balloon was tied with
a string that carried a card asking the finder to return it to the
church.
   The church received 10 to 15 responses, mostly from within 20
miles.
   Marc's balloon wound up deflated in the swimming pool of a San
Diego sheriff's deputy Oct. 30.
   ``I can't explain how it got there,'' Deputy Kenneth Smith wrote
to Marc. ``At that distance, I can't believe it was the wind itself.
It had to have some help somewhere along the line.''
   The National Weather Service can't explain the trip, either.
   ``That would be some trick,'' said the weather service's Mike
Kalembkiewicz. If the balloon were only windblown, it would be ``a
once in a lifetime happening.''

   Deciding that it's never too late to
change, the mayor wants to give women here the right to vote.
   Actually, women in this east Tennessee town of 2,800 have been
voting since 1920, when the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
was ratified.
   But the town's 1902 charter still forbids it, and Mayor Roy Leach
says it's time to have it changed.
   ``I'd like to see them try to stop the women in Jellico from
voting,'' said Betty Douglas, wife of City Councilman Marvin
Douglas. ``They would have a riot on their hands.''

   There is such a thing as a free lunch _ just
ask about 1,000 people who patronized a downtown restaurant.
   Jamie Petrolias, owner of Jamie's on the Square, gave away free
chicken and cole slaw lunches Monday to promote his 2-week-old
eatery.
   ``We're just thrilled with the people who came out,'' Petrolias
said.
   The 25-year-old restaurateur, whose family has owned another
downtown restaurant for 55 years, said the crowd consumed 1,500
pounds of chicken, 150 pounds of cabbage and 15 gallons of salad oil.
   He estimated the giveaway cost him about $1,500, but added, ``I
really haven't figured it out myself. I'm afraid to.''
   Petrolias said he was pleased with the crowd, which was orderly
and friendly.
   ``We were just delighted,'' he said ``Our kitchen isn't gigantic,
and it was tough to keep up, but we managed.''

   Charlie Gettel has designed papier-mache heads of
the famous for Detroit's Thanksgiving Day parade for 45 years, but
to his surprise, parade organizers have had him immortalized.
   Organizers last week unveiled a 15-pound, baldheaded bust of
Gettel.
   ``They kept it a secret from me for eight months,'' said Gettel,
who has designed likenesses ranging from Henry Ford to Mickey Mouse
as decorations for parade floats. ``It was packed in the same huge
crate as (civil rights pioneer) Rosa Parks' head.
   ``When I pulled it out, I almost flipped. I was so flabbergasted
I got all red in the face. Now I'm immortalized. Even when I die
I'll be part of the parade.''
   This year, nine new heads will make their parade debut, including
likenesses of aviator Charles Lindbergh and rock singer Bob Seger,
Gettel said.
   The heads have become a major attraction at the Thanksgiving
procession, where children and adults make a game out of guessing
the identities of the lesser-known noggins.
   ``I just love it so much I can hardly call it a job,'' Gettel
said. ``To me, Thanksgiving lasts all year.''

   The country's population grew by

increase since 1950, the Bureau of Statistics said.
   The year that ended June 30 was also just the third since 1950 in
which net migration exceeded natural increase _ the excess of births
over deaths _ in total population growth, the bureau said Monday.
   The Bureau of Statistics said net migration _ permanent arrivals
minus departures _ totalled 143,200, also the largest increase since
1949-1950.
   It said Britain and New Zealand were the largest source of
migrants, followed by the Philippines, Malayasia, Vietnam and Hong
Kong.
   Aborigines, the country's indigenous inhabitants, number some
160,000, or about 1 percent of Australia's population.

   North Korean clams have been imported
to South Korea, the first product to arrive since the Seoul
government approved a policy allowing direct trade with North Korea.
   A customs spokesman said today that 40 pounds of short-necked
clams from North Korea had cleared customs at the port city of
Pusan. Half the shipment was frozen and half were dried, the
spokesman said.
   The clams were brought to South Korea by way of Japan by Hyundai
Corp., a general trading company, as food samples in preparation for
expansion of trading with the north.
   The Seoul government approved the resumption of direct trade of
all but military goods in October as a gesture of goodwill in
efforts to ease tension and improve relations between the two Koreas.
   Goods from the communist north had been banned since the division
of the peninsula after World War II.

<DATELINE>FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They call it ``The Castle,'' a
massive stone building with eight wings radiating from a central
six-story rotunda.
   The wings hold eight tiers of cells, stacked one upon the other,
and in each 8-by-10-foot cell an inmate is allowed a cot, a table
and a chair.
   The U.S. Disciplinary Barracks in Fort Leavenworth is the biggest
military prison in the nation. It is a grim home for about 1,450
inmates, sent here from bases all over the world, wherever American
military men and women are stationed.
   Forty-two officers, including one lieutenant colonel, and 21
women are serving time here. Among them are drug dealers, armed
robbers, rapists, murderers and spies. More than 80 are serving life
terms. Three inmates are on death row.
   And there is strict military discipline.
   ``Our rules are so strict that if a guy turns left and he knows
he's not supposed to turn left, he's in trouble,'' said Lt. Col.
Gerald M. Gasko, prison chief of staff.
   ``You earn what you get here,'' added the prison commandant, Col.
Larry Berrong, a former Army airborne Ranger and Vietnam veteran.
``There aren't any free lunches.''
   Military officials say the goal of the prison is not just
confinement, but correction.
   ``Unfortunately, in the United States today we do a lot of
confining and not much correction,'' Gasko said. ``We attempt to
give them tools so when they leave here, they can be productive
citizens.''
   When inmates leave these walls, they return to civilian life, not
to the military.
   Next to discipline, training is the top priority at the Fort
Leavenworth prison, which has more than 20 vocational programs
including automotive repairs, printing, carpentry, upholstery, and
hotel and restaurant management.
   Inmates, whom officials would not allow to be interviewed, even
repair cars and furniture of military families living at Fort
Leavenworth.
   Officials claim the Disciplinary Barracks has the oldest shoe
repair business west of the Mississippi River, started in 1877 to
make boots for cavalrymen.
   Now it repairs everything from prescription orthopedic shoes to
cleated golf shoes, Gasko said.
   The prison also has one of the largest silk-screening businesses
in the nation, providing all the decals for U.S. Air Force planes.
   Congress authorized the prison's construction in 1874. An old
quartermaster depot that had supplied military posts in the Indian
Territory housed the first prisoners. The Castle was completed in
1915 by inmate labor.
   Inmate labor is still used for maintenance, but the prisoners
also work with their minds. Most have high school diplomas, and
those who don't go straight into the classroom when they arrive,
Gasko said.
   They can earn associate and bachelor's degrees through
correspondence, and a few are working on master's degrees, but Gasko
said they do that at their own expense.
   The prison takes enlisted men from all branches of the service
except the U.S. Navy. It takes all convicted officers, regardless of
the length of the sentence.
   Gasko said the shortest sentence for an officer he recalls is
seven days. ``I think they wanted him to see the inside of a
prison,'' he said.
   One inmate is going into his 17th year, he added.
   Some famous inmates have seen the inside of its walls, from Lt.
William Calley, who was convicted of murdering Vietnamese civilians
at My Lai, to Clayton Lonetree, the U.S. Marine who was convicted of
espionage while an embassy guard in Moscow.
   Three inmates are awaiting death sentence, although the Army has
not executed anyone since 1961 and no execution dates have been set.
They are:
   _ Ronald Gray, 22, of Liberty City, Fla., who was sentenced last
April in connection with the death of two women. He was stationed at
Fort Bragg, N.C.
   _ James Murphy, 24, of Clinton, N.C., who was convicted last year
of murdering his wife, his 6-year-old stepson, and his 2-year-old
son, while stationed in Nanau, Germany, with the Army.
   _ Ronnie Curtis, 22, a Marine from Wichita, Kan., who was
convicted in August 1987 of murdering his platoon commander and
platoon commander's wife at Camp Lejeune.
   Although most inmates are first-time offenders, the average
sentence is about 10 years. About two-thirds are serving time for
such crimes as assault, rape, murder or kidnapping; 17 percent are
imprisoned for narcotics violations, and 11 percent were sentenced
for theft. No inmate is serving time for just a military offense,
such as being absent without leave.
   Some prisoners work outside the walls and in nearby Leavenworth
on work-release programs. About 20 inmates work on the 2,600-acre
prison farm, which raises hogs and cattle and grows row crops and
vegetables.
   Outside The Castle walls, inmates who are ``installation
parolees'' stay in an unsecure barracks. They have proved
themeselves reliable while doing their time, and have earned a few
extra privleges.
   ``The only thing that keeps them out there is moral restraint,''
Gasko said. ``But the rules are extremely tough, and we don't
tolerate any violations.''

   ``Moonwalker,'' a 94-minute video celebration
of the weird and wonderful world of Michael Jackson, is being
released early next year.
   The video will be an amalgam of Jackson's musical performances,
his reflections on media pressures and a narrative film in which he
transforms himself into a robot and then a spaceship to battle a
drug pusher named Mr. Big, said CBS Music Video Enterprises.
   The release of the video on Jan. 10 comes at the end of Jackson's
15-month world tour, which was seen by 4 million fans in 15
countries.
   Songs on the video include Jackson's ``Man in the Mirror,'' his
redo of the Beatles' hit ``Come Together,'' and ``The Moon is
Walking,'' a song written and performed by the South African vocal
group Ladysmith Black Mombazo.
   The suggested price of the video is $24.98.

<DATELINE>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evening campfires in the nomads'
camelhide tents dance to a nightly staccato of gunfire from warring
rebels and communist government soldiers on the desert plain outside
this ancient provincial capital.
   Turbaned men oblivious to the shots face southwest toward the
Moslem holy city of Mecca to begin their evening prayer. Women in
voluminous layers of colored cloth move about nearby.
   The primitive nomad tribes have for centuries encamped near
Kandahar's satellite village of Argandab. Now, Soviet jets scream
overhead.
   Afghanistan's war goes on around them and sometimes engulfs them.
   Less than a mile from the nomads' camp, Moslem rebels, blast away
at government military posts with recoilless rifles,
rocket-propelled grenade launchers and light and heavy machine guns.
   The army's artillery is an even match, but government troops have
an advantage in air power from the Soviet Union. Newly introduced
MiG-27 ground-attack fighters and Backfire bombers have blasted
civilian and guerrilla targets since the beginning of November.
   The question is how long can the government hold Kandahar, a key
city, once the Soviets withdraw from Afghanistan. They are committed
to do so by February.
   In Argandab, where civilians far outnumber rebels, jets swept one
recent day over the main bazaar, levelling a portion of it, killing
nine people and wounding 80 others.
   A squat man with a gray beard said, ``When I wake up in the
morning until I go to sleep, I'm not sure about my life, that I will
be alive five minutes from now because of the war.''
   The old man, wrapped in a blanket, said he lived in Kandahar,
once the capital of all Afghanistan.
   Through the fine dust that hangs over the city, the pale blue
dome of the Kalqi Sharif mosque can be seen from a distance. The
mosque, which embodies the Islamic tenets propelling the rebel
mujahedeen in their fight sits opposite the governor's home, a
stronghold of the Soviet-backed government.
   The western entrance to the city is deserted but for the army and
militia, tanks and trucks. Civilians are not seen except at the
bazaar at Shaheedan Chowk, a pillared monument honoring Afghans
killed fighting the British more than a century ago.
   Kandahar, known as the city of kings, is the birthplace of
generations of Afghan royalty. The ornate tomb of Ahmad Shah
Durrani, the grandfather of Afghanistan's exiled King Zahir Shah, is
a vernerated site of monarchists who are in the majority around
Kandahar, both among the mujahedeen and civilians.
   The rubble of blasted buildings chokes the streets, forcing
motorized rickshaws and horse drawn ``tonga'' carriages to steer an
obstacle course through the bazaar.
   Gul Lalai, a commander of the rebel National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan, said the bulk of the damage near Herat Gate on the
western edge of Kandahar occurred when fighter jets aiming at
guerrilla positions in a nearby suburb missed their mark.
   Evidence that the guerrillas have operated extensively in the
city for years is the heavy tank-fire damage to the mud homes and
shops.
   About 50,000 people remain in Kandahar compared to a prewar
population of about 200,000, making it second only in size to Kabul,
Afghanistan's capital.
   Old men, women and children crowd daily into the bazaar before it
closes at 2 p.m.
   The free access of women and children is used by mujahedeen who
employ youngsters to bring supplies to rebel bases from the city.
   One of the young recruits, Gul Mohammad, said he lost his mother,
two younger sisters and a brother when a tank round hit his home in
Kandahar two years ago. He was 9 years old at the time.
   Police once stopped him and a friend carrying turbans, sandals
and ``important letters'' to rebels, he said. ``When they captured
me they beat me up. Even they broke my head.''
   Mohammad said he spent almost a year in Kandahar prison.
   ``Everyday for questioning they brought us to a room full of
water and made us lie down and they beat us,'' he said.
   ``I'm not afraid of anything,'' he boasted. But mujahedeen said
his forays into the city were finished.

   Rep. Robert Garcia, indicted in New York on
conspiracy charges in the Wedtech corruption scandal, is the 18th
person in the last decade to be indicted on criminal charges while
serving in Congress.
   He is also the second Democratic congressman from New York to be
indicted for allegedly using his influence on behalf of the Wedtech
Corp., a minority-owned New York City machine shop that won no-bid
U.S. Army contracts. It has since gone bankrupt.
   Mario Biaggi, whose former congressional district in New York's
Bronx Borough abuts Garcia's, was convicted Aug. 5 of racketeering,
mail fraud and accepting bribes from Wedtech in exchange for his
Washington influence.
   Biaggi, 71, resigned his House seat Aug. 6 after serving nearly
10 terms. He was sentenced Friday to eight years in prison and a
$242,000 fine.
   Biaggi also was convicted in November 1987 of accepting an
illegal gratuity _ a paid vacation _ for helping an ailing shipyard
in New York's Brooklyn Borough. He was sentenced to 2{ years in
prison and a $500,000 fine in that case. Biaggi is slated to report
to prison authorities on Jan. 9.
   Last month, former two-term Rep. Pat Swindall, R-Ga., was
indicted on perjury charges. Swindall, who narrowly lost his seat
Nov. 8 as a result of the charges, allegedly lied to a grand jury
investigating a proposed $850,000 home mortgage loan he discussed
with an Atlanta businessman and an undercover agent posing as a
financier. Swindall allegedly denied being told the source of the
loan could be illicit drug money.
   Swindall's trial began last month but was postponed after a juror
received a mailing from his campaign.
   Also last month, Fofo I.F. Sunia, American Samoa's former
delegate to Congress, was sentenced to five to 15 months in prison
for participating in a payroll-padding scheme that reportedly earned
him $39,000. Sunia, a Democrat who had served almost four terms,
pleaded guilty to conspiring with his chief aide to defraud the
government of $130,920 through false payroll claims.
   The 51-year-old Sunia resigned his congressional seat Sept. 6. As
a delegate, he was allowed to vote in legislative committees but not
on the House floor.
   Other members of Congress indicted since 1978:
   _Rep. Harold E. Ford, D-Tenn., charged in April 1987 with bank,
mail and tax fraud. No trial date has been set.
   _Rep. Bobbi Fiedler, R-Calif., indicted Jan. 23, 1986, along with
an aide on charges she tried to buy off an opponent for the GOP
Senate nomination in California. The charges subsequently were
dismissed by a Superior Court judge in Los Angeles; Fiedler lost the
primary.
   _Rep. George Hansen, R-Idaho, indicted in April 1983 and
convicted one year later on charges of violating the 1978 Ethics in
Government Act by failing to report $333,978 in loans and other
transactions on his financial disclosure forms. Hansen was freed in
October 1987 after serving nearly one year of a five-to-15-month
sentence.
   _Sen. Harrison A. Williams Jr., D-N.J., convicted in May 1981 on
charges stemming from the FBI's Abscam investigation, including
conspiracy, bribery, conflict of interest, receiving an unlawful
gratuity and interstate travel in aid of a racketeering enterprise.
   Williams resigned from the Senate in March 1982. He was paroled
from a halfway house in January 1986 after serving nearly two years
of a three-year sentence at the federal penitentiary at Allenwood,
Pa.
   Six House members also were indicted as a result of the
undercover Abscam investigation, and all served prison terms. They
were:
   Rep. Raymond Lederer, D-Pa., convicted in January 1981 of
conspiracy, bribery, receiving an unlawful gratuity and interstate
travel to further racketeering; Rep. Michael ``Ozzie'' Myers, D-Pa.,
convicted in August 1980 of conspiracy, bribery and interstate
travel; Rep. John Jenrette, D-S.C., convicted in October 1980 of
sharing a $50,000 bribe.
   Also, Rep. John Murphy, D-N.Y., convicted in December 1980 of
conspiracy, conflict of interest and receiving an unlawful gratuity;
Rep. Frank Thompson, D-N.J., convicted in December 1980 of bribery,
conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the acceptance of a criminal
gratuity; Rep. Richard Kelly, R-Fla., convicted in January 1981 of
taking a $25,000 bribe from an undercover FBI agent and of taking
part in a $250,000 bribery conspiracy.
   _Rep. Claude ``Buddy'' Leach, D-La., was indicted in July 1979 on
charges of buying votes in the 1978 election and violating federal
campaign finance laws. He was acquitted of some vote-buying counts
and the others were dropped, and a federal appeals court dismissed
the charges of campaign finance law violations.
   _Rep. Joshua Eilberg, D-Pa., indicted in October 1978 on federal
charges of illegally receiving compensation to help a Philadelphia
hospital get a $14.5 million federal grant. He pleaded guilty in
February 1979 and was sentenced to five years' probation and fined
$10,000.
   _Rep. Daniel J. Flood, D-Pa., indicted in the fall of 1978 on 13
counts of bribery, conspiracy and perjury. His trial on 11 counts
ended in a mistrial in February 1979, and he resiged from the House
in January 1980, citing health reasons, after the House ethics
committee accused him of 25 rules violations. In February 1980, he
pleaded guilty to conspiracy in a plea-bargaining arrangement and
was given a year's probation.
   _Rep. Charles C. Diggs Jr., D-Mich., indicted in March 1978 and
convicted in October 1978 on 29 felony counts of illegally diverting
his congressional employees' salaries to his personal use. Censured
by the House in 1979, Diggs resigned from Congress in 1980 and
served seven months of a three-year prison sentence.

   Young CBS correspondent Dan Rather was standing
just over a ridge from Dallas' Dealey Plaza, holding a yellow sack,
waiting for a film drop from the cameraman in President Kennedy's
motorcade.
   ``I saw what I thought was the president's limousine, and it
seemed to make a wrong turn,'' Rather recalled recently. ``It all
went by in a blur.
   ``I knew something was wrong. You know when you know something,
but you don't know why you know it? I went back over that ridge and
saw an incredible scene. Some people were on the ground, some people
were trying to cover children. It was a scene of great confusion.''
   Rather looked for a telephone but couldn't immediately find one.
He sprinted to KRLD, the CBS affiliate, a few blocks away.
   CBS anchor Walter Cronkite was in New York, working in the
newsroom.
   ``I happened to be standing at the printer when the UP bulletin
came across that shots had rung out in Dealey Plaza,'' he said. ``As
soon as we got that first report, we ordered up lines and got into
the announce booth ... and started interrupting with voiceover
bulletins on the ongoing program. And then we got the camera up
there I think in about 10 minutes.''
   While Cronkite read wire reports on the air, Rather was at KRLD
trying to confirm rumors that Kennedy was dead. The Parkland
Memorial Hospital switchboard told him Kennedy was dead. KRLD's
Eddie Barker had the head of the hospital saying he was dead. Rather
finally got a surgeon and a priest who were in the emergency room to
confirm that Kennedy was dead. Rather told New York. Cronkite went
with it on the air.
   ``There wasn't any doubt in my mind,'' said Rather, who had
beaten the opposition on the biggest story of their lives. ``The
official announcement wasn't made for another 17 minutes. It was a
very long 17 minutes.''
   After those 17 minutes, Cronkite was handed a piece of wire copy.
``From Dallas, Texas, the flash, apparently official,'' he said
solemnly, removing his glasses. ``President Kennedy died at 1 p.m.
Central Standard Time. Two o'clock Eastern Standard Time. Some 38
minutes ago.'' Cronkite choked up for a moment, on camera.
   ``This one really struck home,'' he recalled. ``This was tearing
the guts out.
   ``It was when you finally had to say the word, officially, that
he was dead that it really impacted in the way it did.''
   Cronkite walked off the air after six hours and just wanted to
call his wife, Betsy. The phone lines had been tied up all
afternoon. A line came free for a second, and he grabbed it, only to
hear a woman ask to speak to ``someone in charge of the news
department.''
   ``She said, `I'd like to complain about having that Walter
Cronkite on the air at this time crying his crocodile tears when
everyone knows he hated John Kennedy.' I said, `Madam, what is your
name?' She gave me her name and address on Park Avenue. I said, `You
are speaking to Walter Cronkite, and you, madam, are a goddamn
idiot.''' He hung up.
   On Sunday, the networks were covering the movement of accused
assassin Lee Harvey Oswald from the Dallas City Jail to the county
jail. Only NBC was on live when Jack Ruby stepped out of the crowd
and shot Oswald at point-blank range. Tom Pettit was the
correspondent on the scene.
   ``I clearly saw the shooting which was about six feet from where
I was,'' he says. ``I had a clear visual field to see somebody fire
a revolver into Oswald's lower abdomen. I did not see Jack Ruby come
through the crowd. I did not see anybody; I just saw the gunshot.
   ``What I was seeing was coming out of my mouth. It was the only
time I've really experienced doing eyewitness reporting while you're
live on the air.''
   Pettit said he has never seen his own coverage of the Oswald
assassination and doesn't want to.
   ``You know, it's a kind of a historic event in broadcasting, the
first televised murder, but for me it was so horrendous a situation
to be in and so emotional and so charged with fear, concern and a
sense of pending doom that I would not like to relive it.
   ``I remember hearing our coverage when they had the casket at the
rotunda of the Capitol. No narration, just symphonic music.
Television really distinguished itself in that time, I think, really
devoted itself to the notion that it was holding the country
together. Whether it was in truth or not, who am I to say? But at
the time, we certainly felt that responsibility.''
   ``It was a major moment of course in our history and in our
television history,'' Cronkite said. ``I think we responded as an
industry well. We showed our capabilities technologically and
substantively as well _ what we covered, how we covered it, the
decorum with which we approached the story.''
   ``I think these four days were the beginning of the television
age, certainly the beginning for television journalism,'' Rather
said. ``There was a second-class citizenry to being a television
journalist. That day, not only did we take you there, television
journalists did some real good reporting. ... That day, we began to
feel, hey, we're as good as anybody.''

   Vietnamese authorities have bowed to
international appeals and commuted the death sentences of two
Buddhist monks convicted of subversive activities, an Australian
government spokesman said today.
   Authorities in Vietnam told Australia's ambassador in Hanoi on
Friday that the sentences of philosopher and teacher Thich Tue Si
and scholar Thich Tri Sieu were commuted to 20 years in prison, the
Foreign Ministry official said.
   The two monks were condemned to death in October by the Ho Chi
Minh City Court on charges they participated in subversive
activities, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The two monks were arrested in 1984 with 19 Buddhist scholars.
The scholars received undisclosed terms of imprisonment. There were
no details on what kind of subversive activities they were alleged
to have undertaken.
   The status of a third person also facing capital punishment in
Vietnam, Tran Van Luong, was not known, the spokesman said.
   He said Australia and other countries began making pleas to
Vietnam after the death sentences were imposed. Australia opposes
capital punishment.

   A year after Cubans from the Mariel boatlift
rioted at two prisons for a chance at freedom, thousands are out on
parole, but more are dribbling back into what could be lifetime
custody.
   Many of the thousands of Cubans held by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service will be freed more quickly because of changes
made in the review process as a result of the agreement that ended
the riots, but others will have to await new laws or the whim of the
Cuban government.
   Critics of the process acknowledge it has increased the number of
Cubans freed but say it has other problems.
   ``We're not saying some of (the Cuban prisoners) in there aren't
bad,'' said Gary Leshaw, a Legal Aid lawyer who has represented the
detainees. ``We're saying we're not sure the system is designed to
sort out the people who do not belong there.''
   The detainees are a minority among the 125,000 Cubans who arrived
during the five-month ``Freedom Flotilla'' from the Cuban port of
Mariel in 1980. Many of those who arrived were criminals or mental
patients freed from jails and hospitals.
   A few were arrested on arrival for crimes committed in Cuba.
Others were convicted of crimes here and turned over to the INS for
deportation after finishing their sentences. But Cuba wouldn't take
them back, so they remained in detention.
   Since the detainees never were officially admitted to the United
States, they have existed in legal limbo as ``excludable aliens.''
Courts ruled that the Cubans did not have to released and could be
excluded without legal protections.
   Then rioting erupted at federal prisons in Oakdale, La., and
Atlanta after the State Department's Nov. 20, 1987, announcement
that Cuba had agreed to take back more than 2,500 of the 3,800
Mariel refugees locked up nationwide at the time. The rioters,
wielding crudely fashioned weapons, took 145 hostages and burned
several buildings. One inmate was killed in the 11-day uprising in
Atlanta.
   The uprisings ended Dec. 4, 1987, after the government agreed to
a moratorium on deportations and a one-time-only Justice Department
review of each INS decision.
   INS spokesman Duke Austin in Washington said the agreement also
called for speedy reviews of inmates' cases, which have resulted in
the parole of about 60 percent of the detainees. Since the
uprisings, INS increased the number of review panels from four to 20.
   ``The reviews conducted by these panels go beyond anything that's
required by law or by court order,'' Cary Copeland, a deputy
associate attorney general, said Thursday. ``They're designed to
give the detainee and his representative every opportunity to tell
the panels anything they feel appropriate in reaching their
decisions.''
   So far about 2,500 Cubans have been paroled. Parole has been
denied to about 1,500 others who will continue to get annual INS
reviews but could spend years, even their lives, in INS custody even
through they have finished prison sentences for their crimes.
   About 115 are at a federal facility in Talladega, Ala., awaiting
word on whether they will be sent back to Cuba. The Justice
Department announced plans Thursday to deport 13 detainees. Leshaw
sued to block that, claiming the cases are entitled to additional
review.
   An additional 3,000 Cubans are serving jail sentences and
eventually will enter INS detention, either to be paroled or held
until Cuba takes them back.
   Unless another agreement is reached with Cuba, many will not face
deportation, but they will stay in jail indefinitely until an INS
panel decides they are fit for parole.

   The government raised cigarette prices
today, saying it wants to discourage heavy smoking and bring prices
more in line with production costs.
   The official PAP news agency on Sunday announced increases of
10.9 percent for all Polish-made cigarettes and 12.1 percent for
imported brands.
   Health officials have increasingly expressed concern about heavy
smoking among Poles. Cigarette consumption in Poland rose by nearly
a third between 1965 and 1985.
   Polish cigarettes cost an average of about 25 cents per pack. The
average monthly salary in Poland is about $100 at the official
exchange rate.

   Gambling that peace will prevail despite a
deadlock in Iraq-Iran peace talks, the United States' European
allies are stepping up the postwar dismantling of their military
forces in the Persian Gulf.
   In recent days the mine sweeper Crocus, the last of three Belgian
warships deployed to the gulf a year ago, sailed for home. The last
five Italian warships and one from the Netherlands are preparing to
leave by Dec. 31.
   Officials said those moves, like an earlier cutback in France's
regional fleet from 11 to seven ships, came because the Iraq-Iran
cease-fire, three months old Sunday, had brought stability to the
gulf.
   The European actions could add pressure on President-elect George
Bush to step up an American pullout, according to U.S. diplomats and
military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The United States has withdrawn one ship and scaled back convoys
and other operations. But its 25 warships represent about half the
foreign vessels in the region.
   Diplomats said defense budget cutters are likely to focus on the
operation, whose monthly cost the Pentagon estimated at $15
million-$20 million at its peak.
   U.S. officials, however, say the American commitment to
peacekeeping has led to the best-ever relations with the Arab gulf
states, and the Arab leaders remain nervous about a hasty pullout.
   ``They have made it clear they want us here and they aren't
pushing for us to leave too quickly,'' said a senior diplomat.
   U.S. military sources say Arab sensitivity to a U.S. pullout
prompted Pentagon officials in September to fudge reports on the
departure of the USS Vincennes, listing the cruiser as still on duty
nearly a week after it left the area.
   The Pentagon says decisions on reducing the U.S. Joint Task Force
Middle East _ 15 ships in the gulf and a 10 in the Arabian Sea _
depend on the Iran-Iraq cease-fire holding.
   The Pentagon has given no timetable for cutbacks but says the
gulf-based force eventually would revert to five or six ships, the
level before last year's buildup to protect shipping endangered by
the gulf's ``tanker war.''
   The U.N.-sponsored truce has held despite warnings from leaders
in both Baghdad and Tehran that fighting could resume if no peace
agreement is achieved.
   ``The general feeling seems to be that the (war) momentum in the
gulf is gone, and even if fighting started elsewhere it wouldn't
spread,'' a U.S. diplomat said.
   No incidents have been reported since the Aug. 20 cease-fire.
   Gulf Arab states have appealed to Iraq and Iran to help in
clearing mines that still pose a major threat to shipping.
   More than 500 commercial vessels were damaged and more than 300
sailors killed in attacks by both sides during the 8-year-old
conflict.
   The war led the Reagan administration and six other governments
to send or reinforce naval units in the gulf, which provides nearly
a fifth of the western world's petroleum.
   Congressional foes initially attacked Reagan's decision as
risking U.S. involvement in the war. The criticism later faded, and
some diplomats expressed amazement that the move scarcely was
mentioned in the campaign between Bush and Michael Dukakis.
   ``If anybody told me 18 months ago that we could have the biggest
single concentration of warships since World War II in the gulf,
with Iraq and Iran at war, and it wouldn't become an election issue,
I'd have said they were all wet,'' said a senior U.S. diplomat.
   Since the cease-fire, the United States has withdrawn one ship
and canceled deployment of another, reduced air patrols and removed
a fortified barge from the northern gulf.
   Instead of escorting commercial vessels in convoys, U.S. warships
now are posted along the 600-mile gulf to lend assistance if needed.
   U.S. military sources say there is no sign of cutbacks by the
Soviets, who have kept seven to nine ships in and near the gulf
since 1986.
   Just as President Reagan's move to expand the U.S. force was
prompted in part by that growing Soviet presence, diplomats say, any
major change by Moscow could influence the American withdrawal.

   Merrill Lynch & Co. and the National Urban League
today promised 250 first graders in 10 cities full college
scholarships or cash incentives if they stay in school through
graduation.
   The Merrill Lynch Foundation, the charitable arm of the nation's
largest brokerage firm, is underwriting the new
``ScholarshipBuilder'' program with an initial $500,000
contribution, or $2,000 per student, to cover college tuitions
estimated to reach $17,500 by the year 2000, when this year's
first-graders will enter college.
   Students preferring jobs or the military would still get a
one-time $1,000 cash payment to cover clothing and travel expenses,
provided they graduate from high school.
   ``You are the hope for our future,'' said Merrill Lynch chairman
William A. Schreyer in remarks prepared for delivery today at Rafael
Hernandez@Langston Hughes Elementary School in East Harlem,
one of the 16 schools chosen.
   ``That is why we are investing now in your higher education. In
return we want you to stay in school, to study well, to be free to
dream important dreams, and to know that you can make them come
true.''
   In addition to New York, the schools are in Atlanta, Boston,
Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and Washington. A
school in Philadelphia is to be named shortly, according to Merrill
Lynch.
   Other corporations and philanthropists have offered similar
incentives to persuade inner city children to stay in school.
Philanthropist Eugene Lang, for example, promised 61 East Harlem
sixth-graders full college scholarships if they stayed in school. A
group of businessmen called the ``100 Black Men of Atlanta'' is
acting as mentors to a class of 28 ninth-graders and is guaranteeing
their college expenses.
   But Schreyer said ``ScholarshipBuilder'' is different from other
such ``adopt-a-class'' programs:
   ``Our program begins earlier in the child's educational career _
first grade _ and provides funds not only for college or other
post-secondary education but also a stipend upon high school
graduation for students who immediately become fully employed or who
enter military service.''
   The foundation's future annual contribution could go up or down
to meet projected average college costs. But foundation president
John A. Fitzgerald estimated his fund would eventually contribute
about $8 million, which could appreciate to $16 million through
investments by the time students are old enough to draw upon it.
   The Urban League chose inner city schools that ranked high in
orderliness, attendance rates, parental involvement and other
``effectiveness'' measures. Students were chosen at random but with
an eye toward achieving ethnic and racial balance. The league will
continue to administer the scholarship program, including keeping
tabs on youngsters' progress.
   Asked whether Merrill Lynch would give preference to those
students who eventually wanted careers on Wall Street, Fitzgerald
said: ``I would say without committing us that we would, if they
were qualified.''
   The 15 other schools selected are:
   Capitol View Elementary, Atlanta; David A. Ellis Elementary,
Boston; Anthony Overton Elementary, Chicago; Goodale Elementary,
Detroit; James R. Reynolds Elementary, Houston; 74th Street School,
Los Angeles; Earlington Heights Elementary, Floral Heights
Elementary, Holmes Elementary, Martin Luther King Elementary,
Liberty City Elementary, Lorah Park Elementary, Olinda Park
Elementary and Orchard Villa Elementary, Miami; and Hendley
Elementary School, Washington.

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three men belonging to a ``skinhead'' gang
were charged in connection with the beating death of an Ethiopian
immigrant a week ago, police said Sunday.
   Kenneth Mieske, 23, Kyle Brewster, 19, and Steven Strasser, 20,
were charged in what police said was a racially motivated and
unprovoked attack on Mulugeta Seraw, 27, who had just been dropped
off by friends in front of his home.
   The friends, who tried to intervene, suffered minor injuries.
Seraw died a short time after the beating, in which his attackers
used a baseball bat.
   Mieske and Brewster were charged with murder and remained in
custody, said Detective Dave Simpson. Bond for Strasser, charged
with second-degree assault, was set at $100,000, Simpson said.
   Mieske, who also uses the alias ``Ken Death,'' was arrested early
Saturday, and Brewster and Strasser were arrested about noon Sunday,
he said. The three were to appear in district court Monday afternoon.
   Mieske and Brewster face additional charges of assault and racial
intimidation in a Sept. 10 incident at a grocery store, Simpson
said. A black security guard and several store employees forcibly
ejected a large number of ``skinheads'' about 11 p.m. that evening.
   In another charge that resulted from the homicide investigation
but was unrelated to Seraw's death, police and the FBI arrested
Michael C. Barrett, 20, and charged him with unlawful flight to
avoid prosecution and escape, Simpson said.
   The charge relates to a Redwood City, Calif., case involving
vandalism to a place of worship, he said.
   The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith said recently that
reports of violent crimes have surfaced in every area where skinhead
groups have organized. The civil rights group estimated in October
there were about 2,000 young people actively involved in skinhead
gangs in 21 states, but noted that many youngsters who adopt the
skinhead look reject the racist element.
   The skinhead subculture emerged in London as early as the 1960s.
Segments of the movement took on Nazi overtones in 1985 and since
have been supported by and associated with the white supremacist
Aryan Youth Movement and White Aryan Resistance.
   Portland has a skinhead group of about 20 called East Side White
Pride, with ties to the White Aryan Resistance, according to the
league. It also has a group called Preservation of the White
American Race, with about 10 members, half of whom are women, and a
suburban group, Youth of Hitler, the league said.
   Although police identified the suspects as part of a skinhead
gang, officers did not identify any group by name.

churchmen and art experts by putting one of Europe's greatest
medieval treasures on sale.
   The 708-year-old Mappa Mundi, Latin for map of the world, has
been kept in the cathedral for centuries and is to be auctioned by
Sotheby's in London in June. News reports put its value at more than
$4.5 million.
   The sale announcement Wednesday prompted a leading member of the
cathedral's fund-raising committee to resign in protest. Newspapers
have published angry editorials against the sale, and Hereford town
leaders have vowed to fight it.
   The map shows historical events, Bible stories, topography,
animals, plants and 420 cities on a 6-by-4 sheet of vellum.
   Jerusalem is at the center of the map while Hereford, 144 miles
northwest of London, is drawn on one edge.
   The controversy illuminates the dilemma faced by custodians of
Britain's national heritage. The 900-year-old cathedral in Hereford
is one of many in need of cash, but sales of treasures such as the
Mappa Mundi threaten to put the nation's historical heritage into
the hands of foreign buyers and remove them from Britain.
   The Dean of Hereford, the Very Rev. Peter Haynes, said in
announcing the sale of the map that cathedral authorities need to
clear a $273,000 overdraft and spend millions more on repairs, more
staff, the cathedral's choir and new premises for its library of
medieval books.
   Announcing his resignation from the fund-raising committee, Sir
Roy Strong, a former director of London's National Portrait Gallery
and Victoria and Albert Museum, said Thursday, ``I was very upset to
see the Dean standing outside his cathedral and holding up the Mappa
Mundi, its finest treasure, for sale to the world.
   ``If that is the kind of church they are running, I no longer
want to be associated with it.''
   Replied John Champion, chairman of the cathedral's appeal
committee: ``I am sorry he feels the way that he does ... Put
bluntly, it is a choice of what is more important, continuing the
work of the cathedral ... or retaining a marvelous medieval
treasure.''
   John Newman, deputy mayor of Hereford, a town of 48,000, said he
wants Queen Elizabeth II, as secular head of the Church of England,
to intervene.
   The map ``may legally be the cathedral's, but morally it belongs
to the citizens of Hereford,'' Newman said.
   Sotheby's says that as a national treasure, the Mappa Mundi is
equivalent to France's 11th century Bayeux Tapestry depicting the
invasion of England by William the Conqueror in 1066.
   Georgina Nayler, deputy director of the National Heritage
Memorial Fund, said: ``We are outraged that one of the most
important documents in the world is about to be put into an auction
room.''
   Lord Gowrie, Sotheby's chairman, strongly denies allegations that
no effort was made to find a British buyer.
   ``I am sorry that national institutions have not felt able to buy
this great map,'' said Lord Gowrie, adding that he spent more than a
year seeking a buyer among government-funded bodies such as the
British Library.
   The Daily Telegraph said Thursday that chances of the map staying
in Britain appear slim.
   Critics accuse Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative
administration of starving the arts of adequate government funding.
The government favors sponsorship of the arts by private industry.
   Dr. Richard Gem of the Cathedrals Advisory Commission for England
was quoted by The Times as saying many other cathedrals in financial
trouble may have to sell off ``very important treasures.''

   This is the final installment of an occasional
series that has told the story of the Drought of '88 through the
eyes of one farm family, the Chases of Barry County, Michigan.

   Gordon and Jean Chase prayed for rain all
summer long. Now they pray for just a few days of sunshine.
   In June, when hot, dry winds blew the dusty dirt off seeds that
wouldn't germinate _ when the worst dry spell since the Dust Bowl of
the 1930s left crops withered and stunted _ the Chases never
expected their fields would be too muddy at harvest time.
   ``We've never seen a year like this,'' Gordon Chase says, shaking
his head. ``We've gone from the worst drought in 50 years to one of
the wettest and coldest Octobers ever. One extreme to the other.''
   From April 1 through mid-July, the Chases' 1,100-acre cash-crop
and dairy farm in southwest Michigan's Barry County received barely
an inch of rain. Since Aug. 1, about 18 inches of rain and an inch
of snow have pounded the weak stalks of corn and wilted soybeans _
more than twice the normal amount of precipitation.
   The Chases aren't alone. Many of the same Midwest farmers who
struggled through the summer's devastating drought were taunted by
rains that came too late to do any good.
   The recent downpours, which have forced many farmers to delay
harvesting their shriveled crops, bring the year to a sad, ironic
close.
   This will be the first time in the Chases' 18 years of farming
that they will have no crop to sell. Everything they harvest will be
needed to feed their 300 head of beef and dairy cattle. With only
about half a silo full of high-moisture corn _ enough to last about
three months _ the Chases will have to buy from other farmers.
   ``A year like this makes you realize more than ever that the
weather is the farmer's biggest friend or worst enemy,'' Chase says,
sinking into a recliner in the couple's living room.
   He and his wife, both 51, estimate they lost about half their
corn and soybean crop, and all of the string beans they were growing
for a canning company. Their wheat crop was harvested before the
drought hit in May.
   But the Chases don't complain.
   ``At the height of the drought, you wondered whether you'd have
anything at all,'' Chase says with a shrug.
   The loss of their cash crop represents a 30-percent cut in the
Chases' income. To compound their financial plight, their expenses
have been 20 percent higher than normal, mostly because of the money
they spent on irrigation.
   But because irrigation only helps when there's some rainfall,
``we got zero out of that,'' Chase says in disgust, recalling the
summer nights he and his son, Kurt, spent in the fields baby-sitting
the irrigation system so that no water was wasted.
   The Chases are thankful their dairy herd, which represents about
60 percent of the farm's income, is healthy and productive. The
income they make on their cash crop usually covers their operating
expenses and pays for the 700 acres of land they rent _ about
$75,000 this year.
   ``It's really frightening,'' Jean Chase says. ``We don't know
where we'll get it, but it'll work out. ... We don't dwell on it
because it reminds us how horrible that loss really is.''
   The Chases also are thankful they have an understanding lender.
They're waiting to find out if they qualify for the federal
government's $3.9 billion drought-relief aid program.
   But they can't help but think back to their early spring
projections.
   On paper, this looked like it was going to be the family's most
prosperous year ever. After managing to save their farm from
foreclosure three years ago by deeding to the Federal Land Bank and
leasing it back _ parcel by parcel _ the Chases expected this year
would be the one to pay off a sizable chunk of the debt they had
accumulated.
   Now, all they'd like to do is finish harvesting by Thanksgiving _
a goal they've met every year. It seems unlikely this time.
   The Chases, who are in a partnership with son Kurt and
daughter-in-law Dena, pray for clear skies in order to harvest the
remaining acres of corn and soybeans.
   Every time it rains _ or snows _ several dry days must follow
before it's safe to take equipment out in the fields. They've
already had equipment stuck in the mud twice.
   ``Now all we can do is pray for a freeze,'' Gordon Chase says.
``But if it snows first, that'll just insulate it and it'll stay
wet.''
   And if the fields aren't harvested in the fall, it means more
work in the spring because the fields would have to be cleared
before planting.
   Meanwhile, the corn still standing in the brown, muddy fields is
growing moldy, rendering it useless as feed for the cattle. And with
each pounding rain, more of the weak crop is ruined.
   Still, the Chases look ahead with hope.
   ``I guess the thought of giving up doesn't enter my mind,'' Chase
says. ``Even though it has been a very trying year and very
frustrating, we have a lot to be thankful for and we survive because
we know next year will be better.''

<HEAD>Examples Abound Outside Convention on the Homeless</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conventioneers trying to figure out what to do
about the homeless didn't have to walk far from their luxury hotel
in the nation's capital to meet the problem face-to-face.
   Mitch Snyder, who runs a shelter in Washington, told the 800
people at the home builders symposium that they were ringed by the
homeless.
   It was not much of an exaggeration.
   Two blocks from the Washington Hilton, in an alley, a 64-year-old
woman in a smudged, ankle-length wool coat complained about her life
on the streets since her husband died in 1976 and she lost her
apartment.
   ``It's a crying shame that people have to live this way,'' said
the woman, who is among as many as 15,000 people who are sleeping
these cold autumn nights in the doorways of the nation's capital or
in crowded temporary shelters because they have no place to live.
   A couple of blocks further, at a subway entrance, Brian Curley,
32, held up a cardboard sign: ``Lost apartment to fire ... please
help ... all gifts are welcome.''
   Curley said he can get occasional work with demolition crews for
$70 a day, but had not earned enough to afford to eat and to rent
the cheapest rooms available in Washington, which he said require a
$150 advance payment for two weeks.
   ``I try not to look like a street person,'' he said. ``But I'm
lucky to get a shower. Hopefully by next week I will have amassed
enough of a fortune to spend Thanksgiving indoors.''
   Estimates of the number of homeless Americans range from 250,000
to several million. Experts agree that they will be a major
challenge for President-elect George Bush's administration.
   All surveys show that the numbers of the homeless are growing,
that they include increasing numbers of families with children and
that they are found in all parts of the country.
   Many are people who hold jobs but don't earn enough money to pay
rent or qualify for mortgages.
   The symposium, sponsored by the National Association of Home
Builders and an odd mix of establishment organizations and homeless
action groups, sometimes sounded more like a human rights conference
or tent revival than a gathering of mostly conservative business
people.
   Participants gave a standing ovation on Friday to Snyder, whose
shelter takes in hundreds of people every night.
   Snyder, who has slept for months on city grates, fasted and been
jailed in his 18-year battle for the homeless, accused the
government of turning its back on the nation's neediest citizens and
challenged the builders to cut their profits to help solve the
problem.
   ``No one has a right to more than they really need to live.
Anything beyond that is theft,'' he said.
   ``I may not be dressed as you are, but I ain't no different,''
Snyder said, standing at the podium in an olive drab jacket and a
knit shirt open at the collar. Most of his audience, about half of
them builders, were in business attire.
   After his speech, Snyder told a reporter the well-dressed crowd
was made up of ``decent people who struggle to be decent people.
That's all anyone can expect.''
   But Snyder's suggestion that the builders forsake profits to make
low-income housing more affordable didn't sit well with some of them.
   ``When you continue to talk about giving up some of your profits,
that ain't the way that America works,'' shouted builder Leon Weiner
of Wilmington, Del.
   Weiner said homelessness cannot be treated simply as a moral
issue. He said it requires a strong federal housing policy and
subsidies of low-income housing comparable to the billions of
dollars in tax deductions allowed on home mortgage interest.
   Kent Colton, builders association executive vice president, said
many builders have cut profits to build low-income housing, and the
industry has more than its share of bankruptcies.
   ``Builders are willing to be part of the solution,'' Colton said
in an interview, ``but leadership has to come from the federal
government. The new administration has the opportunity to focus on
the positive side of housing as a national priority.''
   The symposium included two days of meetings focusing on how
businessmen and others can help shelter the homeless, including
sessions on creative financing, job training and construction
methods. Some participants also toured homeless shelters in the
Washington area.
   A woman at a floor microphone during one session shouted an
appeal: ``If we get together and pray together we can do something
about this situation.''
   A Missouri priest, the Rev. Gerald Kleba, challenged each of the
nation's 400,000 church congregations to join local builders in
constructing one house apiece for the homeless.
   ABC-TV anchorman Peter Jennings, in a conference keynote speech,
called the homeless ``our brothers and sisters.''
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said some Americans are ``almost too
alone to live in a house.'' He said that simply building more
houses, particularly for the mentally ill, won't solve all the
problems.
   Conventioneers, who paid $95 apiece to attend the two-day
conference, passed by huge photographs of sorrowful women and
children and a naked man standing in a hall before a cluster of
wheelchairs.
   They ate elaborately prepared desserts at the end of a gourmet
luncheon and then were told that baskets of vegetables serving as
centerpieces would be donated to a homeless shelter.

   President-elect George Bush, faced with unease
in the financial markets over the gaping budge deficits, today will
name Richard Darman to run OMB and tap Stanford's Michael Boskin as
chief financial adviser, transition sources say.
   Bush scheduled a morning news conference today to make what his
office described only as an announcement about the transtion.
   But sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
president-elect has enlisted Darman as director of the Office of
Management and Budget and Boskin as chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers.
   Darman was the right arm of James A. Baker III throughout the
Reagan administration, both when Baker was White House chief of
staff and later as Treasury secretary. He played a behind-the-scenes
role in negotiating the 1983 rescue plan for Social Security.
   Darman was a whiz kid for Elliot Richardson as secretary of
health, education and welfare in the early 1970s.
   Boskin is a well-known conservative economist and expert on the
Social Security system. He was a father of Bush's ``flexible
freeze'' idea to drive down the deficit in four years.
   The stock market has sagged and the value of the dollar fallen
since Bush captured the White House Nov. 8 from fears that his
no-tax-hike pledge will impede efforts to bring down the deficit,
now growing by $155 billion a year.
   Bush has said he takes the deficit seriously and will work with
Democrats in Congress to forge a solution.
   Bush spent a quiet weekend out of the limelight, attending church
Sunday, jogging and conferring at home with Gov. John Sununu of New
Hampshire, his chosen chief of staff.
   Bush was also meeting today with two former presidents, Gerald
Ford and Jimmy Carter, who have made some bipartisan recommendations
for the incoming president.
   Also on Bush's schedule is a meeting with David Packard, the
computer magnate who headed a commission that recommended an
overhaul of Pentagon procurement procedures.
   Bush revealed last Tuesday he is keeping his friend Nicholas F.
Brady as treasury secretary. He told reporters Friday he was
concentrating on naming the rest of his economic team before turning
his attention to defense and national security posts.
   In Reagan's second term, Darman was deputy to Baker as treasury
secretary. Both left the government when Baker resigned in August to
run Bush's presidential campaign.
   Boskin argued in a recent book titled ``Too Many Promises'' that
the program should be overhauled to separate its welfare and pension
functions.
   Boskin proposed a two-tier system, with a flat monthly payment
aimed at helping people stay out of poverty and the second or upper
tier tied strictly to how much people paid into the system.
   Currently there is a sharp tilt to Social Security benefits, with
lower-income workers getting a far heftier return on their payroll
taxes than middle- and upper-income workers.
   Bush named Baker, his longtime associate from Houston, as his
choice for secretary of state the morning after the election.
   Brady, who served eight months as a caretaker senator from New
Jersey in 1982, was sworn in two months ago as Baker's successor at
Treasury. He is a former chairman of the investment banking house of
Dillon, Read & Co. Inc.
   On Tuesday, the president-elect plans to fly to Alabama to visit
a conference of Republican governors and to Houston for a
get-acquainted meeting with Mexican president-elect Carlos Salinas
de Gortari, who takes office Dec. 1.
   Sununu was preceding Bush to the GOP governors conference to
deliver a luncheon speech there today. The governors will also hear
from Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager and now his choice for
chairman of the Republican party.
   Bush will return to Washington Tuesday night, then fly Wednesday
to Kennebunkport, Maine, for a long Thanksgiving holiday weekend
that could include a fence-mending session with Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, the vanquished Democratic presidential nominee.

<TEXT>
   The federal employee drug-testing program
instituted by President Reagan will quadruple in size next year
unless stopped in its tracks by legal challenges.
   An estimated 50,000 employees were tested this year, mainly law
enforcement officers, transportation inspectors and civilians
working for the military.
   But the program is expected to test some 200,000 members of the
3.1 million federal work force in 1989, according to the National
Institute of Drug Abuse.
   About 150,000 to 170,000 of those will be tested at random and
come from a pool of some 500,000 workers in positions deemed
sensitive by their agency chiefs.
   The remainder will be tested after accidents or when supervisors
believe there is reasonable suspicion of drug use.
   Those figures do not include untold numbers of federal job
applicants who will be tested if applying for sensitive positions,
nor do they reflect the Transportation Department's far-reaching
requirement to test nearly four million private sector
transportation workers _ from truckers to airline pilots. That
program would begin late next year for businesses employing more
than 50 workers. Those with fewer than 50 would have two years to
get ready for testing.
   Most suits against testing, many filed by unions, are in federal
district or appeals courts. Only two have been argued before the
Supreme Court, but neither involves the random testing that has been
challenged as an intrusive, unconstitutional search.
   ``By the first of the year most all of the tier one (the 42
largest) agencies, the largest chunk of the work force, will have
their programs up and running,'' said Dr. Michael Walsh, director of
the National Institute of Drug Abuse's Office of Workplace
Initiatives. The office coordinates and approves federal testing
plans.
   The testing program has its origin in a Sept. 15, 1986,
presidential order directing that federal workplaces be drug-free.
Besides testing, other components include training supervisors to
recognize symptoms of drug abuse among employees, and counseling
programs at federal agencies.
   The counseling is mandatory for those who test positive. Workers
can also make voluntary use of the programs, as can members of their
families.
   Once entering the counseling program after a positive test, most
workers will suffer no disciplinary action if follow-up tests show
they refrained from drug use.
   ``The purpose is to get a person back on the job,'' Walsh said,
but he cautioned that workers can be disciplined at the discretion
of their agencies for continued drug use.
   In the most sensitive law enforcement and national security jobs,
workers can be fired the first time drug abuse is discovered, Walsh
said.
   The program has held up well so far in court decisions.
   One suit challenged Reagan's 1986 executive order as
unconstitutional, but a Louisiana judge dismissed the action.
   A federal judge in the District of Columbia held the random
portion of the Army's civilian testing program unconstitutional. But
the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington invalidated the decision
pending appeal, and the Army continued testing.
   The Transportation Department's internal testing program was
upheld by a federal judge in Washington, including after-accident
testing challenged by air traffic controllers.
   In a California case, however, a federal judge stopped the Bureau
of Prisons from testing anyone except applicants for employment.
   Justice Department employees in Washington sued their own agency
to stop random testing, and won an injunction in district court.
Arguments are set for Dec. 15 before the U.S. Court of Appeals.
   There has been no decision in a suit challenging testing in the
Veterans Administration.
   The cases argued before the Supreme Court on Nov. 2 involve the
Federal Railroad Administration and the U.S. Customs Service. But
since neither involved random testing, they might not decide the
broad constitutionality of the entire testing program.
   The FRA issued orders in 1985 that required railroads to take
blood and urine specimens _ for alcohol and drugs _ after accidents,
incidents and rules violations.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last February that
the tests are unreasonable searches banned by the Constitution's
Fourth Amendment. But the court stayed its decision in order to
allow an appeal to go forward, and testing continued.
   The Customs Service requires tests for anyone applying for a
promotion or transfer to a job involving drug enforcement. That
program was upheld by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Testing is ``obviously a violation of individual privacy and the
Constitution, because of its provisions against unreasonable search
and seizure,'' said Diane Childers, spokeswoman for the American
Federation of Government Employees _ a union that has filed several
lawsuits against Reagan's program.
   She added that random testing ``does not indicate on-the-job
impairment,'' and requires no probable cause or even reasonable
suspicion of drug use. Ms. Childers said the union does not oppose
after-accident testing.
   John Bolton, chief of the Justice Department's civil division,
disagreed, saying, ``We're not talking about the exercise of
government police power or generalized searches of people as a
whole.''
   He added there's a ``diminished expectation of privacy'' in many
sensitive federal jobs, which begin with an FBI background check.
``Many of those jobs require a physical exam with urinalysis
required,'' he said.
   Bolton said Health and Human Services Department guidelines have
strict test controls. Procedures for custody of the samples are
carefully controlled to avoid mixups, there are strict criteria for
testing laboratories, test evidence is not to be used in criminal
prosecutions and there's no observation of the worker giving the
sample. A collection person of the same gender will be in the
bathroom, however.
   Testing is for five drugs: cocaine, marijuana, PCP, opiates and
amphetamines.

   The turkey's big day is this week, but thanks
to a lot of scientific derring-do the old bird has turned into a
year-round sort who is welcome almost anytime.
   Another result is that pampered, commercially grown male turkeys
have become so large they aren't effective lovers. So the females
have to be artificially inseminated.
   When founding father Benjamin Franklin proposed the turkey as the
symbol of the newly born United States _ he thought the eagle was
rather a scoundrel _ it was the trim, hard-muscled wild turkey Ben
had in mind.
   The wily wild turkey still thrives in woodlands and is much
sought by hunters. And it is still trim and muscular.
   Sandy Miller Hays of the federal Agricultural Research Service
says Franklin ``might scarcely believe his eyes if he could see
today's turkey, with its blossomed breast and extra servings of
favored white meat.''
   Hays, writing in the agency's Agricultural Research magazine,
noted that per capita consumption of turkey rose from a paltry 2.8
pounds in 1940 to 15.2 pounds in 1987. This year consumption is
expected to average 16.5 pounds, and a slight rise is forecast for
1989, perhaps to 16.6 pounds.
   Much of this increase has come since 1980 and can be attributed
largely to more processed turkey products such as turkey ham, turkey
bologna, turkey franks and other items, not to mention packaged
parts.
   But before turkey ham and all the others, the Agriculture
Department had already started to help move turkey production out of
the doldrums, she said. In those days after World War II, large
domestic turkeys were enjoyed _ for a day or so _ but a good portion
of the leftovers lingered on and on and on.
   Thus, most families steered clear of turkeys except for those
special occasions such as Thanksgiving.
   In 1947, after a decade of development, the USDA commercially
introduced the Beltsville Small White turkey, named after the
department's research center in Beltsville, Md., where the bird was
developed.
   After only seven years, in 1954, the Beltsville turkey
represented 28 percent of the 67 million birds produced that year.
   The new birds averaged around nine pounds when shipped to market,
compared with 15 pounds or so for the other commercial breeds.
   Today, the genes of the Beltsville Small White are spread among
many of the modern breeds. One of the prized characteristics was its
reproductive capabilities, says Thomas J. Sexton, a poultry
physiologist and director of the agency's Livestock and Poultry
Sciences Institute at Beltsville.
   Sexton said the Small White female could crank out more than 100
eggs in six months, handily topping the output of other commercial
breeds.
   Another benchmark development came in 1980 when Sexton and other
agency researchers hit upon the Beltsville Poultry Semen Extender, a
mixture that allowed turkey semen to be stored for six to eight
hours without losing viability.
   All commercial turkeys are produced from artificial insemination.
   ``If we left it up to nature, the reproductive rate of domestic
turkeys would be about half of what it is now,'' Sexton said. ``If
you artificially inseminate a flock, you can expect a 90 to 95
percent fertility rate in the eggs produced. But in a naturally
mated flock you might get 45 to 50 percent.''
   Sexton said the male turkey used for breeding may average 40 to
50 pounds, compared with 25 pounds or less for the female.
   ``And there's a big difference in attitude in these big males,''
he said. ``They're more interested in eating than mating.''
   Before the Beltsville Poultry Semen Extender was perfected,
turkey semen had to be used within 30 minutes after it was
collected. That meant the toms had to be on the same farm with the
females.
   The extender sent most of the toms to market and allowed those
remaining to be bunched together on turkey stud farms, Sexton said.
   Sexton said the extender allows a single male to inseminate as
many as 40 females a week, compared with only about 10 before.
   The nation's turkey output jumped sharply in 1987 to a record of
more than 240 million birds and another 5 percent increase is
expected this year, according to the department's Economic Research
Service.
   Half a dozen states produce more than two-thirds of the turkeys,

<HEAD>Democrats Considering Shorter Presidential Selection Process</HEAD>

   After their first post-election meeting, the
Democrats are determined to avoid wholesale revisions of their rules
but are ready to consider major changes in the presidential primary
and caucus calendar.
   The 1992 presidential campaign may see a drastically altered
Super Tuesday and find Iowa and New Hampshire deprived of their
first-in-the-nation status.
   ``Everybody thinks the thing ought to be shortened,'' said Texas
Democratic Party chairman Bob Slagle, echoing a sentiment expressed
by several of his colleagues.
   ``I'm going to tell you, everybody's damn tired of rules
changes,'' said Slagle. ``And I think the average Democrat thinks
we're absolutely insane if we get into another big battle about
rules.
   ``They want us to worry about how we're going to win elections.''
   Sam Goddard, the Arizona chairman, speaking for the Western
states, said, ``We are concerned in our region about the timing and
sequence of the presidential primaries and caucuses.''
   One idea that got a lot of favorable attention at the meeting of
the Association of State Democratic Chairs was to hold a lottery to
determine which states would lead off the process.
   While not endorsing the proposal, national party chairman Paul G.
Kirk Jr. called it an idea worth considering.
   Kirk said that if the parties move toward regional primaries
``there ought to be one or two smaller states that begin the
process.''
   One regional primary that may not be repeated in the form it had
in 1988 is Super Tuesday, the day that most Southern states agreed
to hold their primaries.
   The motivation behind Super Tuesday was to give the process a
more conservative voice. But the big winner on that day was Jesse
Jackson and the eventual nominee was Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis.
   Kirk called Super Tuesday ``too large and too widespread'' to
give the region an effective voice.
   John Baker, chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party, and Kathy
Vick, a former Louisiana party chair, both said they opposed
continuation of Super Tuesday.
   Baker said he favored moving the Alabama primary to June when the
state votes to nominate candidates for other offices.
   That move, said Baker, would save the $1.2 million it costs to
hold a separate presidential primary.
   Baker and Vick also endorsed the idea of asking Congress to enact
lottery legislation or some other method of shortening the primary
season and removing Iowa from its status as the first state to begin
selecting delegates.
   After their fifth defeat in the last six presidential elections,
many Democratic officials are saying that Iowa plays too much of a
role in defining the nominating campaign debate.
   Neither the Republican nor Democratic caucus winner in Iowa won
his party's nomination, but the state was the scene of most of the
early campaigning.
   For the Democrats, in particular, that meant pressure to take
stands on defense and other issues that party officials now feel
were out of touch with the feelings of most voters.
   Another issue that dominated discussion at the state chairs
meeting was the question of whether Kirk would agree to serve
another four years as chairman.
   Kirk disclosed that among those urging him to seek another
four-year term were Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, the party's
presidential and vice presidential nominees.
   But Kirk said he had not made up his mind and would not until
after Thanksgiving.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Democrats Could Turn Atwater Choice to Their
Advantage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When President-elect George Bush chose Lee
Atwater to pilot the Republican Party into the 1990s, it was a
warning and an opportunity for the Democrats.
   Atwater is the nation's leading practitioner of the ``politics
ain't beanbag'' school of campaigning, the man who made rapist
Willie Horton a household name and turned the Pledge of Allegiance
into an attack on Michael Dukakis.
   There was nothing pretty or ennobling about the strategy Atwater
pursued as manager of the Bush presidential campaign.
   But it worked and his candidate carried 40 states and will become
the 41st president of the United States on Jan. 20.
   Dukakis and his handlers consistently underestimated Atwater and
his tactics.
   In the euphoric spring and summer days when the Massachusetts
governor had double-digit leads in every poll, Democrats generally
shrugged off the attacks on the Massachusetts prison furlough
program and the questions raised about Dukakis' veto of legislation
to require public school teachers to lead the Pledge of Allegiance.
   Dukakis partisans called the attacks typical of Atwater's
fondness for negative campaigning. The Bush campaign manager was
panicking, they said.
   They were wrong. Atwater had a far better understanding of
Dukakis' vulnerabilities than did the Democrats.
   Now the Bush campaign manager is undertaking a different role at
a critical political juncture.
   From the initial reaction of Democratic state party leaders, they
don't intend to make the mistake of underestimating the young
political tactician from South Carolina.
   ``We're ready to take on Lee Atwater and those who create a pit
bull style of politics,'' said Rick Wiener, chairman of the Michigan
Democratic Party.
   ``I don't intend to get out-muscled,'' said Bob Slagle, the Texas
Democratic Party chairman. ``I don't intend to let them play that
kind of game with us and win it.''
   The Democrats were sending a clear message: We can get just as
tough and negative as Atwater.
   But they went beyond that. They also were jumping at an
opportunity to make Atwater himself a political issue.
   One of the ironies of the 1988 campaign was that while voters'
opinion of Dukakis was formed to a great extent by the Bush attacks,
they objected to the negative tone of the campaign.
   The question now is whether there is enough of a hangover from
the nasty tone of the presidential campaign to tar Atwater.
   Democratic Party chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. was asked if he looked
forward to working with Atwater, the way he had often cooperated
with current GOP chairman Frank Fahrenkopf.
   Kirk gave a low-key response but made his point.
   ``I don't know Lee Atwater,'' he said. ``But from what I've seen
he probably brings a slightly different approach to the public
domain and politics than I would have.''
   Warming to the subject, he continued, ``I want to be fair to Lee
Atwater, if that's not being too naive. I don't want Lee Atwater
setting the tone for politics in the 1980s and 1990s _ at least from
what I've seen in the most recent campaign.''
   The stakes will be high for both parties when Atwater assumes his
new role just before Inauguration Day in January.
   In the presidential campaign, Atwater was operating in an area
where the Republicans have a built-in advantage. Going into 1988,
GOP candidates had won four of the last five presidential elections.
Bush made it five of the last six.
   But when Atwater takes over at the Republican National Committee,
he'll be trying to overcome a big Democratic advantage in
congressional and local elections.
   The 1990 elections will determine who draws the new district
lines for the House of Representatives as well as for states
legislatures.
   Right now, the Democrats control 28 state legislatures, while the
Republicans are a majority in only eight. In 13 states, each party
controls one of the two legislative bodies. Nebraska has a
nonpartisan unicameral legislature.
   In addition, 28 of the nation's 50 governors are Democrats.
   The importance of redistricting was demonstrated in the last two
elections when only a handful of incumbents seeking re-election were
defeated.
   The political success of House incumbents suggests that the only
possibility of a major shift in the party lineup comes once every 10
years, in the election following the redrawing of district lines to
comply with a new census.

<HEAD>CIA Says U.S. Incomes More Than Double Soviet Figure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The average American earned $18,200 last year
compared with the equivalent of $8,362 for the average citizen of
the Soviet Union, the Central Intelligence Agency says.
   The figures are contained in the CIA's recently released
``Handbook of Economic Statistics _ 1988,'' which compared actual
purchasing power.
   The CIA figured the total production of 243.8 million Americans
in 1987 was worth $4.436 trillion, while 284 million Soviets
produced $2.375 trillion.
   Americans also live longer to enjoy their prosperity: 75 years to
69 for the average Soviet, according to the CIA. But residents of
several other countries have longer average lifespans than those of
Americans: 78 years in Japan, 77 in Italy, Holland and Canada, and
76 in France and West Germany.
   The agency said the United States had the highest average income
in the leading Western industrial countries known as the Group of
Seven. Canada was second with $17,080, followed by West Germany with
$13,360, Japan $13,180, France $12,780, Britain $12,260 and Italy
$12,080.
   The CIA did not give figures for Switzerland, where according to
the World Bank, average income was higher than in the United States:
$21,250 compared with $18,430.
   Communist-ruled countries were well behind, with East Germany
doing best at $11,873, according to the CIA.
   The average in China was only $273 compared with $4,320 on
Taiwan. Among other countries of east Asia, Hong Kong did best with
$8,250, followed by Singapore with $6,810, and South Korea was last
at $2,810.
   The CIA said U.S. economic production grew last year at a rate of
2.9 percent, compared to a Soviet increase of just 0.5 percent. But
it said the Soviets devoted a larger proportion of their income to
investment than Americans, and a smaller proportion to consumption.
Economists consider this relationship important, since investment is
seen as the key to the wealth of the future.
   The Soviets, though they still import much of their grain from
the United States, have been improving their own farm production
faster: 17 percent more in 1987 than in 1980, compared with a 4
percent increase in the United States.
   Prices paid by Soviet consumers also have been rising more
slowly: 14 percent since 1980, compared with 38 percent in the
United States.
   The CIA said its information on Communist-ruled countries came
from official data, its own estimates or estimates made by other
organizations.

   Less than a year after the death of
his cancer-stricken wife, Dr. Peter Rosier shocked television
viewers when he admitted, ``I administered something to terminate
her life.''
   Now the 47-year-old Fort Myers pathologist is on trial here on
charges of first-degree murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to
commit murder in the Jan. 15, 1986, death of Patricia Rosier, his
wife of 23 years.
   Mrs. Rosier, 43, suffered from lung cancer, which doctors say had
spread to other organs.
   The state contends the interview, broadcast Nov. 12, 1986,
amounted to a confession. Rosier admitted his wife didn't die of
cancer. He said she wanted to die before the situation became
horrible and that he merely helped her on her way.
   ``There was no question Patricia Rosier wanted to end her life,''
said Assistant State Attorney Ed Volz, who expects to finishing
presenting his case before Thanksgiving. The trial, now in its
fourth week, was moved from southwest Florida because of extensive
pretrial publicity.
   Rosier gave his wife 20 pills of Secanol _ a strong sedative _
and when that didn't work, he gave her morphine injections, then
morphine suppositories, prosecutors said.
   During the trial, however, Mrs. Rosier's stepfather, Vincent
Delman, has described in detail how he smothered her after Rosier's
botched attempts.
   ``I decided to gently cover her nose and mouth,'' Delman
testified, demonstrating on himself for the jury. ``I didn't give it
a second thought ... I didn't get any pulse ... I didn't hear any
more sound.''
   Delman, 68, a retired New York dentist, said he was afraid she
might become a ``vegetable'' after Rosier left her unconscious and
lingering near death for 12 hours.
   ``He obviously didn't do such a good job,'' Delman said, adding
that he decided, ``Enough is enough.''
   He testified as a key state witness under a grant of immunity.
   No charges were filed against him because he and his two sons,
Russell and Farrell Delman, successfully negotiated an immunity
agreement before prosecutors knew the extent of their involvment.
They are the state's star witnesses.
   The defense said the state was taken.
   ``This is not a murder case. It is wrongful prosecution,'' said
defense attorney Stanley Rosenblatt, who hasn't decided yet whether
to put Rosier on the stand. ``Prosecution is a face-saving device.''
   However, the state maintains it had no choice. Without the
Delmans' testimony, there was very little on which to build a case.
No autopsy was performed, and Mrs. Rosier was cremated 52 hours
after her death.
   Even if they had known beforehand, prosecutors still would have
extended immunity to the Delmans, testified James Fitzpatrick, lead
investigator.
   ``It changed nothing,'' he said. Rosier ``orchestrated his wife's
death.''
   Through a prior arrangement, permitted in terminally ill cases,
Rosier called the Lee County Medical Examiner's office and told
coroners officials his wife was dying. She was placed on an expected
death list. No autopsy would be necessary. A death certificate
signed by one of her treating physicians attributed death to lung
cancer, according to testimony.
   Attorneys for both sides agree the couple made a double suicide
pact after Mrs. Rosier's cancer was diagnosed in spring 1985.
   But Rosier didn't go through with it for the sake of his
children, Jacob, now 19, and Elizabeth, 21, Volz said.

<HEAD>Activists Aim Voting Rights Act at State Judge Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights activists say a decision by the
Supreme Court to stay on the sidelines in a Louisiana case leaves
the field clear for their attempts to give black voters more say in
the selection of state judges.
   Frank Parker, an attorney with the Lawyers Committee for Civil
Rights, said the court's refusal last week to hear Louisiana's
appeal of a ruling that the Voting Rights Act applies to state
judicial elections ``gives the green light'' to lawsuits challenging
the election process for judges in six states.
   The suits have been filed in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas,
Illinois and Ohio.
   The lawsuits represent a new wave in litigation under the 1965
law, which has been used by legal activists during the past decade
to force hundreds of local governments and school boards across the
South to abandon at-large elections of their members.
   The demise of at-large elections has coincided with a huge
increase in the number of black elected officials at the local
level. Between 1977 and 1987, the number of blacks on county
commissions, school boards and city councils nationwide increased
from 3,515 to 5,490.
   ``They're trying to accomplish exactly the same thing with the
judiciary that they've accomplished with legislative offices,'' said
David Boyd, an Alabama attorney hired to represent the state in a
lawsuit challenging the election method used for circuit court and
district court judges.
   Parker said activists initially focused on removing barriers to
the election of blacks to legislative offices because that's where
policy is set and laws are enacted.
   Now, he said, the challenges directed at state judicial systems
may be even more important in ending racial discrimination.
   ``In terms of the impact this litigation has, it's very high,''
he said. ``Judges have the power to put people in jail for long
periods of time; they have the power to put people to death. The
business of state courts ... is very critical to the lives of
minorities.''
   The lawsuits contend that at-large elections of judges violate
the Voting Rights Act by diluting black voting strength and denying
blacks an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.
   In an at-large judicial election, two or more judges are elected
by all the voters of a jurisdiction created by the state. The
lawsuits contend that black voters have little chance to elect
judges of their choice when they live in majority-white
jurisdictions, even though they may constitute a majority in a
specific section of the jurisdiction.
   That argument already has prevailed in three states. In North
Carolina, a federal lawsuit challenging the method of electing
Superior Court judges was withdrawn after the Democratic-controlled
Legislature last year adopted a new judicial districting plan
acceptable to civil rights advocates.
   In Mississippi, where the first lawsuit using the Voting Rights
Act to challenge state court elections was filed in 1984, a federal
judge divided eight districts where state court judges were elected
at-large into 22 single-member districts, including 14 that are
majority black. The first elections under the new plan will be held
in February.
   In Louisiana, a federal judge ruled in favor of civil rights
activists in a similar lawsuit and instructed the Legislature to
develop a new election plan for state trial court judges that does
not violate the Voting Rights Act.
   The Louisiana case that reached the Supreme Court last week
involved a challenge to the at-large election of two state Supreme
Court justices from a district made up of four parishes. The
lawsuit, still awaiting trial, asks for the creation of two
single-member districts, with one being majority black.
   Louisiana officials argued that the Voting Rights Act should not
apply to judges because it only covers ``representatives'' of the
people, namely members of the legislative and executive branches of
the government.
   The Supreme Court's decision not to hear Louisiana's appeal
leaves the issue of whether the Voting Rights Act applies to
judicial election without a final resolution for the time being.
   But some lawyers who are using the voting law to challenge state
judge elections say the court's silence suggests that it believes
the law does apply, particularly since several state judicial
systems already are being revamped because of rulings based on the
voting law.
   ``I think the court would have taken the first one it had if it
disagreed with (the lower court) because they wouldn't want a state
to go through the change and two years later say, `now it's time to
look at this,''' said Neal Bradley, an American Civil Liberties
Union attorney who is representing the black voters in the Georgia
lawsuit.
   Georgia Attorney General Mike Bowers, however, said he sees no
hidden meaning in the Supreme Court decision. He said the court's
action last week won't stop him from contending that the Voting
Rights Act does not apply to judicial elections in Georgia.

<TEXT>
   Food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco Inc. on Sunday
extended its deadline for buyout offers after a potential new bidder
said it was considering making a record offer of up to $26.6 billion.
   The tentative proposal for RJR Nabisco from a group led by the
investment firm First Boston Corp. and the Pritzker family of
Chicago would be nearly double the biggest acquisition on record,
Chevron Corp.'s $13.4 billion purchase of Gulf Oil Corp. in 1984.
   The First Boston proposal, its first expression of interest in
the consumer goods giant, easily topped two sweetened offers made by
RJR management and the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
   RJR Nabisco, which is based in Atlanta, is the nation's 19th
biggest industrial company, and the maker of hundreds of consumer
items that range from Jose Cuervo tequila and Salem cigarettes to
Life Savers candy and Milk Bone dog snacks.
   The offers disclosed Sunday top all previous bids, and a special
RJR committee that is running the auction indicated that its
decision to extend the bidding period could produce even higher
offers.
   ``Due to the varying potential values and nature of the
consideration offered in the two bids and the proposal, and the
varying terms, conditions and contingencies associated with each,
the special committee determined not to make any recommendation at
this time'' regarding any of the proposals, said Charles E. Hugel,
the committee's chairman.
   The five-member committee of RJR Nabisco's board of directors
also said it would accept bids through Nov. 29. The panel had
initially cut off bidding at 5 p.m. last Friday.
   The preliminary offer by the First Boston-Pritzker group would
involve the acquisition in 1989 of RJR's tobacco business, which
accounts for about 40 percent of its annual sales, followed by the
installment sale of its food businesses.
   First Boston indicated the total consideration could range from
$98 to $110 cash a share, plus securities and stock warrants valued
at from $7 to $8 a share. The warrants would entitle RJR
shareholders to acquire up to 20 percent of the tobacco business.
   At $118 a share, the maximum possible offer from the group would
be $26.6 billion.
   The committee said the management-led group, which is allied with
the investment firms Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon
Brothers Inc., had raised its offer to $100 a share in cash for 175
million of the company's 225.3 million outstanding common shares.
   The group said it would acquire the remaining shares for $56
cash, plus securities and common stock in the surviving company that
it said would bring the total consideration to $100 a share. The
common stock would equal about 15 percent of the surviving company's
outstanding shares, according to the special committee.
   The $100 a share offer values RJR at $22.5 billion. The
management group's previous offer had been for $92 a share, or $20.7
billion.
   The new offer by Kohlberg Kravis _ which previously had offered
$90 a share, or about $20.3 billion _ included $94 cash a share for
about 178 million RJR Nabisco shares, with the remaining shares to
be exchanged for preferred stock and securities the firm valued at
$94 a share, giving its offer an indicated value of about $21.2
billion.
   Management started the bidding a month ago when it announced it
was considering a buyout offer, and Kohlberg Kravis quickly entered
the fray with a competing bid.
   Both parties submitted firm offers to the RJR committee by
Friday's deadline, but they said late Sunday they were undecided
whether to make new offers.

<HEAD>Extra Control Room Shifts Added at Problem-Plagued Reactor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Efforts to fix problems that stopped
production at the only U.S. facility able to produce nuclear weapons
material intensified today with the addition of extra control room
shifts at the Savannah River plant.
   Federal officials also are expanding their on-site control as
part of a sweeping safety drive that makes it unlikely the plant
will meet a Dec. 31 goal for resuming production.
   Creating an extra, fifth shift for each of the plant's three
reactors means that one of the 14-member control-room teams will be
undergoing training at any given time.
   The crews will double the time they spend each year on a computer
simulator, up to 150 hours, and classroom work will be expanded as
well, said Charlie Ahfield, a Du Pont reactor program manager.
   Putting federal officials permanently inside each reactor
facility, for the first time, will allow the government to keep a
closer eye on their operation, which has been run since 1950 under
contract by the E.I. du Pont de Nemours Co.
   The changes are designed to improve safety at the sprawling
300-square mile site in a pine forest along the Savannah River,
where more than 16,000 employees work under tight security.
   The scene is surprisingly tranquil outside K reactor, the first
of the three scheduled to return to operation. Inside the massive
concrete and reinforced steel structure, workers use remote-control
cranes and arms to prepare the reactor for restart.
   ``They had set a target date of Dec. 31, but I would think it
would be after the 31st,'' said Andy Cwalina, a Du Pont reactor
supervisor. No new date has been announced.
   Changes also are taking place in the administration complex, ``a
beehive of activity,'' said Stephen R. Wright, a 14-year veteran of
the plant and deputy manager of the Energy Department team preparing
to restart K reactor.
   The reorganization, which began several years ago, widened this
fall.
   The top Energy Department safety official, Richard W.
Starostecki, warned in September that some senior federal officials
at the plant had ``an attitude toward production reactor safety,
which on the face seems to be similar to that which existed in the
space program prior to the Challenger accident.''
   Such criticism raises hackles at Savannah River.
   ``NASA killed 10 people. We never injured anybody with a nuclear
accident,'' said Andy Cwalina, a reactor supervisor, referring to
the seven people killed in the Challenger shuttle disaster and three
killed in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
earlier Apollo program.
   ``Our people have never hesitated, if they were concerned about
safety, to order a reactor shut down,'' said Cwalina. ``One thing
that we are learning is that you have to instill confidence among
your overseers that you are operating a reactor safely.''
   That means convincing Washington the aging reactors can run
safely at 100 percent power, rather than the 50 percent ceiling they
have been under since a critical report last year by the National
Academy of Sciences.
   Safety measures being instituted at Savannah River include:
   _Raising operating standards to the same level as those attained
by commercial nuclear utility plants in the wake of the accident at
Three Mile Island in March 1979. That ``will take years,'' according
to Wright. A key to this is developing detailed mathematical models
of how the reactor core behaves, especially during problems.
   _Establishing ``a paper trail, from the cradle to the grave,''
for important steps, said Wright. ``Before, I used an informal note.
Now I use a quality control form. And more people receive copies.''
   _Assuring that each shift is supervised by an operator who holds
a bachelor's degree in science or engineering. Nine of the 12 shift
teams meet that standard now.
   _``An increase in oversight from Washington, an increase in line
control, an increase in overview and management. And Du Pont is
increasing its overview,'' said Wright.
   In one key change, engineers from the Energy Department regional
office at the plant will be stationed permanently at each reactor
and managers and inspectors who previously visited the reactors only
on a spot basis ``will be going out considerably more'' said Wright.
   ``The biggest increase will be technical review engineers. These
are the guys that will be living out there. Plus there will be
technical inspections,'' said Wright.
   U.S. officials say the nation still has enough nuclear materials
for weapons, for the time being.
   Plutonium supplies are adequate, according to Energy Secretary
John S. Herrington, but tritium, which decays at the rate of 5.5
percent per year, could be running short by next summer, say
administration and Capitol Hill sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.

   Ending a three-day visit to India,
Mikhail S. Gorbachev joined with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in
urging the United Nations to help establish a coalition government
in Afghanistan.
   ``A U.N.-supported international conference may be needed for
this purpose,'' the two said in a statement released before the
Soviet president returned home Sunday night.
   The communique did not reflect a change in the Kremlin's
position, but it coincides with increasing Soviet efforts for a
political settlement of the war. After nine years of Soviet military
intervention, the war still rages.
   Under a U.N.-sponsored accord signed in April, the Soviet Union
is to complete the withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan by Feb.
15. About half the estimated 100,000 Soviet soldiers have left,
although the withdrawal of troops was halted earlier this month
because of recent rebel successes.
   Gorbachev and Gandhi also signed an agreement for the Soviet
Union to build two nuclear reactors for an Indian power plant.
   During the visit, the Soviet Union and India concluded agreements
for economic, scientific and cultural programs worth $5.3 billion,
said an Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman.
   The statement on Afghanistan said ``the process of national
reconciliation should be encouraged.''
   ``National reconciliation'' is the term President Najib of
Afghanistan has used in his efforts to persuade anti-communist
guerrillas to stop fighting and participate in his government.
   Gorbachev and Gandhi appealed to U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar ``to implement without delay'' a Nov. 3 U.N.
resolution that calls for an end to foreign interference and for the
creation of a broad-based government in Afghanistan.
   The Soviet Union has been distancing itself from Najib and his
Soviet-style People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan as the
deadline for the Red Army withdrawal approaches. But it has provided
new warplanes, surface-to-surface missiles and economic aid to
bolster the government.
   On Saturday, Gorbachev accused the United States and Pakistan _
the chief backers of the Afghan guerrillas _ of creating obstacles
in settling the Afghan problem.
   The nuclear power agreement signed by Gandhi and Gorbachev calls
for the Soviet Union to build two 1,000-megawatt reactors within 10
years in southern Tamil Nadu state.
   It was not disclosed what safeguards the Soviets would impose for
India's largest nuclear power project. India has been hampered in
getting Western assistance for its nuclear projects because it has
refused to open its plants for international inspection.
   India advocates nuclear disarmament but has refused to sign the
Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, saying the pact discriminates
against developing nations.
   The Soviets and Indians also agreed to cooperate in the
exploration of space in the coming decade.

<HEAD>Republicans Raked in $20 Million in `Soft Money' for Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush won the presidential election with
a boost from dozens of wealthy supporters who pitched in by giving
$100,000 or more to the Republican Party, GOP records show.
   In addition to the Republican ``Team 100'' roster of people who
gave at least $100,000, a list released by party officials shows
millions more collected from supporters who gave amounts ranging
upward from $5,000.
   The Republican National Committee made public a list of
contributors who gave about $20 million to its so-called soft money
account _ money that legally cannot be donated directly to a
presidential campaign but which the party can spend on a variety of
election-related activities that end up benefiting the presidential
candidate.
   The Republicans had a banner year with their soft money program,
the records show, allowing them to more than double the $46 million
in public funds that the presidential nominees are allowed to spend
themselves. That money comes from the $1 voluntary checkoff on
individual income tax returns.
   The RNC list of heavy hitters includes such GOP stalwarts and
longtime Reagan loyalists as Walter Annenberg and Trammell Crow, as
well as corporate donors such as RJR Nabisco, Revlon, Occidental
Petroleum and Coca Cola.
   New York real estate mogul Donald Trump gave $100,000.
   Also listed is William Stamps Farish III, a multimillionaire oil
man and horse breeder who hosted Bush, his close friend, on the
president-elect's post-election beach vacation last week in Gulf
Stream, Fla.
   Farish is listed as having given $75,000.
   Also listed were Henry Hillman and Elsie Hillard Hillman of
Pittsburgh, Pa., who hosted Bush during the Florida vacation on a
yacht cruise with several friends.
   But the list the RNC gave to reporters may reveal only a portion
of the amount a given contributor actually has donated.
   RNC officials said this list, which includes 78 donors who gave
$100,000, did not include all the contributors, and did not give a
full accounting for the donations because some people also gave
money also to separate ``Victory '88'' accounts that the party set
up in each state.
   Money given to these accounts, often at high-dollar fund-raisers
attended by Bush while he was on the campaign trail, was not brought
into the RNC accounts in Washington.
   Party officials have refused to disclose those funds and are not
required by law to do so.
   The Democrats also had an active soft money program and have
disclosed receipts.
   The soft money system is criticized by many as a blatant loophole
that gets around election-law limits on political spending.
   It enables the parties to accept money that otherwise would be
barred from presidential campaigns, including corporate money and
individual donations exceeding the $1,000 cap set by election law.
   The money was used for generic party advertising,
get-out-the-vote efforts and such things as buttons and bumper
stickers.
   Following is a list of those who gave the RNC $100,000, and where
noted, more than that amount:

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen
Monday, while share prices rose moderately on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 122.52 yen, up 0.12 yen from Friday's close
of 122.40 yen. Opening at 122.40 yen, the currency moved in a narrow
range of 122.37 yen and 122.60 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 103.39-point
winner Friday, added another 104.06 points or 0.36 percent to finish
at 29,284.26, a new record high. On Friday, the index closed at
29,180.20.
   The dollar traded around its opening level in Tokyo as the market
turned increasingly cautious about selling the U.S. currency
following concerted intervention Friday by the world's major central
banks, said a dealer at the Bank of Tokyo.
   Because of the extent of intervention Friday during both European
and New York dealings, there is no apparent force in the market now
to push the dollar down further, he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   But he said upward momentum was also absent.
   ``Although the dollar-yen rate is stabilized for the moment, it
doesn't mean participants are willing to buy the dollar,'' he added.
   On the stock exchange, ``market players were interested in wide
variety of issues,'' said an analyst with Nomura Securities, Japan's
largest brokerage.
   ``It's a sign that more people are looking for places to invest
their money,'' he said, asking that he not be identified.

<HEAD>Book: Lincoln Assassination A Confederate Intelligence Plot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX DOMINGUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Wilkes Booth wasn't a shiftless actor
who killed Abraham Lincoln out of despondency over the South's loss
in the Civil War, but a Confederate intelligence agent, a new book
contends.
   Confederate leaders sanctioned the assassination as a last-ditch
effort toforce the North into peace negotiations, three former U.S.
intelligence officers wrote in ``Come Retribution,'' recently
published by the University Press of Mississippi.
   Booth also used an underground intelligence network for his
escape after shooting Lincoln during a performance at Ford's Theatre
in Washington, D.C., on April 14, 1865, five days after Gen. Robert
E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox, the authors contend.
   ``The book challenges the long-held belief that, in the closing
months of the Civil War, the Confederacy stubbornly held out against
surrender even though it had no hope of winning its independence,''
William Tidwell, one of the authors, wrote in a recent article.
   ``It shows instead that the Confederates had a well-developed
plan for the campaign of 1865 which they believed would result in a
Southern victory or at least a stalemate.''
   The Confederacy had wanted to kidnap Lincoln, but when that plan
failed, it plotted to blow up the White House, Tidwell said. The
bombing plan was aborted when a Confederate demolition expert was
arrested, Tidwell said.
   Southern leaders finally decided to kill Lincoln, demoralize the
North and begin a last ditch offensive, Tidwell said. Lee's
surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia had virtually ended the
war by that time, but Booth thought he could save the South by
killing Lincoln, said Tidwell, a retired CIA officer.
   Tidwell's co-authors are James Hall, a retired Labor Department
official who served in Army intelligence during World War II, and
David Winfred Gaddy, a former National Security Agency official.
   Tidwell said the three used their intelligence experience to
re-examine the assassination and uncover what they alleged was a
well-established Conferederate intelligence network. They examined
thousand of documents in the National Archives over a 10-year period.
   ``Our evidence is largely circumstantial,'' Tidwell said.
``Basically, we are trying to tell our story by putting together
many small pieces of information, each well documented.''
   The authors contend Booth was not helped during his escape by
strangers or a rag-tag band of sympathizers hastily assembled before
the assassination. Instead, Booth appears to have followed the main
Confederate underground network leading from Washington to the
Confederate capital in Richmond, Va., the book contends.
   Of the 17 who helped Booth's escape, the authors were able to
link 12 with the Confederacy, eight of whom had participated in
Confederate intelligence activities.
   The authors also elaborate on the activities of a Southern
intelligence operation that spied in Washington, New York and
Chicago.
   The book's title comes from a code system the Confederate
intelligence used in which a certain word or phrase was used to
decipher messages.
   ``Come Retribution'' was the last code key used by Confederate
intelligence, Tidwell said. A chart used to decipher the code was
found among Booth's effects after he was shot by Union soldiers 11
days after the assassination of Lincoln.

<HEAD>Product Safety Chairman Quitting For Think Tank Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Terrence M. Scanlon, a Democrat who has
promoted voluntary safety programs as the Reagan administration's
chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, is resigning to
take a post with a conservative think tank.
   The Heritage Foundation said Sunday that Scanlon would become
vice president and treasurer of the organization effective Jan. 3.
   One of the highest ranking Democrats in the Reagan
administration, Scanlon has run his agency with a philosophy close
to President Reagan's emphasis on voluntary safety programs and
cooperation with industry.
   Consumer advocates attacked his approach and urged promoting
product safety more aggressively, but Scanlon responded that
voluntary programs can be established more quickly than government
regulations.
   ``You can do a voluntary standards approach at the same time you
have an enforcement program,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Scanlon said that under his leadership, the independent agency's
civil penalties against companies violating safety standards reached
an all-time high.
   Scanlon cited as a major accomplishment of his tenure at the
agency an agreement last year to cooperate with the U.S. Customs
Service in halting imports of unsafe products before they reach
domestic store shelves.
   A former aide to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, Scanlon served
in the Small Business Administration and Commerce Department before
he was appointed to the safety agency.
   He was the agency's chairman from December 1985 to December 1986,
but had to relinquish the post when Congress failed to confirm his
appointment within a year.
   The delay coincided with an investigation of charges that Scanlon
had used the commission's staff for personal projects. He was
exonerated of any criminal wrongdoing and was confirmed as
commission chairman in July 1986.
   The commission consists of five members, and a quorum of three is
needed to conduct business. Currently, only three commissioners are
serving because Congress has not provided funds for the two
remaining positions.
   Scanlon's departure would leave only Carol Dawson and Anne Graham
as commissioners, too few for the agency to conduct business.
   Scanlon will be in charge of fund raising and financial
management at the Heritage Foundation, which also has attracted
several former Reagan administration officials including former
Attorney General Edwin Meese and former U.N. ambassador Charles
Lichtenstein.

<HEAD>Trying To Cross Into United States, Canadian Learns He's A Criminal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARNPRIOR, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Schinkel says he didn't know he
had a criminal record until he was barred entry into the United
States.
   After a U.S. customs officer did a computer check, Schinkel, 41,
was told there was a record of a narcotics offence _ cultivation of
marijuana _ that meant he wasn't allowed into the country.
   Four years ago, police seized two marijuana plants from
Schinkel's garden at his home in White Lake, Ontario, near Arnprior.
   When he went to court, Schinkel received a conditional discharge
and the judge told him he was a lucky man because he wouldn't have a
criminal record.
   But the United States records as convictions all sentences handed
down by Canadian courts _ discharges included.
   ``As far as we are concerned, a conditional discharge is the same
thing as a conviction,'' said John Hogan, port director for U.S.
immigration at Alexandria Bay, N.Y. ``We don't recognize Canadian
pardons either.''
   Schinkel's experience ``points out something pretty outrageous,''
said Ottawa lawyer Bob Wakefield. ``The whole intent of the
discharge provisions in Canadian law is to remove any stigma, any
prejudice attached to the person involved.
   ``But what's really amazing here is we are supplying (U.S.
officials) with information about discharges, knowing it is being
used in a manner that clearly undermines the intent of Canadian
law.''
   The legal hitch meant trouble for Schinkel, a woodworker.
   When he was refused entry to the United States in March at
Cornwall, Ontario, Schinkel _ determined not to cancel a Florida
vacation _ tried again down the road at the Ivy Lea Bridge, near
Gananoque, Ontario.
   Another computer check showed Schinkel had tried to cross the
border only a few hours before, and Schinkel says U.S. customs
officials held him for 4{ hours for questioning.
   He said he was was photographed, fingerprinted, and officials
confiscated his girlfriend's pickup truck and sent him back across
the bridge on foot to Canada.
   Six months later, Schinkel says, he got the truck back after
paying a $500 U.S. penalty.

   An off-course bull moose nicknamed
Bullwinkle was looking for a mate, but probably attracted only
camera-toting spectators.
   On Saturday morning, Roger Bonsall said the 6-foot-tall,
900-pound moose stopped for a drink at a drainage ditch at his farm
about 10 miles west of Liberal, a southwest Kansas town of 15,000
people.
   The moose, which sports a hefty set of antlers, spent the day
there, lying under some trees and allowing 50 to 75 sightseers to
get a good look.
   ``A lot of neighbors stopped by to take pictures, and he didn't
seem to mind that,'' Bonsall said. ``He'd just sit there and look at
you. He did have some dogs bark at him. He got up and chased one of
them a little bit.''
   By Sunday morning, Bonsall said the moose hit the road.
   Officials from the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks said
Bullwinkle may be the same bull moose that moved through Kansas this
fall and was last seen in Texas.
   ``It sounds like the same one,'' said Mike Ehlebracht, a
conservation officer. He said the moose was seen around the Saline
River in September, then traveled through Kansas and Oklahoma before
being spotted in Texas. That moose, which had a 40-inch rack of
antlers, was one of two moose spotted in Kansas this fall.
   Ehlebracht said moose visits to Kansas are unusual, but during
the fall mating season, a bull moose will take off looking for a
place to call home and ``just keep right on going.''

   Most preachers use the pulpit to land
converts, but Darrell Tielkemeier is more at home with a trailer and
a citizens band radio.
   ``Remember, truckers, Jesus loves you and we do, too, at the
Chapel of the Open Road,'' Tielkemeier's voice crackles over the
airwaves.
   The former trucker's message has become a familiar one on the CB
channels west of Chicago. He monitors his CB from the front seat of
his pickup, looking for souls to save on a chilly Saturday night.
   The 55-year-old Tielkemeier invites truckers to stop by his
chapel _ a 32-foot trailer parked in the back of a service station
on Interstate 90.
   Since he set up his trailer chapel, Tielkemeier says he has
persuaded about 15 truckers to dedicate themselves to Christianity,
and he has counseled many more. The chapel is open Friday and
Saturday nights and Sunday mornings.
   Tielkemeier says he understands temptations because he was a
drinker and a brawler in his younger days.
   ``Now I know since I've gave my life to the Lord that he gave me
this big body and these big hands to love people with, not to hurt
'em,'' said 6-foot, 240-pound Tielkemeier.
   Since his born-again conversion in 1973, Tielkemeier has
remarried his wife after a 10-year separation and settled down to
hold a steady job at a General Motors Corp. plant in Janesville, Wis.

   Under Canada's parliamentary system, voters choose a member of
Parliament from their district and don't vote directly for a party
leader. But three men symbolize their parties and stand to become
prime minister.

   BRIAN MULRONEY
   He led the Progressive Conservative Party to a smashing victory
in 1984 and became prime minister. Born in Quebec of working-class
Anglo parents, he is the first bilingual native of that
French-speaking province to lead his party.
   The 49-year-old Mulroney eased smoothly from being a lawyer to
his successful political career. He is a strong, emphatic public
speaker.
   His term was marked by general economic prosperity during which
more than 1 million jobs were created and inflation remained stable
at about 4 percent. He was able to distance himself from eight
Cabinet ministers who resigned in successive scandals.
   Mulroney started the campaign hoping to persuade voters to return
him as the most competent leader, but the free trade pact he signed
with President Reagan quickly became the No. 1 election issue.

   JOHN TURNER
   The 59-year-old Turner inherited the Liberal Party leadership
from Pierre Trudeau, returning to politics as prime minister in 1984
after eight years as a corporate lawyer.
   He called an election two weeks later and was quickly ousted,
serving as prime minister only 79 days.
   Turner survived three internal attempts to oust him as Liberal
leader since 1984. He started this year's campaign with the Liberals
in apparent disarray but forged ahead with his persistent attacks on
the free trade agreement.
   Turner was born in England but came to Canada as a child. He was
Trudeau's finance minister from 1972 to 1975, and opponents call him
the father of the modern Canadian deficit for allowing government
spending to rise substantially.
   His home district is in Vancouver, British Columbia.

   ED BROADBENT
   A political science professor turned politician, Broadbent now
has led his party in four national elections.
   His integrity and personal credibility have helped the New
Democrats build their strongest national profile ever.
   At the outset of the campaign, there even was talk that they
could finish second to become the official opposition. Yet the
Liberals' revival appears to have pushed back the New Democrats to
their traditional, third-place role.
   Broadbent, 52, opposes the free trade agreement but tried to
campaign on a broader platform on issues such as day care and the
environment. The New Democrats claim to represent the average
Canadian more than the other parties, which they charge are beholden
to other interests.
   Broadbent is from Oshawa, Ontario, an auto center just east of
Toronto.

<TEXT>
   The Society of Professional Journalists has
voted to drop the Greek letters Sigma Delta Chi from its name.
   The society was founded in 1909 at DePauw University as Sigma
Delta Chi, or SDX, accepting only men as members. In 1969, it
allowed women to join and added ``The Society of Professional
Journalists'' to its name a few years later.
   Delegates at the organization's 79th annual convention on Sunday
approved the name change by 197-66, ending a nearly 20-year debate.
   The organization also approved a resolution urging
President-elect George Bush to step up efforts to win the freedom of
American hostages Alann Steen, a journalism teacher, and Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
The two were abducted in Lebanon.

   Here are some facts and figures on the Canadian election:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE STAKES _ Canadians are electing a House of Commons newly
expanded to 295 seats, so a party needs 148 seats to form a majority
government.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE VOTERS _ There are 17.1 million eligible voters. Polls open
from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. in each district. Across the nation that means
they open at 7:30 a.m. EST in Newfoundland and close at 11 p.m. EST
in British Columbia.
   The first returns are expected about 9 p.m. EST, but it could be
well into the night before the outcome is clear. Voter turnout in
the last Canadian national election on Sept. 4, 1984, was 75 percent.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE MAJOR PARTIES _ They are the incumbent Progressive
Conservative Party led by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, the
opposition Liberal Party led by John Turner and the socialist New
Democratic Party led by Ed Broadbent. In 1984, the Conservatives won
211 seats, the Liberals 40, the New Democrats 30, and there was one
independent. The House of Commons then had 282 seats.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE KEY ISSUE _ The free trade agreement with the United States
scheduled to take effect Jan. 1 overshadowed all other issues in the
seven-week campaign. The Conservatives say the agreement will
guarantee future Canadian prosperity by securing access to the
larger U.S. market. The Liberals and New Democrats oppose the pact,
saying it endangers Canadian sovereignty and such crucial social
programs as senior pensions and health care.
   The U.S. Congress has approved the agreement, but it still needs
final Canadian parliamentary approval. Only a Conservative majority
government ensures that the agreement will proceed.

   You'd think an 81-year-old Texan would be
satisfied with a string of careers that reads: star of radio,
records, movies and TV, broadcast czar, real estate tycoon, baseball
mogul.
   But singing cowboy Gene Autry is back in the saddle with a new
pursuit: preserver of the American West, real and legendary, at a
museum underwritten with more than $50 million from his foundations.
   The Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, which opens Tuesday,
traces the West from prehistory to conquistadores to Lewis and Clark
to cowboys to Hollywood images.
   It's meant as a gift to the world, not a monument to himself,
said Autry, who first sang on radio in 1928, made 95 films, had a TV
show from 1950 to 1955, and cut 635 records, including ``Rudolph the
Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' ``Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine,'' and the
signature ``Back in the Saddle Again.''
   Autry hung up his performing spurs in 1956, and by the mid-'60s
owned part or all of nine radio and TV stations, four hotels, the
California Angels, 16,000 acres in Colorado, oil, music publishing,
a movie studio. Along the way he started collecting Western
memorabilia and art.
   ``I felt that I owed something. The West has been very kind to me
over the years,'' said Autry, whose net worth is about $230 million,
according to Forbes magazine.
   ``I figured that the least I could do is leave something for the
youth so they can see what it was all about.''
   Autry's tile-dotted, Spanish-style museum has seven main
galleries with 51,000 square feet of space, each featuring a
``spirit'' or aspect of the West. The building cost $34 million and
houses $20 million worth of exhibits.
   It has two exhibition halls, a theater, library and restaurant on
13 acres in Griffith Park.
   ``He had been thinking about this for 30 years, 40 years,
collecting artifacts of the West as he went from town to town,''
said the museum's executive director, Joanne D. Hale.
   The exhibits were designed by Disney's Imagineering team to
delight as well as instruct. Bridles and six-shooters gleam like
jewels suspended on clear plexiglass holders; items behind glass in
the galleries come to life in a 3-D movie with ``magic'' Disney
pioneered at its theme parks.
   The aim is to capture not only the West romanticized by artists,
authors and Hollywood, but the reality of frontier life, said
curator James Nottage.
   ``You expect that someone is going to save pistols owned by
Custer, so it's not surprising that we have those,'' Nottage said.
``The hard items to find are the common ones.
   ``So we're proud of things like a simple day dress from the
1840s. What are the odds of an item like that surviving?''
   Nottage shows off a collections of items used by Mexican cowboys,
the original range riders, such as a mid-1700s Saltillo serape worn
to ward off the weather. He hopes to expand the museum's displays of
items about women, minorities and business people in the West.
   But it's the romance of the dime novel and matinee that's the
long suit for now.
   Visitors can toss a leg over a saddle and fire a six-shooter as
they become part of a ``movie'' using the television technique that
superimposes weather reporters over their weather maps.
   Or they can just peruse:
   _Guns owned by Annie Oakley, Wyatt Earp, Jesse James; saddles
from Buffalo Bill Cody and bronc-busting legend Yakima Canutt;
Autry's own guitars, their necks inlaid with his name in
mother-of-pearl.
   _Cecil B. DeMille's camera from the 1914 version of ``The Squaw
Man,'' the Western often described as the first full-length picture
shot in Hollywood.
   _Costume after costume: Tonto and the Lone Ranger's get-ups,
Clint Eastwood's ``Pale Rider'' long coat, the eye-assaulting
glitter of country-western outfits from Nudie's Rodeo Tailors of
North Hollywood.
   _Ed Bohlin show saddles dripping with what looks like a ton of
silver.
   Among Autry's favorite items are an 1870s-era steam fire engine
from Nevada, a collection of Theodore Roosevelt memorabilia, and a
collection of more than 100 guns from Colt, including several made
for presidents, which Autry purchased from the famous firearms
company.
   ``They were actually offered more money than I paid for it,'' he
said. ``But whoever was bidding on it was going to sell some of the
most important items, maybe trying to get their money back. So I
told the people at Colt the collection would not be broken up.''

<HEAD>Japanese, Americans Differ On Trust For Each Other</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the 10th straight year, Japanese named the
United States as their most trustworthy ally, but a simultaneous
survey on the other side of the Pacific found Japan fell to 11th
place among nations Americans trust.
   The annual poll, conducted in September and published today in
the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest-circulation newspaper, asked
people to choose the most trustworthy from a list of 30 countries.
   According to Yomiuri's Gallup poll, 56 percent of Japanese
respondents, up 4 points from last year, said they considered the
United States the most trustworthy country.
   The survey of 2,212 Japanese adults, picked randomly across the
country, listed Britain as the second most trustworthy country,
followed by Australia, China and Switzerland.
   In the United States, Japan's trustworthiness fell from ninth
place last year to 11th in a survey of 1,030 Americans, aged 18 or
above and picked at random in 50 states and the District of
Columbia, the daily said.
   Americans picked Canada as the most trustworthy country with 76
percent, followed by Britain with 51.7 percent, Australia 50.3
percent, Switzerland 43.5 percent and Sweden 35.4 percent.
   In the survey, 42 percent of the Japanese viewed relations with
the United States as either very good or good, up nine percentage
points from last year, the Yomiuri Shimbun said.
   The number of Americans who said relations were good or very good
was 48 percent, the same as last year, it said.

   Radical students yelling ``Yankee go
home!'' tried to storm the U.S. Embassy's information office today
and smashed its lobby with steel rods before being repulsed by
police, authorities said.
   Eight police officers and two of the attackers were hurt, police
said, adding that one officer was hospitalized in serious condition.
   Ten of the students were arrested in the assault, the latest in a
series of attacks by radicals on U.S. facilities in Seoul and other
Korean cities.
   Police officers, who declined to be named, said about 15 students
rushed the United States Information Service (USIS) office in the
heart of Seoul shortly after noon. The students hurled a firebomb
that caused an explosion, and swept past police guards.
   Screaming anti-American slogans, the students forced their way
through the main door into the lobby, police said. They could not
get through a second door into the building and began smashing the
lobby with the steel rods.
   Riot police attacked the protesters with tear gas and overpowered
them during a fight lasting several minutes, police said.
   U.S. Embassy officials said no Americans were injured in the
attack. The 15-minute incident occurred at lunchtime when the
building was nearly empty, they said.
   Senior police officers said the students were seeking an end to
American influence in South Korea and wanted the removal of U.S.
forces based in the country.
   Anti-American students set fire to nine vehicles in an attack
Thursday night on a U.S. military housing complex in Seoul and
injured two American soldiers. Radicals also staged numerous
anti-American demonstrations in Seoul this summer.
   The USIS office, which provides a library and other services for
Koreans, has been attacked several times by radicals in recent
years. The office is a block from city hall and several hundred
yards from the embassy.
   Radicals are demanding the withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops
based in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty. The radicals
contend the United States has supported authoritarian rule in South
Korea and seeks to dominate the nation.
   American troops have been based in South Korea since U.S. forces
intervened to aid the south against a 1950 invasion by communist
North Korea that triggered the Korean War.

<HEAD>Report: U.S. Favors Stability Over Rights in Indonesia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. should help promote human rights in
Indonesia instead of turning its back on abuses for the sake of
stability, a private American human rights monitoring organization
said.
   Asia Watch said in a report released Sunday that rights abuses,
including torture by police and political killings on the Southeast
Asian archipelago continue but that the region is stable enough for
the U.S. to press its ally for more improvements.
   ``Neither the U.S. Embassy nor the U.S. State Department has
placed promotion of human rights high on its agenda of foreign
policy goals in Indonesia,'' Asia Watch said.
   ``These issues demand increased attention among U.S. officials
(because) throughout the 1980s, formal controls on political life
... have expanded and ... and a broadening cross-section of
Indonesian society has suffered politically-motivated human rights
violations'' including police torture and killings and lack of free
press or speech.
   Asia Watch attributed American silence to ``the persuasive power
of the `cult of stability''' among Washington policymakers.
   Indonesian President Suharto ``has deftly deflected criticism
from abroad by continuing to evoke images of the instability
associated with the tenure of President Sukarno,'' who ruled with
communist support before Suharto took power in 1965.
   Asia Watch singled out the former Portugese colony of East Timor,
which Indonesia annexed 13 years ago, as an example of Indonesia's
violation of human rights despite what the report said were
improvements on the island. Residents ``continue to suffer daily
violations of fundamental rights'' and Indonesia fails to account
for thousands of missing people believed killed in custody.
   Asia Watch is affiliated with Americas Watch and Helsinki Watch,
which monitors compliance with the 1975 Helsinki East-West
conference agreements on security and cooperation.

<HEAD>Egypt, China Recognize Palestinian State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egypt, the only Arab country formally at
peace with Israel, has recognized the newly proclaimed Palestinian
state and expressed hope its declaration will contribute to peace
and stability in the region.
   China also announced Sunday it had recognized the state declared
last Tuesday by the PLO's parliament-in-exile, making it the largest
Communist country to back the Palestinian claim to a homeland.
   The Soviet Union has expressed support ``in essence'' of a new
Palestinian state, but has yet to issue formal recognition.
   Egypt's statement came a few hours after Israel's ambassador,
Moshe Shamir, called on Foreign Minister Esmatt Abdel-Meguid to
brief him on the Israeli government's position regarding the newly
proclaimed state.
   The Palestine National Council, meeting in Algeria, proclaimed
the state _ in Israeli-occupied territory with Jerusalem as its
capital _ and also endorsed U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, implying
recognition of the state of Israel.
   Israel has rejected the move, saying the Palestine Liberation
Organization has neither explicitly recognized Israel nor renounced
terrorism.
   In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Sunday he was
upset by Egypt's decision. ``I regret it very much,'' he said
without elaboration.
   More than 30 countries, most of them Moslem, have recognized the
Palestinian state.
   An Egyptian government communique said Sunday that ``as Egypt
blesses this constructive step, it hopes that it (the proclamation)
would serve the cause of peace and stability in the region.''
   Israeli officials have argued that Egypt would violate the 1978
Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt if it recognized the
Palestinian state.
   The U.S.-mediated Camp David pact called for the final status of
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized in the
1967 Middle East war, to be negotiated in peace talks among parties
to the Middle East conflict. In the territories, the Palestinians
are engaged in an 11-month uprising that has claimed the lives of
more than 310 Palestinians and of 11 Jews.
   The Egyptian statement on Sunday, read to reporters and carried
by the state-run Middle East News Agency, said its recognition
should be effective Nov. 15, the day the PLO body proclaimed the
state.
   The statement complained that ``some quarters'' have persisted in
casting doubt on Egypt's position of support.
   ``To uproot these doubts ... Egypt hereby affirms its recognition
of the Palestinian independent state according to the points that
came in the political statement issued by the PNC (Palestinian
parliament) and considers this recognition effective since Nov. 15.''
   The Chinese statement, carried by the official Xinhua News
Agency, said: ``The Chinese government, with full respect for the
choice made by the Palestinian people, has decided to recognize the
state of Palestine.''
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat pressed his efforts Sunday to gain more
recognition. He and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein urged non-aligned
countries to recognize fully the newly declared state, the Iraqi
News Agency reported.
   Monitored in Nicosia, the agency said both voiced ``satisfaction
over the historical decisions'' taken by the Palestine National
Council. The two were meeting in Baghdad.
   King Hussein of Jordan said Sunday the PLO has met U.S.
conditions to join in Arab-Israeli peace talks and suggested Israel
and the United States were blocking peace.
   ``I believe the PLO has gone as far as it was asked to go and has
contributed its share for progress toward a just and comprehensive
peace,'' he said on CBS television's ``Face the Nation.''

Election</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Canada-Elections, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Canada's largest supermarket chains is
encouraging its workers to back the U.S.-Canadian free trade pact,
joining several other companies using similar tactics to try to
affect today's elections.
   Along with their paychecks last Thursday, Loblaws workers
received a seven-page letter from company president David Stewart
supporting the free trade accord with the United States.
   The Loblaws letter claims the deal, which requires Canadian
parliamentary ratification, could knock 8,000 Canadian dollars
($6,480) off the price of a house ``or an extra $20 (Canadian) off
the price of winter coats for the kids this year.'' The U.S.
Congress has already approved the measure.
   At least one worker thinks the letter is an attempt to intimidate
employees into voting for the Progressive Conservatives, the
governing party and architects of the controversial deal.
   The Liberals and New Democratic Party oppose the pact.
   ``They should give people free choice. That's the way it's
supposed to be,'' one Loblaws worker was quoted as telling the
Toronto Star newspaper.``I don't think they should do anything like
that.''
   A company spokesman denied the letter is meant to sway workers
into voting for the Conservatives.
   ``It was a personal message that was meant to be non-political in
nature,'' said Michael Arnett, Loblaws vice-president of
merchandising and development.
   The retail giant, which employs 33,000 workers at stores across
the country, is one of several large corporations to have entered
the free-trade debate by calling on workers to support the deal.
   Stelco Inc., a Hamilton steel manufacturer with 12,500 employees,
and Canadair, a Montreal aircraft company, have distribted similar
letters to their workers.
   Ford Motor Co. made a video of president Ken Harrington defending
the deal. The tapes were sent to the company's factories in Ontario,
said spokesman Jim Hartman. Some plants chose not to show the video
to employees, he added.
   Several other companies have distributed pro-free trade leaflets
produced by the Canadian Alliance for Trade and Job Opportunities.

<TEXT>
   Only his head and shoulders were visible
above the witness box as the boy calmly told a murder trial jury
how, when he was 2 years and 10 months old, he watched as his aunt
was grabbed and thrown down by a man with a knife.
   ``I saw a knife in his case on his belt _ I thought it was a
gun,'' the boy said softly, recounting events that took place eight
years ago. ``She was, like, pulling around his shoulders and pushing
him away from her.''
   From divorce battles to child abuse cases to murder trials, child
witnesses, once rarely seen in court, are appearing regularly in
thousands of proceedings, legal and psychiatric experts said.
   Opinion varies widely on the reliability of child witnesses and
on whether the stress they suffer in a courtroom is worth the
testimony they provide. Psychiatrists cite symptoms like nightmares,
confusion and guilt in young witnesses.
   ``It's not that difficult at all to get a child to say `nay' to
questions the child was saying `yea' to a few minutes before,''
defense attorney Frank Mondano, who was involved in a child abuse
case against a Massachusetts day care center, said of
cross-examining children.
   ``You don't know whether they are with you or in a childlike
world.''
   Prosecutors said the testimony of the 11-year-old boy in
Middlesex Superior Court last month was critical in the murder case
against William Brown, who was accused of stabbing the boy's
12-year-old aunt to death. But the boy couldn't positively identify
Brown as the attacker, the jury failed to reach a verdict, and the
case must be retried.
   Many methods have been used to smooth the road for child
witnesses. Some have been struck down as unconstitutional, others
have withstood appeals.
   In Minnesota, a child frozen with fear was permitted to testify
from beneath the prosecutor's table.
   In Philadelphia, a 5-year-old used a doll to demonstrate how her
father allegedly beat her younger sister. As a hushed courtroom
watched, the girl tossed the doll in the air. After it landed on the
floor, the girl walked down from the witness stand and began
punching it in the stomach.
   ``Where child victims used to be rare, now you're seeing many
more children coming into the system and that has required making
some accommodations,'' said Jane Walsh, a Middlesex County assistant
district attorney who has worked on many child abuse cases.
   Other changes include mandatory psychiatric evaluations before a
child is allowed to testify; special training for judges handling
child witnesses; and victim-witness advocates in prosecutors'
offices who work with families to make the experience less stressful.
   ``Children are quite honest,'' said Dr. Robert Nardone, head of
New England Medical Center's child psychology center, who frequently
evaluates potential child witnesses.
   ``If they are giving you an accurate version, they are
consistent,'' he said. ``A lot of people are concerned they are
being prepped. You usually can tell.''
   The stress associated with testifying can be especially acute
when a child is asked to give evidence against a parent or other
relative in a child abuse case, said Dr. Alayne Yates, chief of
child psychiatry at the University of Arizona.
   Problems can include ``staying awake at night, ruminating about
what they said and feeling responsible for the person being in
prison, and very sorry,'' she said.
   The younger the witness, the more acute the stress, said Yates,
adding that when she began her career in 1973 such cases were
``extraordinarily rare.''
   The number of child abuse cases nationwide has more than tripled
in a decade, according to the American Association for Protecting
Children, a Denver-based organization.
   In 1976 there were 669,000 cases but by 1986 the number jumped to
2.1 million. Of those, about 40 percent are ``substantiated'' to the
point where they may be brought to trial, said association
researcher Brandon Ruiz.
   In most of those trials, the testimony of the child victim is
required to prosecute the case.
   Judges are less willing to put children through the trauma of
testimony in divorce and custody battles than in criminal cases, but
children are often asked to take sides in a battle between parents.
Parents sometimes falsely accuse one another of sexual abuse to win
custody, Yates said.
   ``The child is liable to lose contact with a father who's a
valuable parent and sometimes whether the abuse happened or not,
they come to the feeling that it must have happened,'' she said.

   Lee Harvey Oswald bore a grudge against Texas
Gov. John Connally and may have intended to kill him instead of
President John F. Kennedy, according to a new book.
   Oswald was angry because Connally had done nothing to help
restore his honorable discharge from the Marine Corps, according to
the book, ``The Great Expectations of John Connally,'' by James
Reston Jr., son of The New York Times columnist. Excerpts of the
book were published in this week's Time magazine.
   Oswald's discharge was downgraded to undesirable, one step above
dishonorable, after he tried to sell military secrets to the Soviet
Union that he had acquired as a Marine Corps radar operator, Reston
wrote.
   Oswald lived in the Soviet Union for a time and at one point
attempted to renounce his U.S. citizenship.
   From the Soviet Union, Oswald wrote to Connally, who had been
Navy secretary, for help in having his military discharge upgraded,
Reston wrote.
   Oswald apparently did not know that six weeks earlier, Connally
had resigned his Navy position to re-enter Texas politics, and his
office sent Oswald a perfunctory reply, Reston wrote.
   ``Oswald had been spurned by a fellow Texan, and he resented
it,'' Reston wrote.
   Alexandra De Mohrenschildt, a member of the small Russian emigre
community in Fort Worth, told the Warren Commission, which
investigated the assassination of JFK, that Oswald had never
mentioned Kennedy.
   ``It was the governor of Texas (Connally) who was mentioned
mostly,'' Reston quoted De Mohrenschildt as saying. ``For some
reason Lee just didn't like him. ... Maybe it was the dishonorable
discharge.''
   Connally was riding in the car with Kennedy in Dallas on Nov. 22,
1963, and was seriously wounded in the shooting.
   Reston's book will be published this year by Edward Burlingame
Books@Harper & Row.

<HEAD>Report: American Hostage In Lebanon Tried And Failed To Escape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American hostage Alann Steen escaped from his
captors last year but was spotted and turned in by neighbors in the
Beirut suburb where he was being held, according to a published
report.
   Fellow hostage Mithileshwar Singh, who was freed in October, told
U.S. officials that the 49-year-old Steen was beaten by his captors
after his failed attempt to reach freedom, said a report in this
week's Newsweek magazine.
   Several fillings were knocked out of Steen's teeth during the
beating, Singh said.
   Steen, Singh, Jesse Turner and Robert Polhill, all teachers at
Beirut University College, were kidnapped from the campus in 1987.
   Singh told U.S. officials that he was treated better than the
Americans because he is a native of India, although he has U.S.
resident status.
   Singh said the four teachers were kept in Beirut, usually chained
and sometimes blindfolded, but were moved frequently because their
captors feared a U.S. rescue effort.
   All four had expected to be released around Election Day or the
presidential inaugural in January, Singh said.

<HEAD>Sununu Says Israeli Sovereignty Is Key to Mideast Peace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Sununu, the Arab-American whose appointment
as White House chief of staff upset some Jews, says the key to a
Middle East peace is ``to guarantee the integrity and strength of
Israel as a sovereign nation.''
   Sununu made the statement in an interview published today in the
Jerusalem Post, adding that he expected President-elect George Bush
and incoming Secretary of State James Baker to pursue peace in the
region.
   ``I think they're smart enough to know that it's in this
country's (U.S.) interest to deal with the tough issues and no one
can stay that it's not one of the great tough issues,'' he said,
referring to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   When asked if he had strong feelings about the Middle East
because of his Arab ancestry, he replied: ``I have feelings in this
sense: I think that ... as time has moved forward that we have
opportunities to move toward peace.''
   He told the Post it was ``in Israel's interest, the United
States' interest, frankly everyone's interest, to achieve peace and
tranquility in the Middle East.''
   ``For example,'' he said, ``for Israel's long-term economic
situation, peace would be a tremendous asset. ... To stay under the
constant tension that we seen is over the past few decades is not
good.''
   Noting that assuring Israel's sovereignty was the key to any
peace settlement, Sununu said: ``That has to be made clear.''
   Sununu, who is of Lebanese descent, aroused anger among some
Israeli and American Jews when as governor of New Hampshire he
refused to sign a petition calling for repeal of a United Nations
resolution equating Zionism with racism.
   He was the only American governor who did not sign the document,
saying at the time he believed it was not his business as a governor
to try to dictate foreign policy.
   In the interview with the Post, Sununu defended his record on
Israel, noting that he drafted the Middle East plank in the
Republican platform, which is regarded as pro-Israeli.
   Sununu confirmed he had been a member of the National Association
of Arab Americans, but said he was a third-generation American who
visited Lebanon only once, in 1949.

   Jillian's Billiard Club has 39 tournament pool
tables, no beer, no jukebox and a dress code. And the posh billiard
parlor is packed with the game's new upscale clientele.
   The club opened in July on the third floor of a former warehouse,
and similar clubs have been popping up in cities across the country.
   Patrons include men and women, most between 25 and 40, many on
dates. No betting is allowed, and a resident professional gives
lessons for $25 an hour.
   The tables are in spacious rows on a polished maple floor
surrounded by a brass railing and deep carpeting. Dark green
curtains hold back sunlight from arched windows.
   Many evenings, players must take numbers and cool their cues in
an adjoining cafe until a table opens. Corporate customers, mainly
brokerage firms and management consultants, have taken to renting a
back room and part of the main floor for private parties.
   Such success has not gone unnoticed.
   Manager and co-owner Kevin J. Troy said prospective pool hall
owners from other cities have been coming through Jillian's at a
rate of about one a week.
   Upscale pool halls have opened in New York, Miami and Dallas, and
others are planned in Los Angeles, and the Florida cities of Tampa
and Orlando, according to James J. Bakula, director of operations
for Brunswick Corp., the nation's largest pool table manufacturer.
   ``The old image of pool was that it was dangerous, there were
hustlers, dark rooms, grubbiness, people losing money, people
getting robbed,'' said Mark Cord, assistant director of the Billiard
Congress of America, a trade association in Iowa City, Iowa.
   ``But lately pool is associated more with something being classy.
There are these classy rooms opening up in the big cities, and there
is constantly magazine advertising using pool tables. You see a
slinky lady leaning up against a table, and a guy in a tuxedo,
advertising Ralph Lauren. The same thing with Christian Dior,
Jordache _ they've all done that.''
   Ron Blatt, whose family firm in New York City has made custom
pool tables since 1923, said pocket billiards was a gentleman's game
fancied by railroad magnates and oil tycoons from the 1890s until
the 1930s. But with its spread to neighborhood bars and bowling
alleys during and after World War II, it took on a tough-guy image.
   Blatt attributed the game's ``yuppie attraction'' both to the
Madison Avenue ad campaigns and to a 1986 movie, ``The Color of
Money,'' which starred Paul Newman and Tom Cruise as pool hotshots.
Newman won an Oscar for recreating ``Fast Eddie'' Felson, the
character he played in the 1961 movie, ``The Hustler.''
   Some think the upscale pool craze began in Japan two years ago,
after ``The Color of Money'' played there. Bakula said Brunswick has
shipped more than 1,000 tables to the Orient over the last two years.
   Brunswick doubled its annual production from 8,000 to 16,000
tables since 1986, he said, but still could not keep up with the
demand last year and had to turn away some Japanese orders.

<HEAD>Southern Florida Hub For Illegal Animal Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recent conviction of a ring charged with
smuggling exotic birds from Cuba provided a glimpse into the
lucrative enterprise of importing illegal animals, which has found a
base of operations in southern Florida.
   ``There is an insatiable appetite for animals of all kinds,''
said Thomas Quinn, one of nine special state wildlife agents in
Florida whose job includes stalking animal smuggling operations.
``If you have the money, you can get the animal. That's how it
goes.''
   Subtropical Florida, a hub for Latin American cargo flights, has
emerged as the nation's center for legitimate exotic animal import
firms, whose inventories range from darting fish to sluggish tree
sloths.
   But demand by high-paying customers tempts some of the companies
to forge inventories and try other schemes to bring in prohibited
animals as well.
   The smugglers, like the parrot ring, try to blend into the legal
animal traffic and hope to escape notice from inspectors, said Quinn.
   ``I've seen fake bottoms in crates, fake invoices, boxes marked
they are filled with venomous snakes to try to discourage
inspection. People will try just about anything to get these animals
in,'' said Quinn. ``I'm to the point now where nothing shocks me.''
   Officials estimate 36 companies and 300 individuals in southern
Florida are licensed by the state to deal in the international
animal trade. Many bring in several large shipments of fish, mammals
or reptiles each week, with only a handful of state and federal
inspectors to check the contents.
   ``We're overwhelmed,'' said Inspector Patrick Hyde of the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service in Miami. ``If we could check all the
shipments we would. The sheer volume of the animal traffic is just
too much.''
   Animals imports are regulated by state statutes and other laws
such as the Lacey Act, which bans interstate transportation of rare
species.
   Internationally, inspectors watch for violations of the
8-year-old Covenant on International Trade of Endangered Species, an
agreement signed by 120 nations that sets bans on some animals and
strict limits on others.
   But the more scarce an animal becomes, the more it's sought by
smugglers. Some exotic birds, such as the black-palmed cockatoo from
Southeast Asia, fetch up to $25,000 each. A Bengal tiger brings
between $10,000 and $15,000.
   ``We see a lot of these real expensive animals turn up in the
homes of the drug dealers down here,'' said Quinn. ``Among the
dopers, having these animals is a real status symbol.''
   Federal drug agents found a small zoo, including two cheetahs and
a leopard when they raided the Miami property of an alleged drug
trafficker last summer.
   ``Animals are affected by trends, just like fashion,'' said
Quinn. ``One time cobras were popular. Then it was black animals.
Then albino animals were hot. It comes in cycles.''
   Quinn's single best advantage is surprise. Unannounced, he combs
the warehouses around southern Florida and pokes into cages and fish
tanks.
   ``It's like going to a casino,'' he said. ``You never know when
you'll hit the jackpot.''

<TEXT>
   Three members of a ``skinhead'' gang have
been arrested and charged in what police say was a racially
motivated and unprovoked attack that killed a black man in front of
his home.
   Mulugetta Seraw, a 27-year-old Ethiopian immigrant, was kicked in
the head and beaten with a baseball bat by his assailants, and died
shortly after the Nov. 13 attack.
   The three men charged are members of East Side White Pride, the
state's largest skinhead gang, said Multnomah County District
Attorney Michael D. Schrunk.
   Witnesses said Seraw's attackers had shaven heads and wore green
military jackets with American flags on the sleeve.
   Kenneth Mieske, 23, whose alias is ``Ken Death,'' and Kyle
Brewster, 19, were being held without bond on murder charges pending
arraignments this afternoon, said homicide Detective Dave Simpson.
Steven Strasser, 20, was charged with second-degree assault and was
being held on $100,000 bail.
   Mieske was arrested early Saturday and the two others Sunday,
said authorities, who did not say how they tracked the three down.
   East Side White Pride has about 20 hard-core members, according
to a report last month from the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith, which monitors the activities of right-wing extremist
organizations.
   The skinhead subculture emerged in London as early as the 1960s.
Segments of the movement took on Nazi overtones in 1985 and since
have been supported by and associated with the white supremacist
Aryan Youth Movement and White Aryan Resistance.
   Mieske and Brewster face additional charges of first-degree
assault and racial intimidation in a Sept. 10 disturbance at a
grocery store on the city's southwest side, Simpson said.
   In that case, Carl Carlyle, 25, a black security guard, and
several store employees were drawn into a scuffle when they
attempted to eject a large number of ``skinheads,'' authorities said.
   It was during the Seraw investigation that police were able to
gather enough evidence to charge the pair in that case, Simpson said.
   A fourth person, who lived at the same address as Strasser, was
arrested on a fugitive warrant from Redwood City, Calif., Simpson
said.
   The warrant charged Michael C. Barrett, 20, with unlawful flight
to avoid prosecution and escape in the Nov. 14, 1987, vandalism of
Temple Beth Jacob.
   The synagogue had been spray-painted with racist slogans linked
to the Aryan Youth Movement, a California based neo-Nazi group that
is known to have been recruiting skinheads in the Portland area.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Bars Phila. From Cutting Aid to Retarded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has barred the city and state
from cutting off services to 9,000 retarded Philadelphians who live
at home, saying the ``irrational'' decision threatened the
recipients' health and safety.
   U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Broderick issued a permanent
injunction forbidding Philadelphia and the state from eliminating
vocational, family-support, early-intervention, recreational and
case-management services to mentally retarded people who live with
their families.
   In his ruling Thursday, the judge said that to deprive mentally
retarded people of services they need for living and working would
result in ``irreparable injury'' and ``cause serious regression to
many.'' He also said it would violate the equal-protection and
due-process clauses of the Constitution.
   The order will continue until further notice from the court, the
judge said.
   A projected $6.8 million shortage in state funds prompted the
city in June to announced plans to reduce or eliminate services for
mentally retarded Philadelphians who live at home and are registered
with the city for mental-retardation assistance. Services for
mentally retarded people in state-funded group homes were not
affected.
   The judge ruled that the city's decision affecting services to
the retarded living at home and not to those living in state-funded
residences was arbitrary.
   ``There has been a lack of judgment ... an irrational lack of
fairness. The Constitution demands that defendants should have found
a better way to resolve the problem,'' Broderick wrote.
   The judge did not say whether the city or state must fund the
services. He did note, however, that the city ``has contributed $3
million annually in excess of its 10 percent match.''
   State law requires the state to provide 90 percent of the funding
for such services and counties are to pay 10 percent and provide the
services themselves.
   In July, 32 people and the Philadelphia Police and Fire
Association for Handicapped Children Inc., filed a class-action
lawsuit against the city and state Department of Public Welfare
alleging that the city's mentally retarded were being denied their
rights to ``lifelong community support.''
   Broderick issued a temporary restraining order, effective Aug. 1,
that prohibited a cutback in services and later extended it until
last Friday.
   The attorney for the plaintiffs, David Ferleger, hailed the
ruling as ``a landmark.''
   ``No court has ever held that there is a guaranteed right to
community services for people with retardation living at home,''
Ferleger said.
   Deputy City Solicitor Guy Vilim said the city would review the
opinion before deciding how to proceed.

   U.S. military authorities are investigating reports
that two tear gas canisters exploded outside a nightclub near an
American base on Okinawa, a military spokesman said today.
   The incident was the latest in a series of mishaps to plague U.S.
military forces in this country.
   On Friday, the commander of a U.S. destroyer was relieved of his
post after practice shells from his ship reportedly missed hitting a
Japanese vessel by 330 yards. Japan lodged a protest over the Nov. 9
incident off Boso Peninsula east of Tokyo.
   Frederick H. Michaelis Jr. was relieved of command of the guided
missile destroyer USS Towers and transferred to Destroyer Squadron
15, military spokesman Rodriguez said.
   In October, rifle bullets struck a civilian housing area near a
firing range on Okinawa. Earlier this month, two Marine helicopters
collided in flight over the southern island, killing four servicemen.
   About 46,000 U.S. troops are stationed in the country under the
U.S.-Japan mutual security pact.
   No injuries or damages were reported in the latest incident in
Okinawa, Marine Master Gunnery Sgt. Jake Rodriguez said, but the
blasts sent scores of crying, choking people into the streets late
Saturday.
   Little else was known about the incident, Rodriguez added.
   ``Marine Corps officials acknowledged reports of an apparent
release of two CS gas (tear gas) devices in the vicinity of Club
Larosa, Chatancho,'' a statement from the U.S. military in Japan
said.
   The residential neighborhood in Chatancho borders the U.S. Kadena
Air Base.
   Military authorities and Japanese police were investigating
fragments from the exploded devices to determine their origin and
composition.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Convictions Gut Philadelphia-New Jersey Mob</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The convictions of mob boss Nicodemo ``Little
Nicky'' Scarfo and 16 associates have taken ``the guts out'' of a
deadly Philadelphia-southern New Jersey crime family, a prosecutor
says.
   A federal jury Saturday night convicted Scarfo, 59, and 16
associates in a racketeering conspiracy that included murder, drug
dealing, loan-sharking and illegal gambling.
   ``One of the things that this case did was it broke the myth of
the Mafia's invincibility,'' said assistant U.S. attorney Louis
Pichini.
   Pichini said the convictions crippled the crime family because of
the number of defendants involved and their high rankings in the
organization.
   ``With one conviction, we were able to take the guts out,''
Pichini said.
   Each defendant was found guilty on each of the two main
conspiracy counts they faced. In addition, some were found guilty on
other charges they faced individually.
   Sentencing was not immediately scheduled by U.S. District Judge
Franklin Van Antwerpen. All face possible sentences of from 40 to 55
years in prison. Scarfo is already in prison on an unrelated
conviction.
   Scarfo's attorney, Robert Simone, said he would appeal the
verdict, reached after 26 hours of jury deliberations.
   ``I think in terms of taking down the entire power structure of
the family, this is the first time that that has really occurred,''
said Joel Friedman, head of the U.S. Organized Crime Strike Force in
Philadelphia. ``What we've done here is really stopped them.''
   While other convicted mob leaders, such as the late Vito
Genovese, continued to rule during jail terms, law enforcement
officials said Scarfo doesn't have the clout, influence or savvy to
follow suit.
   ``I believe Scarfo's days as a leader in organized crime are
over,'' said Col. Clinton Pagano, superintendent of the New Jersey
State Police.
   However, Pichini and Friedman cautioned that the verdict doesn't
mean the end of organized crime in the area. Because Philadelphia
has been lucrative, New York-based mobsters may move in, Friedman
said.
   Scarfo is serving a 14-year prison term for conspiring to extort
$1 million from a Philadelphia developer. He and six others still
face conspiracy charges in Philadelphia in the 1985 gangland-style
slaying of mob associate Frank ``Frankie Flowers'' D'Alfonso.

and restoration, has unveiled one of Asia's great Buddhist centers
and an ancient royal capital from its ``Golden Age.''
   Peeling away centuries of jungle growth and soil, experts have
partially restored 193 Buddhist temples, moats, kiln sites and other
structures which 700 years ago were part of the powerful city of
Sukhothai.
   These form the 27-square-mile Sukhothai Historical Park, which
was formally opened although the public has had access to the area
for some time.
   Officiating at Sunday's opening ceremonies was Princess
Sirindhorn, a scholar of Thai culture and eldest daughter of King
Bhumibol Adulyadej, the latest in a royal line that Thais regard as
having begun in 1253 with the first king of Sukhothai.
   The bid to save Sukhothai from destructive vegetation and thieves
began in 1953 but stalled several years later. Work resumed in the
mid-1960s and received a boost in 1978 when the Thailand and the
U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization began a $10
million renovation plan.
   Sukhothai was included in UNESCO's campaign to restore 31 world
cultural sites.
   Its opening comes during heightened consciousness in Thailand
about the theft of its art treasures. Earlier this month, the Art
Institute of Chicago returned an ancient stone sculpture smuggled
out of the country to the United States in the 1960s.
   Decapitated statues and pilfered kiln sites at Sukhothai are
testimony to the loss of heritage, but a leading Thai art historian,
Prince Subhadradis Diskul, told reporters recently that what remains
within the guarded, well-attended park should be secure.
   However, other Thai experts have expressed concern that outlying
areas where archaeological work is under way are vulnerable to
antique hunters.
   Although UNESCO provided valuable expertise, the overall
restoration concept was worked out by Thais and involved the use of
non-original materials to flesh out temples and even the addition of
missing parts to giant statues of the Lord Buddha.
   Although a more ``purist'' approach is normally preferred in the
West, the Thais argued that the restoration should appeal to the
general public as well as to the Buddhist faithful who don't like to
worship before headless images.
   The Thai government _ which avidly promotes tourism _ also hopes
the restored monuments will attract more visitors. Officials say
about 500,000 Thais and foreigners are expected to visit this year.
   Some view the tourist boom as a danger to the tranquility and
natural beauty of the area. In the past, guidelines and regulations
on tourist development in Thailand have been violated by private
entrepreneurs.
   Beyond tourist revenue, officials say restoration of Sukhothai _
which translates as ``Dawn of Happiness'' _ is a national duty given
the city's central place in Thai history and culture.
   The kingdom lasted less than 150 years but shaped many aspects of
contemporary Thailand, including the Theravadda Buddhist religion.
Thai script, notions of kingship and relatively egalitarian social
relations were also developed.
   At its height the kingdom controlled an area stretching into
modern-day Laos, Burma and Malaysia. Its artists and architects
broke with the cultural dominance of Cambodia to create new styles,
especially in depicting the Buddha in bronze images.
   But internal strife eventually weakened Sukhothai, and power
shifted to the south and the kingdom of Ayuthaya in 1378. The
capital itself was abandoned in the 16th century.

<HEAD>Violence Leaves One Palestinian Dead; Moderates Call For Peace
Talks</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: To CORRECT gender of Siniora, SUBS grafs 5 and 13.

   Israeli troops shot to death a 22-year-old
Palestinian and wounded 11 others in clashes in the occupied lands,
and Arab and Israeli moderates claimed the protracted uprising has
increased prospects for peace.
   At a forum, six Israeli peace activists and Arab moderates on
Sunday praised the PLO parliament-in-exile's declaration of an
independent state as a message of peace and acceptance of Israel's
existence.
   ``The declaration ... was a reward to the Palestinian people who
have been struggling for 11 months and a message to the Israelis
that the Palestinian people accept a Jewish and Palestinian state
side-by-side,'' said Hanna Siniora, a pro-PLO newspaper editor from
east Jerusalem.
   Siniora said the revolt that pits rock-throwing Palestinian
youths against heavily armed soldiers ``made the Israeli people
realize that there were another people living under occupation
here.''
   Israeli leftists at the forum in Tel Aviv echoed his sentiments.
   ``The point is no longer who controls the land,'' said S. Izhar,
an Israeli author. ``The point is we can no longer sit on the heads
of 1.5 million Palestinians and rule their physical and political
lives. This occupation is destroying us.''
   Abie Nathan, a leading peace activist, said, ``I think the
chances for peace are better now than they ever were in the past.''
   ``It's time to realize that rocks and bullets won't accomplish
anything,'' Nathan said. ``I'm sure the Arabs will make more
concessions and then there will be pressure on (Prime Minister
Yitzhak) Shamir from the United States and American Jewry and he
will be forced to moderate his position.''
   On Sunday, the violence continued as one Palestinian was fatally
wounded during an army raid in the West Bank village of Baqa.
   Five Arabs were beaten during an Israeli army raid on the West
Bank village of Madama, Arab doctors said. Six others were wounded
by bullets in incidents in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
hospital officials reported.
   Sunday's death raised to 314 the number of Palestinians killed
since anti-Israel rioting began Dec. 8 in the territories Israel
seized in the 1967 Middle East war. Eleven Israelis have also died.
   Speaking in English to a largely Israeli audience in Tel Aviv,
Siniora, who has been mentioned as a Palestinian negotiator
acceptable to both Israelis and Palestinians, called on Israel to
end the violence by negotiating with the PLO.
   ``We are extending our hand with an olive branch to call to your
neighbors to take the first step toward peace with us,'' he said.
   Israeli peace activists also called on their government to begin
negotiations.
   ``The PLO pragmatism has come about despite Israel's hostility,''
said Matti Steinberg, a Middle East researcher at the Hebrew
University's Davis Institute. ``I hope their pragmatism will soon be
recognized in our community.''
   But in Jerusalem, Israel's Cabinet called the Palestine National
Council's declaration of an independent state in Israel's occupied
territories ``a jumble of illusions.''
   The government said the declaration could not contribute to peace
because the Palestine Liberation Organization's parliament had
neither renounced terrorism nor explicitly recognized Israel.
   ``The PLO was and remains the main obstacle for peace and all
those that support the PLO in this matter are hurting peace,'' an
official statement released after Sunday's cabinet meeting said.
   Elsewhere, an Israeli soldier was killed and four others injured
when their armored personnel carrier overturned in a road accident
Sunday in southern Lebanon, the army said.
   Israel radio said the accident occurred north of the Lebanese
city of Naqoura, two miles from the Israeli border.

<HEAD>Vatican Beatifies Mother Katharine Drexel, Philadelphia Nun</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II has beatified Mother
Katharine Drexel, praising the Philadelphia-born heiress-turned-nun
for devoting her life and fortune to fighting racism against blacks
and American Indians.
   About 10,000 people packed St. Peter's Basilica for Sunday's
ceremony in which the pope also beatified three Franciscan
missionaries stoned to death in Ethiopia in the early 18th century.
   In becoming ``blesseds'' of the Roman Catholic Church, the four
took a step toward possible sainthood.
   Mother Drexel, who was born in in 1858, became a nun in 1891 and
founded the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament to work among blacks
and Indians. She opened nearly 60 schools and missions, mostly in
the West and Southwest.
   A member of a prominent Philadelphia banking family, she gave an
estimated $20 million to further her order's work before her death
at age 96 in 1955.
   Mother Drexel ``seemed to grasp the fundamental truths which many
of her contemporaries failed to grasp; for example, the truth about
the equal dignity and worth of every human being, regardless of race
or ethnic origin,'' the pope said.
   ``In her day, American Indians and blacks in the United States
suffered great injustices as a result of racial prejudice,'' the
pope said in English. ``Seeing clearly the evil of this situation,
she set out with determination to combat and overcome it.''
   John Paul said Mother Drexel focused her efforts on establishing
Catholic schools.
   He noted that Mother Drexel came to Rome in 1887 to ask Pope Leo
XIII to send missionaries to her schools for Indians, and the
pontiff persuaded her to become a missionary herself.
   Mother Drexel established her first school in 1887: St. Catherine
Indian School in Santa Fe, N.M. She opened other schools in Wyoming,
Montana, California and Oregon.
   The order also set up a Catholic school system to serve blacks in
13 states, with 30 convents from Virginia to Louisiana. In 1925,
Mother Drexel founded Xavier University in New Orleans, the first
predominantly black Catholic university in the country.
   Archbishop Anthony J. Bevilacqua of Philadelphia said Mother
Drexel is remembered for ``her undaunted spirit of courageous
initiative in addressing social inequities among minorities _ 100
years before such concern aroused public interest in the United
States.''
   Among the more than 1,000 people who traveled from the United
States for the ceremony were Cardinal John Krol of Philadelphia;
Sister Juliana Haynes, president of the order; about 200 black
Catholics and dozens of American Indians.
   Also present were 22 distant cousins of Mother Drexel, including
three current trustees at Philadelphia's Drexel University, which
was founded by her uncle, banker Anthony Joseph Drexel, in 1891.
There are no survivors of her immediate family.
   The Vatican this year cleared the way for Mother Drexel's
beatification by approving a miracle attributed to her intercession.
Robert J. Gutherman, a Bucks County, Pa., teen-ager who lost hearing
in his right ear from an infection, reportedly regained hearing in
1974 after his parents prayed for Mother Drexel's intervention.
   To become a saint, the Vatican would have to confirm a second
miracle attributed to her intercession.
   The Franciscans beatified were German Liberato Weiss and Italians
Samuele Marzorati and Michele Pio Faoli. The three were martyred on
March 3, 1716, outside Gondar in Ethiopia.
   The three had been sent to Ethiopia to open ecumenical dialogue
with the Abyssinian church but were condemned for their religious
work and stoned to death.

<HEAD>Former President Carter Meets With Soviet Group On Housing Projects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLAINS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter and three
members of a Soviet volunteer organization have agreed to work
jointly on housing projects for the needy next summer in Washington
state and the Soviet Union.
   Carter met Sunday with the Soviet delegation at his home in
Plains. He is active in Habitat for Humanity, a group that builds
homes for the working poor.
   ``One of the things they (the Russians) wanted to do was housing
work for the benefit of low-income people with children, and Habitat
fit the bill,'' said Millard Fuller, Habitat's executive director,
who also attended the meeting with the Soviets.
   ``We decided that next summer a group of 10 Soviets will come to
Yakima and work with 10 Americans on the Habitat project there for
five or six weeks,'' Fuller said. ``Then the group will go to the
Soviet Union and work on a similar project there.''
   Habitat has conducted home-building projects in more than 300
U.S. cities as well as Canada, Australia and developing nations.
   The Soviets delagation are members of a private volunteer
organization, the Soviet Peace Fund, and were invited to the United
States by Ploughshares, a Seattle-based organization.
   The Soviet delegation included Svetlana Savitskaya, the first
woman cosmonaut to walk in space.
   ``It's very important to look at each other eye to eye,'' said
Ms. Savitskaya, who added that the project will help promote peace.
``This will help us to see there are not enemies among us but good
friends.''
   The project's ultimate goal is to have the Soviets and Americans
working side-by-side in developing nations, organizers said, but no
decision on that was reached.

   A man shot his estranged wife three times
while the couple argued in a church foyer, then killed himself with
a gunshot wound in the head, police said.
   The shooting occurred at 1 p.m. Sunday, just after morning
services ended at Wingfield Baptist Church, police said.
   William E. Mitchell Sr., 41, of Lynchburg died at Lynchburg
General Hospital about three hours later. His wife, Evelyn Mitchell,
41, was listed in serious but stable condition today with gunshot
wounds in the chest and stomach.
   Although the foyer was empty, a number of church members were in
the main hall and downstairs of the church. Police were questioning
parishioners to determine if anyone saw the shooting.
   Sherman Calloway was one of several people who heard it. He said
he went upstairs to find Mitchell slumped on the top few steps,
breathing but unconscious, and Mrs. Mitchell lying on the floor. A
small automatic pistol lay nearby.
   Lynchburg Police Cmdr. Earl M. Burnette said the Mitchells were
separated, but he did not know for how long.

   President Roh Tae-woo was quoted as
saying today he wants to resolve the controversy involving his
predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, and indicated the former leader would be
pardoned.
   Roh made the remarks as the 56-year-old Chun reportedly was
preparing to make a public apology for alleged corruption and other
misdeeds during his seven-year term in office.
   ``I will take actions under the principle that any wrongdoings by
a chief executive should be dealt with politically and that any
political reprisal would only hurt democratic development,'' the
Seoul Shinmun newspaper quoted Roh as saying.
   Chun had planned to leave Seoul Tuesday to live in seclusion in
the countryside, but the plan was delayed because of difficulty in
finding him a safe, rural home, news reports said.
   Chun is expected to apologize at a natioally televised news
conference Wednesday, newspapers quoted Chun's aides as saying. He
also is to turn over most of his wealth to the government and accept
rural exile, a traditional way of repentence for disgraced Korean
leaders.
   The former president, who stepped down in February, denies any
personal wrongdoing. But about a dozen of his relatives and
associates have been convicted or charged with corruption involving
millions of dollars in public funds.
   Dong-A-Ilbo newspaper said Chun would leave immmediately after
reading his statement Wednesday to live in a mountainside Buddhist
temple or near an army unit in the northern part of the country.
Chun, the paper said, needs a refuge where he will be safe from
attacks by radicals and other opponents.
   Other newspapers said he might move to the countryside in central
South Korea, but not to his hometown in the south, where residents
reportedly oppose his return.
   National Assembly hearings on abuses under the Chun government
focused today on attempts to stifle press freedom. More than 700
journalists were blacklisted and many newspaper and broadcast
operations were placed under state control by the Chun
administration.
   Chun has been a virtual prisoner in his luxurious Seoul house,
guarded by hundreds of riot police to prevent attacks by dissidents.
Opposition groups have held major protests and tried to march on his
home to demand his arrest.
   President Roh Tae-woo's government is under criticism for trying
to protect Chun and the government is trying to defuse public anger
without being implicated in the furor.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said the government was
considering a probe by prosecutors against Chun if his apology and
surrender of property does not satisfy the public.
   There have been increasing numbers of street protests urging
Chun's arrest in recent weeks. Over the weekend, thousands of
students and dissidents battled riot police in downtown Seoul after
police stopped a march to Chun's house.
   Chun, a former general, took power with military backing in 1980.
He was succeeded by Roh, another former general and a close Chun
associate.

<TEXT>
   A magistrate today dismissed a complaint
against two policemen by a Sikh convicted of assassinating former
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984, news reports said.
   Magistrate R.K. Gauba said Satwant Singh's complaint amounted
``to reopening the judgment in the Indira Gandhi murder case,'' said
United News of India.
   In a complaint filed Oct. 10, Satwant Singh said two members of
Mrs. Gandhi's security force fired at him after he was captured and
disarmed.
   He claimed he shot Mrs. Gandhi inadvertently in an attempt to
shoot down who he said were the real assassins _ the two policemen
who fired at him.
   Mrs. Gandhi was gunned down Oct. 31, 1984, in the garden of her
official residence by Satwant Singh and a fellow Sikh bodyguard,
Beant Singh.
   In resulting shooting, Satwant Singh was severely injured and
Beant Singh was killed. The two men were not related.
   After an eight-month trial in 1986, Satwant Singh was convicted
of murdering Mrs. Gandhi and sentenced to death.
   Beant Singh's maternal uncle, Kehar Singh, was convicted of
conspiring with the assassins and also got the death penalty.
   ``It is most unnatural that Satwant would have hidden truth of
this nature throughout the trial of a case where his own life was at
stake,'' Gauba said, according to United News of India.
   Singh's lawyer, Rupinder S. Sodhi, said he would appeal.
   Mrs. Gandhi apparently was shot and killed in retaliation for an
army raid she ordered in June 1984 on the Golden Temple, the Sikhs'
holiest shrine. It was used as a base by militant Sikhs fighting for
an independent homeland in the Punjab. At least 1,200 people, mostly
Sikhs, died in the assault.
   Militant Sikhs have waged a bloody guerrilla war since 1982. They
claim they are discriminated against by the majority Hindus.
   Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of India's population but are
in a slight majority in Punjab.

<HEAD>Minister Says Rebel Leader Denies Ordering Plane Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A southern rebel leader denied ordering
missile attacks on aircraft, including one that damaged a plane
carrying many of Sudan's military heirarchy, a government minister
said today.
   The plane carried 60 people, including Defense Minister
Abdul-Maguid Khalil.
   Osman Omer, minister for construction and public works, said
rebel commander John Garang said he has held off ordering his Sudan
People's Liberation Army to escalate the war, even though a
tentative new agreement to end 5{ years of civil war has not been
implemented.
   Omer said Garang made the statements in a telephone conversation
Sunday with his negotiating partner, Mohamed Osman Mirghani.
   On Sunday, military spokesman Brig. Mohamed Osman Malik blamed
the incident on Garang's rebels. After Malik's comments, Prime
Minister Sadek Mahdi said the incident proved Garang has ``lost
credibility. The rebel movement is not serious about its peace
claims.''
   Mirghani is patriarch of the Democratic Unionist Party, a junior
partner in Sudan's governing coalition. Omer said Prime Minister
Sadek Mahdi was with Mirghani when Garang told him he gave no orders
for ``shooting this plane or any other plane.'' Garang spoke from
his headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   Last Thursday, unidentified men fired a SAM-7 missile at a
Hercules C-130 just after it took off from the besieged city of Wau
in southern Sudan with the defense minister, the army
commander-in-chief and other top military commanders aboard.
   The missile badly damaged the plane's engine and control system.
But the pilot managed to maintain control and landed without injury
or other damage.
   Rebel broadcasts from Ethiopia took responsibility for the
shooting down of two civilian aircraft in southern Sudan in 1986 and
1987 that killed more than 70 people. The first, in August 1986,
prompted Mahdi to cease contacts with rebel leaders that had held
early promise of agreement.
   The incident came a day after an initial cease-fire agreement was
signed in Addis Ababa between Garang and Mirghani.
   Mahdi and other political leaders have endorsed the peace
initiative, although the prime minister has not discussed the issue
publicly since the shooting.
   Garang took up arms in 1983 in a quest for autonomy and economic,
administrative and social reforms in southern Sudan. Its Christian
and animist African-descended people traditionally have been
dominated by the ethnic Arab Moslems of the north.

   Emperor Hirohito lay in stable condition today at
the Imperial Palace, more than two months after he was bedridden
with internal bleeding, a spokesman said.
   The 87-year-old monarch slept most of the day, said Kenji Maeda,
spokesman for the Imperial Household Agency.
   He said Hirohito's temperature in the evening was 99.68 degrees,
up from his normal reading of about 95.9.
   Since he feel ill Sept. 19, Hirohito has been bleeding
intermittently from the upper intestine, which underwent a bypass
operation in September 1987. But Maeda said the emperor has shown no
signs of new bleeding for almost two weeks. Hirohito has received
transfusions of about 42 pints of blood since he became ill _ more
than three times the amount circulating in his body.
   According to news reports, Hirohito's weight has fallen to 66
pounds from the 110 pounds he weighed before his illness.
   Hirohito, who is being fed intravenously, also suffers from
jaundice and anemia.
   Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny reports that the
world's longest-reigning monarch has pancreatic cancer.

   An Air Force reservist died
after a window burst on a KC-135 tanker aircraft flying over the
Atlantic Ocean and the cockpit depressurized, officials said.
   Master Sgt. James L. Borland, 47, of Moreno Valley was killed in
the accident as the plane was en route from England, said Capt.
Richard Williamson, a spokesman for the air wing. The precise cause
of death was not immediately determined, officials said.
   He died when a 10-inch-by-8-inch sextant sighting window in the
cockpit broke, officials said. A flight surgeon among the 17 others
aboard the aircraft tended to Borland. None of the others was
injured, Williamson said.
   The accident, four to five hours into the flight from Lakenheath,
England, was ``one of those bizarre things. The odds are one in 2
billion,'' said Lt. Col. Duncan Bridewell.
   Col. Tom Frank, the aircraft's commander, said he heard a sharp
bang as the plane flew at 35,000 feet above the ocean and miles from
land. The crew landed the plane about 400 miles away at Iqaluit, on
Baffin Island, 1,500 miles north of Montreal off the coast of Canada.
   The tanker, a military version of the Boeing 707, was on a
weeklong refueling mission in support of Air Force fighter aircraft.
   An Air Force board of inquiry was sent to Iqaluit to investigate.

<HEAD>Judge Lets Stand $700,000 Verdict Against Newspapers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has refused to set aside a $700,000
award against two newspapers, saying they committed ``calculated
misdeeds'' when they published a source's name after promising him
confidentiality.
   Officials of the Star Tribune of Minneapolis and the St. Paul
Pioneer Press Dispatch, the state's largest papers, said they were
not surprised by Saturday's ruling and would appeal.
   The case concerns a suit filed by Dan Cohen, who claimed during
trial in July that he lost his advertising job after the newspapers
misrepresented and breached an oral contract they made to keep his
name out of a politically sensitive story.
   Cohen had leaked court documents to reporters during the 1982
gubernatorial campaign that revealed that Marlene Johnson, a
candidate for lieutenant governor, had been arrested for shoplifting
several years earlier.
   Cohen, who worked for rival gubernatorial candidate Wheelock
Whitney, provided the information on the condition that he not be
identified as the source.
   Editors at the newspapers testified that they overruled their
reporters' promises of anonymity because the public had the right to
know the information came from the Whitney campaign.
   But Hennepin County District Judge Franklin Knoll ruled that the
First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of the press did not shield
the newspapers against Cohen's breach of contract claim.
   ``The courts have made it clear that no First Amendment interest
exists in protecting news media from calculated misdeeds,' ''
Knoll's memorandum said. ``Certainly, the knowing and willful breach
of a legally sufficient contract after hours of thought and
discussion by corporate officers can fairly be characterized as a
calculated misdeed.' ''
   Knoll also dismissed the newspapers' argument that a relationship
between a reporter and a source is anything other than commercial.
   ``The advertising war currently being waged by one (newspaper)
against the other is ample evidence of the profit motive underlying
their operations,'' he said.
   ``It's our intent to appeal,'' said John T. Henry, publisher of
the Pioneer Press Dispatch. ``We were hoping for a different
outcome, but this was not unanticipated.''
   Tim J. McGuire, managing editor of the Star Tribune, said his
newspaper also will appeal the decision to the Minnesota Court of
Appeals.

   Three people were killed and at least nine
wounded in gang violence over the weekend, and California Highway
Patrol officers were on alert after receiving a death threat by a
professed gang member.
   A man was fatally shot Sunday night by reputed gang members as he
rode in the back of a pickup truck on a residential street in
Pacoima in the San Fernando Valley, authorities said.
   The unidentified victim, believed to be 18 to 20 years old, died
at a hospital shortly after the attack, said Sgt. Al Yarbrough.
   On Saturday, two men shouting gang slogans opened fire on a lone
victim in Compton, south of Los Angeles, killing him, and a
15-year-old gang member allegedly shot a 16-year-old rival to death
in Los Angeles.
   Highway patrol officers, meanwhile, remained on alert after a man
identifying himself as a member of the Crips gang called patrol
headquarters Friday and threatened to kill five officers a day.
   No attacks against highway patrol officers were reported by
Sunday night.
   Those wounded over the weekend included a 14-year-old boy shot
between the eyes early Sunday in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles;
and five people injured hit by shots from a passing van Saturday as
they stood outside a wedding reception in suburban Inglewood. Police
said the had no motive for that attack, which they described as
gang-style.

   Here is a sketch of Education Secretary Lauro
F. Cavazos, who has been asked to retain that post in George Bush's
administration:
   AGE: 61.
   EDUCATION: He earned a bachelor's degree in zoology and a
master's degree in cytology at Texas Tech before getting a doctorate
in physiology from Iowa State University in 1954.
   JOB HISTORY AND BACKGROUND: Cavazos first taught as an instructor
of anatomy, and later as an associate professor, at the Medical
College of Virginia in Richmond. Later, he was dean of the school of
medicine at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., before becoming in
1980 the first alumnus of Texas Tech to be named president. At Texas
Tech, he paid special attention to minority education, and during
his tenure Hispanic enrollment increased. He received the National
Hispanic Leadership award of the League of United Latin American
Citizens in July for his efforts to reduce the dropout rate among
Hispanic youth.
   Cavazos announced in May that he would resign as president in
July 1989 and after a leave return to teach anatomy in the medical
school, where he has tenure. In September, he succeeded William J.
Bennett as education secretary.
   A Democrat, Cavazos publicly disagreed with the Reagan
administration's cuts in student loan programs.

   The coroner's report on Christina
Onassis' death says the Greek heiress died of natural causes, the
newspaper La Nacion reported today.
   The 37-year-old daughter of Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle
Onassis died Saturday of an apparent heart attack at the country
club home of friends. Autopsy results on the cause of death are
expected to be released today.
   The coroner's report is key to the release of the body for burial
in Greece, and might provide details of Miss Onassis' death. The
report was to be delivered today to Buenos Aires Judge Fernando Nino.
   In another development, three jars of medicine and other evidence
found in Miss Onassis' bedroom were taken by police Sunday for
analysis, the private news agency Diarios y Noticias said today.
Another bottle of pills reportedly was missing.
   One of three doctors who allegedly examined Miss Onassis at the
country club and pronounced her dead there was questioned by police
and two judges who have jurisdiction in the case, DyN reported.
   Miss Onassis frequently dieted to combat an obesity problem and
was known to take diet pills. It was not known if she was on diet
pills at the time of her death.
   Judge Nino tentatively ruled the death suspicious because the
body arrived dead at the hospital. The coroner's report he ordered
is based on an autopsy conducted Saturday night.
   A federal judge on Sunday night prohibited the removal of Miss
Onassis' body from Argentina without his authorization, citing
procedural errors in transfering the body from his district to
Buenos Aires.
   Miss Onassis was the stepdaughter of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,
the widow of President John F. Kennedy who married Aristotle Onassis
in 1968.
   In Piraeus, Greece, a spokesman for the family's Springfield
Shipping company said Miss Onassis will be buried on her family's
island, Skorpios, off northwest Greece later this week.
   The spokesman said the Onassis fortune had been left to the
daughter born in 1985 to Miss Onassis and her fourth husband,
Thierry Roussel.
   ``The entire fortune goes to little Athena,'' the spokesman said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Mr. Roussel will have custody
of the child until she comes of age.''
   Miss Onassis, who made headlines with her jet-setting lifestyle
and four marriages, all of which ended in divorce, married Roussel
in March 1984 and filed for divorce eight months later.
   Half of the estimated $1 billion family fortune went to Miss
Onassis upon her father's death in 1975. The other half is
controlled by the Alexander Onassis Foundation, which was set up in
memory of Onassis' only son, Alexander, who died in a 1973 plane
crash.
   Miss Onassis was visiting the country home of Marina and Alberto
Dodero 25 miles northwest of Buenos Aires when she was stricken.
   She was taken to a first-aid station at the club, then to a
Buenos Aires hospital, where she was pronounced dead of an apparent
heart attack, said hospital director Hernan Bunge.
   Federal Judge Alberto Piotti was quoted as telling Diarios y
Noticias that he issued the order Sunday night prohibiting the
departure of the body from Argentina.
   Piotti said the transportation of the body from the country club
to the Buenos Aires hospital involved ``errors of procedure, perhaps
involuntary'' by medical personnel, the news agency said.
   No further details were immediately available.
   The body was at the Greek Orthodox Church in Buenos Aires, where
a private funeral Mass was held Sunday.

   Here is a sketch of Attorney General Richard L.
Thornburgh, who has been asked to keep that post in George Bush's
administration:
   AGE: 56.
   EDUCATION: He earned a civil engineering degree from Yale
University, and a law degree from the University of Pittsburgh Law
School.
   JOB HISTORY AND BACKGROUND: Thornburgh was appointed U.S.
attorney for western Pennsylvania in 1969. In 1975, he was appointed
by President Ford as assistant attorney general in charge of the
Justice Department's criminal division.
   In 1978, he defeated former Pittsburgh Mayor Pete Flaherty for
governor, running on a platform of cleaning up corruption in the
Democratic administration of then-Gov. Milton Shapp, a Democrat. He
was re-elected in 1982, narrowly defeating former congressman Allen
Ertel. Barred by law from seeking a third term, Thornburgh left
Pennsylvania at the end of 1986 to head the Institute of Politics at
Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. In August,
Thornburgh replaced Attorney General Edwin Meese III, who resigned
after saying he had been vindicated by an independent counsel
investigation of his affairs.
   After becoming attorney general, Thornburgh made a speech on
ethics at the Justice Department that was widely perceived as being
indirect criticism of Meese, who had been under criminal
investigation for 14 months during his 3{-year tenure. Thornburgh,
who later denied that his remarks had anything to do with the Meese
tenure, called for a review of Justice Department ethics policies.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of oil workers
today began returning to work after a 10-day nationwide walkout, the
state oil monopoly Petrobras and strike leaders said.
   Local unions voted Sunday night to accept a government offer of
wage increases, Petrobras press officer Lucio Pimentel said Monday.
   Mauro Costa of the national strike command in Brasilia, the
capital, said some unions still were voting on the proposal, but
``the tendency is to accept the offer.''
   ``It was a great political victory, although economically it
didn't attain what we wanted,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   The strike by more than 50,000 petroleum workers paralyzed the
nation's 11 refineries and caused severe shortages of cooking gas
and diesel fuel.
   In weekend emergency meetings, the government offered strikers a
15 percent cost-of-living raise retroactive to June 1987 and 4
percent more for productivity.
   Petrobras agreed not to punish strikers and to discount only four
days from their paychecks.
   Strike leaders urged unions to accept the offer, although it fell
short of the 26.6 percent increase they were demanding.
   The government suspended cost-of-living raises last year, saying
they fuel inflation now running at more than 1,000 percent a year.
   Oil workers earn an average $300 a month _ good wages by
Brazilian standards.
   The strike forced the government to import emergency shipments of
diesel fuel, cooking gas and kerosene. Gas rationing was imposed in
some parts of the country.
   Brazilian refineries can produce 1.5 million barrels of petroleum
by-products a day. The country consumes about 1.1 million barrels of
oil daily, of which nearly 50 percent is imported.

   Here is a sketch of Richard Darman, chosen by
President-elect George Bush as director of the Office of Management
and Budget.
   AGE: 45.
   EDUCATION: He received an undergraduate degree from Harvard in
1964 and an M.B.A. from the Harvard School of Business three years
later.
   JOB HISTORY AND BACKGROUND: From 1970 to 1977, Darman served in
the Nixon and Ford administrations in policy positions in the
departments of Defense, Justice, Commerce, State and Health,
Education and Welfare. He also was a member of the faculty of
Harvard's Graduate School of Government and a partner of ICF Inc., a
management and economic consulting company.
   He entered the Reagan administration in 1981 as a top aide to
James A. Baker III, then White House chief of staff. He followed
Baker to the Treasury Department when Baker switched jobs in 1985
with former Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan. Darman was a key
architect of the administration's policy to join with America's
major trading partners in late 1985 to drive the value of the dollar
lower as a way of solving the country's huge trade deficit.
   He resigned as deputy Treasury secretary, the No. 2 post, in
April 1987 to take a job with Shearson Lehman Brothers investment
banking division at a salary, with stock options, reportedly
approaching $1 million annually.
   Over the summer, Darman joined the Bush campaign. He served as
the stand-in for Democrat Michael Dukakis during Bush's practice
sessions for his two debates.

   An American hostage in the 1985
TWA hijacking fought back tears today while testifying he feared his
son-in-law would be shot during the ordeal.
   Also at the trial, a defense attorney said confessed hijacker
Mohammed Ali Hamadi was ``mentally disturbed'' during the crime and
asked that his client be given a psychiatric examination.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is accused of air piracy and
murder in the June 1985 hijacking. U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem
was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days.
   Vincente Garza, a real estate developer, testified that his
son-in-law, Robert Trautmann, was among several hostages taken off
the plane at Beirut Airport and then hidden in the city before the
ordeal was over.
   Garza, 57, said he offered to take Trautmann's place.
   ``I thought he could be ... shot, and I asked Hamadi `don't take
him away, take me.' Hamadi just pushed me back and told me to sit
down,'' Garza testified, choking back his emotions and seeming on
the verge of crying.
   Garza said Hamadi also took part in robbing passengers.
   Earlier today, defense attorney Hans-Burkhardt Steck asked that a
psychiatrist examine Hamadi. He said he has evidence from a
psychiatrist that Hamadi had been ``hindered in his development''
because of injuries he sustained in war-torn Beirut.
   Another American testified that she feared the hijackers would
deal with her severely because she was Jewish.
   ``I was very afraid because I am Jewish and I didn't know if they
knew it,'' Mauri Schwarz, a 36-year-old computer saleswoman, told
the court. ``I heard screams and beatings on more than one
occasion.''
   Ms. Schwarz said one of the passengers sitting near her had asked
for medical help because he had a heart condition ``but the
hijackers refused.''
   Following Ms. Schwarz' testimony, Hamadi was asked to comment.
   ``I never took part in the robberies and if anyone had asked me
for a doctor, I would have done that,'' he said.
   Under court guidelines to protect witnesses, former hostages do
not reveal their hometowns.
   They have testified about savage beatings and the death of
Stethem, who was shot and thrown out onto the tarmac in Beirut.
   Hamadi admits being one of the hijackers, but denies shooting
Stethem.
   He was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in January 1987 after custom
officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.
   The United States requested Hamadi's extradition last year, but
the West German government turned it down, fearing for the lives of
two West Germans held hostage in Lebanon. The hostages since have
been released.
   Hamadi's older brother, Abbas, is serving a 13-year prison term
in West Germany in connection with the kidnappings.

   Populist leader Benazir Bhutto met
with the leader of an ethnic Indian immigrant party today to try to
forge an alliance that would make her the first woman prime minister
of an Islamic country.
   The Pakistan People's Party, led by Ms. Bhutto, captured the
largest bloc of votes in Wednesday's national election but fell
short of a majority in the National Assembly.
   Ms. Bhutto, who has said she expects to be the country's new
prime minister, is seeking the support of elected independent and
smaller parties to form a governing majority.
   She met today with Altaf Hussain, leader of the Mohajir Quami
Movement, which came in third in the election and represents ethnic
Indian Moslem immigrants.
   Wasim Sajjad, minister for justice and parliamentary affairs,
announced today that President Ghulam Ishaq Khan intends to persuade
Ms. Bhutto and her conservative rival Nawaz Sharif to unite in a
coalition government. Sajjad said Khan will meet separately with the
two leaders Tuesday.
   A government spokesman, who requested anonymity, said ``the
discussion with the two major party leaders will be to form a
broad-based government. It's only natural.''
   But Ms. Bhutto said she will not accept a coalition with Sharif,
whose Islamic Democratic Alliance was second in the election,
officials said.
   Last week's vote, the first free elections in Pakistan since
1977, had no majority winner.
   Ms. Bhutto's party won 93 seats in the 237-member National
Assembly, compared to 55 for the right-wing Islamic Democratic
Alliance led by Sharif. The remaining 68 seats contested went to
independents, minor parties and non-Moslem candidates.
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, says she has enough recruits among newly elected
members of the National Assembly to command a majority in the
chamber, and expects the president to ask her party to form the new
government.
   In voting for provincial assembly seats on Saturday, Ms. Bhutto's
party was only able to obtain an outright majority in one of the
country's four provinces.
   She virtually swept her home province of Sind in southern
Pakistan. But in the heavily populated Punjab province, where 60
percent of the country's 107 million people live, the majority went
to the right-wing alliance.
   In Pakistan, the Senate, National Assembly and the four
provincial assemblies elect the president, who is head of state. The
president, in turn, has the power to name the prime minister.
   However, the Constitution has two clauses on naming a prime
minister.
   One gives the president discretion both in timing and selection
of a prime minister. The other, originally meant to apply to
elections held after 1990, requires the new legislature to convene
first and the person with the majority of votes to head the
government.
   Ms. Bhutto maintains that the 1990 provision applies to the
current situation. Pakistan's military leader, Gen. Mohammed Zia
ul-Haq, had added the 1990 provision to the Constitution after
deciding he would continue as president with the powers to decide
prime minister until 1990.
   Zia died in a plane crash Aug. 17, just weeks after calling
national elections. Zia ousted Bhutto's father, former Prime
Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in a bloodless 1977 coup and had
Bhutto executed two years later.

<TEXT>
   An inmate convicted of two murders and
sentenced to two life terms escaped from a 153-year-old section of
the Trenton state prison early this morning after burrowing out of
his cell and using a handmade ladder to scale an outer wall,
officials said.
   Gonzalo Marrero, who would have to serve at least 60 years before
being considered for parole, was spotted scaling the 20-foot outer
wall of the prison at 4 a.m. today by a tower guard, said Jim
Stabile, spokesman for the state Department of Corrections.
   Stabile said Marrero, 37, jumped over the wall after the guard
called out at him. Two other inmates who had also escaped from the
cell _ Jorge LaBrada and Andrew Bisesi, both 28 _ did not try to
escape after they heard the guard, he said.
   The three were cellmates in the prison's oldest section, which
opened in 1835, and burrowed through a 3-foot-thick wall to escape.
They squeezed through a narrow opening into the prison compound, and
then Marrero used a 19-foot ladder fashioned from wood scraps to
scale the outer wall, Stabile said.
   Marrero apparently cut himself on razor wire on the top of the
outer wall because blood was found on the ladder and outside the
wall, the spokesman said.
   Stabile said it was not immediately known how the three cut
through their cell wall or where they found the wood to build the
ladder. He said LaBrada and Bisesi were being questioned this
morning.
   Corrections officials and local authorities were conducting a
wide search of Trenton this morning.
   Tracking dogs following a partial trail of blood believed left by
Marrero led authorities to a drainage system along Route 29, and
authorities believed Marrero was in the area, said Robert Vasquez,
head of special operations groups for the corrections department.
   Helicopters traveled up and down the river as authorities opened
manholes and rifle-toting officers stood guard at streets closed off
in the area, a densely populated blue-collar neighborhood of
rowhouses.
   Marrero, sent to the prison in 1986, also was convicted of
robbery, sexual assault and burglary.

<HEAD>Task Force Gives University Until Dec. 5 To Revise Smoking Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State legislators are asking University of
Louisville officials to reconsider banning smoking in some parts of
the campus, and are threatening to cut the school's budget if they
don't.
   The General Assembly's Tobacco Task Force, meeting Sunday, gave
the state university until Dec. 5 to change its proposed campus
smoking policy. Kentucky is the nation's leading tobacco grower.
   If the university doesn't back down, ``It'll open up the
awfullest can of worms,'' said the Rep. Clay Crupper, chairman of
the House Agriculture Committee.
   Crupper said the legislature has the ultimate weapon: the budget.
   The proposed policy _ disclosed last week and scheduled to take
effect by the new year _ would prohibit smoking in common areas such
as stairwells, hallways and reception areas. Cafeterias would be
divided into smoking and non-smoking areas.
   Dan Hall, a university administrator, told the legislators that
the university is willing to ``rethink this provision and maybe have
something more balanced.''
   ``I'll take back to campus tomorrow what you've said,'' Hall
said. ``I hear you loud and clear.''
   He also said, ``The policy is not meant to be anti-tobacco or
anti-smoking but to better balance the rights of smokers and
non-smokers on our campus.''
   If the university doesn't back down, other committees _ including
those dealing with agriculture, small businesses, and labor and
industry _ will take up the cause, Crupper said.
   Crupper initially called on the task force to approve a
resolution asking the university to back down. But he later agreed
to give the university until the task force's Dec. 5 meeting to
revise its policy.
   The provision of the policy that most offended legislators Sunday
night was a clause that resolves otherwise irreconcilable conflicts
between smokers and non-smokers in favor of the non-smoker.
   Crupper said that if a restrictive policy is enacted at the
University of Louisville, it would spread to other state
universities.
   Sen. Fred Bradley said, ``I'm concerned with the precedent it
would set and the impression it would give people.''
   The state's total income from tobacco production in 1984 was $2.3
billion, and that led to $126 million in taxes, according to
task-force Chairman Rep. Donnie Gedling.

<HEAD>News Director Wins Arbitration Fight Over Sexual Jokes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radio news director who walked off the job
after being subjected to on-air sexual jokes by two disc jockeys has
won $8,000 in severance pay.
   Arbitrator Ronald F. Talarico said various sex-related jokes made
on WBZZ-FM about newscaster Liz Randolph ``were lewd, offensive,
sophomoric, in bad taste and beyond anything that an employee should
have to be subjected to _ even if they are part of an `entertainment
vehicle.'''
   Ms. Randolph walked off the Jan. 22 morning show of Jim Quinn and
``Banana'' Don Jefferson after a joke of a sexual nature was aired
about her.
   The station fired her and refused to give her severance pay,
saying her walk-off constituted a ``flagrant neglect of duty'' in
violation of WBZZ's collective bargaining agreement with the
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
   In voluntary arbitration between the federation and WBZZ's owner,
EZ Communications Inc., Talarico said the station could not deny Ms.
Randolph the severance pay. The written opinion was received by Ms.
Randolph's attorney last week.
   Talarico ordered the station to pay her 10 weeks' salary, plus
interest. Station Manager Tex Meyer estimated the award at $8,000.
Meyer said the station planned to appeal.
   Talarico agreed with WBZZ that Ms. Randolph knew her job would
require her to be involved in ``banter and interplay'' with other
on-air employees, some of which might be risque.
   But, he wrote, Ms. Randolph's participation in earlier jokes did
not prevent her from objecting to the ``vile and filthy'' Jan. 22
joke.
   ``Obviously, we're pleased with the decision,'' said Samuel
Kamin, Ms. Randolph's attorney. But Meyer said he was surprised by
the decision, because ``the arbitrator determined Liz Randolph
willingly participated in humorous banter.''
   A civil suit filed by Ms. Randolph against the station, EZ
Communications, Quinn, Jefferson, Meyer and former program director
Jim Richards is pending.

   Israel's 12th parliament today opened on a
fractious note as 15 leftist legislators refused to be sworn in by a
lawmaker whose party calls for expelling Arabs from Israel.
   Yair Sprintzak, 77, of the right-wing Moledet (Homeland) party,
administered the oaths under a law that makes the oldest member of
the Knesset, or parliament, its acting speaker until a permanent
speaker is chosen.
   A new speaker was chosen after the swearing-in ceremony. He is
Dov Shilansky of the rightist Likud bloc.
   Moledet, which won two seats in the Nov. 1 elections, calls for
the ``voluntary transfer'' of Palestinians from Israel's occupied
territories.
   Before swearing in the new legislators, Sprintzak delivered a
highly political speech in which he called for a Greater Israel, a
concept under which the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip would
become part of Israel.
   More than a dozen left-wing legislators, shouting words of
protest, got up from their seats and walked to the back of the hall.
They returned when Sprintzak called the names of each Knesset
member, but then 15 members refused to take the required oath.
   ``We will not be sworn in by a transferist who represents for us
the complete opposite of law, morality and justice, Jewish and
human, for which we were elected,'' said Ran Cohen of the leftist
Citizens Rights Movement.
   Five members of his faction were among those refusing to be sworn
in by Sprintzak. Others included Avraham Burg of the left-leaning
Labor Party.
   New parliament members cannot participate in proceedings until
they take the oath, said parliament spokeswoman Sarah Yitzhaki.
   Moledet's platform calls for bringing about the ``voluntary
transfer'' of 1.5 million Palestinians from the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip through government policies that would deny Arabs
employment and other services.
   Sprintzak has been quoting as saying he is not a racist and
advocates the transfer as the most humane solution to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
   The election of Shilansky as new parliament speaker was also
controversial. Shilansky has said he will refuse to meet with a
German delegation if elected.
   ``I, Dov Shilansky, am a Holocaust survivor and I have to be
loyal to my brothers ... I will not shake a German's hand. Even if I
wanted to I could not do it,'' he said.
   The 64-year-old Lithuanian-born Shilansky was sentenced to 21
months in jail in 1952 for carrying explosives during a
demonstration against Israel's reparation talks with West Germany.
He was released after 16 months in jail.

   Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas
called for an investigation into the deaths of three farm workers
killed during last week's meeting of the Organization of American
States.
   Rivera Damas said Sunday that in addition to the three deaths in
the eastern province of Morazan, 20 people were killed in combat
during the conference in San Salvador.
   The prelate gave no details of the civilian slayings, which had
not been reported previously.
   ``The information available involved national army troops in this
action and we consider a detailed investigation necessary,'' the
archbishop said in his homily.
   ``We believe acts of this type make the public react negatively
against whomever uses that method, whether it be the armed forces or
(the guerrillas),'' he said.
   The five leftist guerrilla groups, which have been fighting for
nine years to overthrow the U.S.-backed government, declared a
temporary truce during the six-day OAS meeting that ended Saturday.
   
   Rivera Damas said the meeting of the Washington-based
organization left ``an atmosphere of hope'' for peace.
   It ``has meant, in a way, a certain possibility of support in
that it could stimulate a political solution to our conflict,'' the
church leader said.
   More than 15,000 people from churches and labor organizations
marched through the main streets of the capital on Nov. 15 to urge
rebel and government representatives to hold new peace talks.
   ``This is reason for joy for those of us who believe in the
possibility of promoting peace through non-violent actions,'' he
said.
   The church mediated the few meetings between the two sides in
recent years, the latest on Oct. 20, 1987 in San Salvador, and has
been critical of killings of civilians by both the left and the
right.
   An estimated 65,000 people have died in the war, the majority of
them civilians.

   President-elect George Bush announced today he
will retain Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, saying the Justice
Department chief has ``a record of unquestioned integrity and a
commitment to upholding the highest ethical standards.''
   At a news conference, Bush said he is appointing Thornburgh
because ``I know that he will work with me to fight drugs with every
tool at our disposal'' and on other issues as well, including
attacking crime ``at every level'' and defending the civil rights of
all Americans.
   Since election day Nov. 8, a number of other names had emanated
from the Bush camp as possible replacements for Thornburgh.
   In a brief interview at the Justice Department, Thornburgh said
that he had learned of Bush's decision to retain him at a weekend
meeting initiated by the president-elect and that ``I was extremely
pleased and gratified that he made this appointment.''
   Bush's decision ``gives me the opportunity to continue what I
hope will be a positive and productive course for the department,''
Thornburgh said in the interview. ``My priorities will be the
president-elect's priorities.''
   In addition to fighting drugs, Thornburgh said ``our efforts in
... white-collar crime, official corruption should be important to
ensure high ethical standards in government and our business
institutions.'' He singled out the environment and civil rights as
other areas warranting attention.
   Thornburgh, 56, has been in the Cabinet only since Aug. 12, when
he succeeded Edwin Meese III, who resigned at the conclusion of a
14-month criminal investigation of his affairs. Meese declared he
had been vindicated. But the independent counsel who conducted the
probe, while deciding not to seek an indictment, said Meese probably
had twice broken a federal conflict-of-interest law and violated tax
laws.
   Bush, asked the day after he was elected president if he would
keep on Thornburgh and several other Reagan Cabinet members
considered to be ``Bush people,'' did not answer directly.
   He said that ``some people at various levels may be asked to
remain,'' but that ``there is something to be said for
reinvigorating the process by, with new people.''
   Indeed, Bush insiders had sent mixed signals about the future of
Thornburgh, who was said to be eager to keep his job. At one point,
those insiders had gone out of their way to discourage reports that
his reappointment was assured.
   Other names that had been tossed about as possible replacements
for Thornburgh were William D. Ruckelshaus, a former deputy at
Justice and former Environmental Protection Agency administrator,
and Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson.
   In taking over the Justice Department, Thornburgh, a former
governor of Pennsylvania and U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh, had vowed
to ``make drug trafficking and drug abuse Public Enemy No. 1.''
   Thornburgh headed the department's criminal division during the
Ford administration and established the agency's public integrity
section, which prosecutes corrupt public officials.

   The National Guard patrolled in Tuscaloosa, Ala., while the South
cleaned up today from a barrage of nearly two dozen late-season
tornadoes and storms that killed at least two people and damaged
more than 150 homes.
   The same storm system carried high wind and heavy rain to parts
of Ohio and Pennsylvania on Sunday, ripping off the roof of an empty
school in southwestern Pennsylvania and toppling a 75-foot Christmas
tree in Pittsburgh.
   It later became the first big snowstorm of the season to hit
Maine, dumping sleet and nearly a foot of snow that was blamed for
more than 100 traffic accidents, with two fatalities. Caribou
recorded 10 inches of snow.
   In the Caribbean, Tropical Storm Keith churned off Mexico's
Yucatan Peninsula after becoming the 11th tropical storm of the
season. Forecasters expect it to reach hurricane strength as it
heads into the Gulf of Mexico.
   It could hit Florida late in the week.
   Twisters skipped across Arkansas, Missisippi and Alabama,
uprooting trees, damaging homes and downing power lines this weekend.
   The tornadoes struck unusally late in the year, said Harry Gordon
of the National Weather Service's Severe Storms Center in Kansas
City, Mo.
   One tornado slammed through a three-mile area near the small
northeast Mississippi town of Nettleton, snapping the tops off trees
before dipping into a mobile home park and running along a string of
hills and valleys.
   Two people in mobile homes _ a 37-year-old man and the
9-month-old boy _ were found dead Sunday after the tornado hit. Nine
others were injured, including one hospitalized in critical and one
in serious condition.
   Ten houses and two businesses were destroyed and 24 homes were
damaged, officials said.
   ``It's terrible,'' said Gov. Ray Mabus, who toured the area
Sunday. ``There's nothing that was left standing much in the path of
the storm.''
   Tornadoes also were reported in the Mississippi counties of
Simpson, Bolivar, Sunflower and Leake, with at least 25 houses
damaged in Simpson.
   Three traffic deaths in Mississippi were blamed on wet weather.
The weather is believed to have contributed to six traffic deaths in
Arkansas since Friday. Six people were killed Friday night when a
small plane slammed into a mountain in Batesville, Ark., while
trying to land in dense fog and thunderstorms. The cause of the
crash has not been determined.
   The twin-engine plane slammed into a mountain during its second
attempt to land in dense fog and thunderstorms Friday night.
   A tornado in Tuscaloosa, Ala., early Sunday cut a mile-long path
of destruction, damaging homes and knocking out electrical service
to 3,600 homes. Nearly 100 homes were damaged or destroyed and six
people were injured.
   Mike McCarty said he was on his way into the kitchen when the
tornado slammed into his two-story home.
   ``That's when the kitchen came apart,'' McCarty said Sunday
afternoon. ``The ceiling just vanished. So did much of our house.''
   Dick Pierce, director of the Tuscaloosa County Emergency
Management Agency, surveyed the damage by helicopter.
   ``We're looking at 15 houses totally destroyed, 20 to 25 with
major-to-moderate damage and another 50 to 60 with shingles off or
gutters off or this type of thing,'' he said.
   Buck Medley of the American Red Cross said most people forced
from their homes stayed with friends or relatives. ``We were going
to open shelters, but it wasn't necessary,'' he said.
   Tuscaloosa Mayor Al DuPont said National Guardsmen helped with
the cleanup Sunday and guarded against looting Sunday night. The Red
Cross also set up a disaster center to help those whose homes were
damaged.
   In Pennsylvania, classes were canceled for today at the German
Central Elementary School in McClellandtown after a fierce
thunderstorm tore off the roof of the building Sunday.
   Forty miles to the north in Pittsburgh, a 75-feet-tall Christmas
tree was knocked over by high winds. The artificial tree, boasting
5,812 lights, was erected by Duquesne Light Co. at Point State Park.
   ``The wind is blowing so hard you can't tell how hard it's
raining, but the rain is going sideways,'' said Lynne Lucot, who
works at a supermarket in Aliquippa, north of Pittsburgh.
   Heavy rains in New Jersey on Sunday left four rivers swollen to
near flood stage _ the Millstone, Raritan, Saddle and Ramapo rivers
in the northwestern and northern parts of the state.
   Rain, wind and lightning also forced a halt in departures for a
time Sunday evening at the three major New York area airports, John
F. Kennedy International, Newark International and LaGuardia,
according to Bill Cahill, spokesman for the government agency that
runs them.
   Weekend deluges in Arkansas also spawned flood warnings for
several rivers, including the Ouachita River in Camden and
Arkadelphia in southern Arkansas.

   Tropical Storm Keith nudged past Mexico's Yucatan
Peninsula and buffeted Cuba with its 65 mph winds early today on a
curving track that forecasters expected would hit Florida later in
the week.
   The late-season Caribbean depression grew into the 11th tropical
storm of the season off Mexico Sunday morning, and forecasters
expected it to reach hurricane strength as it headed into the Gulf
of Mexico.
   At 11 a.m. EST, the storm was located about 100 miles north of
Cancun, Mexico, near latitude 22.5 north, longitude 87 west.
Forecasters say they expect it to continue to move north at 12 mph.
Cancun, a popular resort city, was buffeted by Hurricane Gilbert two
months ago.
   ``Heavy showers and thunderstorms continue over western Cuba and
may affect the lower Keys and southwest Florida later today and
tonight,'' said National Weather Service forecaster Gil Clark. But
``the center of Keith is expected to remain over the south central
Gulf of Mexico for the next day or two.''
   The goverment of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning and a
hurricane watch for the northern Yucatan Peninsula, and storm
conditions were expected to spread over western Cuba today. Rainfall
totals of 5 to 10 inches were possible along the path of the storm,
forecasters said.
   People living in low-lying areas of Cancun were evacuated Sunday
afternoon, Mexico's Excelsior news service said. It was unknown how
many left their homes for public shelters.
   However, many homes badly damaged by Gilbert in September
remained unoccupied. Excelsior said flood waters were 3-feet deep in
some areas.
   For much of Sunday, forecasters worried that Keith could race to
southwest Florida with hurricane-force winds of 75 to 80 mph by
Tuesday morning, but Keith lingered off Cozumel, Mexico, as its
steering currents weakened.
   ``It's going to head in this general direction as it turns north
or northeast,'' hurricane center meteorologist Martin Nelson said
late Sunday. ``But in 72 hours, we'd still have it in the Gulf of
Mexico, somewhere west of Key West.''
   The Coral Gables forecasting center predicted the highest
probability, a 1-in-7 chance, of the storm hitting the Gulf Coast
south of Fort Myers by 7 p.m. Wednesday. Keith then was expected to
cross the Florida peninsula and head into the Atlantic Ocean.
   ``It should be at minimal hurricane strength when it hits
Florida,'' said Jim Lushine of the National Hurrican Center.
``Anywhere from the Florida Keys to the Tampa area looks like that's
the major area of concern.''
   Tropical depressions become tropical storms once their top
sustained winds reach 39 mph, and tropical storms become hurricanes
at 74 mph.
   The system passed south of Jamaica as a depression late Friday
and early Saturday, drenching Kingston with nearly 4 inches of rain
in 24 hours.
   The Atlantic hurricane season begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30,
with storm activity usually peaking in mid-September. The season has
spawned two major hurricanes _ Gilbert, which devestated Jamaica and
parts of Mexico, and Joan, which killed scores of people in northern
South America and Central America.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Cautions Against Buying Dangerous Toys</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer group, advising Americans to be on
the lookout for potential hazards as they shop for childrens'
Christmas gifts, today cited baby walkers and crib gyms as products
that cause particular concern.
   The Consumer Affairs Committee of Americans for Democratic Action
said in its annual toy quality and safety report that baby walkers,
which can tip over or topple down stairs, are ``highly dangerous''
and led to 20,790 child injury reports to the Consumer Product
Safety Commission in 1987.
   Crib gyms have caused 674 reported injuries since 1984 and 12
deaths, the committee said. While most manufacturers now include
voluntary warning labels that recommend removal of the gym toys when
a baby can pull itself up to its hands and knees, many carry no such
warning, it said.
   ``Warnings aren't enough,'' the committee said. ``Crib gyms need
to be designed in the first place without hazards. Babies begin to
enjoy crib gyms just at the age that parents are advised to remove
them. So human nature enters the picture and parents leave the crib
gyms a little longer.''
   Overall, the committee said, toys resulted in 131,000 injuries in
1987, 105,000 of them to children under age 15.
   The committee said categories of potentially dangerous toys
include:
   _Some seasonal toys such as inflatable sleds that throw up snow
which could blind the driver.
   _Flammable items, including stuffed animals that burn.
   _Toys that teach children to imitate adults in a dangerous
fashion, such as an electric oven that could burn a child and a play
iron with a realistic-looking plug that could send children to the
nearest electrical socket.
   _Toys that can be dangerous when broken. For example, a medical
kit of poor construction that contains instruments which could break
while a child puts them up to his face, throat, ears or eyes.
   _Items that are dangerous for babies, including rattles that
don't meet specified width requirements which a baby could poke down
its throat and choke on.
   _Toys with inadequate or misleading age labels. In some cases,
manufacturers may label a product containing small parts as ``for
ages over 3,'' but the product nevertheless would be appealing to
younger children.
   The committee laid much of the blame for the abundance of
dangerous toys on what it called the ``pitiful ineptitude'' of the
federal Consumer Product Safety Commission. It said the commission
took just one major toy-related action this year, in banning lawn
darts.
   ``Toy manufacturers, aware they can virtually ignore the CPSC,
understand there's no one watching the store,'' the committee said.
``Manufacturers seldom market dangerous toys willfully, but bottom
line considerations can obscure safety issues.''
   Elaine Tyrrell of the CPSC said it had not yet seen the report
and thus would have no immediate comment on the criticisms of the
agency. She noted that the CPSC will soon issue its own report on
safe and unsafe Christmas toys.
   The committee also said the toy industry experienced a shakeout
in the wake of the October 1987 stock market crash that did not bode
well for consumers.
   ``The response of some toy manufacturers has been to fight a
holding action, suspending creative development and sticking with
tried and true, cheaper production methods, and increased reliance
on offshore production,'' it said.
   The committee offered several tips to use when shopping for safe,
fun and affordable toys, including:
   _Safety. Watch out for sharp edges, small parts, projectiles and
potential danger if toy breaks. Toys that include fabric should say
flame retardant-flame resistant; painted toys should be non-toxic.
   _Buy the toy, not the box. Examine the contents to make sure they
are the same as what's pictured outside.
   _Consider play value. Will the item offer enjoyment for a long
time or lose its appeal after 15 minutes?
   _Battery requirements. Take into account the added expense.
   _Save sales receipts. Some stores will match the price of their
competition.
   _Save toy directions. Always read them, avoid toys with
overcomplicated ones.
   _Potential mess. Consider how messy or destructive a toy will be.
   _Check newspaper ads. Popular toys may go on sale just before
Christmas and be more readily available late in the season.
   _Consider child's age. Good toys should not require constant
supervision to ensure safety or correct use.
   _Avoid ``hot'' items. They may be cheaper next year, and ads may
be overglamorizing them.

<TEXT>
   About 4,000 ethnic Albanians today
defied threats of a crackdown on street demonstrations and marched
to the capital of the restive province of Kosovo, Pristina
television said.
   Leaders of the republic of Serbia renewed their campaign for more
control of Kosovo province following a wave of protests.
   In the liberal northern republic of Slovenia, meanwhile, an
estimated 10,000 people held a peaceful rally in driving snow to
demand a referendum on controversial constitutional amendments.
   Pristina television said today's crowds marched from Orohovac, 40
miles southwest of Pristina, to demand reinstatement of two ethnic
Albanian leaders who were forced to resign under Serbian pressure
last week.
   Police outside Pristina shepherded the crowd as it passed through
the predominatly Serb suburb of Kosovo Polje, the state-run Tanjug
news agency said. No clashes between the rival groups were reported.
   The demonstrations in the southern province of Kosovo, involving
up to 100,000 people last weekend, have been the biggest there since
World War II. The protesters have been angered by the forced
resignations last Thursday of Azem Vlasi and Kacusa Jasari, two
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo's 13-member ruling Politburo.
   The provincial party leadership has promised to review the
resignations of Vlasi and Jasari at a meeting later this week.
   Asked why the the protesters had decided to defy warnings from
numerous Communist party leaders against more protests, student
Skelzen Malici said, ``We are aware of this, but we intend to
continue coming here until the (two leaders) are reinstated.''
   Serbian Communist leader Slobodan Milosevic, who has led the
campaign for more Serbian control of Kosovo, appeared to reject
protesters' demands that the two ethnic Albanian leaders be
reinstated.
   In a speech to Serbian Communist leaders in Belgrade, Milosevic
made no direct reference to the Kosovo protests, but said ethnic
Albanian youths, who made up the majority of the protesters, are
``victims of indoctrination.''
   ``The ideologues of counterrevolution should be held responsible
and not those who are just their arm,'' he addded.
   He said that restoring Serbian control over the judiciary,
schools and policing of Kosovo to stop alleged harassment of the
Slav minority are ``a precondition for Serbian unity.''
   Milosevic said in his speech today that about 500 ethnic
Albanians who have been jailed on charges of fomenting
counterrevolution with alleged nationalism should be freed.
   ``We should let these people out of jail and jail those who are
really responsible for the genocide and terror,'' he said.
   Milosevic and his supporters commonly use terms such as
``genocide and terror'' when talking about the alleged harassment of
Kosovo's Serb and Montenegrin minorities by ethnic Albanians.
   Official statistics show little if any evidence of ethnically
motivated murder or proof of frequently alleged rapes of Serbian
women by ethnic Albanian men.
   Milosevic's is campaigning for changes in the 1974 constitution
that gave Kosovo broad autonomy.
   Communist leaders in Yugoslavia's other five republics see the
campaign as part of a drive to increase the influence of Serbia, the
largest republic, on the Yugoslav federation.
   But Milosevic has said the changes would only put Serbia on an
equal footing with other republics, which have no administrative
provinces like Serbia's Kosovo and Vojvodina.

   President-elect George Bush announced today he
will retain Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Education Secretary
Lauro F. Cavazos, bringing to three the number of Reagan holdovers
in his Cabinet.
   Bush also said he would nominate Richard Darman, former White
House aide and deputy Treasury secretary, to head the Office of
Management and Budget.
   The president-elect said that ``in all likelihood'' Thornburgh,
Cavazos and previously announced Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
would be the only current Cabinet members he would ask to remain in
their posts. All were recent appointments to President Reagan's
Cabinet and took office with Bush's blessing.
   In response to questions from reporters after his announcement,
Bush rejected a General Accounting Office report that dismissed his
``flexible freeze'' proposal for cutting the budget deficit. It said
that tax increases as well as military and Social Security cuts
would have to be considered.
   ``I'm not going to change my view as to how we get this deficit
down,'' he said, though he also said he was ``open-minded'' and
prepared to hear a range of recommendations.
   ``I don't remember any Republicans or Democrats running on a
please-raise-my-taxes program,'' he said. ``I don't remember that.''
   On another subject, Bush said it would be premature for him to
consider any specific proposals that might be put forth next month
when Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev comes to the United States
and meets with President Reagan.
   ``It will be President Reagan's meeting,'' Bush said. ``I'll be
there as vice president of the United States and I expect they'll be
aware they're talking to the next president.''
   He said that ``in terms of specificity, in terms of my committing
a brand new administration to specifics in arms control or anything
else, I'm not going to do that.''
   Bush emphasized the role that Thornburgh would have in fighting
drugs.
   ``Drugs are public enemy No. 1,'' said the president-elect. He
went on to say that Thornburgh ``will work with me to fight drugs
with every tool at our disposal.''
   Bush noted that Cavazos, a former president of Texas Tech
University, is the first Hispanic to hold a Cabinet post but he
added, ``Overriding is Dr. Cavazos' commitment to excellence in
education.'' Bush had promised Hispanic leaders that he would name a
Hispanic to his Cabinet.
   Bush said his choice of Darman underscores his determination to
cut the budget deficit.
   ``Dick Darman understands the numbers,'' Bush said. ``Dick Darman
will play a central role in that effort, which will commence
immediately when I assume office. Because he understands the
government and the economy so well, Dick will make sure the Bush
administration hits the ground running.''
   The president-elect denied he planned to meet Thanksgiving
weekend with his defeated Democratic opponent, Gov. Michael Dukakis
of Massachusetts. But Bush said he did want to meet ``at some
point'' with Dukakis.
   ``I want to do it, I don't want to have a lot of show business,''
he said. ``I want to hold out my hand and say, `the campaign is
behind us.'''
   Cavazos was named to succeed William Bennett in September.
Thornburgh, a former Pennsylvania governor, is a Bush ally who took
office last August.
   Thornburgh and Cavazos will be the second and third members of
the current Reagan administration to remain on the job. Earlier,
Bush said Brady would keep his position. Bush also appointed former
Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III as his secretary of state.
   After his announcements today, Bush met with former Presidents
Ford and Carter to hear the recommendations from a commission they
headed concerning the new administration.
   As they arrived, Carter exclaimed to Bush, ``You look so well
rested!''
   ``The fishing was good. No fish,'' replied Bush, who spent
several days in Florida after the election.
   ``It looks like you haven't done anything all fall,'' said Ford.
   The nation's only other living ex-president, Richard Nixon, was
meeting nearby with Vice president-elect Dan Quayle.
   Bush, asked by reporters what happened to the rumored appointment
of Stanford economist Michael J. Boskin as chairman of the Council
of Economic Advisers, replied, ``Nothing happened. Just don't
believe all the leaks you read in the newspapers.''
   Craig Fuller, co-director of the transition, said, ``We have a
high regard for him. We're still working on the chairman's
appointment.''
   Boskin is a conservative economist and expert on the Social
Security system. He was a father of Bush's ``flexible freeze'' idea
to drive down the deficit.
   The stock market has sagged and the value of the dollar has
fallen since Bush captured the White House on Nov. 8. Many analysts
fear that his no-tax-hike pledge will impede efforts to bring down
the deficit, now growing by $155 billion a year.
   Bush has said he takes the deficit seriously and will work with
Democrats in Congress to forge a solution, but he has shown no
willingness to budge on the issue of taxes. Democrats, meanwhile,
have said they won't take the political heat or a tax increase by
themselves.
   Bush spent a quiet weekend out of the limelight, attending church
Sunday, jogging and conferring at home with Gov. John Sununu of New
Hampshire, his chosen chief of staff.
   Bush revealed last Tuesday that he is keeping his friend Nicholas
F. Brady as treasury secretary. He told reporters Friday he was
concentrating on naming the rest of his economic team before turning
his attention to defense and national security posts.
   In Reagan's second term, Darman was deputy to Baker as treasury
secretary. Both left the government when Baker resigned in August to
run Bush's presidential campaign.

   The judge in the Iran-Contra case said today
the major charges against former presidential aide Oliver L. North
and three co-defendants boiled down to simple allegations of fraud.
   ``I am not trying anything else; it's a fraud trial,'' U.S.
District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell told one of North's lawyers, John
D. Cline, during a hearing on defense motions to dismiss the central
conspiracy charge in the case.
   ``It is fraud in the sense that Chief Justice (William Howard)
Taft and the Supreme Court thereafter have consistently applied'' to
the conspiracy statute, the judge said.
   The defense, supported Friday by a Justice Department brief,
contends North and his three co-defendants could not be prosecuted
for obstructing Congress's foreign affairs authority by running a
secret arms-supply network to the Nicarguan rebels.
   The 1924 decision written by Taft held that defendants did not
have to violate a particular law in order to be guilty of
obstructing government or depriving it of honest service.
   Gesell also expressed puzzlement over defense contentions that
the diversion of arms-sale profits to the rebels, known as Contras,
did not violate the so-called Boland Amendent restrictions on
military aid.
   ``I am having a difficult time understanding why it is necessary
to decide what the Boland Amendment means,'' the judge said.
   The defense contends that the series of amendments enacted by
Congress to ban direct military aid by U.S. intelligence agencies
did not apply to the National Security Council, where North was an
aide until his dismissal two years ago.
   ``The indictment clearly depends upon the application of the
Boland Amendment to the National Security Council,'' Cline told
Gesell, arguing that if it did then it was unconstitutional.
   But Gesell expressed concern over allegations that North and
others falsely assured Congress they were complying with the series
of Boland Amendments.
   ``Is it your position that the executive branch can represent
through its people that they are complying with a statute and at the
same time be affirmatively, knowingly disobeying it because the
statute is unconstitutional?''
   ``That is not the position I am taking,'' Cline said.
   ``Are you saying the president of the United States affirmatively
intended to skim off the profits of the `enterprise' and use them to
buy arms in Nicaragua?'' the judge asked later.
   When Cline demurred again, the judge said the defense argument
``seems like Jello. It doesn't have anything I can pick up with my
hands.''
   North's appearance today in court was his first since Gesell said
the former presidential aide was cynically trying to place himself
above law.
   In a written opinion, Gesell harshly criticized North for arguing
that he couldn't be prosecuted for lying to then-Attorney General
Edwin Meese III or destroying documents during the 1986 presidential
investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.
   That opinion rejected an earlier attempt by North to have charges
against him dismissed. The judge said North ``fails to appreciate
the gravity of his alleged conduct.'' He added that the retired
Marine lieutenant colonel's argument ``reveals a skewed attitude
toward our constitutional form of government.''
   Gesell already has rejected a number of defense motions to
dismiss some of the 15 charges against North, who is the irst of the
four Iran-Contra defendants set to be tried. No date has been set
for the trial.
   North is accused of conspiring with former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter, arms dealer Albert Hakim and retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord to divert illegally U.S.-Iran
arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Still pending are defense motions attacking the central
conspiracy counts against North and his co-defendants, including
arguments that the Boland Amendment _ which banned U.S. military aid
to the Contras at the time _ did not apply to the National Security
Council.
   North also contends that the diversion of arms-sale profits
wasn't illegal because the weapons were no longer U.S. government
property when they were sold to Iran.
   The defense argues that Secord and Hakim owned the weapons after
purchasing them as middlemen in the arms-for-hostage deals.
   The Justice Department lent support to North's defense on Friday,
by challenging Walsh's contention that the defendants can be
prosecuted for conspiring to defraud Congress of its ability to
oversee foreign affairs.
   Walsh contends the clandestine arms-supply network to the
Nicaraguan rebels stymied congressional oversight of foreign policy
and enforcement of the Boland Amendment.
   But the Justice Department said the president, not Congress, has
the power to enforce laws. It argued in a friend-of-the-court brief
that Walsh ascribed to Congress a too-powerful role in foreign
affairs.
   ``Because of the doctrine of executive privilege and the
president's inherent foreign affairs authority, Congress' authority
to compel disclosure of information concerning covert activity is
necessarily subject to formidable constitutional limitations.''
   Nor can Congress ``prohibit the president and his subordinates
from exercising the president's authority to engage in diplomacy or
to exercise covert influence in the realm of external affairs,'' the
department said.
   Assistant Attorneys General Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., of the
criminal division, and Douglas W. Kmiec, head of the office of legal
counsel, said the department was not arguing for or against
dismissal of the central conspiracy count.
   But Dennis conceded that adoption of the department's arguments
might ``narrow the scope'' of the charge.

   Thousands of Lithuanians chanting ``for shame!''
jammed the center of their capital Vilnius today to protest their
legislature's refusal to declare the Sovutonomy from
Moscow, residents said.
   In Moscow, lawmakers recommended changes in constitutional
amendments that have touched off the furor in Lithuania and the
other Baltic republics, iet republic's aEstonia and Latvia, because of
limits they
place on the republics' powers, the daily Pravda said.
   The amendments were proposed by Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev as the keystone of his political reform program, which
includes the creation of a more powerful presidency and a full-time
national legislature.
   In Vilnuis, the Lithuanian Movement for Perestroika's call for a
10-minute noon protest halted traffic in the city center, and about
10,000 people rallied on the city's Gediminas Square, said movement
spokeswoman Rita Dapkus.
   Alvydas Medalinskas, the movement's acting secretary, addressed
the crowd from a balcony and called for the removal of three members
of Lithuania's Communist Party Central Coithuanian words meaning ``for
shame, for shame,'' to criticize the
inaction of their republic's lawmakers, Ms. Dapkus said.
   Medalinskas told the crowd that what happened on Friday ``was
detrimental not only to the (Lithuanian Perestroika) movement, but
to all of Lithuania,'' she said.
   The grassroots movement has called for another meeting of
Lithuania's Supreme Soviet by Nov. 29, and is collecting signatures
on petitions that call for such a session.
   What Ms. Dapkus called a ``symbolic strike'' was to last for 10
minutes throughout Lithuania. She said traffic had come to a
standstill in Vilnius, but there was no word yet from Lithuania's
other cities.
   Police in central Vilnius took no steps to interfere with the
rally on Gediminas Square, she said.
   Ms. Dapkus, who is from Chicago, said she will be leaving the
Soviet Union this week to set up an information bureau for the
Lithuanian movement in the United States.
   Pravda said today that a commission of the Supreme Soviet had
recommended modifications in amendments to the Constitution that
were proposed by Gorbachev and the national leadership as an
apparent attempt to placate the Baltic republics.
   As originally written, the amendment to Article 108 authorizes a
newly created Council of People's Deputies to ``take decisions
relative to the composition of the U.S.S.R., the approval of the
formation of new autonomous republics and autonomous regions in the
composition of the union republics.''
   The commission recommended that article be changed to limit the
council to questions ``of national-state structure relative to the
jurisdiction of the U.S.S.R.''
   Article 108 also authorized the council to annul legislation and
acts of the Soviet republics if they contradict the Constitution.
The commission, which met Saturday, recommended that such language
be stricken as part of an effort to increase ``the development of
the sovereign rights of the republics,'' Pravda said.
   However, the lawmakers also condemned the action of the Estonian
Supreme Soviet, saying its decision on Wednesday to give local laws
primacy over Soviet legislation was at odds with the 1977 Soviet
Constitution.
   Their ruling was transmitted to the Supreme Soviet Presidium, the
nation's highest executive body, possibly presaging a striking down
of the Estonian decision by the Kremlin leadership.
   Estonia, Lithuania and the third Baltic republic, Latvia, were
independent after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution until 1940, when
they were annexed by the Soviet Union.
   The small Westward-looking republics have used President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's political reforms _ dubbed ``perestroika'' _ to push
for greater economic and cultural autonomy.
   Baltic residents contend that proposed amendments to the Soviet
Constitution will limit their autonomy.

   Chicago must hold a mayoral election
next year to fill the two years remaining of the term of the late
Mayor Harold Washington, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled today.
   The high court ruled without dissent. It said that a reading of
state election law, along with the state law governing
municipalities, requires that a special election be held to fill a
vacancy that occurs with more than 28 months left on a four-year
term.
   Washington, the city's first black mayor, died of a heart attack
Nov. 25, 1987, with 3{ years left of his second term.
   ``The scheme recognizes the importance of the voters not to have
a mayoral appointee who is not of their own choosing for more than
28 months,'' Justice Joseph Cunningham wrote in the court's opinion.
   A lower court ruling already has called for a primary Feb. 28,
followed by a general election April 4.
   The decision was eagerly awaited by a crowded field of announced
and unannounced mayoral candidates. Unannounced candidates include
the incumbent acting mayor, Eugene Sawyer, and front runner Richard
M. Daley, who were both said to be awaiting the ruling before
announcing. Neither had any immediate comment after the ruling was
handed down today.
   Daley, son of the late mayor Richard J. Daley who died in 1976,
just won a landslide re-election as Cook County state's attorney and
was the leader in a recent poll of potential mayoral contenders.
   ``That's no surprise. ... I never had any doubt that it would be
1989,'' said Democratic Alderman Edward Burke, who has already
announced his candidacy. ``We of course would have preferred that
the question would have been cleared up a lot earlier.''
   Sawyer, who is black, was appointed acting mayor a year ago by a
bitterly divided City Council after receiving the support of
Washington's white council opponents. He has trailed in the mayoral
polls to another black Democrat, Alderman Tim Evans, who has claimed
to be Washington's true political heir.
   In Chicago, a strongly Democratic town where no Republican has
been mayor for more than a half-century, the primary is considered
decisive. Many observers have said that if Evans and Sawyer split
the black vote in the February primary, and other white candidates
step aside, it could pave the way for a victory by Daley. The city's
population is 40 percent black.
   Sawyer, 54, had supported the 1991 date, but has said repeatedly
he is prepared to run a campaign immediately.
   Though Daley, 46, has declined to say whether he will run, close
associates have been quoted as saying they expect him to make a bid.
There are three other white candidates who have already announced,
but two of them are considered likely to pull out if Daley runs.
   Daley lost to Washington in a three-way Democratic primary in
1983, when he and incumbent Mayor Jane Byrne split the white vote.
   Evans today called the ruling ``a great victory'' for the people
of Chicago.
   Candidate Lawrence Bloom, the white liberal alderman who was a
staunch Washington ally, agreed.
   ``I think it's the decision the public wanted. They didn't want
29 members of the City Council to elect their mayor for three
years,'' said Bloom. He is not considered to be much of a factor in
the race but insists he's in it to the end.

   Israel is considering taking sanctions against
Egypt, such as delaying resolution of a border dispute, following
Cairo's recognition of a declared Palestinian state, a government
official said today.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Israel's
10-member Inner Cabinet would discuss Egypt's move at its meeting
Wednesday and debate possible sanctions in response.
   One sanction idea likely to be raised was delaying an Israeli
withdrawal from the Taba Beach in the northern Sinai Desert, he
said. A team of international arbitrators ruled two months ago that
the disputed beach belonged to Egypt under a 1979 peace treaty.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres summoned Egyptian Ambassador
Mohammed Bassiouny for a meeting today to express his ``sorrow and
disappointment'' at the Egyptian decision, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said.
   Peres said Sunday he regretted Egypt's decision and called the
proclamation of a state by the Palestine Liberation Organization ``a
setback in political terms because it has succeeded from a media
point of view.''
   Egypt is the third country which has diplomatic relations with
Israel to recognize the Palestinian state declared last week by the
Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile, in
Algiers, Algeria. The others are Turkey and Cyprus.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo's plane was forced to make
an emergency landing at a small Pennsylvania airport after its
occupants smelled smoke, and officials had no immediate explanation
for the problem that led to the plane's third unscheduled landing in
1{ years.
   Federal Aviation Administration investigators arrived at the
Williamsport airport today to look over the plane, which landed
early Sunday after occupants reported smelling smoke, according to
Thomas Hart, airport manager. New York state officials also planned
to examine the plane, said Cuomo spokesman Terry Lynam.
   It was not determined Sunday if there was a fire or just
something overheating in the plane, said Gary Fryer, a spokesman for
the governor. The plane was bring the governor home from a speaking
engagement in New Orleans.
   Cuomo and his aides smelled smoke at about 1:30 a.m.he closed airport,
he
said.
   Pilot Bud Hill told Fryer that the incident was ``potentially
dangerous,'' but the governor's pilots maintained control of the
plane.

   Upbeat Republican governors opened a
conference today with top appointees to George Bush's new
administration on hand and newly renamed Cabinet members on the way.
   ``The transition happening in Washington is actually happening
right here,'' said Delaware Gov. Michael N. Castle, chairman of the
conference.
   Twenty of the nation's 23 Republican governors, along with two
governors-elect, were on hand for opening ceremonies, with all
holding hand on heart for the Pledge of Allegiance and national
anthem.
   The formal opening occurred after President-elect Bush said he
would retain Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Education
Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos in their Cabinet posts in the new
Republican adinistration.
   Thornburgh and Cavazos both were on the governors conference
program today, along with Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire, whom
Bush recently named as his new chief of staff, and former Bush
campaign manager Lee Atwater, whom Bush has recommended to be
chairman of the Republican National Committee.
   The president-elect is to meet with the governors Tuesday.
   Castle said the lineup of influential Bush staff members and the
president-elect put the conference ``as much in the forefront of
changing events'' as any such meeting could be.
   ``I think this administration in Washington is going to be even
more sensitive to the states,'' said Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft.
   Castle and Ashcroft commented Sunday aboard the U.S.S. Lexington,
an aircraft carrier docked off Pensacola, Fla. Nine of the GOP
governors put on flight helmets and flew by jet to the carrier for a
tour.
   Before the conference, being held at the Grand Hotel resort on
Mobile Bay, most of the Republican governors made clear they support
Bush on major domestic issues, including his pledge against new
taxes.
   ``I think right now would be an inappropriate time to talk about
new taxes,'' said New Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers.
   ``If he believes he can do without taxes, I am going to support
him,'' said Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, who did not plan to attend
the conference because of a legislative session. His and Carruthers'
comments were made in interviews before the start of the forum.
   Castle said the conference this year was unique in that a new
administration was coming into power and the president-elect planned
to attend along with influential members of the new administration.
   ``We will be able to lay out some of our priorities,'' he said.
   Ashcroft added, ``We want to develop an even better dialogue with
the president-elect.''
   Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt, the host of the conference, was one of the
few governors who said Bush may yet switch from his no-tax stand. He
said Bush may support an increase in taxes if necessary after ``you
cut all the waste you possibly could.''
   But, he said, ``not having looked at the books on the national
level, I really couldn't answer the question.''
   Castle said he opposed more taxes, emphasizing that initiatives
being taken at the state level are helping to reduce long-range
government problems and costs.
   ``Welfare reform demonstrated the states' ability to put forward
a workable solution to a complicated problem, one that will save a
great deal of money in the long run by helping people get off
welfare,'' he said.
   ``In virtually every area where the federal government mandates
programs, I believe the states can do a better job in running
them,'' Castle said.

<TEXT>
   Lack of public accountability and an
inefficient bureaucracy have created a nightmare of sinking ships,
rebels who escape from birthday parties and foodstocks that vanish.
   Some problems which have beset the Philippines recently can be
explained by bad luck, including three tropical storms that killed
more than 600 people in two weeks.
   But others appear the result of appalling lack of organization,
resources and efficiency in President Corazon Aquino's
administration. Lack of public accountability contributes to an
atmosphere where accidents wait to happen.
   That in turn may be undermining public confidence in government.
   A recent survey by Ateneo University of 1,200 people nationwide
found just 31 percent expected their lives to improve. Forty-two
percent expected conditions to remain the same and 17 percent said
they would get worse.
   ``It is not enough that the president sets the example,'' wrote
the Philippine Daily Inquirer on the issue of accountability. ``She
should also find the strength and conviction to make examples of
officials who do not measure up.''
   On Nov. 12, the alleged chief of the Communist rebel army
escaped. The military says Romulo Kintanar, 41, and his wife Gloria,
38, walked away from a birthday party for the former stockade
commandant.
   Acting stockade commander, Maj. Benjamin Landrito, offered as an
excuse that he was asleep in his office at the time.
   It was not the first security breach at the stockade.
   Kintanar's host, Lt. Col. Robelito Comilang, was suspended last
month when a right-wing officer jailed for a leading role in an
August 1987 coup attempt reportedly walked through three doors that
were supposed to be locked, climbed the stockade wall and was
fatally shot by guards.
   Mrs. Aquino today blamed the six military coup attempts that
rocked her administration on her efforts to seek rapproachment with
communist rebels during a 60-day cease-fire that expired in February
1987.
   ``The right-wing fringe of the military ... launched a succession
of destabilizing attempts to topple me from power,'' she said. ``The
assassination of leftist leaders discredited my commitment to human
rights.''
   In June, dozens of armed men tried to free former Gov. Orlando
Dulay, jailed in the 1986 deaths of several Aquino supporters.
Raiders failed to free Dulay but made off with armory weapons.
   Mrs. Aquino has demanded a full investigation into Kintanar's
escape. Three senior officers, including Landrito and Comilang, have
been relieved and restricted to quarters.
   But there is widespread skepticism about change.
   ``There has not been any real investigation, much less real
punishment of people concerned,'' fumed Sen. Ernesto Maceda,
chairman of the Senate Defense Committee. ``There is a tendency to
cover up. In the spirit of comradeship, they just cover up the
incident to control the damage.''
   Maceda's doubts were based on the failure of previous
investigations to fix responsibility, punish those at fault and
implement changes.
   Commissions failed to solve the September 1986 assassination of
labor leader Rolando Olalia, the August killing of Local Governments
Secretary Jaime Ferrer and the September 1987 slaying of leftist
leader Lean Alejandro.
   Another commission organized after the January 1987 killing of 13
land reform protesters by soldiers guarding the presidential palace
never established who gave the order to fire.
   The senior officer on duty at the time, Brig. Gen. Ramon Montano,
was furloughed as capital regional commander during the probe. But
months later, he was promoted to major general and given command of
the national police.
   Three separate commissions investigated the December 1987
collision of the passenger ship Dona Paz with the oil tanker, in
which more than 3,000 people were believed to have perished.
   All three found evidence of widespread inefficiency in the
maritime industry, including overloaded ships, lack of adequate
communications, poorly trained crew and the absence of effective
search and rescue procedures.
   But Commodore Carlito Cunanan, who as coast guard commandant was
responsible for maritime safety, was promoted to navy commander
after the Dona Paz disaster.
   Last month, the Dona Marilyn, another passenger ship owned by the
same company, sailed into Typhoon Ruby and sank with 500 people
aboard, about half of whom remain missing and feared dead.
   Although the investigations into the second sinking have not been
completed, officials say they have found evidence of many of the
same shortcomings which led to the Dona Paz disaster.
   ``The country is one big Dona Marilyn sinking in the middle of a
storm while the captain snores on top of a mahjong table,'' wrote
columnist Francisco Tatad. ``Many (heads) should roll.''
   Lack of accountability has not been limited to the military. In
September, Mrs. Aquino fired Emil Ong as chairman of the National
Food Authority after two investigating committees found evidence of
widespread incompetence.
   They cited, among other things, the disappearance of $350,000
worth of rice, which Ong said sank on three barges. The coast guard
had no record of the sinking.
   Ong was furloughed during the investigations, then fired. Two
days after he was dismissed for incompetence, Ong was named
presidential adviser for regional government affairs.
   Also in September, retired Maj. Gen. Cesar Tapia quit as security
chief of Manila's international airport, claiming he was powerless
to stop rampant corruption there. Despite his allegations, most
customs and immigration officials remain on the job there.

   A five-pound sculpture made out
of butter that has gone rancid is not art, a court ruled Monday.
   The court rejected a claim for $29,000 filed by Johannes
Stuettgen, who alleged that the work titled ``Corner of Fat'' by his
teacher, Joseph Beuys, was ruined when it was dropped by a cleaning
crew at the state Academy of Art in Duesseldorf.
   The crew was cleaning up Beuys' studio after he died in 1986.
   Stuettgen said Beuys had given him the sculpture when they worked
on it together in 1982.
   ``This object of rancid butter was for laymen not recognizable as
artwork,'' the state civil claims court for North Rhine-Westphalia
said in explaining its rejection of Stuettgen's claim.

<HEAD>China Urges Soviets to Resume Afghan Pullout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The suspension of the Soviet troop pullout from
Afghanistan is a worrisome move that could endanger a general
worldwide trend toward detente, an official magazine said Monday.
   ``The various flashpoints in the world are interrelated in one
way or another,'' the weekly Beijing Review said in an editorial.
   ``It was precisely the signing of the Geneva accords on the
Afghan question in April that led to dialogues and negotiations on
many other regional issues, contributing to the general trend
towards relaxation in international relations,'' the magazine said.
   The suspension of the Soviet troop withdrawal, announced Nov. 4,
could ``weaken or even reverse the general trend toward detente,''
it said.
   The editorial did not mention any specific examples, but it may
have been referring in part to improvements in Chinese-Soviet
relations in recent months. The two countries split bitterly in the
1960s over ideological and strategic differences, and China has
refused to normalize relations until the Soviets remove their troops
from Afghanistan.
   The Soviet Union sent troops there in 1979 to help replace one
Marxist leader with another, and has kept them since to battle
anti-Marxist Afghan guerrillas.
   The Soviet Union partially met another Chinese demand, to reduce
its troop presence on the Chinese border. The third demand is to
pressure its ally, Vietnam, to withdraw from Cambodia.
   Chinese leaders' comments on the prospects for better relations
with Moscow have been more positive since the Soviets began their
troop pullout from Afghanistan on May 15. Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen goes to Moscow next month in the first working visit there by
a Chinese foreign minister since 1956.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping said recently that a Chinese-Soviet
summit could be held as early as next year.
   In suspending its pullout from Afghanistan, the Soviet Union
blamed increased attacks by the Afghan guerrillas.
   But the Beijing Review said the move ``raised doubts about
whether the Soviets are going to live up to the Geneva agreement.''
   ``The Soviet Union ... should implement the agreement in earnest
and withdraw all its military forces from Afghanistan as
scheduled,'' it said. ``It should not look for any pretexts to
delay.''

   Afghanistan's state-run radio today
said all 27 passengers and crew members aboard a Afghan transport
plane died when it was shot down by Pakistani forces over the
weekend.
   A Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman said the plane was flying
several miles inside Pakistani airspace when it was attacked
Saturday evening near the border town of Parachinar.
   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity said it was not
clear how many people were aboard the plane.
   The Radio Kabul broadcast, monitored in Islamabad, said the An-26
plane was en route to the eastern city of Jalalabad from the Afghan
capital when technical trouble developed.
   The pilot put out a call for assistance but was ignored by
Pakistan authorities, the radio said.
   ``Instead of helping pakistan shelled surface-to-air rockets at
the plane against all international laws and norms,'' said the radio
broadcast.
   The Pakistani spokesman said: ``The plane was asked to identify
itself and it didn't. It was going deeper into Pakistan's territory
when it was shot down.''
   He did not say how contact had been made with the plane.
   Pakistan has repeatedly complained of air violations by
neighboring Afghanistan.
   The two countries signed a U.N.-mediated agreement in April
providing for the withdrawal of more than 100,000 Soviet troops
estimated to be in Afghanistan.
   The Kremlin pulled out half of its troops Aug. 15. The remainder
are expected to leave by Feb. 15, 1989.
   The Soviet Union has been supporting the Marxist Kabul government
in its fight against U.S.-backed Moslem insurgents.

   Newfoundland voters today cast the first ballots
in national elections Prime Minister Brian Mulroney hopes will give
him a parliamentary majority to ratify the U.S.-Canada free trade
agreement.
   The controversial trade pact, which has dominated the rancorous
campaign, would phase out all remaining tariffs on trade between the
two countries starting Jan. 1.
   Polls opened at 9 a.m., beginning with the Atlantic coast
province of Newfoundland, which is in a time zone 90 minutes ahead
of eastern standard time. Polls close at 8 p.m.
   Canadian evening television coverage was scheduled to start at 8
p.m. EST. Canadian television is delaying its coverage to western
time zones so that voters can go the polls without knowing early
results.
   British Columbia on the Pacific coast, where polls close at 11
p.m. EST, could be decisive in any close race.
   Opposition leader John Turner has urged Canadians to vote for his
Liberal Party because he opposes the trade agreement and is seeking
``to keep Canada Canadian.''
   Turner revived his party's chances during the 51-day campaign by
accusing Mulroney of selling out Canada.
   Mulroney, 49, in turn charged Turner with using``scare tactics,''
including allegations the pact would wreck social programs and cost
many Canadians their jobs. Mulroney brought out his mother to show
his committment to retirement benefits.
   Mulroney voted in his home town of Baie-Comeau, Quebec, where he
told reporters he planned to spend the day walking in the snow and
getting out the vote.
   New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent was in his home town of
Oshawa, an auto center in Ontario east of Toronto, while Turner was
the last to vote because of the Pacific coastal time in his
Vancouver, British Columbia, home district.
   Polls in the campaign's final days showed Mulroney's Progressive
Conservative Party had returned to favor after a two-month slide
attributed to the effectiveness of the 59-year-old Turner's attacks.
   The opinion surveys showed the governing Conservatives in good
position to win a slim majority of the 295 seats in the House of
Commons, which would allow the Canadian parliamentarians to ratify
the 10-year trade pact.
   The leader who can muster a majority of at least 148 seats
controls the government.
   The socialist New Democratic Party also opposes the free trade
agreement and could play a decisive role in any close outcome.
   A poll Saturday by Gallup Canada indicated the Conservatives had
the support of 40 percent of the decided respondents, the Liberals
35 percent and the New Democrats 22 percent.
   Turnout among Canada's 17.5 million eligible voters was expected
to be higher than the 1984 elections, when about one in four didn't
show up.
   If successful, Mulroney could become the first Canadian prime
minister to win successive majority governments since 1953. The
Liberals were ousted in a 1984 landslide spearheaded by Mulroney.
   Decisive results could be determined in the country's most
populous provinces, Quebec and Ontario, after polls close there at 8
p.m. EST. But results may not be known until late at night because
of polls closing in Alberta and British Columbia.
   Support for the agreement is strong in French-speaking Quebec,
and opposition runs high in English-speaking Ontario.
   Mulroney has asked for another term this time not only to go
ahead with the free trade agreement but to extend economic policies
he credited with creating 1.3 million jobs. Canada, like its more
populous southern neighbor, is in the sixth year of an economic boom.
   Mulroney maintains the trade pact he signed with President Reagan
guarantees future Canadian prosperity by assuring access to the much
larger U.S. market. The two countries have about $150 billion in
annual trade.
   Advocates of the trade deal see a huge North American
marketplace, with entrepeneurs on both sides of the border enjoying
equal competitive access.
   The Liberals, who have played a dominant role in Canadian
politics for much of this century, appeared in trouble at the outset
of the campaign, with some predicting they could sink to third place
behind the New Democrats.
   But Turner revived the party's chances with a strong
nationalistic attack on the free trade agreement, calling it ``a bad
deal for Canada.'' He accused Mulroney of selling out the world's
second-largest country, and tapped into powerful currents of
nationalism dating to Canada's founding 121 years ago.
   The Liberal leader, who served as prime minister for 79 days in
1984, argued that Canada's 26 million people would be overwhelmed by
the larger population of 245 million and vastly greater economic
power of the United States.
   Free trade came to overshadow all other issues in a campaign that
generated an unusual amount of interest throughout Canada as well as
abroad.
   The trade pact, approved by the U.S. Congress, needs final
Canadian parliamentary approval.

   U.S. officials will travel to 15 American
cities next year to get opinions about what world trade policy
should be in the administration of George Bush, Anne Brunsdale,
acting chairwoman of the International Trade Commission, said Monday.
   ``Listening to America ... the concerns of business executives,
labor leaders, politicians and others interested in the impact of
tariffs on U.S. industries and consumers ... is crucial if the
International Trade Commission is to offer informed advice to the
U.S. Trade Representative,'' she said in a statement.
   At a briefing she added that other barriers to trade as well as
tariffs will be discussed at the hearings to be held by the
six-member commission. They will begin Jan. 30, 1989, in Houston and
conclude in Washington on April 4.
   Ms. Brunsdale said she expects that Clayton Yeutter, the U.S.
Trade Representative, will be writing her in the next few weeks to
outline the kind of information he wants. Yeutter has been the chief
U.S. representative in the ``Uruguay round'' of negotiations with
nearly 100 countries covering the entire range of international
business, not only in manufactured goods but also in farm products
and services such as banking and air traffic.
   A key meeting is due next month in Montreal, Canada. Yeutter is
expected to resign his post afterwards and to be replaced after Bush
takes office Jan. 20.
   The commission is a federal agency that decides whether imports
hurt or threaten to hurt particular U.S. industries, and it
recommends what action should be taken. Its advice goes directly to
the president.
   If the ITC decides that an imported item has been sold in this
country at less than its fair value, or has been subsidized by
another government, it can issue an order imposing extra customs
duties.
   It also makes extensive reports to the president and his advisers
on trade issues.
   The commission also will appear at hearings in: New Orleans, Feb.
1; Miami, Feb. 3; Atlanta, Feb. 6; Los Angeles, Feb. 13; San
Francisco, Feb. 15; Portland, Ore. Feb. 17; Denver, Feb. 24;
Chicago, Feb. 27; Minneapolis, March 1; Kansas City, Mo, March 2;
New York, March 13; Boston, March 15; and Pittsburgh, March 17.

   Three senior Solidarity advisers Monday
said they were ready to discuss technical details of next week's
live TV debate between Lech Walesa and the head of Poland's official
trade union alliance.
   The advisers also proposed holding the debate at the Lenin
Shipyard in Gdansk and also suggested that Poland's most famous
movie director, Andrzej Wajda, be allowed to film it.
   The statement was issued by Solidarity national spokesman Janusz
Onyszkiewicz, historian Adam Michnik, and opposition activist Jacek
Kuron, who were chosen by Walesa to settle technical issues of his
Nov. 30 debate with Alfred Miodowicz, chairman of the trade union
alliance known as OPZZ.
   Miodowicz first proposed a TV debate with Walesa in an interview
in the Communist Party newspaper Trybuna Ludu on Nov. 15.
   Walesa promptly accepted Miodowicz's challenge, saying he had
long sought a debate with Miodowicz, who has headed the official
unions since they were set up by the government in 1982 after it
banned Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union.
   Trade union pluralism will be the main issue discussed during the
debate. Solidarity and the OPZZ hold opposing views on the number
and organization of trade unions within factories and on the shop
floor.
   An OPZZ official said the union was prepared for a meeting with
the Solidarity advisers to discuss the debate's technical details.
   ``As far as I know if the representatives of Walesa's side will
come to us directly, if it concerns only technical details, I think
we can hold such a meeting,'' said OPZZ Deputy Chairman Jerzy
Uzieblo.
   Uzieblo said there will be no moderator, although other issues
still must be worked out.

<TEXT>
   Carlos Salinas de Gortari, president-elect of
Mexico, hopes his meeting Tuesday with George Bush will establish a
personal bond and set the pattern for U.S.-Mexican relations.
   His task will not be easy, given the Mexican view that its
powerful neighbor constantly tries to impose its political and
economic will south of the border, but Salinas' advisers hope he and
the U.S. president-elect will form the basis for a working
relationsship.
   Salinas, a Harvard-educated economist who takes office Dec. 1,
will meet Bush for three hours Tuesday in Houston.
   ``Both Bush and Salinas are men with open minds who are willing
to listen to the interests and concerns of others. We have different
problems and common interests,'' said Juan Enriquez, a former
Harvard University professor who works in the Mexico's governing
Revolutionary Institutional Party, known by its Spanish initials PRI.
   As Salinas sees it, Mexico must resume economic growth and cannot
do so without reducing the burden of payments on its $102 billion
foreign debt, which drain economic resources and leave little money
for development.
   Some Mexicans fear Bush and the U.S. government may see drug
trafficking as the main bilateral problem and try to blame Mexico
for letting drugs into the United States.
   The governments have managed to work out temporary or partial
solutions to other problems, including water contamination along the
border and access to U.S. markets for Mexican products.
   Even foreign policy disagreements over Central America have been
played down in recent years.
   Victor Hugo Celaya, a Mexican congressman who is president of the
Border Commission, said the United States ``is becoming more aware
of our economic realities. The United States must re-examine its
policies in the region or it will risk the chance of being isolated
geopolitically.''
   He said the Houston meeting underlines ``the need to resume and
expand our dialogue and start the two new administrations with
common points of view and programs for collaboration and
development.''
   Outgoing President Miguel de la Madrid had six meetings with
President Reagan marked by U.S. demands, often irritating to Mexico,
that it do more to fight drug trafficking.
   ``Our relations with the United States have always been
difficult, so difficult that we lost half of our territory last
century,'' de la Madrid said in an interview last month. ``Nowadays,
it is a challenge for Mexico to live next to the biggest, richest
and most complex country in the world.''
   Mexican foreign policy is often at odds with that of the United
States, especially in Central America, and Mexicans feel U.S.
government officials do not understand their culture and politics
well enough.
   Mexico is an easy target for U.S. officials who complain of
corruption and failure to stop the drug trafficig drug trafficking.
The Mexicans say they do the best they can with limited resources.
   At his final meeting with Reagan, last February, de la Madrid
said bluntly the best way to fight the drugs was for citizens of the
United States to stop using them.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Customs Service inspectors seized more
than 1,400 pounds of high-grade cocaine with an estimated street
value of $28 million, the Customs Service said Monday.
   The cocaine was found Nov. 11 in suburban Jefferson in a shipment
of 55-gallon drums of resin from Guatemala, but announcement of the
confiscation was delayed because Customs wanted to try to catch the
buyers, said spokeswoman Liz Orgeron.
   ``What we were trying to do was make a controlled delivery to see
if we could make an arrest,'' said Orgeron.
   She said that was done last week, but no arrests were made and
the 1,424 pounds of the drug was turned over to the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
   The seizure was the largest ever in New Orleans, said Orgeron.
   She said the cocaine was on a ship that carried goods from
Central America _ a fact that prompted Customs agents to look
closely at the cargo. The resin containers got special attention
because resin rarely comes into the Port of New Orleans, she said.
   She said the Customs' Contraband Enforcement Team drilled into 60
drums of resin and found cocaine in 12. When those 12 drums were cut
in half with acetylene torches, inspectors found smaller, 30-gallon
drums surrounded by layers of tar and each containing about 45
one-kilogram bricks of cocaine.

<TEXT>
   Sixty-eight Mississippi inmates, including
convicted killers, will head home for Thanksgiving on Tuesday as
part of the state's holiday furlough program.
   A variety of criminals who have maintained good records and
cleared a Department of Corrections screening will earn the
furloughs, said interim Corrections Commissioner Charles Jackson.
   Although no estimate of the total number of inmates heading home
this year was available, 68 are scheduled to depart Tuesday, Jackson
said. Holiday furloughs usually range from three to 10 days.
   During the last holiday season, 539 inmates were allowed out on
furlough, Department of Corrections spokesman Ken Jones said.
   Jackson, who signs inmates' passes, said he strongly considered
calling off the furloughs in the wake of a $3 million verdict
against three former state Parole Board members.
   The members, who voted to release an inmate who later shot and
paralyzed Jackson bank executive Linda Grantham, were found by a
Hinds County Circuit Court jury to be negligent in the case filed by
Ms. Grantham.
   Parole and holiday furloughs are separate programs. But the
precedent has been set for liability if an inmate on release injures
someone, Jackson said.
   ``We are going to have a Christmas leave program this year as in
the past, but because of recent happenings, we are going to be more
strict on screening people and not going to go over it once, but go
over it twice to make sure we have covered every base,'' Jackson
said.
   State law allows the corrections commissioner to grant personal
leave to certain inmates.
   Only trusty inmates are eligible for consideration. They must
have served a set minimum part of their sentences, ranging from
eight months on a one-year sentence to at least four years of any
sentence of 21 years to life, Jones said.
   Mississippi law specifically bars special leave for any person
convicted of a sex crime, Jackson said, while Corrections Department
rules bar other inmates, including those sentenced to terms without
hope of parole.

<HEAD>Iraqi President Accuses Son of Killing His Bodyguard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein said Monday his
eldest son, Odai, bludgeoned to death a presidential bodyguard, and
he ordered an investigation into the slaying.
   In a letter to the minister broadcast on state radio, Hussein
said Kamel Hana Gegeo was killed the night of Oct. 18 when the
trusted bodyguard was firing his gun in a private villa near the
presidential palace in Baghdad.
   He said Odai sent his own bodyguard to ask Gegeo to stop
shooting, but Gegeo did not obey. Odai and his bodyguard went to see
why Gegeo disobeyed him, as well as a presidential order that
prohibits firing personal weapons during celebrations.
   Odai went to Gegeo and asked him if he received his order to stop
shooting and when the bodyguard said yes, Odai hit him with a wooden
bat.
   Gegeo was rushed to a hospital where he died the next day from a
head wound.
   Odai, 25, is the oldest of the president's five children.
   In Nicosia, Cyprus, sources said the bodyguard was particularly
close to the president and a distraught Hussein accompanied Gegeo's
body to a church for funeral preparations.
   The guard, believed to be in his 20s, was the son of the
president's cook and the governess of his three daughters, the
sources said.
   They detailed a different version of the killing circulating in
Baghdad, with Odai firing the gun and the bodyguard killed while
trying to quiet him.
   Hussein said he investigated the murder and referred the case
``so that justice is done.''
   He said Odai is in jail and has tried to commit suicide three
times since Gegeo died.
   The president described his Gegeo as a trusted person and ``a man
who never disobeyed him.''
   He said his son had not committed such a crime before and
described the murder as ``a will of God which cannot be prevented.''
   ``It is my constitutional responsibility to enforce justice in
the society ... and that does not exempt anyone,'' Hussein said in
his letter.
   Hussein ordered Justice Minister Akram Abdul Qader Douri to
investigate the death.

   David Hare's ``The Secret Rapture,'' due
off-Broadway in May, was named best play for 1988, and a revival of
the musical ``South Pacific'' was honored as best musical in awards
presented by Drama Magazine.
   Top acting awards went to Pauline Collins as best actress for the
one-woman comedy ``Shirley Valentine'' and, in a tie vote for best
actor, Alex Jennings for the Russian satire ``Too Clever By Half''
and Tom Wilkinson for Henrik Ibsen's ``An Enemy of the People.''
   Vanessa Redgrave was named best supporting actress for her
performance as Nora Melody in a revival of Eugene O'Neill's ``A
Touch of the Poet.'' Best supporting actor went to Peter Lindford,
who played Mephistopheles in a west London production of Johann
Wolfgang Goethe's epic ``Faust.''
   Best director went to Peter Brook, the Paris-based British
director, for his marathon staging of ``The Mahabharata,'' which was
seen in Glasgow, Scotland, in May as part of its world tour.
   The design award went to Richard Hudson for his season of work at
the Old Vic Theater, where he is the resident designer under its
artistic director, Jonathan Miller.
   Sir Michael Hordern, 77, received a special award in honor of his
distinguished acting career. He most recently appeared onstage a

<HEAD>Soviet Military To Make Plumbing Parts to Ease Housing Crunch</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Part of the Soviet Union's vast defense industry
will be turning out plumbing parts for use in a crash program to
build more housing, a government official said Monday.
   Yuri P. Batalin, deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers, or
cabinet, said the military has the facilities for manufacturing the
items needed, so defense plants will be put to work turning out the
equipment.
   ``This is happening because available capacities in the defense
industry will be reoriented. Rather than producing armaments, they
will produce plumbing items,'' Batalin told a news briefing.
   The involvement of the military in civilian housing programs is
just one way Soviets hope to tap various sources for increasing the
country's stock of construction equipment and supplies.
   One city dweller in five lives in a dormitory or communal
apartment shared with other families. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
has proclaimed the goal of building enough new housing so each
Soviet family can have its own apartment or house by the year 2000.
   In February, the government announced a plan for citizens to take
out large bank loans to build private homes. But even for the
enterprising, housing construction often is frustrated by lack of
necessary materials.
   ``The market resources will have to grow,'' said Yuri P. Boyev,
deputy Soviet minister for material and technical supplies. ``We
will have to provide the market with the needed materials.''
   Boyev said officials understand the shortage of supplies and are
trying to speed up production of everything from plumbing parts to
linoleum. He said his department made 20,000 square yards of
linoleum in 1985 and expects to make 57,000 square yards next year.
   Individual credits for housing construction are not new, but had
been issued on a limited basis until the announcement of the private
loan program. Last year, the government provided $720 million and in
10 months of this year will have provided $2.8 billion, Batalin said.
   Private construction had been discouraged in official attempts to
cut down on pilferage of hard-to-come-by building materials from
state enterprises.
   Batalin said recent changes to permit more economic autonomy in
the country's 15 constituent republics will create more of a
marketplace atmosphere, alleviating the shortages of materials.
   N.A. Nazarbayev, chairman of the Council of Ministers of
Kazakhstan, one of five Central Asian republics, said the exchange
of goods between the republics had at times been arbitrary and
unresponsive to needs.
   For instance, he said, Kazakhstan provides the Baltic republic of
Estonia with grain and receives footwear in return, when what
Kazakhstan really needs is timber, which is plentiful in Estonia.
   Nazarbayev said the self-financing plan will permit the republics
to barter or sell products directly for much-needed supplies, adding
impetus to the housing construction program.

   More than 100 world leaders passed along
greetings of peace Monday in the 16th annual World Hello Day
organized by two Nebraska brothers.
   President Reagan and Prince Charles and Princess Diana were among
the participants this year in the unofficial ritual designed to
promote world peace with a series of simple ``hellos.''
   ``I guess when you get the heads of states of 100 countries
together on anything you have really accomplished something,''
co-founder Michael McCormack said.
   McCormack, 36, was attending Harvard University in 1973 when he
and his brother Brian, 31, started World Hello Day in response to
the growing tension in the Middle East.
   Since then, the annual event that involves greeting at least 10
people in the name of peace has attracted international attention.
   The brothers received letters of support this year from the
leaders of 101 countries, ranging from Australia to Zaire.
   Last week a letter arrived from the White House with a ``warm
hello'' from Reagan, and on Monday the brothers heard from the
secretary general of the League of Arab States.
   Others who have participated in World Hello Day include Pope John
Paul II, Mother Teresa, the late Indian Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, the late
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias
Sanchez, Queen Elizabeth II and former Presidents Gerald Ford and
Jimmy Carter.
   McCormack said he has received thousands of letters this year
from everyday people, but it is the notes from famous leaders that
draw the most attention.
   ``The president of Beijing University (in China) told me that one
of the things World Hello Day does is mobilize people to act in a
specific way to promote peace. It gives them a taste of what it is
like to participate in that process,'' McCormack said.
   Letters have arrived from Prince Charles and Princess Diana,
Olivia de Havilland, Billy Graham, Jim Henson, Charlton Heston, Lee
Iacocca, Richard Leakey, James A. Michener, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold
Palmer, Luciano Pavarotti, Stevie Wonder and Pele.
   ``You talk about a grassroots movement that goes from the ground
up,'' McCormack said. ``What we have done is work from the other
direction _ from the crowns of the trees down to the roots. People
are interested when they say their own head of state has written a
letter and supports World Hello Day.''
   McCormack, who devotes all his time to the annual event, said he
doesn't have much interest in trying to gain official national
status for World Hello Day in the United States.
   ``I think what we would like to do is keep it a day that becomes
a special day because people want to make it a special day on their
own, not because it is an official holiday,'' he said.

<HEAD>Scientists Find Tombstone Conditions Give A History Of Pollution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two University of Delaware researchers have
found that marble tombstones provide a unique record of air
pollution that shows the clean-up efforts of the last two decades
appear to be working.
   By measuring the deterioration rates of about 2,000 tombstones in
cemeteries from Newark to Norristown, Pa., geography professor
Thomas C. Meierding and graduate student Johan Feddema have produced
an outline of air pollution history in the Delaware Valley.
   The study found extensive differences in pollution levels between
areas and suggests that pollutants that have nearly dissolved some
headstones likely have extensively damaged other structures.
   Many tombstones in central Philadelphia _ the hardest-hit area in
the study _ are so weakened from decades of sulfur dioxide deposits
that they ``flex under slight pressure,'' Feddema said. Their
surfaces are so disfigured from flaking that many inscriptions have
disappeared.
   In contrast, tombstones examined in Delaware cemeteries show less
wear, and those in areas with excellent air quality, such as Hawaii
and rural Nebraska, show almost no deterioration.
   The researchers surveyed tombstones placed between 1790 and 1840,
restricting their study for the most part to markers made from
marble extracted from southeastern Pennsylvania quarries. They
measured the base and tops of 30 tombstones in each cemetery and
compiled an average weathering figure per cemetery.
   The difference between the bases and the tops, which were more
exposed to the wind-borne pollutants, showed the rate at which the
stones deteriorated.
   The researchers calculated the deterioration rate according to a
100-year scale and found that an urban tombstone may deteriorate at
10 times the rate of a stone in a rural graveyard.
   They also found that a distance of even a few miles from an
industrial area can lead to markedly different pollution rates. For
example, the destruction of tombstone faces by pollutants was as
high as 47 percent in central Philadelphia but only 2 percent in the
nearby countryside.
   Because tombstones are widespread, remain relatively untouched
over time and are easily damaged by air-borne pollutants, they
present a fairly simple gauge for air quality, said Meierding, who
has been awarded a National Science Foundation grant to survey
pollution patterns in tombstones nationwide.
   The researchers said the tombstones appear to have been most
affected by gaseous sulfur dioxide, which spurs the growth of gypsum
crystals that cause marble to shed large flakes and lose strength.
   However, both Feddema and Meierding believe acid rain, which can
carry pollutants great distances, has made only a slight
contribution to the deterioration. They point instead to local
sources of pollution, such as coal-fired power plants, steel mills
and refineries.
   The pioneering study, reviewed last week during an environmental
forum in Newark, also suggests:
   _The worst pollution damage occurred between the 1930s and 1960s.
   _Sulfur dioxide damage to marble tombstones probably depicts the
way air pollutants have damaged building materials like cement,
brick and metal.
   _Air pollution controls to limit emissions installed in the last
two decades appear to be working. After 1970, rates of deterioration
in tombstones seem to have improved, reflecting the cleaner skies.
   _The comparison of tombstone damage may be used to compare the
costs of pollution damage between regions. If central Philadelphia
has suffered 10 times the pollution of Newark, costs associated with
that pollution should be 10 times more in Philadelphia, he said.

   Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia today became the
second U.S. congressman to be indicted in the Wedtech corruption
scandal.
   A federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted Garcia, a six-term
Democrat; his wife, Jane Lee Garcia; and a San Juan, Puerto Rico,
attorney, Ralph Vallone Jr. on bribe-related conspiracy charges.
   The indictment was released by the office of U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani. The prosecutor said today that the Wedtech
investigation is continuing.
   Garcia was the 18th person to be indicted in the past decade to
be indicted on criminal charges while serving in Congress.
   Garcia, 55, a Democrat from the South Bronx, easily turned away
primary and general election challenges to win a sixth term earlier
this month.
   Through his spokesman, Bill Danvers, Garcia said he was innocent
and vowed to fight the charges ``with all of my God-given strength.''
   ``I am grateful that this period of trial by grand jury leaks is
finally over,'' the statement said. He said the charges stemmed from
``the preposterous allegations of Mario Moreno, one of the most
notorious felons of the 20th century.''
   Moreno was one of four Wedtech officials who pleaded guilty to
bribing government authorities and cooperated with prosecutors. He
had testified that Garcia and his wife had received money and
jewelry as bribes for their work on behalf of the now bankrupt
defense contractor.
   Garcia, who was born in New York, was the second person of Puerto
Rican descent to be elected to Congress. Former Rep. Herman Badillo,
also of New York, was the first.
   On Friday, former U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi, another Bronx Democrat,
was sentenced to eight years in prison for his part in the Wedtech
scandal.
   He and several others were convicted in August of turning
Wedtech, a now-defunct defense contractor, into a cash cow that
produced millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks.
   Wedtech was a tiny South Bronx machine shop that grew into a
multimillion-dollar-a-year defense contractor through a Small
Business Administration program that allowed minority-owned firms to
obtain government contracts without competitive bidding.
   But allegations of bribery, influence-peddling and other
wrongdoing, enmeshed Wedtech in a series of federal and state
investigations that forced it into bankruptcy proceedings in
December 1986.
   To date, at least 19 people caught up in the Wedtech scandal have
been convicted of crimes ranging from racketeering to illegal
lobbying.
   They include former White House aide Lyn Nofziger, who was
convicted of illegal lobbying, and two former Maryland state
senators, convicted of taking $50,000 in bribes from Wedtech.
   Two one-time associates of former U.S. Attorney General Edwin
Meese III have also been indicted on Wedtech-related racketeering
charges and are scheduled to go on trial early next year. Meese was
never indicted, although a special prosecutor questioned the former
attorney general's ethics after a lengthy investigation.

<HEAD>Fed Proposes New Curbs On Bank Acquisitions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board on Monday proposed a
rule imposing tighter restrictions on the ability of state-chartered
banks to acquire non-banking subsidiaries.
   The rule, proposed by a 6-1 vote with board member Martha Seger
dissenting, would require that the approximately 7,000
state-chartered banks owned by holding companies get the Fed's
permission before estabishing real estate, insurance and other
non-banking subsidiaries.
   Proponents of the rule say some states have moved aggressively to
authorize new activities without regard for bank safety and
soundness. Opponents say the Federal Reserve should not seek more
power over state banks.
   Regulation Y, adopted in 1971, has allowed state banks to
purchase non-bank firms without Fed approval under the Bank Holding
Company Act.
   The change could be adopted in three to six months. It would
exempt non-bank businesses already owned by state-chartered banks,
although Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson asked the Fed
staff to solicit comment on the possibility of requiring divestiture
of such activities.
   A recent federal court ruling requires nationally-chartered banks
to receive Federal Reserve permission before acquiring a non-bank
subsidiary. The decision is being appealed and the Federal Reserve's
staff said it would propose rules for national banks later.

   A lawyer for confessed TWA
hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi said Monday his client was mentally ill
and he asked the court to authorize a psychiatric examination.
   Also Monday, a former hostage fought back tears as he recalled
offering to take his son-in-law's place when the hijackers took
several hostages off the plane in Beirut.
   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger made no immediate ruling on
lawyer Hans-Burkhardt Steck's request for a psychiatrist.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and air
piracy in the hijacking of TWA Flight 847 after it left Athens for
Rome in June 1985. U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed and 39
Americans were held hostage for 17 days.
   Hamadi admits he was one of the hijackers but denies killing
Stethem.
   Steck said Hamadi ``appears to be an adult in many things, but is
a child that had been hindered in his development.''
   He said Hamadi was ``mentally disturbed at the time of the
hijacking'' but had wanted ``a bloodless hijacking.''
   ``The mental and physical damage'' Hamadi had suffered from
fighting in Lebanon ``should have an influence on the sentence.''
   While Steck spoke, the mother of the slain diver, Patricia
Stethem, walked out of the courtroom, apparently fighting back tears.
   She and her husband, Richard, have followed all 34 sessions since
the trial opened July 5.
   Later, American real estate developer Vincente Garza testified
that his son-in-law, Robert Trautmann, was among several hostages
taken off the plane at Beirut Airport and hidden in the city.
   ``I thought he could be the first to be shot, and I asked Hamadi
`don't take him away, take me.' Hamadi just pushed me back,'' said
Garza, 57, his voice cracking with emotion.
   Another American testified that she feared the hijackers would
harm her because she is Jewish.
   ``I heard screams and beatings on more than one occasion,'' said
Mauri Schwarz, a 36-year-old computer saleswoman. ``I was very
afraid because I am Jewish and I didn't know if they knew it.''
   Ms. Schwarz said she saw one passenger ask for medical help
because he had a heart condition ``but the hijackers refused.''
   Hamadi denied this when asked to comment.
   ``If anyone had asked me for a doctor, I would have done that,''
he said.
   The court Monday completed cross-examining Dr. Burton Weber,
whose testimony was interrupted Nov. 15 when Hamadi said he felt ill.
   Weber said Hamadi appeared ``less wild and less mean'' than his
accomplice, Hassan Ezzeddine, who is a fugitive.
   ``He (Hamadi) was not kind and nice and good, but in my mind he
was less frightening,'' Weber said.
   Under court guidelines to protect witnesses, former hostages do
not reveal their hometowns.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in 1987 after customs
officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.
   The United States requested his extradition last year, but the
West German government turned it down, fearing for the lives of two
West Germans held hostage in Lebanon. The hostages since have been
released.
   Hamadi's older brother, Abbas, is serving a 13-year prison term
in West Germany in connection with the kidnappings.

<HEAD>Baby Walkers, Crib Gyms Top This Year's Dangerous Toys List</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents who go Christmas shopping for their
kids should beware _ there are more dangerous toys than ever before,
a consumer group warned Monday.
   While there are a variety of specific toys which are potentially
harmful, entire classes of toys _ baby walkers and crib gyms _ were
singled out as dangerous by the Consumers Affairs Committee of the
Americans for Democratic Action.
   The 17th annual report of the private, non-profit organization
also was critical of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the
federal agency which oversees toys and other consumer goods.
   A ``major reason for the abundance of dangerous toys'' is ``the
pitiful ineptitude'' of the CPSC, the report said.
   Elaine Tyrrell, a spokeswoman for the CPSC, said the agency would
not have any comment because it hadn't yet seen the report. But she
noted that the CPSC soon will issue its own set of Christmas toy
guidelines.
   The report said ``dangerous and potentially dangerous toys are
more available than ever this year. Our consumer group was inundated
by potentially dangerous toys.''
   The report cited CPSC statistics which blamed toys for causing
131,000 injuries last year, including 105,000 to kids under 15 years
old.
   Baby walkers can tip over or topple down stairs, making them
``highly dangerous,'' the report said. The CPSC received 20,790
injury reports last year from baby walkers, the group noted.
   Crib gyms have caused 12 deaths and 662 other injuries in the
past five years, the report said.
   ``Warnings aren't enough. Crib gyms need to be designed in the
first place without hazards,'' the report said. ``Babies begin to
enjoy crib gyms just at the age that parents are advised to remove
them. So human nature enters the picture and parents leave the crib
gyms a little longer.''
   Among the toys cited by the ADA panel as potentially dangerous:
   _Inflatable sleds, some of which throw up snow that could blind
the driver.
   _Flammable items, including stuffed animals.
   _Household-type toys urging children to imitate adults in a
dangerous fashion. The report cited an electric oven which could
burn a kid and a toy iron that has a realistic-looking plug that
could send children to the nearest electrical outlet.
   _Items which could be dangerous if broken. One example cited was
a toy doctor's kit which included realistic-looking plastic
instruments that could break when a child puts them up to his face,
throat, ears or eyes.
   _Items dangerous for babies, including rattles that don't meet
specified width requirements. A baby could choke on that rattle, the
report said.
   _Toys with inadequate or misleading age labels. In some
instances, manufacturers label a product containing small parts as
``for ages over 3,'' but it still appeals to younger kids.
   Parents who go toy shopping in the next month should keep several
things in mind, the report noted, including:
   _Safety. Look for sharp edges, small parts, projectiles and
potential danger if the toy breaks. Toys with fabric in them should
say the material is flame retardant or flame resistant. Painted toys
should be non-toxic.
   _Look at the toy, not the box. Examine the contents to make sure
it is the same as what's pictured outside.
   _Consider the toy's play value. Will the child enjoy it more than
once or be bored after 15 minutes?
   _Batteries. Few toys include batteries.
   _Save sales receipts. Some stores will match the price of their
competition.
   _Read the directions. Avoid toys with instructions that are too
complicated.
   _Check newspaper ads. Popular toys may go on sale just before
Christmas and be more readily available late in the season.
   _Consider the child's age. Good toys should not require constant
supervision to ensure safety or correct use.
   _Avoid ``hot'' items. They might be cheaper next year, and ads
overglamorize them.

   Alexander Dubcek, the former
Czechoslovak Communist Party leader, paid homage Monday to victims
of a World War II massacre and condemned fascism as ``the enemy of
democracy.''
   Dubcek, who is on his first visit outside Czechoslovakia in 18
years, visited a shrine honoring the hundreds of civilians killed by
Nazi troops in this town near Bologna on Oct. 2, 1944.
   He paused in silence in front of a monument honoring the
Czechoslovak village of Lidice, which was rebuilt after being razed
by the Nazis and is a sister city to Marzabotto.
   ``I am honored to be here, in this place which testifies to what
Nazism meant,'' Dubcek said. ``Fascism is the enemy of democracy. We
should remember that and do what is necesary so that what happened
is never repeated.''
   He laid a wreath at a tombstone and signed the guest book with a
message expressing hope for ``peace, understanding and general
collaboration among nations.''
   Dubcek, who came to Italy earlier this month to receive an
honorary degree from the University of Bologna, tried to liberalize
Czechoslovakia's political and economic system through the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms of 1968.
   The movement was crushed by a Soviet-led invasion and Dubcek was
removed from the party.

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Illinois Supreme Court set the stage
Monday for Chicago's third mayoral free-for-all in six years, ruling
that voters must decide who serves the last two years of the late
Mayor Harold Washington's term.
   Siding with city officials who scheduled a Feb. 28 primary and an
April 4 general election next year, rather than waiting until 1991,
the court said Mayor Eugene Sawyer's appointment by the City Council
after Washington's death does not extend through 1991, when
Washington's term ends.
   Washington died of a heart attack on Nov. 25, 1987, less than
eight months after winning a second term.
   The seven justices ruled without written dissent that state laws
governing vacancies in office were designed to ensure that an
appointed official would not serve such a long portion of an
unexpired term.
   Supporters of a 1991 election had argued their case was supported
by the state Election Code, which says the mayor of Chicago should
be chosen in a spring election every four years beginning in 1979.
The court said that only prescribes regularly scheduled elections
``where the incumbent official continues in office.''
   Sawyer, who supported a 1991 election but has indicated he is
prepared to run next year, said he was ``pleased that this decision
has been made and that the people in Chicago are no longer in
limbo.''
   ``We are ready for the upcoming election and look forward to
winning it,'' said Sawyer, who raised nearly $3 million in less than
a year against the possibility of a spring election.
   The ruling also drew applause from the field of announced and
would-be candidates poised to make next year's mayoral race the most
crowded in the city's recent history.
   ``I think it's the decision the public wanted,'' said Alderman
Lawrence Bloom, a staunch Washington ally who was among the first to
announce his candidacy for a 1989 mayoral race. ``They didn't want
29 members of the City Council to elect their mayor for three
years.''
   Cook County State's Attorney Richard M. Daley, widely reported to
be planning a second bid for the job his father held for two
decades, said he would make an announcement ``in the next two
weeks.''
   ``This is a serious decision,'' Daley said.
   Aldermen Timothy Evans and Danny Davis, both considered leading
contenders for Washington's mantle of black political leadership in
Chicago, also praised the decision.
   According to a recent Chicago Sun-Times-ABC television poll,
Daley is supported by 37 percent of all voters. Evans was second at
22 percent, Sawyer third with 10 percent, and Bloom fourth with 9
percent.
   The remaining 22 percent was divided among the other announced
candidates _ Davis, Alderman Edward Burke, former Chicago Parks
District Superintendent Edmund Kelly _ and ``undecided.''
   The possibility of three black candidates _ Sawyer, Evans and
Davis _ raises the possibility of a split in the black voting bloc
that made Washington the city's first black mayor in 1983, and
lifted him to re-election in 1987.
   Such a split would strengthen Daley, who split the white vote
with former Mayor Jane Byrne in a 1983 Democratic primary and thus
helped Washington move into the general election, in which Democrats
historically have been prohibitive favorites. No Republican has been
Chicago's mayor for more than half a century.
   Monday's court ruling came in a suit filed in April by Evans'
supporters, who sought the early election in an effort to deny
Sawyer time to consolidate his power.

   Sponsors of a library documenting the
Reagan presidency have had to steer around a variety of pitfalls,
from liberal Stanford University professors to a rare six-inch
sunflower.
   Groundbreaking here Monday for the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library was made possible by a compromise with environmentalists
that protects the sunflower and two other rare plants.
   Before that, the Ronald Reagan Foundation had to overcome
concerns that the project would detract from a section of rolling
coastal mountain range set aside by local planners as a protected
area.
   And all that came after the foundation abandoned its original
plans to construct the library on a 20-acre Northern California site
at Stanford in conjunction with a proposed policy center.
   Neighbors of the university had complained about expected tourist
traffic, while liberal professors didn't want the campus used to
enshrine the memory of a conservative champion.
   Stanford's trustees split the library from the proposed policy
center in 1984, but planning for the library continued into 1987, up
to the point that blueprints were unveiled with fanfare in
Washington.
   In April 1987, the foundation canceled its Stanford plans,
publicly citing the separation three years earlier of the library
from the policy center.
   In the ensuing months, a number of potential sites in Southern
California were rumored to be under consideration, including the
University of California, Riverside and the University of Southern
California.
   But the nod went to a site outside Simi Valley, some 50 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, a former country town that has become a
bedroom community. The library will be set in dry hills covered with
scrub brush and dotted with cactus _ perhaps a fitting setting for
the first president whose start in public life was as a cowboy actor.
   Community concerns, more muted this time, centered on visitor
traffic and the location in an area set aside as a natural buffer
between three growing communities. Environmentalists envisioned
bulldozers rumbling over the tiny yellow sunflower known to
scientists as Pentachaeta lyonii, as well as two other rare plants.
   But environmental objections were headed off by compromise: The
foundation will try to replace any plants it destroys, work to
protect and spread the species on the site, and limit public hours
to minimize traffic.

   Christina Onassis died of acute
pulmonary edema, or accumulation of fluid in her lungs, a judge said
Monday. Investigators reportedly were focusing on whether the Greek
heiress died from an overdose of barbiturates.
   Judge Juan Carlos Cardinali said the cause of death was included
in a partial report he received from forensic experts who performed
the autopsy on Miss Onassis following her death Saturday, apparently
of a heart attack.
   Heart attacks can cause the accumulation of fluid in the lungs,
or pulmonary edema.
   Medical examiners reportedly were looking into various possible
causes of death. Cardinali was quoted by the private news agency
Noticias Argentinas as saying investigators were focusing on the
possible ``excessive ingestion of barbiturates.''
   Family members and friends repeatedly have ruled out suicide.
   Three jars of medicine and other evidence found in Miss Onassis'
bedroom were taken by police Sunday for analysis, the private news
agency Diarios y Noticias reported Monday. Another bottle of pills
reportedly was missing.
   Miss Onassis, the 37-year-old daughter of Greek shipping magnate
Aristotle Onassis, died at the country club home of close friends.
   One of three doctors who allegedly examined Miss Onassis at the
country club and pronounced her dead was questioned by police and
two judges who have jurisdiction in the case, Diaros y Noticias
reported.
   Miss Onassis frequently went on diets to combat a persistent
weight problem, and she was known to take diet pills. It was not
known if she was on diet pills at the time of her death.
   Tissues taken from Miss Onassis' body at an autopsy Saturday
still were being examined, Cardinali's secretary said in a telephone
interview.
   The full coroner's report was expected to be delivered to
Cardinali later Monday. It was unclear whether he would publicly
disclose its contents.
   The judge said he still is awaiting a determination on the cause
of the edema as well as results of a chemical analysis and other
pathological studies performed on the body.
   Miss Onassis was the stepdaughter of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,
the widow of President John F. Kennedy who married Aristotle Onassis
in 1968.
   When her father died in 1975, Miss Onassis inherited half of the
family's estimated $1 billion fortune. The other half is controlled
by the Alexander Onassis Foundation, set up in memory of Onassis'
only son, Alexander, who died in a 1973 plane crash.
   Miss Onassis had four unsuccessful marriages. Her last husband,
French industrialist Thierry Roussel, arrived Monday from Geneva to
wrap up legal proceedings and accompany the body to Skorpios, the
Onassis family's island in the Ionian Sea off the northwest coast of
Greece.
   Roussel is the father of Miss Onassis' only child, 3-year-old
Athena, who stands to inherit her mother's entire fortune. Roussel
will have custody of the child until she comes of age.
   The newspaper Clarin reported Monday that Miss Onassis intended
within the next two weeks to marry Jorge Tchomlekdjoglou, brother of
her longtime friend and weekend host in Argentina, Marina Dodero.
   The newspaper cited sources it did not identify in Buenos Aires'
Greek community. Telephone calls placed to the homes of the Doderos,
the family Tchomlekdjoglou and Miss Onassis' aunt, Mary, were
unanswered.
   On Saturday, Miss Onassis was taken from Tortuguitas Country
Club, 25 miles north of the capital, to a private clinic and then to
Clinica del Sol Hospital in Buenos Aires, where she was pronounced
dead on arrival.
   Federal Judge Alberto Piotti, whose district includes Tortuguitas
Country Club, prohibited the removal of Miss Onassis' body from
Argentina without his authorization, citing ``errors of procedure''
in transfering the body from his district to Buenos Aires.

   President-elect George Bush and Mexico's
incoming President Carlos Salinas de Gortari meet Tuesday in Houston
in a bid to move cross-border relations onto a smoother track after
an extended period of recriminations.
   Bush said last week that with new administrations in both
countries taking office at about the same time, a ``tremendous
opportunity'' is available for a cooperative relationship.
   Last Friday, Bush conferred at length on the meeting with House
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. Bush has promised that after taking
office he will take no measures that affect Mexico without first
consulting Mexican authorities.
   Bush will be accompanied to the luncheon meeting at the Johnson
Space Center by Secretary of State-designate James Baker and
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. Salinas, who will be inaugurated
on Dec. 1, will be accompanied by top aides as well.
   Economic issues will be at the top of the agenda, but the
discussions also are expected to touch on drug smuggling, Central
America and other issues.
   Salinas has said that Mexico's obligations in servicing its $108
billion foreign debt should be designed in a way that permits
continued economic growth.
   He is worried that protectionist trade pressures in the United
States could lead to a decline in Mexico's cross-border exports,
further aggravating an economic crisis that has afflicted the
country since 1982.
   A rise in U.S. interest rates also would impair Mexico's ability
to repay its debt.
   While the two countries have shown an ability to cooperate on
economic issues, there have been serious disagreements over Central
America and drugs.
   The Reagan administration has said that, aside from Cuba, no
hemispheric country has supported Nicaragua's leftist government
more enthusiastically than Mexico, which has played a leading role
in the Central American peace process.
   In the 1987 U.N. General Assembly, Mexico supported the U.S.
position on issues of high priority to the United States less than
15 per cent of the time, according to State Department figures.
   One official, insisting on anonymity, said Assistant Secretary of
State Elliott Abrams and Mexico's Foreign Secretary Bernardo
Sepulveda have a ``shoot on sight'' relationship.
   Both Abrams and Sepulveda will be replaced by their respective
incoming presidents. A State Department official said there are
preliminary indications that the new foreign ministry team being
assembled by Salinas may be less ideologically opposed to U.S.
administration views.
   In a recent interview, Abrams said, ``We have been very unhappy
with what we consider the kind of ideological tone in some of
Mexico's foreign policy as distinct from a pragmatic tone.
   ``There have been occasions when we felt that Mexico was picking
a fight with the United States, not because it was in the interest
of Mexico to do so, for what must have been complex reasons in
Mexico's foreign policy and Mexico's domestic politics.''
   One recent sign of Mexico's pursuit of an independent foreign
policy was a visit to Cuba by outgoing Mexican President Miguel de
la Madrid, who conferred Mexico's highest civilian decoration on
President Fidel Castro.
   On the drug issue, Mexico believes the United States bears much
of the blame for continued narcotics trafficking across the border
because of the strong U.S. demand for drugs.
   The Reagan administration has been increasingly emphasizing a
need to reduce demand but maintains that ``corruption and
inefficiencies'' in Mexico have impeded efforts to curb the drug
flow.
   According to the State Department, Mexico is the principal source
country for the production, processing and trafficking of heroin and
marijuana entering the United States.

<HEAD>Almost 25 Years Later, Kennedy Monument Recovered In Wolcott</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOLCOTT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A marble-and-brass monument commemorating
John F. Kennedy's visits to the Waterbury area has been found nearly
25 years after it was cast and stored to await the opening of the
presidential library in Massachusetts.
   Robert Carroll, a member of the committee that commissioned the
monument in 1964 in the wake of the president's assassination, said
Monday that he discovered the monument in a Wolcott High School
storage room in September.
   He said he didn't tell anyone about the discovery until recently
so the news would coincide with the 25th anniversary of the
assassination on Tuesday.
   The Wolcott residents who commissioned the monument intended to
send it to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library on the
University of Massachusetts campus in Boston's Dorchester section.
   ``I think once they (at the library) see this, it's really the
kind of a monument _ it's probably valued at $4,000 to $5,000 _ that
belongs there,'' Carroll said.
   The white marble plaque with a brass plate, the cost of which was
underwritten by the Scovill Manufacturing Co. and Chase Brass &
Copper Co., both of Waterbury, memorializes Kennedy's visits to
Waterbury on the eve of the 1960 election and in 1962.
   An estimated 50,000 people greeted Kennedy on Nov. 6, 1960 at 3
a.m. in downtown Waterbury. Wolcott borders Waterbury and Carroll
said many of its residents hail from the blue-collar city.
   The monument bears the presidential seal and a quotation from a
speech Kennedy delivered on his second visit to Waterbury, on Oct.
17, 1962:
   Carroll said a black-tie ball in Waterbury in November 1964 was
held to remember the late president's promise. His mother, Rose
Kennedy, attended, Carroll said.
   ``The problem (in 1964) was that the Kennedy Library had not been
built yet, so the plaque had to be stored somewhere until the
library was complete,'' he recalled.
   Carroll said he suggested keeping it in a closet in the high
school. The monument was promptly forgotten, he said.
   He said he had intended to bring it to the library on the
assassination anniversary, but the library's curator and one-time
Kennedy assistant, David Powers, reminded him that ``the family
doesn't prefer to remember that date.'' Instead, Carroll said he
will take the plaque to Boston next year on May 29, the late
president's birthday.
   Powers said the library will accept the plaque, but he couldn't
say whether or not it will be displayed.

   Stanford economist Michael Boskin said Monday
he was surprised by reports that President-elect George Bush was
about to name him chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers.
   Boskin said he was sitting at home in California watching
television when he first heard news reports over the weekend that he
was about to be appointed Bush's chief economic adviser.
   ``I was quite suprised by the rumors,'' Boskin said in a
telephone interview. ``It is flattering to have my name mentioned as
a possibility, but President-elect Bush has many outstanding
individuals who would make excellent appointments to the CEA.''
   A conservative economist and expert on the Social Security
system, Boskin is the father of Bush's ``flexible freeze'' idea to
drive down the deficit. He is still considered the front-runner to
be named chairman of the economic council.
   Bush, when asked by reporters on Monday what had happened to
Boskin's appointment, said, ``Nothing happened. Just don't believe
all the leaks you read in the newspapers.''
   Craig Fuller, co-director of the transition, said, ``We have a
high regard for him. We're still working on the chairman's
appointment.''
   Boskin called reports of the appointment ``premature'' and said
he has not yet received any offer of a job in the Bush
administration.
   Boskin, who described himself as a ``mainstream conservative,''
said he expects Bush ``will move quickly and decisively to assemble
an outstanding team to assist him in the transition and the
government. But this won't happen overnight. It may take a few
weeks.''
   He praised Bush's selection of Richard Darman as head of Office
of Management and Budget, saying, ``Dick Darman is one of the most
talented people I know.''
   In addition to Darman as OMB director, Bush has asked Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady to stay on in his administration.
   That leaves the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers as
the only top economic post remaining to be filled.
   Bush has said that he considered the naming of his economic team
to be a priority as a way of sending a signal to jittery financial
markets that the new administration planned to get a quick start in
reducing the federal budget deficit.

   For Thanksgiving dinner, Barbara used to fix
herself a small salad while the rest of her family sat down to
turkey and dressing.
   Lisa skipped dinner altogether one year and instead took an
overdose of pills.
   What should have been a holiday was a nightmare for the two women
because they suffered from anorexia. The thought of a bountiful
feast spread out before them repulsed them.
   But this year, both Barbara and Lisa will sit down to a
traditional Thanksgiving meal with several hundred others who suffer
from eating disorders. The dinner is a part of the annual National
Eating Disorders Week originated by their doctor, Felix Larocca, a
child psychiatrist who specializes in treating disorders like
anorexia and bulimia.
   ``It's kind of like a homecoming,'' said Barbara, who asked that
her last name be withheld. ``You feel a little more comfortable
sitting with people who you know have the same problem. It's a
little easier to eat.''
   The dinner will be a traditional one, with all the trimmings:
roast turkey, dressing, wild rice, broccoli, glazed carrots, mixed
fruit, dinner rolls, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie and carrot cake.
   Victims of anorexia refuse to eat because they believe themselves
fat even when they're dangerously underweight, while bulimia
sufferers binge and purge, eating sometimes enormous amounts of food
and then throwing up.
   Most of those who suffer from these eating disorders are young,
white women, bt more and more cases are being diagnosed among men,
blacks, Asians and children.
   Larocca is the founder of BASH Inc., which stands for Bulimia
Anorexia Self-Help. Based in St. Louis, it is an internationally
known program for people with eating disorders.
   The annual dinner began five years ago to help Larocca's patients
shift the focus of the Thanksgiving holiday away from food. ``The
idea is to socialize, to get reacquainted,'' he said. ``The dinner
is played down.''
   The first dinner was held after Lisa tried to commit suicide with
the overdose she took while home from college for Thanksgiving.
   ``She said she couldn't handle it, she hated the holiday,''
Larocca said. ``People talked about food and insisted everybody take
seconds.''
   ``It was a miracle she survived, but she made it and lived.''
   Last year, about 300 past and present patients of Larocca's,
their families and friends attended the meal. In conjunction with
the meal, seminars and workshops on eating and mood disorders are
offered.
   BASH is the outpatient program for the BASH Treatment and
Research Center, based at Deaconess Hospital in St. Louis. The
program, which Larocca founded in 1981, seeks to restore proper
eating habits to patients through behavior modification, individual
and group therapy and nutritional guidance.
   Both anorexia and bulimia can be fatal. Besides malnutrition,
victims of eating disorders can suffer electrolyte imbalances, which
can cause abnormal heart rhythms, and amenorrhea, the loss of
menstruation. Frequent vomiting by bulimics can lead to tooth decay.
One victim was pop singer Karen Carpenter, who died in 1983 at the
age of 33 of complications of anorexia.
   Sufferers also can become addicted to diet pills and laxatives,
which can lower the body's potassium content, making heart failure a
risk.
   Larocca said compulsive exercising is now being recognized as yet
another tool for people who suffer eating disorders. ``Exercise
addicts start quite innocently,'' he said. ``But once they get
caught in the treadmill of exercise, they suffer anxiety when they
can't get their fix.''
   Larocca's self-help program began with a suggestion from several
of his anorexic and bulimic patients, who met in a group with him
once a month, that a meeting that included relatives of people with
eating disorders would be beneficial.
   BASH now reaches some 6,000 people in the St. Louis area, and
with the distribution of its newsletter, more than 15,000 people
around the world, Larocca said. It also operates a 24-hour toll-free
crisis hotline.
   Both Barbara and Lisa have recovered, although they still find
the meetings helpful for dealing with self-image problems.
   ``Now I don't feel I have to go so much for myself, but to help
other people,'' said Barbara, who spent one Thanksgiving in the
hospital being fed through tubes. ``It's just amazing that knowing
that other people have been through the same things helps a lot.''

<HEAD>GAO Calls for Flexibility in Production Controls</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New farm legislation should include more
flexibility in the control of crop production so that producers can
respond more readily to market opportunities, a report to Congress
said Monday.
   The General Accounting Office report, one of a series about
issues in the forthcoming Bush administration, said the anticipated
1990 farm bill needs to retain the authority of the Agriculture
Department to influence crop production in times of surplus and
scarcity.
   But the GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said the current
farm law, enacted in 1985, has had several shortcomings.
   The law has helped U.S. agriculture to become more competitive in
the world market while maintaining farm income, the report said.
   ``This success, however, has come at a cost much higher than that
of previous farm bills,'' the GAO said. ``Between fiscal years 1986
and 1988, farm price and income support programs averaged over $20
billion annually.''
   Farm programs should be designed to ``prevent the accumulation of
unneeded surpluses'' and still hold down the USDA's costs of
operating them, the report said.
   According to USDA budget figures, spending on farm commodity
supports soared to a record $25.8 billion in fiscal 1986, the first
year of operation under the 1985 law, but have declined since then.
   ``The 1985 farm bill moved farm programs in a more
market-oriented direction,'' the GAO said. ``However, rigidities in
the bill's production control provisions have discouraged farmers
from producing certain crops, even when commerical market conditions
are favorable.''
   For example, it said, the programs this year affected decisions
of farmers in the Corn Belt, who maintained their level of corn
plantings and did not expand their soybeans despite a strong soybean
market relative to corn.
   ``Increases in soybean acres may have improved market returns for
agriculture and tempered production expansion by foreign producers
who compete with U.S. farmers in world markets,'' the report said.
   Congress modified the law this year in response to the drought to
allow soybeans to be planted on corn acres in 1989 without farmers
losing future benefits under the corn program.
   ``The 1990 farm bill debate should focus on such alternatives
that retain USDA's ability to influence crop production but provide
more flexibility to respond to market opportunities,'' the report
said.

   Canada, the world's second-largest country
sprawling across six time zones, forbids broadcasters from spreading
election results while polls remain open.
   That means election coverage starts at 8 p.m. local time in each
zone as the polls close, unlike the U.S. system where the Pacific
coast receives network coverage while voting continues.
   ``We've got six time zones; that's why we've got to be very
cautious,'' said Jacques Mackay of the federal Elections Canada
agency. ``Of course, it's very difficult today in the age of
comunications to limit it _ but it's still done.''
   Mackay said in a telephone interview from Ottawa that the law
prohibits broadcasters from talking about election results while
polls remain open in any particular time zone.
   ``It's still possible to phone somebody in the East and say,
`What's going on?''' Bazay said.
   The majority of Canada's population lives in Quebec and Ontario,
which are on Eastern Standard Time. Those two provinces account for
10.7 million of the 17.5 million voters registered for Monday's
election and 174 of the 295 seats in the House of Commons.
   That leads to complaints from those who live farther west,
especially British Columbia, which has 32 seats, where polls close
three hours later.
   ``It's very simple,'' David Bazay, executive producer of the
public Canadian Broadcasting Corp.'s network news, said when asked
to explain the system. ``We do it every day as a matter of course.
Our national news basically has five editions.''
   Election programming for Newfoundland, where polls close at 6:30
p.m. EST, can start in the central studio in Toronto and be
broadcast regionally. The Atlantic Coast of Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island is added an hour later, then
Quebec and Ontario.
   ``We have a network. We can put the entire national network
together, or parts of it together,'' Bazay said. ``As the polls
close across the country, we simply put on election coverage. ...
It's not complicated at all.''
   The private Canadian TV network also was planning coverage
starting at 8 p.m. local time. Global was not starting its coverage
until about 10:15 p.m., after the conclusion of a National Hockey
League game between St. Louis and Toronto.
   Satellite and cable television are increasingly available to
Canadian households. Pierre Pontbriand, spokesman for the Canadian
Radio and Television Commission, said it was the responsibility of
each satellite and cable licensee to comply with the election law.

   A coastal Georgia town has regained its
honor as the home of the Brunswick stew champions of the world.
   Two local women reclaimed the stew championship this weekend in a
spoon-to-spoon battle with the dreaded enemy from Brunswick County,
Va.
   Lisa Cook and Fran Kelly, restaurant partners from nearby St.
Simons Island, won top honors in the latest battle in the ``Stew
Wars'' between Brunswick, Ga., and the Virginia county, both of
which claim to be the birthplace of Brunswick stew.
   ``The honor of Georgia has been very successfully defended on the
Brunswick stew battlefield,'' said Phyllis Taunton of Main Street
Brunswick, a sponsor of Saturday's stew-cooking contest.
   Last year, Virginians swept the first Brunswick stew cookoff,
held in Virginia and judged by an all-Virginia panel of judges.
   Georgians have contended since then that the Virginia contest was
rigged. Saturday's contest, on the other hand, was fair, Mrs.
Taunton said.
   Why?
   The judges were three Georgians: Atlanta TV personality Leroy
Powell, Atlanta chef and author Nathalie Dupree and Missy
Castleberry McDavid, of the Castleberry Foods family in Augusta.
   Mrs. Taunton said the fact that George Daniels of Alberta, Va.,
and Bill Denton of Richmond took second and third places in the
professional ``stewmaster'' category proved that the contest was on
the level.
   For the uninitiated, Brunswick stew is a spicy concoction of
smoked meat, chicken, corn, tomatoes and other ingredients.

   Women will have 50 percent more restrooms
than men in new public buildings in Virginia, as officialdom tries
to compensate for the different lengths of time the sexes spend in
the bathroom.
   Jack Rollison of the House of Delegates proposed the ``potty
parity'' revision to the state building code after a study showed
that women take longer in restrooms and are forced to wait in lines
to use the facilities at sporting events and theaters. The study
said women take more time because they frequently are accompanied by
small children and because they wear more clothes than men.
   The State Housing and Community Development Board voted Saturday
to increase the required number of women's restrooms in public
places by 50 percent, effective March 1. The provision will apply
only to new construction of large public gathering places such as
sports arenas and movie theaters. Men's and women's restrooms are
currently required to be built in an even ratio.
   ``I'm pleased they made the change,'' Rollison said. ``I think
this will open some new doors for women in the commonwealth.''

   After 15 years as a grade-school teacher, Bob
Anton made a quantum career change that is letting him look forward
to a winter with little more to do than tinker with his river boat.
   Last spring, Anton, 42, left teaching for the opportunity of his
dreams: to captain the brand new $1.8 million Spirit of Peoria
paddlewheeler.
   ``I liked teaching and I thought I would really miss it when
September rolled around. I was afraid I'd drive by a school
playground full of kids and really be drawn to it. But that hasn't
happened,'' said Anton, whose deeply etched face, bushy mustache and
tousled hair make him resemble an earlier river boat captain, Mark
Twain.
   Instead of spending nine months fantasizing about the river,
Anton is now living his dream in a pilot house.
   ``This is my favorite place,'' he said, looking down on the
wind-whipped Illinois River and the Peoria skyline.
   ``I look at the boat as a time machine. While everyone else in
the world is moving around at fast speed, we go up and down the
river at five miles per hour. You really go back in time when you go
out on a boat.''

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Canadian Jewish groups Monday began
fighting a proposal that would accept only Orthodox conversions to
Judaism and limit converts who can immigrate to Israel.
   Four U.S congressmen who met with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
said adopting the so-called ``Who is a Jew'' amendment would hurt
U.S.-Israeli relations.
   About 800 Israelis demonstrated against the amendment Monday as
the newly elected parliament convened for the first time. ``Don't
divide our people,'' read their posters.
   Rep. Matthew McHugh, D-N.Y., told reporters the proposal ``would
engender some strains which would not be healthy for the
U.S.-Israeli relationship.''
   His congressional delegation, organized by the U.S.-based
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, was one of three U.S. and
Canadian Jewish groups lobbying in Israel against the amendment.
   It would give Orthodox rabbis exclusive authority to approve
conversions to Judaism. This means Jewish converts would be granted
automatic Israeli citizenship under the ``Law of Return'' only if
brought into the faith by Orthodox rabbis.
   Ultra-Orthodox political parties are demanding the change as a
price for supporting either the right-wing Likud bloc or
left-leaning Labor party. The 18 parliament seats they won in Nov. 1
elections may give them the power o choose who heads the next
government.
   The amendment is fiercely opposed by Reform and Conservative Jews
whose branches make up the majority of Jews in the United States and
Canada.
   ``We are dealing with 5 million American Jews. This law would
make them feel like second-class citizens,'' said Martin Stein,
chairman of the trustees' board of the United Jewish Appeal, a major
American Jewish fund-raiser.
   Richard Cohen, a spokesman for the New York-based American Jewish
Committee, said after meeting Likud politicians that Israel should
not risk alienating U.S. Jews.
   ``American Jews see Israel as an extension of ourselves. If the
law is imposed on us, we will wonder if we are welcome in the State
of Israel,'' said Cohen.
   Peres told reporters he assured the congressmen that his Labor
Party would vote against the proposed change even though it involves
only a few foreign converts and does not affect most of Israel's 3.5
million Jews, who are Orthodox but non-observant.
   ``I believe it's not terribly important for Israel,'' said Peres.
``But it's very meaningful to American Jewry.''
   But Likud legislator Ehud Olmert said American Jews wanting to
affect policy should immigrate.
   ``If you want to change Israel, (you) should come over here and
fight through political channels,'' he told members of the American
Jewish Committee.
   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek, returning from a weeklong trip to
the United States, told a news conference American Jews were so
angry he feared changing the law could permanently damage
U.S.-Israel relations.
   Some have threatened to donate money to American Jewish causes or
private Israeli charities instead of directly to Israel, he said.
   Kollek said the controversy could also affect the U.S.
government's 3 billion dollars in annual foreign aid to Israel.
   ``If you don't have a united Jewish community, it is very
doubtful if on its own the (U.S.) administration will keep up the
level of gifts,'' he warned.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc, which narrowly
defeated Labor but failed to win an absolute majority in the
elections, has agreed to support the ``Who is a Jew'' legislation in
exchange for the backing of four religious parties in a Likud-led
government.
   But the American campaign, added to pressure from liberal
Israelis, could prompt Shamir and Peres to join together in a
coalition that would blunt the influence of ultra-Orthodox parties.

   A television reporter who was elected Ohio
County surveyor by write-in votes says he has no intention of
carrying out the duties of his office. In fact, he isn't even sure
what they are.
   ``It was a lark,'' said Donald Wayne Ullom, a reporter for
WTOV-TV of nearby Steubenville, Ohio. ``I'm flattered.''
   Ullom won the Nov. 8 election with 28 write-in votes. Write-in
votes also were cast for 27 other people.
   No one filed to run for the office. But several people warned
Ullom they would write his name on the ballot.
   ``They could have written in anybody's name,'' Ullom said. ``By
some quirk of the imagination, more people wrote in my name.''
   Ullom, who uses the name Donald Wayne on the air, said he has no
surveying experience. But that's OK because the job has no duties
and no salary.
   ``In some counties they use the office,'' said Ohio County
Administrator Tom Samol. ``Here, God, I can't even remember the last
time we used it.
   ``I believe some counties use the office, but what for, I
couldn't really tell you.''
   Donald Bartholomew served as Ohio County surveyor from 1978 to
1984.
   ``Nobody's used it. No one's ever done anything with it,''
Bartholomew said. ``There's no salary unless you negotiate with the
Ohio County Commission. There's no qualifications.''
   The state code requires the county surveyor to be called upon
``if there is to be a change in county line. The county commission
should order a survey of the entire county to be included in the new
county.''
   ``It's sort of an archaic position,'' said Gene Adkins, executive
director of the West Virginia Association of Counties. ``There's no
salary. They're not provided with anything. In a few counties, the
county commission gives them a little office.''
   Ullom said he has no intention of even taking the oath of office
before a judge or notary public.
   ``I didn't run for the office,'' Ullom said.

<TEXT>
   Two men have been arrested in the theft of a
shipment of about $1 million worth of jewelry, much of which was
found buried in a cracker tin in New Hampshire, a federal prosecutor
said Monday.
   Carroll Hiscock Wade Jr., 26, formerly of Conway, N.H., was
arrested by the FBI in Anchorage, Alaska, on Nov. 15 and indicted
the same day on a charge of interstate transportation of stolen
property, acting U.S. Attorney Peter Papps said.
   Ralph Hernandez, 26, was picked up by the FBI in Los Angeles the
same day and charged with stealing from an interstate shipment,
Papps said.
   Both men were to appear before U.S. magistrates for bail hearings
in the cities where they were arrested, and the case will be heard
in Anchorage.
   The FBI opened an investigation in Anchorage after 136 loose
diamonds and 105 gold rings were stolen from a Federal Express
shipment in March, Papps said. The jewelry was being sent from an
Indianapolis jewelry store to Anchorage.
   Ninety-two diamonds and 84 gold rings, valued at about $850,000,
were recovered in June buried in a cracker tin in a forest in
Conway, where Wade lived until several years ago, Papps said. He
declined to say how authorities learned where the jewelry was buried
or disclose more about the investigation.
   Additional items were recovered in Alaska, and some jewelry still
is missing, he said.

   An Israeli soldier disciplined for unruly
behavior opened fire near a commander's office Monday, killing an
officer and wounding another soldier before committing suicide, army
officials said.
   Pvt. Yitzhak Kalfon apparently was upset because a disciplinary
court had sentenced him to 21 days in a military prison, said the
officials, who insisted on anonymity.
   Killed was Lt. Yair Levy, reported to be a commander in the unit
in which Kalfon served but not Kalfon's direct supervisor.
   The state-run Itim news agency said Kalfon, a cook at a southern
Israel army base, was informed of the court's ruling Monday. The
army said he was disciplined for unruly behavior, but would not
elaborate.
   Kalfon took a M-16 assault rifle from the armory and ran toward
the commander's office, Itim said.
   ``He came into the office breathing deeply and sprayed the gun in
every direction,'' Itim quoted a lieutenant colonel as saying. He
was not identified by name in keeping with military regulations.
   The lieutenant colonel said Levy tried to escape to a nearby room
but was struck by a bullet that penetrated the door.
   The woman soldier, struck in the left arm, was identified as
Perla Yudovsky.
   The army would not give the exact location of base for security
reasons.
   Military police launched an investigation into the incident, the
officials said.

   A 12-year-old boy started classes at
a private school Monday, eight months after he quit his public
school because he was taunted and beaten by classmates who derided
his dark skin and hair.
   ``It's great to be able to attend school again,'' said Sean
Pagano, a Sephardic Jew, when he arrived at the Liberal Jewish Day
School in West Hempstead, on Long Island, where he was offered a
free education.
   He was welcomed by eight students from the school who were on
board the bus that picked him up.
   ``It's cool that he's here,'' said fellow student Stephanie
Mitchell. ``But it was unfair the way he got here.''
   Pagano has been out kept out of school by his parents since last
March because he was beaten by students in Massapequa who made fun
of his dark skin and jet black hair.
   His story gained attention after Massapequa school officials
threatened to take Pagano's parents to court to force their son to
return to school.
   Headmaster Samuel Briedner said the board of directors at the
Liberal Jewish Day School agreed to waive the $3,700 tuition for
Pagano. But since last week, several people have offered to pay his
way.
   Briedner said most contributions came from non-Jews.

   Dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov will make his

   The Franz Kafka story about a man who turns into an insect was

   Baryshnikov, whose film credits include ``The Turning Point'' and
``White Nights,'' will make his stage debut in the play, co-produced
by Roger Stevens and Lars Schmidt.
   Kumin said he was approached by producers because Baryshnikov
wanted a ``less traditional, more relaxed'' setting for his debut.

   Stormie received her donated heart and liver Feb. 14, 1984. She

   American Jewish leaders are suggesting that
President-elect George Bush appoint a Jew or other strong supporter
of Israel to a top post in an administration they see as taking
shape without a voice for Israel.
   The appointment of John Sununu, the New Hampshire governor of
Lebanese descent who will be Bush's chief-of-staff, concerned some
Jewish leaders. And other appointments have not assuaged that
concern, they indicated Monday.
   ``None of them come to their posts with a clear message of
heartfelt identification with Israel's security needs,'' said Hyman
Bookbinder, formerly the Washington representative of the American
Jewish Committee and still a leading lobbyist for Jewish and Israeli
causes.
   ``None of this is meant to imply that Bush is anti-Israel,''
added Bookbinder, who campaigned on behalf of Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis.
   American Jewish leaders consider the Reagan administration,
including Secretary of State George Shultz, the most pro-Israel
administration ever.
   Bush ran on a strong pro-Israel platform but was viewed in the
past with suspicion by Jewish leaders for advocating an increase in
Saudi oil prices and for supporting some arms sales to Arab nations.
   Bookbinder and others, who echoed his sentiments but declined to
be named, suggested that Bush appoint a Jewish or pro-Israel Cabinet
member or U.N. ambassador.
   Among the names mentioned were those of Morris Abram, the
chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organization; Max Kampelman, the arms negotiator, and Richard
Schifter, assistant secretary of state for human rights.
   Abram, a conservative Georgia Democrat who campaigned for Reagan
and Bush, has also served Presidents Kennedy and Carter on civil and
human rights projects. Abram, a partner in a New York law firm, said
he had not been contacted ``but I would be willing to hear what the
president-elect has to say. I have great respect for him.''
   Also mentioned by several Jewish leaders was Jeanne Kirkpatrick,
who served as U.N. ambassador during the first years of the Reagan
administration and is viewed as a staunch ally of Israel.
   ``It doesn't have to be a Jew, but we need someone who will make
us feel better,'' Bookbinder said.
   Leaders of Jewish organizations are to meet Wednesday with Sununu
to voice their concerns about his record. ``We've never had an
Arab-American as gatekeeper to the president,'' said one leader
invited to the meeting. ``I think there's legitimate cause for
concern.''
   Sununu, whose grandfather was Lebanese, drew the ire of American
Jews as the only governor to decline to condemn a 1975 U.N.
resolution that equates Zionism with racism.
   Standing at Bush's side during a news conference announcing his
selection for the White House job, Sununu said last week he had not
wanted to involve his state in foreign affairs. Sununu said he
rejects the 1975 resolution and supports the pro-Israel platform of
the Republican Party, which he helped write.

<TEXT>
   The emerging Bush administration includes
prominent holdovers from the Reagan years, but with one clear and
important difference: The new team is tilted far more toward
pragmatists than ideologues.
   Bush filled three more key positions Monday and his choices were
sure to set off cries of anguish from the right.
   Dick Thornburgh will remain attorney general and Lauro Cavazos
will stay on as education secretary. Both men were late-comers to
the Reagan administration and both replaced leading ideologues,
Edwin Meese III and William Bennett.
   The third Bush choice was Richard Darman to serve as director of
the Office of Management and Budget.
   ``He's put together an Eastern establishment Republican
administration,'' said conservative activist Richard Viguerie.
``That's discouraging.''
   High-profile jobs in the next administration are rapidly being
filled, and only one Bush choice has drawn applause from
conservatives _ Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire who will serve as
White House chief of staff.
   The voting machines had hardly stopped humming with Bush's
40-state Election Day victory when the president-elect made the most
obvious choice for his new administration _ friend, adviser and
campaign chairman James A. Baker III to succeed George Shultz as
secretary of state.
   During his tenure as White House chief of staff Baker earned a
reputation as a quintessential pragmatist, a savvy insider who
repeatedly gave low priority to the initiatives of the more
ideological elements in the Reagan administration. Calls on Reagan
to fire Baker were always sure applause lines at conservative
gatherings.
   Baker's deputy was Darman.
   Quick to follow the Baker selection was that of another old Bush
friend and adviser, Nicholas Brady. He will remain treasury
secretary.
   In fact, another characteristic of the Bush appointees is how
many have long-standing ties to the president-elect.
   When Ronald Reagan was filling out his administration eight years
ago, he was meeting many of the top officials for the first time.
The same was true of Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976.
   Not so with Bush. His relationships with the people he has
appointed goes back many years.
   That should not be surprising, considering the years Bush has
served in governmental and party posts. The long resume he touted
during the presidential campaign put him in close contact with other
up-and-coming Republicans.
   No one ever described Bush as an ideologue and, clearly, the
people he feels most comfortable with are as pragmatic as he.
   It's always tough to get the jump on a new president and name his
Cabinet for him. But so far there have been no big surprises, no
choices from other than the names subject to the most speculation.
   The names being mentioned for the remaining national security
jobs are former Texas Sen. John Tower for Defense and Brent
Scowcroft for national security adviser or CIA director.
   Scowcroft was national security adviser to President Ford and is
an establishment figure.
   One conservative favorite whose name is frequently mentioned for
a Cabinet post is former New York Rep. Jack Kemp.
   But Kemp is most often mentioned as either Labor or Housing
secretary, the two areas where he is least-stringently ideological.
The former Buffalo congressman has always enjoyed good relations
with traditionally Democratic unions and his major urban initiative
is a proposal for enterprise zones to encourage businesses to locate
in neighborhoods with high unemployment.
   Neither post would make Kemp a major player in areas where his
more ideological views on monetary and tax policy would have
influence.
   Bush may yet come up with some appointees who will please
hard-line conservatives, but there is no sign of a Bennett, a James
Watt or a Donald Hodel waiting in the wings.

<HEAD>Malaysia Closing Down Vietnamese Refugee Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Malaysia will close a major camp
for Vietnamese boat people and will turn away all new arrivals, the
foreign minister said Monday.
   The government would announce the date once it finalized details
to shut down Pulau Bidong island camp, said Foreign Minister Abu
Hassan Omar.
   ``The island will be gazetted (declared) a prohibited area and
refugees arriving in Malaysia after that date will be turned away,''
he said after opening the Asia and Pacific Regional Seminar on
Refugees and Displaced Persons.
   Abu Hassan said rejecting the boat people formed the first phase
of the government's decision to close the camp, which now houses
about 12,900 refugees.
   The second phase, he said, was the final closure once all
refugees had been repatriated to their own country or resettled in
willing third countries.
   Pulau Bidong, an island 180 miles from Kuala Lumpur on the east
coast of Peninsular Malaysia, was turned into a refugee center after
the 1975 communist victory in Vietnam, when thousands of Vietnamese
fled to the shores of Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries.
   The government has spent about $26.23 million to maintain the
camp, Abu Hassan said.
   Addressing the seminar, he said Malaysia was not prepared to open
its doors to the boat people because they had abused the temporary
asylum provided them. He did not elaborate.
   He said more refugees had come to Malaysia between January and
September this year than throughout last year. There were 1,008
arrivals last month, he said.
   ``Until the principle of first asylum is correctly addressed by
the international community, the phenomena will one day be
remembered as a problem rather than a solution,'' Abu Hassan said.
   He called on Vietnam to prevent the illegal departure of its
people and to accept the return of those not selected for final
resettlement in third countries.

<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush should cancel some
weapons and look for other Pentagon savings as part of the effort to
control the defense budget, a congressional agency said Monday.
   The General Accounting Office, in one of a series of reports on
issues facing Bush when he takes office Jan. 20, noted that even
though ``each of the services says it needs many billions of dollars
more to complete its modernization and expansion programs,'' the
current $300 billion defense budget isn't likely to be increased for
the forseeable future.
   Current Pentagon plans include programs ``which would cost about
$200 billion more than the Defense Department can expect to
receive'' during the five-year period which ends in 1992, the
congressional watchdog agency said.
   Bush and the Democratic-controlled Congress need to take a number
of actions to reduce future defense expenditures, the GAO said.
Those include:
   _Reducing and realigning planned programs. ``In so doing, cancel

   One improvement would be in the Pentagon office which oversees
what is supposed to be the realistic testing of weapons, the GAO
said.
   The usefulness of the current testing system ``has been limited
because of insufficient resources to conduct testing, deferrel of
certain critical tests until after the production decision, failure
to simulate realistic battlefield conditions during testing and
acceptance of products which do not meet the test criteria,'' it
said.

   President-elect George Bush called his defeated

and suggested a meeting, according to Dukakis aides.
   Bush telephoned Dukakis in his Statehouse office, and the two men
spoke briefly, said Martha Barnes, a spokeswoman for the governor.
   She said the vice president ``extended an invitation'' for the
two men to meet. ``The governor wants to do it. They just have to
work out the details. We don't know where or when,'' she said.
   In Washington, Bush told reporters he had no plans for a
Thanksgiving weekend with his defeated Democratic opponent but liked
the idea of meeting him ``and I might just pick up the phone any one

   ``I don't want to have a lot of show business. I want to hold out
my hand and say, `Look, the campaign is behind us,''' Bush said.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer chip maker has adopted a strict
no-smoking policy in its Texas plants in a policy shift that some
predict will sweep the U.S. semiconductor industry.
   The new rules, which take effect Jan. 2, apply to all Texas
employees of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. _ 2,200 in Austin and 900
in San Antonio.
   ``It's kind of a pilot project in Texas,'' said David Frink, a
local spokesman for the California-based company.
   The company plans to remove ash trays and cigarette machines and
has encouraged workers to join smoking cessation classes, designed
by the American Cancer Society.
   Employees previously were allowed to smoke in designated areas,
although never in the ``clean rooms'' where delicate computer chips
are made.
   Frink said the company revised its smoking policy to eliminate a
potential source of chip-destroying contaminants. A speck of dust or
smoke particle can block part of a microscopic circuit and ruin a
chip.
   He said it also responds to recent evidence linking nonsmokers'
health hazards to second-hand smoke.
   The company chose Texas for the experiment because its operations
are smaller here than in California, Frink told the Austin
American-Statesman. In addition, chips made in Texas are among its
most sensitive.
   Other chipmakers predicted more companies would follow suit.
   Stan Victor, a spokesman for Texas Instruments in Dallas, said
the company discourages smoking but has not yet gone as far as
Advanced Micro Devices.
   Texas Instruments offers smoking cessation classes to employees
and their spouses, Victor said, and asks clean room employees who
smoke during breaks to rinse their mouths with water and wait at
least five minutes before re-entering the chip-making area.
   Scott Wyman, a spokesman for International Business Machines
Corp., said the company has banned smoking in some of its newer
manufacturing buildings. But it allows designated smoking areas in
compliance with an Austin ordinance.
   The manager of contamination engineering for Sematech, Keith
Dillenbeck, said Advanced Micro Devices' policy likely will spread
through the industry.
   ``There is a trend in that direction,'' Dillenbeck said.
   Dillenbeck said technical journals have indicated smoke can
linger in the mouth and lungs, as well as cling to clothes and hair,
as long as two hours after smoking.
   As a result, he said, smokers in the clean room may generate as
many as 10 times more particles than non-smokers.

   Twenty-five Harlem first-graders were told Monday
that they will be assured of money for college if they finish high
school, and they declared: ``We are the happiest children in the
world.''
   The potential members of the class of the year 2000 are
beneficiaries of the ``ScholarshipBuilder'' program of Merrill Lynch
& Co. and the National Urban League.
   ``You may not fully understand the significance of this,''
Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins told the 6-yeremony at their
school, Rafael Hernandez-Langston Hughes
Elementary. ``But with an education you can be anything you want to
ear-olds in a
cbe.''
   The program, underwritten by the Merrill Lynch Foundation, will
provide the 25 children here and an additional 225 in nine other
cities full college tuition or cash incentives if they don't drop
out.
   The other cities are Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Houston,
Los Angeles, Miami, Washington and Philadelphia.
   Private college tuition when the first graders are ready to enter
will average about $17,500 per year, by foundation estimate.
Students who elect to skip college and get a job or join the Army
after high school will get a one-time $1,000 payment for clothes and
travel expenses.
   Asked what she wanted to be when she grew up, 6-year-old Ashley
Lightbourn replied: ``Maybe a doctor.'' But mLorain

   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated

since he was kidnapped March 16, 1985, from a Beirut street.
   The committee must receive cards at P.O. Box 391, Lorain, by Dec.
8 so they can be shipped to Lebanon in time for Christmas. Rep.
Donald Pease, D-Ohio, is handling arrangements to mail the cards and
letters to Lebanon, the group said.
   The effort is being cheered by Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, now
of Cadiz, Ky. Such a campaign, she said, demonstrates to both her
brother and the federal government that the hostages will not be
forgotten.
   ``Everybody I've talked with, and that's an awful lot of people,
said the thing we need to do is keep the issue alive. Certainly,
Christmas cards are a way to do that,'' Mrs. Say said.

   A man who once sued entertainer Liberace for
palimony was placed on three years' probation Monday and credited
with time already served in jail for his role in a series of
drug-related robberies.
   Scott Alan Thorson, 31, who described his homosexual relationship
with the late Liberace in a recent book, also was sentenced to a
year in the county jail, but the judge credited him with the 348
days he's already spent in custody.
   Thorson pleaded guilty in July to one count of robbery for his
role in a ring prosecutors said staged a series of violent
drug-related robberies. He is awaiting trial on an unrelated charge
of receiving stolen property.
   Thorson lived in Liberace's Las Vegas home and worked as
bodyguard and servant before the flamboyant entertainer died last
year of complications of AIDS.
   The palimony lawsuit Thorson brought against Liberace, claiming
the dancer had an ``intimate sexual and emotional relationship''
with the entertainer, was dismissed in May 1983. A Superior Court
judge ruled there were no grounds for Thorson to make claims for
support payments from the pianist.

   George Bush's three holdover Cabinet appointees
won't face a second round of Senate confirmation hearings thanks to
a ruling 60 years ago on then-Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon,
Senate officials said Monday.
   Bush has asked Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady to
stay in their jobs in his new administration.
   All three men have joined the Reagan administration since August,
and all experienced no problems being confirmed by a majority of the
Senate.
   Michael Davidson, the Senate's legal counsel, said they wouldn't
have to undergo the confirmation process next year _ unless Bush
wanted them to. If he did, the men would formally resign, only to be
re-nominated by Bush.
   That won't happen, Bush's transition aides said.
   ``We're following the precedent that we think was wisely ...
followed by Martin Van Buren, who did not submit his nominees that
were held over for reconfirmation,'' said Craig Fuller, co-director
of Bush's transition office.
   Since George Washington's time there have been cases of Cabinet
appointees remaining in office over the span of more than one
president, according to Davidson, the Senate's legal counsel.
   For example, Secretary of State Timothy Pickering served both
Washington and John Adams without separate confirmation hearings, he
said.
   But the practice was tested in 1929 when a Senate Judiciary
Committee panel investigated the case of Mellon, a Republican
financier who was treasury secretary in the Harding, Coolidge and
Hoover administrations, Davidson said.
   ``This was undertaken in the case of Mellon but it is applicable
to Thornburgh, Cavazos and Brady,'' he said.
   Six decades ago, the senators concluded Cabinet appointees need
not face additional Senate confirmation rounds because there was no
statute limiting their terms, Davidson said.
   ``They (the members of the Senate) were of the opinion such
officials could remain in office indefinitely,'' he said, at the
pleasure of the president.
   If the Senate wanted to require new confirmation hearings on
holdover appointments at the end of an administration, it would have
to pass a law on that subject, Davidson said.
   Two days after Bush was elected on Nov. 8, President Reagan
ordered all his appointees to submit their resignations in a timely
fashion.
   Bush's decision to name the holdover Cabinet people obviously
signals that Reagan will not accept resignations from Thornburgh,
Brady and Cavazos, according to Melinda Kitchell, a spokeswoman for
the Education Department.

   The discovery of a bloodstained mattress
in a motel has led police in Connecticut and Georgia to begin a
murder investigation, although authorities said Monday no body has
been recovered.
   A maid entered Room 12 at the Starlight Motel in East Lyme near
the Connecticut shoreline about noon last Friday to find that a
mattress that ``had been stained with a large quantity of blood,''
state police said in a statement.
   Two men riding in a gray or silver Cadillac with a Georgia
registration had checked into the motel room on Nov. 15 for several
days, and left before the discovery, state police said.
   Police said they are working on the case with the Georgia Bureau
of Investigation, issuing a nationwide alert in an effort to find
the men.
   State police said they are not aware of any missing person's
report that might have been linked to the incident.
   Marcy Stamm, a state police spokeswoman, said no weapon was found
in the room. She said police would not comment on other evidence
that led them to conclude a crime had occurred.

<TEXT>
   Women are starting to smoke earlier in life,
smoking more and inhaling more deeply than they did in the 1960s,
according to surveys by the American Cancer Society.
   The incidence of lung cancer in women increased five-fold during
that time, from an average of 24 cases per 100,000 women in
1960-1964 to 131 per 100,000 between 1982 and 1986, the cancer
society said.
   The number of women who smoke 20 or more cigarettes a day climbed
by 20 percent between 1960-1964 _ when the cancer society conducted
its first Cancer Prevention Survey _ and 1982-1986, when it
conducted the Cancer Prevention Survey II.
   The results of the latest survey, in which 619,225 women were
given questionnaires, appear in the Dec. 1 issue of the scientific
journal Cancer Research.
   The survey also found that more women have quit smoking, and that
there is actually a drop in smoking rates in women under age 45.
   ``If trends continue, this will be followed by a similar
downtrend in women's lung cancer rates,'' said Lawrence Garfinkel,
one of the authors of the study.

<HEAD>Soviet Men Increase Lead, Hungarian Women Share First Place</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union defeated Yugoslavia
2.5-1.5 and increased its lead to three points in the eighth round
of the Chess Olympiad on Monday.
   In the women's compeition, the Hungarian team moved up to share
first place with the Soviets.
   The Soviet men's team has 24{ points out of a possible 32. The
United States crushed Norway 3{-{ and moved up to share second place
with Sweden, which its match with Cuba 2-2.
   The Soviet men won their match when World Champion Garri Kasparov
defeated Ljubomir Ljubojevic of Yugosalvia with the black pieces. In
the competition so far, Kasparov has won five games and conceded
only one draw.
   Yasser Seirawan of Seattle led the United States to victory when
he defeated Siemen Agdestein, the Norwegian champion who also is a
member of his country's national soccer team.
   The other U.S. victories came from Grandmasters Joel Benjamin, of
the New York borough of Brooklyn, and Larry Christiansen from the
New York borough of Queens.
   ``We've finally hit our form and if we play our best from now on
we will have reasonable chances to battle for a medal,'' said
International Master John Donaldson, the U.S. captain, also from
Seattle.
   ``We still have three tough matches against the Soviet Union,
England and Hungary and they will play a large part in determining
the final standings,'' Donaldson said.
   A win scores one point and a draw a half. The adjourned games
will be completed Tuesday, and the ninth round will follow, with the
United States likely to be paired against the Soviet Union.
   At the last Olympiad in 1986, the United States defeated the
Soviet Union 2{-1{ after Seirawan scored a sensational victory over
Kasparov. The Soviets went on to win the gold medals, with England
second and the United States third.
   East Germany is in fourth place after scoring 2-1 against West
Germany with one game adjourned. The East Germans, competing in
their first Olympiad for 16 years are expected to at least draw this
unfinished game and win the match.
   England, the second seeds, bounced back to share fifth place by
defeating Switzerland 3{-{.
   It was joined in fifth place by Hungary, the Netherlands,
Philippines and Denmark, who wiped out Scotland 4-0.
   In the women's championship, Hungary came back into contention
for the gold medals by destroying Czechoslovakia 3-0, while the
Soviet Union only drew 1{-1{ with Poland. Both teams have 19 points
out of 24.
   The Soviet domination in the women's Olympiad is threatened by
three remarkable Hungarian sisters led by Judit Polgar, the
highest-ranked 12-year-old in history.
   While the three won their eighth round games against
Czechoslovakia, the Soviet women lost their lead when Hanna Erenska
of Poland defeated Soviet Grandmaster Irina Levitina.
   The Chess Olympiad, held in Greece's second city located 300
miles north of Athens, is a biennial world team championship.
Organized by the 127-member World Chess Federation, the month-long
competition features teams representing 106 nations.
   The 14th and final round is scheduled for Nov. 29.

<HEAD>States Go To Court With EPA Again Over Acid Rain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine states filed a new lawsuit Monday against
the Environmental Protection Agency in their 5-year legal effort to
force the agency to order new acid rain controls in the Midwest.
   The states, joined by the National Audubon Society, asked the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review
EPA's refusal to act on their petition seeking those controls.
   That petition called on EPA to publish for public comment the
determination of the Carter administration's EPA chief that sulfur
dioxide emissions from the United States were harming Canada. Such a
publication is the first step in drafting a regulation.
   The Canadian province of Ontario and two environmental
organizations filed a similar lawsuit in the same court on Nov. 1.
   A few days before leaving office in January 1981, EPA
Administrator Douglas Costle wrote Secretary of State Edmund Muskie
that these emissions were harming Canada by being transformed in the
atmosphere into sulfuric acid, which falls as acid rain in eastern
Canada.
   Many of these sulfur dioxide emissions originate in the U.S.
Midwest in power plant and factory smokestacks.
   Once such a determination is made, U.S. law requires EPA to order
affected states to revise their air pollution control plans to
eliminate the offending emissions. But the appeals court, in a
decision upheld by the Supreme Court, ruled earlier that a letter to
the secretary of state was not formal enough, and any such
determination had to be made in formal proceedings leading to a
regulation.
   Ontario, the nine states and various environmental groups all
petitioned for such formal proceedings, but EPA in October said it
would not act on those petitions because it still did not know
enough to tell states in the Midwest how to revise their air
pollution control measures.
   Environmentalists say acid rain has made hundreds of lakes in the
Adirondack Mountains of New York State unlivable for fish. Canada
says 14,000 lakes in the eastern half of that country have been
damaged.
   David Wooley, an assistant attorney general of New York State,
one of the plaintiff states, said in Albany, N.Y., the states are
entitled to sue because they are harmed by the same pollutant
harming Canada. He said he has asked that his lawsuit be
consolidated with Ontario's.
   In addition to New York, the plaintiff states are the six New
England states, New Jersey and Minnesota.

   President-elect George Bush reached again into
the Reagan Cabinet Monday to retain Dick Thornburgh as attorney
general and Lauro F. Cavazos as secretary of education. He also
named former White House aide Richard G. Darman for ``perhaps the
most difficult job,'' budget director.
   Thornburgh and Cavazos, like Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady, were late additions to the Reagan team. Bush told a news
conference that ``in all likelihood'' those three will be the only
direct holdovers.
   They join James A. Baker III, the former treasury secretary whom
Bush has chosen to be secretary of state, as cornerstone members of
Bush's new Cabinet. The president-elect said Monday, ``I will keep
my commitment to bring in lots of new faces.''
   Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire, named as Bush's new chief of
staff last week, said at a Republican governors conference in Point
Clear, Ala., ``I think the next thing you'll see, probably after
Thanksgiving, is the focus shift a little bit to the defense side, a
little rounding out of that team, and then rounding out of some of
the other major areas.''
   Bush swore in Cavazos, 61, the first Hispanic-American to serve
in a Cabinet, in September as successor to William Bennett at the
Department of Education. Bush had promised to appoint a Hispanic to
his own Cabinet if elected.
   Thornburgh, 56, former governor of Pennsylvania and onetime head
of the Department of Justice's criminal division, replaced the
embattled Edwin Meese III in August. Bush said Thornburgh's priority
as the nation's chief law enforcement officer will be ``combatting
the scourge of drugs.''
   ``Drugs are Public Enemy No. 1. A major part of Dick's mission
will be to stop them from damaging our society and our country,''
said the president-elect.
   Darman, 45, was deputy White House chief of staff and then deputy
treasury secretary under Baker before taking a job with an
investment firm last year. He has worked in six Cabinet agencies:
Defense, Justice, Commerce, State, Treasury and Health, Education
and Welfare.
   Bush also got some private advice Monday from former Presidents
Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, who headed a commission that has made
recommendations for the next administration.
   He later telephoned the man he defeated in the Nov. 8 election,
Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts. Dukakis aides said
the two men spoke briefly about getting together but no date was set.
   ``I don't want to have a lot of show business. I want to hold out
my hand and say, `Look, the campaign is behind us,''' Bush said at a
brief news conference following his appointment announcements.
   At the news conference, Bush rejected a General Accounting Office
report that dismissed his ``flexible freeze'' proposal for cutting
the budget deficit. The report said that tax increases as well as
military and Social Security cuts would have to be considered.
   ``I'm not going to change my view as to how we get this deficit
down,'' Bush said. ``I don't remember any Republicans or Democrats
running on a please-raise-my-taxes program.''
   Darman, named to take over at the Office of Management and
Budget, defended the flexible freeze, saying only Social Security
was exempt from its stringencies. He singled out medical programs as
a prime target for savings in the Bush administration.
   He said medical costs have been rising at two to three times the
general rate of inflation for a couple of decades. ``Just getting
the costs in that area under control is a big challenge, but it's
also a big reward in terms of budget savings,'' Darman said.
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., a senior member
of the Senate Budget Committee, said that in proscribing new taxes
and exempting Social Security from cuts, Darman was administering
``just another dose of politics, of `read my lips' and other
absolutist statements. ... They are not going to work.''
   Bush flies to Houston Tuesday for two hours of meetings with
President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, who takes
office Dec. 1. The vice president will stop on the way in Point
Clear, Ala., at a Republican governors conference.
   He said he would make clear in his meeting with Salinas ``that I
am committed to democracy in Central America.'' He said the
Sandinista government of Nicaragua has been ``unwilling to take the
steps towards democracy that I find absolutely essential if we are
going to have harmony in Central America.''
   Bush also was asked Monday about his meeting next month with
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   He said he would not make any commitments on ``arms control or
anything else'' when he sees Gorbachev. It will be ``President
Reagan's meeting. I will be there as vice president of the United
States and I expect they'll be aware they're talking to the next
president,'' he said.
   As for his appointees, Bush said he had spelled out for both
Thornburgh and Cavazos ``certain objectives,'' and would ``work in a
hands-on fashion with the members of the Cabinet after I am sworn
in.''
   On the budget, Bush said Darman ``understands the numbers'' and
``will make sure the Bush administration hits the ground running''
in trying to reduce the federal deficit.
   Bush said he has not decided whether he will send Congress after
his inauguration a complete revision of the fiscal 1990 budget that
Reagan will submit in January as one of his last acts.
   Asked by reporters what happened to the rumored appointment of
Stanford economist Michael J. Boskin as chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers, Bush replied crisply, ``Nothing happened. Just
don't believe all the leaks you read in the newspapers.''
   Craig Fuller, co-director of the transition, said, ``We have a
high regard for him. We're still working on the chairman's
appointment.''

   Texas Rangers and Mexican trackers threaded
their way across 400-foot cliffs Monday looking for clues left by
snipers who shot at a Rio Grande rafting party and killed a man
trying to drag his wounded wife to safety.
   Up to four snipers were believed responsible for the Saturday
ambush on the river in which the couple's river guide also was
wounded. He and the woman were hospitalized in stable condition
Monday.
   ``The woman said she remembered seeing some smoke coming from the
high bluff on the Mexican side of the river ... and that moments
later, shots were fired and bullets hit on either side of their
raft,'' said Mike Cox, a spokesman for the Texas Department of
Public Safety in Austin. ``The woman says it was a nightmare.
   ``There was no provocation or anything. It was just an attack.''
   Cox said it was the second time this year that American tourists
have reported being shot at from the cliffs on Mexico's side of the
Rio Grande.
   Officials believe between 20 and 30 shots were fired, Cox said.
Searchers found 12 shell casings Sunday on the cliffs in an area
reachable only by boat or helicopter and once notorious for its
marijuana cultivation.
   The three were rafting down the river outside Big Bend National
Park in southwestern Texas when they were fired at about noon
Saturday.
   Guide Jim Burr had led Michael W. Heffley and his wife, Jamie, of
Eastland, down two miles of their planned 12-mile trip in the rented
14-foot inflatable raft when the shooting began.
   Mrs. Heffley thought at least two people were on the bluff but
Burr said he saw four, Cox said.
   Burr was shot in the right thigh, but was able to maneuver the
raft ashore. When the gunfire continued, he and the Heffleys moved
downriver. After they pulled ashore again, Mrs. Heffley was shot
when they got out of the raft, authorities said.
   Heffley, 40, was shot in the back and killed while he tried to
help his wife to safety, Cox said.
   Mrs. Heffley and Burr hid in brush, and Burr set out for help
after dark, authorities said. He was spotted by a rancher Sunday
morning.
   When the three failed to arrive at a pickup point Saturday night,
the rafting company sent another raft to look for them. The rescue
crew found the raft and other equipment with numerous bullet holes,
and contacted authorities.
   U.S. Border Patrol and Customs helicopters were sent out early
Sunday and their crews spotted Heffley's body near the river after
daybreak, Cox said. When the helicopters landed, Mrs. Heffley came
out of brush where she had been hiding, he added.
   Steve Harris, co-owner of Far Flung Adventures, said the trio had
started their trip at Rancherias Creek in Presidio County and were
supposed to have gone on to Grassy Bank, a 12-mile trip by river but
40 miles by road.
   The attack occurred in a canyon at a point where the river is 50
to 60 yards wide, he said.
   Heffley was a sales manager for Big State X-Ray, owned by Wade
Penn of Chickasha, Okla. Penn said he and wife, Dolly, were supposed
to join the Heffleys for the trip to Big Bend.
   ``Mike had gone down a couple of weeks ago. He thought it was
such a beautiful area,'' Mrs. Penn said. ``He had taken a motorcycle
trip for a chili cookoff. He thought it was such a pretty area that
he wanted Jamie to see it.''
   Mrs. Heffley, 32, and Burr, 36, were hospitalized in stable
condition in Alpine, 80 miles from the shooting scene.

<HEAD>Health, Economics Issues in Kentucky Smoking Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK R. CHELLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers in Kentucky, the nation's leading
tobacco producer, are pressuring the University of Louisville to
drop its plan to restrict smoking, days after a government report
showed the state had the nation's highest smoking-related death rate.
   The chairman of the state House agriculture committee said Monday
that the controversy over designated non-smoking areas at the
university is about economics and individual rights, not about
health.
   But supporters of segregating smokers said that health is the
overriding concern and that they are not enemies of the tobacco
industry in a state where it accounts for an estimated 54,000 jobs
and where burley tobacco is the No. 1 cash crop with $451 million in
sales last year.
   The dispute grew out of the university's consideration of a
policy to ban smoking in classrooms, reception areas and elevators
and to permit smoking only in designated areas of most other
buildings.
   Members of the General Assembly's Tobacco Task Force reacted by
threatening to cut the university's budget.
   ``I don't think we're fighting for the tobacco industry, or the
tobacco farmer. We're talking about people's rights here,'' said
Rep. Clay Crupper, chairman of the Agriculture and Natural Resources
Committee.
   Crupper said it sends a bad signal to the rest of the country
when Kentucky joins the list of places where tobacco is under attack.
   At a meeting in Owensboro late Sunday, Crupper first called on
the task-force members to approve a resolution asking the university
to back down. But he later agreed to give the university until the
task force's Dec. 5 meeting to revise its policy.
   A newly released report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
shows Kentucky with the nation's highest smoking-related death rate.
   Kentucky reported 176 smoking-related deaths for every 100,000
residents in 1985, the agency reported Thursday. Nationwide, smoking
killed 314,574 Americans that year.
   Agriculture Commissioner Ward ``Butch'' Burnette, a smoker and
promoter of the tobacco industry, said the state university's
proposed smoking policy was a slap at the farmers and companies that
pay taxes on their tobacco business.
   ``I personally believe that since we are such a large tobacco
state, it is a mistake for a school like U of L to do that because
so many of their tax dollars come from it,'' Burnette said.
   Dan Hall, special assistant to Louisville's president, said the
school expected some backlash when it began considering the policy,
but is trying to balance health concerns and individual rights.
   ``Given the history and the fact that tobacco has played an
important role in the history of the commonwealth, we expected there
would be some reaction to it,'' Hall said.
   ``This is not an anti-smoking policy. This is not an anti-tobacco
policy.'' Hall said.

<HEAD>Signup for Wheat, Feed Grain, Cotton Programs Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers who want to participate in the
government's 1989 programs for wheat, feed grain and upland cotton
can sign up Dec. 19 through April 14 at county offices, Agriculture
Secretary Richard E. Lyng announced Monday.
   The signup dates for 1989 rice and extra-long staple cotton
programs will be announced later, he said.
   Farmers also will be able to ``declare their intentions'' from
Dec. 19 through Feb. 3 to plant 10 percent to 25 percent of each
program crop's permitted acreage to soybeans or sunflowers and still
protect the acreage base history for the program crops, Lyng said.
   In addition, the 1989 program allows a portion of a farm's
acreage base to be used for oats, with certain stipulations
affecting soybeans.
   During the signup, wheat and feed grains producers may request 40
percent and upland cotton and rice producers 30 percent of their
estimated 1989 deficiency payments. These preliminary payments will
be in cash.
   Deficiency payments are direct subsidies made to farmers to help
bridge the gap between lower market prices and ``target'' prices set
for each commodity.
   For wheat and feed grains, farmers will be able to participate in
an optional acreage ``diversion'' or land-idling program called
0-92. Under it, a farmer can devote all or part of his crop's
permitted acreage to soil-conserving uses and get deficiency
payments on up to 92 percent of the land.
   Rice and upland cotton farmers will be able to participate in a
50-92 version.

   Jury selection began Monday in the trial of
two people charged with bilking 31,000 lonely men out of more than
$4 million by promising them a paradise called Chonda-Za filled with
naked women.
   Donald S. Lowry, 59, of Bettendorf, Iowa, and Pamala St. Charles,
24, of Moline, Ill., who operated the Church of Love, are charged
with multiple counts of mail fraud, one count of conspiracy and
unlawful use of fraud proceeds.
   Prosecutors contend letters were sent to prospective male members
telling them of the Church of Love, which they said was founded in
1965 by a teen-age Mexican girl named Maria Simona Mireles.
   The girl, known as ``Mother Maria,'' supposedly lived with young
women known as the ``Angels of Love'' in an old farm building in
northwestern Illinois. The letters said Mother Maria and the Church
of Love wanted to establish a valley paradise to be known as
Chonda-Za, where men could join the Angels, have all their wishes
fulfilled and spend the rest of their lives.
   Men who sent donations received personalized love letters, racy
audio casettes and photos of naked women identified as members of
the secret sect, prosecutors said.
   Prosecutors contend the paradise never existed and that money
they solicited was funneled to the personal use of the church's
founders and their employees.
   Defense attorneys say the organization was nothing more than a
lonely hearts club that provided fantasies for shy men.
   Indictments issued in December charged that Lowry and Ms. St.
Charles, under the guise of their COL Corp., mailed letters to the
men, asking them to send between $20 and $30 for a membership fee.
   The trial before U.S. District Judge Michael M. Mihm is expected
to last several weeks.

   The chief justice on Monday refused to
grant a hearing to a lawyer who says his constitutional rights were
violated when the government seized his passport.
   The lawyer, Gibson Kamau Kuria, had his passport seized when he
was arrested last year after filing a case on behalf of three people
who said they were tortured by police while being detained without
charges.
   Kuria, who also was detained without charges for eight months,
was released in December 1987.
   Kuria's lawyer, Murungi Kiraitu, petitioned for a hearing to
determine whether the government denied Kuria his legal right to
travel by withholding his passport.
   Justice Cecil Miller said Monday that Kuria's application for a
constitutional court was ``misconceived.''
   ``The constitutional court can only be constituted where there is
a contitutional point in the case,'' Keiwua had argued. ``In this
case there is no such constitutional point raised by the applicant.''
   Kiraitu, who is Kuria's law partner, said he would appeal
Miller's ruling.
   On Wednesday, Georgetown University gave Kuria the Robert F.
Kennedy Human Rights Award for his work in defense of political
prisoners. The award said he was ``one of the few lawyers in Kenya
who defends political prisoners.''

   U.N.-mediated talks to end Western Sahara's
guerrilla war will take place Dec. 1-2 between representatives from
Morocco, which controls most of the territory, and the Polisario
independence movement, a U.N. spokeswoman said Monday.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar will mediate the talks,
said the spokeswoman, Nadia Younes. She did not know who the
representatives from Morocco or Polisario would be.
   The Marxist-led Polisario has been battling Morocco since 1975,
when the Spanish colonial administration pulled out of Western
Sahara and Morocco invaded the northwest African desert territory.
   In August, Polisario and Moroccan officials gave tentative
approval for the United Nations to monitor a referendum leading to
independence or affiliation with Morocco. No date has been set and
other details are in dispute.
   Polisario representatives in New York have said they have about
7,000 fighters, and they want all but 7,000 of the 185,000 Moroccan
troops in Western Sahara withdrawn before the referendum.
   Polisario also wants an end to Moroccan administration and law in
Western Sahara before the referendum.
   The United Nations plans to send 2,000 peacekeeping troops to the
110,000-square-mile territory to monitor the referendum.
   At the last census in 1974, the population was set at about
76,000. Only Saharans counted in that census will be eligible to
vote in the referendum.

   Searching on the ground and from the air
has turned up no trace of a 9-year-old girl or her acne-scarred
kidnapper, but the youngster's mother said Monday she was sure her
daughter was safe.
   ``We need for people to keep an eye out,'' said Sharon Garecht.
``The police have got a lot of leads. We're really hopeful. I
honesty believe that she's okay. Nobody can hide forever.''
   Nine-year-old Michaela went to the market Saturday with a
girlfriend, and when they left the store her scooter was gone. A man
with an acne-scarred face told the fourth-grader her he knew where
it was, then grabbed her and drove away with her while she screamed
for help.
   Scores of volunteers have distributed thousands of fliers since
then in the effort to find the missing girl.
   ``I'm kind of living on nerves. I'm keeping busy,'' said Mrs.
Garecht, who has three other children. She said it is easier to cope
``if you focus on the process of the search and getting her back,
instead of focusing on her being missing.
   ``As my mother said, you really don't have any choice.''
   Police and FBI investigators have searched the hills and parks of
southern Alameda County with helicopters and airplanes. They also
released a composite sketch of the suspect based on the description
given by Michaela's companion.
   Police refused Monday to disclose any leads they may have, but
Lt. Paul Wallace said the only firm lead investigators have to go on
is fingerprints taken from the recovered scooter.
   Rod Garecht spent the day working on a new flier with an updated
photo of his eldest daughter, described as polite and friendly.
   Mrs. Garecht refuses to leave home because she's afraid Michaela
will call while she's gone.
   Michaela and Trina Rodriguez, 8, had ridden scooters to the
market to buy soda and candy. When they emerged, Michaela's red
scooter, which she had borrowed from Trina's brother, was missing.
   Trina told police that while Michaela was looking for her
scooter, a man with dirty-blond, shoulder-length hair beckoned to
her and told her it was by his car.
   When she went to retrieve the scooter, Trina said, the man
grabbed Michaela by the waist, forced her into his car and drove
away on a heavily traveled boulevard.
   The Garechts received support from the parents of 8-year-old
Amber Swartz-Garcia, who disappeared from Pinole on June 3, and the
parents of 10-year-old Kevin Collins, who vanished nearly five years
ago in San Francisco.
   Dave Collins, president of the Kevin Collins Foundation _ an
organization he founded to help others after his own son was
kidnapped _ said a couple of things make Michaela's case unique.
   ``On the positive side is having the composite, something police
can get their hands on,'' said Collins, who spent Monday helping to
coordinate fliers at a San Lorenzo print shop.
   Collins said finding fingerprints at the abduction site is also
unusual and that most abductors are ``far more subtle.''

   The Farmers Home Administration should allow
more time for delinquent borrowers to file replies to the agency's
demand that they come up with a plan to settle overdue accounts,
Rep. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., said Monday.
   Dorgan said 14 members of Congress sent a letter last week to
Vance Clark, head of the FmHA, asking that the 45-day time period be
extended. Notices were sent out last week to 83,500 FmHA borrowers
who are behind in loan repayments.
   Under the rules, the borrowers will have 45 days to reply to FmHA
with information on how they intend to repay, refinance or
restructure overdue loans totaling more than $8 billion.
   Dorgan said the notices, scheduled for mailing Nov. 14-25, put
the 45-day deadline just after the first of next year. Borrowers who
fail to respond in time, or whose proposals are rejected, face
foreclosure by FmHA, he said.
   ``These notices include over 200 pages of complex regulations,''
Dorgan said. ``I feel the farmers should be given sufficient time to
analyze the regulations and compile the necessary information to
fill out the forms corrently.''
   FmHA spokesman Marlyn Aycock said he did not know of any plan by
the agency to extend the 45-day period. ``Not at this point,'' he
said.

   A gunman opened fire through a car window
and killed two men Monday, and police said they suspected it was a
Mafia killing.
   Giovanni Amato and Michele Virga were driving near Piazza Scaffa
when another auto cut them off and forced them to stop.
   At least one gunman ran to the right-hand window and opened fire
with a .38-caliber pistol, killing the men, police said.
   The assassin's car was found abandoned and burned a few hundred
yards away.
   Police said they suspected the Mafia was involved, noting that
Amato, 67, was under investigation for alleged underworld ties. He
was arrested in March in connection with a fraud investigation, but
was freed pending his trial.
   Virga, 52, had no criminal record, police said.

   Two weeks after he lost to Republican
Gov. Edward D. DiPrete, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bruce G.
Sundlun conceded defeat Monday, but said he was leaving the door
``wide open'' for a third run in 1990.
   ``The outcome of this election was disappointing, but the
campaign we waged makes me take heart,'' Sundlun said at a news
conference.
   Sundlun refused to concede on election night, after returns
showed him the loser by a margin of almost 2 percent _ 202,962 votes
for DiPrete and 196,188 for Sundlun. Sundlun's campaign requested a
recount and counting of about 16,000 mail-in ballots, a process that
concluded Thursday with Sundlun still trailing by about 6,800 votes.
   In his first attempt to wrest the governorship from DiPrete, in
1986, Sundlun lost by a 2-1 margin. But this year he made the race
close by repeatedly questioning DiPrete's ethics.
   Sundlun, multimillionaire chairman of Outlet Communications Inc.,
said he would maintain a small staff of researchers and program
developers with an eye toward running for governor again in two
years.

<TEXT>
   A transport strike stranded thousands
of people and forced schools in Manila and Cebu to close Monday,
when President Corazon Aquino marked her first 1,000 days in office
by promising economic revival.
   The military Capital Command said service on about 80 percent of
the 445 passenger jeep routes in Manila was disrupted by a strike
called by drivers demanding lower prices for spare parts.
   It also affected about half the jeep routes in Cebu, the
country's second-largest metropolitan area 350 miles southeast of
Manila. Officials said drivers in Cebu walked out when they heard of
the Manila strike.
   Mrs. Aquino said she had been trying to get prices reduced and
would meet with strikers and spare parts dealers Tuesday in search
of a compromise.
   No serious violence was reported in Manila but police arrested 15
drivers. Among them was Medardo Roda, leader of the militant jeep
driver's association PISTON, which led the walkout.
   The union demanded price reductions after a presidential decree
last week that dropped the minimum fare to about 3 cents for a
2{-mile ride. The old rate was about 4 cents, but the drivers
actually charge about 5 cents.
   Twenty-six military trucks and buses picked up stranded commuters
during Manila's evening rush hour Monday. The government-owned Light
Rail Transit system, not affected by the strike, reported a 66
percent increase in riders and extended its operating hours.
   Police said the 15 strikers were arrested in various parts of
metropolitan Manila for allegedly forcing some drivers to join the
protest.
   Roda was arrested outside the main post office after leaving a
news conference. Police said he may face charges of inciting to
sedition for saying in a broadcast interview he would ``fight the
government to the last.''
   A statement by the May First Movement, a labor confederation to
which PISTON belongs, accused the government of ``repressive
measures in responding to the legitimate struggles and legitimate
demands of our people.''
   Mrs. Aquino told reporters she had asked spare parts dealers to
cut prices and was ``really disappointed'' that drivers went ahead
with the strike.
   Monday was her 1,000th day in the presidency she assumed Feb. 25,
1986, as the result of a civilian-military uprising that forced
President Ferdinand E. Marcos to flee to Hawaii.
   In a televised speech Monday, Mrs. Aquino said her administration
had restored democratic institutions and she would make economic
progress the priority of her final years in office. She set a goal
of 6.5 percent annual growth through the end of her term in 1992 and
pledged to create a million new jobs each year.
   She said blamed right-wing opponents for the slow pace of social
reform, which critics cite as a shortcoming of her government.
Military dissidents have attempted six coups, the most recently in
August 1987.
   ``The military rebels succeeded in all but destroying the faith
and confidence of the world in our country,'' she said.
   Also on Monday, military spokesmen said the army had released 17
human rights activists, including a Dutch woman social worker, after
15 hours of detention in Piat, 220 miles north of Manila. The
activists had spent five days investigating rights violations in the
area and were freed without charges, said Capt. Eufracio Villegas,
army commander in Cagayan province.
   Mrs. Aquino made little mention of plans for safeguarding human
rights and fighting communist and Moslem insurgencies. She said a
60-day nationwide cease-fire with the communists, which expired in
February 1987, had split rebel leadership and the rebellion was
losing support.
   ``Our policy of reconciliation first, and force when it fails,
has brought down the strength of the insurgency considerably,'' she
said.
   Reaction to the speech was mixed.
   Sen. Aquilino Pimentel, who supports the president, said: ``The
insurgency is still active, poverty is still to be eradicated,
public corruption is still to be curtailed. The debilitating foreign
debt is still to be tackled and foreign domination of many aspects
of Philippine society is still a fact of life. ''
   Wilfrido Villacorta, a university professor and member of a
commission that drafted the new constitution, said he was
disappointed by the slight mention of human rights. ``The leadership
still perceives itself as a mere facilitator of transition rather
than a trail-blazing harbinger of social change.''
   Task Force Detainees, an organization supported by the Roman
Catholic Church, said 660 people were slain for political motives
from March 1986 thorugh June.

   A ``Mickey's Motorboat'' toy is being recalled
because the wind-up boat's propeller could come off and cause a
child to choke, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said
Monday.
   The federal commission said consumers should take the toy away
from young children immediately and return it to the store for a
refund.
   The six-inch-long plastic boat has figures of Goofy, Donald Duck
and Cap'n Mickey Mouse, with a propeller to move the boat in water
and wheels to push it along the floor.
   Child World Inc. of Avon, Mass., is recalling the toy, which is
imported from China, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said.
The federal agency said neither it nor Child World knew of any
injuries associated with the toy.

   Windy, wet weather blew across the Northwest on Monday, and a
departing storm dragged wind and showers across New England.
   A cold front across the Pacific Northwest was accompanied by
gusty wind and numerous showers. Wind gusted to 50 mph early in the
day at Friday Harbor, Wash., and Astoria, Ore.
   Rain spread from western and central Washington state through
western Oregon into northern California, and Astoria, Ore., got 1.11
inches of rain in 24 hours.
   A low pressure system moving away from New England left gusty
northwesterly wind in its wake, plus snow showers scattered across
northern parts of New England, from northeastern New York state into
northern Maine. Showers were scattered across western New York state
with snow scattered over the mountains of Pennsylvania.
   High wind knocked out power to at least 3,500 utility customers
in western Massachusetts, sent a 53 mph gust through Chicopee and
may have caused a truck to overturn on a Massachusetts highway
Monday, authorities said.
   Police said wind in Palmer, Mass., took a 5-foot section of brick
off the top of a Main Street building, damaging a few cars parked
below.
   Parts of western Massachusetts got up to 2{ inches of rain
overnight. The Connecticut River at Montague City rose to 15.88 feet
by Monday from 10.56 feet Saturday, according to the Greenfield
Pollution Control Facility. Flood stage there is 28 feet.
   Tropical Storm Keith had moved into the Gulf of Mexico and was
just short of hurricane strength by late afternoon. Meteorologists
said it probably would head toward the west coast of Florida later
in the week.
   Temperatures dipped in Texas early Monday, with a record low of
22 at Midland and a record low of just 20 at San Angelo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 17
degrees at Minot, N.D., to 86 at Avon Park, Fla. Monday morning's
low was 8 degrees below zero at Alamosa, Colo.
   For Tuesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms from tropical
storm Keith were forecast over northern Florida. Rain and gusty wind
was forecast along the northern half of the Pacific Coast region and
inland through the Pacific Northwest.
   Highs in the 20s were predicted over northwestern Minnesota; in
the 30s from the rest of the northern Plains through the upper
Mississippi Valley and the upper Great Lakes into New England; in
the 60s from the southern Atlantic Coast through the Gulf Coast,
Texas, the central high Plains and the southern Rockies into
southern California; in the 70s from southern Arizona into the Los
Angeles basin, the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas and the northern
Florida Peninsula; in the low 80s across central and southern
Florida; and in the 40s or 50s across much of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Carter, Ford to Bush: Cut Spending, Raise Excise Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Presidents Carter and Ford said in a
report Monday that the federal budget deficit, the No. 1 problem
facing President-elect George Bush, could be reduced by cutting
spending and raising taxes on motor fuel, beer, wine and cigarettes.
   The ex-presidents said they went over the report with Bush,
though they wouldn't give details of their meeting with him at the
Old Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House. They said
he listened to them attentively.
   While Bush says his economics team will move swiftly to tackle
deficits once he takes office Jan. 20, he has promised not to raise
taxes. Asked by reporters about the report's proposal to increase
excise taxes, he replied the ex-presidents ``didn't mention that to
me.''
   Carter and Ford were the co-chairmen of a bipartisan group that
wrote the report, entitled ``American Agenda.'' Some 340 experts,
including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former
Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal, contributed to what Ford
called ``a full platter of recommendations.''
   During the presidential campaign, Bush occasionally derided the
most recent Democratic administration, presided over by Carter. But
Carter said Monday he felt no bitterness toward Bush or other
Republicans.
   ``Now is a time of healing,'' he said, adding that both he and
Ford had offered to help Bush deal with Congress in implementing
programs that would serve the United States.
   The budget deficit, which reached about $155 billion this year,
was given priority in the report. Carter said people at home and
abroad are ``vociferous in demanding'' that Bush ``spell out a
program on how the deficit is going to be reduced.''
   Carter contended there was ``no practical way'' to balance a
budget by 1993 solely with spending cuts. Revenues must also be
raised, he said. He defended the idea of a stiffer tax on
cigarettes, which he said are a leading cause of death in the United
States.
   The report suggests Bush and Congress agree to a $40 billion
annual reduction in the deficit as long as there is no recession.
Bush should work with Congress to develop a bipartisan budget
agreement covering two or four years until the budget is balanced in
the mid-1990s, it says.
   Bush could take a number of steps to balance the budget, the
report says.
   They include freezing defense spending at current levels adjusted
for inflation, holding Social Security cost-of-living increases to 2
percent less than the Consumer Price Index, reducing Medicare fees
for doctors as well as trimming agriculture price supports and
public works and transportation appropriations, while increasing
taxes on gasoline, cigarettes, beer and wine.
   The report's other priorities, in descending order after the
budget deficit, are national security and arms control, the savings
and loan crisis, Third World debt and international trade, the fate
of children at risk and U.S. relations with allies.
   The ex-presidents said Bush's second tier of priorities _ issues
of compelling and intrinsic importance but not requiring immediate
action _ should be productivity and education; U.S. relations with
the Soviet Union, Mexico, Nicaragua and Central America; the
environment and drugs.
   On national security, the report suggests that the United States
continue research on Star Wars. The two former presidents said,
however, that they do not believe a total missile defense shield is
possible. They also recommend continuing talks with the Soviet Union
on reducing conventional and strategic weapons.
   Other key issues dealt with in the report are:
   _The savings and loan crisis: Ford and Carter recommend working
out a plan with Congress to raise $50 billion to $100 billion to pay
off depositors in insolvent thrifts, as well as reforming the
insurance fund. Ford called the savings and lone crisis ``one of the
most serious facing the administration.''
   _International trade and Third World debt: The report proposes
upgrading the position of the U.S. trade representative and making
early threats of retaliation against blatantly unfair trade
practices. It also suggests strengthening dispute mechanisms in
multilateral trade pacts.
   _Children at risk: The report advocates more federal aid for
programs that help poor children, such as Head Start, prenatal care
and feeding programs.
   _U.S. relations with the allies: The report says Bush should
reassure allies in Europe and the Pacific that U.S. commitments will
be kept and that stability and progress on arms control policy will
be maintained.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush should make
vigorous use of new powers that Congress has given the president to
get satisfaction from other countries in trade disputes, a
congressional investigative agency said Monday.
   In one of a series of reports on important issues for the
transition to the new presidency, the General Accounting Office said
it has found many instances when a follow-up was needed to get the
benefits of an international trade agreement.
   It added that delaying tactics and slow dispute settlements have
often frustrated efforts to get satisfaction, but the new Trade Act
strengthens the U.S. hand.
   ``Failure to gain timely satisfaction can now trigger a
unilateral U.S. response,'' the GAO report said. ``The new
administration should show strong resolve to vigorously use these
new powers.''
   One provision of the trade law Reagan signed in August permits
him to specify what he considers high-priority unfair trade
practices and to start action toward retaliation while trying to get
a settlement by negotiation.
   Another provision permits him to rule that a country denying
internationally recognized rights to labor can be considered as
engaging in an unfair trade practice, and to retaliate against its
trade.
   The GAO complained of defects in efforts to promote exports. It
said the Commerce Department has chosen questionable trade promotion
events and has been active in countries with little or no potential
for buying more U.S. goods. It did not specify the nations.
   It characterized as ``largely symbolic'' the controls put on
exports to further foreign policy objectives, as distinct from
controls that have security objectives.
   ``When these controls are symbolic, they do not prevent the
targeted country from getting the controlled products from other
countries,'' the report said.
   ``Instead their costs are borne by American businesses in the
form of export sales lost to firms in other countries.''
   The report did not specify either the countries targeted by the
U.S. controls or their suppliers. One nation to which exports are
controlled for foreign policy reasons is South Africa, where
Japanese and West European suppliers have replaced many exports that
can now no longer be shipped by Americans.

<HEAD>12th Parliament Opens with Stormy Session</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's 12th parliament opened Monday with
fiery exchanges between political rivals and a plea from President
Chaim Herzog to save the institution ``from the weakening of its
foundations.''
   Fifteen members initially refused to take the oath of office from
a representative of the extreme right, dramatizing their opposition
to his party's advocacy of expelling Arabs from the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   About 1,000 Israelis, most of them teen-agers, demonstrated
outside against demands by ultra-Orthodox religious parties that
only conversions to Judaism by Orthodox rabbis be recognized.
   In the atmosphere of sharp division, Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir continued seeking a broadly based coalition including the
rival Labor Party of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
   Labor and Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc have been equal partners
in a ``national unity'' coalition government since indecisive 1984
elections.
   Likud won 40 seats in the 120-member Knesset, or parliament, in
the Nov. 1 elections and Labor got 39. Shamir has been negotiating
with small religious and right-wing parties for a parliamentary
majority, as well as offering Labor a junior partnership.
   Labor and Likud leades met Monday night for what could be a
critical negotiating session, Labor officials said.
   Before the meeting, Peres expressed pessimism about prospects for
an agreement with Likud. ``In my estimation we are heading for the
opposition benches,'' the daily Davar quoted Peres as saying in an
interview published Monday.
   Israeli media quoted Shamir as saying ``the chances of forming a
broad government are close to nil,'' but his spokesman Yossi Ahimeir
said the question remained open.
   ``It's a war of nerves,'' Ahimeir said. ``Of course he would like
as broad a government as possible, if it is possible. All options
are open.''
   Labor wants two of three important ministries: defense, finance
and foreign affairs. Likud has agreed to give only one, preferably
defense.
   In the Knesset, leftist legislators from six parties refused to
take the oath from Yair Sprinzak, 77, who as the oldest member was
made chairman of the meeting in keeping with tradition.
   ``In my worst nightmare I never thought someone like you would
swear me in as a member of parliament,'' dissenting legislator Yossi
Sarid shouted in protest.
   Three Arab members _ Tawfiq Zayad, Tawfiq Toubi and Abdel Wahab
Daraushe _ refused the oath by saying they would swear only ``to
fight against oppression and transfer.''
   Transfer is the term Sprinzak's Moledet party uses for expelling
Arabs.
   The 15 protesting legislators later agreed to take the oath so
they could vote for a Knesset speaker.
   Sprinzak, whose late father Yosef was the speaker of Israel's
first parliament, was shouted down when he tried to explain his
party's platform.
   ``Our movement aims to protect our gains from the Six-Day war,''
Sprinzak said, referring to the 1967 Middle East war in which Israel
captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt.
   ``We want to preserve the entire land of Israel and prevent the
relinquishing of any parts of it,'' he added.
   Finance Minister Moshe Nissim was so angered by the spectacle
that he mounted the podium, pounded his fist and declared: ``I've
never seen such a mockery made of our parliament, before the eyes of
our people, the whole world.''
   Dov Shilansky of Likud, a survivor of the Nazi Holocaust, was
elected speaker.
   Herzog, who presided, said at the ceremonial session: ``In Israel
today one senses a gloomy atmosphere, an exaggerated sense of
confusion and distress. We dare not take this (democracy) for
granted. History has known many a democratic government that
collapsed in time of crisis. We, too, are not immune to developments
which may endanger this House.''
   ``The test of your membership in this supreme body of Israeli
democracy will be your readiness and capacity to protect it from the
weakening of its foundations.''

<HEAD>GAO Says Insolvent S&Ls Should Be Shut Down Promptly</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insolvent savings and loans should be shut down
as soon as possible, the General Accounting Office said Monday,
criticizing the current policy of keeping troubled institutions
alive with government rescues.
   ``The time has come to move as quickly as possible to close
insolvent institutions,'' the congressional watchdog agency said in
one of a series of transition reports addressed to the next
administration and Congress.
   ``That means fully recognizing and finding the money to pay for
the losses in those institutions _ money that FSLIC (the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.) does not have today,'' it said.
   In another report, former presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford
called on President-elect George Bush to close all insolvent S&Ls
within two years.
   ``The current approach of merging or selling insolvent
institutions ... defers but does not solve the problem,'' Ford and
Carter said in their report, entitled ``American Agenda.''
   The two former presidents said the industry must continue to pay
for the cleanup of ailing institutions, but they acknowledged, ``the
next president and Congress (also) must go to the taxpayers.''
   GAO analyst Craig Simmons said his agency's call for swiftly
closing insolvent thrift institutions was an implicit criticism of
the current Federal Home Loan Bank Board policy of rescuing failed
thrifts by providing private investors with government cash and
guarantees against future loss.
   Simmons said the GAO was not against all mergers, but said so far
the bank board hasn't had the money to recognize all the losses and
is covering them with open-ended guarantees.
   ``They're not really resolving the problem in the sense of
putting it behind them,'' he said.
   The GAO also said the problem was too large for the industry to
bear alone and said the ``depositing public'' must help, either
through an appropriation of tax dollars or some sort of user charge.
   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the bank board, said ``there are
inherent dangers to local economies'' in closing too many
institutions. Selling too much of the property from failed S&Ls too
fast would drag down the value of property held by healthy
institutions, he said.
   ``There are places in the country where wholesale closings would
result in no services to a community,'' he said. ``... It would be
devastating if we were to do wholesale liquidations in a state like
Texas.''
   The bank board has resolved 146 cases so far this year, but only
26 of them by closing an institution, he said.
   Both the GAO and the former presidents recommended reforms to
prevent a repeat of the S&L mess, estimated to cost $50 billion to
$100 billion to resolve.
   Carter and Ford said the FSLIC should be administratively merged
with the fund for commercial banks under a common regulatory board,
a move opposed by the S&L industry. They called for unspecified
reforms to the deposit insurance system.
   Simmons said the GAO believed a fundamental reform of deposit
insurance was not needed immediately and could delay the resolution
of the crisis, although it did recommend ``reconsidering the wisdom
of the regulatory distinctions between thrift institutions and
commercial banks.''
   The agency suggested experimenting with several reforms. One,
called risk-based deposit insurance, would charge higher premiums to
banks that make risky investments. Another, known as a narrow bank
proposal, would restrict S&Ls to investing deposits in nearly
risk-free areas such as government securities.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental organization said Monday it
would seek a congressional investigation into the Environmental
Protection Agency's softening of an internal report on the status of
pollution monitoring at hazardous waste landfills.
   The internal document found significant non-compliance with
ground water monitoring requirements, but a report released publicly
by the EPA last month painted a ``rosy picture,'' according to the
Environmental Defense Fund.
   An EPA official said the group's complaint was overstated and out
of date.
   The fund released two documents, one the internal report of the
agency's ground water monitoring task force submitted in 1987 and
the other, published in October of this year, entitled ``Hazardous
Waste Ground Water Task Force: 1987 Status Report and 1988-1989
Program Recommendations.''
   The task force was formed in 1984 and disbanded in 1987.
Originally assigned to investigate ground water montoring at 58
sites, it completed field work at 24 before turning over the task to
other EPA offices.
   Kathie Stein, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund,
said the 1988 document ``waters down the findings and conclusions of
the task force and paints an overly rosy picture in an effort to
make the American people believe that the EPA has the situation
under control.''
   After 1984 amendments tightened federal hazardous waste laws,
only about 250 facilities decided to remain in operation.
   The 1987 document said that in the experience of the task force,
``the majority of monitoring well systems ... are not capable of
immediately detecting or assessing a release from a disposal unit.''
That phrase did not appear at the corresponding point in the 1988
document.
   The later document, instead, contained this phrase: ``All 24
facilities had some defects in either the construction or location
of their monitoring wells.''
   J. Winston Porter, EPA's assistant administrator for solid waste
and emergency response, said ``a lot of things that were pointed out
(in the internal report) were true, and what came out of this was a
major uprgade'' of monitoring at hazardous waste facilities.
   But to claim that the internal report was watered down for public
consumption, he said, ``Is a lot of nonsense. People get hold of
interim draft reports and if they find one iota of difference, they
charge whitewash. ... This wasn't a draft, this was partial input.
We didn't use all of it.''

   President-elect George Bush should only appoint
civilians to the top Pentagon jobs if they have a substantial
background in national security issues, the leaders of the Senate
Armed Services Committee said Monday.
   ``Strong defense leadership will be needed during the next four
years,'' said Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and John Warner, R-Va. Nunn
chairs the committee and Warner is the ranking Republican.
   In a letter sent before the election to both Bush and Democratic
candidate Michael Dukakis, the two senators outlined what they said
should be some general qualification standards for top-level
civilian appointments to the Defense Department.
   The letter was released Monday. There was no reply from Bush, who
hasn't yet named any members of his national security team. Former
Sen. John Tower of Texas is considered to be a leading candidate to
become secretary of defense.
   Nunn and Warner said they didn't want to spell out specific
qualifications for each civilian appointment. The Armed Services
Committee will oversee top-level appointments requiring Senate
confirmation.
   The two senators said criteria should include integrity, a
commitment to public service and ability to get along with other
top-level Pentagon officials.
   In addition, there should be ``substantial experience and
expertise,'' they said, because ``there is no time for `on-the-job'
training in the Department of Defense.''
   Nominees also ``should have a substantial understanding of
national security policy and international security affairs,'' the
senators said.

<TEXT>
   At least 7,000 ethnic Albanians
angered by the ouster of two leaders defied threats of a crackdown
and took to the streets in heavy rain Monday, extending a wave of
ethnic protest for a fifth straight day.
   The demonstrators marched about 40 miles to Pristina, capital of
the restive southern province of Kosovo.
   In the northern republic of Slovenia, about 13,000 people braved
a snowstorm Monday to press for more democracy. The two protests
were not related.
   The Slovenians called for a referendum on controversial
constitutional changes and for acquittal of four men sentenced to
jail for making public a classified military document. A rally in
Revolution Square in Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital, drew 10,000
people and another rally in Celje, 42 miles northeast of Ljubljana,
drew 3,000.
   Slovenian courts acted at the last minute Monday to postpone the
scheduled jailing of the three journalists and one army officer,
whose sentencing last summer led to protests and petitions in the
most liberal of Yugoslavia's six republics.
   Kosovo protesters were angered by the resignations Thursday of
Azem Vlasi and Kacusa Jasari, both ethnic Albanian members of the
province's 13-member ruling Politburo.
   The two stepped down under pressure from Serbian Communist Party
leader Slobodan Milosevic, who wants greater control over Kosovo for
its republic, Serbia. He has demanded changes in the 1974
constitution that gave Kosovo broad autonomy.
   Provincial party leaders have promised to review the resignations
of the two ethnic Albanians later this week.
   In a speech Monday in Belgrade, Milosevic reiterated his demand
for the constitutional changes he says are needed to protect
Kosovo's Serb minority from harassment by ethnic Albanians. He made
no reference to the weekend protests in Kosovo by up to 100,000
ethnic Albanians.
   At Monday's protest in a Pristina sports hall, a crowd of about
7,000, mostly workers who trudged 40 miles from the town of
Orohovac, dispersed after a Serbian factory worker defied Milosevic
and backed the ethnic Albanians.
   The worker, Ruzica Imsa, was cheered wildly as she spoke out
against the constitutional reforms pressed by many of her fellow
Serbs.
   ``The working class will not allow itself to be pushed around,''
she said. ``We will not let anyone impose constitutional changes the
people do not want.''
   Local Communist Party leaders were jeered and whistled when they
tried to get the crowd to return home. They then persuaded Imsa to
return to the microphone, and her calm appeal succeeded in
dispersing the crowd.
   Later, another crowd of about 2,000 people arrived from the town
of Klina, some 40 miles north of Pristina.
   Officials had warned of a crackdown if protesters took to the
streets. At an earlier gathering at Pristina University, acting
provincial party head Remzi Koljgeci told students ``unspecified
measures'' would go into force if more protests occurred.
   Under a package of constitutional amendments due to be passed by
each republic by next week, Milosevic wants to restore Serbian
control over Kosovo's judiciary, education and policing.
   The amendments are designed to simplify the complex federal
constitution and give the legal framework to introduce
market-oriented economic reform.
   Most of Milosevic's address dwelt on the need for economic change
and strongly attacked bureaucrats for opposing it.
   Communist leaders in Yugoslavia's other five republics see
Milosevic's campaign as a drive to increase the influence of Serbia,
the largest republic, on the Yugoslav federation.
   But Milosevic claims the changes would only put Serbia on an
equal footing with other republics, which have no administrative
provinces like Serbia's Kosovo and Vojvodina.
   In Slovenia, the proposed reforms have run into opposition from
intellectuals who fear greater central control of the republic's
relatively liberal judiciary.
   The rally in Ljubljana pressed demands for a referendum on the
reforms, which intellectuals believe would be strongly opposed in
Slovenia.

   Pakistan ignored a distress signal and
shot down an Afghan military transport plane that was having
mechanical problems, killing all 27 people on board, Afghanistan's
state radio said Monday.
   Pakistan said it shot down the aircraft after the it crossed the
border and failed to identify itself.
   Kabul radio said the Soviet-made Antanov-26 was flying from Kabul
to Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan when it had technical problems
Saturday night. They radio did not describe the problems, but said
the pilot put out a call for assistance that Pakistani authorities
ignored.
   ``Instead of helping, Pakistan shelled surface-to-air rockets at
the plane against all international laws and norms,'' it said.
   But a Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman said the plane was shot
down by a Pakistani paramilitary force several miles inside
Pakistan, near Parachinar town.
   ``The plane was asked to identify itself and it didn't,'' the
spokesman said. Pakistan has repeatedly complained of air violations
by neighboring Afghanistan.
   The two countries signed a U.N.-mediated agreement in April
providing for the withdrawal of more than 100,000 Soviet troops in
Afghanistan.
   The Kremlin pulled out half of its troops Aug. 15. The remainder
are to leave by Feb. 15, 1989.
   The Soviet Union has been supporting the Marxist Kabul government
in its nine-year fight against U.S.-backed Moslem insurgents.

<HEAD>Oil Workers End Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of oil workers
returned to work Monday, ending a 10-day strike that caused
widespread shortages of cooking gas and heating oil.
   Unions meeting Sunday and Monday voted to accept a government
offer of wage increases, said Lucio Pimentel, spokesman for the
Petrobras state oil monopoly.
   The strike by more than 50,000 petroleum workers paralyzed the
nation's 11 refineries. In emergency bargaining during the weekend,
the government offered strikers a 15 percent cost-of-living raise
and a 4 percent raise tied to productivity.
   Oil workers earn about $300 a month, good pay by Brazilian
standards.
   Petrobras also agreed not to punish strikers and to deduct only
four days' pay from their checks.
   Strike leaders urged unions to accept the offer, although it fell
short of the 26.6 percent raise they demanded.
   The government had suspended the cost-of-living raise last year
when it decreed a 90-day price freeze. Officials said granting the
raise would create more inflation, now at an annual rate of more
than 1,000 percent.
   ``It was a great political victory, although economically it
didn't attain what we wanted,'' Mauro Costa of the national strike
command said in Brasilia.
   During the strike, the government was forced to import emergency
shipments of diesel fuel, cooking gas and kerosene when stocks
threatened to run out completely. Gas rationing was imposed in some
parts of the country.
   Brazil has suffered a recent wave of strikes caused by a
sputtering economy under President Jose Sarney. The strikers have
included national park employees, doctors and nurses at
government-run clinics, electricity workers, subway personnel,
steelworkers and federal employees in at least 17 of 26 ministries.

   President-elect George Bush's campaign
manager, setting ``black outreach'' as a top goal for the Republican
Party's future, said Monday the GOP has formed a political base that
could hold the White House for decades.
   Lee Atwater, tapped to be the new Republican National Committee
chairman, told the nation's GOP governors that in the last three
presidential races the party has laid claim to enough key states
that it ``could and should win the presidency right on through the
next century.''
   Atwater spoke to the annual National Republican Governors
Conference along with Bush's chief of staff-designate, New Hampshire
Gov. John Sununu. The agenda also included two newly named Bush
Cabinet figures, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos.
   The president-elect speaks Tuesday to the conference, which is
being held at the Grand Hotel resort on Mobile Bay.
   Sununu said that with the initial Cabinet announcements, the Bush
administration has begun forming its economic team. He said the next
announcements probably will be after Thanksgiving, with ``the focus
shifting to the defense side.''
   Atwater, reviewing the 1988 campaign and looking to GOP hopes for
the future, said the party has ``an opportunity in the black
community,'' which has been solidly Democratic. In the conference
hall Monday, there were only a couple of blacks in the crowd of
perhaps 400.
   ``Black outreach is a top priority,'' Atwater said, along with
``Hispanic outreach.''
   As for his own role, which has been viewed by Democratic critics
as lowering the level of the presidential campaign, Atwater said:
``I'm not going to try to be a national celebrity. I'm not going to
try to be a statesman. That ain't me.''
   Atwater drew laughter from the Republican crowd when he referred
to Bush's Democratic foe, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. ``I'm
not going to say anything bad about them at this point. I can't
think of anything bad about them that I didn't say in the
campaign,'' he said.
   Atwater's predecessor on the national GOP committee, Frank
Fahrenkopf, said the Democrats' problem in 1988 was ``the wrong
message with the wrong messenger.''
   ``A tremendous political realignment has already taken place,''
he said. ``We have parity on the battlefield now.''
   New York Rep. Jack Kemp, while contending that new taxes are not
needed to deal with budget deficits, also defended the Bush strategy
in the campaign.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, he said, described it as a ``dirty
campaign ... . Mario Cuomo's definition of dirty is when our party
struck back at one of the lowest campaigns that has ever been run
against a man in my political memory.''
   Kemp, discussing the ```Republican revolution,'' said the party's
advances have set the stage for what may be ``the most exciting 10
years'' of this century.
   Thornburgh, saying his office will have a ``full agenda'' in the
Bush administration, devoted most of his comments to the battle
against drugs. He said Bush viewed the drug trade as ``public enemey
No. 1'' and that the statehouses are in the ``front line'' of the
fight.
   Thornburgh also said there must be major change on the demand
side of the drug problem to begin resolving it. He said programs in
the nation's schools should ``make sense'' to young people about
living a drug-free life.
   Cavazos, in a session on education, stressed the importance of
addressing the dropout problem in America's schools. University of
Tennessee President Lamar Alexander, a former governor who joined
Cavazos in the forum, said programs should be kept simple and
``don't always rely on Washington.''
   Taking part in the conference sessions Monday were 20 of the
nation's 23 Republican governors, along with two governors-elect.
Republicans will occupy 22 statehouses next year when new governors
are seated, for a net loss of one state.

   President Reagan on Monday helped
break ground for the library that will house his White House papers,
saying he hoped historians and scholars would ``judge our efforts
well.''
   ``This is a most humbling moment for me,'' said Reagan, who will
relinquish the presidency to George Bush in 60 days. ``The story
that will be told inside the walls that are yet to be built here is
the story not only of a presidency, but of a movement.''
   The president and his wife Nancy flew from Washington to Southern
California to take part in the ceremonies for the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library. The 153,000-square-foot, Spanish-style
facility will be built on a 100-acre site about 45 miles northwest
of Los Angeles.
   The Reagans gave final approval to the site last summer, after
the president viewed the sweeping, hilly area from a helicopter
following a ground inspection by the first lady.
   The selection of the Simi Valley site, about 70 miles southeast
of the Reagans' ranch in Santa Barbara County, came after planners
of the Reagan library were thwarted in an attempt to build it at
Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif.
   Appearing at the ceremony at the outset of a six-day Thanksgiving
vacation at his ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains, Reagan talked
reflectively of his eight years as president.
   ``The journey has not been just my own,'' he said. ``It seems I
have been guided by a force much larger than myself, a force made up
of ideas and beliefs about what this country is and what it could
be.''
   Reagan takes credit for a resurgence of conservatism in America,
and much of the 1988 campaign rhetoric during the Republican primary
season was about what man could best carry on the ``Reagan
revolution.''
   This sea-change was based on a fiscal policy at home aimed at
stimulating economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation of
business, and a resurgence of U.S. international influence brought
about principally by a major military buildup, projections of
American power in the Third World and warming, if unsteady,
relations with the Soviet Union.
   ``What this library will house is the record of ideas and
policies that have undergirded our accomplishments,'' Reagan said.
``There will be much to study here, much to discuss, much to mull
over.''
   ``This library will allow scholars of the future to cast their
own judgments on these years, and I would not presume to predict the
result of their researches,'' he said. ``But I have to believe that
scholars of good will, upon examining the historical record that
will be contained herein, will judge our efforts well.''
   ``But as for us, at present we can only say this: We have done
our best and we pray that it has been enough.''
   The land for the library was donated by a Los Angeles development
company, Blakeley-Schwartz. The selection sparked opposition by
environmentalists initially because the site impinged on a greenbelt
area protected from large-scale development by a decade-old,
non-binding agreement among Simi Valley, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks.
   The $45 million library will be constructed with donations to the
private Ronald Reagan library foundation. It will sit in an area of
rolling hills covered with brush, beavertail cactus and wildflowers.
   Former Attorney General William French Smith told the audience
that over 100,000 people have contributed toward the library's cost,
but he did not say how much of the money has been raised.
   Arrayed on the platform next to the Reagans were several members
of the board of trustees of the presidential library foundation,
including former Attorney General Edwin Meese, former National
Security Adviser and Interior Secretary William Clark, former
domestic policy adviser Martin Anderson, and Energy Secretary John
Herrington.
   After his brief speech, Reagan walked about 30 feet up a knoll,
and he and his wife, each wielding stainless steel shovels that
glistened in the bright sun, turned the first shovelsful of dirt as
more than 250 people applauded.
   The building will include underground storage, a museum and
research materials depicting the administration and historical
events during the Reagan years.
   As the curtain draws on the Reagan presidency, the first couple
seems prepared for the transition back to private life. they will
move into a luxurious home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles in
January _ an estate that they will lease from friends who acquired
the property in their behalf.
   Reagan has said he plans to lecture often ``on the mashed potato
circuit'' and Mrs. Reagan has said she will remain active in the
campaign against drug abuse.
   While in California this week, aides said, the president will act
on various pieces of legislation passed by Congress in its waning
days last month.
   Following their usual pattern, the Reagans also will go horseback
riding, and the president will attend to ranch chores. After their
return to Washington on Sunday, they will have a busy schedule of
parties and other social commitments in their final weeks in the
capital.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Buses halted, some stores were
closed and school attendance dropped Monday because of a general
strike to protest policies of the military government.
   Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril's government said it ``noted with
satisfaction'' business activity picked up Monday afternoon ``in
spite of the multiple appeals which aimed at the paralysis of
national life by an illegal strike.''
   About one-third of the stores in downtown Port-au-Prince were
closed and most others opened late. Fewer street vendors than usual
were working, traffic was down and schools were poorly attended.
Police were stationed on street corners and soldiers guarded gas
stations, but no violence was reported.
   Radio reports said activity also slowed in many other cities and
towns.
   Haiti's largest labor federation, the Automomous Union of Haitian
Workers, said the strike was a warning to the government against any
attempt to re-establish a dictatorship.
   The two other major labor federations did not take part and only
one major political parties openly supported the strike.
   Avril assumed the presidency in a coup on Sept. 17 in which
noncommissioned officers ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, sending him
into exile in the neighboring Dominican Republic.
   Avril pledged to restore Haiti's constitution and hold
presidential elections.

   A strike by editorial workers at the Chicago
Sun-Times was postponed Monday when the newspaper's management made
a new contract proposal, a Sun-Times official said.
   Brian Fantl, director of labor relations for the newspaper, said
a pay raise could be part of the offer, but that an agreement with
the federal mediator prevented him from revealing details of the
proposal.
   The proposal was taken to the union's executive committee, and
Fantl said he expected a response later Monday.
   Union representatives were at a meeting at the Sun-Times and were
unavailable for comment.
   As the strike deadline of 2:30 p.m. came and went, both sides
said they were prepared for a walkout, which would be the first
strike by editorial workers in the newspaper's 40-year history.
   ``The picket-line chants are all set and ready to go,'' union
spokesman Dan Lehmann, the newspaper's religion writer, said earlier
in the day. Picket signs and leaflets were printed and waiting, he
said.
   Sun-Times spokesman Michael Soll said management did not want a
strike, but was ``fully prepared to produce a paper'' using company
executives, non-union editors and outside writers.
   At the rival Chicago Tribune, a 40-month-long printers strike
could end this week following the strikers' overwhelming approval of
a new three-year contract. But walkouts by mailers and pressmen at
the newspaper continued.
   The strike deadline at the Sun-Times was set by Chicago Newspaper
Guild Local 71, which represents 250 reporters, editors,
photographers and support staff. The union has been working without
a contract since June 1.
   Soll said company negotiators were willing to meet around the
clock, and he hoped an agreement could be reached at the meeting,
which began at 9 a.m. Monday.
   A federal mediator, William Sigler, was working with negotiators,
officials said.
   ``There seems to be much less anguish and much more hope'' than
in previous days, Soll said after talks resumed.
   The guild has been seeking a 19.5 percent pay raise over three
years. Prior to Monday, management had proposed a 3 percent salary
cut for 18 months, followed by a restoration of current pay levels
for the remainder of the three-year pact, guild unit chairman Thomas
Gibbons said.
   Starting reporters earn $625 weekly, going up to $895 for
reporters with five years' experience.
   In addition, Gibbons said, differences remained over management
proposals to cut night differential for workers by 40 percent and
exempt eight senior editorial staffers from union jurisdiction.
   Soll said ``the paper is healthy financially'' but must control
costs to remain competitive with the larger Chicago Tribune, which
has an estimated circulation of 765,000 daily and 1.117 million
Sunday.
   The Sun-Times, whose circulation is estimated at 605,000 daily
and 614,000 on Sunday, was purchased from media baron Rupert Murdoch
for $145 million in June 1986 by a group of investors led by the New
York investment firm Adler & Shaykin.
   At the Tribune, members of Local 16 of the Chicago Typographical
Union voted 180-43 Sunday to approve the new pact and an $8.56
million settlement fund. Tribune President Charles Brumback has
until Thursday to decide whether to sign the agreement.
   Under its terms, the 119 printers still on strike, down from 240
who walked out originally, would have the option of a buyout or a
lifetime annuity, as well as receiving company-paid medical
coverage. About 50 printers who went back to work under a 1986
unconditional offer to return can stay on at the paper under terms
of the three-year contract, which includes pay increases, or they
can accept a $30,000 cash buyout.

   A car bomb exploded Monday near a
motorcade in which four senior leaders of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah
group were riding in east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, but the
assassination attempt failed, police said.
   Two bodyguards and a pedestrian were slightly wounded, they said.
   No group claimed responsibility.
   Police also said two militiamen were killed and five wounded at
nightfall in a shootout involving rival Sunni Moslem factions in
south Lebanon's southern port of Sidon, but gave no details.
   Police and Hezbollah _ or Party of God _ said a remote-controlled
van packed with 330 pounds of TNT blew up about 450 feet from the
10-car motorcade carrying Sheik Subhi Tufaili, Abbas Mousawi, Hassan
Nasralla and the party's chief spokesman, Sheik Ibrahim Amin.
   The convoy was rolling through Sifri village on the road linking
the northeastern towns of Baalbek and Riyak in the Syrian-policed
valley when the roadside car bomb went off.
   A Hezbollah statement said the three leaders and their companions
were returning to Baalbek, the party's stronghold in the valley,
from a rally in Riyak.
   But police said the convoy only made a brief stop in Riyak. They
said the four leaders were returning via Damascus, the Syrian
capital, from a visit to Iran.
   The Hezbollah statement did not speculate on who set the bomb.
   But it said: ``This is a criminal attempt on the lives of the
three leaders. We possess enough clues that will enable us soon to
uncover the culprits and their masterminds.''
   The Hezbollah has been locked in a struggle with the
Syrian-backed Shiite Amal militia for dominance of the 1 million
Shiites who make up Lebanon's largest single sect.
   Amal's chieftain Nabih Berri last month accused Hezbollah of
engineering the assassination of Amal's top three leaders in south
Lebanon.

<TEXT>
   Christina Onassis was happy and enthusiastic
in the days before she died suddenly. She planned to buy an
apartment and may even have found romance, friends, relatives and
news reports said Monday.
   Ms. Onassis, 37, who died Saturday of what an autopsy report
described as acute pulmonary edema, was a frequent visitor to the
Argentine capital. She was in the city for four days in late October
and returned again on Nov. 9.
   Her visits were motivated by her close friendship with Marina and
Alberto Dodero, members of a wealthy Argentine family that had long
been associated with Ms. Onassis' late father, shipping tycoon
Aristotle Onassis.
   That friendship may have extended to a romantic interest in Mrs.
Dodero's brother, Jorge Tchomlekdjoglou, 43, Buenos Aires newspapers
suggested Monday.
   Ms. Onassis had rented a suite at the luxurious Alvear Palace
Hotel, in the heart of La Recoleta, one of city's most exclusive
areas, filled with expensive restaurants, night spots and boutiques.
   Nevertheless, the heiress wanted to spend ``all the time she
could'' at the Tortuguitas Country Club, where the Doderos have a
weekend home, said Mercedes Zavalia, public relations director for
the hotel.
   ``She had even bought some running shoes to be able to run
there,'' Miss Zavalia told the Buenos Aires newspaper La Razon.
   Miss Zavalia said she often chatted with Ms. Onassis, ``who
insisted on being treated like just another guest.'' She described
the heiress as ``a person who made decisions on the spur of the
moment.''
   ``The other day, for example, she decided to leave the country,
but she must have changed her mind at least five times in the course
of the day,'' Miss Zavalia said.
   Tortuguitas Country Club, 25 miles northwest of the city, is
comprised of about 350 weekend homes owned by wealthy Argentines
   Annabella Onassis, a cousin, recalled that Ms. Onassis attended a
party at the club the night before her death and ``appeared to be
feeling very well.''
   The cousin told reporters that on the day of her death Ms.
Onassis and Mrs. Dodero planned to go swimming in a pool and went to
change shortly before 11 a.m.
   Ms. Onassis took overly long in emerging from the bathroom where
she was changing. Her friend went to look for her ``and found her
lying on the bathroom floor,'' the cousin told reporters.
   A conflicting version was published Monday by the Buenos Aires
newspaper Clarin, which cited Dodero family attorney Juan Carlos
MacDonald as saying the heiress died in her sleep at the Dodero home.
   Family members discounted the possibility that Ms. Onassis could
have committed suicide.
   ``A happy person could never commit suicide and Christina was
content and very happy,'' Mary Onassis, an aunt, told reporters.
``She had no (apparent) health problems.''
   Mary Onassis told reporters that her niece planned to attend a
party Saturday night given by members of Buenos Aires' Greek
community.
   ``Christina was in the best part of her life,'' Mary Onassis said.
   Ms. Onassis also had made plans to attend a Sunday night birthday
party for Greek Orthodox Archbishop Ganadius Chrysolakis, who
presided over her funeral Mass on Sunday morning.
   The archbishop told reporters he spoke to Ms. Onassis only last
Wednesday.
   ``We chatted for a long while and shared a meal,'' Chrysolakis
told the official news agency Telam. ``She told me she was very
happy that a series of family problems she was going through had
been resolved. She was enthusiastic. She was very happy.''
   Tamara Revitis, the archbishop's secretary, told Radio Rivadavia
of Buenos Aires that Ms. Onassis had ``appeared very enthusiastic''
and ``had been making plans to buy an apartment in Buenos Aires''
with the apparent intention of moving to the city. She maintained
homes in Paris and St. Moritz, Switzerland.
   The motive for her decision to buy a home, several Buenos Aires
newspapers suggested, was Ms. Onassis apparently had a romantic
interest in Jorge Tchomlekdjoglou.
   The Doderos and Ms. Onassis' relatives were not immediately
available to comment on published reports that a marriage was in the
offing.
   Ms. Onassis was married and divorced four times and had a
3-year-old daughter.

   A judge on Monday dismissed an inheritance
claim by a woman who says her mother had a four-day love affair with
Elvis Presley and that she is his daughter.
   Aspiring singer Deborah Delaine Presley had filed the inheritance
petition in Shelby County Probate Court, which oversees Presley's
will. Judge Joseph Evans ruled there was insufficient evidence to
warrant further review of the claim.
   Miss Presley's request included an affidavit from her mother,
Barbara Jean Young, who said she spent four days with Presley in
1955 at a mobile home near Jackson, Miss.
   ``The only things that stopped us from staying in each others
arms was the need to eat lunch and dinner,'' the affidavit said. It
said Miss Presley was born nine months later.
   Miss Presley's last name was Yandell, until she had it changed.
   When Presley died of heart disease in 1977, his estate was valued
at $5 million to $7 million. Managers of the Presley trust opened
the singer's former Memphis residence to tourists in 1982, and now
the estate is estimated at $50 million. The estate also draws
royalties from Presley's recordings and controls the use of his name
and image.
   A trust monitored by the Probate Court manages the Presley estate
for Lisa Marie Presley, 20, the singer's only legal child, and she
takes it over at age 25.

   The aging state airplane that had to make an
emergency landing with Gov. Mario Cuomo aboard ran into problems
again Monday when pilots decided not to take it up because they
didn't like the way it was handling.
   Department of Environmental Conservation pilots had been planning
to fly the Grumman Gulfstream G1 from an airport near
Mountoursville, Pa., where it made the emergency landing Sunday, to
an aviation company in Wilmington, Del., said department spokesman
R.W. Groneman.
   When the turboprop taxied onto the runway for takeoff, the pilots
decided to return it to the hangar.
   ``They didn't feel comfortable taking it up,'' said Groneman, who
couldn't say what the pilots didn't like about the way the plane was
functioning.
   The plane, the largest in the state's fleet, had been set to fly
to Atlantic Aviation's maintenance center, where the 22-year-old
aircraft underwent a $628,000 overhaul in 1987.
   Earlier Monday, the craft had been inspected by two officials
from the Federal Aviation Administration, said FAA spokeswoman
Kathleen Bergin in Queens. She said she didn't know whether the
federal inspectors had determined why the plane malfunctioned.
   Cuomo, speaking to reporters Monday, tried to play down the
seriousness of Sunday's mishap and said regardless of the plane's
fate, the state cannot afford a replacement. It would cost $12
million to $13 million to buy an airplane of comparable size to the
17-passenger G1.
   ``How could we (buy a new plane), with all of the problems we
have?'' said the governor, whose state is facing a deficit estimated
at nearly $2 billion.
   ``You should ground the governor before you spend $13 million on
a new plane,'' he said.
   When the plane had problems previously, Cuomo said he would use
smaller planes to travel within the state and take commercial
flights on longer trips if it couldn't be repaired.
   Cuomo insisted that the plane remains basically sound, despite
having to make three emergency landings in the past 16 months, twice
with the governor on board.
   ``It's not a dramatic threat to anybody,'' he said. ``If it were,
we wouldn't be on the plane. And if they tell me it's a dramatic
threat, then I won't be on the plane.''

   A panel considering President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's plans for change recommends curtailing the power of a
new national council in response to accusations that the Kremlin
concentrates too much power in Moscow.
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, said Monday the commission of
the Supreme Soviet recommended dropping language that gives the new
Council of People's Deputies the power to reject laws adopted by
legislatures of the 15 Soviet republics.
   The commission is reviewing constitutional amendments to be
considered by the national parliament next week.
   Proposed amendments designed to reorganize the governing
apparatus hve generated considerable opposition, particularly in the
independence-minded Baltic republics but also in letters published
by the Soviet press.
   In one manifestation of recent demands for more authonomy,
thousands of Lithuanians chanting ``For shame!'' jammed the center
of Vilnius, capital of Lithuania, on Monday to protest their
legislature's refusal to declare the republic's autonomy from
Moscow, residents said.
   The Supreme Soviet commission, in a Saturday meeting that was the
subject of Pravda's report Monday, also suggested changing language
that authorizes new council to decide the composition of the Soviet
Union, its constituent republics and autonomus regions.
   A dispatch from Tass, the official news agency, said the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, the
largest republic, denounced the Estonian action as a contradiction
of ``the basic principles of socialist federalism.''
   As proposed by the Kremlin leadership, the amendment empowers the
Council of People's Deputies to ``take decisions relative to the
composition of the U.S.S.R., the approval of the formation of new
autonomous republics and autonomous regions in the composition of
the union republics.''
   According to Pravda, the commission suggested limiting the
council to matters ``on the questions of national-state structure
relative to the jurisdiction of the U.S.S.R.''
   It said changes recommended by the commission were part of an
effort to increase ``the development of the sovereign rights of the
republics.''
   Just how far those ``sovereign rights'' go is a subject of
dispute between Estonia, one of the three Baltic republics, and
central authorities in Moscow.
   Last week, the Estonian legislature adopted a declaration of
sovereignty giving the republic veto power over Soviet laws and
proclaiming once-independent Estonia's power in all matters except
defense and foreign policy
   Although the Supreme Soviet commission sought to limit the power
of the new council, it also condemned the Estonian legislature's
action on grounds that giving laws of a republic authority over
national statutes violates the 1977 Soviet Constitution.
   The Presidium, the Supreme Soviet executive body, has said it
will review Estonia's action and has summoned Estonian leaders to
Moscow to explain.
   Gorbachev's initial personal reaction to developments in the
Baltics was mild. He said during a visits to India such actions were
an exercise of ``perestroika,'' his program to reform the political
and economic system.
   Constitutional amendments proposed by Gorbachev have caused a
furor in Lithuania and Estonia and, and to a lesser degree in
Latvia, because they are seen as limiting the powers of the
republics as the Baltics seek greater control over their own affairs.
   They are part of his political restructuring, which includes
creation of a more powerful presidency and a full-time national
legislature.
   In Vilnius on Monday, the Lithuanian Movement for Perestroika
called a 10-minute protest at noon that a spokeswoman said halted
traffic in the downtown area.

   Two African National Congress
members were convicted of treason Monday in connection with two mine
explosions, and a Swazi co-defendant was found guilty of terrorism.
   Ebrahim Ismail Ebrahim, a senior member of the outlawed ANC and a
founding member of its military wing, was abducted from Swaziland in
December 1986 and held in solitary confinement until May 1987, when
he was charged with treason.
   He and ANC member Simon Dladla were found guilty Monday in
Pretoria Supreme Court in connection with mine explosions last year
in the Transvaal towns of Volksrust and Breyten.
   The trial had been controversial because of Ebrahim's abduction
from Swaziland by men he identified as South African police. The
defense argued in a separate hearing that South African courts had
no jurisdiction to try Ebrahim.
   Adriaan Vlok, the law and order minister, would not comment on
whether Ebrahim had been abducted but said no South African
policemen were involved if he was kidnapped.
   Although the explosions occurred after Ebrahim was in custody,
the state contended that he was responsible because it said he
coordinated and planned ANC military operations from Swaziland.
   Ebrahim left South Africa in 1979 after completing a 15-year
prison term for various acts of sabotage.
   The judge said co-defendant Anton Mandla Maseko could not be
found guilty of treason because as a Swazi citizen he did not owe
allegiance to South Africa. He was convicted of terrorism.
   The three men are to be sentenced later.

   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
announced an investigation Monday into the way Japan runs its
building trades, to see if it includes unfair practices that hurt or
threaten U.S. industry.
   He said the action was required by the Trade Act that President
Reagan signed into law in August.
   The investigation will cover Japanese acts, policies and and
practices that may be barriers to U.S. architectural, engineering
and construction services, and consulting services related to them.
Yeutter's statement said the U.S. government will consult with the
government of Japan and seek advice from business committees and the
public.
   A finding of unfair practices could lead to U.S. retaliation.
   Last year Japan opened construction on the huge Kansai
International Airport to foreign bidders, after a long dispute on
access for U.S. companies. The airport will serve Osaka.
   The announcement of the investigation came as President-elect
George Bush was advised to make vigorous use of the new powers that
Congress has given the president to get satisfaction from other
countries in trade disputes.
   The advice came from the General Accounting Office, which has
prepared a series of brief reports on important issues for the
transition to the new presidency, which begins on Jan. 20.
   A report on trade released Monday said the office had found many
instances when a follow-up was needed to get the benefits of an
international trade agreement. It added that delaying tactics and
slow dispute settlements have often frustrated efforts to get
satisfaction, but the new Trade Act strengthens the U.S. hand.
   ``Failure to gain timely satisfaction can now trigger a
unilateral U.S. response,'' the report said.
   ``The new administration should show strong resolve to vigorously
use these new powers.''
   The report was submitted by Comptroller General Charles A.
Bowsher, the head of the office, to Congress and to ``the U.S. Trade
Representative designate.'' Bush has not yet appointed a successor
to Yeutter, who is expected to leave with Reagan's administration,
which goes out of office Jan. 20.
   The report does not specify which new powers it means. Other
governments have said they were worried that the president now has
additional power to protect U.S. industry against competiion. One
new provision of the new law permits him to specify what he
considers high priority unfair trade practises and to start action
toward retaliation while trying to get a settlement by negotiation.
   Another provision permits him to rule that a country denying
internationally recognized rights to labor can be considered as
engaging in an unfair trade practise, and to retaliate against its
trade.
   The GAO complained of defects in efforts to promote U.S. exports.
It said the Commerce Department has chosen questionable trade
promotion events and has been active in countries with little or no
potential for buying more U.S. goods. It did not specify the
countries.
   It criticized as ``largely symbolic'' the controls put on exports
to further U.S. foreign policy objectives, as distinct from controls
which have security objectives.
   ``When these controls are symbolic, they do not prevent the
targeted country from getting the controlled products from other
countries,'' the report said.
   ``Instead their costs are borne by American businesses in the
form of export sales lost to firms in other countries.''
   The report did not specify either the countries targeted by the
U.S. controls, or their suppliers. One country where U.S. exports
are controlled because of U.S. foreign policy is South Africa, where
Japanese and west European suppliers have replaced many exports that
can now no longer be shppied by Americans.

   Federal officials said Monday unsafe levels of
methanol had been found in two brands of Portuguese brandy.
   The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said people
should not drink Aveleda Bagaceira Marc Brandy or Aveleda Aguardente
Reserva but should return the bottle to the retailer.
   The maximum safe level of methanol in brandy is .35 percent by
volume, the federal bureau said. Laboratory testing of the two
brandies found methanol levels from .412 to .660 percent by volume,
the bureau said in a statement.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said that such levels
of methanol in brandy pose a potential health threat, depending on
how much is consumed.

   President Hosni Mubarak appeared with PLO
leader Yasser Arafat at a joint news conference on Monday and
advised Israel to be careful in its reaction to Egypt's recognition
of the newly proclaimed Palestinian state.
   Mubarak's remark came the day after Egyptian recognition and he
entertained the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman at a
state dinner and a three-hour session of separate and enlarged talks.
   ``Israel should be precise in its statements and should know that
we also want peace,'' Mubarak said.
   ``All the people in the region, including the Israeli people,
want peace.''
   The news conference was carried by the state-owned Middle East
News Agency.
   Mubarak was apparently responding to reported Israeli threats to
delay an Israeli withdrawal from disputed Taba Beach. Israel refused
to return Taba to Egypt when Israel withdrew from Sinai in 1982, but
an international arbitration team ruled two months ago that the area
belonged to Egypt.
   An Israeli government official said in Jerusalem Monday that
Israel's 10-member Inner Cabinet will discuss Egypt's move at a
session Wednesday and will debate such a possibility.
   Mubarak was also referring to Israeli accusations that Egypt
violated the U.S-brokered 1978 Camp David peace accords, which
produced the first peace treaty between Israel and Egypt but failed
to grant any sort of autonomy to the 1.5 million Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Arafat flew into Cairo from Baghdad, Iraq, on Monday and said he
and Mubarak will discuss a common approach to a Mideast peace
conference.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on Monday
summoned Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny and expressed
Israel's regret over Cairo's recognition of the Palestinian state, a
ministry official said.
   The official said Peres told Bassiouny the move violated
Israeli-Egyptian treaties that call for the final status of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip to be negotiated in peace talks. Bassiouny told
Peres that recognition did not violate Egypt's agreements with
Israel, he reported.
   Wearing his usual military fatigues and black checked scarf,
Arafat spoke briefly to reporters at the airport before leaving with
Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid in a Mercedes Benz flying the
Egyptian and Palestinian flags.
   It was the first time in Cairo that the PLO flag flew on an
official car, an honor normally reserved for heads of state and
ambassadors.
   However, there were no red carpets, military bands or other
trappings of a head of state's arrival.
   ``I am really happy to be here, especially after the declaration
(of a Palestinian state) by the Palestine National Council (the
PLO's parliament),'' Arafat said.
   ``I can brief my brothers, headed by President Hosni Mubarak, on
the details of the PNC and draw a common visualization of effective
steps for the promotion of an international Middle East peace
conference.''
   Since the Palestinian state was declared Nov. 15 in Algiers,
Arafat has flown to Morocco, Mauritania, back to Algeria and to Iraq
to drum up support for future peace moves.
   The Palestinian council declaration did not define the boundaries
of its new state, but implied it meant the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
war. The declaration said Jerusalem would be the capital of the
Palestinian state.
   Palestinian sources in Baghdad said Monday that Arafat urged Arab
ambassadors there to press the United States to grant him a visa so
he can address the U.N. General Assembly.
   The Israeli official in Jerusalem said Egypt's Bassiouny told
Peres at their 40-minute meeting that Egypt viewed the PLO's
conditional acceptance of U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 as a
recognition of Israel.
   The resolution, adopted after the 1967 war, calls on Israel to
withdraw from captured territory, but also asserts the right of all
countries in the region to live in secure borders.
   Egypt is the third country which has diplomatic relations with
Israel to recognize the declared Palestinian state. The others are
Turkey and Cyprus.

   An earthquake rocked the Azores
archipelago in the mid-Atlantic on Monday, damaging some buildings
on the largest island, officials said. No injuries were reported.
   The earthquake measured 5.8 on the Richter scale, meaning a quake
capable of causing considerable to severe damage, said Pat Jorgensen
of the U.S. Geologic Survey in Menlo Park, Calif.
   Portuguese government officials said the quake shook the islands
of Sao Miguel, Santa Maria and Terceira at 11:55 a.m. EST.
   Ms. Jorgensen said the quake struck at 3:56 p.m. local time
(11:56 a.m. EST) and was centered about 50 miles north of Sao
Miguel. She said there were reports of minor damage and the temblor
was felt over a wide area.
   Buildings were damaged in northern Sao Miguel, largest of the
Portuguese chain's nine islands, but there were no reports of
injuries, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
   It said many people on the island panicked and roofs, stone walls
and chimneys were damaged.
   Tremors also were felt on Santa Maria and Terceira, where the
United States has an air base. The Azores are near the North
Atlantic Ridge, a seismically active line stretching north and south
in the Atlantic Ocean, where two plates of Earth's crust are pulling
apart.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage, one
measuring 5 can cause considerable damage and a quake of magnitude 6
can cause severe damage.
   A earthquake that hit the Azores Jan. 1, 1980, killed at least 49
people and injured more than 300 on Sao Jorge and Terceira.

   Winter storms stranded thousands of
motorists on icy highways Monday and forced postponement of an
important military ceremony because a French general could not get
there.
   Ice-and-snow storms whipped across many sections of West Germany,
bringing rush-hour traffic to a halt on the high-speed autobahns and
wreaking havoc with air traffic. Traffic snarls as long as 15 miles
were reported on some highways, along with hundreds of minor
accidents.
   In Switzerland, the first big snow of the season closed Alpine
mountain passes, clogged roads and delayed air travel.
   Red Cross workers took hot tea to motorists caught in traffic
jams in southern West Germany. Dozens of vehicles ran out of gas
while waiting to move.
   A collision involving 15 trucks and a passenger car backed up
traffic on an autobahn near Ulm. Police said one person was injured
in the collision.
   Gen. Gilbert Forray, the French army chief of staff, was
scheduled to meet his West German counterpart, Gen. Henning von
Ondarza, in the southern town of Boeblingen for an official ceremony
marking formation of a joint French-German brigade.
   Forray's plane could not land at Stuttgart because of bad weather
and the ceremony was postponed, with a new date not specified,
German officers at Boeblingen said. Officials said 49 flights were
canceled at Stuttgart.
   West Germany and France agreed last year to create a joint army
brigade.
   ZDF television said schools in Saarland schools closed because of
slippery roads.
   More than 4 inches of new snow was reported in parts of southern
West Germany.
   Snow blanketed eastern Switzerland and the western Jura hills.
Zurich reported 6 to 8 inches and St. Gall 10 inches.
   San Bernardino and Fluela passes were closed temporarily and the
St. Gotthard pass was shut for the winter, the Swiss Touring Club
said. Seven other passes were closed earlier this month.
   Snow blocked runways and hampered visibility at Zurich's
international airport, delaying flights up to three hours, an
airport spokesman said. Police reported many highways blocked by
auto accidents.

   U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia and his wife were
indicted Monday on bribery, extortion and conspiracy charges in the
Wedtech corruption scandal, accused among other things of accepting
a diamond-and-emerald necklace from the company's founder.
   Garcia, 55, and his wife, Jane Lee Garcia, 48, were accused of
extorting $76,000 in payments from Wedtech Corp., as well as a
$20,000 interest-free loan from one-time Wedtech vice chairman Mario
Moreno.
   In addition, the Garcias were accused of taking $77,500 and the
necklace from Wedtech founder John Mariotta and his wife, Jennie, in
1985.
   None of the payments, the loan or the jewelry was reported on
Garcia's congressional financial disclosure forms in 1984 and 1985,
according to the seven-count indictment.
   Attorney Ralph Vallone Jr., 41, of Santurce, Puerto Rico, was
accused of funneling $86,100 in Wedtech payments through his law
office to Mrs. Garcia as ``consulting fees,'' passing on $76,000 and
keeping $10,100 for himself.
   Wedtech, now out of business, was a tiny South Bronx machine shop
that grew into a multimilion-dollar-a-year defense contractor
through a Small Business Administration program that allowed
minority-owned firms to obtain government contracts without
competitive bidding.
   Vallone and the Garcias face a maxium penalty of up to 20 years
in prison and $250,000 in fines if convicted of extortion, the most
serious charge. They all face maximum penalties of two to 15 years
in prison on additional charges of conspiracy, bribe receiving and
receipt of an illegal gratuity.
   They are to be arraigned Dec. 1.
   Garcia, Mariotta and Moreno met with the governor of Puerto Rico
in 1985, the indictment said, although the governor was not accused
of any wrongdoing.
   The indictment charged that on Aug. 2, 1985, Garcia met with
Moreno in his Bronx congressional office, and allegedly directed the
Wedtech executive to make the $20,000 loan through Garcia's sister,
the Rev. Aimee Cortese.
   This was done, the indictment said, ``so that it would falsely
appear that Aimee Cortese, not Mario Moreno, was the source of the
loan.''
   Ms. Cortese was pastor of the Cross Road Tabernacle.
   The loan was repaid in two $10,000 payments, the indictment said.
   Neither Garcia nor his attorney, Robert Morvillo, was available
for comment, but Garcia issued a statement through spokesman Bill
Danvers.
   ``I am grateful that this period of trial by grand jury leaks is
finally over,'' the statement said. ``I note that despite an
investigation which has lasted nearly two years and has scrutinized
virtually every facet of my personal and professional life, the
charges deal only with the preposterous allegations of Mario Moreno,
one of the most notorious felons of the 20th century.''
   Moreno was one of four Wedtech officials who pleaded guilty to
bribing government authorities and cooperated with prosecutors in
several earlier Wedtech cases.
   Moreno testified earlier this year at the trial of former U.S.
Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-Bronx, that the company had paid $80,000 to
Garcia.
   The payments, for ``political favors and political
introductions'' allegedly were made to Garcia ``because he and his
wife requested it,'' said Moreno.
   Moreno also testified about numerous alleged payoffs to bankers,
businessmen, union officials and a public utility manager.
   ``The overall Wedtech investigation is still continuing,'' said
U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani.
   Giuliani would not say what Garcia allegedly did in return for
the payments, saying he could not go beyond the language of the
indictment, which did not specify further.
   Through his spokesman, Garcia said he was innocent and vowed to
fight the charges ``with all of my God-given strength.''
   Garcia was re-elected earlier this month, despite continuing
rumors that he would face corruption charges.
   On Friday, Biaggi, another Bronx Democrat, was sentenced to eight
years in prison for his part in the Wedtech scandal.
   Mariotta, Wedtech's founder, once described by President Reagan
as one of the ``heroes for the '80s,'' was among those convicted of
racketeering with Biaggi. At least 19 people have been convicted in
the case to date.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha met Monday
with the leaders of the country's four nominally independent black
homelands and declared the group part of a unified ``economic
community of southern Africa.''
   In a statement later, Botha said he discussed economic matters,
political reform and foreign relations with the leaders of Transkei,
Ciskei, Venda and Bophuthatswana.
   ``We are a community which places emphasis on economic
cooperation and development,'' the statement said.
   The statement did not announce any agreements, but said the group
had decided to refer to itself in the future as the ``economic
community of southern Africa.''
   The homelands, which are not recognized by any foreign countries,
are heavily dependent on South African aid to support their meager
economies.
   In addition to economic difficulties, political turmoil and
frequent reports of widespread corruption have plagued several of
the homelands.
   In Transkei, lengthy hearings have been held into corruption
allegations against George and Kaiser Matanzima, brothers who ruled
the homeland from 1976 until 1987, when George Matanzima, then prime
minister, was ousted in a coup.
   The homeland now is ruled by a 33-year-old army commander, Bantu
Holomisa. He recently said it might be possible for Transkei to
rejoin South Africa if apartheid _ South Africa's racial segregation
system _ were abolished.
   Lennox Sebe, president of Ciskei, has often tilted with
Transkei's rulers. Both neighboring homelands, separated by a strip
of South African territory, are Xhosa tribal areas and Ciskei
accuses Transkei of plotting to take it over. Several of Sebe's
relatives, whom he had imprisoned for plotting against him, escaped
with the help of a band of armed white men believed to be South
Africans, and fled to Transkei in 1987.
   In Bophuthatswana, an attempted coup by dissident soldiers in
February was put down when South African troops rescued President
Lucas Mangope, who had been seized by the rebels.
   In Venda, thousands of students have boycotted classes to protest
alleged cover-up of ritual murders. Police acknowleged that ritual
murders took place and said they were investigating. No official
account of the motives for the murders has been advanced.
   In addition to the four nominally independent homelands, six
``self-governing'' territories exist, which also rely heavily on
South Africa for economic help.

   Tropical storm Keith, just short of becoming the
year's sixth hurricane, soaked the Yucatan Peninsula on Monday and
moved into the Gulf of Mexico on a course expected to veer toward
Florida, forecasters said.
   ``It's a strong tropical storm on the borderline of a
hurricane,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane
Center.
   Keith's top sustained winds were hovering at about 65 mph, Sheets
said; 74 mph is the threshold for a storm to be upgraded to a
hurricane.
   At 8 p.m. EST, the storm was centered near latitude 23.1 north
and longitude 87.0 west, about 400 miles southwest of Fort Myers,
Fla. Forecasters said Keith was moving north at less than 10 mph and
was expected to turn east in the next 12 to 24 hours.
   ``It's moving toward the north, out in the south-central Gulf,''
said Sheets. ``The highest probability (of landfall) is the middle
of Florida's west coast'' late in the week.
   But Sheets emphasized that Keith is unlikely to become a storm on
the order of Gilbert or Joan, which devastated wide areas of the
Caribbean and Central America in September and October.
   ``I think it'll be just barely a hurricane,'' he said.
   On Monday, the storm's rains soaked an area from Mexico across
western Cuba to the Florida Keys, but spared the Yucatan Peninsula
city of Cancun from major damage, according to Alejandro Alvarado,
general manager of the Sheraton Hotel there.
   ``I just went around and you can see two or three things down on
the main street,'' he said. ``There's lots of water, lots of
puddles.''
   Alvarado said two or three light poles, apparently ones that were
being installed to replace those knocked down during Gilbert and
weren't yet firmly in place, had blown over. A few new palms fell as
well. He said hotels wee not be evacuated.
   The resort town is still recovering from Gilbert, which caused
extensive damage in September.
   While still a tropical depression, Keith passed south of Jamaica
late Friday and early Saturday, pouring almost 4 inches of rain on
Kingston in 24 hours. It also dumped rain on Honduras before heading
north into the Gulf.
   Tropical depressions are upgraded to tropical storms when their
top sustained winds reach 39 mph. Keith reached that status Sunday.
   Keith is the 11th named storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane
season, which runs from May 1 to Nov. 30. Five of the storms reached
hurricane strength, but only Gilbert and Joan did major damage.

Leadership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a meeting where more than 20 percent
of the leadership was ousted, the Central Council of the Hungarian
Trade Unions said Monday it no longer automatically supports
government austerity measures.
   ``While duly respecting independent government decisions,'' it
said in a statement, the unions ``will not assume responsibility
(for them), not actually having participated in that decision-making
process.''
   The Central Council, which has a membership of about 220, ousted
45 council members and appointed 37 new members, the state news
agency MTI reported. The meeting defined the fundamental tasks of
trade unions as ``protecting and representing the specific interests
of workers.''
   Reorganization and the change in basic policy were seen as a
reaction to an increasing trend toward installing new, independent
unions in communist Hungary, a spinoff development of economic and
social reforms here.
   MTI said the Central Council demanded that the government follow
a firm anti-inflation policy and called for earliest implementation
of wage reform.
   Living standards have fallen for months, mainly because of price
increases and a new tax system, and inflation is running at about 16
percent.
   On the Central Council's list of basic issues to be discussed
with the government at their next session Nov. 28 are living
standards, including real wages and income; employment, and social
policy, the agency said.
   Speakers at the council meeting were said to have stressed that
the government must declare a partnership with unions, ``as befits
discussions between equal partners.''
   Some speakers, not identified by MTI, said it was not true that
the trade union movement had lost the confidence of workers, but
admitted that ``some individuals, some measures and certain methods
have shaken the confidence of the membership.''
   It said said some speakers denounced as ``shocking'' unspecified
``curbs on trade union rights.'' There was no elaboration.

   A double murderer who escaped from a 153-year-old prison in New
Jersey by chipping through his cell and using a handmade ladder to
scale a wall was recaptured Monday following a daylong search.
   In California, four inmates who escaped from a jail with a rope
made of knotted bed sheets were still at large, and in New York
City, three foreign nationals who tried to break out of federal
custody were captured early Monday on a rain-soaked parapet of the
prison.
   In Trenton, Gonzalo Marrero, 37, was caught about three blocks
from the prison some 14 hours after his escape.
   Search crews had used helicopters, and rifle-toting officers
stood guard at blockaded streets, while others went door to door in
some neighborhoods. Police also had stopped all New Jersey Transit
trains in the early morning.
   Marrero had scaled the prison's outer wall about 4 a.m. using a
rickety, handmade 19-foot ladder. Two other inmates apparently
trying to escape with him had not yet climbed the ladder when they
were spotted by a tower guard, officials said.
   The three inmates apparently had chipped away at the wall of
their ground-level cell for some time, probably for several weeks,
said James Stabile, a spokesman for the state Department of
Corrections.
   They were housed in the prison's oldest section, built in 1835,
and once they chipped through the concrete they were able to push a
stone out of the wall, he said.
   Marrero was serving at least 60 years for the slayings of two
people killed during a restaurant holdup in Union City. He also was
convicted of related sexual assault, robbery and burglary charges,
said Stabile.
   In Santa Ana, Calif., authorities were searching for four inmates
who escaped from the Orange County Jail.
   Authorities were tipped to the escape about 8 p.m. Sunday when a
Santa Ana resident reported seeing a man in a prison jumpsuit about
a block away from the jail, said sheriff's Lt. Richard Olson.
   The four inmates were part of a recreation group meeting on the
jail roof who cut a small hole in the security fence and scaled down
the wall using the bed-sheet rope, he said.
   And in New York, federal investigators were trying to find out
how the foreign nationals got the hacksaw blade they used to saw
through the bars and plastic window of an eighth-floor room.
   They apparently used twine to drop to a fourth-floor setback of
the building, said U.S. Marshal Romolo J. Imundi.
   Marshals using a Fire Department ``cherry picker'' got the
prisoners down.

   For someone with a reputation as a conciliator,
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney certainly loves a good fight.
   He likes to portray himself as a statesman and Canada's most
competent leader, but he thrives on old-fashioned politicking.
   Mulroney appeared headed for another term in Monday's election,
the first time since 1953 that a Canadian leader was able to put
together consecutive majority governments.
   It was a slimmer margin this time than in 1984, when he led his
Progressive Conservative Party to one of the most impressive
landslides in Canadian history.
   The 49-year-old prime minister comes from a working class family
in Baie-Comeau, on the north shore of Quebec's St. Lawrence. He was
ambitious and built a successful legal and corporate career in
Montreal.
   He first tried for the Conservative Party leadership in 1976 but
was not successful until 1983. He also was first elected to the
House of Commons that year.
   Mulroney is the first bilingual native of Quebec to lead his
party, and he has used that fact skillfully in expanding the
Conservatives' base in that critical, largely French-speaking
province.
   Support for cronies was charged during his first years in office,
dropping his popularity drastically in the public opinion polls.
   Eight Cabinet ministers resigned in separate incidents, but by
the time he called the election Oct. 1 Mulroney had distanced
himself from the controversies and was able to point to an
experienced management team.
   He planned to stage the campaign on competency and the prosperity
that lasted through his term to create 1.3 million jobs in Canada.
   That all changed midway through the race when the free trade
agreement with the United States took off as the No. 1 issue,
turning the campaign into an emotional tide that for a time appeared
to be sinking Mulroney.
   He emerged from the protective cover of statesman to stage a
hard, direct fight.
   By the campaign's closing days, Mulroney was exuberantly telling
crowds at his rallies that they had a choice between opposition
Liberal Party ``John (Turner) the Ripper or Brian the Builder.''
   He described the opponents of the trade agreement he signed last
January with President Reagan as jittery, negative defenders of past
traditions that could not survive in the modern world.
   Mulroney, by contrast, saw himself as a ``nation builder,'' ready
to lead a competent Canada into full competition with the much
larger and more powerful United States.
   The phrase surfaced in the last of six hours of debate last
month, when Turner accused the prime minister of selling out Canada
with the free trade agreement.
   Mulroney replied that he carried through on the agreement to
build Canada, ust as his father had gone to northeastern Quebec 55
years ago where he and hundreds of other laborers built a small town.
   ``I believe that in my own modest way, I am nation building
because I believe this benefits Canada, and I love Canada,'' the
prime minister said.
   Although Turner was widely believed to be the winner of the
debate, the momentum did not carry through to the end of the
campaign.
   The prime minister is a Roman Catholic. He is married and has
four children.

   Today's Hollywood stars either don't know how
to dress or don't care what the public thinks about them, top
industry fashion designers say.
   Asked to name six Hollywood women with class and taste,
``Dynasty'' designer Nolan Miller could come up with two: Diahann
Carroll and Linda Evans.
   ``All you have to do is catch a plane to see how far fashion has
gone downhill,'' he said in the Nov. 26 issue of TV Guide magazine,
published here. ``You see actresses in jogging suits _ I can't
imagine someone working in their garden this way, let alone going on
a trip. They owe it to the public, I feel.''
   But some of those sweat pants are made of silk and cashmere, and
``Wheel of Fortune'' co-host Vanna White said fans prefer the casual
look.
   ``They think I'm a real person,'' she said. ``I mean, I wear nice
sweats. I'm presentable. And I think it's great because stars are
humans, just like everybody else.''
   Herbert Fink counts Corbin Bernsen, Harry Hamlin, Michael Landon,
Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith among the clientele at his four
shops on opulent Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.
   While some of his customers spend $40,000 to $60,000 yearly on
clothes, not everyone knows how to spend the money well, he said.
   ``Stars today are sort of a strange breed,'' he said. ``Some of
them reach stardom very quickly. Quite often they're from small,
unsophisticated areas, so they really have no idea of how to dress.
They wear the wrong colors, the wrong styles. They have all this
money and they almost don't know how to spend it.''
   Robert Turturice, Emmy-winning costume designer for
``Moonlighting,'' says Cybill Shepherd entrusts him either to design
or shop for all the clothes she wears privately.
   ``She knows the time when it's important to look a certain way
and she knows the times when it's OK to be relaxed,'' he said.
   For glamour, however, Turturice turns to Miss Shepherd's co-star,
Bruce Willis, who loves tuxedos.
   ``I think I've made eight or 10 of them so far for him,''
including one in black suede, he said.

   Dozens of Israeli soldiers smashed doors and
windows and overturned cars in a Palestinian refugee camp after
their bus was pelted by stones, Arab witnesses and state-run
television said Monday.
   An army spokesman said the incident, which occurred Sunday night
at the Kalandia camp north of Jerusalem, was being investigated.
   ``Apparently reserve soldiers were involved,'' said the army
official, who cannot be identified under military rules. ``If the
reports are true, the soldiers will be brought to court.''
   Reserve units have been activated to support the regular army in
trying to contain the 11-month-old Palestinian uprising against the
21-year Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Six Palestinian teen-agers suffered gunshot wounds Monday in
clashes with Israeli troops in Gaza, Arab hospital officials said.
   In Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, two Palestinian children, a
teen-ager and a 55-year-old woman were treated for injuries from
rubber bullets fired to break up demonstrations, the doctors said.
They insisted on anonymity.
   The army spokesman's office confirmed two woundings, both in the
Shati camp in Gaza City, and said it was checking the other reports.
   The incident at the Kalandia camp began at about 9:30 p.m. Sunday
when the bus carrying the soldiers was reportedly hit by stones. The
soldiers made a circuit through the camp, smashing house and car
windows, before returning to their bus and leaving, witnesses said.
   One camp resident, shown on television next to an overturned car,
said the soldiers came without warning.
   ``I looked out of the window and saw more than 25 or 30 army
people,'' he said. ``First they overturned this car. Then they
damaged my car, which is parked here every day.''
   He added: ``I didn't do anything. I'm an honorable man.''
   Witnesses said at least four cars were damaged.
   The witnesses said the soldiers also broke down the gates to
yards and the doors to homes and smashed windows with their rifle
butts.
   Rulf Van Uye, spokesman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency,
said ``well over 20 houses'' were reported by camp residents to be
damaged. The organization supervises aid to the refugees.
   Israel television said the soldiers were not assigned to the
Kalandia camp and were returning home after finishing duty
elsewhere. It did not elaborate.
   Also Monday, Shmuel Goren, coordinator for policies in the
occupied territories, told Israel television that West Bank schools
may be reopened Dec. 1. Most of the West Bank's schools have been
closed since last February, keeping more than 300,000 children out
of classes.
   ``We have never declared the school closures a policy,'' Goren
said. ``Our intention is, depending of course on the quiet, to
reopen the schools toward the first of the month.''
   The insurrection in the occupied lands has killed 314
Palestinians since it began Dec. 8. Eleven Israelis have also died.
   On Monday, 20 Palestinian leaders from the occupied territories
sent telegrams to foreign diplomats in Jerusalem, urging them to
recognize the Palestinian state declared last week by the Palestine
National Council in Algiers, Israel radio said.
   The message said the proclamation, which implicitly recognized
Israel, was proof of the Palestinian people's genuine wish for peace.
   Israel has rejected the proclamation, saying it was an attempt by
the PLO to deceive the world into believing it had moderated its
positions.

   Two lovers married to other people died in an
explosion on China's famous Great Wall, apparently in a suicide
pact. The blast injured a New Zealand tourist, the official Xinhua
News Agency said Tuesday.
   Police said a 33-year-old man and a 29-year-old woman detonated a
homemade explosive Monday, Xinhua said. The pair, both from Jilin
province in northeast China and both married to other people, were
seen hugging just before the 11:40 a.m. blast.
   A New Zealand woman, traveling with her sister in a tour group,
received head and possible eye injuries and underwent surgery late
Monday, the New Zealand Embassy said.
   An embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said her
injuries were ``potentially serious.'' Her name was withheld pending
notification of relatives.
   The woman and her sister had joined a tour group visiting China's
famed landmark at Badaling, a restored section of the wall about 40
miles northwest of Beijing. Other members of the group escaped
injury.

   Two fire inspectors resigned and a third was
suspended over ``shoddy'' handling of documents concerning an
Ashland Oil Inc. diesel fuel spill in January, a police official
said Monday.
   Allegheny County police Superintendent Robert Kroner said the
county fire marshal's office failed to properly review Ashland's
plans to reassemble a storage tank that collapsed Jan. 2 in nearby
Jefferson and spilled about 750,000 gallons of fuel into the
Monongahela River.
   Kroner said detectives also found that secret internal documents
concerning the tank were released to outsiders he would not name.
   Fire Marshal Martin Jacobs, 38, and Chief Inspector Charles
Kelly, 58, resigned after meeting with Kroner on Friday, Kroner said.
   Deputy Fire Marshal Edward Babyak, 52, refused Kroner's offer to
resign and has been suspended pending action by the Allegheny County
commissioners, Kroner said.
   ``Our investigation revealed some procedural mistakes, some work
actions that were not conducive to running a good fire marshal's
office, and some other items that we don't want to discuss at this
time,'' Kroner said.
   County Solicitor James Dodaro said the action against the three
officials has no bearing on whether the oil company followed proper
procedures in the reconstruction of the storage tank.
   Dodaro said the company never received nor paid for a certificate
of approval to build the tank.
   Kroner began investigating the fire marshal's office on Oct. 14
after he said Babyak produced a copy of a memorandum regarding the
tank during legal depositions that were part of Ashland Oil's
defense in a federal lawsuit.
   Since soon after the spill, Jacobs and his staff maintained that
they knew of no memo or any other correspondence giving Ashland
approval to rebuild the tank.
   On Oct. 14, according to Kroner, Ashland Oil attorneys had
possession of the fire marshals' internal memo, which never should
have been disclosed to anyone outside county law enforcement offices.
   Kroner said the memo claims that Kelly had inspected the area of
the tank, looked at some aerial photos of the tank farm, and had
approved ``the beginning or start of the project.''
   Ashland Oil has claimed it had approval to rebuild the tank on
the site.
   ``That's semantics, but it will be argued in court,'' Kroner
said. ``Up until these people left (the fire marshal's office), they
still denied they gave verbal approval.''
   Kroner said Jacobs had denied the existence of the internal memo
until last Thursday, when he admitted he found the original in his
desk on Nov. 3.

   The General Assembly is ready to demand a
worldwide end to colonialism and to condemn South Africa's rule of
South-West Africa.
   The assembly appears certain to approve a resolution Tuesday
declaring the 1990s to be the International Decade for the
Eradication of Colonialism. It also will probably pass a resolution
denouncing South Africa's control of South-West Africa, or Namibia.
   Last year, a resolution calling for Namibian independence passed
131-2, with seven abstentions. Only the United States and Britain
voted against it.
   South Africa was stripped of its voting rights in the General
Assembly in 1974.
   When the United Nations was established in 1945, 750 million
people lived without self-government in territories dependent on
colonial powers. By 1985, fewer than 3 million people still lived in
such territories.
   Talks are under way to grant independence to Namibia's 1.5
million residents and Western Sahara's 117,000.
   A tentative accord reached last week among South Africa, Cuba and
Angola paves the way for South Africa to grant independence to
Namibia, with the one-year transition possibly beginning early next
year. Cuba would remove its troops from Angola, where it is
supporting the Marxist government against U.S.- and South
African-backed rebels.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since it took the former German
colony during World War I.
   The United Nations also is mediating peace talks on the Western
Sahara between Morocco, which occupies most of the northwest African
territory, and the Polisario independence movement fighting the
Moroccan army.
   Under a tentative agreement, about 2,000 U.N. peacekeepers would
monitor a referendum that would result in Western Sahara's
independence or affiliation with Morocco.
   Less likely to be decolonized is the former Portugese colony of
East Timor. Indonesia invaded the 550,000-resident island in 1975.
   Britain continues to claim the Falkland Islands, insisting that
the 1,800 Falkland residents wish to remain subjects of Britain.
Argentina also claims the islands, and the two nations fought a war
over their possession in 1982.
   Puerto Rico was removed from the U.N. list of non-self-governing
territories in 1952, when it adopted a constitution and status as a
U.S. commonwealth.

<HEAD>U.N. Reorganization Ends British Dominance Of Arab-Israeli U.N.
Diplomacy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>

   Britain's traditional leadership of U.N.
diplomatic efforts in the Arab-Israeli conflict ended Monday with a
reshuffle of senior posts in the world body, an official said.
   U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes announced ``structural changes''
taking effect immediately, transferring Undersecretary-General
Marrack Goulding's responsibility for Arab-Israeli problems directly
to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Goulding, a Briton, will head the Office of Special Political
Affairs, with responsibility solely for all peacekeeping operations,
except for U.N. military observers in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   The changes end Britain's longstanding ``portfolio'' for
Arab-Israeli affairs at the United Nations, under which British
officials at the United Nations conducted most diplomacy in the
region.
   Under the reorganization, Perez de Cuellar is taking more direct
control over diplomacy and arrangment of peace accords, and
delegating the implementation of those arrangements to senior
officials.
   The first major step in that direction came in June and July when
Perez de Cuellar took charge of cease-fire negotiations between Iran
and Iraq.
   The U.N. mediation of the Afghan accords were conducted by Diego
Cordovez of Ecuador, who received credit for that settlement.
   Ms. Younes said the secretary-general is making the changes ``in
response to the increasing demand for his good offices in the
maintenance of international peace and security and for United
Nations peacekeeping operations.''
   She refused to characterize the shuffle as a promotion or
demotion for anyone involved.
   Goulding will also be in charge of ``the planning and conduct of
future peacekeeping operations,'' a formidable task with several
potential new missions on the horizon.

<HEAD>Utility Officials Originated Executive Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Utility officials originated the idea for
the executive order President Reagan signed giving the federal
government broad powers in nuclear power plant emergency planning, a
top executive of the stalled Seabrook nuclear project said Monday.
   There had been reports the order originated within the Department
of Energy, as well as speculation that New Hampshire Gov. John
Sununu _ a staunch Seabrook advocate whom President-elect George
Bush last week named his chief of staff _ had a hand in conceiving
the idea. Sununu had denied it.
   John Eichorn, chairman of the Seabrook joint owners' committee,
said neither the Energy Department nor Sununu came up with the
proposal.
   ``I'm sure it was the utility people,'' Eichorn said in an
interview at Seabrook after a news conference by Nuclear Regulatory
Commission Chairman Lando Zech.
   Zech said Seabrook could receive a low-power license by Christmas
if questions about plant owners' finances are resolved _ but he
indicated he considers that a big ``if.'' Zech noted that lead owner
Public Service Company of New Hampshire is under bankruptcy
protection.
   An NRC rule says plant finances do not have to be investigated
before a license is issued. Utility officials said they believed
Zech signaled that he personally favors waiving that rule, although
he made no clear statement on a waiver.
   A draft of the presidential order surfaced in June, sparking an
outcry from Seabrook foes and some supporters too. New Hampshire's
all-Republican congressional delegation, whose four members
conditionally support Seabrook, met with Reagan this summer and
asked him not to sign the proposal.
   But late Friday Reagan signed a revised version of the order,
which requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency to carry out
nuclear plant evacuation plans when state or local governments
refuse to cooperate.
   The order appears aimed primarily at Seabrook and the Shoreham
plant on New York's Long Island, both of which are completed but
stalled because of government opposition to evacuation plans. In
Seabrook's case, the opposition comes from neighboring
Massachusetts, which has six communities within Seabrook's 10-mile
emergency planning zone.
   Asked for details on how the order came to be signed in its final
form, Eichorn said, ``We were cut out of that process ... six to
nine months ago, and frankly I don't know where it's been in the
meantime.''
   Asked then what role Seabrook officials had in the order, Eichorn
said, ``We were interested in having it conceived.''
   ``I don't like taking the whole credit, but we certainly were
involved'' in originating the proposal, Eichorn said. He said
Shoreham officials also were involved.
   Zech, meanwhile, told reporters he had not seen the order and was
not sure how it could help Seabrook.
   Also on Monday, Gov.-elect Judd Gregg said he takes Sununu at his
word that he was not involved in getting Reagan to sign the order.
   During the weekend, Gregg suggested it was no coincidence that
Reagan signed the order the day after Sununu was named the next
White House chief of staff. But Sununu flatly denied any involvement.
   ``I take him at his word,'' Gregg said.

   A gunman killed a police officer
and wounded another Monday night in a town north of Belfast, then
fled on a motorcycle, police said.
   The slain officer, identified as 50-year-old William Monteith,
was filling in for a colleague on sick leave when he was shot in
Castlederg, 60 miles northwest of Belfast and close to the border
with the Irish Republic, police said.
   The second officer, identified only as Monteith's nephew, was
grazed in the head by a bullet, they said.
   The shooting took place shortly before the officers were to have
closed security barriers to protect the town at night from Irish
Republican Army bomb attacks. The British Broadcasting Corp. in
Londonderry said it had a telephone call claiming IRA responsibility
for the attack.
   The victim was the sixth policeman killed this year and the 257th
since the mostly Roman Catholic IRA began its violent struggle in
1969 to end British rule in the predominately Protestant province.

   The National Guard was patrolling in Tuscaloosa, Ala., as the
South cleaned up today from a barrage of nearly two dozen
late-season tornadoes and storms that killed at least two people and
damaged more than 150 homes.
   The same storm system carried high winds and heavy rains to parts
of Ohio and Pennsylvania on Sunday, ripping off the roof of an empty
school in southwestern Pennsylvania and toppling a 75-foot Christmas
tree in Pittsburgh.
   In the Caribbean, Tropical Storm Keith churned off Mexico's

   The slugfest bidding for giant RJR Nabisco Inc.
has gone into extra innings, with enriched offers from two existing
bidders, a record proposal from a new suitor and indications that
the multibillion-dollar free-for-all may get even wilder.
   A special committee of RJR Nabisco's board of directors announced
the new proposals late Sunday and said it was extending the deadline
for receiving further offers to buy the food and tobacco
conglomerate.
   Not only did the new buyout plans top previous bids, which
already were in the unprecedented $20 billion range, the committee
said every bidder could submit revised offers, signaling that the
hefty bids it had gotten so far might not be good enough.
   The committee, which is overseeing the auction of RJR, also has
told its own advisers to continue exploring ``all forms of
restructuring'' that could provide an alternative to the current
proposals.

   After their first post-election meeting, the
Democrats are determined to avoid wholesale revisions of their rules
but are ready to consider major changes in the presidential primary
and caucus calendar.
   The 1992 presidential campaign may see a drastically altered
Super Tuesday and find Iowa and New Hampshire deprived of their
first-in-the-nation status.
   ``Everybody thinks the thing ought to be shortened,'' said Texas
Democratic Party chairman Bob Slagle, echoing a sentiment expressed
by several of his colleagues.
   ``I'm going to tell you, everybody's damn tired of rules
changes,'' said Slagle. ``And I think the average Democrat thinks
we're absolutely insane if we get into another big battle about
rules.
   ``They want us to worry about how we're going to win elections.''

   You'd think an 81-year-old Texan would be
satisfied with a string of careers that reads: star of radio,
records, movies and TV, broadcast czar, real estate tycoon, baseball
mogul.
   But singing cowboy Gene Autry is back in the saddle with a new
pursuit: preserver of the American West, real and legendary, at a
museum underwritten with more than $50 million from his foundations.
   The Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, which opens Tuesday,
traces the West from prehistory to conquistadores to Lewis and Clark
to cowboys to Hollywood images.
   It's meant as a gift to the world, not a monument to himself,
said Autry, who first sang on radio in 1928, made 95 films, had a TV
show from 1950 to 1955, and cut 635 records, including ``Rudolph the
Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' ``Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine,'' and the
signature ``Back in the Saddle Again.''

<HEAD>Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore Shows Suffer in Ratings</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sentiment and old time's sake probably won't
cut any ice at CBS when it comes to Dick Van Dyke's and Mary Tyler
Moore's new shows.
   CBS, after all, is the network that dumped ``Frank's Place,'' oe
of the most critically praised series in recent years.
   Ratings did in ``Frank's Place'' and probably will be the undoing
of ``The Van Dyke Show'' and Moore's ``Annie McGuire.'' The shows,
which play back-to-back on Wednesday night, were in the bottom 10 in
the Nielsens last week.
   The only ratings hits so far this fall season are ABC's
``Roseanne'' and NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and ``Dear John.'' All three
have been in the top 10.
   ``Roseanne,'' starring Roseanne Barr and John Goodman as a
blue-collar husband and wife, is already pressing NBC's ``The Cosby
Show'' for the top spot.
   CBS' ``Murphy Brown,'' starring Candice Bergen in her series
debut as a star reporter on a TV newsmagazine, got a middling 14.7
rating for its premiere last week, about half what ``Cosby'' usually
gets, but respectable enough.
   The ``Murphy Brown'' rating was a considerable improvement over
its lead-in, ``Coming of Age,'' which got an 11.5 rating that same
night. But it wasn't as high as ``Designing Women,'' which got to
15.3.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 homes with televisions.
   ``Murphy Brown'' is funny, and Bergen has a flair for comedy. She
plays a mega-talent on the cusp of burnout. The show takes some
satiric swipes at television, such as its penchant for turning
glamorous airheads into reporters and giving executive positions to
people who only recently stopped sleeping in pajamas with feet in
them.
   But Van Dyke and Moore got off to slow starts, not only in the
ratings but with the critics as well.
   Van Dyke teams with son Barry in ``The Van Dyke Show'' as a
famous hoofer who comes to the rescue of his son's ailing theater in
a small Pennsylvania town. The show combines domestic comedy in the
son's home with the doings at the theater.
   The premise is a great excuse for the elder Van Dyke to display
his physical comedy and take a few pratfalls, and the show has grown
funnier episode by episode. In a recent show Van Dyke's grandson
writes a school paper naming his grandfather as his favorite person
because he's so much fun. Van Dyke tries to live up to his
grandson's expectations, while Barry feels rejected.
   Moore plays a widow with a teen-age son who marries a widower
with a teen-age son and a younger daughter in a ``Yours, Mine and
Ours'' kind of domestic comedy. But Moore also brings along a mother
who supports every left-wing radical cause that comes along, while
new husband Nick McGuire (Denis Arndt) has a father who would
consider William F. Buckley a liberal.
   ``Annie McGuire'' hit its stride in the third show, in which the
sister of Nick's late wife shows up. It turns out they'd once had an
affair _ which Annie worms out of him _ consummated in a guard shack
atop the Brooklyn Bridge. The show ends with a night shot of the
bridge and romantic cooing by Nick and Annie inside the guard shack.
   The pairing of Van Dyke and Moore on Wednesdays probably sounded
good on paper. After all, they were once America's favorite married
couple on ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' in the 1960s. Moore's own ``The
Mary Tyler Moore Show'' in the 1970s was a classic.
   The problem is that neither has had a hit show in a long time. A
whole generation of dial-twisters has grown up not really knowing
who they are except through reruns.
   If neither ever makes another appearance, however, their place in
television's pantheon is assured. ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' and
``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' rank among the best television series
ever made. Neither has to prove anything.

<HEAD>Staying In Touch With the Feelies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Staying in touch is what the Feelies are all
about.
   With their audience. And with their music.
   ``I'd rather appeal to 500 people for the right reasons than
5,000 for the wrong reasons. It's really what you mean to people,''
group member Glenn Mercer said.
   As for their music, Mercer said, ``We're reducing it to its basic
element. Pure energy and spirit. No intellect involved at all,
really.
   ``You don't want to make it seem that it's really being thought
about. You don't write a song about people being fascinated, it just
sort of comes out of you. No preconceived ideas.''
   On their third album, ``Only Life,'' the Feelies stick to the
same unfettered approach. The lyrics are terse, like telegrams;
every word counts. The singing is deliberately flat, stripped of all
emotion and irony. The listener is left to wonder if such words as,
``Nothing matters and what if it did,'' are to be taken at face
value or a criticism of that attitude.
   ``All of our songs are open to interpretation,'' Mercer said.
``I'd much prefer that to saying what the song's about. I think you
failed in a way if you have to say what a song's about. It really
takes away something from the song.''
   The arrangements keep to the basic rock 'n' roll combination of
drums, bass and guitars. Mercer said the Feelies were attracted to
the Stooges, the Modern Lovers and the MC5 _ groups more interested
in emotion than fancy chord structures.
   ``It was a combination. One, being that they're pretty simple
bands. They gave you the feeling you didn't have to take years of
music lessons, didn't have to buy really expensive equipment. You
could make music on a personal level. Another thing, they were cult
bands. Nobody else knew about them.''
   Bill Million, who co-writes the Feelies' songs with Mercer, liked
the spontaneous feel of those groups.
   ``The music had a lot of energy,'' he said. ``The Stooges sounded
like the guitar player just got a fender, a fuzz box and an
amplifier for Christman and just recorded the album two weeks
later.''
   But that changed in the 70s.
   ``Then it got away from that. Bands like Emerson, Lake and Palmer
and Yes, just the opposite really.''
   The Feelies were high school students in Haledon, N.J., when the
group was formed in 1976. The original lineup consisted of Mercer
and Million on guitars, Dave Weckerman on drums and percussion and
John J. on bass.
   They made their debut at Manchester High School in Haledon the
following year, not too successfully, Million remembered.
   ``The audience wasn't getting into what we were doing. Between
breaks, they asked us if they could use the instruments and play
stuff the audience actually wanted to hear. Then we started playing
CBGB's and Max's Kansas City.''
   And then the Feelies caught on. In 1978, they were called ``The
Best Underground Band in New York'' in a Village Voice cover story.
   ``Our audience went from about 12 to 600 people,'' Million
recalled.
   It seemed like a perfect fit when the Feelies signed with Stiff
Records and released their debut album, ``Crazy Rhythms,'' in 1980.
Here was the ``Best Underground Band'' and the ultimate new wave
record label, the home of Elvis Costello, Graham Parker and Nick
Lowe.
   The Feelies found out, however, that Stiff had the same priority
as the major record companies: the bottom line.
   ``They lectured us on how to write a hit single. It was like a
scene out of a movie,'' Mercer said.
   There were no hit singles, and despite excellent reviews, ``Crazy
Rhythms'' was a commercial failure and the Feelies disbanded in
1981. Not because they wanted to, Mercer noted.
   ``We didn't anticipate not playing for that long. The gigs got
further and further apart. We weren't thinking in turns of a
finality. We tend to go where things lead. We got involved in doing
different things. Not wanting to get involved with another bad
experience.''
   But the Feelies were not forgotten. Film director Jonathan Demme
had seen the band play at the Whiskey A Go Go in Los Angeles and
suggested that Mercer and Million write the soundtrack for Susan
Seidelman's ``Smithereens,'' released in 1982.
   ``He was a fan of the band. We kept in touch,'' Million said.
   The Feelies regrouped in 1983 with Brenda Sauter on bass, Stanley
Demeski on drums and Weckerman moving to percussion. In 1986, they
released ``The Good Earth'' on Coyote Records.
   The same year, the Feelies appeared in Demme's hit film,
``Something Wild,'' performing a cover of the Monkees' ``I'm a
Believer'' at a high school reunion.
   ``It was fun, a lot of hard work, but primarily fun. They made us
comfortable,'' Mercer said.
   But the Feelies are not looking to be a `fun' band. They're not
interested in being `fashionable.' They seek connection with their
fans through music.
   ``The people there are just there for the music. It's not like
going to the disco and getting dressed and making the scene,''
Mercer said.
   Added Million: ``There isn't a scene to make.''

   In the past decade, seven South American
nations pried themselves loose from the dictatorial grip of military
men.
   The march of freedom seemed inexorable.
   For the 210 million people in the seven nations _ Ecuador, Peru,
Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Suriname _ the return of
elected civilian government brought substantial personal freedom and
the restoration of human rights.
   Now the bright, shining shield of democracy is becoming tarnished.
   Growing disenchantment is evident in several countries, mostly
because of dashed expectations that an end to political repression
would bring economic improvement. It hasn't proved that simple.
   Nonetheless, democracy continues to enjoy substantial allure,
spreading into the few remaining enclaves of authoritarian rule.
   Chile's citizenry, rallying behind the slogan ``the joy is
coming,'' voted to end Gen. Augusto Pinochet's 15-year tenure as
president and hold elections in December, 1989.
   Only tiny Paraguay, run by aging, authoritarian Alfredo
Stroessner since 1954, remains totally outside the democratic fold.
   And despite the occasional rattling of sabers, and a few dramatic
but isolated and abortive barracks revolts in some countries, few
observers feel a military coup is likely anywhere on the continent.
   ``When you have inflation of 1,000 percent a year, you obviously
get unhappy people, but that doesn't mean they're inviting a return
to military rule,'' said Paul Sigmund, a politics professor at
Princton University and an expert on the Latin American armed forces.
   ``The military doesn't have a solution to these problems,'' he
said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. ``In the
1960s they thought they had the answers. They don't think they do
today.
   ``The notion that somehow they could do it better has been
disproved by their own experience.''
   In most South American countries economic mismanagement or
corruption by the politically inexperienced armed forces contributed
to the return of civilian rule. But some of the new civilian
governments have not proven much more adept at handling the
continent's most urgent, and persistent, problem: grinding poverty.
   Peru is considered the most volatile example. The inflation rate
is expected to surpass 1,000 percent, the economy is stagnant and
little if any headway has been made in improving the plight of a
hungry peasantry that feeds the ranks of a Maoist guerrilla
organization, the Shining Path.
   President Alan Garcia was considered one of Peru's new generation
of charismatic leaders when he took power in 1985. But his
popularity has plummeted because of what critics see as a
vacillating economic policy, especially since he alienated
conservative parties and businessman with a plan to nationalize
foreign banks in 1987.
   A recent survey by a Lima-based polling firm, Datum, found that
60 percent of Peruvians don't believe a military coup is likely
before Garica's term ends in 1990. But 28 percent do _ a sign that
democracy's foundations are less than rock-solid.
   ``If our problems continue to degenerate and if our institutions
continue demonstrating ineffectiveness, the totalitarian temptation
will visit us sooner or later,'' said a Peruvian political analyst,
Luis Pasara.
   Brazil and Argentina also are plagued by economic and social
instability, with sky-high inflation rates and tens of thousands of
workers striking daily for better pay, paralyzing many basic
services such as transportation and the mail.
   Brazilian newspapers publish regular reports of government
corruption, nepotism and waste. Retired Gen. Joao Figueiredo, the
last in a series of military presidents who ruled from 1964 to 1985,
told citizens to ``forget me'' when he handed over power to a
civilian. Now he says he is besieged by supporters asking him to
return to office.
   A popular bumper sticker in bustling Rio de Janeiro wistfully
recalls military rule: ``I was happy and I didn't know it.''
   President Raul Alfonsin of Argentina, another charismatic symbol
of democracy's return when he assumed office in 1983, was shouted
down by hecklers during a recent speech and his Radical Party trails
the Peronist Movement in popularity as the nation prepares for
elections in May.
   But such open expressions of dissent and dissatisfaction reflect
perhaps the most attractive aspect of life under the new
democracies. Freedom of expression and action has been a pledge kept
by the new governments.
   Most labor strikes take place unchallenged and the mass media
suffers few if any restrictions. The systematic arrest, torture and
killing of dissidents that took place when troops kept order under
military rule has been replaced by respect for basic civil and human
rights.

   Participation in party politics, labor federations and other
social groups both pro- and anti-government is active and
broad-based across the continent. The problem, according to some
analysts, is that such groups often work at cross-purposes.
   ``The primary problem in South America's democratic
reconstruction is the capacity to stabilize the political system,''
said the Chilean political scientist Juan Somavia. ``And the
capacity to stabilize the political system depends on achieving
basic accords among political parties and the different social
sectors.''
   Until a country achieves a working, stable political system ``the
possibility of a coup will remain present,'' said Somavia. He is
president of a Latin American study group sponsored by the Academy
of Christian Humanism.
   Somavia cited Uruguay as an example of a new democracy where
``political arrangement is basically working.'' Under Julio
Sanguinetti, who took office in 1985 and is considered one of the
most widely respected new presidents, Uruguay's political, labor and
business groups have reached a basic understanding that has provided
stability and economic improvement.
   Bolivia also is often cited as a democratic success story.
President Victor Paz Estenssoro has overseen an economic austerity
program that slashed annual inflation from an astounding 20,000
percent to about 10 percent.
   The Bolivian reforms were painful and politically risky, with
thousands of workers at unprofitable state-run mines laid off and
new taxes imposed. But the government's predictions of stability and
growth are slowly coming true and, as Bolivians prepare for new
presidential elections in May, no one considers a coup even remotely
possible in what traditionally has been South America's most
political unstable country.
   Not that the military hasn't made its presence felt. Paz
Estenssoro's predecessor, Hernan Siles Suazo, was kidnapped by
police and military officers in 1984 but freed hours later because
of a vast public and official outcry.
   In Ecuador, Gen. Frank Vargas Pazzos of the air force led two
short-lived revolts in 1986 before the government arrested him. A
year later, his followers abducted President Leon Febres Cordero and
held him for 11 hours, freeing him only after an amnesty was granted
to the rebellious Vargas Pazzos.
   Two brief but dramatic garrison revolts in Argentina, in 1987 and
1988, were defused when President Alfonsin agreed to limit human
rights trials of soldiers.
   In each crisis, it is widely accepted that the civilian
governments emerged strengthened.
   And although military rumblings persist, experts contend there is
a new, less threatening tenor.
   ``The saber-rattling is now related to issues that directly
affect the armed forces as an institution,'' such as human rights
trials and military spending, said Sigmund. He said they no longer
are taking public issue with general government policy, or
presenting themselves in the role of national saviors as they did in
the 1960s.
   Sigmund said he does not subscribe to the notion of an inevitable
political cycle of military and civilian rule.
   ``The pendulum has stopped swinging,'' he said.
   According to Somavia, the military also lacks the broad-based
civilian support for a takeover they enjoyed during the social
turmoil that affected many South American countries two decades ago.
   ``They have less social force,'' he said. ``No one is asking for
a coup.''
   But Somavia called the antagonistic relations between the
military and civilians ``a central problem that is going to be with
us for a very long time.'' Re-establishing a constructive
relationship in which the armed forces fully accept civilian control
``is something you can't accomplish in one government.''

ended in March 1985 when civilian Jose Sarney took office as
president, as the successor of Tancredo Neves who had been elected
by a military-appointed Electoral College but died hours before his
scheduled inauguration. Sarney had been named vice president. A new,
popular election is planned for November 1989.

<HEAD>Is it Japan or Nippon? Even Japanese Differ</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Japanese this country is called Nippon or
sometimes Nihon, and therein lies a seed of debate.
   ``Why is our country called Japan? Its `official' name is
Nippon,'' Kazuo Sato wrote in a letter published in September by the
Asahi Shimbun, provoking a minor flood of other readers' letters.
   The 26-year-old student from Tokyo argued that Japan should
``unanimously use Nippon'' as its own name on the international
level _ on athletes' uniforms when they compete abroad, for instance.
   One of the editors of Asahi's letters section thought the flurry
of response and comment was slightly alarming _ a possible sign of
nationalistic feelings at a time when Emperor Hirohito was gravely
ill.
   ``It is a bit scary that people are interested in such a issue
especially under the current situation, when the emperor's illness
has been affecting the country,'' he said, asking that he not be
named.
   But the editor thought it was good for the letters columns to be
used to debate the issue.
   ``I guess it would be easier if we could choose one (name), but
we cannot decide which should be legitimate,'' he said.
   Not everybody is sensitive about the country's name, or worried
that Japan is getting nationalistic.
   A foreign relations specialist and conservative writer, Hideaki
Kase, said, ``I think it's fine to have a few different names. There
seems to be no problem using either Japan or Nippon. ... It has
nothing to do with nationalism.''
   A Foreign Ministry official said there are no rules on how to
name countries in other languages, and he noted that Japan is
spelled Japon in Spanish and pronounced like ``hapon.''
   But what should Japanese athletes wear on their uniforms for
international competition? No one but the Chinese would be able to
recognize Japan's name written in the Chinese characters, which
Japan borrowed to make a writing system centuries ago, so it has to
be written in the Roman alphabet, called romaji in Japanese.
   Kayoko Yamamoto, a spokesman for the Japan Amateur Sports
Association, said the organization provides uniforms emblazoned
``Japan'' for international athletic events.
   ``For major international events, we use Japan as the country's
official name, because English is the most common language,'' she
said.
   But there's no firm rule, and some teams also go with Nippon.
   Masaaki Obana of the Japan Volleyball Association said the
national volleyball team has both Japan and Nippon uniforms but
players wear Nippon more often in international contests.
   ``Either way, they're our country's names. We don't think we
should be using only one of the two,'' Obana said.
   After Sato's letter was published, the volleyball association
received many inquiries asking which name is official, because
Japanese volleyball players wore their Nippon uniforms at the summer
Olympics games in Seoul, South Korea.
   The Asahi editor said the newspaper, Japan's second-largest
circulation daily, received about 10 letters on the issues.
   Karen Blahitka from Yamaguchi prefecture in southwestern Japan
wrote that she was against using Nippon because many languages as
well as Japanese translate foreign countries' names into their own
tongue, and English-speaking countries are no exception.
   ``For example, Bundesrepublik Deutschland is the Federal Republic
of Germany or colloquially West Germany in English, and `Nishi
Doitsu' in Japanese,'' she said.
   Teacher Tatsuya Akizuki, 36, wrote: ``It is a huge task to change
the way a country's name or person's name, which has already become
fixed in our daily lives, is pronounced.''
   ``If Japanese are told to accurately pronounce country names and
names of people in the languages of the respective countries, we
would be in trouble,'' he added.
   The origin of the name Japan is not certain, but researchers say
it probably came from the Malayan ``Japung'' or the Chinese
``Riben,'' meaning roughly land of the rising sun.
   Historians say the Japanese called their country Yamato in its
early history, and they began using Nippon around the seventh
century. Nippon and Nihon are used interchangeably as the country's
name.

<HEAD>Minor Parties Seek Inroads in Congress in Venezuela's Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With little hope of winning the
presidency, Venezuela's minor political parties are seeking to make
inroads in Congress in national elections Dec. 4.
   They are counting on a major defection from the nation's two main
parties.
   The small parties acknowledge that their 23 presidential
candidates _ including a handful of leftists, a witchdoctor, some
retired military officers, and a former Central Bank president _
don't have a chance in the presidential balloting.
   But they say widespread voter discontent with the government's
Accion Democratica (AD) and the main opposition party, Copei, will
be shown in split-ticket voting that could yield a Congress of 182
deputies and 44 senators with no single party in control.
   It would mean a major change in recent Venezuelan voting patterns
with longer-term effects as the nation slowly decentralizes its
political system, they said.
   ``People are not happy with AD or Copei but they recognize their
candidates have the best chance to win the presidency. But their
true electoral preference will be shown in the congressional vote,''
said Freddy Munoz, secretary general of Movement to Socialism (MAS),
Venezuela's third largest electoral force.
   Most political analysts agree small parties, the larger of which
are left of center, are likely to post gains in Congress.
   They note that voters associate the country's economic slump,
about to enter its eighth year, with center-right Copei and
center-left AD.
   The crisis, caused by low oil prices, began under a Copei
administration and has continued under current AD administration of
President Jaime Lusinchi.
   Polls indicate that while over 75 percent of the electorate
express a preference for either AD's frontrunning candidate Carlos
Andres Perez or Copei's Eduardo Fernandez, only half the eligible
voters have decided to vote for one of the two parties'
congressional slates.
   The disaffection has been exacerbated by unexciting campaigns. AD
politicians bemoan the ``triumphalism'' of the party's candidates,
who have depended on Perez's popularity to sweep them into office
rather than campaigning for themselves.
   MAS, on the other hand, adopted a campaign strategy that
de-emphasized the campaign of its presidential candidate, former
guerrilla Teodoro Petkoff, in favor of its congressional candidates.
   The ticket-splitting would be a major change from recent
Venezuelan voting patterns.
   In the six elections since 1958, AD and Copei alternated in the
presidency. Since 1973 the two parties combined have garnered not
less than 88 percent of the presidential vote.
   Minor parties had just 27 seats in the last 200-member House of
Deputies, including 10 from MAS. AD had 113 seats and Copei 60 _ and
some of the small parties ally themselves with AD or Copei.
   But even if MAS gets around 15 percent of the congressional vote,
as some analysts predict, it likely would have little impact on the
direction of Venezuelan politics in the short term.
   With Venezuela's overwhelmingly strong executive branch,
congressional action is normally limited to making minor adjustments
to presidential initiatives.
   But ticket-splitting could mean a revival of MAS and the ability
of small national or regional parties to survive until the
presidential election in 1993.
   Their survival takes on more significance as the big parties
reluctantly allow some decentralization of power to take place.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ For most of the 70 years since the Soviet Union
came into being, Soviet history was tailored and falsified to suit
the rulers in the Kremlin and the party dogmatists. In today's freer
atmosphere, long suppressed truths are allowed to emerge, and the
nation is trying hard to come to grips with them.

   In a cool pine glade north of the Byelorussian
capital of Minsk where Soviet families used to come to picnic,
stroll or play chess, two schoolboys made a grisly discovery.
   Digging around in the Kuropaty forest during their May Day
holiday last spring, the boys unearthed some human skeletons that
started a grim search for historical truth.
   Since then, archaeologists have made wholescale excavations, and
researchers now estimate that more than 100,000 people were shot and
buried in mass graves there during the political purges of the late
1930s.
   In the Soviet Union, the past never lies far beneath the surface.
History is an abiding obsession here.
   For the Soviet nation, whose 70-year existence fits into a single
human lifespan, the past surges up again and again to influence the
present. In the more open atmosphere permitted by President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, Soviets are trying to come to
grips with their nation's often dark, troubling and contradictory
legacy _ and use it to map a course for the future.
   ``People write heatedly and passionately about the events of 50
years ago as if they were writing about today's problems,''
Gorbachev said this year. ``There is nothing surprising about this.
They are talking about the most important thing for us ... about how
it could happen that, along with the heroic achievements of the
people, crimes against them became possible.''
   World War II is re-fought several times a week on state-run
television, in movies and documentaries. Rainy fall days barely thin
the throngs outside the red brick gates of Moscow's Novodevichy
Cemetery, where Soviets come to see the tombs of departed Kremlin
leaders who once fixed the course of their lives.
   History is never far behind the headlines:
   _ Armenians waging a long, noisy campaign to annex the
Nagorno-Karabakh region of neighboring Azerbaijan are contesting a
Soviet government decision made in 1923 that awarded the
predominantly Armenian region to Azerbaijan.
   _ In the three Baltic republics, mass movements arise to demand
greater autonomy from Moscow. Some Estonians, Latvians and
Lithuanians even seek total independence. Demonstrations are
triggered by each anniversary of the 1939 Hitler-Stalin pact that
awarded control of the states, then sovereign nations, to the Soviet
Union, which absorbed them.
   _ Gorbachev, embarked on a bold course to revitalize the nation's
economy, trim its bureaucracy and get the citizenry more involved in
decision-making, rarely speaks publicly without citing the
stagnation of Leonid I. Brezhnev's rule and the harsh administrative
grip imposed by dictator Josef V. Stalin.
   In the atmosphere of freer inquiry and debate fostered by
glasnost, the study of the past has become both an eagerly shared
passion and a bitter, divisive issue for Soviets, with the top man
in the Kremlin out in front with the calls for increased candor.
   ``One cannot agree with those who propose that we forget our
history or use only a certain part of it,'' Gorbachev said in
January. ``All this enables us to draw lessons for the present ...
and to disclose more fully the potential of socialism and its
values.''
   But more than 3{ years into Gorbachev's rule it still isn't clear
whether glasnost will bring unhampered historical scholarship and
the right to differ on fundamental questions or just substitute one
Kremlin orthodoxy for another.
   Gorbachev himself recently chaired the meeting of a special
Communist Party commission preparing a new ``concise history'' of
the party, showing how keenly he wants his influence to be felt in
the new Soviet view of the past.
   School history texts, full of ritual self-congratulations,
radiant socialist futures and cartoon-like heroes and villains, were
thrown out and are being rewritten.
   Windows on the past, shut tight for years by the censor, have
been opened. Soviets now jostle at lending libraries for works about
the long-concealed ``blank spots'' in their history. The book most
in demand is Anatoly Rybakov's ``Children of the Arbat,'' a novel
about the bloody swath cut through society by Stalin's political
terror that left its traces of horror at Kuropaty.
   And history in the Gorbachev era has meant the humbling of the
memories of men who, while alive, were spoken of as the worthy
spiritual heirs of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin.

<TEXT>
   A Leningrad monument to Brezhnev was spirited away at night. A
vandal at Moscow State University spilled ink on a memorial plaque
to former Kremlin ideologue Mikhail A. Suslov. The city of Izhevsk,
which once bore the name of Dmitri F. Ustinov, spent more than $3.2
million to wipe the late defense minister's name off street signs,
official stationery and railway timetables.
   For Gorbachev and his allies, history matters because it bares
the mistakes of past Kremlin leaders and points away from what
Gorbachev wants to avoid: the totalitarianism and bureaucratic
choke-hold on society that marred Stalin's rule, the erratic
capriciousness of Nikita S. Khrushchev, the complacency and moral
rot under Brezhnev.
   ``It is said that people learn from mistakes, and nations learn
from tragedies. Let us learn,'' one author, L. Ovrutsky, said in a
newspaper article on Soviet history this year.
   Gorbachev also seeks to right what he regards as historical
injustices. By rehabilitating some of the revolutionaries and
visionaries Stalin destroyed, Gorbachev has been able to resurrect
their once-discredited ideas as ideological underpinning for his own
reforms.
   Training glasnost's spotlight back into the past has had
sensational results. Among the revelations this year:
   _ Brezhnev reportedly was clinically dead at one point in 1976
but recovered at least partially and remained Soviet president until
his death in 1982.
   _ Stalin was described by one Soviet newspaper as a paranoid
whose brain was damaged by a stroke.
   _ Nikolai I. Bukharin and other Stalin foes shot as ``enemies of
the people'' in the 1930s are now said to have been framed.
   Such reports have startled a country long fed a diet of
reassuring Kremlin communiques.
   ``In the past two years, I have learned more than I did in the
previous 50 years of my life,'' one middle-aged Muscovite recently
told a newspaper.
   Predictably, the questioning, doubts and criticism, where before
there was often only praise, have produced a backlash among Soviets
who feel that their entire history, even the building of socialism
itself, has been besmirched.
   ``I would very much like to understand: who needs, and why, to
have every prominent leader of the party Central Committee and the
Soviet government compromised after he leaves office and discredited
in connection with his actual or supposed mistakes and calculations
... Where did we get this passion for squandering the prestige and
dignity of the leaders of the world's first socialist country?'' a
Leningrad teacher wrote in the Sovietskaya Rossiya daily earlier in
the year.
   The official response to that letter, signed by Nina Andreyeva,
demonstrated how explosive the issue of history in the Soviet Union
can be _ and the limits still drawn on historical scholarship.
Pravda, the party's principal organ, attacked its fellow newspaper
for printing a document lauding Stalin and forced Sovietskaya
Rossiya to recant by printing the Pravda attack.
   Despite glasnost, Stalin or Brezhnev are rarely defended in
print. Since Gorbachev's policy is avowedly the opposite of theirs,
praise for his predecessors could be, or might seem to be, an attack
on Gorbachev or his policy of change.
   But on the whole, glasnost has meant a dramatic widening of the
historical field, and a coming to terms with some of the
uncomfortable truths of the Soviet past that long lay hidden or were
played down. Historian Fyodor Burlatsky was referring to the 1953-64
Khrushchev era, but might well have been speaking of all Soviet
history, when he said:
   ``For a long time, a very long time, talking about those stormy
years was not accepted practice. It was as if someone's hand had
ripped out an entire chapter from our chronicle.''

<DATELINE>MAGADAN, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Asir Sandler remembers the
interrogation, the death sentence never carried out and the tiny
knots he tied in pieces of string to remind him of what he saw in a
Stalinist labor camp north of this capital of the Gulag.
   Trudy Richter, a German Communist whose nationality couldn't save
her, remembers the filthy, crowded ferry ride from Vladivostok to
Magadan, and her husband who never returned.
   This city of the Soviet Far East, like so much of the Soviet
Union, is torn between the urge to remember and the desire to forget
Josef Stalin's purges that put it on the map and gave it the fearful
reputation it still is trying to outlive.
   Thousands of Stalin's political prisoners were sent through
Magadan, nothing more than a couple of stone buildings and wooden
barracks in the 1930s, on their way north to the gold mines and
labor camps of the Kolyma region of the far northeast.
   Sandler, 71, a native of Baku in the warm southern republic of
Azerbaijan, spent the last several of his 10 years of labor camp as
prisoner M-1-866 in a camp in the Kolyma region.
   He met with foreign reporters in Magadan recently to show them
how he made the coded knots in pieces of string to record what he
saw. Those strings, hidden in the camp and smuggled out by a means
he still won't reveal, gave him some of the materials he has used to
write about camp life.
   ``Your life there was hanging by a hair every minute,'' he said.
``You could be strangled by criminals for your portion of water and
your piece of bread.''
   Half-starved prisoners nevertheless were required to be neat, and
even a loose corner on his number badge could mean 10 days in a
punishment cell on only 200 grams of bread and a cup of boiled water
a day.
   Sandler arrived in the Magadan region in 1947, already a prisoner
for many years after being accused of spying for Germany during
World War II. During a long interrogation, the charge eventually was
reduced to carrying a poem in his pocket that insulted Stalin.
   A military tribunal in Baku sentenced him to be shot, but allowed
him to ask for clemency and then let him sit for another 90 days
while the stress built up and his weight dropped from 70 kilograms
(154 pounds) to 42 kilograms (92 pounds).
   In the end, he realized ``it was better to be a spy than to
threaten Stalin,'' Sandler said. ``I understood that if I didn't
sign what the investigator wanted, I wouldn't live another two
months.''
   Stories such as Sandler's have given Magadan a reputation
difficult to outlive.
   ``Magadan is regarded as a city of sad fate. This we remember and
we know,'' Mayor Gennady Dorofeyev told the journalists. ``We can't
reject this; we can't hide it.''
   But when asked about building a monument to Stalin's victims, as
Moscow and other cities are planning, officials point out the city
already has a monument to Eduard Berzin. Berzin, an official of the
secret police organization that was responsible for opening up the
Far East with political prisoners, himself fell victim to Stalin.

   MOSCOW (AP) _ Mikhail S. Gorbachev is leading his nation in a
reassessment of its past that he calls indispensable for charting
its political future. How do Soviets now view the 70 years of their
country's history? Here is a sampler of recent comment:
   
   THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION _ ``Maybe the revolution was a mistake?...
Such are the doubts of many people, and to be quiet about it is to
drive the sickness inside.'' (author Boris Kulikov, writing in Nash
Sovremennik magazine)
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   JOSEF V. STALIN _ ``Under Stalinism, order was no myth. But now
that Comrade Stalin is no longer with us, he's being blamed for
everything. As if he personally made arrests, presided over `troika'
sessions (summary trials), made denunciations etc.'' (Ya. Mesechkov,
a reader of Ogonyok)
   ``Stalinism is the curse that is hanging over our people and
reducing to nothing the efforts of one generation after another.''
(closing words of the film ``The Process'')
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WORLD WAR II _ ``We often portray combat operations in a
one-sided fashion that leaves the enemy _ his real power and
aggressive intentions _ outside the picture. But millions of Soviet
people did not die in a tilt with windmills! ... There is the matter
of our allies. Usually, very little has been said about them.''
(Dmitri A. Volkogonov, head of the Defense Ministry's Military
History Institute)
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NIKITA S. KHRUSHCHEV _ ``A people that had once elevated Ivan the
Terrible ... could not accept, after Stalin, a public figure devoid
of mystical magic, an earthbound and fallible leader who was subject
to mistakes and delusions.'' (historian Fyodor Burlatsky)
   ``He was reared in the atmosphere of the `great leader syndrome.'
He breathed in its vapors, and did not find in himself the strength
to resist the destructive feeling that he was a chosen person and
absolutely infallible.'' (author Boris Yasilyev, writing in Izvestia)
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LEONID I. BREZHNEV _ ``At one time in early 1976, he was
clinically dead and after being revived, had to wait for three
months for his thinking and speech to normalize ... The Soviet
leader's senility, infirmity and sickness became a subject not so
much of compassion and pity on the part of Soviet citizens, but
rather of irritation and mockery ...'' (historian Roy Medvedev)

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Methamphetamine _ ``crank'' _ acts like cocaine
but is cheaper to make. It's also dangerous. Crank is cooked from
toxic chemicals, often in motels, rented houses and trailers that
are ruined as a result. The chefs are careless outlaws, not
chemists, and in the Pacific Northwest, their numbers are growing.

   Donna Newman and Bill Blocher expected the
house they bought for $13,800 from the Department of Housing and
Urban Development to provide a steady rental income when they
retired.
   What they didn't expect was the letter from the sheriff's office,
ominously headed: ``Notice of Potential for Unknown Health Hazard.''
   Blocher had let his son move into the aging, two-level,
wood-frame house. Police say the son and four other people turned it
into a clandestine lab for making methamphetamine, a crystallized
powder that acts much like cocaine.
   The June 15 letter came five days after police raided the house.
Suddenly, Newman and her husband were absentee caretakers of a
building that might be contaminated with potentially toxic chemicals
used to make ``meth.''
   ``Speed cookers,'' once found maiexist, that it is
real.''
   However, security on the bomber program will remain tight, and no
data has been revealed on specifics of the aircraft's capabilities.
   ``We're not going to give all that away,'' Mullaney said. ``It
remains a classified program.''
   Stealth fighters reportedly have been flying for several years,
but only at night. A photo of that plane was released because it is
ready for daylight flights, officials said.
   The stealth bomber, so-called because it is intended to be
extremely difficult to detect on enemy radar, has been described as
a sleek, dark, flying wing with no sharp angles to reflect radar and
built of exotic composite materials, some of which will absorb radar
rather than reflect it.
   Flight tests will be conducted at Edwards Air Force Base, about
70 miles north of Los Angeles in the Mojave Desert. The Air Force
said when the drawing was released that the maiden flight would be
the short hop from the plant at Palmdale to Edwards.
   The B-2 is described as an all-altitude penetration bomber, as
opposed to the B-1 bomber, which is designed to penetrate enemy air
defenses at low altitudes.
   ``This is a bizarre-looking machine,'' said Bill Sweetman, an
aviation writer and editor who wrote ``Stealth Aircraft: The Secrets
of Future Airpower.'' ``This is going to be a really unusual,
sinister-looking aircraft.''
   The Air Force says the plane is 69 feet long, about the length of
an F-16 fighter plane, and has no tail. Its wingspan, at 172 feet,
is almost as wide as the aging B-52.
   ``It is revolutionary,'' Mullaney said. ``It is a unique
aircraft.''
   In addition to being difficult to detect on radar, it has become
increasingly difficult to estimate the final price of the stealth
bomber. Recent estimates for the 132 aircraft requested by the Air
Force have climbed as high as $68.5 billion, according to the
General Accounting Office.
   The B-1B came in somewhere around $250 million apiece, before
modifications. Stealth bombers could cost twice as much.
   Cost questions aside, Sweetman said the stealth bomber sitting in
the Palmdale hangar represents ``a massive achievement in aerospace
technology.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Twenty years ago, an anonymous donor left an
injured hawk on Leonard Soucy's doorstep. Whoever did it picked the
right house. Soucy has since patched up thousands of birds, not to
mention the occasional lame duck.

   It is hard to pinpoint just when a man
decides to turn his back yard into a repair shop for wrecked birds.
   For Leonard Soucy it probably came 20 years ago when an anonymous
someone, like an unwed mother abandoning her newborn in a basket at
the church door, left a red-tailed hawk with a broken wing in a
cardboard box on his front stoop.
   It was a challenge Soucy couldn't say no to. He still can't.
   That is why his current back yard is an intensive care facility
of assorted cages _ some the size of boxcars _ in which he endeavors
to restore to the wild squadrons of sick and injured owls, hawks,
eagles, falcons and selected songbirds. And the occasional lame duck.
   In earthly terms appropriate to a pirate's parrot, Soucy tells
how birds have taken over his home, his bank account, his job and
even his wife, Diane.
   ``Birds have eaten me up. They've consumed my life.''
   These are the birds who came to dinner, as it were, for whose
convalescence Soucy flies in 10,000 crickets a week from a Tennessee
breeder, millions of grub worms from California, grasshoppers galore
from Georgia and 150,000 rodents a year.
   ``I have 10,000 meal worms here right now, and they're just
snacks,'' exclaims Soucy to whom sotto voce is an abomination.
   ``This cost $100,000 last year. If the food wasn't donated, it
would have cost $250,000. Just one rat costs $2.50. A mouse is
$1.09. But I have to do it. No one else is going to.''
   Soucy may have as many as 500 recovering birds at a time in his
100,000 cubic feet of cages. There's a barred owl on the mend from
entanglement with a kite string. A golden eagle with a broken wing.
Hawks shot by what Soucy calls unprintable ``slobs.'' Orphaned birds
raised from infancy. An oriole that will winter over because it did
not recover until after the last flight south.
   Soucy still tries to sandwich his profession as a self-employed
tool and die pattern maker around a hobby that was once a Sopwith
Camel and is now a B-52. This sometimes requires him to go to his
paying job at 2 a.m. There are emergency calls at all hours.
   ``A bird gets hit, falls out of the nest. It doesn't belong to
the police. Not the dog warden. Doesn't belong to anybody. So they
say `Call Soucy.''' A screech owl flies down a chimney and catches
fire. Call Soucy. A goshawk crashes through a picture window and
lands dazed on a coffee table. Call Soucy.
   ``There's nobody else to pass them to. The bird stops here.''
   Last year, Soucy's busiest yet, 1,485 wild birds ended up on his
doorstep. This included 240 raptors, the carnivorous birds he
specializes in. About half recovered and were returned to the wild.
Repair is not cheap.
   ``To do an intramedulary fusion of a bird's wing bone with a pin
can cost $400 for the operation. Post-op care can approach $1,000.''
   Fortunately Soucy has two understanding veterinarians nearby _
Drs. Andrew Major in Plainfield and Ken Jacobsen in Basking Ridge _
who donate their surgical skills.
   ``We can keep a bird alive 90 percent of the time. But can we
restore it 100 percent? The bird won't make it in the wild if it's
only 75 percent. So we keep about 100 for educational lectures at
schools and such and euthenize the rest.''
   Soucy's preoccupation with raptors is evolutionary. He was born
in Cedar Grove, N.J., 57 years ago when it had some open land, not
the 40,000 people it's packed with today. He learned nature from an
uncle, a hunter, a species Soucy has no quarrel with despite the
many gunshot-maimed birds he's treated.
   ``No competent, moral hunter will shoot hawks and owls. The
bleeping slobs do.''
   His interest was piqued years ago when he read an article in
Audubon magazine on hawks. So he and Diane went out to Hawk Mountain
in eastern Pennsylvania to see the fall migration when thousands of
raptors may fly by in a day riding the thermals south.
   ``I couldn't imagine 1,000 hawks in the whole world much less
overhead.''
   Gunners used to shoot hundreds of birds in a day at Hawk Mountain
just to try their aim. This ended in 1934 when a wealthy woman from
New York, Mrs. Rosalie Edge, acquired the mountain as a refuge for
the birds and birdwatchers. Cape May, an even bigger migrating
junction at the tip of New Jersey, was another gunnery range. This
stopped when the federal government outlawed shooting raptors in
1972.
   By then Soucy and Diane had been in the bird repair business for
four years. They had rehabilitated that first red tail and released
it. One thing led to another, so they bought a home in semi-rural
land next to the Great Swamp Wildlife Refuge here. It started out as
a backyard hobby, a gesture to right some of the wrongs committed by
the biggest raptor of them all, man.

   ``The stupidity of man not doing better gradually enraged me. All
things on earth are valuable to us because they help stabilize the
darn thing. I was raised to think man owned the world. We've got to
get out of this idea because we're a part of it. It's all our world.
We've got to take care of Momma Earth.''
   He had no illusions about it being easy.
   ``Historically this country has a love-hate relationship with
raptors. We put the bald eagle on our national seal. But there used
to be a bounty on them. People don't care if a robin kills a worm.
But it's what's being killed that matters. A fox that kills a
chicken is a bad fox. If it kills a snake, it's a good fox. To
hunters a hawk that killed a rabbit was a bad thing, so they killed
the hawk and then the rabbit. Farmers thought raptors were vermin,
but very, very, very few hawks will kill chickens. But that's a hard
sell.''
   Soucy accepts raptors for what they are, meat-eaters in nature's
scheme, just like the folks at Burger King.
   ``Raptors are truly remarkable animals. An owl can see a lighted
match a half-mile away. A hawk two miles up can see a rabbit and
know it's a rabbit. They probably have the best eyesight in the
whole world.'' He admires their efforts to try and adapt to a world
not of nature's making. For study he's trapped a snowy owl
underneath the wing of a Concorde jet parked at Kennedy airport.
   As Soucy's reputation spread so did the cages out back. But he's
a realist. He will not turn away a tearful youngster who shows up
with a baby phoebe that has fallen out of the nest. But his eye
cannot be on every sparrow.
   ``Obviously there are limits.''
   He and Diane learned as they went along, designing cages and
treating the patients so as not to make permanent welfare cases of
their ailing flock. There are triumphs.
   ``In 1982, which happened to be the national year of the bald
eagle, one of them fell out of the sky. It ended up here. I took it
to Bill Hobby, a local vet, and he got an IV into the bird. He found
it had too much mercury in its blood. Six weeks later we flew him
down to Chesapeake Bay in a donated Lear jet with an NBC-TV crew and
returned a healthy eagle to the sky.''
   In time the big birds began running into big money. ``It costs
$175 to air freight a recovered osprey down to Florida after
migrating season. I've shipped ferruginous hawks to Arizona. When it
looked like Diane was going down in a heap and I couldn't afford it
any more, a friend said we should incorporate.''
   They are now The Raptor Trust, eligible for tax-exempt donations.
A local lumber company donates wood for cages. AT&T, which has huge
office complexes in the area, gave $7,000 for a new cage. In the
summer the Soucys have five full-time staffers and 25 volunteers.
The hobby has become one of the 10 biggest bird recovery operations
in the nation.
   ``We took a five-day vacation this year, the first in 16 years. I
hired Jean Stamy, an ex-teacher, to show school groups around. I
told her she'd work harder and be paid less if she came to me. I
kept my promise.
   ``The reality is, how big can we get? We don't charge for our
services _ whom do you send a bill to? _ so we have to beg. That's
what I've become. A beggar.''
   Soucy has raised $185,000 to buy the property next door for more
space and an educational center to make a hard sell a little easier.
   ``I like to think we're setting an example. In the last 20 years
Americans have gone back to being more intolerant of nature, gone
back to their computers and Porsches. If they had more sympathy for
the planet that sustains us, maybe they wouldn't puke on their world
so much.
   ``I figure I've put 100,000 hours into all this, and I've never
taken a dime out,'' said Soucy strolling among the cages under the
penetrating stare of his patients.
   Maria, the golden eagle, a permanent resident, eyed him
dispassionately. Three snowy owls watched unblinkingly. A clutch of
great horned owls, as stately as Supreme Court justices in a group
portrait, perched motionless on a dead limb. Their thoughts about
Leonard Soucy, if any, were inscrutable. His weren't.
   ``I've thought weekly I'd finally give it up. Maybe something
died you'd worked hard over. Twenty years I've been out in the back
yard putting broken birds back together. Where did all that time
go?''
   He stared back at the owls.
   ``I don't think I would do it all over again.''
   He reconsidered. ``I don't know.''
   He brightened.
   ``But I've probably got more `God bless you's' in my life than
most people.''

   One night David Bromberg, who'd played guitar live with Arlo
Guthrie on his hit ``Alice's Restaurant'' on New York
``underground'' radio station WBAI, and Walker were ``hobnobbing
around in the Village.'' Bromberg persuaded Walker to go to WBAI and
perform ``Mr. Bojangles.'' The station recorded it and kept playing
it. People listening to Circus Maximus in Greenwich Village would
ask who wrote ``Mr. Bojangles.'' Walker was hot. He says, ``I cut
three albums in about a five-month period.
   ``I didn't like the city atmosphere of cutting records. I decided
I wanted to get out. I live my life. In the '70s I was in Texas.
Doing what I wanted to do, I wound up having the strongest part of
my career.
   ``I don't have a career. I have an adventure with a guitar.''
   With his Lost Gonzo Band, Walker cut four records between 1974
and '78. ``Viva Terlingua'' became his biggest-selling album.
   These days, Walker travels with another Texas
performer-songwriter and their guitars. He says, ``I go out and work
about 10 days a month, on average. Any more money than that and
you've got to pay the IRS all of it.
   ``The Charlie Daniels Band goes on those huge endurance tours. He
has three semi-trailers and two buses.
   ``You can play it on the guitar and people will be touched. I
played two nights in a beautiful wooden concert hall in Hanover,
N.H., with 1,100 people there. Three nights later I was in Keene,
N.H., a theater that held about 750 people. I had two guitars and my
songs and stories. People had a great time. You need to have a
well-rounded repertoire. The symplicity of doing it is enjoyable. It
leaves room for profit for the promoter and the artist.
   ``Steve Fromholz opens for me. He wrote `I'd Have To Be Crazy'
for Willie Nelson. I've cut a duet with Willie, one of Steve's
songs, `The Man with the Big Hat's Buying.' Steve and I have been
doing it for the last few concerts as an encore and it has been
knocking them out.
   ``It was time to do something simple again.
   ``I was running myself pretty ragged through the 1970s with the
Gonzo Band. We did 150 or 200 shows a year, an album every six
months and were partying pretty hard while we were touring. We'd
party at night, travel, do a show. We had two chartered planes with
us. If we were within an hour's flight of New Orleans we'd fly there
and party in the French Quarter till 5 in the morning. We were
tearing it up. We were on that kind of roll. We thought it was fun.
   ``In 1979 I found out I had five years with no tax records. My
people had paid some but the records were shoddy. I owed quite a bit
and penalties. I had a lot of that to catch up.
   ``When I hit 1980 I decided it was time to make some lifestyle
changes and patch some holes up. I had a 2-year-old daughter. I
started scaling down a bit, some tours with the band and some solo.
I got my wife more involved with the accounting and myself more
entangled with the business end of it. She has been my manager since
1985.
   ``I had to re-mortgage the house. This is the first year since
1968 I don't owe anything. I'm actually able to make some gains.
   ``Jessie Jane is 10 now and Django Cody is 6. I wrote `Django's
Lullaby' for him. I make up a lot of songs I don't write down, that
my family can feel and hear them, that I can make my home happy with
my music.
   ``Django's going to be a golfer. I've been telling him you can
play golf longer than any other sport. With golf and a little music,
he can have a good life.''
   At 46, Walker has long-range goals. ``I want to be a productive
artist. I want to chronicle my life as I go through it, the hell
raising and having fun when I was younger, kids and family, the
deepening of my relationship with my wife. I sing about those.
   ``I think you realize you haven't told people you love how much
you love them often enough. I imagine I'll be writing more songs
like that. I've been lucky to have this career, not really playing
by all the rules. But the game is still a good song. That keeps me
in the game.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Sea lampreys, eel-like creatures that attack
salmon and trout, are threatening the fishing industry at Lake
Champlain, the nation's sixth-largest freshwater lake. The lampreys,
which number in the tens of thousands, are finding new targets:
bass, pike, and in some cases, swimmers.</NOTE>

   Nancy Papineau still shudders at the
memory of the slimy tangle of suction-cup-filled mouths and
tooth-laden tongues in the fish tank at Dave Richard's Bait Shop.
``Absolutely gross. Horrible,'' she says.
   Richard agrees: Sea lampreys aren't a pretty sight. Nonetheless,
he's displayed them off and on for four years. With lampreys
threatening the local sport-fishing industry, Richard wants folks to
know what they look like.
   ``It's real serious,'' says Richard, who also fishes
commercially. ``I'd say if they don't control them the lake will be
dead within the next 10 years. They're getting on everything.''
   No one knows for certain how the lampreys, which are indigenous
to the ocean and have no natural predator, entered Lake Champlain.
One theory suggests that they hitched rides on boats. Regardless of
how they arrived, they've been there for over a century _ and
lately, people who rely on the lake for their livelihoods don't like
what they're seeing.
   Goose Gagnon is one of them. He quit his job in a furniture
factory last year to devote all his time to commercial fishing.
``There will be days when you come out and every fish you land has a
(lamprey) hit on them, more than one,'' says Gagnon, who's been
fishing the lake for over 30 years. ``Some I've cut open and I
refuse to eat because the meat looked bad.''
   Gagnon's not alone.
   ``I've seen fish jump that had five or six (lampreys) on 'em, and
usually they're about 8 inches long,'' says Ken Coleman, who moved
to Willsboro from Michigan three years ago. ``And they will stay
with that fish as long as possible. In most cases that one hit
doesn't kill the fish. This is why you'll see fish with scars. And
if they lose that fish they'll take another one, so they may go
through three or four fish until they reach their full size.''
   ``It's pretty severe,'' acknowledges Paul Neff, an aquatic
biologist with the New York State Bureau of Fisheries. ``Sea lamprey
activity is intense, there's a big population, in the many tens of
thousands. We should be seeing fish 8 to 15 pounds, and we just
aren't seeing them. Lake Champlain historically had a tremendous
population of Atlantic salmon, and that population went right down
the tubes. It also had a good lake trout population, and that went
right down the tubes.''
   Lampreys are blamed for much of that loss. They spawn in wetlands
and streams that feed the lake, and their larvae can live there for
three or more years. Tom Jolliff, sea lamprey unit leader for the
New York Bureau of Fisheries, says one female might spawn up to
100,000 eggs at a time. And each lamprey can live up to 17 years,
killing 40 pounds of fish during its life.
   Lampreys, which can grow longer than 20 inches, normally do their
damage in the deepest extremities of their habitat. Using their
mouths and tongues, the lampreys latch onto fish, bore holes in
their sides and literally suck the life out of the fish until they
are near death.
   These days the lampreys in Lake Champlain _ the sixth-largest
freshwater lake in the nation _ are acting more like predators than
the parasites they actually are. Their favorite targets are no
longer just salmon and lake trout.
   ``They're hitting pike and bass _ scaly, warm-water fish that
they never hit before,'' says Mike Brown, an outdoors writer who
lives on the lake. ``I caught a lot of pike last year that were 32
inches long and only weighed three pounds. They were like stick
fish.''
   ``The lamprey bothers the lake trout and the salmon, but it's
nothing compared to the job it's doing on the brown trout and the
steelheads,'' says Coleman, who dealt with a similar problem in the
Great Lakes when he worked for the Michigan game department. ``You
don't see a brown trout in here more than 2 years old.''
   Fishermen, aren't the only ones feeling the effects.

   ``Swimmers are even being hit,'' says New York Assemblyman Chris
Ortloff, whose district borders the lake. ``What that tells us is
that there are so many lamprey that they're indiscriminately
attaching themselves to whatever swims by because there simply
aren't enough trout and salmon in the lake to support them all.''
   The situation has been getting worse since the mid-1970s _ ever
since New York and Vermont began stocking hundreds of thousands of
salmon and trout every year to make the 125-mile-long lake a
sport-fishing Mecca.
   John Anderson, a Vermont fisheries manager, says one reason for
the stocking was to study the lamprey problem.
   ``Some people think we've dragged our feet,'' Anderson says.
``But if we went ahead (and treated the lake without evaluating the
situation) we'd have been hauled into the courts and we'd be there
forever.''
   Still, the study has taken nearly a decade and makes no sense to
Coleman. ``Why on earth they ever did what they did is beyond me,''
he says. ``They re-created the fishery backward. They should have
treated the lampreys first and then stocked the fish. They gave them
food so, bang, the population soared.''
   Last August, New York, Vermont and the Canadian province of
Quebec signed an agreement to work together to improve the lake. In
addition, Vermont and New York are cooperating on a plan to control
the lampreys. The New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Vermont
Department of Fish and Wildlife have assembled a 433-page draft
environmental impact statement in connection with a proposed lamprey
control program. If it works, officials estimate 500 jobs would be
created and increased sport fishing would generate $2.5 million to
$3.5 million a year.
   The plan calls for two so-called ``lampricides'' to be applied
twice, in four-year intervals, in 14 streams _ nine in New York and
five in Vermont _ and five stream-delta areas. The experiment, which
would begin next fall, would cost about $3 million.
   TFM is the main chemical that would be used. The amount applied
kills lampreys but can be metabolized by most other fish and has not
harmed water fowl, mammals or humans. It's been used extensively and
successfully in the Great Lakes and in two of New York's Finger
Lakes (Cayuga Lake and Seneca Lake) and has proven relatively
harmless. The main detriment is that some non-target organisms _
invertebrates such as worms and insects on which fish feed _ will be
killed, but not to any great extent, according to the environmental
statement.
   Bayer 73, the other chemical, is used in other countries to treat
tapeworm in humans and in this country to treat domestic animals.
   As usual, the notion of applying chemicals to the environment is
creating apprehension.
   ``My organization is very concerned about the program and its
impact,'' says Joan Mulhern, associate director of the Vermont
Public Interest Research Group, a privately funded citizen action
group. ``We've been studying the environmental impact statement and
identifying what we think are inadequacies with that report. We've
found a lot of discrepancies between the environmental impact
statement and information from the Environmental Protection Agency
about the chemicals that are going to be used. There's a lot more
information that needs to be given to the public.''
   Like VPIRG, the Lake Champlain Committee, a natural resource
advocacy group based in Burlington, Vt., hasn't taken a stand on the
matter yet, but its members are also concerned.
   ``We want to know alternatives,'' says spokeswoman Lori Fisher.
``We don't want the public money to get only channeled into a
proposal that would stimulate recreational trophy fishing.
   ``We can't lose sight of the fact that we have fish for human
consumption significantly impacted by PCBs and chlordane. There's a
rule to eat only one fish a month out of the lake. We need a
considerable amount of money to find a solution to that. We can't
lose sight of those types of problems. We want people to look at the
larger picture.''
   New Yorkers got the chance to voice their views on the matter
recently at hearings in Ticonderoga and Plattsburgh, and sentiment
favored treating the lake. Vermonters will get their turn at public
hearings next February. Officials from both states will assess the
public's reaction and decide whether to go ahead with the plan. For
it to work, both states must cooperate.

   Dabney Coleman has made a career of playing
high-powered cads. Nevertheless, he's unhappy with the way
businessmen are portrayed on TV.
   In his latest movie, NBC's ``Maybe Baby,'' set for Monday, he's a
nice guy for a change. He plays a successful middle-aged
businessman. Still, he fears his comfortable way of life will be
interrupted because his new wife (Jane Curtin) feels her biological
clock ticking and wants to have a baby.
   ``I'd like to find something on Broadway or a picture that
involves a family business situation,'' he says. ``I want to play a
successful, moral businessman. You're either a cad who's successful
or you're a nice guy who isn't successful. Jimmy Stewart was a nice
guy in `You Can't Take It With You,' but he was a failure as a
businessman. The two just don't seem to go hand in hand.''
   Coleman is best-known for his outrageous roles in such movies as
``9 to 5'' and ``Tootsie,'' and on television in ``Fernwood
2Night,'' ``Fresno,'' ``Buffalo Bill'' and ``The Slap Maxwell
Story.'' But he's also played it straight, as in ``On Golden Pond''
and the Home Box Office movie ``Murrow,'' in which he played CBS
founder William Paley.
   Coleman says his view of businessmen is influenced by his former
father-in-law, Stanton Hale, one-time chairman of Pacific Mutual
Life Insurance Co. Coleman had been married to Jane Hale.
   ``That kind of integrity you don't often see on the screen,''
says Coleman.
   Coleman hasn't yet found his role. He recently completed
production in Appleton, Wis., of ``Meet the Applegates,'' a comedy
for New World Pictures. He plays the leader of a group of highly
developed giant insects from Brazil who assume human form to save
the world from what they see as the danger of nuclear energy. His
character is called Aunt Bea.
   He is at his Brentwood home between the two roles when he talks
about ``Maybe Baby.'' An avid baseball fan, Coleman wears a cap that
says ``SA'' to shield his face from the sun on the patio. It stands
for the San Antonio Missions, one of his favorite teams.
   He grew up in Texas and on visits to his home state he
occasionally stopped in San Antonio when Ramon Martinez, now with
the Los Angeles Dodgers, was pitching for the Missions.
   Coleman says Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment,
once told him, ``I'll bet you bat to right center.''
   ``I'd played some ball in Texas,'' he says, ``and I asked him how
he knew. Brandon said, `I know that because that's the way you play
a character.' Brandon could spot it. He once aspired to be a
professional baseball player.''
   In ``Maybe Baby,'' a romantic comedy, Coleman sees his good life
jeopardized when his wife decides to put her career on hold long
enough to have a child. His character has already raised a family
and isn't interested in starting over again at his age. The movie
also stars Julia Duffy as his daughter, Florence Stanley as his
secretary and David Doyle as his poker buddy.
   ``He's successful but I don't know what business it is,'' says
Coleman. ``He's successful enough to knock off at noon for golf. It
must be nice to work about five hours a day. The story's about
whether it's too late for them to have a child. He says, `Can you
picture a 70-year-old man rooting for his kid at a Little League
game?' But to Jane it's a case of now or never.''
   Coleman says he enjoyed working once again with Jane Curtin. They
were in the 1980 movie ``How To Beat the High Co$t of Living.'' He
played her policeman boyfriend. That movie also starred Susan Saint
James, who teamed up with Curtin for the comedy series ``Kate &
Allie.''
   Immediately prior to ``Maybe Baby,'' Coleman played a lawyer in
the ABC miniseries ``Baby M.''
   He had also starred in the ABC comedy series ``The Slap Maxwell
Story,'' which was canceled due to low ratings and a disagreement
between Coleman and producer-creator Jay Tarses over how the show
should go. Slap Maxwell, a somewhat disagreeable sports writer, was
a nicer version of ``Buffalo Bill,'' an earlier series for NBC.
   ``I think where we went awry with `Slap Maxwell' was that I
thought he'd be different,'' says Coleman. ``I thought he'd be
honest, creative, a legitimate, grown-up professional, as opposed to
`Buffalo Bill.' But in the quest for comedy we had a tendency to be
like `Buffalo Bill.' Bill was a child, a self-serving, disloyal cad.
It was fun to play that. It was funnier, there's no question.
   ``I would have enjoyed `Slap' more if it had been funnier. But
I'm proud of it. It was not a lot of fun, but that's not always the
case with things you're proud of.''

   ``Hello, my name is Geoff, and I have AIDS.''
   ``Hi, I'm Tony, and I have AIDS.''
   The introductions mark the beginning of an uplifting and
unnerving theater experience called ``AIDS Alive,'' a revue
performed by men branded these days by three letters. Each is a PWA.
Person with AIDS or AIDS-related complex.
   They are all members of the PWA Theater Workshop, and ``AIDS
Alive'' is their story. They've told it in high schools,
universities, theaters, social centers, nightclubs, hospitals, just
about anywhere people will listen.
   There have been plays about AIDS before, primarily ``As Is'' and
``The Normal Heart,'' both of which had successful runs in New York
and in regional theaters. But in ``AIDS Alive,'' the performers
aren't just acting. They celebrate their own lives while facing
death.
   The workshop was born in 1987, the inspiration of an actor named
Nick Pippin and a producer named Sylvia Stein.
   ``I was diagnosed a long time ago, ages ago,'' recalls the boyish
34-year-old Pippin who has had AIDS since 1985. ``Back then, we just
left our jobs and sat around waiting to die. But I knew that if I
didn't start doing something, I was going to die.''
   He helped create the workshop and set in motion plans for ``AIDS
Alive,'' a series of loosely constructed vignettes that tell how
people with AIDS do more than just survive.
   The show grew out of taped interviews conducted with PWAs. The
conversations were fashioned into nearly an hour's worth of theater
by playwright Lanie Robertson, best-known as the author of the
Billie Holiday musical ``Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill.''
   There are short sketches and monologues. Actors don't necessarily
tell their own stories, although all the incidents in ``AIDS Alive''
are true.
   Some of the material is devastating. The stories are of the
separation of father and son, driven apart by the disease, or of
sick workers fired by their employers.
   But much of it is humorous in a black, Catch-22 sort of way. A
mother tells her son she will be serving Thanksgiving dinner on
paper plates. One man is harassed by a creditor who, when told the
customer has AIDS, snarls, ``So, you're going to take the easy way
out.''
   ``Humor was a very important thing for all of us,'' says Geoff
Edholm, a workshop member. ``We all have had very bizarre
experiences in the hospital with procedures and treatments.''
   The actors, now numbering about a dozen, are all volunteers.
Usually, there are five men in each performance.
   ``Most of us found out about the group by word-of-mouth,'' says
Edholm, one of the few workshop members who also is a professional
actor. Tom Lutz joined the group after his mother met Pippin's
mother at a support group meeting.
   ``I had no theater experience at all and volunteered with the
idea of doing stage managing _ or being wardrobe mistress,'' Lutz
laughs.
   Audience reaction changes during the course of an evening,
beginning with silence, then smiles, laughter, even a few tears and
then cheers.
   ``In the very beginning, they don't know they can laugh,'' Edholm
says. ``AIDS is not supposed to be funny. But in a few minutes, they
get the idea that we're having fun, and we're laughing.''
   For most of the company, appearing in ``AIDS Alive,'' is their
only steady job, and they don't get paid _ just a $50-a-month
stipend from the workshop. Many had to leave their full-time jobs
because they were too ill to work or because they couldn't qualify
for Medicaid if they made too much money.
   ``And our medications are very expensive,'' says workshop member
Nico Angelo. ``Most of us are averaging some $3,000 a month in
bills.''
   ``AIDS Alive'' originally was written for nine performers, but
the roles were reduced to five.
   ``We'd like to increase that to six or seven permanent roles with
two or three understudies,'' says Carter Inskeep who directed the
show. ``We are trying to find people to be backups, swing people, to
learn several different roles in case someone gets sick.''
   ``It's still very difficult to get people involved,'' Pippin
says. ``There's that element of disclosure about AIDS. It's still a
big issue for some people.''
   One of the newer members of the troupe is Buddy Smith, who joined
the show when another performer got sick. Smith was given a new role
with new lines and wasn't simply an understudy for the absent actor.
   ``It's a living theater piece,'' Pippin says. ``It will never
remain the same. As people are added or leave the group, the show
changes.''
   Now Pippin and Inskeep would like to expand the circle of
performers, adding women and drug users who have contracted AIDS,
but it has been hard to recruit members outside the gay community.
   Those in the troupe say their hard work and difficult decision to
go public with their disease has been worth it.
   ``I can only guess how awful things would have been for me
without this show,'' says Tony Torres. ``So many things that happen
to each one of us individually now can happen to somebody else
tomorrow. I have learned so much about what will happen to me later
on, so that it will easier for me to cope with it when it does
happen.
   ``The show gets me through,'' he adds. ``Before we opened, I was
supposed to be in the hospital. But I said, `No, I've got a show to
do.'''

<HEAD>Economic Revolution Brings Change in Mood of Chinese People</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Surging China, b0694</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NINGBO, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's decade-old economic revolution has
brought sharp changes in people's ambitions, lifestyles and social
mores.
   Whether in rapidly modernizing coastal cities such as Ningbo with
its hotels, discos and high-rise apartments, or in nearby towns
where peasants still thresh grain by hand, Chinese are saying the
changes in their lives go far deeper than mere gains in income.
   The surge in economic activity has brought new opportunities, new
risks and new rivalries as some people get rich faster than others.
   One who epitomizes the new Chinese dream of success is Xu Kaya.
   A former peasant and assembly line worker, he presides over one
of the largest private companies in Cixi, a rural town outside
Ningbo. His television parts factory will turn out 3 million yuan
($804,000) worth of goods this year, and he is a partner in a new
chemical fibre factory being built.
   He has a Toshiba color television set, a Nissan sedan and a maid.
   Ten years ago, Xu was planting rice on a commune, his dreams of
studying medicine thwarted by the shutdown of universities by Mao
Tse-tung's 1966-76 leftist Cultural Revolution.
   ``I learned to overcome difficulties and developed a strong
desire to get ahead,'' he said.
   Now 33, he spends 12 to 13 hours a days at his factory. He has no
time to think about joining the Communist Party, once necessary for
success in China.
   ``I rely on my own ability,'' he said.
   Nor does he fear political change.
   ``If they call me a capitalist, they'd have to call 70 percent of
the population capitalists.''
   Jiang Yuenan, a young Cixi government worker, agreed. Local
farmers, he said, are always on the lookout for a profitable venture
and most have more than one source of income.
   Some rent trucks to haul their produce 55 miles to Ningbo, a city
of 1 million people, for the best prices, or to act as middlemen in
business deals, or buy up raw materials in one town to sell for
profit in another.
   Such activities were politically suspect 10 years ago, but they
are now part of daily life in rural China.
   City dwellers are not far behind.
   Zhang Hangtie, a barber, is one of 60,000 Ningbo residents who
have opened private businesses in the past decade, and he revels in
it both for the profits and the independence.
   ``I am my own boss,'' he said as he blow-dried a customer's hair
in his tiny shop in the front room of a traditional two-story wood
row house. ``I wanted to get rich and now I can.''
   But not all Chinese are able to that. Income differentials have
widened sharply, creating new social tensions rooted in jealousy.
   A Beijing newspaper reported the case of a woman factory worker
who beat up a private tradesman on the street because she was
angered by his flamboyant lifestyle. Private factory owners in
several cities have been attacked and even killed by workers who
accused them of exploitation for giving themselves higher salaries.
   The World Economic Herald of teeming Shanghai, which is 125 miles
north of Ningbo, said recently that many people's expectations have
far exceeded what is possible, and ``the general sense of
frustration is threatening to snowball.''
   Some older Chinese say the new opportunities came too late for
them, while they and others are reluctant to plunge into market
competition and risk losing the guarantees of a state-run economy:
lifetime employment, free medical care and subsidized food and
housing.
   Yu Jin, a 26-year-old city-employed translator, said he'd thought
about setting up a private translation service for foreign visitors
to Ningbo, but feared giving up his secure government job.
   One large group left behind in the reforms are intellectuals, who
survived decades of political suspicion in the Mao years and now
find themselves surpassed in income by Zhang the barber and factory
workers.
   Chen Lianjun, the 41-year-old vice principal of the Ningbo high
school, said she earns 180 yuan ($48) a month, including subsidies
for food and books; Zhang earns 800 yuan ($214) a month. ``It seems
unfair,'' she said.
   ``Money isn't important,'' said her husband, Wang Wenhe, also 41
years old. ``What counts are traditional values such as family and
friends.''
   ``The young people's thinking isn't like ours,'' his wife said.
``They don't like to suffer. They want higher salaries, and when
they have vacations they want to travel. It's a new trend.''

<HEAD>Bea Arthur and Richard Kiley in Second-Chance Romance</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beatrice Arthur is pleased to play an
old-fashioned love story with Richard Kiley, although her view of it
is anything but sentimental.
   ``It's like a geriatric Doris Day and Rock Hudson romance,'' she
says of the ABC movie ``First Love.''
   She plays a widow who, a suitable time after the death of her
husband, pulls out some yellowing letters she's saved for years and
gets in touch with her high school sweetheart. To her astonishment,
their old romance is rekindled.
   ``It's a very sweet love story,'' said Arthur. ``We don't get
into any of the problems of the world. People say, `Oh, it's never
been done before, older people having a romance.'''
   Actually, it has been done before. Katharine Hepburn made several
romantic movies at an age when most actresses are playing mothers or
grandmothers.
   ``Over the weekend I was watching some Doris Day and Rock Hudson
movie,'' Arthur said. ``I said, `That's what we did.'''
   The movie will air this Sunday on ABC. Besides Arthur and Kiley,
it stars Joan Van Ark and Anne Francis. It was filmed here and in
New York.
   ``When they first sent me the script for the movie I said it's
too simple,'' she recalled. ``It's too simplistic. Gil Cates said,
`That's its charm. No one has acne, no one sweats.' He called it a
fable. It's a fairy tale. It was such a pleasure to do.
   ``People keep telling me they're surprised to see me do this kind
of a role. I guess it's because I wasn't the stern Maude or Dorothy.
It's refreshing to read a script like this. So much of what you see
is junk.''
   Arthur, who describes herself as one of the few actresses who
doesn't dye her gray hair, stars as Dorothy in the NBC comedy hit
``Golden Girls.'' She previously starred in ``Maude.''
   At the time ``First Love'' airs, she will have just returned from
London, where she and ``Golden Girls'' co-stars Betty White, Rue
McClanahan and Estelle Getty were invited to put on a special show
for a royal command performance.
   Arthur was a Tony award-winning Broadway star, occasional feature
film performer and a regular hand in George Gobel and Sid Caesar TV
variety shows before Norman Lear brought her west to star as
``Maude'' in 1972.
   ``People always judge you by what you did last,'' she said.
``Dudley Moore said to me, `I didn't know you sang.' He didn't know
me when I was in the musical theater on Broadway. In drama school I
did classical roles, but it was hard to do classical roles on
Broadway.
   ``I got a job singing in a nightclub. I took myself very
seriously. Everyone was trying to sound like Lena Horne. Julius Monk
was running the nightclub, and he said, `You're so tall and
imposing, no one's going to take you seriously if you sing that your
man's left you and you're going to throw yourself into the river.'''
   She never did comedy until ``Three Penny Opera.''
   ``I was hired as a singer,'' she said. ``The audience laughed at
one song. I was emoting, and I couldn't believe it was funny. Then I
started to relax and after that comedy came easy for me.''
   She was first discovered by Lear in an off-Broadway revue in
1954. Five years later when Lear was doing a variety show with
Gobel, he invited her to become a regular. ``I couldn't get arrested
in New York, so I came out here and did it for a while,'' she said.
She was also a regular on ``Caesar's Hour.''
   She won her Tony for her role as Vera Charles in ``Mame.'' Angela
Lansbury won a Tony for the title role. Arthur was in the movie
version of ``Mame,'' and in ``That Kind of Woman'' and ``Lovers and
Others Strangers.''
   Later, when Lear was doing ``All in the Family'' he invited her
to do a guest role. She played Maude Findlay, Archie Bunker's
liberal cousin. CBS took one look at it and signed her up for her
own series. ``They said, `Who is that girl?' By then I'd been around
for 50 years.''
   ``First Love'' is the first time Arthur has worked with Kiley,
who starred in NBC's ``A Year in the Life.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``The Good Mother,'' ``Child's Play''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   ``The Good Mother''
   
   Female film stars in mid-career usually turn away from romantic
roles to portray mothers. A good example is Joan Crawford in her
Academy Award-winning ``Mildred Pierce.'' The lone exception is
Katharine Hepburn; it's hard to imagine her mothering a gaggle of
squalling kids.
   Diane Keaton began her transition as the career woman who
inherited an infant in the successful ``Baby Boom.'' Now she turns
dramatic in ``The Good Mother'' as a divorced mother caught in a
custody battle with her former husband.
   Based on the best-selling novel by Sue Miller and written by
Michael Bortman, the film describes the life and background of the
single mother, who lives on returns from a humdrum laboratory job
and the grudging child support payments of her ex, played by James
Naughton. Flashbacks disclose the reason for her repressed
sexuality; her family had been dominated by an unfeeling,
dictatorial father (Ralph Bellamy).
   Keaton meets Liam Neeson, an attractive, free-living artist who
releases her inhibitions with unbridled sex. The idyll is destroyed
when Naughton appears to claim his 6-year-old daughter. In the
custody suit he accuses the couple of having intercourse in the same
bed where the girl was sleeping.
   Also, because Keaton sought sexual openness for her daughter,
Neeson allowed the girl to satisfy her curiosity by touching his
penis when she saw him stepping out of the shower. (This incident is
not portrayed in the film).
   Keaton is represented in court by Jason Robards, who warns that
her case is perilous. The trial is heart-wrenching, and the result
should not be disclosed in a review.
   Leonard Nimoy directed ``The Good Mother'' in an astounding
change of pace from his last, ``Three Men and a Baby.'' There is no
humor in the new film, and some patrons may be turned off by its
seriousness.
   The filmmakers deserve credit for attempting a drama of complex
social issues: the role of the single mother; the question of how
far sexual frankness should go. But the issues become clouded, and
the outcome lacks the emotional impact of ``Kramer vs. Kramer.''
   Keaton is adept at portraying the mother's anguish, employing few
of her nervous mannerisms. The Irish actor Liam Neeson demonstrates
his star potential in an ambiguous role, and Teresa Wright offers
welcome humanity as Keaton's mother.
   Arnold Glimcher produced the Touchstone film, which is rated R
because of language, sex scenes and adult subject matter. Running
time: 103 minutes.

   ``Child's Play''
   
   Weaving children into tales of terror and the supernatural
usually elevates the scare factor a decimal or two. Would we have
been as horrified if Linda had been a 30-year-old instead of a
school girl in ``The Exorcist''? And Damien in ``The Omen'' sends
more shivers up spines as a little boy than he does as a grownup.
   In ``Child's Play,'' a 6-year-old takes on an evil doll.
   Andy Barclay is a lonely lad until Chucky comes into his life.
Chucky is all the rage, he's a Good Guy Doll and every little boy
has one. Chucky is just as cute as a button with his shock of red
hair, coveralls, sneakers and wide innocent smile.
   Chucky also is a malevolent mound of plastic whose soul is pure
evil.
   It is the soul of a sadistic murderer who learns enough of a
voodoo ritual to zap out of his body as it lay dying in a toy store
and into the doll's so he can live forever and settle a few scores.
   ``Child's Play'' is more than just an odyssey of revenge; it is a
chiller that will make you think twice about cuddling those ugly
little Cabbage Patch kids or visiting Barbie's townhouse.
   Tom Holland (``Fright Night''), who also wrote the screenplay
with Don Mancini and John Lafia, plunges into the story with a
fast-break shootout in Chicago between the psychotic Charles Lee Ray
(Brad Dourif) and police. Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon)
follows him into a toy store and slaughters Ray with a hail of
bullets. Ray, though, has one more trump card up his bloodied sleeve.
   Cut to the Barclay home. Andy (Alex Vincent) is making breakfast
(and a major mess) for his mom while he watches a Good Guys
commercial on television. It's his way of buttering her up so he can
get a doll for his birthday. But mom, a struggling clerk in a
department store, just can't afford it. Later that day, her friend,
Maggie, takes her to a street peddler who's selling one for a
fraction of the actual price. It is, of course, the doll Ray
clutched as he died.
   Like most children in horror movies Andy perceives evil long
before the grownups do, and knows that his life must depend on his
own wits.
   Holland slowly develops the horror and first unleashes it when
Maggie (Dinah Manoff) baby-sits for Andy. After ordering Andy to bed
and turning off the late night news, she's surprised to suddenly
hear the TV and see Chucky sitting in a chair before the set.
   It's not quite the heartstopper the next few scenes turn out to
be. With her back to the hall, Maggie hears tiny footsteps rushing
by. She thinks it's Andy. Silly woman. And like all baby-sitters in
these flicks, she's the first to go: Chucky hammers in her head and
she crashes through the sixth-floor window to the street below.
   Andy tells his mother, Karen (Catherine Hicks), that Chucky told
him Maggie deserved to die. She makes Chucky talk, but he only says
the programmed words the manufacturer put in. Then Karen discovers
the batteries still in the doll's packing case! She sneaks a look at
Chucky's empty battery case, and with a turn almost as frightening
as Blair's head swirl in ``The Exorcist,'' Chucky snarls at Karen
with a demonic sneer and tells her exactly what he thinks of her.
   The terror's afoot, climaxing in a scene that makes the Cuisinart
bit in the ``Gremlins'' look like a picnic with Mary Poppins.
   Holland reteams with Sarandon, who starred as the vampire in
``Night Fright.'' Sarandon's so-called tough urban accent is forced
and a distraction from the action. Alex Vincent is adorable in his
film debut, with his deep voice. But the real star is Chucky, who's
far more interesting than his human counterparts. Kevin Yagher
designed and supervised the operation of the killer doll.
   ``Child's Play'' will not go down in horror movie history, but it
certainly has its moments.
   The David Kirschner production for United Artists Pictures is
rated R.

   Videos reviewed this week: ``Shakedown,'' ``The Moderns,''
``Sleepaway Camp II.''

<TEXT>
   ``Shakedown'' (MCA Home Entertainment; VHS-Beta, $89.95; Rated R).
   
   Trashing New York City's sleazy 42nd Street strip in a stupid
chase scene is the emotional center of ``Shakedown,'' a violent,
improbable crime thriller that lasted five minutes in theaters and
went immediately to videocassette.
   It stars Peter Weller and Sam Elliott, two talented and
disciplined actors who must be thoroughly embarrassed by their
involvement in this witless film, but struggle vainly to breathe
some humanity into two-dimensional roles.
   The name of the screenwriter-director is being withheld to
protect his career. Well, all right. It's James Glickenhaus. That's
G_L_I_C_K_E_N_H_A_U_S.
   This ugly little movie plays like a sadistic Looney Tune, with
3.5 crazy chase scenes, a half-dozen explosions, psychotic,
cartoonish behavior by practically everyone, pointless vulgarity and
mayhem.
   Elliott is the cop pal of Weller, a lawyer about to marry and
work for his fiancee's Daddy on Wall Street. His last case as a
public defender is a self-defense plea for a crack dealer who's
killed a crooked cop in a drug deal.
   Of course, the lawyer's Old Flame is prosecuting the case and
they hop into bed without a thought for the personal or legal ethics
of the situation. As the crooked cops close in on Our Heros, there
is much bashing and chasing and shooting and blowing up of things.
   If that's what you're looking for, this movie has it.

   ``The Moderns'' (Nelson Entertainment; VHS-Beta, $89.98; Rated R)
   
   Why would a woman take a bath lathered in tiers of pearls? It's
certainly not the best way to get the neck clean.
   Probably because Linda Fiorentino already had read this silly
script and expected to be surprised by a nude Keith Carradine who
moments before was downstairs trying to sell a painting to her
art-collector husband, Bertram Stone. Isn't it every woman's fantasy
to make love on the bathroom floor wearing pearls and patches of
soap bubbles?
   Carradine's character is called Nick Hart, giving us Hart vs.
Stone. So don't ask who will end up with lovely, bathing-beauty
Rachel.
   The raging husband (John Lone), is abusive to Rachel, kicks Hart
in the face in a boxing ring after challenging him to a duel and
burns Modiglianis in the fireplace. After first, of course, cutting
one of the model's breasts from the canvas because a critic said its
nipple looked like a wart.
   Why does Rachel stay with Stone? Money. Hart, a starving painter,
lives in a garret and even forges masters to survive. He couldn't
possibly buy the pouting, languid Rachel enough pearls in which to
bathe.
   Besides, this is Bohemian Paris of the 1920s, and writer-director
Alan Rudolph presents these characters on the cutting edge of a new
artistic era as single-dimensional saps and lunatics.
   He and co-writer Jon Bradshaw may have meant well, but the
archness and self-conscious pretension with which they translate
avant-garde to the screen sets one's teeth on edge. It's difficult
to decide if they're insulting their audience or displaying their
own intellectual shallowness. Probably both. The constant lapsing
into French with sporadic subtitles is difficult to deal with,
especially on the small screen. The literary references are obscure
enough that if you don't know them, you won't know what you're not
missing. But when you do catch one, it's generally embarrassingly
gee-whiz.
   ``The Moderns'' is a no-win endeavor: There's no enlightenment,
nor any loving treatment of artistic eccentrics.
   Minor characters, including several drawn from real life, float
through as proof that this was Paris and that it was bizarre.
Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas are spotted at their salon;
Ernest Hemingway is stupidly drunk in every bar.
   Genevieve Bujold and Geraldine Chaplin give credibility to
peripheral but stock roles. Wallace Shawn plays Oiseau, a gossip
columnist who dresses up like a dumpy middle-aged woman so he can go
unobserved to his own funeral, where a graveside priest eulogizes
him as having ``converted gossip into poetry.''
   Oiseau gets off most of the goofier lines, including telling Hart
at the railroad station: ``I just ran into Maurice Ravel in the
men's room, but he didn't recognize me.'' Who would, in those high
heels and cloche hat?
   Oiseau sashays past Kevin J. O'Connor, playing the besotted
Hemingway, who is mumbling lines that conclude with ``Paris is a
portable banquet.''
   ``You should work on that,'' quips Oiseau with the hindsight we
all have that it utimately will read ``Moveable Feast.''
   As he and Hart head back to the United States, Oiseau says he's
glad to be leaving Paris because ``the imitators are imitiating the
imitators. Hollywood will be like a breath of fresh air.''
   Amen. The city depicted here is not only stagnant, but
bush-league.

   ``Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers'' (Nelson Entertainment;
VHS-Beta, $79.98; Rated PG)
   
   Dear Mommy and Daddy: Here I am at Camp Rolling Rock. Angela, our
new counselor, is real neat. She plays a great guitar and sings real
good, and loves to take us on nature hikes. Last night, one of the
kids, Phoebe, told us about a 14-year-old boy who everybody picked
on. Well, he killed a bunch of people six years ago at Camp Arawak.
Angela got real mad at Phoebe for telling that story and took her
back to the cabin. But we never saw Phoebe again. Angela told us the
next day that she had to send her home. There are these other two
girls who like to smoke cigarettes and stay up late with boys.
Angela got real mad at them, too, and had to send them home. Angela
gets mad at a lot of people and they disappear. I don't think I like
Camp Rolling Rock too much. I am not a happy camper. But please
don't let Angela send me home ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   And dear viewer, whatever you do, avoid ``Sleepaway Camp II.''
This ``Friday the 13th'' ripoff stars Pamela Springsteen (``Fast
Times at Ridgemont High'') as the killer counselor who dispatches
campers faster than you can rev up your chainsaw. She slices and
dices all over the place and does in one little darling by stuffing
her down the outhouse comode.
   You can pretty much figure out who Angela is. The why is slightly
more elusive, as it normally is in these movies.
   The fright level in this Michael A. Simpson film, which was
written by Fritz Gordon, is not very high. You won't bite your
fingernails but you might kick yourself for staying with this movie
for longer than 10 minutes.

   ``Messiah'' is the most malleable of masterpieces, and each
season seems to bring a new interpretation.
   This year's version, conducted by Trevor Pinnock, comes from the
ancient intsruments crowd. It is completely different from last
year's ``Messiah,'' a jubilant rendition with a massive choir and
roaring pipe organ conducted by Andrew Davis.
   Both are outstanding additions to a field already crowded with
commendable recordings of George Frideric Handel's most famous music.
   Pinnock approaches ``Messiah'' more as a meditation than as a
celebration. The many virtues of this recording reach a peak of
sublimity in ``He shall feed his flock,'' sung by Anne Sofie von
Otter and Arleen Auger. At six minutes, this version is a full
minute longer than in most recordings _ a daring choice that could
fall absolutely flat unless done with the greatest taste and
refinement.
   The chorus and orchestra are superb, and Pinnock's version should
have broad appeal far beyond early-music enthusiasts.
   Davis' recording, released a year ago, cheerfully swam against
the baroque tide with a big orchestra, a huge chorus and a pipe
organ thrown in for good measure. This is ``Messiah'' as the
Victorians loved it, the sort of choral extravaganza that has only
recently been overthrown by the ``authentic'' approach.
   Davis appears to have settled every interpretive choice in favor
of the option that will make the listener's socks roll up and down
with excitement. Kathleen Battle, for instance, embellishes
``Rejoice, rejoice greatly'' with dozens of thrilling notes from the
top of her range. The pipe organ joining the frenzy in the
``Hallelujah'' chorus is like heaping whipped cream on mince pie _
sinfully rich.
   Sir Georg Solti's version, recorded in 1984, is also big but not
invariably loud. He used just 40 instruments from the Chicago
Symphony, plus a chorus of 100. Kiri te Kanawa, who doesn't attempt
some of Battle's vocal fireworks but has the richer, riper voice, is
an asset of this version.
   Solti appears determined to put his distinctive mark on
``Messiah,'' notably by forcing the chorus to hush in some odd
places. In ``For unto us a child is born,'' for instance, why make a
sharp decrescendo on ``prince of peace''?
   Christopher Hogwood went further out on the early-music limb with
his ``Messiah,'' recorded in 1980. The brightness of the strings,
plus the sharp-edged sound of the boy trebles of the Christ Church
Cathedral Choir from Oxford, may grate on some listeners.
   The Hogwood version may have the strongest cast of soloists,
including sopranos Judith Nelson and Emma Kirkby and bass David
Thomas. However, Thomas' decision to sing ``in-corr-up-TEE-ble''
instead of the normal pronunciation of ``incorruptible'' in ``A
Trumpet Shall Sound'' is a minor annoyance.
   (The Hogwood version is also available as a videotape, recorded
at several locations in Westminster Abbey.)
   John Eliot Gardiner's ``Messiah,'' in 1982, is similar to
Pinnock's version in spirit and instrumentation. Gardiner is
reticicent even in the ``Hallelujah'' chorus, which Pinnock takes
with customary gusto.
   The early music style of ``Messiah'' is now more than 20 years
old, dating to 1966 in this country with Robert Shaw's RCA recording
with chorus and orchestra of about 30 each. Tha 1966 version, a
breaktrhough in its time, stands up very well today.
   Indeed, it sounds very much like Shaw's 1984 recording for Telarc
with the Atlanta Symphony Orchstra and Chamber Chorus. For this
version Shaw used 29 instrumentalists but doubled the chorus, to 60.
Such are the developments in performance in the past 20 years that
the Shaw version now sounds resolutely middle-of-the-road.
   A note on price: Pinnock, Davis, Shaw and Solti fit ``Messiah''
into two compact discs, while Gardiner and Hogwood take three. The
third disc adds at least $14 to the purchase price.

<TEXT>
   How does a young actor deal with suddenly
being named an international star and ``the sexiest man alive''?
   ``You deal with it by a trick of the mind,'' said Mel Gibson.
``You figure: Is it worrying me that much? Does anybody else give a
damn as much as I do? So you decide not to. It's easy.''
   The Gibson method appears to be working. He seems totally
unchanged from the time he first arrived here seven years ago after
appearing as Mad Max in the Australian movie, ``The Road Warrior.''
He still displays a hint of shyness, contrasting with the
self-assured roles he has played on the screen.
   The actor was here for a publicity binge for his latest Warner
Bros. film, ``Tequila Sunrise,'' co-starring Kurt Russell, Michelle
Pfeiffer and Raul Julia. Gibson's last role cast him as a Los
Angeles cop in ``Lethal Weapon.'' The new movie puts him back in Los
Angeles but on the other side of the law.
   ``Things don't quite match up, and that's what appealed to me
about the script,'' said Gibson. ``Here's a man who has a very
illicit lifestyle and has had an unsavory career. Yet he always
tells the truth and deals honorably with people. That makes an
interesting combination.
   ``The script doesn't deal with good and bad but shades of gray
in-between. He's retired (from drug-dealing). But nobody wants him
to retire.''
   In ``Tequila Sunrise,'' Gibson is at odds with his high school
buddy, Russell, who is a narcotics cop. Pfeiffer is the beauty
caught between them. The writer is Robert Towne, best known for
writing ``Chinatown''; he also directed ``Tequila.''
   ``The script just lobbed into my mailbox one day,'' said Gibson.
``It was one of those scripts that you just kept turning the pages;
you didn't know why. It demanded a second read. I liked it.
   ``Towne knows the meaning of the word `economy.' He can write
scenes that say a lot but don't have any words. In the script
there's a book of matches and an ash tray that say a lot. No words
needed.''
   Gibson sounds totally American in the movie. However, in
conversation, the Australian creeps in. That's only natural for a
fellow who spent his first 12 years in Peekskill and Mount Vernon,
N.Y., and the rest of his boyhood in Sydney. His mother was
Australian, his father an American who decided to emigrate with his
10 children so the older sons would not be drafted during the
Vietnam War.
   Taunted because of his Yankee accent, Gibson's ruggedness allowed
him to integrate. He was going to be a chef or a journalist until
his sister submitted him for a drama institute at the University of
New South Wales. He appeared in stage plays and a cheapie flick,
``Summer City,'' that attracted the eye of director George Miller.
The result was the star-making ``Road Warrior.''
   Gibson filmed two sequels and also co-starred in the acclaimed
World War I film, ``Gallipoli,'' and Peter Weir's ``The Year of
Living Dangerously.'' His American-made movies have been less
successful: ``The Bounty,'' ``The River,'' ``Mrs. Soffel.'' Only
``Lethal Weapon'' has lighted up the box office.
   He still makes his home in Australia, and his wife, Robyn, and
their four young children usually travel with him.
   ``I think travel is good for young kids,'' he said. ``It's a good
education for them, as good as they'll get sitting in one place.
They're still little Aussies, but I think they benefit from being
exposed to different cultural elements, attitudes and expressions.
They still speak Australian, though they get into a Southern
California twang when they're here. But I beat it out of them.''
   Why not live here, where the work is, rather than Australia?
   ``Well, I don't have to live here. (Australia) is where I want to
live, it's where the family is comfortable. And that's where I'm
comfortable,'' he said.
   Gibson was part of the Australian film boom, about which he
observed:
   ``I think it's tapered a bit. They don't seem to have the same
flowering industry they had in the late '70s and the beginning of
this decade. I'm sure there's a potential there. They've just
started up a new film bank that has been around for a while but
unfortunately it didn't have any money. Maybe when it gets cashed up
they can make some good product.''

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indiana Jones and his swashbuckling treasure
hunts would have been at home in Egypt in the early 1800s, when a
mix of travelers and adventurers became _ by chance _ the world's
first Egyptologists.
   The calling still retained a lot of Harrison Ford's movie
character in 1922 when Howard Carter, an eccentric Briton, dug into
the most famous tomb of all, the gold-packed burial place of Pharaoh
Tutankhamon.
   But as Egyptology prepares to enter the 21st century, the country
that gave the science its name is asking modern lovers of its
ancient past to give up the shovel and trowel. Don't dig and
destroy, Egyptian antiquities officials are saying, but restore and
rebuild.
   ``Our grandfathers, the ancient Egyptians, were reaching for
eternity,'' the acting chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities
Organization, M.A. Nur-el-din, told the fifth annual International
Congress of Egyptology. ``It's our task to let them remain eternal.
It's time we looked on the ancient Egyptians as subjects, not just
objects.''
   To thousands of years of wayfarers, Egypt's monuments have seemed
immortal, a rich and glorious past paraded in stone monoliths and on
tomb walls. Evidence is growing, however, that the immortality was
fleeting: Time is running out.
   ``New artifacts keep coming up at new digs ... (but) where are we
going?'' said Egyptology professor Faiza Haikal. ``We must leave the
artifacts safely buried in the ground (and) restore and preserve
what has been unearthed.
   ``The once slow process of deterioration is accelerating. We have
the usual problems of environment and a rising water table, but now
the monuments face the spread of settlements, with sewage and other
risks.''
   Most scholars are aware of, and strongly support, the changing
face of Egyptology, its shift from seeking treasure to seeking
knowledge. Many of today's Egyptologists spend their days before
delicately painted walls or engraved columns, copying pictures and
writings that are disappearing at a frightening rate.
   Others dig, but in remote sites or at the edges of villages whose
high birth rates demand the use of all available land, whether or
not history lies beneath it.
   Unlike the tomb of the boy pharoah Tutankhamun, discovered almost
in tact and containing hordes of treasure beyond belief, many sites
in Egypt contain only fragments only _ pottery pieces rich enough
for the scholar but perhaps not substantial enough to raise funds
for the ever increasing price of mounting expeditions.
   Hundreds of subjects tantalize modern Egyptologists, ranging from
pyramid research and the Sphinx, to the secret language of the
baboons, Egypt in the Old Testament, magic in ancient Egypt, adverbs
and adverb clauses, the position of Tutankhamun's feathered corselet
against iconographical sources, the role of the handicapped people
in ancient Egypt, the transition from tribe to state and some
aspects of the use of honey in ancient Egypt.
   The profession has come a long way from the image of the solitary
Egyptologist trotting over desert sands on his faithful donkey,
wind-blasted and poor, trying to fight off eternity-starved mummies
and antiquities smugglers with baskets of tana leaves.
   Gamal Mokhtar, director for the international effort to save the
monuments of Nubia during the 1960s, has witnessed many of the
changes, including the passing of Egypt's heritage from foreign to
local hands and items of national heritage required to be kept in
Egypt.
   ``Egyptology as a science began after different evils,'' he said.
``You had monumental neglect of the monuments from the days of the
pharoahs. Then you had Christians and the monuments on religious
grounds.
   ``Then you had ... Napoleon Bonaparte bringing with him in his
attempt to conquer Egypt hundreds of artists and scientists, who
awakened the eyes of the world to the glories that still could be
found in Egypt.''
   Hundreds came either to study or steal, he said. Then, in 1799,
the Rosetta Stone _ with its ancient Greek and Egyptian inscriptions
_ was found, providing a key to deciphering the hidden meaning of
ancient Egyptian writing (hieroglyphics).
   Mokhtar has also witnessed high technology replacing hands in an
attempt to locate hidden artifacts. Satellite photos provide what
years of walking might never show. In some large sites, instruments
replace the questioning mind, showing just the spot where buried
history can be found, though seldom indicating exactly what lies
below.
   But for most Egyptologists dirt-under-the fingernails is still
where it's at.
   ``You know what things are by touching them,'' said archaeologist
and Egyptologist Michael Jones. ``You won't know what glass is
except when you feel it, though high technology has its place.
   For the past five years Jones and his wife, Egyptologist Angelea
Milward, have searched for clues to one of the most important
religious relics in ancient Egypt, the Apis bull, on a site
surrounded by a village some 45 minutes south of Cairo.
   Though they were not searching for treasure and have found
nothing of great value, they are content that they have added facts
missing from the pages of ancient Egypt.
   ``Up until the 19th century, much of ancient Egypt was frozen in
time,'' Jones said. ``Because there was wealth still buried in
Egypt, people came looking for goodies and found them. It's a great
tragedy, because lay people nowadays are mesmerized, knocked over
backwards by Tutankhamun and the famous statues.''
   For today's Egyptologist working in the field, the goal is to
band together the facts in order to reveal a three dimensional side
to what has been found.
   ``But it's difficult,'' Jones said, ``because many of the
artifacts have been taken from their home. We have parts of
monuments, other parts remaining in museums and elsewhere out of
Egypt. Physical remains are often seen in isolation.
   ``Imagine someone 3,000 years from now trying to recreate our
world?''
   Jones said there are few shortcuts in his profession. He walks
and walks his site, then walks it again, trying to turn back the
clock.
   ``You get to know your site the way you know your house,'' he
said.
   ``What's happening in Egyptology is the ancient Egyptians are no
longer the curiosities they once were. You can meet them via
archaeology and not in the fancified terms Egyptologists used in the
old days.
   ``You try to understand them in their own environment. You're not
just digging up artifacts; you're digging up people.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Bangles Put ``Everything'' Into New Album</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bangle Susanna Hoff's mom invoked the dreaded
``M-word'' when her daughter recently played her group's latest
album, ``Everything,'' for her.
   ``She thought it as more sophisticated and MATURE,'' than the
band's first two records, Hoffs said.
   Maturity may be a dirty word for many rockers _ and Hoffs quickly
disavowed her mother's language _ but it's an apt description for
both the record's sound and the approach the Bangles took in
recording their first album in almost three years.
   After two LPs and seemingly endless rounds of touring, the
Bangles say they finally feel comfortable with their craft.
   ``We're learning to trust ourselves more, to be more emotional in
our performance,'' said bass player Michael Steele. ``I don't really
know if you can call it maturity. It's more of an artistic growth.''
   The four women of the Bangles, who pay homage to classic bands of
the 1960s with their sunny melodies and intricate harmonies, became
stars with such hits as ``Walk Like an Egyptian,'' and the Prince
tune, ``Manic Monday,'' from the 1986 LP, ``Different Light.''
   The Bangles are thankful for their success, but said they needed
to take greater control over their music.
   Producer David Kahne, whose relationship with the band was stormy
at best, was replaced by Davitt Sigerson. Hoffs, Steele and sisters
Vicki and Debbi Peterson, who once readily accepted contributions
from outside songwriters, each wrote or co-wrote all of the new
album's 13 songs.
   When all four members of a band write songs, they notice when
their biggest hits are written by someone else. ``Walk Like an
Egyptian'' was written by Liam Sternberg, ``If She Knew What She
Wants'' is a Jules Shear song and the Bangles hit the Top 10 with a
cover of Paul Simon's ``Hazy Shade of Winter.''
   ``It was a reaction to the success of `Different Light' that made
us determined to write as many songs as we could come up with _
strong stuff that we could feel was emotionally attached to us,''
Steele said. ``We had a strange, slight feeling of distance from
`Different Light.'''
   The flip side to trusting your own instincts, of course, is
getting burned if the public rejects you. Some critics have grumbled
that ``Everything'' sounds overproduced and the songs don't sparkle.
But the public's responding to the first single, a Hoffs rocker
called ``In Your Room,'' which is moving swiftly up the charts.
   The Bangles say they liked the songs they wrote for this album so
much they couldn't bear to throw any away. Hoffs said it costs the
band money to pack the record with 13 songs instead of the
traditional 10.
   ``The thought of not having those extra three tracks on the
record just to save money makes no sense to me,'' Hoffs said. ``I'd
rather put out a record that we truly love.''
   ``That's why we got into it in the first place,'' Steele said.
``We're really oriented toward the music.''
   ``I got into it because of the fashion,'' Hoffs said, lampooning
her colleague's cliche.
   ``I do it for the boys,'' Steele shot back.
   They may joke about it, but the Bangles say they're tired of
defending themselves against people who denigrate their musical
ability because they're women.
   The Bangles knew Sigerson, who's produced Rickie Lee Jones and
David & David, through mutual friends.
   ``We liked Davitt immediately,'' Hoffs said. ``He's been a
songwriter and he's from that orientation. We felt more comfortable
with someone we could talk to about our songs.''
   Those songs are generally the typical pop music fare of love won
and lost, with a few twists and turns. In ``Glitter Years,'' Steele
reminisces about the mid-'70s California rock scene and laments some
of its drug casualties. In the ballad ``Eternal Flame,'' Hoffs said
she used Roy Orbison and Patsy Cline as role models.
   ``We just sort of let each song lead us down whatever path it
would lead us, like putting on a blindfold and just going,'' Hoff
said. ``There's no formula. I wish sometimes there was. Everytime I
write something I rewrite it a billion times.''
   Hoffs said the Bangles feel grateful to get their songs on the
radio, since the singles charts are dominated by young heavy metal
bands and dance music.
   ``We grew up hearing the Byrds and Beatles, Jimi Hendrix and the
Doors on the radio,'' Steele said. ``Radio to us has never been a
plastic sellout.''
   The Bangles will spend much of 1989 touring to support a record
they say even moms and dads can love _ they know, because they've
asked theirs.
   ``I played it for my dad,'' Steele said. ``He said, `this is a
much more professional-sounding record.'''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: The History Is His Own</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leon Uris has based much of his work on
historical events. In ``Mitla Pass,'' the history is his own.
   ``I was looking for a legacy to leave my new family and my
grandchildren,'' said Uris, the 64-year-old author of such best
sellers as ``Exodus'' and ``QB VII.''
   ``Mitla Pass'' (Doubleday, $19.95), which closely follows the
lives of Uris and his family, begins in Israel in 1956 during the
time of the Suez Canal crisis and centers on the experiences of the
author's alter ego, Gideon Zadok, a writer covering the incident.
The novel then traces Zadok's ancestry back to the 1880s, allowing
various relatives to tell their stories.
   Uris lives in Aspen, Colo., with his third wife, Jill, and hopes
the book will bring him closer to their two children.
   ``I wanted to leave them with a story of what their old man did
and let them know he was not infallible. ... You spend the second
half of your life getting over your first half,'' he said.
   ``I want them to learn that their daddy gets frightened. That he
makes mistakes. I wanted to humanize the relationship very early.''
   Uris quickly points to his own experience. In ``Mitla Pass,'' the
writer had difficulties with both parents.
   ``Those relationships took me 60 years to get some understanding
_ their relationship with me that hurt me a great deal, brought me a
great deal of pain as a child. What I long for is a better
relationship with my own children.''
   Like Zadok, Uris was born in Baltimore and spent several years
growing up in Norfolk, Va. His father, Wolf William, was a paper
hanger and storekeeper. Uris remembered him as an unhappy man.
   ``I think his personality was formed by the harsh realities of
being a Jew in Czarist Russia,'' he said. ``He was basically a
failure. He went from failure to failure. I think failure formed his
character, made him bitter.
   ``I think I can say without hesitation that from earliest memory
I was determined not to be a failure.''
   Uris credits his mother, Anna, with teaching him an appreciation
of the arts, but says they did not get along.
   ``Her life was such that there was a heavy distrust of men, in
large part because of a very cruel father. We were essentially
disinterested in each other. She was inside of her own head there
somewhere.''
   Uris struggled to establish his own independence and World World
II provided the perfect opportunity.
   ``All societies that I know of are shaped by macho, the need of a
man to be macho,'' said Uris, who served as a marine. ``There's no
better proving ground than a war. The war came along at a time when
I needed to go war. My time had run out at being at home. The war
worked into my life.''
   After the war, he began submitting articles to magazines and
finally had a piece, ``The All American Razzmatazz,'' published in
the January 1951 issue of ``Esquire.''
   His first novel, ``Battle Cry,'' a story about the Marine Corps,
was released in 1953 and made into a film. Two years later, he came
out with ``The Angry Hills,'' a spy novel, and in 1956, traveled to
Israel to begin research on ``Exodus,'' his most famous work. The
novel, which depicted the history of European Jewry from the turn of
the century to the establishment of Israel, was released in 1958 and
sold millions of copies.
   ```Exodus' has been the Bible of the Jewish dissident movement in
Russia,'' Uris said. ``It's referred to as `The Book.'''
   Uris has also written about the Warsaw Ghetto resistance in
``Mila 18,'' post-World War II Germany in ``Armageddon'' and the
Cuban missile crisis in ``Topaz.'' For ``Trinity,'' the story of
three Irish families from the mid-19th century to the Easter Rising
of 1916, Uris was given the Irish Institute's John F. Kennedy Award
in 1976.
   But now the author wants to deal with more personal matters.
   ``My motivation is to be on a one-and-one basis with my readers.
To say, `Look, I'm old enough and wise enough to work in this area
of human relationships.' This is what the world's all about, other
people,'' he said.
   Uris said researching ``Mitla Pass'' made him see himself in an
entirely different way. ``I used to think of myself as a very sad
little Jewish boy, isolated in a Southern town, undersized,
asthmatic.
   ``When I read all my correspondence again, I realized I was a
hustler,'' he said. ``I was tough. I used everything to my
advantage. I could be very ruthless. I hurt a lot of people on the
way up.''
   Now, he said, smiling, ``I'm mellowed out.''
   To research ``Mitla Pass,'' Uris pored through 100,000 pieces of
correspondence, a process that was physically and emotionally
exhausting.
   ``It was painful. I would get to my office at noon and be dead
asleep on my couch at 2. I was so depressed. This book drained me.''
   Yet once he began writing ``Mitla Pass,'' the words came easily.
   ``So much was stored up for so long that I almost set the
typewriter on automatic,'' Uris said. ``It's a wild structure but
it's the way I wrote the first time around.''
   His books are usually enormous in scope, covering extensive
periods of time and requiring painstaking research. He has been
criticized for an overblown writing style and for making his
characters one-dimensional.
   But readers have been unable to resist his epic tales.
   ``I have a good relationship with my readers,'' Uris said. ``If
you haven't anything to say, you sit down and shut up. I feel I have
something to say that has value.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Cindy Walker Writes `Songs With A Face'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cindy Walker, ``the queen of country
music songwriters,'' has spent about half a century writing
recognizable songs that have been recorded by such performers as
Elvis Presley and Bing Crosby.
   The veteran composer, who lives in Mexia, Texas, has written more
than 450 songs that have been recorded. She was a finalist this year
for induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame.
   The best tunes, she said in a telephone interview, ``are songs
with a face.''
   ``You recognize them. You know them. It's like a person. They
have a face that's outstanding. Other songs don't have a face; you
just hear them, that's all. The really good ones are few and far
between.''
   Two of her best known songs are ``You Don't Know Me'' and ``Dream
Baby.''
   ``You Don't Know Me'' has been recorded by more than 75 singers,
including Presley, Ray Charles, Eddy Arnold, Jerry Vale and Mickey
Gilley. Walker wrote the song in the mid-1950s after Arnold
suggested the title, although he had no music or lyrics to go with
it.
   ``I was in Nashville for a music convention and he said, `I've
got a title for you.' He said you've got to promise me to write it.
I was flippant about it (the title) because it didn't strike me at
the time,'' she said.
   ``It's about someone you think you know but you don't. I came on
home and two months later, I was sitting in my chair in my studio
and that song just started singing itself. I was just carried away
with it.
   ``It took me three weeks to finish. Then I called Eddy and sang
it over the phone to him. He had forgotten about it, but he recorded
it three weeks later.''
   Her song ``Dream Baby'' was written in the mid 1960s and was a
hit by Roy Orbison and later Glen Campbell among others.
   ``It's been recorded by lots of people,'' she said. ``I hate to
name names because I leave someone out.''
   Some of her other songs include ``In the Misty Moonlight,''
``Take Me in Your Arms and Hold Me,'' ``China Doll'' and tunes with
a Western flavor such as ``Blue Canadian Rockies,'' ``My Rancho Rio
Grande,'' ``Lone Star Trail'' and ``You're From Texas.''
   For the king of Western swing music, Bob Wills, she wrote
``Bubbles in My Beer,'' ``Cherokee Maiden'' and ``Dusty Skies.''
   Her first big break, though, came in 1942 when she accompanied
her father, a cotton buyer, on a trip to Hollywood. They drove past
the Crosby Building and she decided to try to make an appointment
with Bing Crosby.
   ``I went into the office and asked for Mr. Crosby,'' she
recalled. ``The secretary said Larry or which one. I didn't know
there was but one. So I asked for the first one said named. It was
Larry. He listened and I sang him the song. He said Bing had been
looking for a Western song. He said, `meet me here tomorrow and
we'll let him hear it.' I did.''
   As a result, ``Lone Star Trail'' was recorded by Bing Crosby and
became her first song recorded by someone else.
   ``It started me off,'' she said.
   Later, she signed her own recording contract with Decca Records.
For five years she was a performer and songwriter and appeared in a
few movies but eventually decided to concentrate on composing.
   ``I've always been a songwriter,'' she said. ``Everything was an
offshoot from my writing.''
   Her procedure has been to think of a title and then go from there.
   ``The title tells the story. If you can get a real good title,
you've got something. I always write from the title. I've never
written a song without the title.''
   Melodies flow from the lyrics, she said.
   ``The words and music come together. It just sort of comes to
you. The songs just sing themselves to me. They kind of write
themselves. I just stand back and listen.''
   Walker, who gives her age as ``old enough to know better and
young enough not to care,'' is still writing. Her song, ``Sugar
Moon,'' has recently been recorded by country stars Willie Nelson,
Janie Frickie and K.D. Lang.
   ``I write all the time. It's all I've ever done,'' she said.

   Why use a book to teach children about the life
cycle of the butterfly when they can witness metamorphosis?
   ``One is an aesthetic, hair-raising experience that is just
absolutely dramatic beyond belief. The other, all it is is just
reading another set of symbols,'' said Francis M. Pottenger III,
director of science projects for the Curriculum, Research and
Development Group at the University of Hawaii.
   Substituting words for nature's wonders, unfortunately, is ``what
most of science has been'' over the years, said Pottenger. ``You
destroy science that way. You literally destroy science by putting
it into that form.''
   Pottenger, 60, a former high school science teacher, has
developed a teaching program that replaces books with ``real world''
lessons. Developmental Approaches in Science and Health integrates
science, health and technology with subjects such as literature and
social studies.
   DASH is the elementary equivalent to his Foundational Approaches
in Science Teaching a middle school program used by more than 1,200
districts nationwide.
   He had started FAST in 1966, with money from the University of
Hawaii and the state, to take advantage of Hawaii's ``natural
museum'' environment. It was introduced in Hawaii in 1970 and spread
to the mainland in 1976, being tailored to reflect each district's
needs and natural surroundings.
   ``We wanted to look at the real world in which the child lived,
rather than the textbook world,'' Pottenger said.
   In DASH, instead of lecturing on the importance of sanitation,
for example, teachers are encouraged to whip up some ``germy goo''
out of cocoa and cooking oil that children can dip their fingers
into while listening to a poem or two:
   ``There once was a terrible germ, who was long and looked like a
worm. His favorite trick was to get people sick, so they'd lie on
their back and squirm.''
   Such strategies work wonders, said Ann Baldwin Taylor, director
of the Children's School at Carnegie Mellon University, a campus
laboratory school for research in child development.
   ``If language arts and math and science and you-name-it are all
together ... all of a sudden, the kids click, click, click,'' she
said, snapping her fingers. ```Oh, I get it. I understand and I can
use it here, here, here and here.'''
   Kindergarten teacher Gloria Cannon, whose laboratory school is
affiliated with the State University of New York at Buffalo, is just
as enthusiastic about what she calls DASH's ``whole world'' and
``capturing-the-moment'' approach. ``It allows for the individual.
It's not this is the right answer or the wrong answer. There are
many right answers for the same thing, and many ways to solve one
particular problem,'' Cannon said.
   The trick is getting students to see how science touches their
lives.
   ``Once the child understands and can use the material to
understand their world around them, they're hooked for life,'' Ms.
Taylor said. ``It's when the child doesn't understand ... that you
lose them. They just turn it off.''
   DASH was incorporated this fall into kindergarten and first-grade
curriculums at 10 laboratory schools, which are the same as any
other school except for affiliation with universities. Course
materials are expected to be ready for grades two through six in
1991. It eventually will be offered, like FAST, to public schools
willing to buy the material and have their teachers trained by a
special team of instructors.
   ``The major problem has been that elementary teachers generally
have been frightened by science because they are fearful they're
going to make a mistake,'' Pottenger said. ``It's much easier to
return to the textbook, which gives all the proper answers.''
   With DASH, he said, teachers look not ``so much at textbook
answers but real phenomenon. The phenomenon tell you whether or not
you have actually a proper interpretation.''

   The 8-month-old wasn't fooled when the
stopwatch that had looked so interesting was covered with a cloth.
He yanked the cloth away.
   But research under way around the country suggests he might not
have been so savvy if he hadn't yet begun to crawl.
   Parents know that children experience all kinds of new things
once they begin to crawl: the taste of the cat's food, the allure of
their sister's room.
   But psychologists say crawling also seems to trigger a variety of
developmental milestones babies reach between the ages of six and
nine months. They learn that toys still exist even when hidden,
heights can be dangerous and objects exist that have nothing to do
with themselves.
   Psychologists have attributed such advances to maturation of the
nervous system. But the new research is finding that developmental
changes don't occur before babies are mobile, even if crawling is
delayed several months.
   ``It's nothing short of a psychological revolution,'' said
Rosanne Kermoian, assistant professor of psychology at Reed College.
``We're finding that not only are the changes very dramatic, they're
also very broad.
   ``We think it's not crawling itself ... but the experiences that
are associated with crawling. They have to pay attention to where
they are located in space so when they go room to room they don't
get lost.''
   The research has implications for babies delayed in crawling by
handicaps or injuries, Kermoian said. They don't display the
developmental changes until they begin to crawl, even if that occurs
several months later than average.
   Infants who aren't yet crawling but get around in a walker show
more of the developmental advances than those who aren't mobile at
all, and those who never crawl, but go directly to walking, display
the changes when they begin to walk.
   ``There are certain very specific areas where they are
developmentally delayed,'' she said. ``...If we can show where, the
better we will be able to develop appropriate therapeutic
intervention.''
   The research shows that crawling also seems to trigger babies'
understanding that they aren't the center of the universe, she said.
``What we find is that as children gain experience crawling, they
understand better what the mother is communicating about other
things that are going on in the world. That's a huge change. If a
mother points, the child looks to the event ... rather than looking
at the mother's finger or her face.''
   Kermoian has a wall full of stuffed animals to test whether
babies follow their parents' gazes or pointing fingers to the toys,
or whether they will look only at their parents. This also
translates into watching their parents' reactions to new people
before responding to them.
   ``They're more likely to use the mother to decide what is an
appropriate response...,'' she said. ``At this age, that behavior
isn't perfect, but we're beginning to see it in babies that are
beginning to locomote.''
   Mobility also seems to teach babies wariness of heights and
relationships between objects, Kermoian said.
   Collaborating in the study are Robert Telzrow of the University
of Washington, Joseph Campos of the University of Illinois, and

   George Hitchings knew right
away that Gertrude Elion was special.
   ``We had maybe four or five interviews for this job as an
assistant in the biochemistry department,'' Hitchings recalled.
``But after I talked to Trudy, I told the research director, `This
is the one we're looking for.'''
   Elion, 70, also clearly remembers that meeting.
   ``George didn't ask me any questions. I had three other job
offers, and they had all asked what the last book was that I had
read and that sort of thing. George never did. He just started
talking about what they were doing. He was so excited about it that
I thought, `This is the place I want to work.'''
   That 1944 job interview launched a lifelong collaboration
developing medicines for leukemia, malaria, gout, herpes and kidney
transplant rejection _ a collaboration that led to a share of this
year's Nobel Prize for medicine.
   ``When we started it was all trial and error,'' Hitchings said.
``You'd develop a compound and take some kind of target _ usually a
mouse _ plug it in and see what it did or didn't do. Over the last
40 years, there has been more shifting to our system.''
   Hitchings and Elion's ``rational'' approach involves probing the
chemistry behind a disease and then developing chemical compounds to
fight it.
   Elion said she and Hitchings had been successful partners for 44
years because they ``just kept working. There was no time for
anything else.''
   And neither of them was concerned about who got the credit.
   ``As the scope of our work grew and I took on assistants of my
own, we would spend a lot of time talking through a problem,'' she
said. ``By the end of our discussions, we'd usually come up with an
approach, but neither one of us would remember who had originally
come up with the approach. There never was any of this, `Oh, that
was my idea,' between us.''
   Elion, never married, and Hitchings, a widower since 1985, are
officially retired from Burroughs Wellcome. But they both report
every day when they're not on the road lecturing. ``People around
here just laugh when I say I'm retired,'' Elion said. ``I do like to
stay busy.
   ``What's the use of retiring? If you don't have anything to
contribute any more, people will tell you. But as long as you can
make a contribution, you should. Science is a continuum. If the
older ones don't pass along their knowledge to the younger ones, it
comes to a dead stop.''

   Why use a book to teach children about the life
cycle of the butterfly when they can witness metamorphosis?
   ``One is an aesthetic, hair-raising experience that is just
absolutely dramatic beyond belief. The other, all it is is just
reading another set of symbols,'' said Francis M. Pottenger III,
director of science projects for the Curriculum, Research and
Development Group at the University of Hawaii.
   Substituting words for nature's wonders, unfortunately, is ``what
most of science has been'' over the years, said Pottenger. ``You
destroy science that way. You literally destroy science by putting
it into that form.''
   Pottenger, 60, a former high school science teacher, has
developed a teaching program that replaces books with ``real world''
lessons. Developmental Approaches in Science and Health integrates
science, health and technology with subjects such as literature and
social studies.
   DASH is the elementary equivalent to his Foundational Approaches
in Science Teaching a middle school program used by more than 1,200
districts nationwide.
   DASH was incorporated this fall into kindergarten and first-grade
curriculums at 10 laboratory schools affiliated with universities.
Materials are expected to be ready for grades two through six in
1991. It eventually will be offered, like FAST, to public schools
willing to buy the material and have their teachers trained by a
special team of instructors.
   Kindergarten teacher Gloria Cannon, whose laboratory school is
affiliated with the State University of New York at Buffalo, is
enthusiastic about what she calls DASH's ``whole world'' and
``capturing-the-moment'' approach.

<HEAD>Research Ties Crawling to Psychological Revolution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 8-month-old wasn't fooled when the
stopwatch that had looked so interesting was covered with a cloth.
He yanked the cloth away.
   But research under way around the country suggests he might not
have been so savvy if he hadn't yet begun to crawl.
   Parents know that children experience all kinds of new things
once they begin to crawl: the taste of the cat's food, the allure of
their sister's room.
   But psychologists say crawling also seems to trigger a variety of
developmental milestones babies reach between the ages of six and
nine months. They learn that toys still exist even when hidden,
heights can be dangerous and objects exist that have nothing to do
with themselves.
   Psychologists have attributed such advances to maturation of the
nervous system. But the new research is finding that developmental
changes don't occur before babies are mobile, even if crawling is
delayed several months.
   ``It's nothing short of a psychological revolution,'' said
Rosanne Kermoian, assistant professor of psychology at Reed College.
``We're finding that not only are the changes very dramatic, they're
also very broad.
   ``We think it's not crawling itself ... but the experiences that
are associated with crawling. They have to pay attention to where
they are located in space so when they go room to room they don't
get lost.''
   The research has implications for babies delayed in crawling by
handicaps or injuries, Kermoian said. They don't display the
developmental changes until they begin to crawl, even if that occurs
several months later than average.
   Infants who aren't yet crawling but get around in a walker show
more of the developmental advances than those who aren't mobile at
all, and those who never crawl, but go directly to walking, display
the changes when they begin to walk.
   ``There are certain very specific areas where they are
developmentally delayed,'' she said. ``...If we can show where, the
better we will be able to develop appropriate therapeutic
intervention.''

<HEAD>New Advances Will Broaden Use of Custom-Made Joint Implants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DUESSELDORF, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advances in computer imaging
techniques and biomedical research will significantly expand the use
of custom-made joint and bone implants in the coming years,
specialists say.
   ``The technology and research is moving at a far greater pace
than we expected,'' said orthopedic surgeon Dr. David Stulberg, one
of several hundred doctors, reseachers and other specialists at the
first international symposium on custom-made prostheses here last
month.
   ``We have learned that a great deal is being done in Europe that
we can profit from,'' said Stulberg, of Northwestern University in
Chicago.
   He said he was impressed by a method developed by West Berlin
researchers to reduce the distortion in test images of implanted
metal joints, allowing doctors to better judge the success of the
operation.
   Custom-made joint replacements are a relatively new development
in orthopedic surgery, and their use is not yet widespread, Stulberg
said. ``The use of custom-made joint replacements is growing by
about 100 percent a year. Their use will spread as orthopedic
surgeons learn more about them.''
   Follow-up studies of patients who have received custom-made
joints indicate they perform better than traditional ``off the shelf
prostheses,'' he said.
   Most replacement hip, knee, ankle, elbow, shoulder and finger
joints are made in a small range of sizes designed to fit
average-sized patients. However, such devices don't fit all patients
and certain medical conditions require the use of a custom-made
prostheses.
   With the use of sophisticated computer and design technology, the
devices can be constructed to give a ``near perfect fit,'' said
Clyde Pratt, president of Techmedica, a Camarillo, Calif., company
that makes replacement joints.
   ``We think this is the method of the future,'' Pratt said, adding
that the costs of custom-made devices should go down as research
costs decline. Custom-fitted joints now can cost up to twice as much
as non-custom replacements.

   George Hitchings knew right
away that Gertrude Elion was special.
   ``We had maybe four or five interviews for this job as an
assistant in the biochemistry department,'' Hitchings recalled.
``But after I talked to Trudy, I told the research director, `This
is the one we're looking for.'''
   Elion, 70, also clearly remembers that meeting.
   ``George didn't ask me any questions. I had three other job
offers, and they had all asked what the last book was that I had
read and that sort of thing. George never did. He just started
talking about what they were doing. He was so excited about it that
I thought, `This is the place I want to work.'''
   That 1944 job interview launched a lifelong collaboration
developing medicines for leukemia, malaria, gout, herpes and kidney
transplant rejection _ a collaboration that led to a share of this
year's Nobel Prize for medicine.
   ``When we started it was all trial and error,'' Hitchings said.
``You'd develop a compound and take some kind of target _ usually a
mouse _ plug it in and see what it did or didn't do. Over the last
40 years, there has been more shifting to our system.''
   Hitchings and Elion's ``rational'' approach to pharmacology
involves probing the chemistry behind a disease and then developing
chemical compounds to fight it.
   Hitchings had been working on nucleic acids at Burroughs Wellcome
Corp. for two years as the company's only biochemist when he hired
Elion.
   She had a master's degree in chemistry from New York University
at the time and went part-time for two or three years, but my
professor told me if I wanted a Ph.D., I would have to go full-time.
I told him I couldn't do that because I liked my job too much.''
   Hitchings, however, had no reservations about her abilities.
   ``That's the great thing about industry,'' he said, pointing to
other scientists at Burroughs Wellcome who do not have doctorates.
``I think that is maybe more important in academia than it is here.''
   Besides, ``She could have had a doctorate at any time. There was
never any question about that.'' Elion later was awarded honorary
doctorates, making her _ in her words _ an ``honest woman.''
   Elion wanted a career in research, but ended up teaching high
school among other jobs after earning a chemistry degree from Hunter
College. World War II helped her get into the field she wanted.
   ``At the time, women really weren't expected to go into those
kinds of jobs,'' she said. ``But the war had taken all the men, so
that gave me my opportunity.''
   Hitchings, too, had wandered through other jobs _ at Harvard and
Western Reserve universities _ before getting the work he wanted in
research. ``I got my (doctoral) degree at Harvard at the bottom of
the Depression. There simply were no jobs, really. So I kind of
pieced together a living until Burroughs Wellcome came along. In the
back of my mind, I knew what I wanted to do.''
   Elion said she and Hitchings had been successful partners for 44
years because they ``just kept working. There was no time for
anything else.''
   And neither of them was concerned about who got the credit.
   ``As the scope of our work grew and I took on assistants of my
own, we would spend a lot of time talking through a problem,'' she
said. ``By the end of our discussions, we'd usually come up with an
approach, but neither one of us would remember who had originally
come up with the approach. There never was any of this, `Oh, that
was my idea,' between us.''
   Elion, never married, and Hitchings, a widower since 1985, are
officially retired from Burroughs Wellcome. But they both report
every day when they're not on the road lecturing. ``People around
here just laugh when I say I'm retired,'' Elion said. ``I do like to
stay busy.''
   Hitchings also has stayed busy with charity. ``My life now is
about one-third philanthropy and two-thirds science,'' he said.
   In 1983, he founded the Greater Triangle Community Foundation, a
confederation of charities that make grants to area non-profit
agencies. His $130,000 share of the Nobel Prize will go to the
George and Beverly Hitchings Endowment, established by friends and
relatives for the foundation in 1985 to mark his 80th birthday.
   Hitchings met his wife when he moved from his home state of
Washington to study for his doctorate at Harvard. He took a room in
the home of a Methodist minister, and one of the minister's
daughters, Beverly, caught his eye.
   ``Within a few weeks, we were committed for life,'' Hitchings
said. ``She was my greatest encouragement and biggest fan.''
   She also kept a close eye on him when he became too involved with
research, sometimes taking their two children to the lab to drag him
out to dinner.
   ``I remember one morning I got up and made a sandwich, stuck it
in my pocket and headed down to the lab. I figured it must be some
kind of holiday because there wasn't anyone around but me.
   ``I worked all day, ate my sandwich at lunch, and when I got
home, Beverly said, `George, do you realize you just spent New
Year's Day at the lab?' I really hadn't thought of it.''
   Elion created an extended family of young scientists and serves
as a doting aunt to her nieces and nephews and their children.
   ``My brother had the foresight to marry and have four children,''
she said of her brother, Herbert, a physicist who lives in
California. ``I was fairly one-sided, spending most of my time
working.''
   ``She's always been `Aunt Trudy' to my family, too,'' Hitchings
said.
   An opera buff, she makes frequent trips to New York, her
hometown. She also is an avid world traveler. ``One of my friends
said it would make a shorter list if I just put down the places I
haven't been,'' she said.
   Elion said she had no regrets that her work had kept her from a
``normal'' family life. ``I might have if what I was doing was not
so much fun. My mother used to ask me the same thing. I'd bring work
home on the weekend and she'd always say, `Does your boss know
you're bringing work home every weekend?'
   ``And I'd always tell her I wasn't doing it for him. I was doing
it for me.''
   She intends to keep up her daily trips to the lab. ``What's the
use of retiring? If you don't have anything to contribute any more,
people will tell you. But as long as you can make a contribution,
you should.
   ``Science is a continuum. If the older ones don't pass along
their knowledge to the younger ones, it comes to a dead stop.''

   From the start, Barb Goldman's recipe for
scallops didn't have a chance.
   Out they came, steaming hot and fresh from one of the 10 test
kitchens for Better Homes and Gardens magazine, served in tiny
portions for a group of food editors gathered in a taste test.
   ``I think it's pretty watery and the sauce doesn't stick to the
pasta,'' said Ms. Goldman, a senior associate food editor. Using
outlines from other recipes, she had assembled a group of recipes to
appear in Better Homes next spring, but first they had to pass the
magazine's test kitchen test.
   Everyone at the table agreed about the consistency, so the
question became whether to reduce the amount of sauce or keep the
volume and make it thicker. In its second test, it was decided, the
recipe will include two teaspoons of cornstarch, which helps
coagulate sauces.
   Someone else said the dish didn't have much sass, so a bit of
lemon pepper was added. Shredded carrots will be substituted for red
peppers next time.
   And so it went for the other recipes as well. Each was tested for
taste, appearance, nutritional value and ease of preparation, and
each was sent packing with a list of changes. The adjusted recipes
will be prepared and tested again, to be published only after the
testers are satisfied.
   Uncounted magazines send out recipes and many have their own test
kitchens, but Better Homes, circulation about 8 million, says it has
the largest test operation.
   Some 11,200 recipe tests are done each year, and each is tested
at least twice, the second time with changes ordered by the food
testers. Almost all of the ingredients are readily available
national brands.
   ``Our recipes are very do-able for a wide variety of cooks, from
the beginner to the accomplished cook,'' says Nancy Byal, executive
food editor for Better Homes. ``When we print a recipe, we guarantee
that it will not only work, but it will taste good.''
   ``People do have limited time, and if they prepare one of our
recipes, they know they won't have a failure,'' says Sharon
Stilwell, director of the test kitchens.
   ``If we tell them it takes 20 minutes to do, then it will take 20
minutes,'' she says. ``Unless the phone rings or something.''
   To make sure the recipes are do-able, the test kitchens are set
up to resemble the ones in average homes, with normal-sized ranges
and other appliances. The cooks are home economists skilled in
different types of food preparation, but they're also attuned to the
abilities of their readers.
   ``We have to make it foolproof so it works every time,'' says Ms.
Byal. The cooks at home, she says, have neither the time nor the
temperament to experiment with complex recipes that need tinkering.
   She says the business of publishing recipes has come a long way
since the first one by Better Homes went out in 1922, six years
before the test kitchens were established. That early recipe told
cooks to mix berries, put them in a shell and heat the combination
until it became a pie.
   ``There was nothing on adding sugar or even on how long to cook
it,'' says Ms. Byal, explaining that the turn-of-the-century cook
had enough knowledge to fill in the blanks.
   Cooks today have less time to prepare meals and they demand
recipes of greater variety and nutritional value, she says.
   Ms. Stilwell says the tests aim for unbiased results. They won't
rule out green peppers just because one tester doesn't like them,
for example, and the milder foods will get their tests ahead of
dishes that might dominate the palate, such as sweet or spicy hot
items.
   The testers say regional tastes are not a factor. Although the
testers are Midwestern, most have broad food experience.
   ``You name it, they've seen it,'' says Ms. Goldman of the food
editors. ``These are very sophisticated food people.''
   Special testers are assembled for special tastes, however. ``We
know who the fire mouths are around here and who are the baby
mouths,'' says Ms. Stilwell. The fire mouths would be assembled to
test chili recipes. To judge recipes aimed at children, the editors
assembled a batch of children to do the testing.
   On rare occasions, says Ms. Byal, a recipe appearing in Better
Homes doesn't meet the magazine's standards.
   But mostly, the testers said, the problem with recipes that don't
work is that the cooks don't follow directions.
   The editors told stories of cooks who tried to take a little
sugar out of the jelly recipe to make it low-calorie, ending up with
sauce that never coagulated. Another got unusual results by trying
to substitute diet margarine.
   ``To me, it's kind of a challenge, a mystery to find out what
went wrong,'' says Ms. Byal.

   One Sunday evening in Alaska, upscale
Anchorage restaurateur Jens Hansen proudly served rare saddle of
chamois to the venerable gourmet society Confrerie de la Chaine Des
Rotiseurs.
   For that gastronomical victory, and the finding and delivery of
the rare antelope meat on short notice, Hansen had to thank the
suburban San Francisco storefront Night Bird Game & Poultry Co.,
which can supply shoulder of black bear with the ease of a
supermarket selling a chuck roast.
   Night Bird is a standout, but not alone, among the nation's $10
billion gourmet specialty businesses that provide exotic food and
drink for an American public increasingly on the lookout for
trappings of the good life.
   ``It was amazing,'' said Hansen, both of the juicy roasts and
Night Bird founder Gerald E. Prolman's ability to find a 50-pound
cache of the rare meat in New Zealand. The gustatory brotherhood
``raved about it,'' said Hansen.
   For Prolman, Americans who look for quality in what they eat must
include such unlikely critters as rattlesnake, bear, alligator,
buffalo and beaver, and such toothsome fungi as shiitakes, morels
and chanterelles.
   Night Bird supplies some of the best-known restaurants in America
with meat raised for the table. For Prolman, a top-class
chef-turned-supplier, his business in San Bruno just south of San
Francisco is an ongoing effort to convince Americans that ``game is
not an exotic category. It is essential on a well-balanced classical
menu.''
   Food specialists looking for simple answers regularly sneer that
this country has no cuisine of its own, barring fried chicken, hot
dogs, chili and the like. But these doomsayers are wrong, says a man
in the know.
   ``I think America is defining a cuisine at last,'' says Narsai
David, a chef, author, talk show host and restaurateur.
   In general, the incredible amount and variety of fresh foods
available in all parts of the United States comprise this nation's
culinary philosophy. That's unlike France or Italy, for example,
where there's a set style for the preparation of food, said David.
   Another gourmet success story is the year-old San Francisco-based
Heritage Kitchen Specialty Foods, which annually produces 3 million
Effie Marie rum-soaked cakes dripping in butter and calories.
   From Bloomingdales in New York to Marshall Fields in Chicago, and
Macy's nationwide, the outrageous, two-pound desserts sell for
$17.50 a copy. To make sure every possible American gets properly
hooked, Heritage Kitchen gives away samples of its golden vanilla,
spiced apple walnut, lemon poppyseed and chocolate fudge to 180,000
people a year.
   Burberry's, the British firm best known for its clothing exports,
this fall introduced a collection of fine English foods to specialty
food stores and departments throughout the United States.
   The product lineup, both individual items and gift packs,
includes British teas, biscuits, shortcakes, preserves, marmalades,
chutney, mustards, and plum pudding.

   Hospital food, long considered in the mediocre
genre that includes airline and school cafeteria fare, is having a
coming out party.
   Make that going out, as in catering.
   Although still uncommon, hospitals are catering weddings, picnics
and graduation parties. A trend could develop as more hospital
kitchens get into the act.
   ``People are going to want to be sick to come to Bi-County,''
says Wally Wozniak, assistant director of Food and Services of
Bi-County Hospital in the Detroit suburb of Warren.
   The menu at Bi-County stays away from the traditional fried
chicken and roast beef.
   ``We serve different types of chicken, such as champagne chicken,
or chicken cacciatore. You can have quiche everyday if you want,''
Wozniak says.
   You can also choose buttered egg noodles with parsley instead of
mostaccioli pasta.
   Five Seattle-area hospitals offer espresso and cappuccino on
site. A Bloomington, Ind., hospital has done so well with its bakery
that restaurants purchase cookies and cakes from them.
   Hospitals in California, Oregon and Illinois plan similar
operations, says Jan Shulman of the American Hospital Association in
Chicago.
   Apparently, even the experts are finding hospital food to their
liking.
   Northern Dutchess Hospital in Rhinebeck, N.Y., catered a staff
picnic for the Culinary Institute of America, among the country's
most prestigious schools for chefs, Shulman says.
   Just as in a restaurant, a hostess at Chicago's Northwestern
Memorial Hospital visits all patients after their meals are served
to ensure the food is satisfactory and the patient received
everything that was ordered.
   Being rather new, success depends mainly on word of mouth. That
is spreading quickly.
   ``We have been doing this for over a year and have been pretty
successful. Most of our business comes from referrals from past
users. We've done weddings, showers, graduation and office
parties,'' says Wozniak, who has a degree in hotel and restaurant
management.
   Elaine Havern had her wedding catered by the hospital.
   ``The food was excellent. People were asking where it had come
from,'' says Havern, whose previous caterer canceled seven weeks
before the wedding.
   ``There was nothing traditional about the menu,'' she says. ``We
had beef tenderloin and chicken almondine. It was more gourmet.''
   And the competition for the new business is keen, Shulman says.
   ``Hospitals are trying to create an environment where someone can
choose one hospital over another,'' she says. ``They want to make
the experience a pleasant one.''

   Every four years, hundreds of the
world's top chefs mix it up in an event known as the Culinary
Olympics, a prestigious competition that has bolstered America's
reputation as a leader in gourmet cooking.
   Competing against 1,000 chefs from 30 countries that for the
first time included China and Malaysia, American master cooks this
year won the gold medal in the hot food category for a record third
time in a row.
   The hot food gold medal is awarded after 150 visitors at the
event join 15 gourmet judges in tasting the competing dishes.
   The winning U.S. hot food recipe: Chesapeake oyster consomme
soup, an entree of Napa Valley squab with lentils, cabbage and rye
turnovers, topped off with a delicacy entitled ``Big Apple'' dessert
with kiln-dried cherry sauce.
   It is the only category of food that is actually consumed at the
cooking and baking bash that has it roots in a competition that
started in Frankfurt in 1894.
   The gourmet competition has grown into the most important event
of its kind, assuming the nickname of Culinary Olympics. It is
always held in Frankfurt.
   This year's event, staged at Frankfurt's huge fairgrounds
complex, drew 60,000 visitors to the world's largest display of
gourmet delicacies.
   The most prestigious gold medal, in the overall category, went to
Switzerland, with West Germany winning the silver and the U.S. team
the bronze.
   National teams competed in four categories _ show platters, hot
meals displayed cold, hot food competition and pastries.
   The Swiss won in two of the four categories and placed second in
hot meals displayed cold.
   Their recipes consisted of an assortment of pastries and show
plates, including a light foamy creamed corn with veal thymus,
rolled beef and veal cutlets with basil, a heavy red wine sauce, and
chocolate tureen with truffels.
   But the Swiss gold was based on food displays, which are works of
art and food for the eye but not meant to be eaten.
   West Germany took the silver medal and Norway the bronze in the
hot food category.
   National team members representing the United States were headed
by team manager Ferdinand E. Metz, president of the Culinary
Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y.
   Other team members included masters chefs Timothy Ryan and Mark
Erickson, also of the Culinary Institute, Daniel Hugelier of the
Amway Plaza Hotel in Grand Rapids, Mich., and Hartmut Handke of the
Greenbrier restaurant in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va.
   Pastry chef for the U.S. national team was Christopher Northmore
of the Cherokee Town and Country Club, Atlanta, Ga.
   Canada, defending overall champion from the 1984 Culinary
Olympics, placed third in show platters and hot meals displayed
cold. Malaysia, competing for the first time, won a respectable
bronze in the pastries category.
   The Culinary Olympics food fair was held in Frankfurt Oct. 16-20.

   An Alaska beverage producer hoping for
spirited competition with the Soviets has begun bottling vodka made
with glacier water.
   Mark Wilson, president of Alaska Mountaintop Spirits Co., said
the Attakiska vodka that his firm began bottling in November will be
sold intially in Alaska and in Eastern states, with sales later
expected to reach other parts of the United States plus some Pacific
Rim nations.
   Wilson said he expects an immediate monthly demand for 2,000 to
3,000 cases of the new vodka. Three percent of total sales are
targeted for Alaska, he said.
   ``While people are, on the whole, drinking less, they are more
discriminating in what they are drinking,'' Wilson said. ``Today's
consumer is more sophisticated and is willing to spend the few extra
dollars it takes to buy the best vodka available.''
   He also said he is relying on the Alaska mystique to draw people
to the product for a first-time sip.
   ``The mystique and character of Alaska will be key to breaching
the stronghold of the established market leaders,'' Wilson said.
   The production process is described as one that takes the Soviet
method a step further through use of ``the pure and distinctive
glacier waters available in Alaska'' and through a special finishing
process.
   Wilson said he has been working with a Stamford, Conn., marketing
firm to launch the vodka. His other products include Alaska bottled
water and bagged beverage ice chipped from Alaska glaciers.
   He said the Anchorage vodka plant is a $500,000, high-speed
facility built to produce more than 5 million bottles of vodka
annually. He is offering two sizes, with suggested retail prices of
$12 and $16. The bottles bear a label with an eagle and a star, and
carry a pewter-colored seal stamped with the words ``Made in
Alaska...Attakiska.''
   Wilson said that by year's end he expects to operate with two
shifts involving a total of 21 full- and part-time employees.
   ``The vodka market is huge,'' he said, and the percentage of U.S.
demand met with imported versions of the drink has been increasing
in recent years.
   Educated as a zoologist, Wilson, 40, said he got into the
beverage business after he and a partner, Mick McKay, started a
business in the field of water treatment.
   With much of that enterprise related to the oil industry,
activity for the men dwindled as the oil boom flattened, Wilson
said. He and McKay had been developing a consumer division in their
firm, Wetco Inc., and those operations carried them through the bad
times in the petroleum industry, he said.

   Southerners drank more alcoholic beverages
than residents of any other U.S. region last year, and households
with incomes above $35,000 drank more than any other income group, a
study found.
   The study, released by the alcoholic beverage research
publication Impact, was based on diaries kept by 12,000 people
during 1987. The survey, compiled by NFO Research Inc. of Toledo,
Ohio, covered beverage consumption by location, time of day, sex,
age, geographic region and household income.
   The South, when considered as one of four U.S. regions, drank the
most alcoholic beverages _ 32.3 percent of all consumed _ followed
by the Northeast at 24.8 percent, the North Central region at 24.1
percent and the West at 18.8 percent. But the West led the nation in
wine consumption, at 31.3 percent of all wine drunk.
   Southerners drank 39.2 percent of all wine coolers and 33.8
percent of beer, leading in those categories. Consumption of
distilled spirits, or hard liquor, was almost evenly divided among
the four regions.

   Neil LeClerc clearly is one guy you wouldn't want
to mess with on the wrestling mat _ or in the kitchen.
   At 24, LeClerc has a solid hold on two divergent careers. In
fact, when they're in season, many of the wrestlers who train under
LeClerc try to think about anything but food. Making weight is all
that matters and the delicacies that come out of LeClerc's kitchen
wouldn't help that cause.
   ``They have joked about it,'' LeClerc says of the wrestlers he
coached at Troy High School last season. ``They would make comments
like, `Are you going to make us something to eat after practice,
coach?'''
   As a macho sport, wrestling seems to have little in common with
catering.
   But LeClerc points to the precision of preparing a special food
dish and the technique needed to successfully perform a difficult
wrestling move.
   LeClerc's business, called Charmont, is busier than ever these
days. With wrestling season coming, the gas on the stove will be
turned down as the heat on the mat is turned up.
   LeClerc is in his first season as head coach at Southfield High
School, where the wrestling program has been lackluster in recent
years.
   When athletic director Art Carinci heard LeClerc was a caterer,
he was pleased.
   ``My reaction was, `That sounds great. He could cater our sports
banquet,''' Carinci says.
   But Carinci says LeClerc was hired for his wrestling, not his
culinary, credentials. After the job was posted among teachers and
staff, Carinci interviewed and hired LeClerc, whose catering
business is in nearby Royal Oak, Mich.
   LeClerc has been wrestling since kindergarten; his kitchen career
began at 13 when he weighed dough at a pizza parlor owned by a
family friend. Then came the sauce. Later, he experimented with
homemade soups at the Maple House restaurant.
   LeClerc has worked in other restaurants and, in 1987, he received
an associate degree in culinary arts.
   ``It was realizing that I had a talent early,'' LeClerc says.
``There were certain things I could do that other people in the
restaurant who were much older and more experienced couldn't do.''
   While he has plenty of wedding and church business right now,
LeClerc is probably two years away from opening his own kitchen.
When that happens, he has a new name in mind, ``What Dreams Are Made
Of.''
   LeClerc says he sees his kitchen vocation as helping his coaching
job.
   ``Maybe if I did do the sports banquet and the basketball coach
liked the food, he'd give up the gym one or two days a week so the
wrestling team could use it,'' he says.
   LeClerc says he knows of no colleagues who cook at all, let alone
to make a living. The federal government doesn't either.
   ``We keep track of people who have two jobs but we kind of keep a
little more in the mainstream,'' says Kathryn Hoyle, a spokeswoman
for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

<TEXT>
   With more than 25,000 restaurants within its
borders, New York City might well be considered the culinary
crossroads of the world.
   Diners can choose from what the New York Convention and Visitors
Bureau describes as a ``cornucopia of international cuisines,''
including Brazilian, Cajun, Chinese, French, German, Greek, Indian,
Italian, Japanese, Mexican, Russian, Spanish, Thai or Vietnamese
specialties.
   But at Rockefeller Center, in the very heart of Manhattan,
patrons also might encounter such attractions as ``Breakfast at the
O.K. Corral,'' lunch selections from ``The Firefighter's Cookbook,''
or a dinner menu built around recipes borrowed from the tasty meals
served to Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey circus performers.
   Such offbeat items are most often seen on the menus of the
American Festival Cafe, one of three restaurants wrapped around the
famed ice-skating rink (which becomes an open air garden cafe during
the warm weather season).
   The other two eateries are the elegant Sea Grill, which
specializes in seafood, and Savories, a casual restaurant geared to
speedy service and takeout delectables. The emphasis at all three is
on all-American dining. The wine list is strictly domestic and the
beer choices feature regional American brews.
   Customers at the American Festival when the ``O.K. Corral''
breakfast was offered in 1986 found such imaginative menu offerings
as apples baked in bourbon, eggs scrambled with frizzled beef jerky,
oatmeal flapjacks with molasses-stewed prunes and Judge Roy Bean's
beans.
   Ruth Epstein, who has helped plan and promote such
off-the-beaten-track themes since the restaurant opened four years
ago, explains how beans usually were prepared in the judge's ``Wild
West'' days:
   ``By the time the pale pink beans called Arizona strawberries had
cooked all night in their covering of bourbon, onions, molasses,
salt pork and spices, the bourbon's alcohol had entirely evaporated,
leaving behind only the mellow smoky flavor of Kentucky's pride as a
reminder of the previous evening's carouse.''
   According to Miss Epstein, public relations consultant for
Restaurant Associates, which operates the three eateries, adopting
new themes and changing menus several times a year is not a simple
task _ especially when the restaurant serves about 450,000 meals
annually, matching the combined total of 450,000 meals served at the
other two restaurants.
   ``It's not the easiest thing in the world to do with a
restaurant, because change _ as it is for people _ is difficult for
restaurants. You have to extend yourself to change rather than keep
on doing the same thing,'' she explains.
   ``Changing a menu requires an extraordinary pulling together of a
very large team. Everybody has to cooperate when you have a
change...When I have an idea _ sometimes even supplying recipes for
them _ the chef is always there because the cooking people are
involved from the beginning.
   ``There's also the purchasing and marketing departments, and the
liquor buyers, and so on. Then when the new menu is set and tested
and ready to be printed on paper it involves everybody in the
restaurant who serves it.
   ``There are meetings by our management staff to teach people who
serve it what it is, how it looks, how it tastes, how it's served.''
   When ``firehouse cooking'' was the theme early last year, the
program was billed as a tribute to America's firehouse chefs. All of
the recipes were created by firefighters and most were taken from
John Sineno's best-selling ``The Firefighter's Cookbook.''
   During the testing of the chef's cooking of recipes being
considered for the menu, the Firefighters Tasting Panel discovered
something new, Miss Epstein recalls.
   As she explained in the American Festival newsletter:
   ``They pointed out that there must be some mistake in the
manicotti _ delicious as it was (and please pass some more) theirs
had never had a sauce like that. It took our forensic team some time
to determine that two recipes had inadvertently been combined and
that Danny Prince's manicotti had been topped with a sauce based on
his artichoke pie. Thus are great dishes born.''
   It was named ``Manicotti with Accidental Sauce'' and was the
first dish to earn a place on the firehouse cooking menu.
   The circus theme featured a menu recalling the days when Ringling
Brothers and company played under canvas and traveled on a train a
hundred cars long, carrying some 1,400 people, lions, tigers and
elephants.
   The fun menu, ``The Cooking of the Circus Stars,'' was printed in
red, white and blue and borrowed the traditional hyperbole of circus
promotions. It declared the offerings as ``The Most Gorgeous and
Princely Spectacle of Monumental Magnificence Ever Beforked.''

   A movie glutton's fantasy day:
   Join THE BREAKFAST CLUB for BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S. Try the
BANANAS.
   For lunch, a snack, perhaps MYSTIC PIZZA.
   Or, consider a PICNIC or LUNCH ON THE GRASS, with a COLD TURKEY
hero or sandwich. (A HERO AIN'T NOTHING BUT A SANDWICH.)
   Then, of course, DINNER at EIGHT. But where? THE DINER? DINNER AT
THE RITZ? DINNER AT ANDRE'S? Or perhaps A CATERED AFFAIR at ALICE'S
RESTAURANT, or THE STORK CLUB (but don't go WITHOUT RESERVATIONS).
   Other possibilities: THE STAGE DOOR CANTEEN or the CABARET.
   Or, a CLAMBAKE.
   If Chinese food sounds good, try the TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON
and trust you won't get BITTER RICE. Bring friends, because WITH SIX
YOU GET EGGROLL. And don't leave without your FORTUNE COOKIE.
   But then, you might prefer ROOM SERVICE.
   Wherever you decide, you might start with LA BONNE SOUPE, or DUCK
SOUP (with ANIMAL CRACKERS), and, if you're really hungry, follow
with BABETTE'S FEAST (blini with black caviar, quail stuffed with
foie gras).
   Skip the corn (you know why).
   For dessert, WILD STRAWBERRIES.
   The result? FAT CITY.

   A lucky 1,750 lottery
winners delight each Christmas to the toasts and tastes of the
annual Bracebridge dinner at Yosemite National Park, complete with
snow if you're even luckier.
   The toasts are echoed by the Andrea Fulton Chorale and the
Bracebridge cast from the San Francisco area, some of them having
been involved with the dinner for more than 30 years. The tastes are
those of a sumptuous seven-course dinner in the high-ceilinged,
log-beamed Ahwahnee Hotel.
   Five seatings of 350 revelers each are held yearly, two on Dec.
22, one on Christmas Eve and two on Christmas Day. The four-hour
pageant is set amidst Squire Bracebridge's Yorkshire Christmas
celebration adapted from Washington Irving's ``Sketch Book'' account
of Christmas at Bracebridge Hall, a fictional English country estate
in the late 1700s.
   Naturalist-photographer Ansel Adams helped start the lavish feast
in 1927, the year the hotel opened. Adams was the first jester, the
Lord of Misrule, and, in 1929, assumed the role of director. Four
years after his death, Adams' spirit still pervades the period-dress
gathering, ironically with a ban on cameras.
   Once a guest has beaten the greater than 10-1 odds of being
chosen in the $100 dinner lottery, he or she is advised by letter to
keep in line with long-standing tradition. ``We insist that all
Bracebridge Dinner guests refrain from bringing cameras into the
dinner room,'' Bill Wymore, general manager of the Ahwahnee, says.
``This policy was established at the request of Ansel Adams to
preserve the atmosphere of Bracebridge Hall.''
   Each course begins with a whimsical prelude. When the boar's head
and the Baron of the Beef are presented to a lavishly dressed Squire
Bracebridge, played by a stout local actor, the baron is knighted
Sir Loin. The diners, seated at large round tables, get more into
the spirit of the evening as the courses progress at the base of an
altar-like head table. The squire and his cast of characters,
including the jester and a dancing bear, lead the revelry and are
presented each course for approval, with song.
   The dinner, billed as semi-formal to formal, grows more
effervescent as it progresses from peacock pie (crepe of goose with
juniperberry sauce) to boar's head (roast sirloin of beef) to plum
pudding with hard sauce.
   To be eligible for the dinner drawing, one has to plan ahead. The
deadline for the 1988 Christmas dinners was Jan. 15. To receive an
application for next year, call or write Reservations Dept.,
Attention: Bracebridge Dinner, Yosemite Park and Curry Co., 5410 E.

   There's no longer a need to whine about the cork that
accidentally falls into the wine bottle. Cork retrievers are
available, generally for less than $10.
   Some other wine accessories:
   _ Thermocool, with vacuum-sealed double sides available in
contemporary or crystal cut, will keep the wine bottle cold for
hours.
   _ Vacu-vin will keep open wine fresh for days, by removing most
of the oxygen in the bottle.

   Chicken, fish and fresh vegetables rated the most healthy among
foods in a survey of adult consumer habits, and more people consider
pizza very good for you than they do pork.
   The results come from a 1987 Yankelovich Monitor Report, a
national sampling survey reported in Successful Farming magazine.
   Chicken was the meat respondents were most likely to eat fairly
regularly, the choice of 84 percent. Twenty percent rated beef as
``very good for you,'' 13 percent felt that way about pizza,
followed by coffee (10 percent) and pork.
   Of the adults sampled, 65 percent said they were eating the same
amount of beef they did a year previous, 26 percent said they were
eating less and 8 percent responded more.

   Samuel Johnson once defined oats as ``a grain, which in England
is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people.''
   Indeed, oats can provide a varied menu.
   The cereal grass is sometimes ground or rolled into meal or
flakes, for oatmeal.
   Or made into a thin, flat oatcake.
   James Walker, managing director of The Walkers Bakery, of
Scotland, says oatcakes have been found to be more nutritional, with
recent studies indicating that eating oat products can reduce
cholesterol and help prevent heart disease.

   For the some who like it hot, there are now more than 300 brands
of Mexican hot sauce available in the United States.
   If you're from Los Angeles, that sauce probably is salsa. For
Texans, it's most likely picante sauce. Easterners often choose taco
sauce.
   These saucy tidbits come from Rod Sands, vice president of sales
and marketing for Pace Foods, who says that sale of Mexican sauces
reached $271 million in 1987, more than double the figure of 1980.
   About 30 percent of all Mexican food eaten in the United States
is consumed in Californian, he says, followed by Texas, Arizona and
Washington state.
   Most popular is picante sauce, which accounts for 40 percent of
the market, according to Find-SVP, a New York market research firm.
Picante is a thin sauce with pieces of jalapenos, tomatoes and
onions.
   Second is salsa, a thicker sauce often made with milder green or
anaheim chilis, followed by taco sauce, usually flavored with red or
cayenne pepper, and the gravy-like enchilada sauce.

   A more casual alternative to a holiday formal dinner party is the
dessert buffet, with coffees and cognac.
   Some suggestions:
   Plan to serve three to four desserts for 10 to 15 guests, four to
five desserts for a group of 20 or 25.
   Mix mugs with coffee cups and pull out the extra plates from the
cupboard.
   A tray of three or four varieties of cognac, French brandy, eases
the need for an elaborate bar setup.
   Another idea is to add alcohol to the hot coffee and top it with
whipped cream and garnish.
   For cafe Italiano, add an ounce of amaretto; for Dublin coffee,
an ounce of Irish Mist; Caribbean coffee calls for an ounce of
Kahlua and half-an-ounce of rum, and Kioki coffee is made with an
ounce of Kahlua and an ounce of brandy.

   Supermarket produce counters are taking on a
special look these days, with bean sprouts, bok choy, guava and
other exotic items catching the eye of food shoppers, says an
Agriculture Department economist.
   ``Specialty fruit and vegetable displays form a fundamental part
of the new up-scale image of many produce sections,'' says Catherine
Greene of the department's Economic Research Service.
   Rising demand for specialty produce is in line with a general
increase in fruit and vegetable consumption, she says. On the
average, Americans consumed 427 pounds of fruits and vegetables last
year, up 12 percent since 1972. That is a farm weight equivalent
before trimming, processing and after-harvest losses, she says.
   Greene, writing in the agency's National Food Review, said there
are a number of reasons.
   ``Americans have become more health conscious, eating lots of
fruits and vegetables as part of a well-balanced diet,'' she said.
``Consequently, we want a huge selection of produce.''
   Further, Americans travel more frequently than they used to, and
many want ``foreign'' foods when they return home.
   ``Unusual fruits and vegetables are appearing on restaurant
menus,'' Greene said. ``Also influencing our diets are recent
immigrants from the Caribbean, Central America and Southeast Asia
who have brought their native foods with them.''
   A survey conducted for a trade journal, The Packer, showed the
most frequently tried specialty fresh vegetables were alfalfa and
bean sprouts, followed by snow peas, pearl onions, parsnips, leeks,
baby vegetables, Chinese cabbage and shallots.
   Moreover, about a third of those surveyed also had seen or heard
of less widely known specialty vegetables such as Belgian endive,
bok choy, celeriac, daikon, kohlrabi, parsley root and Jerusalem
artichoke.
   The most frequently tried specialty fresh fruits, in order, were
pomegranates, persimmons, kumquats, quince and guavas.
   Additionally, at least a third of those surveyed had seen or
heard of breadfuit, passion fruit, plantains, prickly pear and red
bananas. But some fruits were nearly unkown: Asian pears,
carambolas, cherimoyas, sapotes, radiccho and rappini.

   The Four Seasons, the handsome hangout of the
rich and powerful, has edged longtime leader Lutece as New Yorkers'
favorite restaurant, according to the 1989 Zagat Survey.
   The elegant walnut-paneled restaurant in the Seagram Building
garnered the most points when the Zagat Survey asked some 3,500
respondents to list their five favorite restaurants.
   Lutece, the classic French restaurant that had ruled Zagat's
roost for 10 years, slipped to second, followed by La Cote Basque,
Le Bernardin and Chanterelle.
   But that's the popularity contest, with The Four Seasons getting
about 300 more mentions than the smaller Lutece.
   ``It's a combination _ the great architecture of Philip Johnson,
it's the most professionally run restaurant I know of, and the food
is really good,'' said Tim Zagat, editor of the survey, about The
Four Seasons.
   As for the former king, ``Lutece is still a fantastic restaurant,
but it has competition,'' he said.
   ``Also, people's expectations of Lutece are so unbelievably high
that there is a certain amount of disappointment, especially when
you have to make a reservation 30 days in advance.''
   When it comes to food rankings, Chanterelle and Lutece were in a
virtual tie, followed by La Cote Basque, Le Bernardin and Lafayette.
The Four Seasons ranked ninth.
   For decor, the winner is a newcomer of sorts _ the refurbished
Rainbow Room atop the RCA Building, which survey participants rated
slightly ahead of Windows on the World, Tavern on the Green and
World Yacht Enterprises, a restaurant on a yacht on the Hudson River.

   California's 650 wineries account for about 70 percent of annual
sales and 90 percent of wine production in the United Sttes.
   California started the five-year wine cooler boom, and as the
market went flat, consumers of that white-wine-and-fruit-juice blend
moved up to white wine alone, then the more complex white zinfandel.
   The premium boom was on.
   California's success encouraged winegrape growing far and wide in

   It was started in San Francisco by Dave and Linda Shank, both 39,

   When Dave Jr. was 1 year old, his mother decided to return to
work as a flight attendant. Knowing she would be gone for week-long
stretches, Mrs. Shank left her husband armed with homemade
casseroles divided into small containers or margarine tubs for
storage in the freezer.
   ``With a microwave, it was really a godsend,'' Shank recalled.
   Among the Growing Gourmet meals for toddlers: chicken vegetable
rice, beef vegetable barley and turkey vegetable pastina. The
packages of two 5.5-ounce servings sell from $2.39 to $2.69.

<HEAD>Dollar Edges Up Against Yen, Share Prices Continue Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar inched up against the Japanese yen
today in cautious trading following last week's concerted central
bank interventions, while share prices continued to rise on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 122.52 yen, up 0.12 yen from Friday's close
of 122.40 yen. Opening at 122.40 yen, the currency moved within a
tight range of 122.37 yen to 122.60 yen.
   ``The dollar-yen rate didn't move very much today mainly because
market players have become extremely cautious after the intervention
by world's major central banks Thursday and Friday,'' said a dealer
with Mitsubishi Bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Investors were selling the dollar less, but very few people
were interested in buying the currency,'' he said, adding that it
was not dollar-buying interest that saved the dollar from falling
further but cautiousness over the central bank intervention.
   Dealers said the Bank of Japan did not intervene today.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 103.39 points to
close at a record high of 29,180.20 Friday, added 104.06 points or
0.36 percent to finish at a new record of 29,284.26. The Nikkei rose
119.00 points shortly after the market opened, and managed to
maintain the gain, rising for the seventh straight session since
Nov. 11.
   ``Financial issues attracted participants largely because of the
yen's strength against the dollar,'' said a dealer with Nomura
Securities, Japan's largest brokerage. ``But on the other hand, many
market players were quite afraid that share prices were getting too
high,'' the dealer said, asking he not be identified.
   In moderate trading, volume was estimated at 850 million shares.

   The dollar was mixed and trading in a narrow range
in Europe today, with the fear of central bank intervention
dampening business, foreign currency dealers said. Gold prices were
little changed.
   Traders in Italy said the market remains bearish about the
dollar's near-term propects. But they said the market also appears
determined to send President-elect George Bush a clear warning that
something must be done quickly to cut the U.S. trade deficit and
federal government spending.
   ``The market doesn't want to wait until Jan. 20,'' when Bush is
inaugurated, said one trader in Milan.
   Most of the world's major central banks bought dollars in several
rounds of coordinated interventions Thursday and Friday, halting a
rapid decline in the U.S. currency.
   ``The interventions of the past days have boosted the dollar only
temporarily, but caution is still recommended,'' said the chief
dealer at a Frankfurt bank.
   ``If one believes that the dollar will weaken, the central banks
are likely to come in again.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.12 yen to a closing 122.52. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 122.50 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.7362 West German marks, up from 1.7360; 1.4585

<HEAD>New Federal Flight Limits Threaten To Add To Holiday Delays</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Getting over the river and through the woods to
the family Thanksgiving feast via O'Hare International Airport _
always a challenge _ may be even tougher this year because of new
federal flight limits.
   And things don't look much better for Christmas, say travel
agents, airline and aviation officials.
   ``We're routinely advising our customers and clients of the,
let's say, congestion problems at major airports, particularly
O'Hare,'' said David Powell, American Express Travel Service vice
president.
   The new Federal Aviation Administration limits on the number of
flights allowed to arrive at O'Hare in a given hour are likely to
aggravate the problem at the nation's busiest airport.
   Following a startling 150 percent increase in the number of
errors by air traffic controllers at O'Hare this year, the FAA in
October ordered the airport to cut the number of arrivals from 96
per hour to 80 per hour between peak-travel times of 4:45 p.m. and
9:15 p.m.
   While the cutbacks, called a ``flow control program,'' were
designed to make skies safer, airlines acknowledge they also have
increased tardiness in a system in which delays never were uncommon.
   ``We have seen a definite impact from the flow control program,''
said spokesman Tom Stack of American Airlines, the second-largest
carrier at O'Hare.
   ``To give some example, in October of 1987 at O'Hare we were
above 95 percent in our arrivals within 15 minutes. That dropped to
about 75 percent in October of this year.''
   Airlines also no longer have a reserve of planes to help
accommodate heavy holiday traffic, said United Airlines spokesman
Joe Hopkins.
   While the number of flights over the holiday won't be up much _
about 2,300 total arrivals and departures per day _ the number of
people in the skies will be, as airlines see their planes filled to
capacity.
   Stack anticipates that sometime over the four-day Thanksgiving
weekend, American will top its previous one-day record of more than
30,000 passengers flown out of O'Hare.
   ``Passengers ought to look forward to having some delays,'' both
in the air and on the ground, he said, adding that Sunday may be
worst of all. ``People can choose a variety of days to begin
vacation, but pretty much they wind up returning on that Sunday.''
   Assuming clear skies, the airlines said travelers should find the
delays manageable, but if the weather declines to cooperate,
everything is up for grabs.
   ``Sixty percent of your delays are related to weather,'' said FAA
spokesman Mort Edelstein in Chicago.
   The new FAA limitations were imposed after the number of
controller errors reached 30, far exceeding the 12 reported at
O'Hare in all of 1987. Four of the errors occurred over a period of
a week, Edelstein said.
   Even with the new limits, ``there's no perfect flow control,''
Edelstein said. ``Some hours we'll take 82 (arrivals per hour). We
are liberal with the 80 an hour when it has to be.''
   Some feel the cutbacks don't go far enough.
   ``The airlines schedule so many fights at certain times in and
out ... that the airport can't handle them,'' said David Shuler, a
controller at O'Hare and a representative of the National Air
Traffic Control Association. ``There's only so many taxiways the
aircraft can be on.''
   Shuler said the long-term solution is 30 more controllers at
O'Hare.
   The short-term answer for travelers?
   ``Avoid key peak times and don't put off travel plans till the
last minute,'' said Powell of American Express.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Severe economic problems
aggravated by the costs of apartheid are causing a spread of hunger,
disease and unemployment in South Africa, a prominent research
organization reports.
   The South African Institute of Race Relations, an independent
group with a reputation for impartial research, said in its annual
survey on Sunday that ``the effects of economic decline pervade the
picture of South African society.''
   Housing experts estimate that 7 million of the nation's 26
million blacks live in shacks, the report said.
   It quoted the National Tuberculosis Association as reporting that
the disease, although preventable, was killing 10 people a day.
   The institute cited a university study forecasting that South
Africa could have a surplus of 9 million unskilled workers without
jobs by the year 2000 unless the economy is revitalized.
   Unemployment estimates among blacks range from 20 percent to 50
percent, though reliable figures are not available.
   ``Economic problems continue to be exacerbated by expenditure on
segregated structures, and by the government's failure to meet black
political demands,'' the report said.
   It referred to a recent speech by President P.W. Botha in which
he said the government's plans to eliminate inequalities in social
services were being disrupted by foreign sanctions and embargoes in
protest of apartheid, under which the black majority has no voice in
national affairs.
   Botha said the ``campaign of economic war being waged against
us'' could deprive the government of $400 million for social
programs over the next five years and delay their implementation by
10 to 15 years.
   The race relations institute cited estimates that the government
wasted $400 million each year operating racially segregated health
services.
   Government health officials reported widespread malnutrition
problems, and Operation Hunger, a private group, said it was feeding
1.2 million South Africans a day, according to the institute's
report.
   The report said economic problems had sidetracked a longstanding
government promise to equalize per-pupil spending at black and white
schools. This initiative has been stalled because the country's
annual economic growth rate is now 2.5 percent, instead of the
projected 4.1 percent rate on which the plan was based, the report
said.
   Of government spending on education, 41 percent went to white
schools, although only 11 percent of the students were white, the
report said. It said the government acknowledged that white school
facilities were underutilized but was reluctant to let them be used
to alleviate serious overcrowding in black schools.
   The government says it is committed to tax reform, deregulation,
privatization and social improvements for blacks. But it is not
willing to remove the budgetary duplication created by segregated
schools and hospitals and by the country's 13 separate
administrations, divided into white, mixed-race, Asian and 10 black
homelands.
   South Africans also are feeling the harsh effects of economic
measures taken by the government to counter the 13.3 percent annual
inflation.
   The measures include higher tariffs for imported luxury goods.
   In addition, the country faces a foreign debt that is expected to
reach almost $12 billion in 1990-91 and is equivalent to about half
its export earnings.
   In another development Sunday, newspapers reported that the three
main white, anti-apartheid political parties will launch a unified
party on Dec. 14 to challenge Botha's National Party.
   The merger would involve the Progressive Federal Party, led by
corporate executive Zach de Beer; the New Democratic Party, led by
National Party defector Wynand Malan; and the Independent Party, led
by the former ambassador to Britain, Denis Worrall.

   The older television grows, the more juvenile it
becomes.
   Delirious in a fact-based fever, TV sets are boiling over with
playground pranks and True Detective docudramas. From Geraldo
Rivera's scuffle with wanna-be Nazis to the slow-mo misdeeds on
``America's Most Wanted,'' television has rarely been so revolting
and so riveting at the same time.
   The new splurge of reality programming has critics shaking their
heads and viewers crowding living room sofas. And as long as the
ratings soar, a whole lot more truth-is-stranger-than-fiction series
will be hurtling your way.
   Which is why reality champion Fox Broadcasting Co. is riding high.
   ``I do think we're on to something,'' said Barry Diller, Fox's
chairman and chief executive officer. ```The Reporters' is not a
carbon copy of anything else. ... And I think `America's Most
Wanted' is an honestly moving show.''
   In fact, these shows owe a lot to previous programs: ``The
Reporters'' can be seen as merely ``60 Minutes'' on a caffeine jag,
the crime shows as simply borrowing from the headlines more directly
than did ``Hill Street Blues'' or ``St. Elsewhere.''
   Imitators are lining up. NBC has added ``Unsolved Mysteries'' to
its schedule, CBS started ``High Risk'' and ABC has resurrected
``That's Incredible'' and added the trilogy of ``Scandals,''
``Crimes of the Century'' and ``Trackdown.''
   Meanwhile, television syndicators are pounding the pavement for
``On Trial'' ``Group One Medical,'' ``Tabloid,'' ``Exclusive,''
``Crimewatch Tonight,'' ``Crime Diaries,'' ``$Reward$'' and ``Inside
Edition.''
   The popularity springs from a cast of characters more varied and
bizarre than any sitcom.
   In one corner are the hyperactive talk-show hosts _ Rivera with
his broken nose and the cluster-bomb of Phil Donahue, Oprah Winfrey
and Sally Jessy Raphael with all of their needling queries. These
four ask the questions we only dream about posing.
   The other corner is filled with the marginally less egotistical
``journalists'' who would recreate the John Kennedy assassination if
there were a rating point in it.
   Led by Maury Povich on Fox's syndicated ``A Current Affair'' and
its rape and murder replay show, ``America's Most Wanted,'' the key
here is to sit the audience down next to the corpse, smack in the
middle of the crime scene.
   Wherever reality programs fail in subtlety and substance, they
click in thrills and ratings. Costing a fraction of traditional
comedies and dramas, these unpredictable programs have in some
instances doubled Fox's audience share _ 15 percent of the nation's
sets tune in ``America's Most Wanted.''
   Overall, the audience is clearly substantial: Rivera, nose broken
but self-importance intact, is soaring from publicity generated from
his talk-show brawl and his NBC hit ``Devil Worship: Exposing
Satan's Underground.''
   Rivera, the carnival barker of television journalism, even went
so far as to slap a promotional teaser on the slugfest edition of
``Geraldo'': ``Parents, be advised that the language and violence
contained makes this show inappropriate for small children.'' In
other words, kids, watch this!
   Why are audiences lapping it up?
   ``American television viewers are tired of watching the most
inoffensive programming,'' said Kevin Wendle, executive vice
president of Fox's entertainment division. ``They have said, `We
don't want another network. Give us something different.' And we're
pulling out all the stops.''
   And how. Mixing sometimes sensational celebrity gossip and lurid
crime stories with first-person journalism, ``The Reporters''
doesn't just penetrate the ``fourth wall,'' it runs through it into
your home.
   Future Fox shows may be even more personal. Among ideas in the
hopper for Fox's third night of programming (planned for Mondays
sometime next year) is ``Cops,'' a graphic documentary series about
a group of Florida police officers making arrests and handling dead
bodies.
   Another Fox program in development will try to build on detective
magazines, with private eyes talking up their most interesting cases
with the help of video recreations.
   ``They (Fox) have shown that there's an insatiable thirst for
real life among the television viewing audience,'' said Rivera.
``They are filling a void that the networks are leaving. ... I think
that `America's Most Wanted' has really hit a nerve. It's populist
TV at its most pragmatic.''
   So much flotsam clogs the reality genre that some players are now
trying to rise above it all.
   Nick Clooney, host of the courtroom highlight show ``On Trial,''
recently sent reporters a letter saying, ``By some unimaginable
stretch of probabilities, a few writers equate such programs as
`Geraldo' and `Morton Downey Jr.' with `On Trial.' Nothing could be
further from the truth!'' The letter was mailed one day after an
``On Trial'' publicist asked that the show be included in any
upcoming stories on tabloid television.
   As with most anything else, too much of a good thing can be
risky. If the reality-based programming crumples overnight, so, too,
might Fox.
   ``While it's great now, we'll be careful,'' Diller said. ``If
we're not very careful about the diet, we'll make terrible
mistakes.''

<HEAD>Saudi Arabia Seeking Bigger Involvement in Oil Products Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia is seeking more
involvement in refining and marketing oil products as a buffer
against swings in crude oil prices, according to Oil Minister Hisham
Nazer.
   In an interview on state-run television, Nazer said the Saudi oil
industry wants to compete in United States, European and Japanese
markets through joint ventures with foreign oil concerns.
   Analysts have said other OPEC countries also are looking for
similar ``downstream'' ventures to help offset the
counter-cyclicality of production and refining. Falling crude prices
have been a boon to many U.S. refiners, while hurting production
operations.
   The Saudi Arabian National Oil Company, which runs the kingdom's
oil industry, recently launched a joint venture with Texaco Inc. to
refine and market petroleum in the United States.
   ``The American market is big and there is still more to it, while
there is the very big market in Japan and Europe and Far East, and
we as processors of oil must storm these markets and... guarantee
marketing outlets for Saudi crude oil,'' Nazer said in the
interview, broadcast Sunday.
   Nazer also mentioned plans for similar deals in European and
Japanese markets, noting that prices of refined products remain
steady despite fluctuating crude prices.
   ``In case the price of crude oil drops, the income would be
compensated somewhat through preserving the price levels of refined
products,'' he said.
   Declining oil prices since 1982 have meant six straight years of
budget deficits in Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer among the 13
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Saudi Arabia has the
world's largest oil reserves.
   The current world oil glut has forced prices down to about $13 a
barrel, well below the OPEC benchmark price of $18.
   Nazer said the kingdom's oil development strategy ``would be
lacking if it did not comprise all stages of the industry starting
from the wellhead and ending with the gasoline station.''
   The Texaco deal gave the kingdom a 50 percent stake in three
Texaco refineries and nearly 12,000 service stations in the United
States. It was the first major Saudi attempt to guarantee outlets
for its crude oil.
   Nazer said in the television interview that the deal guaranteed
sales of 600,000 barrels per day. Saudi Arabia's current OPEC
production quota is 4.34 million barrels per day.
   Revamping the Saudi oil industry also includes measures to
improve profits at the state-run refining and marketing company
Petrofin, Nazer said. Petrofin controls all but one of the kingdom's
six oil refineries, operates three lubricants plants and distributes
and exports refined products.
   Petrofin also controls exploration and development of non-oil
mineral resources such as bauxite, the raw material for aluminum,
and gold.
   ``The aim is to convert all of Petrofin's tasks to profit centers
that bring additional revenue to the state and then to reduce the
expenditure costs in Petromin,'' Nazer said. He said savings of 500
million riyals ($133 million) already have been made.

   Grand Metropolitan PLC announced today it
has again extended its $60-a-share all-cash tender offer for the
Pillsbury Co.
   Unless extended again, the offer is now set to expire at midnight
EST Friday, Nov. 25. The offer was to have expired at midnight last
Friday.
   Grand Met now says more than 72 million shares of Pillsbury
common stock, representing about 84.6 percent of outstanding shares,
have been tendered and not withdrawn.
   Grand Met, a British conglomerate, launched a $5.23 billion
takeover bid for Pillsbury last month. The board of the
Minneapolis-based restaurant and food company has urged rejection of
the offer.
   Larry Haeg, director of public relations for Pillsbury, said
today the company has no comment on Grand Met's fourth extension of
the offer.

<HEAD>Tobacco: Marketing Officials Optimistic As Burley Season Opens</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ Despite a third straight year of
drought, officials say the burley tobacco going to market today will
be larger and higher in quality than last year's crop.
   The market opens this week in North Carolina and seven other
states, and marketing officials are cautiously predicting that
farmers will have a better selling season this year than last year.
   ``I think the price average will be up, but that will mainly be
because of the higher quality,'' said Joey Coleman, who operates the
two tobacco warehouses in Boone with his father.
   Last year, North Carolina burley prices averaged $150.87 per
hundred pounds, down from the previous season's average of $156.01.
   This season's federal price support average will be $1.50 a
pound, up by slightly more than 1 cent. By grades, the support will
range from 98 cents to $1.63, the same as last season.
   ``It's looking a lot better than it did in July before the rains
came,'' said Ed French of the Federal-State Market News Service in
Lexington, Ky.
   A larger crop is expected this year because of more planted
acreage and slightly higher yields, he said.
   The Nov. 1 crop survey estimates the crop at 538.9 million pounds
for the eight-state burley belt, up from last year's 486.6 million
pounds. Yields are projected at 2,043 pounds an acre, up from 1,943
pounds last year.
   North Carolina's burley crop is expected to total 15.3 million
pounds, up from 14.1 million last year. Yields are projected at
1,800 pounds an acre, slightly more than last year's 1,785 pounds.
   Kentucky produces more than half the total crop. Burley tobacco
is also grown in Virginia, Tennessee, West Virginia, Indiana, Ohio
and Missouri.
   French said it would be difficult to estimate whether demand for
the burley crop would be as strong as for this year's flue-cured
tobacco crop.
   ``Everyone seems to be optimistic,'' he said. But, he added, such
optimism can fade quickly if farmers are disappointed with prices on
opening day.
   Mary Jo Hicks, who is operating both tobacco warehouses in West
Jefferson this season, said she is encouraged by the favorable
comments from government graders and a couple of buyers who watched
farmers bring in tobacco last week.
   ``They are looking at it as a very desirable crop,'' she said.
   In North Carolina, sales will open today at markets in West
Jefferson and Asheville, with the Boone market beginning sales
Tuesday.

   Stock prices slumped today amid persistent
worries about the dollar and interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.91 to 2,050.50
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 241 up, 513
down and 398 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 15.86 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   After falling sharply since the election early this month, the
dollar steadied late last week as central banks of the
industrialized countries intervened to support it.
   But analysts said many investors remained skeptical that the
dollar would be able to continue strengthening on its own.
   At the same time, brokers said, many participants were taking a
gloomy view of the market outlook, in part because of the
competitive allure of short-term interest-bearing investments
sporting yields of close to 8 percent.
   Intel tumbled 3{ to 19| in the over-the-counter market. Late
Friday the company said its revenues and earnings for the fourth
quarter would fall short of third-quarter levels because of soft
orders for its 80386 microprocessor chip.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .75 to 149.43. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .19 at 286.86.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.96 to 2,062.41,
trimming its loss for the week to 4.62 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 840 up, 536 down and 555 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 119.32 million shares, against 141.28
million in the previous session.

<TEXT>
   LTV Corp., which filed for Chapter 11 protection
from creditors in July 1986, plans to ask a U.S. Bankruptcy Court to
grant an eighth extension to give it time to work out a
reorganization proposal, company officials said.
   In response to the proposed request, LTV creditors have told the
court they reject the company's reorganization plan and will agree
to only one more extension, Joel Zweibel, attorney representing bank
creditors of the aerospace division, told the Dallas Times Herald.
   Attorneys for creditors of the parent company declined to comment.
   LTV faces a growing number of dissenting creditors who claim its
original proposal for settlement is unacceptable or are unhappy with
the length of negotiations.
   Aerospace creditors on Thursday renewed protests to LTV's Nov. 7
request for extension and asked the court for the right to present a
separate reorganization proposal.
   ``The talks are totally stalled. There is no progress, no
movement at all,'' said Zweibel.
   LTV has argued it needs time to work out the complex case, which
involves some 32,000 creditors of the aerospace and steel
conglomerate.
   LTV has ``made very substantial progress,'' said spokesman Chuck
Palmer. ``You would hardly expect 32,000 claims to be resolved in
such a short time.''
   Officials said the extension requestion could come today.

<HEAD>Lawyers' Association Seeks Halt to Ad Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyers' association has asked Colorado Insurance
Commissioner John Kezer to put a stop to an Aetna Life & Casulty
advertising campaign on lawsuit abuse, contending that it misleads
the public.
   The Colorado Trial Lawyers Association, a trade group for lawyers
who handle personal injury lawsuits, contends that many of the
problems mentioned in Aetna's ads were resolved through the state's
1986 ``tort reform'' law, which sets limits on damages in personal
injury lawsuits.
   Kezer said he is still weighing the issue of misrepresentation
versus Aetna's First Amendment right to speak out on issues. ``It's
not just black and white,'' he said.
   Aetna's campaign, ongoing in Denver, St. Louis, Rochester, N.Y.,
and New Orleans, highlights what the Connecticut-based company
claims is a growing abuse of the nation's court system by people
trying to make money via lawsuits.
   The ads complain that abusive lawsuits are costing insurance
companies too much money and that the public is paying for it
through higher insurance rates. They ask concerned parties to call a
toll-free number.
   Lance Sears, president of the lawyers' association, said the 1986
Colorado law made important changes aimed at ending frivolous suits
and other abuses in the state's civil justice system.
   Bob Caruthers, Aetna's director of corporate communications, said
the company wants to make people as aware of lawsuit abuse ``as they
are of littering and drunken driving.''
   He said the ad campaign is different from the sort of campaign
waged in 1986 when the state's tort reform was passed. At that time,
he said, Aetna was trying to reach business leaders and elected
officials.
   Now, he said, the company is taking its case to the people.
   In some cases, tort reform and other civil statutes are being
challenged, which is one reason for the campaign, he said.
   The company is planning to expand the $800,000 test market to a
nationwide newspaper-and-radio advertising campaign.

26 this week to 923, rebounding from a sharp plunge in the previous
week, industry watcher Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   The increase continues to reflect an unstable trend in the rig
count, which last week dropped by 45 to total 897.
   A year ago the count was 1,152, Baker Hughes said Monday.
   The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity
and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of
last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.
   Among major oil producing states, Louisiana posted the biggest
gain with 16 additional rigs, followed by Oklahoma, 10; North
Dakota, two; and California, Colorado and Ohio, one each.
   Michigan had the biggest decline with 3 fewer rigs, followed by
Kansas, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wyoming, with two each. Texas
was unchanged for the week.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's economy will grow for the
seventh straight year in 1989, despite a federal budget deficit that
will swell to $170 billion, according to a Bank of America study
released on Monday.
   The bank's 1989 U.S. Economic Outlook said there will be no
recession, even though economic growth will slow to 2.7 percent from
1988's 3.8 percent.
   ``The annual growth rate, however, masks weaknesses in the
economy, which will become evident in the last half of 1989,'' said
John Wilson, the bank's chief economist.
   After a strong growth rate in the first quarter, the result of
bouncing back from the 1988 drought, ``economic growth will slow to
under 2 percent for the remainder of the year,'' the study said.
   ``The most serious economic policy challenge that the Bush
administration will face is the federal budget deficit, even though
both the politicians and the general public are suffering from
battle fatigue on this issue,'' said Wilson.
   Inflation will increase to 4.9 percent from 4.1 percent in 1988
while the unemployment rate will be around 5.5 percent next year.
   Wage gains are expected to increase an average of 4.3 percent
compared to 3.3 percent, the forecast said. As a result, consumer
prices will be 0.7 of a percentage point higher in 1989 due to wage
pressures.

   President-elect George Bush insisted today that
``I'm not going to change my view'' on how to keep the deficit down,
despite a congressional report saying his proposed ``flexible
freeze'' on spending won't solve the problem of the federal
government's burgeoning red ink.
   ``I'm under no illusions about the simplicity of all of this. I'm
determined to get that budget deficit down ... (but) I can't get
discouraged every time somebody comes out with yet another report,''
Bush said at a news conference announcing three personnel
appointments, including that of Richard Darman, a former White House
aide and deputy Treasury secretary, as budget director.
   A report over the weekend by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, concluded that a spending freeze
alone would not fix the deficit, which stood at $150 billion in the
budget year that ended Sept. 30.
   The report said that tax increases and cuts in defense and Social
Security must be considered to slash the budget deficit and for the
new administration to have ``any flexibility to pursue its own
policy agenda'' and for the economy to regain its vigor.
   Specifically, the report, said the United States ``cannot
`freeze' our way out of the problem.'' During his presidential
campaign, Bush repeateldy rejected higher taxes and advocted a
``flexible freeze'' on spending.
   Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa., chairman of the House Budget Committee
said earlier today on ``CBS This Morning'' that Bush will probably
have to reassess his economic assumptions once he gets into office
and will ``submit his own budget, which will reflect the new
realities.''
   Bush said today he would indeed ``sit down with my budget
director and go into exactly where we stand on all these numbers.''
But, he added, ``I don't think there's been any dramatic change in
the figures we've been dealing with. The GAO seems to come out with
reports periodically, but I will be persuaded much more by what my
budget director tells me is the reality than by their reports.''
   ``I'm open minded in terms of hearing from all these people ...
but I'm not going to change my view as to how we get this deficit
down,'' Bush said. ``I spelled out a program ... (that was) endorsed
by the American people. I don't remember any Republicans or
Democrats running on a please-raise-my-taxes program,'' he said.
   Gray, who is leaving the Budget Committee chairmanship in the new
Congress, said the Democratic leadership will support Bush if he
comes up with a plan to meet his stated priorities of reducing the
deficit without new taxes while preserving national defense and
important programs like Social Security, education, clean air, and
the anti-drug effrt.
   ``The question is making sure we have the right numbers and the
right kind of assumptions,'' Gray said.

   Negotiations between the Chicago Sun-Times and its
unionized editorial employees resumed this morning, hours before a
threatened walkout by the writers, editors, photographers and
support staff.
   A strike deadline of 2:30 p.m. CST today was set by the
negotiating committee of Chicago Newspaper Guild Local 71, though
the deadline could be changed, said Daniel Lehman, the newspaper's
religion writer and a union spokesman.
   Talks resumed at 9 a.m., said Sun-Times spokesman Michael Soll.
   But he added that ``at this time, it looks like 2:30 would be as
far as we can go.''
   Soll said newspaper negotiators were willing to meet around the
clock, and that he hoped the talks would be fruitful.
   ``There appears to be much less anguish and much more hope''
among negotiators on both sides, he said. Salary remained the main
sticking point.
   The Sun-Times' negotiators ``have not yet made their final
offer,'' Soll said, adding he expected that offer to be made at
today's meeting.
   Union leaders met late Sunday night and agreed to accept the
company proposal for a bargaining session today.
   ``We'll keep negotiating until we have a settlement or until we
hit the strike deadline, and then we're out of there,'' said Shane
Gericke, a copy editor and member of the negotiating committee for
the union, which represents 250 reporters, editors, photographers
and support staff.
   ``We decided to give it every shot,'' he said.
   A strike by Sun-Times editorial workers would be the first in the
newspaper's 40-year history.
   Soll said management did not want a strike, but is ``fully
prepared to produce a paper'' using company executives, non-union
editors and outside writers.
   He said the newspaper would continue putting out its three daily
editions.
   Union members have been working without a contract since June 1.
   As the strike deadline approached, guild unit chairman Thomas
Gibbons said the union would walk out if the company continued to
refuse to offer a pay raise.
   The guild has been seeking a 19.5 percent pay raise over three
years, while management's latest proposal was for a 3 percent salary
cut for 18 months, followed by a restoration of current pay levels
for the remainder of the three-year pact, Gibbons said.
   ``We've got to have pay raises in the contract for this to be
settled,'' he said.
   In addition, Gibbons said, differences remained over management
proposals to cut night differential for workers by 40 percent and
exempt eight senior editorial staffers from union jurisdiction.
   Soll said ``the paper is healthy financially'' but must control
its costs to remain competitive with the larger Chicago Tribune,
which has an estimated circulation of 765,000 daily and 1.117
million Sunday.
   The Sun-Times, whose circulation is estimated at 605,000 daily
and 614,000 on Sunday, was purchased from Australian media baron
Rupert Murdoch for $145 million in June 1986 by a group of investors
led by the New York investment firm Adler & Shaykin.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans were mixed
early in today's session on the Chicago Board of Trade in light,
pre-Thanksgiving trading.
   ``We might already be entering a holiday-type market: thin trade,
quiet markets, light volume,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Most soybean futures were fractionally higher on technical
factors but reports of weekend rain in the soybean regions of
Argentina and Brazil were keeping a rein on the rally, analysts said.
   Grain prices were mostly lower with little fresh news to pull
prices one way or the other.

<HEAD>Thailand Seeks to Turn Indochina Battlefields into Marketplaces</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOLLY YONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a dozen years after communist
victories in Indochina, Thailand is hoping to turn its adversaries
next door into trading partners and battlefields into lucrative
marketplaces.
   Calling for increased commerce with Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia,
Thai businessmen see potential in markets shunned by their hardline
government.
   As Vietnam liberalizes its underdeveloped economy, Thai
businessmen and some legislators worry that if they act too slowly,
others will corner a market Thailand is in a favorable geographic
position to penetrate.
   Japan and Singapore already ply those markets, each drawing about
$300 million a year in a low profile but brisk trade. Among other
competitors in the region are Hong Kong, Taiwan and France.
   Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan, himself a businessman,
started talking about improving general relations with Indochina as
well as exploring economic opportunities shortly after taking office
last August. ``Battlefields into marketplaces,'' has become one of
the slogans of the new government.
   Thai businessmen are angling for fishing licenses in rich
Vietnamese waters and sending agricultural experts to Laos to
supervise an experimental farm while importing timber from that
country.
   Laotians shop at a Thai-run department store in the heart of the
capital of Vientiane and a Thai company recently entered into the
first major joint venture investment project in Laos, the
construction of a garment factory.
   But officially Thailand has thus far had no
government-to-government economic transactions with Vietnam since
Hanoi's troops invaded neighboring Cambodia, and Thai policy has
been one of putting pressure on Hanoi in all fields.
   The Thai government also offers no help to private entrepreneurs
doing business with Indochina, but generally turns a blind eye to
the vast black market trade across its borders with Cambodia and
Laos as well as Burma.
   ``We have lost time and lost out to countries that actively
traded with Indochina regardless of their government's strong
opposition to Vietnamese troops in Cambodia,'' said Wongse
Polnikorn, a onetime deputy foreign minister and currently chairman
of a Thai company that will import timber from Laos and set up a
cash crop farm in Vientiane.
   Chatichai decreed that the number of goods officially banned for
export to Laos be halved to 30 in advance of his recent visit to
Laos, the first by a Thai prime minister since 1979, government
spokesman Suvit Yodmani said.
   Since the 1975 communist victory, periodic skirmishes _ as well
as two major confrontations _ have erupted along the Thai-Laotian
border. Similar clashes have occurred between Thais and Vietnamese
along the Thai-Cambodian frontier.
   Last year, two-way trade between Laos and Thailand topped $48
million although the black market, or ``unofficial,'' trade is known
to be far higher. Two-way trade with Vietnam rose to $7.5 million
last year from $4.8 million in 1986, while Thai exports to Cambodia
were $400,000 in 1986.
   Suvit said Chatichai's moves toward Vietnam were a ``trial
balloon'' to induce Hanoi to focus on improving its economy rather
than making war.
   But some in Thailand, which has traditionally been suspicious of
Hanoi's long-term intentions in the region, view a prosperous
Vietnam as potentially dangerous and expansionist.
   ``If we can make Vietnam prosperous, ourselves prosperous, that's
great, but what is there to guarantee that Vietnam won't move into
Thailand's northeast,'' Suvit said in an interview. ``Once it's
prosperous, then it can afford to keep troops in Cambodia.''
   Surin Pitsuwan, a respected member of Parliament, said Thailand
should at first proceed cautiously in trade with Laos, a country
with which it shares ethnic and cultural bonds and which poses no
major security threat. He also suggested more economic dealings with
Burma, with which official, two-way trade totaled $544 million in
1987.
   ``There are a lot of trade opportunities and untapped resources
next door,'' Surin said. ``If we don't hurry now, the degree of
their dependence on us will be reduced.''
   Although Thailand will be hard pressed to compete with Japanese
technology and funding involved in major projects, businessmen say
the Thais could carve out a profitable Indochina niche in areas like
fishing, forestry and smaller-scale construction.
   Thailand, with its economy booming and consumer spending on an
upward curve, could also serve as a market for Indochinese goods.
While war and mismanagement have eroded the economic infrastructure
in Indochina, the three countries possess large untapped natural
resources and an abundance of cheap labor.
   ``We must go and explore ways we can do more and benefit from one
another,'' said Kangwan Tantiponganant, a businessmen involved in
Laos.
   Given the political sensitivities, other Thai businessmen prefer
to make low-keyed trips to Hanoi and Vientiane, emphasizing that
their interests are in ``long-term business planning.''

<HEAD>Carrying A Company's Documents Means Cheap Flights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Need a cheap ticket to Rio?
   Are you willing to dress well for the trip, shun alcohol on the
flight and do a little light delivery work?
   If so, you may be ready for a fast-paced career as an overseas
air courier.
   For up to 70 percent off the cost of a regular airline ticket,
couriers shuttle business documents and small parcels from the
United States to foreign lands and back. It's all perfectly legal.
   For example, flying to Rio de Janiero on a commercial flight from
Boston costs over $1,000, depending on the season. But Now Voyager,
a New York air courier booking agent, had an Election Day flight for
$150 round-trip from New York. The round-trip cost of a shuttle
flight to New York from Boston would add $198.
   ``Being a courier is very simple,'' said air courier guru Kenneth
Clarke, who has taken about 20 international flights as a courier
and writes a monthly newsletter on the subject. ``You don't have to
do anything. You just have to be there.''
   Clarke, 36, an Australian who has lived in New York City for 13
years, said he was working as a ground courier four years ago when
``somebody told me it was possible to fly back on the Concorde for
250 bucks. Two weeks later I was in London and I did it.''
   About 20 courier companies, most based in New York and Los
Angeles, are battling in what has developed in the last five years
into a highly competitive business.
   ``When this industry started if you could offer three-day service
(companies) just about knelt down and kissed your feet,'' said Toni
Carpenter, overseas director of I.B.C. Pacific, a Los Angeles
courier company. ``Next year, I'm expecting them to demand yesterday
service.''
   Couriering began in the mid-1970s, but the need for speedy
international business deliveries to New York, London, Hong Kong,
Milan or Paris didn't surge until the beginning of this decade. Many
companies in the past either hired private couriers or sent their
own employees _ more expensive and time-consuming than using
``civilian'' couriers, who pay to fly rather than getting paid.
   ``Getting things on someone's desk by 10 o'clock tomorrow morning
became very important in business,'' said Michelle Rosen of Now
Voyager in New York. ``If you ship something by freight it can take
as long as 72 hours to clear customs and is consigned to a freight
terminal.''
   Banks, stock brokerage houses, insurance companies, film studios
_ all use air couriers regularly, typically shipping bundles of
documents and bulky materials. Under a signed contract, couriers
aren't responsible for the contents of their packages and typically
don't even touch them.
   Couriers normally pay a fee to a service _ Now Voyager charges
$45 _ and then say when and where they want to travel, booking up to
three months in advance for regular, scheduled departures and return
trips on commercial airlines.
   Payment is the bargain ticket, usually 30 percent to 70 percent
off regular fares.
   Couriers travel to the airport with the courier company, which
checks the baggage and hands over the baggage claim receipts and, on
international flights, a manifest listing contents.
   The courier meets another agent at the destination, and either
hands over the receipts or brings the material _ packed in canvas
bags bearing the courier company logo _ through customs and is free
to go until the return, also usually a courier trip.
   So what's the catch?
   Couriers are permitted only a carry-on bag. Drinking alcohol is
not permitted on board and couriers have to dress well. And they
have to be flexible in terms of booking; most couriers are
``freelance whatevers,'' self-employed, retired, teachers or
students _ but it's not impossible to schedule vacations around
courier flights.
   Some companies are wholesalers, meaning they ship freight on
contract from other couriers, usually to points not served by those
couriers. For instance, Federal Express may hire another courier to
get a package to an overseas point.
   Most courier trips made by civilians are international _ some 85
percent on Now Voyager _ because major domestic courier companies
provide their own overnight service within the United States.
   Clarke's October newsletter listed about 100 available flights
from New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Miami _
including a $499 round-trip ticke to Hong Kong and $75 round-trip to
Bermuda. Round-trip European destinations come as cheap as $150 to
Amsterdam.
   Clarke started an air courier company that folded, and now
lectures on being a courier at ``adult education'' schools like
Boston's ``Learning Adventure,'' which offers classes on cooking,
hang-gliding and ``How To Find A Lover.''
   ``For all adventurous readers, Now Voyager has just introduced
Guatemala as a destination,'' Clarke writes in his typewritten
``Travel Secrets,'' in which he lists available courier flights by
company and even proffers vacation tips.
   ``At $250 round-trip it's a bargain, and seven days is enough
time to take a side trip to the spectacular Mayan ruins at Tikal.''

   RJR Nabisco Inc.'s stock surged in heavy trading
today after directors extended the record-sized auction for the
company and disclosed they had received one tentative offer possibly
more than $26 billion.
   The staggering takeover maneuvers for the food-and-tobacco giant
grew even more complex Sunday when a special committee of directors
evaluating offers said it was postponing the deadline for bidders
until Nov. 29.
   The committee also disclosed that the bids received as of the
first deadline last Friday not only topped all previous bids, which
were in the unprecedented $90-a-share or $20 billion range, but that
all were worth at least $94 a share or about $21.3 billion. The
committee said one group had estimated its offer as possibly worth
up to $118 a share or $26.6 billion.
   It further stated all previous bidders could resubmit offers,
strongly suggesting the committee wasn't satisfied with proposals
received so far. The committee also told its own advisers to
consider other types of restructuring.
   ``...while no assurance can be given that any transaction will
occur, the Special Committee expressed its belief that that process
which it is overseeing will benefit all shareholders,'' stated
Charles Hugel, RJR Nabisco's chairman and the head of the
five-member special committee.
   RJR's stock jumped $2.37{ to $86.37{ on the New York Stock
Exchange, where it was the most heavily traded stock of the morning
with more than 1.44 million shares changing owners.
   Jostling for approval now are these proposals:
   _A $100-a-share cash and securities offer valued at about $22.5
billion from a group led by RJR Nabisco senior management and the
investment firms Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon Brothers
Inc. That group, which last month touched off the buyout battle with
a proposed takeover, previously offered $92 a share, or about $20.7
billion, for RJR's 225.3 million common shares outstanding.
   _A $94-a-share cash and securities offer, with an indicated value
of about $21.2 billion by a group led by buyout specialist Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co., which previously offered $90 a share, or about
$20.3 billion.
   _A preliminary cash and securities proposal to sell RJR's food
businesses and later acquire its tobacco business separately, from a
group led by the investment firm First Boston Corp. and a
partnership that includes Chicago's Pritzker family and Denver
billionaire Philip Anschutz. First Boston indicated it valued the
total consideration at from $105 to $118 a share.
   All three proposals would include a minority equity stake in the
post-buyout company for current RJR shareholders.
   ``Due to the varying potential values and nature of the
consideration offered in the two bids and the proposal, and the
varying terms, conditions and contingencies associated with each,
the Special Committee determined not to make any recommendation at
this time'' Hugel stated.
   Atlanta-based RJR makes hundreds of consumer items ranging from
Jose Cuervo tequila and Salem cigarettes to Life Savers candy and
Milk Bone dog snacks.
   Any of the latest proposals easily would be the biggest U.S.
merger ever, topping the record $13.4 billion acquisition of Gulf
Oil Corp. by what is now Chevron Corp. in 1984.
   It was not immediately clear whether the bidders were ready to
escalate the already tense takeover fight.
   Kohlberg Kravis stated its group ``must carefully consider our
alternatives in light of new information we will be receiving before
reaching any judgment on what further steps, if any, we might take.''
   F. Ross Johnson, RJR's chief executive and the leader of the
management group, said he believed his group had submitted ``a
winning bid,'' but gave no indication whether its proposal was
subject to revision.
   There was no comment from the First Boston-led group.
   The management group offered $100 a share in cash for for 175
million of the company's 225.3 million outstanding common shares.
The group said it would acquire the remaining shares for $56 cash,
plus securities and common stock in the surviving company that it
said would bring the total consideration to $100 a share. The common
stock would equal about 15 percent of the surviving company's
outstanding shares.
   The new Kohlberg Kravis proposal would pay $94 cash a share for
about 178 million RJR Nabisco shares. The remaining stock would be
exchanged for preferred stock and securities the firm valued at $94
a share, including convertible debentures that, assuming full
conversion into stock, would amount to about 25 percent of the
post-buyout company's outstanding shares.
   The Kohlberg and management group's offers are for a leveraged
buyout, in which most of the money for the purchase of RJR Nabisco
would be borrowed and later repaid with the comapny's cash flow or
the sale of its assets.
   The First Boston group's preliminary proposal includes the
installment sale by Dec. 31 of RJR's food businesses _ which
accounted for about 60 percent of net sales last year, or $15.8
billion _ followed by the acquisition next year of the tobacco
operations.
   The plan anticipates a purchase of the RJR tobacco business for
$15.75 billion plus the stock warrants, and the sale of the food
businesses for a $13 billion installment note plus the right to 80
percent of the total net proceeds from the sale of food businesses
that exceeded the amount of the note.
   Proceeds from the sale of the food operations, which analysts
have estimated could total $12.5 billion to $15.5 billion, would go
to shareholders. First Boston indicated the total consideration
could range from $98 to $110 cash a share, plus securities and stock
warrants firm valued at from $7 to $8 a share. The warrants would
entitle RJR shareholders to acquire up to 20 percent of the tobacco
business.

<HEAD>Defense Contractor May be Liable for Another $40 Million in
Overcharges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sundstrand Corp. has warned its
shareholders to brace for almost $40 million more in fines, on top
of $127 million the company is already paying for defrauding the
government on military contracts.
   ``The government is continuing to pursue claims of approximately
$39.2 million of misallocated costs plus interest,'' Sundstrand said
in a recent third-quarter report to shareholders.
   The Rockford-based company is awaiting ``determination letters''
on other government contract disputes, besides those related to the
$39.2 million, the company said. Those letters are the government's
formal notification that the contractor owes it money.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said today that the additional fines
mentioned in Sundstrand's third-quarter report apparently involve
civil issues that were not resolved by settlement of criminal
charges and ``that we did not believe at the time warranted criminal
prosecution.''
   Valukas said the government and the company were negotiating a
settlement of those issues. He would not comment further.
   The $39.2 million is nearly twice the $20 million Sundstrand has
left in its special account to resolve disputes involving military
and other government contracts.
   Company spokesman Claude Vernam said Friday he knows of no plans
to put more money into the fund.
   However, investment analysts said the company probably would have
to take an additional charge on earnings if Sundstrand has to repay
the entire amount.
   ``It sure seems like it,'' said Mitch Quain, an analyst with
Wertheim Schroder in New York.
   Steve Colbert, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Research, said:
``They have on the table less than $20 million. The government wants
$40 million plus. There's no telling right now what it's going to
be.''
   Sundstrand has pleaded guilty in Rockford to four counts of
criminal fraud. It also pleaded guilty in Seattle to mischarging on
government contracts. The company was fined $115 million for the
Illinois crimes and $12.3 million for activities of its Sundstrand
Data Control operation in Seattle.
   The fines were the largest ever paid for government contract
fraud.
   A federal grand jury is continuing to look into possible criminal
charges against company employees.

   Considering how tight your local banker seems to
be when you approach him for a loan, there is a bit of a mystery why
so many billions of dollars in loans have gone astray.
   A few items underscore the mystery of how so many ``experts'' in
finance could have made so many financial blunders on large loans
while riding herd on tiny ones.
   Consider these developments in the banking arena:
   _Some of the country's most prestigious banks are in the process
of writing down hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to less
developed nations that may never be repaid.
   Some banks already have collapsed. During 1987, more than 200
insured banks were closed or kept open only with emergency aid at a
cost to the Federal Desposit Insurance Corp. of about $2.1 billion.
   That figure may not depict the true situation. At the end of 1987
close to 1,600 insured banks were on the problem list, nearly four
times the number at the end of 1982, when the economy was emerging
into a long expansion.
   _The World Bank recently won congressional approval of a $14
billion authorization, the better to make loans to less developed
nations that are unable to handle their existing loans to commercial
banks.
   _The cost of restructuring the savings and loan industry's
finances, ruined by bad loans, could eventually cost taxpayers
between $20 billion and $100 billion, since the taxpayers are the
insurers of such loans.
   _The President's Commission on Privatization reported earlier
this year that the delinquency rate on federal loans was 8 percent,
or three times that on private loans. It said the delinquency
amounts to $24 billion.
   In just one area, the Guaranteed Student Loan Program, the
commission estimated that defaults will reach about $12 billion by
1990. ``There is broad agreement that federal lending agencies have
been ineffective as loan managers,'' the panel said.
   It could have been said also about private sector lenders.
   The status of loans, public and private, strains credibility _
and things are not improving. The latest craze is for lenders to
toss billions of dollars at corporate raiders of some of America's
biggest companies.
   Is the new debt secure? Have the loan officers scrutinized the
applicants? Are they exercizing their obligations to protect the
depositors, whose money it is? If they lose the money will it be
necessary for Uncle Sam to rescue them?
   Somehow, critics are saying, a sense of responsibility and
accountability seems to have been lost. Too often, they say, the
costs of the bad loans are borne by the public, in taxes, rather
than by the culprits, in their wallets.
   Why this should be so is debatable, but federal insurance
programs may have something to do with it. The ability to juggle the
books _ that is, maintain as an asset a loan everyone knows will not
be collected _ may be another reason.
   But no answer whatever is likely to satisfy the small borrower
with an unblemished credit record who has to mortgage the house in
order to get a loan to repair the roof. To him, and others, the
mystery cannot be penetrated.

<HEAD>EEC Commissioner Calls for Joint Merger Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community's competition
commissioner said Monday it was essential that the 12 EEC states
forge a joint merger control policy.
   ``National laws are simply not adequate to deal with cross-border
mergers, in particular those which may have an effect upon the
Community as a whole,'' Commissioner Peter Sutherland said in a
speech.
   Last week, EEC states agreed to empower the EEC Commission to
consider corporate mergers in advance, and maybe block them.
   But the Commission is seeking the power to rule on mergers
exceeding a billion European currency units, which are worth about
$1.19 billion, in annual revenue. Britain, France and West Germany
want that limit raised.
   Urging speedy adoption of a merger control policy, Sutherland
said differing national rules on mergers which may lead to
conflicting decisions.
   ``This is a severe handicap for the companies concerned who are
entitled to expect greater legal certainty and more rapid
procedures,'' he said.
   He said companies increasingly view the EEC countries as ``their
home market. It is now widely acknowledged that if the economic
objectives underpinning the single market strategy are to be
achieved, a streamlined Community merger control mechanism must be
available.''
   Sutherland spoke at a conference organized by the London daily
Financial Times on EEC's plans to knock down trade barriers among
its member nations by Dec. 31, 1992.
   He said while the EEC members adopted a modest airline
deregulation plan in 1987, ``we have to go further.'' He said the
Commission has begun drafting proposals for a second stage of
liberalization.
   These will deal with ending curbs on capacity and prices and
freeing air carriers of the system of slot allocation at airports
that now favors major airlines at the expense of smaller
competitors, Sutherland said.
   He said the Commission also planned to tackle air transportation
agreements between EEC nations and other countries.
   ``There is now a good case for the negotiation of air service
agreements between the Community and other nations ... The present
network of bilateral agreements has resulted in an unduly rigid
international air transport system,'' he said.

   Share prices slid Monday on the London Stock
Exchange as market makers slashed prices in a fruitless bid to
attract buyers.
   The Financial Times index of 100 leading shares finished down
12.3 points, or 0.67 percent, at 1,811.1. The narrower Financial
Times 30-share index was off 8.9 points at 1480.1.
   Volume fell to 359.4 million shares from 567.3 million shares
Friday.
   Dealers cited a decline in the dollar as one reason traders were
wary about committing new funds to the market.
   ``There's a tremulous feeling that no one wants to commit a drop
of funds to this market with the latent uncertainty out there,
especially from the U.S.,'' one dealer said.
   Analysts said the market lacked direction because participants
were sitting out the session in anticipation of this week's U.S.
Thanksgiving holiday and Friday's release of British trade data for
October.
   The Financial Times 500 share index fell 6.43 to 1,031.71.

   The stock market showed a broad loss today amid
persistent worries about the dollar and interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 13.51 to 2,048.90
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 385 up, 1,077 down
and 431 unchanged.
   After falling sharply since the election early this month, the
dollar steadied late last week as central banks of the
industrialized countries intervened to support it.
   But analysts said many investors remained skeptical that the
dollar would be able to continue strengthening on its own. Indeed,
it fell today against leading foreign currencies.
   At the same time, brokers said, many participants were taking a
gloomy view of the market outlook, in part because of the
competitive allure of short-term interest-bearing investments
sporting yields of close to 8 percent.
   RJR Nabisco climbed 1~ to 85~. Directors extended until Nov. 29
the bidding competition to acquire the company.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 1 at 114{; Exxon, down } at 41]; General Electric,
down { at 43], and American Telephone & Telegraph, down [ at 27{.
   Intel tumbled 3{ to 19| in the over-the-counter market. Late
Friday the company said its revenues and earnings for the fourth
quarter would fall short of third-quarter levels because of soft
orders for its 80386 microprocessor chip.
   Other semiconductor issues followed Intel lower. Motorola dropped
1[ to 36] and National Semiconductor was down [ at 8].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
1.11 to 149.07. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell against all major currencies
in European trading Monday amid continued anxiety about the American
budget deficit. Gold prices declined.
   Currency dealers said the dollar was hurt by remarks from
President-elect George Bush reaffirming that he won't raise taxes to
narrow the huge gap. At issue is whether Bush and the
Democratic-controlled U.S. Congress can agree on spending cuts
needed to trim the deficit.
   Dealers also reported a lack of central-bank intervention Monday
to prop up the dollar's exchange rate as there had been last week.
One trader said the dollar cannot maintain its current exchange
rates without central bank buying.
   The Canadian dollar gained more than two cents in London against
the U.S. dollar on the heels of Saturday's opinion polls predicting
victory in Monday's Canadian general election for Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney's Conservatives.
   In London late Monday, one British pound cost $1.8175, more
expensive for buyers than Friday's late $1.8160.
   Other late rates compared with late rates Friday: 1.7305 West
German marks, down from 1.7360; 1.4575 Swiss francs, down from
1.4585; 5.9305 French francs, down from 5.9340; 1.9550 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.9610; 1,288.62 Italian lire, down from
1,293.75; and 1.2117 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2343.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begains, the dollar closed at 122.52 Japanese yen, up from 122.40
late Friday. But in late London trading the dollar fell lower to
122.20 yen.
   Gold bullion closed in London, the major European market, at
$416.75 a troy ounce, down from $417.75 bid late Friday. The late
price in Zurich was $416.50 an ounce, down from $417.80.
   Gold closed in Hong Kong at $418.79 an ounce, down from $419.12.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $6.04 a troy ounce,

<HEAD>Japan Steelmaker Buying Part of Armco Steel Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armco Inc. and a major Japanese
steelmaker Monday announced their intention to form a joint venture
to operate Armco's Eastern Steel Division.
   Robert Boni, Armco's chairman and chief executive officer, said
Armco and Kawasaki Steel Corp. reached agreement in principle to
form the venture to jointly manage and operate the Middletown-based
Eastern Steel Division, which includes Armco's steel mills in
Middletown and in Ashland, Ky.
   The division employs 13,800 people, has annual sales of about
$1.5 billion and annual production capacity of approximately 3.5
million tons of steel.
   The proposed terms of the joint venture provide for Kawasaki to
purchase 40 percent of Armco's Eastern Steel Division for about $350
million with Armco retaining the rest.
   Language in the agreement allows for the two companies to
negotiate an increase in Kawasaki's investment in the venture up to
a maximum of 50 percent, officials said.
   The proposed venture would assume the debts and employee benefit
obligations related to the division's operation.
   Boni said the joint venture would provide new steelmaking
technology for Armco's carbon steel business, would give the
Japanese steelmaker a stake in a major U.S. steel company and would
allow the two firms to better serve Japanese automakers in the
United States.
   ``We are enthusiastic about the prospects for this venture
because it would allow us to add some of the world's best new
technology to our already announced plans to modernize and improve
our two largest flat-rolled carbon steel plants,'' Boni said in a
statement.
   The modernization plan includes quality and productivity
improvements at both Middletown and Ashland. Eastern Steel makes a
broad range of carbon flat-rolled steels for the automotive,
appliance and construction markets.
   Boni said the proposed joint venture is part of Armco's long-term
growth strategy. He said, ``The product and technology fit between
the two companies will provide a foundation for growth that will
strengthen Armco, benefit Kawasaki and, most importantly, better
serve all our customers.''
   No date was projected for completion of the agreement, but Armco
officials said the two firms will complete negotiations and sign a
formal agreement as soon as possible. The contract is subject to
approval by the boards of directors of both companies.
   Armco, which maintains corporate headquarters in Parsippany,
N.J., produces carbon, electrical and stainless steels, steel
products and oilfield machinery and equipment and is in the property
and casualty insurance business.
   Kawasaki is the third largest steel producer in Japan. Like
Armco, it is a world leader in the technology of carbon and coated
steels. The company, with about 27,000 employees, has two major
steel plants in Japan and a modern research center with some 1,300
scientists and technicians. The firm has also recently diversified
into semi-conductors, telecommunications, advanced materials and
high performance ceramics.
   The firm also is part-owner of California Steel Industries Inc.,
based in Los Angeles. Kawasaki had 1986 sales totaling about $6.4
billion.

<HEAD>Low Pay Hampers IRS Efforts, Study Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In some areas of the country, the people who
process your federal tax return are paid less than those who make
your hamburgers, congressional auditors said Monday.
   The problem of low salaries was one of several cited by the
General Accounting Office in a report on how the IRS might improve
the tax-collection process. The report was one of a series by GAO,
an arm of Congress, on major problems to be faced by the new
president and new Congress.
   ``If these issues are not addressed,'' GAO boss Charles A.
Bowsher wrote, ``the (IRS) commissioner can expect (1) serious
problems in processing tax returns, (2) a decline in taxpayer
confidence in the tax system, and (3) a significant loss in tax
revenues that could help reduce the deficit.''
   The most pressing IRS need is modernization of the tax-processing
system, GAO said, noting the agency already has approved a basic
plan that will cost several billion dollars and is expected to take
10 years to complete.
   ``IRS cannot afford to wait until the mid-1990s for a solution to
an impending computer capacity problem,'' GAO said. ``If it does,
the processing problems encountered in 1985 in processing tax
returns and issuing refunds could reoccur.''
   Most recommendations in the report had been made previously by
the GAO. They include:
   _Creating an agencywide plan aimed at improving IRS employees'
ability to work effectively in an increasingly automated
environment. Low pay is a major problem.
   ``In some geographic areas, returns processing staff in the
service centers are paid less than employees of local fast-food
restaurants,'' the report said. ``IRS faces the same dilemma in
trying to recruit revenue agents.''
   It said that while the IRS cannot match the big salaries offered
by some private employers, ``IRS could improve its competitive
position through more modern and sophisticated recruiting.''
   _Better employee training. A 1987 survey found that 57 percent of
IRS employees believed their training was inadequate. Half of a
sample of letters sent to taxpayers were incorrect or unclear. And
IRS workers gave the wrong answer 36 percent of the time to
telephone callers who asked for advice earlier this year.
   _The IRS must pay more attention to the problem of tax
delinquencies that now total $56 billion. The agency estimates that
$33 billion of that is collectible. ``Little has been done to
determine why tax delinquencies occur,'' GAO said.
   _Cutting the growing tax gap _ taxes owed but not paid _ must be
a top priority. The 1988 gap was estimated at $87.1 billion; the
figure is projected to hit $114 billion by 1992. GAO called for more
audits _ fewer than 2 percent of returns are audited. The report
also urged a new program that would match corporate tax returns with
backup income documents, in the same way that individual returns
already are compared with reports of wages, interest and dividends
earned.

   Soybean futures prices rebounded Monday in
afternoon trading to close sharply higher on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Corn finished mostly higher while wheat prices fell.
   The turnaround in soybean prices followed steep daily declines in
that market in six of the seven previous trading sessions. Monday's
rally was due largely to profit-taking by speculators who had sold
contracts in earlier sessions in hopes of buying them back at lower
prices, analysts said.
   ``The markets were oversold, overdone, overdue for a rally and it
finally came today in all the pits except wheat,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   The soybean market led the rally but wheat did not participate
because of disappointment over the failure so far of U.S. and Soviet
negotiators to work out a new long-term grain sales agreement, he
said.
   At the close, wheat was \ cent to 3 cents lower with the contract
for delivery in December at $4.08 a bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower
to 3 cents higher with December at $2.61\ a bushel; oats were 2{
cents to 5{ cents higher with December at $2.06 a bushel; soybeans
were { cent to 15 cents higher with January at $7.46 a bushel.

   The stock market turned in a mixed showing today
amid persistent worries about the dollar and interest rates.
   Blue-chip stocks rallied late in the day to recoup their early
losses, but the rest of the market lagged behind.
   After falling sharply since the election early this month, the
dollar steadied late last week as central banks of the
industrialized countries intervened to support it.
   Analysts said many investors remained skeptical, however, that
the dollar would be able to continue strengthening on its own.
Indeed, it fell today against leading foreign currencies.
   At the same time, brokers said, many participants were taking a
gloomy view of the market outlook, in part because of the
competitive allure of short-term interest-bearing investments
sporting yields of close to 8 percent.

   Crude oil prices edged higher Monday in light
trading as the oil market awaited news on the prospects for a new
OPEC production agreement.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for January
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, rose
7 cents from Friday's close to settle at $12.98 per 42-gallon barrel.
   Among refined products, the December contract for heating oil
gained 0.71 cent to 43.47 cents a gallon, while the December
contract for unleaded gasoline lost 1.33 cents to 44.32 cents a
gallon.
   Traders attributed the drop in gasoline prices to the end of a
10-day-old refinery strike in Brazil.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries opened formal
talks in Vienna, Austria, aimed at setting new production quotas for
its 13 members. The talks were adjourned after 90 minutes to allow
private negotiations to continue among key members who are trying to
work out a nagging dispute between Iran and Iraq.
   One of the main obstacles to a new agreement has been Iraq's
insistence on a production ceiling equal to Iran's. Traders said
they expected the market to move cautiously until that dispute is
somehow resolved or other measures are approved by the cartel to
rein in production.
   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman opened the winter meeting of the
cartel by appealing for compromise. He said members must reach a new
accord limiting their oil production or risk a ``serious erosion''
of crude prices.

   OPEC ministers quickly adjourned their
formal talks Monday and resumed private negotiations aimed at
resolving a dispute between Iran and Iraq that is holding up a new
production agreement.
   The ministers met for about 90 minutes before putting off their
formal talks until Wednesday.
   President Rilwanu Lukman opened the winter meeting of the
13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries by appealing
for compromise. He said cartel members must reach a new accord
limiting their oil production or risk a ``serious erosion'' of crude
prices.
   ``It may be necessary to take one step back now from our
deep-seated principles and beliefs in order to take two steps
forward at a later date,'' he said.
   He said the cartel's problems ``are formidable and yet they are
not insuperable.''
   Crude oil prices edged higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange
in light trading as the market awaited definitive news on the
progress of the talks. Contracts for January delivery of West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, rose 7 cents from Friday's
close to settle at $12.98 cents per 42-gallon barrel.
   Lukman said they had not yet discussed the crucial questions of
oil production, output quotas for member countries and pricing.
   A few hours after the meeting, the ministers resumed some of the
private discussions they have been holding since late last week to
try to resolve the issues separating Iran and Iraq.
   The main obstacle has been Iraq's insistence on a production
ceiling equal to Iran.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh met with his Algerian
counterpart, Sadek Boussena, who appears to have become an emissary
between Iran and Persian Gulf countries.
   After the meeting, Aghazadeh told reporters it was still too
early to tell whether an agreement would be reached or not.
Consultations, he said, will continue Tuesday.
   ``If we should (see) some proposal that is good, we accept,'' he
said.
   The ministers want to work out a new arrangement giving each
country a production quota. They want to include Iraq in the system.
Iraq refused to join in the current accord arranged in 1986.
   ``I would be happier if I was inside the agreement,'' said Iraqi
Oil Minister Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi.
   Aghazadeh again said he would oppose quota parity with Iraq. The
two countries have had different ceilings for some time, he said.
   Saudia Arabia and Kuwait have said they will not join a new quota
system unless all 13 members belong.
   The ministers want to use the new accord to cap their runaway
production and lift weak prices. OPEC maintains a benchmark price of
$18 a barrel but prices have been well under that.
   Lukman told the ministers, ``As we are all aware, prices have
been hovering $5 to $6 per barrel below our targeted levels for
several months now.''
   ``If we do not reach such an accord,'' he said, ``then I am
afraid we may see a further serious erosion of these price levels,
to our mutual detriment.''
   Aghazadeh said he has offered to meet with Iraq, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to work out the quota dispute.
   ``We can sit down to solve (the) problem (and have a) discussion
about any matter,'' he said. ``I am very flexible.''
   He also said Iran wants OPEC to give it a higher ceiling in any
new agreement. Iran needs more revenues from its oil to help rebuild
after the 8-year war with Iraq.
   He said Iran will be able within a year to boost its production
of oil to more than 4 million barrels a day. The country, he said,
is currently pumping more than 3 million barrels a day and will
boost that to about 3.3 million in a few months.
   Under the current production agreement, Iran has a ceiling of 2.4
million barrels a day. Iraq, although it refused to join the current
accord, has an allotment of 1.5 million barrels a day.
   Analysts estimate that Iraq has been producing at least 2.6
million barrels a day, an amount that could soar to 3.7 million
barrels in mid-1989 with completion of a new pipeline through Saudi
Arabia to the Red Sea.
   OPEC's current output accord sets total production at about 15
million barrels a day for 12 countries.
   Total cartel production in October was estimated by the
International Energy Agency at nearly 21.1 million barrels, the
highest monthly level in more than five years.
   Aghazadeh has proposed that Iraq be given ``export parity'' with
Iran. That would allow Iran to have a higher overall ceiling to
account for its larger internal oil demand, which it estimates at 1
million barrels a day.
   A possibility for resolving the dispute, analysts suggested,
would be to give Iraq a lower quota on paper. But the difference in
the ceilings would be made up by letting Iraq keep a portion of the
oil produced in an area called the neutral zone, which is shared by
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
   The discussions began Thursday evening when the two OPEC
committees _ price evolution and long-term strategy _ held formal
talks.
   Countries belonging to those panels are Indonesia, Saudi Arabia,
Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Indonesia, Kuwait and Venezuela.
   Other members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar and the United
Arab Emirates.

<HEAD>Report Says Regions Dependent On Manufacturing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manufacturing jobs are growing faster in
traditional service-sector areas and declining throughout the
once-booming rust-belt states, according to a new report Monday by
the Conference Board.
   California, North Carolina and Florida are among the
beneficiaries of a new geographical realignment of manufacturing,
the report by the business-financed research organization said.
   Meanwhile, manufacturing job growth is continuing to decline in
states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania, once the guts of the
U.S. industrial heartland.
   ``Employment gains in the manufacturing sector this year will
spread more widely than ever across the United States,'' says Steven
R. Malin, a specialist in economic trends. ``Before the next
national recession, Southeastern and Western states will have added
substantially more manufacturing jobs than states in the North and
East.''
   Seven major states have added more than 738,000 manufacturing
jobs since 1982, the report said. California was in the lead with
228,900, followed by Michigan with 114,500. In the last two years,
however, Michigan has lost 66,000 manufacturing jobs, the board said.
   Also gaining manufacturing jobs since 1982 were North Carolina
91,400; Florida 90,600; Indiana 78,600; Georgia 78,300; and
Minnesota 55,400.
   Among the losers were West Virginia with 7,300 jobs lost since
1982; Connecticut 29,500; Massachusetts 34,700; New Jersey 43,300;
Pennsylvania 52,000; Ohio 63,700; and New York 88,900.
   The Conference Board said the key to manufacturing success next
year will be construction, defense spending and exports.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls On Bush Remarks About Deficit; Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar weakened Monday against major foreign
currencies in the absence of central-bank buying.
   Gold prices also declined. Republic National Bank quoted bullion
at $415.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down $1.25 from late
Friday.
   The dollar had strengthened in Tokyo but turned lower in Europe
after remarks from President-elect Bush reaffirming that he won't
raise taxes to narrow the huge federal budget deficit.
   ``It's been a slow decline all day,'' said Ronald H. Holzer,
chief currency dealer for Harris Trust & Co. in Chicago.
   Renewed worries about the U.S. trade and federal budget deficits
have pushed the dollar sharply lower in recent weeks, prompting
central banks around the world to buy dollars on Thursday and Friday
to prop up the currency's value.
   But Holzer and other dealers reported a lack of central-bank
intervention Monday.
   ``The absence of internvention today allowed the dollar to ...
fall; that, and the remarks from Bush,'' Holzer said.
   At issue is whether Bush and the Democratic-controlled U.S.
Congress can agree on spending cuts needed to trim the budget
deficit. If left unchecked, dealers fear, it ultimately will hurt
the U.S. economy.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 122.52 Japanese yen, up from 122.40 yen late
Friday. But in late London trading the dollar fell lower to 122.20
yen, and in New York it fell to 122.025 yen, down from 122.60 late
Friday.
   The British pound cost $1.8175 in London, more expensive for
buyers than Friday's late $1.8160. Later, in New York, sterling
fetched $1.8235, down from $1.8155 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.72815 West German marks, down from 1.7370; 1.45495 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4600; 1.20695 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2300; 5.9070 French francs, down from 5.9365; and 1,284.575
Italian lire, down from 1,292.00.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday, included
: 1.7305 West German marks, down from 1.7360; 1.4575 Swiss francs,
down from 1.4585; 5.9305 French francs, down from 5.9340; 1.9550
Dutch guilders, down from 1.9610; 1,288.62 Italian lire, down from
1,293.75; and 1.2117 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2343.
   The Canadian dollar gained more than two cents in European and
domesitc trading against the dollar on the heels of Saturday's
opinion polls predicting victory in Monday's Canadian general
election for Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservatives.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
fell to $415.80 a troy ounce from $417.40 late Friday.
   Gold bullion closed in London at $416.75 an ounce, down from
$417.75 bid late Friday. The late price in Zurich, Switzerland, was
$416.50 an ounce, down from $417.80.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $418.79 an ounce, down from
$419.12.
   Silver prices also declined. On the New York Comex, silver fell
to $6.010 a troy ounce from $6.08 Friday. Bullion traded late in
London at a bid $6.04 a an ounce, down from $6.09.

<HEAD>Federal Probe of Blinder-Robinson Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal probe of a penny-stock brokerage firm's
records continued Monday as government spokesmen declined comment on
what the investigation was seeking.
   ``I'm afraid no one can make any comment,'' said assistant U.S.
Attorney Howard Zlotnick in Las Vegas, Nev., where the current probe
of Denver-based Blinder, Robinson & Co. originated.
   However, Steven B. Theyes, Blinder, Robinson's senior vice
president, on Monday said the search warrant was directed at records
of 53 investors ``none of whom are present or former officers,
directors, stockbrokers, or agents of Blinder, Robinson'' and 16
publicly traded issues ``none of which were underwritten by Blinder,
Robinson.''
   ``It's their privilege to claim anything they want,'' was
Zlotnik's reply.
   Earlier, Blinder, Robinson lawyers said documents which agents
for the Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Treasury were looking for
had been given to the Securities and Exchange Commission months ago.
   ``We are conducting business,'' Theyes said Monday. He noted,
however, that business is being conducted at about 40 percent of
normal strength, in view of an agreement reached before a U.S.
District Court judge in Denver between the company and agents
continuing their probe within the firm's offices.
   Theyes said he had about 60 staffers working Monday compared with
a normal force of about 150.
   Theyes said he hoped the search of files would wind up Monday
night. He said 24 Treasury agents launched the probe with a federal
search warrant Saturday morning and that by midday Monday, the
agents had confined their efforts to records in storage rooms.
   The brokerage firm has 66 offices in 37 states nationwide and
posted 1987 revenue of about $130 million. It specializes in penny
stocks, which are cheap, high-risk securities not usually traded on
major stock exchanges.
   Blinder, Robinson has been the subject of earlier federal
investigations involving allegations of fraud, markups and
misrepresentation.
   Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission launched a
probe of Blinder, Robinson, alleging that customers had been
defrauded.
   The SEC also had two other actions pending against the company,
which was the nation's largest penny-stock broker. Those allegations
accused the company of bookkeeping violations.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers levied penalties
of $250,000 against the company in 1987 for charging excessive
markups in the price of shares for one of its issues.
   The company was suspended from doing business for five days and
six executives were suspended from the brokerage business for 90
days.

   The stock market turned in a sluggish, indecisive
showing Monday in a session dominated by persistent worries about
the dollar and interest rates.
   Blue-chip stocks rallied late in the day to recoup their early
losses, but the rest of the market lagged behind.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 20 points at
its midsesssion low, closed with a 3.56 gain at 2,065.97.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
565 up, 930 down and 477 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 120.43 million
shares, against 119.32 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 142.03 million shares.
   After falling sharply since the election early this month, the

   Also dampening activity was the expectation of an uneventful week
broken up by the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. The market will
be open on Friday, but the session after Thanksgiving is almost
always one of the slowest of the year.
   RJR Nabisco climbed 1~ to 85~ and led the most-active list among
NYSE issues on turnover of more than 3.7 million shares. Directors

   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $2.80 billion, or 0.11
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks dipped

<HEAD>Drexel Asks for Rehearing on Judge Disqualification</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. requested a new
hearing Monday in its attempt to oust the judge presiding over the
federal civil-fraud case facing the Wall Street investment firm.
   In a 15-page petition to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
attorneys for Drexel and other defendants asked a three-judge panel
that had rejected their earlier request to rehear the matter, refer
it to the entire 12-judge appellate bench or allow a separate
hearing before another lower court judge.
   Last week, the three-judge panel ruled 2-1 that Drexel's effort
to disqualify U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack from the case on
grounds of conflict of interest was unwarranted.
   The defendants had argued that Pollack's wife, Moselle, stands to
gain at least $30 million from the sale of her stock in Palais Royal
Inc., a Houston-based retailer going private in a transaction Drexel
is helping finance.
   Drexel's lawyers said the indirect relationship between Drexel
and Pollack's family created the appearance of bias and required
Pollack to disqualify himself.
   Pollack, an 82-year-old jurist known for tough rulings in
white-collar fraud cases, has denounced Drexel's maneuvering to oust
him as a nonsensical ploy. He has said his wife's business affairs
have nothing to do with Drexel.
   Some lawyers familiar with the Drexel case have said they
believed the defense maneuvering is part of a broader strategy to
get a more lenient judge.
   It was unclear how the 2nd Circuit would respond to Drexel's
request for a rehearing on Pollack. Such requests are seldom granted.
   Drexel is facing numerous civil charges leveled by the Securities
and Exchange Commission in September that the firm conspired with
now-imprisoned speculator Ivan Boesky to trade on inside
information, manipulate stock and commit other frauds. The firm has
denied the accusations.
   In addition, a federal grand jury has been considering whether to
indict Drexel and some key employees on criminal charges. There has
been persistent speculation that the charges could be announced soon.

   Cocoa futures prices surged Monday on New York's Coffee, Sugar &
Cocoa Exchange on fresh rumors that the Ivory Coast and France had
reached an agreement to withhold large amounts of Ivorian cocoa from
the world market.
   On other exchanges, precious-metals futures fell again; grains
and soybeans were mostly higher; livestock and meat were mostly
lower; oil futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Official word of a long-anticipated Ivorian cocoa withholding
scheme appeared imminent Monday afternoon after a senior delegate to
the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) reportedly said parties
had agreed on the framework for the deal.
   Cocoa settled $30 to $48 higher with the contract for delivery in
December at $1,425 a metric ton.
   But cocoa market analyst Arthur Stevenson of Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. cautioned that rumors of an Ivorian-Franco
withholding scheme had been running rampant in the market and that
nothing had been formally announced.
   ``That's been the situation that we've heard every day now for
two weeks, yet nothing changes,'' Stevenson said. ``Apparently
something is in the works but I can only tell you it has not been
confirmed by the French government.''
   Under terms of a deal reported by Knight-Ridder Financial News,
200,000 metric tons of Ivorian cocoa would be stored in Europe;
100,000 metric tons would be sold to the Soviet Union and 100,000
metric tons would be sold to the Paris-based trade house Sucre et
Denrees for gradual release onto the market.
   The total of 400,000 metric tons would represent more than half
of the cocoa crop currently being harvested in the Ivory Coast, the
world's largest cocoa producer.
   The Ivorians have been demanding exceptionally high premiums for
their cocoa for more than a year in an attempt to bolster sagging
prices worldwide, a problem caused by several years of surplus cocoa
production.
   Unable to sell much cocoa at its high asking price, the former
French colony ran out of storage space for this year's crop and
appealed to the French government for assistance in withholding
cocoa from the market.
   Silver futures prices tumbled for the fifth straight day on New
York's Commodity Exchange, reflecting slack investor demand and
ample supplies.
   The contract for December delivery fell to $5.98 a troy ounce
during the session but bounced back to settle 5.5 cents below
Friday's close at $6.025, the lowest Comex silver price since March
26, 1987.
   Other silver contracts lost as much as 6.9 cents on the day.
   ``I would say the next stop (or point of firm support) is
somewhere between $5.50 and $5.60,'' said Peter Cardillo,
commodities trading adviser for Josephthal & Co., a New York
brokerage firm.
   Gold settled $1.60 to $1.90 lower with December at $416.50 a troy
ounce.
   Soybean futures prices rebounded in afternoon trading to end
sharply higher on the Chicago Board of Trade. Corn finished mostly
higher while wheat prices fell.
   The turnaround in soybean prices followed steep daily declines in
that market during six of the past seven trading sessions. Monday's
rally was due largely to profit-taking by speculators who had sold
contracts in earlier sessions in hopes of buying them back at lower
prices, analysts said.
   Wheat settled } cent to 2} cents lower with December at $4.08\ a
bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to 2} cents higher with December at
$2.61 a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 5{ cents higher with December
at $2.06 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 15\ cents higher with
January at $7.46\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in uneventful trading ahead of the Agriculture
Department's monthly cold-storage report.
   The report, issued after the close, showed record-high frozen
pork supplies as of Nov. 1 of 321 million pounds. The previous Nov.
1 record was 312.2 million pounds in 1971, analysts said.
   The total included 49.6 million pounds of frozen pork bellies,
the second-largest monthly pork-belly stocks figure for any month on
record.
   The continued aggressive storage of pork bellies, which are
sliced to make bacon, means prices eventually will collapse, said
Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Inc. in Arlington
Heights, Ill.
   Live cattle settled .30 cent lower to .20 cent higher with
December at 72.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .52 cent to .80
cent lower with January at 81.45 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent
to .48 cent lower with December at 39.85 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .55 cent to .67 cent lower with February at 42.40 cents
a pound.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil settled 3 cents to 7 cents higher with January at $12.98 a
barrel; heating oil was .36 cent to .73 cent higher with December at
43.47 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was unchanged to 1.33 cents
lower with December at 44.32 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures posted moderate gains on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 settled 1.10 points higher at 266.90.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against West Point in Farley Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal court on Monday rejected two efforts by
West Point-Pepperell Inc. to stave off a buyout by Farley Inc. of
Chicago.
   Textile maker Pepperell had asked the 11th US Circuit Court of
Appeals to stay a U.S. District Court ruling allowing the takeover
bid and to grant an injunction postponing the bid while the lower
court ruling was appealed.
   A three-judge panel denied both motions but granted a Pepperell
motion for an expedited appeal.
   Pepperell had argued that an injunction would be only temporary
and could not harm Farley but that denial of one could cause serious
harm to Pepperell.
   Farley announced in May that it would try to buy Pepperell.
Farley owns about 9.8 percent of the company's stock. It has offered
around $1.57 billion, or $48 a share, for outstanding shares and
associated rights of Pepperell stock in an offer originally
scheduled to expire at midnight Monday.
   ``We are pleased by the court's decision to deny (Pepperell's)
application for a stay and also by its decision to expedite the
hearing,'' said William Farley, chief executive officer.
   Farley also said he's extending the offer to Wednesday, Nov. 30,
to expire at midnight New York time.
   Farley has secured financing but says three conditions must be
met before it will complete the tender offer.
   One is that Pepperell remove the hurdle caused by its ``poison
pill'' shareholders' rights plan, which allows shareholders not
involved in a takeover attempt to buy additional Pepperell shares in
case of a buyout attempt. This makes a buyout more expensive.
   U.S. District Judge Ernest Tidwell invalidated two key aspects of
the ``pill'' last week. The rest remains in place, where Pepperell
officials say they intend to keep it.
   Farley also wants Georgia's anti-takeover statute ruled
unconstitutional and insists that at least two-thirds of Pepperell's
shareholders tender their shares.
   Tidwell has taken the anti-takeover statute under advisement but
has not said when he might rule.
   ``Financing is the only thing Farley has in the bag,'' said Josie
Esquivel, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
``Even if shareholders tender 70 percent of their stock, Farley
still has to meet the other two conditions.''
   Farley manufactures Fruit of the Loom underwear. Pepperell
products include Gold Toe socks.

<HEAD>LTV Posts $1.24 Billion Loss in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LTV Corp. reported on Monday a third-quarter net
loss of $1.24 billion, which company officials attributed largely to
Chapter 11-related special charges.
   A change in accounting principles for post-employment medical and
life insurance benefits also had a negative impact on results,
officials of the diversified company said.
   The loss compares with a net profit of $109.7 million, or 91
cents a share, in the third quarter of 1987.
   LTV officials said the special charges and the accounting change
are important elements in moving the company toward its Chapter 11
reorganization.
   ``Because LTV is in Chapter 11, we believe it is appropriate for
the company to record all its liabilities, including the liability
for these post-employment benefits, so that they may be
appropriately dealt with in the reorganization process,'' said
Raymond Hay, LTV's chairman and chief executive officer.
   Angela Tese, a bankruptcy specialist for Cole & Deitz in New
York, said Monday's announcement of a negative net worth was not a
good signal for the company.
   ``They'll have to prove to the (bankruptcy) court that the plan
is feasible,'' Tese said. ``They are going to have to be able to
demonstrate to the court that they are healthy enough and that they
won't have to reorganize again sometime soon.''
   The third-quarter special charges total $1.34 billion, ost of
which is non-cash. They include:
   _$950 million for Chapter 11 creditors' claims;
   _$350 million for a reduction of assets and other anticipated
costs in the divesture of LTV Steel Co.'s bar business, as well as
additional costs incurred in the rationalization of other steel
facilities;
   _$41 million for the write-off of goodwill recorded in connection
with the company's 1983 acquisition of Sierra Research Corp.
   Without the two elements, LTV said its net income would have been
$132.2 million for the third quarter and $453.7 million for the
first nine months of the year. That would have compared with $109.7
million and $362.0 million for the respective periods in 1987.
   The change in accounting principle alters the method of
accounting for post-employment medical and life insurance benefits
and resulted in a one-time, non-cash charge of $2.26 billion,
recorded as of last Jan. 1.
   ``The accounting method adopted by LTV recognizes the
post-employment medical and life insurance benefits earned by all of
the company's retirees and active employees,'' Hay said.
``Previously these costs were recognized only as they were paid.''
   The change in accounting principle reduced operating income by
$32.1 million for the third quarter and $98.2 million for the
nine-month period.
   For the first nine months, LTV reported a net loss of $3.25
billion, which company officials also attributed to the special
charges and accounting change. That compared with a net profit of
$362.0 million, or $3.07 a share, in the same nine-month period of
1987.

<HEAD>Disney Profit Flat in 4th Qtr., Up 17 Percent for Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Walt Disney Co. said its
fourth-quarter profit was flat, but that its full-year earnings rose
17 percent, boosted by big-spending theme park patrons and a string
of hit movies.
   Disney reported Monday its profit was $136.4 million, or 99 cents
a share, in the fourth quarter, up marginally from $135.3 million,
or 98 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1987.
   Sales for the quarter ended Sept. 30 were $1.01 billion, up 34
percent from $758.6 million a year ago.
   The results of a subsidiary that has since been sold are included
in the figure for fourth-quarter 1987, reducing the
quarter-to-quarter gain. When only continuing operations are
compared, profits were 23 percent higher in the fourth quarter of
1988 than they were a year ago.
   For its entire fiscal year, Disney reported a profit of $522
million, or $3.80 a share, up 17 percent from $444.7 million, or
$3.23 a share, in 1987.
   Sales in fiscal 1988 were $3.44 billion, up 20 percent from $2.88
billion the previous year.
   In Disney's biggest division, theme parks and resorts, year-end
sales were up 11 percent, to $2.04 billion. The company, which
doesn't release attendance figures, said attendance was down from
last year, but that customers spent more.
   The movie and television division, riding high on the popularity
of ``Three Men and a Baby,'' ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' and ``Who
Framed Roger Rabbit,'' recorded a 31 percent gain in sales, to $1.15
billion for the year.
   An expanding string of stores selling Disney-themed toys and
clothes had sales of $84.6 million, up 78 percent from last year,
when far fewer stores were in operation.
   Results from Arvida Corp, a housing developer in Boca Raton,
Fla., that Disney has since sold, are included in both the fourth
quarter and year-end results for last year.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New housing starts fell 13.6 percent in the third
quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, a report by a
private research firm that follows the construction industry said
Monday.
   Starts fell to 371,042 units in the July through September period
from 429,376 starts in the same period in 1987, according to the
report from the F.W. Dodge Group of McGraw-Hill Information Services
Co.
   The decline was concentrated in multifamily housing construction,
Dodge vice president and economist George A. Christie said.
   ``Since the 1985 peak of the apartment building boom, new
construction has been scaled back by nearly half, but vacancy rates
have only recently begun to recede from their 20-year high,'' he
said.
   He said stability of mortgage rates in the 10 percent to 10{
percent range has supported a fairly steady volume of single-fanily
homebuilding this year.
   Leading the list of most active housing areas was Washington,
D.C., at 12,846 new units, followed by the Riverside-San Bernbardino
area at 11,103.
   In third place was the Los Angeles-Long Beach area at 10,320
units, followed by Atlanta at 10,071 and Philadelphia at 7,469.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were: Chicago, 7,295 units; Detroit,
6,980; Minneapolis-St. Paul, 6,037; Seattle, 6,022; and Phoenix,
5,021.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Petroleum PLC said on Monday that it had
accepted bids totalling $267 million for 15 percent of its Magnus
oil field in the British sector of the North Sea.
   The company said it was selling a 5 percent stake to Sun Oil
Britain Ltd., 5 percent to Repsol Exploration Ltd. and 2.5 percent
each to Goal Petroleum PLC and Braspetro Oil Services Co.
   Details of individual tenders were not disclosed, but the sale
valued each 1 percent of Magnus at an average of $17.8 million.
   BP Exploration Managing Director Hugh Norton said the company was
pleased with the transaction ``against a background of uncertain oil
prices.''
   To BP, the proceeds of the sale represented a return equivalent
to a crude oil price of $22 per 42-gallon barrel in 1989, rising in
real terms to $25 in 1995, Norton said. The company believes it
``sensible to realize this extra value now to invest in other
oppportunities for the benefit of our shareholders,'' he added.
   Completion of the sale is subject to the necessary regulatory
approvals, including that of the British energy secretary in the
transfer of license interests to the purchasers.

<HEAD>FTC Charges Merger Could Lessen Competition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission charged Monday
that the 1987 merger of Celanese Corp. into American Hoechst Corp.
could lessen competition in the manufacture and sale of a widely
used plastic.
   The commission's administrative complaint said the creation of
the new Hoechst Celanese Corp. ``could substantially lessen
international competition in the manufacture and sale of acetal,'' a
plastic used in items such as car parts and disposable lighters.
   In 1987, before the two companies merged, the FTC had contended
the merger could reduce competition in the production of polyester
textile fiber in the United States. A consent agreement was worked
out which allowed the merger to go ahead.
   FTC spokeswoman Susan Ticknor said the new complaint would be
considered by an administrative law judge, and hearing dates were
expected to be set on Jan. 3.
   Hoechst Celanese, which is based in Somerville, N.J., issued a
statement saying it was confident it will prevail in the matter.
   ``We are astounded that the FTC has decided to pursue it,'' said
James Conway, vice president and general manager of the Engineering
Plastics Division. ``The matter will have no impact on our
day-to-day activities.''
   Before the merger, Hoechst AG, the company's West German parent,
and Celanese Corp. manufactured acetal in West Germany through a
joint venture, Ticona Polymerwerke GmbH. The FTC is contending the
merger eliminated competition between Celanese and Ticona in the
world acetal market, affecting prices in the United States, Hoechst
Celanese stated.

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Jersey banking officials announced
Monday that the state's new interstate savings and loan law had
taken effect, allowing savings institutions from 13 other states to
make acquisitions in New Jersey.
   The law took effect Nov. 15, but until the announcement it had
been unclear when the measure, signed into law last year, actually
would take force, said Kyra Lindemann, a spokeswoman for the state
Department of Banking.
   ``Today we have given our savings and loan associations the same
tools and flexibility so that they may continue to be progressive
and effective players in the ever-expanding ... marketplace,'' she
said in a statement.
   The law allows federally or state-chartered institutions with
proper insurance to engage in interstate acquisitions with similar
thrifts on a reciprocal basis. That means New Jersey institutions
also may make acquisitions in those other states.
   State Banking Commissioner Mary Parell determined that 13 states
meet New Jersey's reciprocity test, Ms. Lindemann said. The states
are: Arizona, Idaho, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, New York, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming.

   Ford Motor Co. on Monday recalled 341,000
1986 and 1987 Aerostar minivans because of a potential problem in a
hinge and the track assemblies on sliding doors.
   Operators of affected minivans may notice that the cargo door
becomes difficult to move and may become jammed and the door may
leave the track in extreme cases, the automaker said.
   Ford said in a news release that the problem does not affect the
vehicle's safety.
   Owners of the affected vehicles will be notified in writing. If
there is a problem, Ford will cover costs of parts and labor and
will reimburse owners who already had work done on the problem.
   The company said about 310,000 of the vehicles were sold in the
United States, 30,000 were sold in Canada and about 950 were sold
elsewhere.

   Humorist Art Buchwald filed a $5 million
lawsuit against Paramount Pictures on Monday, accusing the studio of
stealing his idea for the movie ``Coming to America,'' one of last
summer's biggest hits.
   ``It's not only the biggest hit of the year, it will probably be
the biggest hit of the decade,'' said Buchwald's attorney, Pierce
O'Donnell.
   ``Coming to America,'' greeted with mixed reviews, collected hugh
box office receipts last summer, trailing Disney's hit ``Who Framed
Roger Rabbit,'' which has collected more than $147 million. The
trade newspaper Daily Variety said ``Coming to America'' has grossed
more than $120 million.
   O'Donnell said Buchwald is entitled to his promised share of an
anticipated $250 million in profits for a story ``strikingly
similar'' to the movie script.
   ``He sold the idea to Paramount'' O'Donnell said. ``He told them,
`You can change it, fold, spindle or mutilate it, but you have to
pay me.'''
   The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, is the second
action disputing the origin of the hit movie, which starred comedian
Eddie Murphy.
   ``Eddie Murphy wrote the story 100 percent,'' said Murphy's
manager, Bob Wachs. ``There are many suits on `Coming To America.'
Mr. Buchwald is one of the last to file,'' he said.
   ``We don't comment on matters of this kind,'' said Deborah Rosen,
senior vice president of corporate communications for Paramount.
   Murphy, who is not named in Buchwald's suit, has said he came up
with the original idea for ``Coming to America,'' the tale of an
African prince who comes to New York, works in a fast food
restaurant and takes a wife.
   Buchwald's script, called ``King For A Day,'' tells of a king
from an oil-rich country who comes to Washington, loses his power in
a coup while he's absent, winds up living in a ghetto where he works
for a caterer and pursues a woman who works for the State Department.
   The ``Coming to America'' story is similar, but the action occurs
in New York and Murphy's love interest is the daughter of the man
who owns the fast food chain where he works.
   Buchwald said his story, presented in an eight-page treatment,
was optioned by Paramount in 1983.
   But Paramount officially dropped the project in January 1985, and
Buchwald subsequently sold the idea to Warner Bros., which dropped
it when word surfaced that Paramount had a similar movie in
production, O'Donnell said. The attorney said Buchwald had ``an iron
clad contract'' with Paramount, which called for him to receive a
flat fee plus percentages of net profits when ``King For A Day'' was
produced.
   The columnist said he has written about 10 Hollywood screen
treatments in the past and ``I've always gotten paid.'' He said none
of those ideas ever became a movie.
   With more income expected from home video sales and foreign
markets, O'Donnell said the movie is expected to gross $250 million.
   ``Murphy's manager said the actor came up with the idea,'' said
O'Donnell. ``The problem is that Murphy and his manager both read
Mr. Buchwald's story.''
   O'Donnell said he can prove that they read it based on his
two-month investigation of the case.
   The lawsuit alleges breach of contract rather than copyright
infringement. A second plaintiff, producer Alain Bernheim, also is
suing saying he had a contract to produce Buchwald's script.
   Bernheim has produced such movies as ``Racing With the Moon'' and
``Yes, Giorgio,'' O'Donnell said.
   The lawsuit seeks $5 million in compensatory damages and
unspecified punitive damages.
   O'Donnell said Buchwald is not suing Murphy because he was not a
party to the Paramount agreement.
   Another lawsuit pending in federal court also claims the original
idea for ``Coming To America'' was purloined.
   Shelby M. Gregory, 38, of Hollywood, has filed a $10 million
copyright lawsuit in Los Angeles federal court naming Murphy, two
writers and Paramount Studios.

<TEXT>
   Hospital Corporation of America's board
of directors on Monday approved a $3.6 billion leveraged buyout plan
led by senior management, just over a month after rejecting the
offer.
   The board of the nation's largest health care concern announced
late Monday it had agreed to the $51 a share cash and securities
offer by TF Investments Inc., a company formed by HCA management and
headed by HCA Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thomas F. Frist
Jr.
   The group's offer includes $43 in cash and $8 in securities for
each of HCA's 71.4 million common shares outstanding.
   HCA stock closed up 62{ cents at $46.62{ a share Monday on the
New York Stock exchange.
   The offer still must be approved by HCA stockholders in a
February meeting, company officials stated in a news release. No
date was given for the meeting.
   Frist could be immediately reached for comment.
   A special committee of outside directors had rejected the Frist
group's initial offer of $47 a share, and rejected the $51 a share
proposal on Oct. 17. The committee at that time indicated it would
accept bids from other parties through Nov. 18, although a number of
industry analysts expressed skepticism the company would get a
higher offer.
   ``The board's approval was based in part upon the recommendation
of a special committee of board comprised of nine outside directors
and the opinion of Morgan Stanley that, as of Nov. 21, 1988, the
consideration to be paid in the merger is fair to HCA shareholders
from a financial point of view,'' according to board's Monday
release.
   HCA spokesman John Van Mol said he did not know whether any other
offers were made by the Nov. 18 deadline.
   HCA, which owns or operates nearly 400 hospitals worldwide, set
up the special committee to consider buyout offers after the initial
proposal in mid-September.
   The company sold 104 of its less profitable hospitals just over a
year ago to a new employee-owned company, HealthTrust Inc., in a
spinoff that netted HCA almost $1.6 billion.

   A federal judge will hear motions next month
stemming from three jurors' claims that they were intimidated into
voting for an $8.15 million judgment against the maker of the Copper
7 intrauterine device, Monsanto Co. said Monday.
   Monsanto, whose G.D. Searle & Co. subsidiary manufactured the
Copper 7, on Monday released a letter that the jurors sent to U.S.
District Judge Robert Renner, who presided over the trial.
   The jury on Sept. 9 awarded the damages to Esther Kociemba, who
claimed the birth control device had left her infertile.
   The three jurors, whose names were withheld at their request,
also indicated they did not believe the plaintiff proved her claim
that the device caused her injuries.
   The judgment represented the first jury award of punitive damages
against Searle in a Copper 7 case. The pharmaceutical company has
won 15 of 19 Copper 7 damage cases that have gone before a jury.
   Monsanto spokesman Mark L. Schannon said Searle attorneys would
introduce motions to vacate the award.
   Renner will hear the motions Dec. 1 in U.S. District Court at St.
Paul, Minn., Schannon said. Renner can let the verdict stand, reduce
the award or order a new trial, Schannon said.
   The letter from the three jurors claimed that ``continual verbal
harassment and intimidation'' by the jury foreman during
deliberations prevented them from expressing their opinion about the
trial evidence.
   ``Our failure to understand the purpose and-or power of the jury
foreman facilitated our inability to express individual opinions,''
the letter read.
   The three jurors also stated that a desire to inform the court of
a 4-4 split among jury was prevented by ``a convenient
interpretation of the jury and judge's instructions.''
   ``Any opinions which conflicted with the foreman's (plaintiff's)
views were met with disdain and contempt and resulted in additional
verbal and-or physical harassment,'' the letter said. ``When the
obvious difference of opinion became apparent, discussions and
negotiations ceased.
   ``While believing that Searle may have been negligent in
advertising, we individually assessed that Esther Kociemba never
proved that the CU-7 caused her injuries...'' the letter read.
   ``Summarily, we individually and collectively feel ashamed and
embarrassed to be associated with a verdict against our true
opinions,'' the three wrote.
   Richard S. Duesenberg, Monsanto's general counsel, said the
jurors wrote the letter on their own initiative and neither Monsanto
nor Searle saw the letter until it was received by Renner.
   ``This is an important letter for our shareholders for two
reasons: first, the plaintiff's attorneys failed to convince the
full jury that the Cu-7 cause the plaintiff's injuries, and second,
this case should not be viewed as a watershed,'' Duesenberg said.
   In Minnesota, Mrs. Kociemba's attorney issued a statement
labeling the letter legally irrelevant, and accusing Searle lawyers
of having met with the three jurors.
   ``This is simploy a desperate and futile attempt by Searle and
Monsanto to achieve a result they couldn't achieve in court,''
stated lawyer Michael Ciresi. ``This is nothing more than
post-verdict jury tampering.''
