<HEAD>ABC Developing New Prime-Time News Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC News is developing a new prime-time news
program that could show up on the network's schedule next fall,
says ABC Entertainment President Brandon Stoddard.
   ``They're developing a couple of shows and I think there's a
possibility ABC News would have another hour prime time come fall,
I just don't know what time period or when or what the show would
be, but there is active development in that area,'' Stoddard told a
news conference on Monday.
   The ABC programmer stirred controversy last year when he
announced he was moving ABC's ``20-20'' newsmagazine out of its
successful Thursday night time period. The news division feared the
show's ratings would decline, but much of its audience apparently
followed it to Friday and it finished the season in the mid-range
of the A.C. Nielsen Co. rankings.
   If there is a new news show, it might be the only new show ready
to start in the fall. Stoddard said he wasn't optimistic of an
early end to the 6-week-old Writers Guild of America strike.
   He suggested if it lasts into June, it could substantially delay
the start of the 1988-89 television season, causing more defections
by network viewers to alternatives like cable and videocassettes.
   According to Nielsen figures, the three networks lost 9 percent
of their audience between last season and this season, though the
networks blame part of the reduction on a change in Nielsen's
audience measurement system.
   Stoddard said a delay in the start of the new season would force
networks the keep running repeats.
   ``In addition to that, when the strike is finished, and we start
putting programs on the air, there's going to be tremendous
pressure to get something up on that screen, and maybe it ain't
perfect when we do,'' he said.
   ``I think there also could be some erosion caused by the lack of
quality. This is a very serious problem.''
   Of this season's new shows, Stoddard said he was most
disappointed in ``Dolly!'' and that the network was considering
buying out star Dolly Parton and canning the show next year. Parton
got a two-year guarantee last year.
   ``As you all know, we actually have the right not to do the
show,'' Stoddard said. ``There is a penalty payment we would pay if
we did not go ahead on the second year.'' He would not say how much
it is.
   Stoddard also listed ``Moonlighting'' as a disappointment.
Formerly a top-10 show, ``Moonlighting'' dropped into the top 20
this season, due to frequent repeats and episodes without Cybill
Shepherd during her pregnancy. Nevertheless, Stoddard said, the
show most likely will be back next season.
   Other likely returnees are ``The Wonder Years'' and
``thirtysomething.'' Stoddard said he was optimistic that
``Hooperman'' would be renewed and that executive producer Steven
Bochco had even developed a spinoff. ``The `Slap' Maxwell Story''
is going to be a tough call, Stoddard said.
   While happy his network was second this season in the Nielsen
ratings, with an average, prime-time rating of 13.7 to CBS' 13.5,
Stoddard said the performance really was ``not that terrific.'' NBC
had a 16.1.
   Without high-rated prime-time sports programming _ the World
Series, the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics _ ABC actually was
third in the ratings.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million homes
with televisions.

   New York gave Democratic leaders what they
wanted, a front-runner, but the history of their roller-coaster
process made many reluctant to declare that Michael Dukakis had the
nominaton locked up.
   ``We no longer have the winner-a-week syndrome,'' James Ruvolo,
chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said Tuesday. But he quickly
added, ``I don't think you can say it's over.''
   One of the few party leaders willing to describe Dukakis as the
nominee was Lynn Cutler, deputy chair of the Democratic National
Committee.
   ``I think we have a nominee,'' said Cutler. But she warned that
the Dukakis campaign must be ``very careful not to look as though
it's a done deal.''
   Peter D. Kelly, chairman of the California Democratic Party,
said many of the elected and party officials, designated as super
delegates to the nominating convention, may be reluctant to jump
too quickly onto the Dukakis bandwagon.
   ``They're going to want to be real careful about angering Jesse
Jackson and his supporters,'' said Kelly. ``I, for one, am very
sensitive about offending that constituency.''
   Dukakis' big victory in New York essentially knocked Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. out of the race, finally paring the Democratic field down
to a two-man contest _ Dukakis versus Jackson.
   The Massachusetts governor was assured of a big delegate harvest
in Pennsylvania next Tuesday after Jackson filled only about 65
percent of the 178 delegate slots at stake.
   But caution stemmed in part from the fact that for months every
time a candidate was on verge of claiming front-runner status, the
voters knocked him down a peg.
   An even stronger factor was the formidable presence of Jackson
and the need now to seriously confront the often-asked question,
``What does Jesse want?''
   On the campaign trail, Jackson relishes ridiculing that
question, responding with a recitation of the basic liberal
Democratic agenda _ a higher minimum wage, health care, housing, a
shifting of priorities away from those of the Reagan administration.
   Repeatedly, Jackson has also said he wanted to ``enable our
party to win'' and was determined to ``play a role in making that
happen.''
   When a questioner at a New York breakfast asked Jackson what he
would do if he didn't get the nomination, the candidate replied
that it was important to ``put the nation first and party second
and your role third.''
   Among the established leaders of the party there was concern
about what Jackson's large constituency, so essential to Democratic
victories in general elections, would do if he failed to get the
nomination.
   Ruvolo said it was important for Dukakis to continue campaigning
hard in Pennsylvania, Ohio and other upcoming primary states, to
avoid being embarrassed, but also because the contest ``has to be
perceived as a fair fight'' by Jackson's supporters.
   Said Cutler, ``I think we have to be very careful in these next
weeks that Rev. Jackson's candidacy continues to be treated with
respect, well-earned credit for everything that he's done for the
party.''

   Three top Justice Department aides to Deputy
Attorney General Arnold Burns are quitting or transferring to new
jobs, marking a new round of departures and creating additional
problems for Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   All three deputies rejected overtures by aides to Meese to
remain at the Justice Department after the abrupt March 29
resignations of Burns and criminal division chief William Weld,
department sources said Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, Meese said he expects to hear shortly from St. Louis
attorney John Shepherd on whether the former American Bar
Association president plans to withdraw from consideration as
Burns' successor.
   ``Probably tomorrow,'' Justice Department spokesman Terry
Eastland said Tuesday evening when asked whether there was any word
on Shepherd's status.
   Shepherd, 62, told Meese last Friday that he was giving serious
consideration to withdrawing because of stress on his family
stemming from his selection.
   A former bookkeeper from Shepherd's law firm testified shortly
before Meese recommended him for the post that she had an affair
with Shepherd. The bookkeeper, who was convicted of embezzlement,
claimed Shepherd had told her to write checks to herself. Shepherd
denied that he had an affair with her or that he had authorized her
to write checks.
   The Washington Post reported in Wednesday's editions, meanwhile,
that Shepherd was recommended for a Justice Department position in
late 1984 or early 1985 by E. Robert Wallach, a longtime Meese
associate now under indictment in connection with the Wedtech
scandal in New York. The Post, quoting Justice Department sources,
said Shepherd's ties to Wallach came up in the FBI's background
checks of Shepherd and ``caused some concern.''
   The Post also reported that Shepherd agreed not to withdraw from
consideration until Thursday, to give Meese time to find a
replacement.
   Two other deputies to Burns, Randy Levine and Boykin Rose, also
handed in their resignations March 29. The latest exit of personnel
would virtually empty the No. 2 office in the Justice Department of
top aides.
   It is customary for the deputy attorney general to pick his own
assistants. But the sources said Meese's staff has sought to keep
top deputies' posts filled following the resignations of Burns and
Weld and the vacancy in the department's No. 3 position due to the
departure of Associate Attorney General Stephen Trott, who is now a
federal judge.
   Burns resigned with Weld out of concern that Meese's continuing
legal troubles stemming from a nearly year-long criminal
investigation were damaging the Justice Department's operations,
morale and image.
   The department sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the latest departures included: Raymond B. Ludwiszewski, Paul
Cassell and Gregory Walden.
   Ludwiszewski, an associate deputy attorney general who came to
the Justice Department in 1985, has handed in his resignation and
is negotiating with private Washington law firms for work, the
sources said.
   Ludwiszewski, who was graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law
School in 1984 and was on the Harvard Law Review, specialized in
legal issues pertaining to the lands and civil rights divisions and
the solicitor general's office.
   Cassell, a Burns deputy who dealt with issues involving the
department's criminal and antitrust divisions, is transferring to
the U.S. attorney's office in Alexandria, Va., where he will become
an assistant U.S. attorney. Cassell was president of the Stanford
Law Review.
   In a move that has been in the planning stages for some time,
Walden, an associate deputy attorney general, is to become chief
counsel to the Federal Aviation Administration. He will leave the
Justice Department in a few weeks. Walden, who has been with the
department since 1983, has helped spearhead the government's
various criminal investigations of former Philippines President
Ferdinand Marcos.
   Burns' last day at the department is Friday.

<HEAD>AIDS Cases Likely to Multiply Five Times in Next Three Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of full-blown AIDS cases in the
world is likely to increase fivefold in the next three years, and
hundreds of millions of people probably engage in activity that
leaves them vulnerable, says the head of the World Health
Organization's AIDS program.
   ``While it has become fashionable to reassure and state that
AIDS will never threaten large populations, we believe that
virology, immunology, sociology and epidemiology require us to take
the long view, and a more somber view,'' Dr. Jonathan Mann told the
White House AIDS commission Monday.
   ``Let us remember that we are still in the early phases of a
global epidemic whose first decade gives us every rational reason
for concern about the global future of AIDS,'' he said. ``HIV (the
AIDS virus) does not need to spread rapidly in a population to have
a tremendous and gradually expanding cumulative effect.''
   Mann said that while no precise figures are available, ``it is
likely that several hundred million people around the world may
have behaviors which make them potentially vulnerable to infection
with HIV.''
   While he did not spell out such behavior at that point in his
testimony, it was clear he was referring primarily to unprotected
sex with potentially infected partners and, secondarily, to drug
users sharing needles with people who may be carrying the virus.
   ``Individual behavior is responsible for most HIV
transmission,'' he said. ``This transmission requires the active
participation of two persons. Therefore, the chain of transmission
can be broken by the individual behavior of either the infected or
the non-infected person. For this reason, the proper focus of
prevention is behavior.''
   He said education is essential to combating the epidemic.
   ``If intravenous drug users do not understand the words you use
to describe needles, syringes and other drug equipment, they cannot
learn prevention. If adolescents are convinced that AIDS is being
used to deprive them of sexual freedom, they may refuse to listen
to prevention messages and even counterreact in ways that further
endanger their lives,'' Mann said.
   More than 81,000 AIDS cases were reported to the organization as
of the end of February, but the actual number of AIDS cases is
believed to be twice the reported total.
   WHO estimates that between 5 million and 10 million people are
infected with the virus and that 150,000 new cases of fully
developed AIDS will be reported during the coming year.
   ``If we adopt the conservative estimate then 5 million people
are infected today with HIV (the AIDS virus), a cumulative total of
1 million AIDS cases would be expected by 1991,'' he said. ``Thus,
the period 1988-91 will likely witness over five times more AIDS
cases than have thus far occurred.''
   Dr. Jean William Pape of the Cornell University Medical College
told the panel the epidemic in Haiti and Trinidad is shifting
dramatically to one of heterosexual transmission.
   Whereas only 26 percent of the cases reported in Haiti 1983 were
believed to have resulted from heterosexual sex, the number jumped
to 64 percent last year.
   In Trinidad, he said, only 12 percent of the cases reported in
1985 were attributed to likely heterosexual sex, compared to 58
percent last year.

   A spurned lover was sentenced to 12 years in
prison for shooting off the tip of his former girlfriend's nose
after she ended their relationship early last year.
   Krikor Chouchanian, 47, of Santa Monica, was taken into custody
Monday immediately after Superior Court Judge David Yaffe sentenced
him and rejected a motion for bail pending appeal.
   Chouchanian was convicted last month of the attempted murder of
Eiman ``Amy'' Rahal, a 28-year-old bellydancer. The jury also
convicted him of the special allegations of use of a firearm and
causing great bodily injury.
   The panel, however, rejected an allegation that the shooting was
premeditated, which could have brought a life sentence.
   During the trial, Miss Rahal testified that Chouchanian tried to
kill her three times after she broke off their relationship.

<HEAD>Modern-Day Revere Rides To Lexington Dodging Manholes, Battling
Laryngitis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Revere's laryngitis made it hard for him to
shout, ``The British are coming.'' William Dawes got locked in a
men's room during a rest stop. And the rain made slippery manholes
treacherous for the patriots' horses.
   Otherwise, Patriots' Day on Monday was the occasion of a
satisfactory re-staging of the 13-mile mission to Lexington 213
years ago that alerted revolutionary colonists that British troops
were heading their way.
   ``I'm ready to go back,'' Harold Snow said in a cracking voice
at the end of the 2{-hour horseback ride from Boston. It was the
seventh portrayal of Paul Revere for the 72-year-old entrepreneur
from Wellesley who is a brigadier general in the Massachusetts
National Lancers.
   For decades, the ceremonial militia of 30 men has roughly
recreated in daytime the horseback ride that Revere, Dawes and Dr.
Samuel Prescott made in the late hours of April 18, 1775.
   By alerting the insurrectionary colonists that British troops
were on their way to Concord, the 18th century trio set in motion
the next day's confrontation that started the American Revolution.
   Monday, Douglas Dougherty, a lieutenant in the lancers who
portrayed Dawes, was freed from a men's room in Arlington in time
to meet up with Snow for their grand finale in Lexington where they
were met by a cheering crowd estimated at 500 people.
   This year's journey was considerably harder than the one taken
the first time around. Just before Snow left Boston with a send-off
from Mayor Raymond Flynn, he groused about the rain. His costume of
three-cornered hat, wig, cloak and boots made for a hot ride
compared to Revere's, who had the advantage of a cool, clear night
and his own clothes.
   Snow also had to watch out for slippery manholes.
   But Snow said he enjoyed himself and was grateful for the
audience along the way that ignored the Boston Marathon.
   When Snow left Boston's North End, where Revere lived in a house
that still stands, a throng of spectators stood under store awnings
and a makeshift canopy of umbrellas. There were grinning toddlers,
graying baby-boomers taking off for the state holiday and elderly
Italian widows.
   ``This is how America was founded,'' said Patti Gant, an
accountant from Everett, who recommended historical re-enactments
as a way to understand this country.
   ``You've got to get the concept of where you come from to know
where you go from here,'' said Ms. Gant, 50.
   Frank Federico, 35, a pharmacist who grew up in the old, narrow
streets of the North End, said he's been coming to see Revere ride
off his entire life. That's why he brought his 10-year-old son,
Michael, he said.
   ``It's a family tradition,'' the elder Federico said with a nod
toward his son. ``It's important to see what you read about in the
classroom.''

<HEAD>Ballet Theater Opens Season with Panache</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs Planned</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Ballet Theater opened its two-month
season at the Metropolitan Opera House with panache _ the kind of
dancing, style and brio that expects, deserves and receives bravos.
   Monday's program began with Mikhail Baryshnikov's new production
and staging of ``Raymonda (Grand Pas Classique).'' Martine van
Hamel, a commanding stage presence as well as a glorious ballerina,
was partnered superbly by Kevin McKenzie.
   Amanda McKerrow, who danced the fourth solo variation, which
requires lightness, long extension and some difficult balances, has
blossomed into the ballerina her early promise predicted.
   Baryshnikov staged the ballet after Marius Petipa, incorporating
the grand pas de dix from Act 3 and several variations from the
full-length ``Raymonda.'' Music is by Glazounov.
   Antony Tudor, who died last year, choreographed ``The Leaves Are
Fading'' for American Ballet Theater in 1975. The music is by
Dvorak. Sometimes this seems merely an overlong, pretty ballet, in
which the women's thin skirts ripple as the men lift them and they
seem to float.
   On Monday, it was a beautiful ballet. The various moods were
strongly defined. There is much more than a pastel sense of autumn
and saying goodby. Exquisite dancing _ which was seen opening night
_ is important. Dim lighting instead of very noticeable dappled
lighting helps, too, allowing the dancers and the music to hold
prominence.
   Leslie Browne and Robert Hill were the nimble leading couple,
their virtuosic dancing having a carefree air about it.
   The evening ended with the first New York performance of the
company's production of George Balanchine's ``Ballet Imperial.''
The company looks comfortable with this Balanchine piece, which is
more classical than his usual _ he based it on the Petipa style.
Also, in this 1941 ballet, there are intertwinings which are
Balanchine trademarks.
   ``Ballet Imperial'' is as visually regal as the ``Raymonda''
which began the evening and the dancing was as glittering as the
women's small crowns. Susan Jaffe and Ross Stretton were the
impressive leading couple and Miss McKerrow distinguished herself
again in solos.
   Michael Boriskin was the thundering soloist in Tchaikovsky's
``Second Piano Concerto'' for ``Ballet Imperial.'' Jack Everly
conducted the entire evening.

<HEAD>Children Working Illegally In Areas Of High Employment, Department
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employers in areas of low joblessness are
increasingly turning to using teen-agers in violation of child
labor laws as an alternative to paying higher wages to attract and
retain adults, Labor Department officials say.
   Illegal employment of children increased by more than 50 percent
in 1987, the Labor Department said Monday. It said the most
dramatic increase in violations occurred in the Northeast, where
unemployment rates are lowest.
   ``Because of the high levels of employment, we're finding a lot
of firms hiring minors illegally for positions formerly held by
older workers,'' said Nancy Flynn, deputy administrator of the
department's wage-hour division. ``It's a trend in that geographic
region.''
   The number of children nationwide that the department found to
be illegally employed last year was slightly more than 19,000, up
from 12,662 in 1986.
   The department said it assessed civil fines totaling $1.5
million last year against 811 companies illegally employing 10,160
minors.
   Under the labor protection laws, children ages 14 and 15 can
hold limited, non-hazardous jobs, but the number of hours they can
work is restricted. Children ages 16 and 17 can work full-time but
not in dangerous occupations such as roofing, excavation work and
mining or around hazardous machinery.
   The biggest violator, the department said, was a large chain of
supermarkets in the Northeast which was working children too many
hours a week and illegally employing them in hazardous occupations
such as meat cutting.
   Ms. Flynn would not identify the supermarket chain, saying the
case is still being litigated.
   The department said it found that nearly 488,000 U.S. workers
were cheated out of $126 million last year through employer
violations of minimum wage, overtime pay and other provisions of
the Fair Labor Standards Act.
   At least 155,000 workers were due $28.5 million in minimum wage
violations and 329,000 employers were underpaid at total of $98
million in overtime due them, said Assistant Labor Secretary Fred
Alvarez.
   Of those amounts, the department recovered about $20.2 million
in minimum wages for 136,000 of the workers who were underpaid and
$79.5 million for 293,000 of those not paid overtime.
   The department also assessed $873,430 in civil penalties against
farm labor contractors for violations of pay and health and safety
standards under the Migrant Worker Protection Act.

   A 28-room mansion built as a wedding
gift has gained a reputation of bringing bad luck to those who live
there: Three of its residents have faced criminal charges, two have
lost their fortunes and one killed himself.
   The latest owners of Dunnellen Hall are real estate tycoons
Harry and Leona Helmsley, who were indicted last week on New York
state and federal tax charges.
   ``It wasn't the happiest home,'' said Marjorie Rowe, president
of Preferred Properties Inc., who handled two of the sales of the
mansion. ``It seems as if some very wealthy people who lived there
lost their fortunes. If the walls could talk ...''
   The house sits on 26 acres in Greenwich, hometown to such
notables as Donald Trump and Diana Ross. The average price of a
home here is about $1 million, real estate agents say.
   It was built in 1918 at a cost of $1 million for Daniel Grey
Reid, president of the American Tin Plate Co., as a wedding gift
for his daughter, Rhea. She married Henry J. Topping, son of John
A. Topping, president of Republic Steel.
   The estate, referred to locally as the ``Topping House,'' was
named Dunnellen Hall by Rhea Reid Topping for her mother, Ella Dunn.
   It was sold for the first time in 1950 to Loring Washburn,
president of S.H. Pormeroy & Co., a steel fabricating company. But
he suffered financial troubles and lost the house in 1963.
   Others who have had trouble after they moved into the house were:
   _Daniel Moran, a former New York City policeman who was married
to Gregg Sherwood Dodge, a heiress to the Dodge automobile fortune.
Moran shot and killed a busboy who apparently was trying to climb
into the bedroom window of their Florida home in 1968. The slaying
was ruled justifiable homicide.
   Moran killed himself in 1977, although a judge would not say
whether the shooting was intentional or accidental.
   _Investor Jack Dick. He was indicted by a New York City grand
jury on 46 counts of grand larceny and forgery for allegedly
stealing $840,000 through the use of false documents to obtain a
loan.
   He pleaded innocent in 1971. The case was pending when he died
suddenly in 1974 at the age of 46 while being driven to the estate
by his chauffeur.
   _Ravi Tikkoo, owner of the one of the world's largest oil
supertankers. He lost the bulk of his fortune during the OPEC oil
embargo and petroleum shortages in the mid-1970s.
   The Helmsleys, one of the world's wealthiest couples at an
estimated $1.4 billion and with a stake in the Empire State
Building, bought the estate in 1983 for $11 million.
   The Helmsleys pleaded innocent last week to charges in a
188-count New York state tax evasion indictment. They are accused
by New York officials of avoiding taxes by claiming about $4
million in renovations to Dunnellen Hall as business expenses at
their hotels.
   The couple also face a 47-count federal indictment on similar
charges.
   Phyllis Parizek, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut Department of
Revenue Services, said Monday that two auditors had been assigned
to examine the Helmsleys' finances.
   Last week, Timothy F. Bannon, state commisioner of revenue
services, said his investigators were taking a close look at the
New York charges to determine if any Connecticut taxes were owed on
items at the estate.
   One of the Helmsley's attorneys, Stephen Kaufman, said Monday
that he thought the couple would not fall victim to the curse.
   ``I'm sure the Helmsley's have broken the bad luck streak at
Dunnnellen,'' Kaufman said.
   Louis Duff, president of Duff Associates Inc., which handled the
sale of the estate for Lynda Dick, widow of Jack Dick, said the
property had been compared to a famous gem with a bad reputation.
   ``She (Lynda) said this place is like the Hope Diamond _
everyone who ever owned it and lived here had bad luck,'' Duff said
Monday. ``I argued with Lynda at the time, but I wouldn't argue
with her today.''
   According to the book ``Diamonds Eternal,'' by Victor Argenzio,
the gem was owned by Louis XVI, who went to guillotine with his
wife. A Dutch cutter who changed the stone's appearance had the
stone stolen from him by his own son who later killed himself.
   Turkish sultan Abdul Hamid II, lost his throne and had to
abdicate shortly after aquiring stone in 1908, the book said.
   Later, after Edward and Evalyn McLean acquired the stone, their
first son was killed in an auto crash, and McLean was implicated in
the Teapot Dome scandal and died in mental institution.
   After Mrs. McLean's death in 1947, the diamond was purchased by
Harry Winston, who gave it to the current owner, the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington.

   A congressional study is giving fresh
ammunition to conservationists and lawmakers who want to end the
big-bucks losses sustained by taxpayers from timber sales in
America's largest national forest.
   Weighing in on the side of the sales program's critics, the
General Accounting Office says Congress should scrap the 1980 law
requiring the U.S. Forest Service to market a minimum amount of
timber from Tongass National Forest in Alaska.
   GAO, the investigative wing of Congress, said in a study
released Monday that the requirement cost the Treasury $22.1
million in 1986 and has not created the lumbering jobs it was
supposed to in southeast Alaska.
   The 1980 law directs the Forest Service to offer to sell at
least 4.5 billion board feet of Tongass timber each decade and
guarantees at least $40 million in spending a year to support the
sales program.
   The law resulted from a compromise worked out by
conservationists and Alaska lawmakers. In return for the guarantee
program, conservationists would get 5.4 million of the forest's
16.8 million acres declared wilderness, putting them off-limits to
commercial use.
   The Tongass is the only national forest with a minimum sales
goal set by law, although Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, has proposed
a similar guarantee for the Panhandle National Forest in his state.
   Last month, the House Interior Committee approved legislation to
repeal the Tongass guarantee. A similar bill is pending in the
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
   The proposals are being pushed by environmental and conservation
groups who say the guarantee leads to lost tax dollars, unnecessary
roadbuilding by the Forest Service and needless harvesting of
400-year-old trees.
   The GAO study, requested by Sens. William Proxmire, D-Wis., and
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said sales of Tongass timber should be
subject to market supply-and-demand forces.
   GAO said that from 1981 through 1986, sales of Tongass timber
averaged 245 million board feet a year, some 205 million below the
yearly average needed to meet the 10-year goal.
   Focusing on 1986, GAO said the Forest Service spent $47.9
million on the Tongass and realized only $3.3 million in revenues.
The net loss was $22.1 million because some spending was for timber
production in future years, according to the study.
   From 1981 through 1986, $131 million was spent to prepare for
timber sales that were not needed to meet existing demand, the
study said.
   ``The timber supply provision should be revised so that the
amount supplied would be based on the anticipated demand for timber
and on the data currently being formulated by the Forest Service
... rather than on a rigid per-decade requirement,'' the study said.
   GAO said Tongass-related timber jobs declined from 2,700 in 1980
to 1,420 in 1986 ``primarily because of the decreased harvest
levels resulting from declining demand for timber and increased
production by the Alaska native corporations that directly compete
with the Tongass timber industry.''
   The Forest Service chief, F. Dale Robertson, said in a letter to
GAO that the proposal to scrap the Tongass guarantee ``has merit.''
   Stevens said in a prepared statement that GAO focused on a
low-demand portion of an economic cycle and that timber has since
rebounded. He said money must be spent on the Tongass even in slack
periods in order to meet peak demand.
   He also said the study is flawed because it focused only on the
guarantee, not on the other side of the 1980 compromise:
prohibiting commercial activities in nearly one-third of the
Tongass.

   Knocking down barriers to trade among the 12
countries of the European Community by 1992 will also benefit
outside countries such as the United States and Japan, a researcher
says.
   The main advantage to outside trading partners from greater
unification would be in having only a single set of rules to deal
with, instead of a dozen, said Paolo Cecchini, assigned by the
Community to study the issue.
   ``A foreign company that sells to only one of the 12 will have
jumped over the culture gap,'' he said Monday.
   Ella Krucoff, press officer for the Community's Washington
office, gave labeling requirements on European imports as an
example. Now each of the 12 governments has its own rules.
   Cecchini added that since there would be no official
discrimination against subsidiaries of foreign firms within the
Community, they too would benefit from any additional growth.
   Cecchini said that over the ``medium term'' _ about five years _
new measures of unification also could create as many as 5 million
new jobs in Europe, where unemployment is higher than in this
country. .
   He said about 200 people have contributed to his project called
``The Cost of Non-Europe'' _ the cost of not having unified the
economy of the Community yet. In addition to Cecchini's own Italy,
members include Britain, France, West Germany, Belgium, Holland,
Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal and Greece.
   Together, these countries have as many people as the United
States. Turkey has also asked to join, and Community officials say
Norway, Sweden and Austria are possibilities. The European Common
Market program is conducted under the auspices of the Community.
   Cecchini noted that in some matters the Community already has
more unity than the United States. For example, a doctor licensed
in one of the 12 countries is qualified to practice in all of them,
unlike the rules here which differ from state to state.
   Next month Cecchini will start publishing more than 6,000 pages
of research. He said his study has found that European economic
gains from greater unification could be worth more than $300
billion and prices paid by consumers could be 6 percent less than
in a divided continent.
   ``Five million new jobs would cover half of Europe's unemployed,
or all the young unemployed,'' he added.
   He also cited the example of Japanese auto exporters, whose
sales to Italy are limited under a quota imposed by the Italian
government. The effort is now being made to ``Europeanize'' this
quota, so that Japanese sales could go to any of the 12 countries
on the same terms. Community officials emphasized there would have
to be some hard bargaining with Japan first.
   Michael Calingaert is a State Department official on leave to
study the European effort for the National Planning Association, a
private group. He said the European plans are moving ahead fast.
   ``In 1957 industrialists were frightened of the possible results
and opposed it,'' he said. ``Now they are in favor.''
   He said the private sector is acting as if the effort will
succeed, and that attitude could be self-fulfilling.
   The idea of a unified Europe, which dates back centuries, got a
boost after World War II when Americans held up the economic
advantages of a ``common market'' like that of the United States.
West European countries had to organize themselves to distribute
the U.S. aid offered in the Marshall Plan, and began to eliminate
import quotas in trade with one another.
   In 1957 six of the present 12 members signed the Treaty of Rome,
pledging the removal of all barriers among them. Progress has been
slow.
   ``Now things are accelerating,'' Cecchini said.
   ``Six months ago nobody was even talking about a central bank
for the Community. Now the prospect is that the summit meeting in
Hanover (West Germany) in June will set up a study of something
like the U.S. Federal Reserve system.''

<HEAD>Mystery of the Missing Nuclear Scientist Captivates Taiwan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The disappearance of a leading nuclear
scientist has Taiwanese fuming at the United States and worrying
about damage to their national security.
   Newspapers carried unconfirmed reports after Col. Chang Hsien-yi
vanished in mid-January that he worked for the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency and might have turned over nuclear secrets to
the Americans.
   Chang was a deputy director of the official Institute of Nuclear
Energy Research. He disappeared while on leave from his post.
   ``We immediately looked at this map, maybe he fell off a
cliff,'' said Liu Kuang-chi, secretary general of the government
Atomic Energy Council, as he moved to an office wall map of Taiwan
and traced a route along rugged interior roads.
   But several local newspapers provided a different scenario for
Chang's disappearance, reporting that he was a CIA informant who
left for the United States with details about a Taiwanese nuclear
weapons program.
   A U.S. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis E. Oakley said in
Washington last month that the department had no comment on whether
Chang was an informant for the United States.
   In Taipei, David Hess, spokesman for the American Institute of
Taiwan, which oversees U.S. interests here, has told the government
and local media the institute has no idea of what happened to Chang.
   Taiwan officials have repeatedly denied plans to build a nuclear
bomb. Communist China has said the production of atomic weapons by
Taiwan would be reason to invade the island, which Beijing regards
as a renegade province.
   Nevertheless, the uproar over Chang has increased anti-American
sentiment that already was brewing here because of Washington's
tough trade talk with Taiwan, which last year had a record $16
billion trade surplus with the United States.
   Although the United States in 1979 broke diplomatic relations
with Taiwan and recognized the Communist China government,
Washington remains the island's major trade partner and arms
supplier. The American Institute of Taiwan serves as an operative
diplomatic and commercial link in the absence of an embassy.
   ``I get a lot of hot reaction from my students,'' said Su Chi, a
member of the Institute of International Relations who also teaches
at National Chengchi University. ``Until this point there's always
been a huge reservoir of good will toward the United States ... but
I think the reservoir has cracked.''
   The Taiwan media, which has given intense coverage to Chang's
disappearance, also has criticized the United States.
   A March 25 commentary in the mass-circulation China Times said
that no matter what the motive, ``the act of stealing our defense
secrets has invaded our national sovereignty and respect to a
certain degree. ... No one can interpret this as friendly
behavior.''
   Taiwan officials now believe Chang is in Washington. They have
asked the United States for information about him but the Reagan
administration claims it does not know his whereabouts.
   Deputy Foreign Minister John Chang recently said Taiwan cannot
lodge a protest with the United States because ``we don't have
evidence showing U.S. government or CIA involvement.''
   But Jaw Shau-kong, a maverick lawmaker from the governing
Nationalist Party, is demanding retaliatory action.
   The government ``probably should expel some (U.S.) diplomats
from Taiwan, expel some CIA; it cannot keep silent,'' said Jaw, who
views the United States as an imperialist nation.
   Jaw said he fears Chang took important military secrets,
possibly classified information about Taiwan's missile development
program. Jaw added that he wonders if such material could fall into
the hands of Communist China.
   Liu, the nuclear energy official, noted that many of Chang's
classmates worked on missile and airplane projects at the
military-run Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology.
   The government maintains, however, Chang did not take any
sensitive information from Chungshan. Liu believes the missing
scientist did not have access to such secrets even though he knew
of work done by the Nuclear Energy Research Center staff for
military-related Chungshan projects.
   Professor Su believes Chang's disappearance is unlikely to cause
a serious re-evaluation of Taiwanese-U.S. relations but could
eventually lead to public debate of the country's nuclear policy.
   In early April, the mass-circulation United Daily News newspaper
published a poll that indicated Taiwan was split over the
development of nuclear weapons.
   According to the survey, 35 percent of the 767 people polled by
telephone said Taiwan should make atomic bombs while 34 percent
were against such a policy. The poll, with a margin of error of 3.5
percentage points, indicated most people believe Taiwan is capable
of making the weapons.
   Nearly three-fourths of the respondents said that if Taiwan
developed nuclear weapons they should not be used against mainland
China.

   Here is a chronology of developments in the
Persian Gulf since last May, when the attack on the USS Stark and
the reflagging of Kuwaiti oil tankers by the United States brought
increased attention to American activity in that area.
   
   May 17 _ U.S. frigate Stark is attacked in the gulf by an Iraqi
warplane; 37 crew members die. U.S. officials term the attack a
mistake by the Iraqi pilot.
   
   May 19 _ President Reagan says the Stark tragedy ``must never be
repeated'' and says U.S. forces in the gulf will have more leeway
to protect themselves from military threats.
   
   May 21 _ U.S. Coast Guard issues waivers of U.S. maritime law to
allow speedy reflagging of Kuwaiti tankers under U.S. colors.
   
   May 29 _ Pentagon officials report a major U.S. military buildup
in the gulf is planned to protect Kuwaiti tankers.
   
   June 16 _ Maritime executives say Iran is mining the gulf.
   
   June 18 _ The White House characterizes the threat to U.S.
personnel in the gulf as ``low to moderate.'' House Armed Services
Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., says Navy is underestimating
threat from mines.
   
   July 1 _ U.S. specialists aboard a four-boat Arab mine-sweeping
flotilla remove 10 to 12 mines near Kuwaiti ports.
   
   July 3 _ Administration postpones plans to send U.S.
mine-sweeping helicopters to the gulf, deciding to rely on the Arab
ships.
   
   July 9 _ Iranian gunboat attacks U.S.-flagged tanker Peconic
with rocket-propelled grenades. Tanker is set afire but no one is
injured.
   
   July 18-20 _ Reflagging of Kuwaiti tankers begins.
   
   July 19 _ U.S., Saudi and Kuwaiti teams complete month-long
mine-sweeping operation in channel leading to Kuwaiti oil terminal.
   
   July 21 _ U.S. convoy operations begin.
   
   July 24 _ Reflagged supertanker Bridgeton hit by ``very large
explosion'' after striking mine in narrow channel near Farsi
Island. U.S. military sources say U.S. mine sweeping capability in
gulf is ``virtually nil.''
   
   July 26 _ Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger says U.S.
mine-sweeping capability in gulf will be improved. Over next 10
days, mine sweepers are dispatched along with the helicopter
carrier Guadalcanal, carrying mine detecting choppers.
   
   July 31 _ U.S. Navy helicopter crashes in gulf, killing four
crewmen.
   
   Aug. 7 _ Lawsuit filed by 114 members of Congress seeking to
invoke the War Powers Act, under which U.S. commitment in gulf

Administration denies that gulf situation meets the act's
``imminent danger'' test.
   
   Aug. 8 _ U.S. Navy F-14 Tomcat fighter fires two missiles at
Iranian jet approaching an unarmed U.S. surveillance plane. Both
missiles miss but Iranian jet retreats.

international waters.''
   
   Oct. 1 _ Iraqi war planes fire a missile at a shrimp boat and
kill its Australian captain.
   
   Oct. 2 _ Iraqi jets firing Exocet missiles set ablaze a Cypriot
tanker, one of 16 chartered by Iran. The number of vessels attacked
or damaged by Iraqi and Iranian forces stands at 375 since their
war began seven years earlier.
   
   Oct. 3 _ Low-flying aircraft scare off Iranian speedboats from a
joint Kuwaiti-Saudi Arabian oil port.

boats after an American observation helicopter is fired on. Two of
six Iranian crewmen picked out of gulf waters later die. In the
Senate, calls accelerate to invoke the War Powers Act.
   
   Oct. 9 _ Pentagon says Iran appears to have U.S.-made Stinger
anti-aircraft missiles; Senate refuses to kill a move to invoke the
War Powers Act. Reagan says using the act would mean ``535
secretaries of state.''
   
   Oct. 11 _ Iraq severely damages a Liberian-flagged supertanker;
two crewmen are killed.
   
   Oct. 16 _ Iranian missile hits Kuwaiti ship flying the U.S.

in the first direct attack on the tanker fleet guarded by the
United States.
   
   Oct. 19 _ U.S. warships destroy two Iranian oil platforms in the
Persian Gulf in retaliation. Reagan calls it a prudent response.
Says Weinberger: ``We do not seek further confrontation with Iran
but will be prepared to meet any further military escalation by
Iran with stronger retaliation. We consider this matter is now
closed.'' But Vice President George Bush says, ``Nobody thinks that
this will end it.''
   
   Oct. 20 _ The Navy resumes convoy operations for reflagged
tankers. Iran vows it will make the U.S. ``regret'' the shelling of
the oil platforms.
   
   Oct. 22 _ An Iranian Silkworm missile strikes Kuwait's offshore
supertanker oil terminal, starting a fire and wounding several
people.

``fine tuning'' of the American presence.
   
   Feb. 18 _ Mine-sweeping Stallion helicopters are withdrawn as
the USS Okinawa leaves the gulf.
   
   March 6 _ U.S. helicopters draw heavy machine gun fire from an
oil platform and small boats in the central gulf, but do not return
fire.
   
   March 9 _ Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci says the United
States is examining options for helping non-U.S. flagged vessels in
the area.

launch pads for missiles on an island in the Gulf.
   
   April 1 _ A Defense Department spokesman announces that the Navy
has found and destroyed 41 mines since sweeping operations began.
   
   April 14 _ The USS Samuel B. Roberts strikes a mine, seriously
damaging the frigate. Ten American sailors are injured.
   
   April 18 _ American forces strike two Iranian oil platforms to
punish Iran for the mine attack. In response, two Iranian navy
frigates fire missiles at U.S. aircraft, and an Iranian guided
missile patrol boat fires on the cruiser Wainwright. The frigates
were attacked and heavily damaged by U.S. forces and the patrol
boat was sunk, the Pentagon said. Officials say the Wainwrights was
not damaged.

   Critics of the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning
medium-range missiles should be satisfied with Soviet assurances
the pact covers both existing missiles and future weapons using
exotic technologies, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee says.
   The State Department told the committee on Monday that the
Soviet position was spelled out last week in a conversation between
Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   The dispute centers on the treaty signed Dec. 8 by President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, eliminating nuclear
missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles.
   The Reagan administration said the treaty banned both existing
missiles and any ``futuristic'' weapons, such as those using lasers
or beam rays, as long as the weapons had a range covered by the
treaty.
   But critics, including members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, questioned whether the Soviets might have a different
view of the treaty and suggested that the ambiguity should be
cleared up.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, said Shevardnadze's ``unequivocal statement
should allay concerns that have been raised about this subject.''
   Pell's committee sent the full Senate a report Monday that said
the Senate should approve the treaty and protect its constitutional
rights by blocking presidential attempts to change the way treaties
are interpreted.
   The 515-page report sums up the panel's three months of hearings
and its votes on the historic pact.
   The report was approved by the same 17-2 majority which
recommended two weeks ago that the treaty should be ratified by the
full Senate. The opposition votes were cast by Sens. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., and Larry Pressler, R-S.D.
   Ratification requires a vote of 67 of the 100 senators. Leaders
of both parties estimate that 90 or more senators will support the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty when it finally comes to a
vote.
   Publication of the committee report means the way is finally
clear for formal consideration on the Senate floor.
   Republicans say the most contentious issue will likely be the
Democratic-backed amendment that would bar the United States from
changing the interpretation of the INF treaty.
   The amendment, approved 12-7 by the committee, arises from a
fight over the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   Reagan has asserted that the White House can unilaterally change
how the ABM pact is viewed, a move that would permit expanded
``Star Wars'' testing, but congressional Democrats dispute that
claim.
   ``A presidential right to adopt a different interpretation of a
treaty, irrespective of the understanding on which the Senate based
its consent, would tend to nullify the Senate's share of the treaty
power and thus undermine a basic provision of the Constitution,''
the report said.
   ``The Senate's only recourse, to prevent its share of the treaty
power being nullified, would be to attach elaborate and numerous
conditions to treaties in order to have the Senate's understanding
become an integral and explicit part of the ratification
documents,'' the report said.
   ``Such procedures could easily overburden the treaty process to
the point of paralysis,'' it warned.

   The nation's community colleges meet
ambivalence about their role and often ``receive the state's budget
leftovers'' when they can be of great help both to their
neighborhoods and the nation, an educational commission said today.
   ``The community college, at its best, can be a center for
problem-solving in adult illiteracy or the education of the
disabled,'' said a report by the Commission on the Future of
Community Colleges. ``It can also be the place where education and
business leaders meet to talk about the problems of displaced
workers.
   ``It can bring together agencies to strengthen services for
minorities, working women, single parent heads of households and
unwed teenage parents. ... The community college can take the lead
in long-range planning for community development and it can serve
as the focal point for improving the quality of life in the inner
city.''
   Community colleges enroll 43 percent of the nation's
undergraduates and 51 percent of all first-time freshmen, but the
schools ``encounter ambivalence in the larger community about their
role and mission, and competing priorities within the college,''
the report said.
   Such schools ``are threatened by excessive fragmentation and
division'' and increasing cultural separations and racial tensions,
the report said.
   ``We propose therefore, that the theme `Building Communities'
become the new rallying point for the community college in America.
We define the term `community' not only as a region to be served
but also as a climate to be created.''
   The commission was headed by Ernest L. Boyer, former U.S.
commissioner of education and president of the Carnegie Foundation
for the Advancement of Teaching. It conducted the study for the
American Association of Community and Junior Colleges.
   The panel said community colleges must help solve the dropout
problem or minority students will continue to leave. It recommended
that every college develop an aggressive outreach plan for
disadvantaged students.
   Among other recommendations:
   _ An ``early warning system'' to spot and help students who are
at risk of dropping out.
   _ Each community college should commit itself to recruiting and
retaining a top-quality faculty and increase the percentage of
members who are black, Hispanic and Asian.
   _Careful assessment of reading, writing and mathematical ability
of all first-time community college students and an intensive
developmental education program for those who need it.
   _Completion of a core curriculum by all associate degree
students.

<HEAD>Judge Debates Whether Flawed Ban Is Better Than No Ban At All</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge says he must decide whether to
approve a flawed consent decree regulating all-terrain vehicles or
do nothing to regulate the vehicles blamed for 900 deaths in five
years.
   ``Is it best to move in the direction of doing what one can do
to reduce it as opposed to doing nothing about it?'' U.S. District
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said after a hearing on a proposed
out-of-court settlement between the Consumer Product Safety
Commission and five manufacturers.
   Opponents of the consent decree argued at Monday's hearing that
the agreement between federal regulators and manufacturers is
flawed because it doesn't provide for refunds to people who
purchased the vehicles, popularly known as ATVs.
   Lawyers for consumer groups and 32 states said the consent
decree also fails to protect children from the hazards of the
four-wheel machines, particularly smaller models marketed for
children, which would still be sold.
   ``We don't believe these child-sized ATVs should be sold at
all,'' said Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon, who
called ATVs ``some of the most dangerous consumer products sold in
this country.''
   The decree would ban future sales of three-wheel ATVs unless the
manufacturers devised performance standards that would be approved
by the CPSC. It would also require warning labels on four-wheel
models and distributors would have to offer training about the safe
use of the machines to owners of vehicles currently in use.
   Gesell appeared troubled by the decree's ban on further action
by the CPSC against ATVs during the 10-year period the agreement is
in effect.
   ``The mechanism provided by Congress is stymied by the consent
decree,'' Gesell told a lawyer for the manufacturers.
   ``As I understand the decree, the agency represented here _ CPSC
_ is not able to issue a rule under the statute which would be in
many respects more severe'' than the sanctions imposed by the
consent decree, Gesell said.
   ``You take the agency out of the game, you can't tell me with
quite the same assurance the agency is going to continue to perform
its function,'' the judge said.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who is sponsoring legislation to
force manufacturers to give refunds, called that provision ``a wolf
in sheep's clothing.''
   The senator urged Gesell to modify the decree to give the agency
the option of taking further action after a year or 18 months if
the agreement has not led to safer use of ATVs.
   But Justice Department attorney Stephen Hart said the agreement
allows the government to avoid a lengthy court battle during which
it would be difficult to prove the allegations that the ATVs are an
``imminent hazard'' as defined by the consumer protection statute.
   ``This is an outstanding resolution of the matter in light of
the facts as they exist and the law as it exists,'' Hart told
Gesell. ``The government will get some of what it asked for, the
other alternative is the government will get none of what it asked
for.''
   Gesell also expressed concern about the mechanics for
supervising the decree's enforcement, saying he was particularly
dismayed that it empowered the CPSC's general counsel to extend
deadlines.
   Nevertheless, the judge said the unprecedented decree could be
``a technique that could be of great value to consumers.''

<HEAD>Bill Passes to Ban Common Barnacle Blocker</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate has some bad news for boat owners
who hate to scrape barnacles off the hull.
   The chamber gave voice-vote approval Monday to legislation to
regulate the use of tributyltin, or TBT, a hull paint additive that
is effective against barnacles but poses dangers to other marine
life.
   The bill would ban the use of paints containing TBT on vessels
under 82 feet in length and would impose limits on the amount of
TBT that can be released into the water from hull paint on larger
vessels.
   The restrictions would last until the Environmental Protection
Agency decides on an environmentally safe release rate for paints
containing TBT, which have been regulated by England and France
because of damage to shellfish.
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said TBT ``is without a doubt the most
effective anti-fouling compound yet developed, and it cannot be
matched for preventing the attachment of barnacles, algae and other
marine organisms that hasten the decay of wood and cause drag on
boats.
   ``On the other hand, there is growing evidence that TBT is
extremely toxic and is affecting `non-target' marine and freshwater
organisms rather than just organisms that are trying to grow on
boat hulls.''
   He said TBT produces toxic effects in some marine organisms at
exposures of less than 100 parts per trillion _ ``the equivalent to
one drop of water in 100,000 tanker trucks of liquid.''
   Chafee said TBT's effects on humans are not known, although high
levels of the substance have been found in some chinook salmon by
federal researchers.
   The regulatory legislation originated in the House, which now
will be asked to consider an amendment approved by the Senate.

<HEAD>Scallops Make New Bedford Nation's Richest Fish Port</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Bedford, Mass., was the nation's richest
fishing port last year thanks to a banner year for scallops,
government and industry officials say.
   Other New England fishing cities slumped because of a decrease
in fin fish such as cod and haddock, and some ports around the Gulf
of Mexico suffered from problems in the shrimp industry, analysts
said Monday.
   New Bedford led in 1987 with catches valued at $143.7 million,
up nearly 36 percent from $106 million in 1986, according to the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The 1987 figure
was a record, the agency said.
   Lee Weddig, executive vice president of the National Fisheries
Institute, a trade association, attributed New Bedford's big
increase to strong scallop harvests and scallop price increases.
   NOAA said scallops accounted for nearly half of New Bedford's
total dollar value, but made up only 21 percent of the port's catch
in weight.
   Alaskan ports also enjoyed a profitable year. Kodiak was second
to New Bedford with catches valued at $132.1 million, up from $89.8
million, and Dutch Harbor-Unalaska was up from $37.2 million to
$62.7 million, NOAA reported.
   Weddig said the healthy Pacific Northwest industry was due to
strong salmon and crab harvests and a sharp increase in exports due
to the fall of the dollar overseas.
   Nationwide, foreign sales in 1987 were more than $2 billion, up
from $1.6 billion the previous year, according to Weddig.
   Texas and Louisiana ports suffered from falling shrimp
production and prices, he said.
   Cameron, La., led the nation for the 10th consecutive year in
the amount of fish caught, NOAA reported. Cameron landings rose
from 616.8 million pounds to 672.4 million pounds, bringing it
nearly back to its 1985 level. The record was 848.2 million pounds
landed in Los Angeles in 1960.
   Pascagoula-Moss Point, Miss., was second at 391.6 million
pounds, up from 365.5 million pounds.
   More than two-thirds of the major U.S. fishing ports were up in
volume from last year, but nearly half had value decreases.
   While New Bedford enjoyed a robust year, most of the other major
New England fishing ports suffered declines in both volume and
value, according to the NOAA report.
   Down in both categories were Gloucester, Mass., Point Judith,
R.I., and Boston. Only Portland, Maine, showed increases, largely
because of the operation of the new Portland Fish Exchange, Weddig
said.
   He said decreases in cod, haddock and flounder, as well as the
emergence of the Portland exchange, led to the decline in landings
at the other New England ports.

<HEAD>Trade Lawmakers Deadlock Over Foreign Investment Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers are nearing final action on a
sweeping, 1,000-page trade bill, still uncertain if it will contain
a plan to force public disclosure by foreign investors of their
U.S. holdings.
   ``If you're interested in passing a trade bill, which I am, then
I think the best course of action is to drop the Bryant
amendment,'' Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., said Monday after
lawmakers failed to break a deadlock over the issue.
   A House-Senate panel has been stalemated for more than a month
over the amendment sponsored by Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, which
would require public disclosure of much foreign investment within
the United states.
   Exon said that dropping the plan would reduce the chance of a
presidential veto, or if President Reagan vetoes the bill anyway,
increase the chance of an override.
   He noted there already are presidential veto threats over a
separate provision that would require 60-day notice of plant
closings and large-scale layoffs.
   The foreign ownership dispute is the last unresolved controversy
in fashioning the trade bill, which House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, said could come to the floor as early as Wednesday.
   Most of the compromise provisions were drawn up by House and
Senate conferees before the congressional recess Easter week but
they left farm items, the plant closings feature and the foreign
disclosure plan until the last minute.
   Wright told reporters he was pushing for inclusion of the Bryant
provision. But he added he would not seek to attach the measure to
the trade bill if it would ``put its life in jeopardy.''
   The speaker said that if conferees would not accept the plan ``I
would be inclined to give Bryant a run on its own merits'' by
bringing it to the House floor later as a separate bill.
   Under the plan, foreign investors would be required to register
with the Commerce Department if they owned 5 percent or more of any
American company or real estate in this country if such assets were
worth at least $5 million.
   Some of this information already must be filed with the
department but is not public record. That would change under
Bryant's plan.
   Companies with a 25 percent share in a U.S. business or property
with assets or annual sales of more than $20 million would have to
disclose much of the detailed information required of corporations
by the Securities and Exchange Commission on its 10-K form. The
items range from a list of directors and officers to a financial
balance sheet.
   Critics say the measure would reduce new capital from overseas
that helps prime the U.S. economic pump; proponents say it would
put a spotlight on foreign investment that could be harmful to
American interests.
   Most lawmakers believe the trade bill itself will clear both the
House and Senate without much difficulty. The question is whether
it will get the two-thirds support it would need for a veto
override.
   Three major petroleum industry associations called on Reagan to
sign the bill because it would repeal the windfall profits tax on
oil companies.
   ``We cannot allow the stagnation of domestic oil exploration and
production to continue,'' the groups said in a letter.
   The letter was sent by the American Petroleum Institute, the
Independent Petroleum Association of America and the Midcontinent
Gas and Oil Association.

<HEAD>Insurance Fund Deficit Poses No Threat To Depositors, Board Member
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the officials who oversee the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. says the near doubling of the
fund's deficit did not threaten depositors' money in the country's
3,126 federally insured savings and loans.
   ``No one has ever lost a dime in an insured deposit and no one
ever will lose a dime,'' Federal Home Loan Bank Board member
Lawrence White said Monday. ``Congress has spoken to that.''
   The board oversees the S&L deposit insurance fund, which insures
deposits up to $100,000.
   Bank board officials said the estimated costs of closing or
merging ailing S&Ls totaled $11.6 billion more than the fund's
assets at the end of 1987. That figure compares with a deficit of
$6.3 billion at the end of 1986.
   Bank board officials conceded that even this sharply higher
figure was disputed by congressional auditors, who contend it is
too low.
   The deficit figure underscores the problems facing the S&L
industry, where hundreds of institutions are insolvent but are kept
open because the government cannot afford to close them and pay off
depositors.
   The new report estimated it will cost $15.3 billion to close or
sell 204 savings and loans which are considered to be in the worst
shape.
   When $3.7 billion in fund assets are subtracted from the $15.3
billion in expected liabilities, FSLIC is left with an estimated
deficit of $11.6 billion.
   However, the figure of 204 insolvent S&Ls represents only the
worst financial cases. Another 306 institutions were also insolvent
at the end of the year under generally accepted accounting
principles.
   The FSLIC report estimated that if all of these institutions had
to be rescued, it would add another $6.5 billion to the amount of
money the insurance fund will be obligated to pay out.
   White defended the $6.5 billion estimate, saying not all of the
additional S&Ls will actually need assistance and the institutions
representing the biggest drain on the funds had already been
included in the first group of 204 S&Ls.
   However, critics contend that a figure of around $30 billion is
a much more reasonable estimate and that the costs could climb as
high as $60 billion for solving the industry's problems, far above
the amount approved by Congress last year.
   In August, President Reagan signed legislatio to pump $10.8
billion into FSLIC over the next three years through the sale of
bonds which will be paid off by a special assessment on profitable
institutions.
   There have been reports that the Reagan administration is
beginning to study alternative methods of financing because of the
threat the soaring FSLIC deficit poses to efforts to reduce the
overall federal budget deficit.
   The ideas being considered reportedly range from merging FSLIC
with the healthy Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures
funds at banks, or tapping into the money generated each year by
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., popularly known as Freddie
Mac, which Congress created in 1970 to funnel money from investors
to home buyers.
   Freddie Mac president Leland C. Brendsel said that diverting his
company's income stream to assist FSLIC ``is an idea that doesn't
stand up to financial scrutiny.''
   White said it was premature to consider major changes to get
more money for FSLIC.
   He said that the S&L fund will have $20 billion at its disposal
over the next three years and that this amount would be sufficient
to deal with the worst problems facing the industry. He said the
new president would have plenty of time to study what further
resources would be needed.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson told a business group he favors
continued research on the Star Wars missile defense system and then
told an East Harlem audience a few hours later: ``We do not need
Star Wars. We need decent housing and education and day care.''
   Robert Borosage, a top adviser to Jackson's presidential
campaign, said the former civil rights activist has always
supported research on Star Wars. But it was not until the New York
primary campaign that Jackson began to readily discuss his support
for that research.
   ``Keep the research; we don't need to deploy it,'' Jackson told
the Association for a Better New York, an organization of business
and civic leaders, a few hours before his East Harlem appearance.
   An even more publicized shift in position was Jackson's
statement that he would not meet with Yasser Arafat, the leader of
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Ten years ago, Jackson embraced Arafat at a meeting that became
a focus of Jewish opposition to his candidacy.
   During an interview on the CBS show, ``Face the Nation,''
Jackson said Arafat was an ``extreme element'' in the Middle East
and that it would be a mistake to negotiate with him.
   On the same program, Jackson said he had no plans to scrap
existing weapons in the U.S. arsenal, including many he opposed in
the past.
   Is Jackson shifting toward the mainstream as he has become a
credible challenger to Michael Dukakis' claim on the Democratic
presidential nomination?
   Ann Lewis, a top Jackson adviser, called the shifts part of a
``two-way evolution.''
   She said that as Jackson has been taken more seriously as a
presidential candidate he has been asked more substantive policy
questions and they have forced him to re-examine many of his views.
   ``His position on Star Wars has been the same since Reagan
launched it,'' said Borosage. But he conceded the candidate's
stance on any Arafat role in Middle East negotiations has changed.
   ``He believes you've got to deal with the PLO,'' said Borosage.
But, he added, Jackson also has come to believe that Arafat is too
``inciteful'' to be included in peace negotiations.
   Jackson has explained his earlier meeting with Arafat as an
effort to persuade the PLO leader to accept Israel's right to
exist. He repeatedly told New York audiences that Israel must be
guaranteed secure borders. He also has advocated an independent
Palestinian state.
   In the CBS interview, Jackson also denied having advocated
elimination of such systems as the MX missile.
   ``We've got to keep the systems we have,'' said Jackson.
   In a letter published in Monday's New York Times, Borosage took
issue with a story on Jackson's views that had appeared in the
newspaper.
   ``Mr. Jackson has never stated he `would scrap a range of
weapons systems' already deployed,'' wrote Borosage.
   However he went on to say that the candidate would oppose
further development of the Stealth bomber ``because we have just
spent billions purchasing the B-1 for the same mission.''
   In speeches, Jackson advocates a freeze in the military budget.

   Here are highlights from the report by the

   _ The nation's air transportation system is ``safe, for now,''
but the government regulatory structure ``designed to ensure
aviation safety is inadequate to deal with future growth and
technological change.''
   _ A ``major structural overhaul'' of the Federal Aviation
Administration is needed, making it an independent agency outside
the Transportation Department.
   _ An independent aviation ``safety czar'' should be appointed as
part of the new FAA and given authority to oversee safety matters.
With a seven-year term, the new aviation safety director could
initiate new safety rules and block proposed regulations.
   _ No need has been demonstrated for re-imposing federal
regulation of the airline industry, although the government must
streamline its regulatory activities to deal with rapidly changing
events in a deregulated industry.
   _ Surveillance of airlines should be improved with heavier
reliance on in-depth inspections, surprise inspections and closer
examination of airlines undergoing major changes.
   _ Safety requirements for commuter airlines should elevated
gradually to the same level as those for larger commercial airlines.
   _ Small private planes flying near major airports should be
required to have equipment that informs ground controllers of their
altitude.

<HEAD>Farm Prices Rise, But Farm Share Of Retail Food Prices Drops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm prices of food commodities averaged
higher in 1987 after declining for two years, and retail grocery
prices rose even faster, says an Agriculture Department report.
   So, for the third straight year farmers got a declining share of
the consumer food dollar _ an average of 29 percent, or 29 cents
out of every dollar spent at grocery stores for a market-basket
list of food items.
   The farm value share of the retail price of food in the market
basket has declined at least one percentage point each year _ a
penny of each dollar spent _ since it averaged 34 percent, or 34
cents, in the 1984 calendar year.
   According to USDA records going back to 1913, when farmers got
46 percent of the food dollar, the annual share has been at record
low levels the last three years _ 31 percent in 1985, 30 percent in
1986 and 29 percent in 1987.
   Previously, the low mark was a farm value share of 32 percent
during 1932 and 1933 in the depths of the Depression. It rose to
more than 50 percent during World War II and for a few years after.
   With 29 percent of the retail cost of market basket going to
farmers, that means the remaining 71 percent went to those who
handle raw food products after they leave the farm.
   The market basket contains average quantities of domestically
produced food bought in grocery stores, excluding non-alcoholic
beverages, and fish and seafood.
   Department economists use several basic components to describe
what happens to the market basket each year:
   _Farm value represents prices farmers receive for the raw
commodities equivalent to foods in the market basket.
   _The farm-to-retail price spread is the difference between the
retail price and the farm value. The price spread is the charge for
processing, distributing and retailing foods.
   _The farm value share is the proportion the farmer gets from the
amount consumers spend on market-basket food sold in grocery stores.
   In 1987, the department's Economic Research Service said Monday
in its annual report, the farm value of food increased 2.7 percent.
But the retail store price of the market basket rose 5 percent, and
the price spread increased 6 percent.
   That caused the farm value share to decline again _ to the
record low of 29 percent.
   While useful as an indicator to track where consumer food
dollars go, the market basket does not tell the overall story. For
example, the agency said that food prices overall _ including all
items eaten at home and away from home _ rose an average of 4.1
percent in 1987, compared with 3.2 percent in 1986.
   That was the sharpest annual increase since 1981, and included a
4.3 percent gain for grocery prices and 4 percent for food eaten
away from home.
   ``Food prices rose more at supermarkets and other grocery stores
than at eating places for the first time in nine years,'' the
report said.
   Looking further at the market basket, economists said the farm
share declined to 29 percent ``because abundant food supplies held
down farm prices while rising food processing and distributing
charges'' forced up prices at retail stores.
   ``The size of the farm value share is not a direct measure of
the welfare of producers, but a shortrun decrease often accompanies
a decline in farm income,'' the report said. ``Last year, net farm
income increased, but mainly because of higher government
payments.''

   An additional 175,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat has been sold to the Soviet Union at subsidized prices under
an Agriculture Department export program.
   The sale, equal to about 6.42 million bushels, was handled by
Artfer Inc., 100,000 tons; and Continental Grain Co., 75,000.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Monday the grain was sold under
terms of the long-term grain agreement between the United States
and the Soviet Union.
   Sims said the subsidies averaged $24.46 per ton, or about 67
cents per bushel of wheat.
   No selling prices were announced, but wheat has been averaging
about $2.85 per bushel recently, according to the USDA. That could
mean a farm value of about $18 million.
   The pact, which expires Sept. 30, calls on Moscow to buy at
least 9 million tons of grain annually and specifies that the
purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and
corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million
tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting
as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat or soybeans.
   So far, the Soviets have bought more than 8.6 million tons of
subsidized wheat for delivery in the fifth year, as well as 4.1
million tons of non-subsidized corn; 818,400 tons of U.S. soybeans;
and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.
   Subsidies are provided under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP. Private exporters are given surplus commodities
owned by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. so they can sell a
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodities at competitive
world prices.
   Sims said the Soviets have only 10,200 tons remaining in their
current EEP authorization, which was announced on April 4.

   Sheep producers will soon receive about $90
million in federal price support payments for wool marketed in
1987, the Agriculture Department says.
   The payments are adjusted to help make up the difference between
the announced support of $1.81 per pound of 1987 wool and the
average market price, which was 91.7 cents per pound.
   Mohair payments to goat producers will total about $40 million,
reflecting a 1987 support of $4.95 per pound and a 1987 average
market price of $2.63 per pound, officials said Monday.

   Presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson
headed into today's New York primary with a new win in his column _
in Delaware's Democratic caucuses, where he handily beat rival
Michael Dukakis.
   With all 41 precincts reporting, Jackson had 86.5 delegates for
45 percent, Dukakis had 51.5 delegates for 27 percent and Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had four delegates for 2 percent.
   Forty-seven delegates were uncommitted for 25 percent. The
delegates selected will attend the state convention May 23, where
Delaware's 15 national convention delegates will be chosen.
   Based on the results, Jackson picked up seven delegates, Dukakis
five and three are uncommitted.
   The Delaware caucuses were overshadowed by today's New York
contest, with its primary prize of 255 delegates.
   Jackson had been organized statewide in Delaware for several
months, while Dukakis opened shop about three weeks ago. Gore has
no organization in the state.
   Before the caucuses, there had been predictions that Jackson
supporters would turn out in force. Samuel L. Shipley, the state
party chairman, predicted a heavy turnout, spurred by a Jackson
organizing drive.
   Jackson coordinator Vivian Houghton said Jackson supporters in
the state were ``fervent and committed.''
   Caucuses were being held in 41 state representative districts to
select 189 delegates to the state convention. Candidates had to win
at least 15 percent of the vote to receive a share of the delegates.
   Party leaders have stayed neutral since favorite son Sen. Joseph
Biden Jr. dropped out of the race in September.
   Biden called it quits in a campaign rocked by charges he
plagiarized in law school, plagiarized speeches and exaggerated his
academic credentials.
   Republican caucuses began April 5 and will continue until April
25 to select delegates to the GOP state convention, scheduled for
May 14.

<HEAD>Industry-Funded Study Says Canadian Power Imports Save Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Harvard University study strongly endorses
Canadian electricity imports as a cheap alternative to Mideast oil
and rejects a proposal from the domestic coal industry to limit the
hydroelectric power.
   The report, released Monday by the Energy and Environmental
Policy Center at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government,
dismisses arguments that Canadian producers have unfair advantages
over domestic utilities.
   It also dismisses assertions that reliance on Canadian imports
could leave the United States vulnerable, and that government
subsidies and lower environmental standards make the exports
possible.
   Instead, it says, Canadian utilities can export hydroelectric
power at a cheaper price than it costs to build new coal facilities
because of Canada's vast water resources.
   ``Arguments about Canadian subsidies, lax environmental
standards and national security implications are not only often
factually wrong, but also divert attention from the real public
policy issue,'' said Henry Lee, executive director of the center
and co-author of the study.
   ``If Canada has greater access to inexpensive natural resources,
should the U.S. federal government limit the ability of U.S.
consumers to purchase those resources?'' Lee asked.
   The Harvard researchers estimated that the 35,300 gigawatt hours
of Canadian electricity purchased by the United States in 1986
would increase by 1995 to between 52,000 and 63,000 gigawatt hours.
A gigawatt is a billion watts.
   Canadian power imports represent only 2 percent of U.S.
consumption nationwide, but they account for about 10 percent of
the electricity used in New England and New York.
   The $75,000 study was paid in large part by utilities that
benefit from Canadian imports.
   Lee said buying large chunks of Canadian power does not pose a
national security risk since it is unlikely Canada would cut off
electricity for political reasons.
   ``The security costs of any practically attainable level of
Canadian imports are far outweighed by the national security
benefits which accrue to the United States from reducing oil
imports'' from Mideast nations, the report said.
   Rep. Nick Joe Rahall II, D-W.Va., countered, ``Political
relationships are volatile with changes in leadership, and in no
way can we use today's stable relationship (with Canada) as a basis
for the future.''
   Rahall, chairman of the House Interior subcommittee on mining
and natural resources, introduced legislation last year that would
prohibit Canadian power imports unless they adhered to
environmental safeguards similar to those in the United States.
   The study also said that Canadian imports displace mostly
imported oil and domestic natural gas, not coal.
   If all Canadian power contracts were cancelled, the coal
industry would see a 2,479 increase in jobs, but it would cost U.S.
consumers $114,123 per job, the study said.

<TEXT>
   The government and rebel leaders
adjourned peace talks Monday without reaching agreement after four
days, but they agreed to meet again in Managua at the end of the
month.
   Gen. Humberto Ortega, the defense minister and head of the
Sandinista government's negotiating team, read a statement signed
by both parties saying they would meet in the capital April 28-30
to continue talks on a permanent truce in the 6{-year-old war.
   Adolfo Calero, a leader of the rebels known as Contras, told
reporters the two sides were ``on the road to an understanding.''
He refused to elaborate on what they discussed during the talks.
   ``This isn't an automobile race in Indianapolis to run at 200
miles per hour,'' Ortega said. ``Our interest is to negotiate the
definitive cease-fire, but it can't be reached overnight, for which
we consider that what was discussed here was an advance and not a
failure.''
   He claimed the rebels' political directorate was being pressured
to avoid signing an agreement by the Contra military chief, Enrique
Bermudez.
   ``Our army will continue clutching their rifles to dissuade the
enemies of Sapoa, and I'm referring to Enrique Bermudez and the
guerrillas, so that they don't continue sabotaging the accords,''
Ortega said. Sapoa is the town where the two sides signed a
cease-fire agreement last month.
   President Daniel Ortega, the defense minister's brother, told a
rally Monday night that the Contra political leaders should not
cave in to what he said was pressure from the United States and
Bermudez.
   Addressing thousands of Sandinista supporters in Managua's Plaza
de la Revolucion, the president claimed Bermudez had told Contra
political leaders that if they signed a truce with the government
the rebels ``would liquidate them.''
   He said if the political leaders submit ``to the pressures of
the Yankee administration and the threats of Bermudez, they would
not continue to come to Managua and if they did it would be to
break the Sapoa accords.
   ``If this happens, it would leave us no other road but to
achieve a total victory in the military field.''
   Negotiations between the rebels and government have been
deadlocked over the so-called ``democratization'' issue.
   The Sandinistas have insisted the rebels sign a permanent truce
immediately. They say Contra delegates would then be allowed to
take part in a ``national reconciliation dialogue'' with leaders of
the country's 14 legally recognized political parties.
   Contra leaders are demanding that Sandinistas first carry out a
series of democratic reforms, or at least pledge to do so.
   On Monday afternoon, Contra leader Alfredo Cesar told a cheering
crowd the rebels will press for an end to the military draft and
the release of thousands of political prisoners.
   ``We are in Managua to negotiate with the Sandinistas the
freedom of Nicaragua and the restoration of democracy and, as long
as we do not achieve this, we will not lay down our weapons,''
Cesar told about 800 supporters in the capital.
   He spoke outside La Prensa before he and other Contra leaders
visited the editors of the only opposition newspaper.
   Cesar and five directors of the rebel umbrella group, known as
the Nicaraguan Resistance, traveled to Managua on Friday to try to
negotiate with the government an end to the war that has killed an
estimated 26,500 people.
   It was the first time the Sandinistas agreed to negotiate with
their foes in the capital. The Contras' 20-minute visit to La
Prensa was their first venture outside the Camino Real Hotel where
they have been staying.
   Contra leaders visited with Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and
other Roman Catholic church officials in the afternoon and said
afterward they would free 40 government soldiers.
   ``At the request of the bishops we have decided to free the
Sandinista prisoners that we have in our power as a show of good
faith for national reconciliation,'' said Calero, highest-ranking
official in the Contra directorate.
   Official Voice of Nicaragua radio claimed the Contras had more
Sandinista prisoners and releasing only 40 was ``ridiculous in
seven years of war.''
   The two sides signed a peace agreement March 23 which provided
for a temporary cease-fire while they negotiated a permanent truce.
The 60-day cease-fire went into effect April 1.
   The Contras on Monday proposed that the temporary cease-fire be
extended another month while both sides seek agreement. There was
no immediate response from the government.
   Soon after the March 23 accord was signed, the Sandinistas freed
100 of the 3,300 political prisoners and promised to release the
rest as peace negotiations progressed.
   Among the Contra directors who visited La Prensa Monday was
Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, whose mother, Violeta Chamorro, is
publisher.
   His publisher father, also named Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, was
killed on Jan. 10, 1978. The assassination, widely blamed on the
right-wing government in power at the time, unleashed a revolt that
toppled President Anastasio Somoza and swept the Sandinistas into
power in July 1979.

<HEAD>Report Says Program Trading Pushed January 8 Market Plunge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission
believes that heavy program trading may have helped force down
stock prices last Jan. 8, the day of the third-worst market plunge.
   In a report released Monday, the SEC said it has detected high
levels of computer-driven transactions late in that day's session,
particularly in stocks frequently traded by institutional investors
using programs.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 140 points that day.
   The SEC, using information it obtained from the New York Stock
Exchange, said that 75.4 million of the 197.3 million shares traded
that day were sold after 2:30 p.m. Two-thirds of the decline
occurred after 2:30 p.m.
   ``This heavy late selling activity occurred on relatively little
fundamental economic news,'' the report said.
   The report stated that the role in the Jan. 8 plunge of
index-related trading _ transactions involving baskets of stocks
and futures _ ``was comparable to that during the week preceding
Oct. 19.''
   That was the day of the worst plunge in the stock market's
history, a 508-point Dow Jones decline.
   The study concluded that ``stock selling from index arbitrage
may have accelerated the steepest portion of the market decline''
that day after 2:30 p.m.
   Index arbitrage is a strategy by which institutional traders,
usually using computers, attempt to profit from price discrepancies
between stocks and stock index futures. It and other forms of
so-called program trading, in which computers guide huge
transactions, have been called factors in the stock market's wildly
surging price swings of recent months.
   The study said that only 13 percent of the shares traded Jan. 8
were generated by program selling.
   But more than one-third of the transactions after 2:30 p.m.
involving stocks comprising the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index
were made by program traders, the report said. Stocks in the
Standard & Poor's index are frequently bought and sold by program
traders.
   The report was released by Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.,
chairman of the House telecommunications and finance subcommittee.
Markey had requested the study, which was dated April 7 and sent to
the congressman by SEC Chairman David S. Ruder.
   ``I am deeply concerned about the impact of this continued
volatility on our capital formation process and long-term economic
growth,'' Markey said in a prepared statement.
   Markey has been working on legislation designed to control
market volatility.

   A cooperative and a factory made a tidy profit by
selling cans of air for up to $8 each, a government newspaper said.
   Izvestia on Monday ran a front-page article about sales of air
from the Black Sea port of Odessa, praising the enterprise as a
``living illustration of the possibilities of free initiative.''
   Izvestia said the state-run Odessa firm Studio was seeking
financial sponsorship for a new cooperative when it turned for help
to a factory that cans fruit, juices and jams. The factory offered
to sell thousands of cans it had purchased several years earlier
and then decided it could not use.
   The cooperative obtained the cans for 16 cents apiece,
``although it would seem the goods were completely useless,''
Izvestia said.
   The cooperative labeled the cans ``Odessa Air. Gathered on the
City's Streets During the Days of `Humor,''' and sold them on April
Fool's Day.

   Rain fell over much of the country Monday, with parts of Texas
receiving almost an inch and hail the size of golf balls, while
severe weather in Georgia damaged mobile homes and injured at least
four people.
   Showers were scattered from western Montana across the Idaho
panhandle and eastern Washington and south into western Utah.
Showers also reached from southern New England and southern New
York and along the Atlantic Coast through northern Florida.
   A possible tornado touched down about 9:45 p.m. at Bainbridge,
Ga., said Tim Merkison, a dispatcher for the Decatur County
Sheriff's Department. He said four people were hurt, though he did
not know the severity of the injuries.
   About 15 mobile homes were damaged and several trees were
uprooted, he said.
   The Ohio Valley, and parts of Texas and Louisiana also had rain.
Thunderstorms produced 0.86 inches of rain at George West, Texas,
with hail the size of golf balls west of the community and at
Beeville, Texas. Strong wind knocked down trees and limbs near
Beeville.
   Afternoon thunderstorms produced half-inch-diameter hail from
Zachary to Watson, La. In Atlanta, 0.79 inches of rain fell in six
hours Monday, with nearly as much in Ogden, Utah.
   Snowshowers continued in parts of Michigan, but the only report
of measurable snowfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
was from Mount Washington, N.H., where snow cover was 41 inches
deep at noon.
   Valentine, Neb., reached 15 degrees Monday, breaking a
32-year-old record of 17 degrees. International Falls, Minn., tied
its record, 17 degrees, set in 1960.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 27 degrees at Sault Ste.
Marie, Mich., to 92 at McAllen, Texas. The morning low was 12
degrees at both Bismarck and Fargo, N.D.
   Tuesday's forecast called for snowshowers over northern Maine
and rain scattered over parts of Florida and from Montana and
Wyoming across the northern half of the Pacific coast.
   High temperatures were expected to reach the 30s and 40s over
upper Michigan; 40s and 50s from New England and New Jersey, across
the northern Appalachians, the remainder of the Great Lakes, the
upper Mississippi Valley, the northern Plains, the upper Missouri
Valley and the northern Rockies.
   Highs in the 70s and 80s were forecast for South Carolina across
Florida and west over the central Gulf of Mexico states, the
southern Plains, the desert Southwest and the inland portions of
southern California. High in the 60s and 70s were predicted for the
rest of the nation.

   Actor James Garner has been hospitalized in
preparation for surgery to clear an obstruction restricting the
flow of blood from his heart, a spokeswoman said.
   ``He's feeling fine,'' said Garner's assistant, Maryann Rea,
adding the aneurysm was discovered during a regular checkup. ``He
wasn't sick and had no pain. Yes, it was a surprise.''
   Garner checked into Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Monday.
Surgery was scheduled for Thursday.
   During the three-hour operation, doctors will use a a balloon to
compress the aneurysm formed on the wall of the aorta, which takes
blood from the left ventrical of the heart to the body.
   Garner, 60, was expected to be hospitalized about 10 days.

   Authorities declined to press drug charges
against actor Jan-Michael Vincent after tests revealed the pills
police found on him were caffeine tablets and not illegal
amphetamines.
   The district attorney's office on Monday declined to charge
Vincent with felony possession of an amphetamine, as alleged by the
Sheriff's Department, said spokesman Andy Reynolds.
   Deputies in Agoura Hills on Wednesday stopped a car driven by
Vincent's wife because its registration had expired, authorities
said. Vincent, 42, a passenger, was arrested on suspicion of drug
possession after the 12 white tablets were found.
   Vincent, who played a tough helicopter pilot in the canceled
CBS-TV series ``Airwolf'' and won a Golden Globe nomination for his
role in the film ``Going Home,'' lives in Malibu.

truth.''
   ``Poetry is life distilled,'' said Ms. Brooks, who gave a talk
Sunday in Annapolis. ``I just write about the things that excite
me, or interest me, or just make me.''
   In six decades of writing, Ms. Brooks has turned her works to
hard-hitting topics such as Winnie Mandela's struggle in South
Africa. But she has not ignored images and meanings of life's
simpler things.
   Ms. Brooks, the 70-year-old Poet Laureate of Illinois, spoke as

Moriah African Methodist Church.
   In addition to winning the 1955 Pulitzer Prize for poetry for

   Zsa Zsa Gabor has bought a three-bedroom
house that was a wedding gift to the Prince and Princess of Wales
seven years ago, a newspaper reported.
   The royal couple spent the night at the house at the Palm Beach
Polo and Country Club on Nov. 12, 1985, but Prince Charles stayed
with friends at a nearby horse ranch when he visited last month.
   The house was given to the prince and his bride in 1981 by club
founder William Ylvisaker, but the prince never assumed the title,
the Palm Beach Post reported today.
   ``It has always been owned by the club,'' said Larry Throneburg,
the club's vice president for sales.
   Miss Gabor, who was in New York City on Monday and could not be
reached for comment, paid $275,000 for the house, $75,000 more than
she paid for a nearby house that she sold about three years ago,
the newspaper said.

   Charles ``Honi'' Coles has received the Capezio
Award, becoming the first tap dancer in the award's 37-year history
to receive one of the dance world's top honors.
   The $5,000 award was announced Monday.
   Coles, 77, started tapping on Philadelphia street corners as a
child. He danced in black vaudeville, had a partnership with Cholly
Atkins for 16 years and tapped in front of the big bands of Duke
Ellington, Count Basie, Cab Calloway, Lionel Hampton and Billy
Eckstine.
   When tap went out of style, Coles worked as production manager
at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.
   He danced on Broadway in 1949 in ``Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,''
and returned to Broadway when tap returned to favor in ``Bubblin'
Brown Sugar'' in 1976 and ``My One and Only,'' which won him a Tony
Award in 1983.

auto manufacturing capital.
   At an Economic Club of Detroit luncheon Monday, the king
recalled touring auto plants with the late Henry Ford II and
driving production and experimental cars on a test track on a
previous visit to Detroit in the 1970s.
   Detroit was the seventh stop on a 13-city, 17-day tour
commemorating the 350th anniversary of Sweden's first colony in
North America.
   King Gustaf and Queen Silvia arrived Sunday from New York and
were scheduled to leave for Chicago today.
   ``I am glad to be back in Detroit. I have always been fond of

   Top Soviet and Swedish officials signed an
agreement ending a 19-year-old dispute over fishing and exploration
rights in the 200 miles of the Baltic Sea that separates the two
countries.
   The agreement was signed Monday in Moscow by Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shervardnadze and Swedish Foreign Minister Sten
Andersson.
   Under the agreement, Sweden won the rights to 75 percent of the
area and the Soviet Union gained control of the remaining 25
percent.
   Final agreement on the package was reached during a visit to
Sweden in January by Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov. Both sides
cited the agreement as evidence of ``new thinking'' by the Soviet
Union in its foreign policy.

   The health minister criticized Astra
AB, Sweden's largest pharmaceutical company, for deciding to halt
its research into AIDS.
   ``I think the company should care more about its international
image,'' Gertrud Sigurdsen was quoted as saying by the national
news agency TT.
   Astra on Friday announced plans to abandon the research, saying
it was too expensive and the competition from the United States was
too great.
   Astra employed more than 20 scientists and invested $1.6 million
annually for five years in researching AIDS, or acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   The company said it made ``interesting progress'' in some
medicines and plans to sell its results to other companies.
   ``The government has not been able to influence the (company's)
decision, although it has supported the research,'' Sigurdsen said.

   ``Beetlejuice'' held on to No. 1 at the
nation's box offices last weekend, while ``The Last Emperor,''
which won nine Oscars last week, entered the top 10 for the first
time in its 21 weeks of release.
   ``Beetlejuice,'' starring Michael Keaton as a zany ghost that
exorcises unwanted people from homes, earned $7.1 million on 1,500
screens to keep its first place position for the third straight
week.
   ``Beetlejuice'' squeezed out ``Colors,'' which critics called
inflammatory because of its undiluted picture of gang violence in
Los Angeles.
   ``Colors'' earned $4.7 million on 422 screens for its debut week.
   The attacks on the movie and its defense by its director, Dennis
Hopper, gave it heavy publicity for nearly two weeks before it
opened Friday.
   ``Beetlejuice'' averaged $4,763 per screen while ``Colors''
$11,249.
   In third place was Neil Simon's autobiographical ``Biloxi
Blues,'' which earned $3.4 million.
   ``The Last Emperor,'' finished in fourth place last weekend,
with $3.3 million in ticket sales.
   In fifth place was Disney's ``The Man From Snowy River,'' which
earned more than $3 million in its debut week.
   ``Moonstruck,'' which won three Oscars, earned $2.9 million and
jumped from ninth to sixth place.
   In seventh place was ``The Seventh Sign,'' earning $2.7 million.
   ``Bad Dreams,'' about the haunting dreams of the only survivor
of a religious cult's mass suicide, earned $2.2 million for eighth
place.
   ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' grossed $2 million for ninth place,
followed by ``Bright Lights, Big City,'' which earned $1.8 million.

<HEAD>Court: Demjanjuk Killed People With His Hands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY SEDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of three Israeli judges who convicted John
Demjanjuk of Nazi war crimes said the death camp guard killed many
people with his own hands and often exceeded the atrocities ordered
by his superiors.
   ``He took part in the murders ... and did so willingly,
enthusiastically,'' Judge Dov Levine said of the former Ohio
autoworker during the 12-hour reading of the 450-page judgment
Monday.
   Applause broke out in the courtroom when the court ruled that
Demjanjuk was ``Ivan the Terrible,'' a guard who operated gas
chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at the Treblinka death camp in
Nazi-occupied Poland in 1942 and 1943.
   The three-judge court convicted Demjanjuk of war crimes, crimes
against the Jewish people, crimes against humanity and crimes
against persecuted people. Demjanjuk, 68, will be sentenced April
25 and could receive the death penalty.
   He was the second person to be convicted of Nazi war crimes in
Israel. Adolf Eichmann, architect of the Holocaust, was convicted
and hanged in 1962.
   ``I'm an innocent man. I will appeal and I'm sure I'll win,''
Demjanjuk told reporters as he walked slowly from the courthouse to
a police van, his head bowed and his arms clasped.
   Demjanjuk maintained his innocence through the 14-month trial,
saying he was a victim of mistaken identity.
   Demjanjuk's lawyers and relatives accused the judges of bias.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, this was nothing more than a Soviet
show trial,'' said Demjanjuk's son, John Jr. 22. He and other
family members stormed out of court in protest midway through the
reading of the judgment.
   Holocaust survivor Eliyahu Rosenberg hugged a prosecution
assistant after the verdict and exclaimed, ``I feel better now,''
said the assistant, who would not give his name. Rosenberg was one
of five Treblinka survivors who identified Demjanjuk.
   Demjanjuk heard the verdict from a cot in a courthouse cell,
where guards carried him feet first after he complained of a back
injury. Defense attorneys said he was in too much pain to sit in
the courtroom.
   In the judgment, Levine said Demjanjuk wasn't an ordinary guard,
but ``fulfilled a central position'' at Treblinka. ``With his own
hands, he took part in the murders of masses of human beings ...
showing initiative beyond what his superiors demanded of him,''
Levine said.
   Treblinka survivors have said ``Ivan'' would stand near gas
chambers and strike prisoners with a metal bar or bayonet as they
went to their deaths.
   Survivor Pinchas Epstein was helped from the courtroom in tears
after judges quoting from his testimony said Ivan ``would gloat at
the crushed faces, the blood flowing after he brutalized people.''
   Levine said the court gave great weight to the testimony of the
five survivors and rejected defense claims that the witnesses were
unreliable and suffered memory lapses.
   ``They (the witnesses) saw him day after day and followed his
every action with fear, afraid they could be one of his victims,''
Levine said. ``These experiences are deeply ingrained on their
memories, the horrors are a deep part of them.''
   The court also rejected the defense claim that the
Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk was a German prisoner of war in 1942 and
1943.
   The judges upheld a key piece of prosecution evidence,
Demjanjuk's alleged Nazi identity card, which the Soviet Union
supplied.
   The card was issued at Trawniki, a training camp for death camp
guards near Treblinka. It does not mention Treblinka, but states
that Demjanjuk was posted at the nearby Sobibor death camp.
   Defense attorneys said the card is a Soviet forgery to punish
Demjanjuk for fighting in an anti-communist unit the Nazis formed
at the end of World War II.
   But Judge Daliah Dorner said: ``We conclude the personal details
on the ID card are those of the accused.''
   Defense attorney John Gill called the trial unfair.
   ``My God in heaven, according to those judges we didn't do
anything right,'' Gill told The Associated Press. ``They ruled
against us on every single point, no matter how big or small.
Justice was not done.''
   ``This is going to go down in history as the most lopsided case
ever conducted anywhere in the world,'' added Ed Nishnic,
Demjanjuk's son-in-law who raised $650,000 for the defense.
   Jewish leaders praised the verdict.
   Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los
Angeles, said in a statement distributed in Jerusalem:
   ``There is a bitter sense of irony in that this death camp guard
determined to kill off any trace of Jewish life ... must now end
his life in the Jewish state, watching from the window the
uninterrupted growth of Jewish civilization.''
   The trial began Feb. 16, 1987, a year after Demjanjuk was
extradited to Israel from suburban Cleveland. He was stripped of
his U.S. citizenship for lying on his immigration application.

<TEXT>
   Sponsors of the Templeton Prize for Progress in
Religion postponed presenting the $369,000 prize to this year's
winner while they investigate charges that he fostered
anti-Semitism, a newspaper reported.
   Inamullah Khan, secretary-general of the World Moslem Congress,
was chosen last month to receive the award. He was the first Moslem
to win the award, which has been presented 15 times.
   The American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith protested, saying that Khan and his organization had
fostered anti-Semitism for years, The New York Times reported
Tuesday.
   Khan, 73, of Pakistan, has denied the charges and said: ``I can
never support anti-Semitic feelings because I am myself a
descendant of Semitic ancestors from the Middle East.''
   He said he differs with Zionists ``because the U.N. General
Assembly has declared Zionism a racist creed.''
   The decision to delay the presentation was announced last week,
the Times said.
   Khan's supporters say he and his organization have been more
willing than other Islamic groups to maintain contacts with Jewish
representatives in national and international settings.
   However, The Moslem World, a newsletter of the World Moslem
Congress, has published many comments critical of Jews and Zionism.
The newsletter also has advertised and endorsed ``The Protocols of
the Elders of Zion'' and Henry Ford's ``The International Jew,''
both notorious anti-Semitic tracts.
   Past recipients of the prize include Mother Teresa, the Rev.
Billy Graham and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.
   Sir John Templeton, an American-born financier living in the
Bahamas, established the prize in 1972 as a religious counterpart
to the Nobel Prizes for peace, science and literature.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo earned more as a speaker in
1987 than he did as governor, his tax returns show.
   In addition, Cuomo donated almost $90,000 of his $278,988 in
earnings last year to the state, according to the returns released
Monday.
   The Democrat's income included $134,000 from speaking
engagements and $125,988 from the state, which is slightly less
than his $130,000 gubernatorial salary because of state payroll
scheduling and tax deferring, aides said.
   He paid $44,166 in federal income taxes and $22,641 in state and
local taxes for 1987, according to the joint return filed by Cuomo
and his wife, Matilda.
   Cuomo also donated $3,855 to 14 charities.
   ``The governor's favorite charity, in this case, turns out to be
the state,'' said Cuomo spokesman Gary Fryer.
   Cuomo returned to the state $30,000 of his salary and $59,498 in
speaking engagement fees.
   Cuomo's office would not disclose the amounts organizations paid
the governor for speaking or the charities to which he contributed.
Fryer said that was at the request of some of the groups.

<TEXT>
   The signs of change were apparent as Milwaukee
prepared to swear in a new mayor for the first time in 28 years,
bidding farewell to feisty veteran Henry W. Maier and welcoming
newcomer John O. Norquist.
   Maier, whose 28-year tenure was the longest of any big-city
mayor in the nation, was scheduled to give up the office today with
the swearing in of Norquist.
   Maier, 70, a past president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and
National League of Cities, announced last year he would not seek
re-election because of his age.
   The 38-year-old Norquist, like Maier a Democrat, planned to
resign as a state senator this morning before being sworn in as
mayor.
   Aides said Monday that Norquist wants broader powers that would
enable him to hire and fire certain officials of this city of
636,000 who now have set terms of office. H. Carl Mueller, who
headed Norquist's transition team, said Gov. Tommy G. Thompson
supported proposed legislation to make the change.
   ``We were elected here with a mandate for change,'' Mueller
said. ``It would be an attempt to establish a true cabinet-style
government.''
   Norquist also said he would support naming a city viaduct in
honor of civil rights leader James Groppi, who died in 1985.
   Maier, who often found himself at odds with Groppi's protest
tactics during open-housing marches and other campaigns of the
1960s, vetoed the name-change proposal last year, and the Common
Council failed by one vote to override the veto.
   Maier, who fought for increased federal and state aid for
cities, marked his last day in office by taking a jab at a familiar
adversary: the city's afternoon newspaper.
   The mayor ran an advertisement in Monday morning's Milwaukee
Sentinel to respond to a column April 10 by Sig Gissler, editor of
The Milwaukee Journal. The column focused on the sometimes stormy
relationship between the mayor and the Journal.
   Gissler wrote that Maier's ``combative style, so evident in his
scornful attitude toward the suburbs, has made it hard to build a
metropolitan partnership to address grave challenges such as
economic development and racial segregation.''
   Maier, in the ad, charged that the Journal viewed the
metropolitan area with a suburban orientation.

   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu of
South Africa charged that the United States, Britain and West
Germany support the white-led South African government and its
system of apartheid.
   ``Such big economic and financial interests are involved that
the South African government knows too well that, when compulsory
economic sanctions will be imposed by the United Nations, they will
be automatically vetoed by Washington, London and Bonn,'' the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize winner told a meeting of European
non-governmental organizations working for development.
   ``The South African government can do the worst things, because
it knows that it will be protected,'' the religious leader said on
Monday.
   Tutu called on European countries to suspend landings of South
Arican Airways planes, to limit South Africa's international
communications and to ban South African authorities from financial
markets.

<TEXT>
   Investigators probing an engine fire that caused
a Horizon Air plane to crash here said Monday night the same engine
emitted a strong fuel odor days before the accident.
   The National Transportation Safety Board investigators also said
a 1987 engine fire in a similar plane forced an emergency landing.
   The pilot of the plane that crashed told the investigators that
a different Horizon de Havilland Dash 8 prop plane he was flying
about a week before Friday's crash at Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport lost power briefly in one of its engines, NTSB investigator
Joseph T. Nall said at a news conference.
   Although the engine immediately regained power, pilot Carl
Carlson aborted that flight and landed. He told the NTSB he
understood from other pilots that such a problem ``was not
uncommon, but it was certainly not a regular occurrence,'' Nall
said.
   Nall did not say where that flight originated and landed.
   A June 1987 engine fire aboard a de Havilland Dash 8 involved
fuel spilled into the engine cowling and forced the plane, which
had taken off from Sea-Tac, to make an emergency landing at
Seattle's Boeing Field, Nall said.
   That fire ``involved maintenance-oriented issues relating to the
positioning of (fuel) lines ... that could be crimped upon closing
of various access panels,'' Nall said.
   Horizon Air changed maintenance procedures after that fire, Nall
said, adding ``We don't know at this point if the (June 1987 and
the latest fire) are related.''
   The plane that crashed Friday night, injuring 19 of the 40
people aboard as it smashed into a passenger concourse loading
ramp, was one of 10 Dash 8s in the Horizon fleet.
   Nall said the investigation will try to determine why there was
the fuel on the cowling over the right engine before the crash, and
what caused the fuel to ignite. Nall said the fuel was noticed by
passengers.
   Carlson also told investigators of a maintenance log entry a
week to 10 days before the crash that described a strong fuel odor
coming from the same engine that caught fire, Nall said.
   ``There was some maintenance done and nobody complained of the
smell after (the April 8 report),'' Nall said.
   Horizon Air President John Kelly said earlier Monday that
airline crews checked engines on the company's Dash-8s but found no
problems that would lead to a fire. The checks were not related to
the official investigation into the crash, he added.
   The mangled plane probably will be moved Tuesday to a hangar,
where the right turboprop engine will be removed, said NTSB
spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz. The engine will be sent to the
manufacturer, Pratt & Whitney Canada in Montreal, and taken apart
under NTSB supervision, he said.
   Lopatkiewicz said investigators still did not know why the plane
veered off a runway and headed toward the terminal after it touched
down.
   Carlson and co-pilot Mark Hilstad told NTSB investigators Sunday
in Portland, Ore., that they applied full force to the brakes and
locked the emergency brake, but could not avoid ramming the
passenger ramp. They also said they pushed hard on the right rudder
in an effort to steer the aircraft.
   The pilots' comments during a closed-door meeting were overheard
by reporters outside.
   The pilots said the fire erupted so quickly they had little time
to make an emergency landing. They said they realized they were
going too fast and appeared to be coming down too high to
adequately slow down, but had no choice except to land.
   Three of the injured passengers remained hospitalized Monday,
including Brian Malcolm, 26, of Clarkston, who was in serious but
stable condition.

<TEXT>
   A church court rejected a
vicar's request to remove the pews of his church to make room for
dancing during services.
   John Spokes, chancellor or chief legal officer for the diocese,
ruled on Monday after a three-day hearing that Rev. John Earp could
not make renovations to St. John's church in this town 30 miles
southwest of London.
   Among other changes, Earp had applied to the diocese to replace
pews with chairs facing each other and put an altar on wheels.
   Brian Carlisle, leader of a group opposing the changes,
testified at the hearing that the alterations would ruin the
``dignity and majesty'' of the Victorian church's interior and make
it look like a ``social club.''
   The Bishop of Winchester, the Right Rev. Colin James, said in a
statement that he and his senior staff would do ``everything
possible to work for reconciliation, mutual understanding and above
all healing in the parish.'' James is bishop of the region that
includes Earp's church.

   A man was sentenced to 30 days in jail for
killing his wife's kitten by cooking it in a microwave oven.
   George Jimenez, 26, of suburban Atwater, pleaded no contest to
one count of cruelty to animals in the Sept. 16 death of the cat.
   He was in a drunken rage when he killed the animal because his
wife went to a movie with a female friend, authorities said.
   In addition to the jail term, Jimenez was ordered Monday to
either pay a $150 fine or spend another five additional days in
jail and was placed on two years' probation.
   During the probation, Jimenez must undergo counseling and is
forbidden to harass his wife, said Deputy City Attorney Katherine
MacKenzie.

   The Philippine air force said one of
its F-5 jet planes accidentally dropped a practice bomb on a sugar
plantation owned by President Corazon Aquino's family.
   Initial reports blamed the U.S. Air Force for the incident on
Thursday, in which there were no casualties or damage. But a
Philippine air force statement issued late Monday said a Filipino
plane was responsible.
   Such bombs contain small amounts of explosives and spew out
smoke so pilots can determine how close the bombs come to targets
during practice runs.
   The statement said the bomb fell from one of three planes which
flew low over the Hacienda Luisita plantation during a training
exercise. The Philippine air force operates a bombing range near
the plantation north of Manila.
   The plantation is near the U.S.-run Clark Air Base.

there,'' Kirkpatrick said at a news conference Monday before
addressing members of the Central Bancorporation Inc.
   ``Obviously, we don't want the (Persian) Gulf to be mined ...
(but) I think the confrontation is dangerous ... and it's not in
the interest of anybody,'' she said.
   U.S. forces on Monday destroyed two of Iran's Persian Gulf oil
platforms, sank or damaged four attack boats and disabled two
frigates.
   The attack was in retaliation for an incident last week in which
a U.S. ship was damaged by a mine, injuring 10 crewmembers.
   Kirkpatrick, who said she was ``a little disturbed by current
events,'' did say the U.S. should maintain a presence in the area.
   ``Obviously, the United States has a role, an interest in the
Persian Gulf,'' she said. But ``I personally think we should have
kept a lower profile _ to send not 17 (ships) but three. It's very
important to have a U.S. presence ... in the Gulf.''
   Kirkpatrick said she did not think the United States would go to
war with Iran ``because of the implications of a declared war ...
and because so many of our good friends sell arms to Iran.''
   She also said the United States would not declare war on Iran
``so we can back off'' and pull out later.
   Kirkpatrick also downplayed speculation that she may be
considered as a vice-presidential candidate on the Republican
ticket.
   ``I think that it's a very bad job,'' she said of the vice
presidency. ``No serious person would really want it.''

<HEAD>Jackson Fails to Woo Jews, Says Outspoken Civil Rights Commission
Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission says Jesse Jackson ought to go to Israel to prove he
isn't anti-Jewish and to repair the damage wrought by his overtures
to PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
   Clarence Pendleton Jr. told the Heritage chain of Jewish weekly
newspapers in Southern California such a move would make ``real
overtures to the Jewish community like there was to Arafat, like
there was to Castro.''
   Pendleton, a conservative Republican who has been commission
chairman for six years, made the remarks in an interview at his San
Diego office on April 6 that was published last Friday.
   Pendleton wondered: ``Why doesn't he (Jackson) go now to Israel
and say, `I'm sorry for what happens to you, let's see if we can
get this thing straightened out.'''
   Jackson was campaigning in New York on Monday, the eve of the
presidential primary in that state, which has a significant Jewish
vote. There are 255 delegates at stake and polls have shown
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis leading with Jackson in second.

   Republican Party chairmen from 18 Western
states are urging Vice President George Bush to select a Westerner
as his running mate and one of those being mentioned as a
possibility is Interior Secretary Donald Hodel, a native of Oregon.
   The chairmen met with Bush, the apparent Republican nominee for
president, over breakfast and with President Reagan over lunch on
Monday to discuss GOP politics in the West and the need for the
party to run a strong presidential campaign in the region.
   ``Washington, Oregon and California can't be considered
absolutely in the Republican column,'' said Jennifer Dunn,
Washington state Republican chairman.
   Ms. Dunn said Hodel, a former administrator of the Bonneville
Power Administration and secretary of energy, and California Gov.
George Deukmejian were mentioned as possibilities.
   However, ``Bush said he did not have a short list or a long list
of possible running mates,'' said the Oregon GOP chairman, T.J.

<HEAD>Only One Ohio Debate Seen; May Exclude Dukakis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ohio's public radio and television
stations will sponsor the only televised debate between Democratic
presidential candidates scheduled in Ohio before the state's May 3
primary.
   George Zimmermann, spokesman for the network and executive
producer for the debate, said Monday it will be held in Columbus on
April 27, from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m., and will be carried live from
Columbus.
   Since the Republican nomination is virtually assured for Vice
President George Bush, the debate, moderated by Robert Seigel, host
of National Public Radio's ``All Things Considered,'' will only
involve Democrats.
   Zimmermann said the campaigns of Jesse Jackson and Sen. Al Gore
Jr. of Tennessee have tentatively confirmed the date, but
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis has a previous commitment in New
Jersey which has its primary June 7.
   Zimmermann said he is hopeful that Dukakis can re-arrange his
schedule so that he can appear with the others on the Ohio program.
``We believe it's important that Ohio voters be given a chance to
see and hear the three Democratic candidates for president on the
issues, side by side,'' Zimmermann said.

<HEAD>Officials Certify McCrery vs. Campbell Votes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials open the voting machines today
and certify results from a special weekend election in which
Republican Jim McCrery apparently defeated Democrat Foster Campbell
for the congressional seat vacated by Gov. Buddy Roemer.
   Unofficial returns gave McCrery only a 1,300-vote lead and, if
the victory holds up, the former Roemer aide would become the first
Republican since Reconstruction to represent northwest Louisiana's
4th District in the House of Representatives.
   Campbell, a Democratic state senator, and other party officials
refused to concede.
   ``We're not going to really say anything until we take a look at
what the official count is,' State Democratic Party Chairman Jim
Brady. ``I'm not saying it's decided at all. We're going to wait
until Tuesday and see what develops.''
   The voting machines from the nine-parish district were back in
the warehouse, where they have been locked since Saturday when
Roemer called for private guards to augment state police to keep an
eye on the machines until the official canvass of the votes.
   Unofficial returns compiled by the secretary of state after
Saturday's voting showed McCrery with 63,488 or 50.5 percent, to
62,139 for Campbell.

<HEAD>City To Celebrate 350th With An Eye Toward Solving Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This city on the upswing is using its
350th birthday to celebrate its successes and find new ways to deal
with the urban ills that provide a constant reminder of its
failings.
   But not everyone believes there is reason to celebrate.
   Critics point to the grim statistics that often dominate
descriptions of New Haven: a high poverty rate that makes it one of
the nation's poorest cities; blighted neighborhoods; the large
number of drug-related AIDS cases.
   But the organizers of ``New Haven 350'' say that despite the
problems, a celebration is in order for this self-proclaimed
cultural capital of Connecticut, which has enjoyed a
multimillion-dollar revitalization in recent years and is home to
Yale University.
   ``We feel the city has turned the corner and is moving in a very
positive direction,'' said Rob Schwartz, a Yale-New Haven Hospital
official who is one of the co-chairmen of the birthday celebration.
   The people of New Haven ``have reason to be proud of what we
have achieved to date,'' said Schwartz.
   Three major events are scheduled to celebrate the birthday: a
city fair June 4 and 5, a giant fireworks show July 4, and series
of town meetings sometime this fall.
   While the first two events are intended to showcase the city's
achievements and demonstrate its worthiness as a tourist
attraction, the town meetings will be used to mobilize the entire
community for problem-solving.
   Yale and other major institutions and businesses are helping to
fund the events. This Sunday, Mayor Biagio DiLieto and the dean of
Yale's drama school will narrate a history of the city during a
concert that also will mark the first public performance of a score
composed in honor of New Haven's birthday by a Yale professor.
   ``I recognize, of course, some people might question the need
for a celebration given the many serious human and social problems
we have,'' DiLieto said in a recent interview. ``But I believe a
birthday celebration is uplifting to the spirt of the people.''
   Only those who have witnessed the changes over the last decade
in this city of 126,000 people can appreciate the amount of
progress that has been made, said DiLieto.
   The downtown has undergone a transformation that amounts to
nothing less than a renaissance, according to the mayor.
   And the work continues.
   In addition to new shops, officials say more than 1 million
square feet of office space is under construction or proposed for
the next five years as developers gamble the resurgence will
continue and new companies will be lured to the Long Island Sound
port founded by the Puritans in 1638.
   But critics say much of what the city has done is merely
cosmetic, and that the main beneficiaries of the downtown
redevelopment have been developers, not the people who make New
Haven, according to the 1980 census, the seventh poorest city in
the nation.
   ``They are fixing up the downtown but they are doing nothing in
the black community,'' said Haywood Hooks Jr., a research chemist
who is president of the Greater New Haven chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   ``Unfortunately, I don't think it is time for blacks to
celebrate,'' he said. Blacks comprise more than 30 percent of the
population.
   DiLieto, who has been in office since 1980, said his
administration has demonstrated a commitment to the neighborhoods
as well as the downtown. The city has created more than 3,000
housing units for mostly low- and middle-income people and has
provided loans and grants, as well as accompanying public
improvements, for property owners who wish to make their own
improvements, he said.
   Karl Hilgert, executive director of Christian Community Action,
a provider of emergency services and advocate for the poor and
homeless, said the administration ``clearly has made efforts'' to
help the disadvantaged but that ``the concern for economic
development needs to be geared more to jobs that get people above
the poverty level.''

   NASA plans this summer to take the first step

lift space shuttles into orbit well into the next century.
   Contractors will be asked to submit proposals for a $1.2 billion

rocket in a government-owned plant.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration now gets its
shuttle rockets from a single source, Morton Thiokol, Inc., which
owns its manufacturing facilities in Utah. A government-owned plant
will enable NASA to change contractors if it becomes dissatisfied.
   The request for proposals will be issued in June or July, NASA
said, in order to have the Advanced Solid Rocket Motor available

   NASA officials have testified to Congress that the prime
candidates for the site are on government-owned land in Bay St.
Louis and Yellow Creek in Mississippi and one near Cape Canaveral

<HEAD>Pierce Says HUD Serves More With Less Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. says
his agency is ``taking care of more people by far, with much less
money'' than when he took office in 1981.
   Pierce on Monday defended the administration's $19 billion
spending request for the Department of Housing and Urban
Development for fiscal 1989 ore a Senate Appropriations
subcommittee. The request is up slightly from current outlays of
$18.6 billion.
   The only member of Reagan's original Cabinet who remains in
office, Pierce has presided over a dramatic decline in HUD's
spending authority _ the ceiling for separately approved
appropriations _ from $33.4 billion in 1981 to a proposed $13.6
billion next year.
   The secretary said he did ``more with less'' by getting rid of
big, costly HUD programs of questionable effectiveness and
streamlining others inherited from previous Democratic
administrations.
   He said HUD is assisting 4.3 million needy families this year,
compared with 3.3 million in 1981. Actual outlays over the same
period have slowly increased, from $14 billion to a projected $18.6
billion this year.

<HEAD>Conviction Strains Relationship Of Ukrainian And Jewish Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOROTHY GAST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of retired autoworker John Demjanjuk
were outraged that Israeli judges convicted him as the Nazi death
camp guard ``Ivan the Terrible,'' and said the decision will rouse
anti-Semitism in America.
   Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian immigrant to the Cleveland suburb of
Seven Hills, was convicted Monday in Israel of war crimes in
connection with the deaths of 850,000 Jews at the Treblinka death
camp in Nazi-occupied Poland in 1942 and 1943.
   Peter Jacyk, a Toronto resident of Ukrainian descent who helped
raise money for Demjanjuk, said Monday the effect the verdict has
on the world view of the Jewish community will be similar to the
``crucifixion of Jesus Christ.
   ``I think people will be outraged because they know Demjanjuk is
innocent,'' Jacyk said. ``In the long run, it will have a very
negative effect on Israel and Jews. It will definitely be
long-remembered.''
   Demjanjuk, who could be sentenced to death or life imprisonment
when the court reconvenes April 25, has gotten some of his
strongest backing from Cleveland area residents of Ukrainian
descent. More than 200 people gathered Sunday at St. Vladimir's
Cathedral in Parma, a Ukrainian Orthodox church, to pray for
Demjanjuk, 68, and his family.
   ``It (the conviction) is bound to have a negative effect on the
American population's view of Israel,'' said Bill Liscynesky of
Parma, who heads the Cleveland-area United Ukrainian Organizations.
``The majority of Americans feel that Demjanjuk is innocent.''
   Liscynesky said ``telephones are probably very hot'' spreading
the word among local Ukrainians about Demjanjuk's conviction. He
said his coalition has about 20,000 active members. There are an
estimated 2 million people of Ukrainian descent in the United
States.
   ``I understand very well why they (Ukrainians) are hurting very
badly,'' said Martin J. Plax, Cleveland director of the American
Jewish Committee. ``It's like when someone gets cut and you yell
`ouch' and you start cursing. That's what they're doing right now.
In time I suspect the dust will settle and we'll get back to doing
things to bring the two communities together.''
   Plax said he was ``profoundly shocked by the sternness of the
judges' verdict.'' But a former Cleveland lawyer who helped win
Demjanjuk's extradition to Israel in 1986 said the conviction
didn't surrprise him.
   ``I think there was no doubt that he was given a fair trial,
that every possible defense was raised and thoroughly defended,''
said Alvin Lodish, a former Justice Department lawyer who practices
in Miami. ``There can be no doubt who John Demjanjuk really is.''
   Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith, hailed the conviction of Demjanjuk as
``gratifying evidence that even 40 years after the Holocaust,
justice can prevail over evil.''
   Foxman said the year-long trial ``reflected Israel's commitment
to the democratic rule of law.''
   In Albany, N.Y., Deborah Rausch, who attended the trial, said on
behalf of her local chapter of Holocaust Survivors and Friends in
Pursuit of Justice, ``We commend the state of Israel for accepting
this reponsibility and we hope they will continue to prosecute Nazi
war criminals who have found haven throughout the world.''
   Elizabeth Holtzman, a New York City prosecutor who formerly
sponsored legislation in Congress to allow for deportation of Nazi
war criminals, said the conviction ``sends the world a signal that
Nazi war criminals cannot escape.''

   A man was sentenced to 30 days in jail for

   He was in a drunken rage when he killed the animal because his
wife went to a movie with a female friend, authorities said.
   In addition to the jail term, Jimenez was ordered Monday to
either pay a $150 fine or spend another five additional days in
jail and was placed on two years' probation.
   During the probation, Jimenez must undergo counseling and is
forbidden to harass his wife, said Deputy City Attorney Katherine

   Mark O'Connor defended John Demjanjuk
because he was convinced the retired autoworker couldn't be the
Nazi death camp guard who savagely beat Jews on the way to the gas
chamber.
   Demjanjuk was a gentle old man who'd bounce O'Connor's
3-year-old daughter on his knee, smiling and talking nonsense.
   O'Connor, a Buffalo lawyer who specialized in immigration law,
moved to Jerusalem to defend the 68-year-old Ukrainian who lived in
a Cleveland suburb. O'Connor had insisted it was a case of mistaken
identity and warned that an innocent man should not be punished
because of a desire for revenge.
   That was five years ago. Today, O'Connor is pondering the man he
thought he knew, the man who was convicted Monday in Israel of
being the sadistic guard known as ``Ivan the Terrible.''
   ``Toward the end, I looked at how calmly and cooly he removed me
from this case after I fought for him for so many years believing
in him, believing in his credibility,'' O'Connor said. ``I began to
wonder whether I'd made a mistake.''
   O'Connor, who was the chief defense attorney until last year
when he was removed by the Israeli court at Demjanjuk's request,
said the case against his former client was extensive.
   The defense depended on creating a reasonable doubt about
whether Demjanjuk was ``Ivan.''
   O'Connor tried to show that documents supplied by the Soviet
Union linking Demjanjuk to the Nazis were forged. He also he tried
to cast doubt on the testimony of witnesses, many of whom were old
and in frail health.
   The court, however, rejected the arguments.
   ``We determine decisively and without hesitation or doubt that
the accused John Demjanjuk who is on trial before us, is Ivan,
known as Ivan the Terrible, the operator of the gas chambers,''
said presiding Judge Dov Levine.
   Levine's summation indicated that the judges gave great weight
to the testimony of five survivors who identified Demjanjuk as the
Ukrainian guard at the Treblinka death camp in Poland.
   The court also noted that Demjanjuk's testimony was ``filled
with inconsistent versions.''
   O'Connor acknowledged that Demjanjuk's testimony was ``spotty,''
and said he understood how the judges could have conceived of
Demjanjuk's memory lapses as incriminating.
   He said Demjanjuk chose not to prepare for cross-examination.
   ``It was one of the exceptions he took with the court and
ultimately with his defense,'' O'Connor said.
   O'Connor, who was asked to take the case by Demjanjuk's
daughter, was dismissed because of a dispute with Demjanjuk's
family and the Ukrainian community that supported him over the
direction of the case.
   ``They (the family) didn't understand the culture or country the
way I did,'' he said of Israel. ``To explain why I was using a
Talmudic argument to a religious judge sitting on the bench was
something that became more and more difficult. ...
   ``They thought I was pro-Jewish,'' he said.
   O'Connor said he thought it was irrational to attack the
Holocaust survivors who are considered a national resource.
   The attorney that replaced O'Connor as chief defender, Yoram
Sheftel, changed the tone of the defense, trying to discredit the
prosecution's witnesses.
   The tactic may have damaged the defense because it alienated
public opinion, O'Connor said.
   ``The whole country was affixed to the trial and there was a
sense that the judges knew they were deciding for the people,'' he
said.
   Showing respect and deference was the only way to keep people
from viewing Demjanjuk as a ``symbol of past wrongs,'' he said.
   Despite the emotionally charged atmosphere, O'Connor thinks
Demjanjuk got a fair trial.
   ``It can't be said that he (Demjanjuk) didn't have every
opportunity to present evidence,'' he said. ``He couldn't have got
a fairer trial.''
   Under Israeli law, Demjanjuk's case will automatically be
appealed and will probably be reviewed by the nation's Supreme
Court.
   O'Connor said the court would give the case an extensive review
and offer Demjanjuk another chance to cast doubt on whether he is
``Ivan the Terrible.''

<HEAD>Iran Fired Silkworm Missiles At U.S. Ships</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran fired land-based Silkworm missiles
at U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf during a battle in which
American forces destroyed two Iranian oil platforms and sank or
damaged six Iranian vessels.
   The three-ship convoy led by the USS Jack Williams took evasive
action and fired chaff into the air, which confused the Silkworms'
radar guidance system and caused the five missiles to miss the
convoy in the southern gulf.
   The missile attack on Monday represented the first reported
firing of the Silkworm batteries along Iran's coast at ships in the
southern gulf or the Strait of Hormuz, the waterway's narrow
entrance.
   The attack was witnessed by Associated Press correspondent
Richard Pyle who was aboard the Williams with a Pentagon news media
pool. Besides the frigate Williams, the convoy included two
destroyers, the Strauss and the O'Brien.
   Iranian forces on Monday also raided Arab oil facilities;
American, British and Cypriot merchant vessels; and a press
helicopter. U.S. forces sank or damaged four Iranian attack boats
and disabled two Iranian frigates.
   Monday's fighting between the United States and Iran began when
the U.S. Navy attacked two Iranian oil platforms as a ``measured
response'' to the explosion of a mine, allegedly planted by Iran,
that blew a hole in the American USS Samuel B. Roberts last
Thursday and wounded 10 sailors.
   The fighting that followed was the most intense since President
Reagan ordered last summer that Navy forces be strengthened in the
gulf, where Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.
   No American casualties were reported in Monday's fighting.
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said in Washington the Navy was
searching for a Cobra attack helicopter with two crewmen that had
not returned to a cruiser.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Britain and Cyprus, said several people were killed or injured in
the attack on the two oil platforms but gave no further details.
   In a separate dispatch, the news agency also said on Monday
night that Iranian warships ``in a heroic clash with the aggressor
American helicopters in the Persian Gulf shot down one of them
Monday afternoon.''
   Two groups of U.S. Navy warships struck the Iranian oil
platforms Sassan and Sirri-D, 100 miles apart in the southern gulf,
on Monday morning. Crews on the platforms were given advance
warning to evacuate the platforms, which have been used as bases
for speedboat attacks on neutral shipping.
   One platform was destroyed by naval gunfire and the other by
explosives placed on it, according to statements in Washington.
   The Iranian news agency said U.S. warships attacked the Sassan
platform first, then hit the Nasr platform off nearby Sirri Island.
   Iranian gunboats then went on a rampage in the southern gulf.
   Carlucci said a Navy helicopter was fired upon during the raid
on the platforms but not hit. Iranians shot at a press helicopter
carrying an NBC-TV crew and Associated Press photographer Norbert
Schiller, but missed.
   Schiller said the ``Iranians fired at least half a dozen
.50-caliber rounds and small-arms fire'' at the helicopter.
   He said part of Sirri-D collapsed and the platform still was
burning before sundown. Sassan was badly damaged ``but the main
structure was still standing and the fire was put out by five
Iranian tugboats, which also fired at our helicopter,'' Schiller
said.
   Two Iranian warplanes tried to harass a U.S. warship but the
ship fired missiles and the aircraft fled, shipping sources in
Dubai reported.
   They said an Iranian patrol boat fired at the U.S. cruiser
Wainwright, one of the ships attacking Sassan and Sirri-D, but did
not hit it. The frigate Simpson returned fire and sank the Iranian
boat, the sources added.
   In late afternoon, the 310-foot Iranian frigate Sahand
confronted three U.S. warships in the Strait of Hormuz. Ignoring
repeated warnings, the Sahand fired at three A-6 Intruder aircraft
near the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise.
   The USS Strauss hit the Sahand with a Harpoon missile that left
the Iranian ship ablaze, according to Pentagon reports.
   Pentagon officials said the Iranian frigate Sabalan fired on an
A-6 and the plane attacked, hitting the ship with a laser-guided
bomb.
   Iranian warships also attacked oil facilities at the Mubarak oil
field off the emirate of Sharjah in the southern gulf, targeting
the Scanbay drilling rig, the 112,744-ton British tanker York
Marine and a storage facility, shipping executives reported.
   They said the York Marine was set afire and its crew abandoned
ship, and the Scanbay reported attacks by four gunboats.
   Iranian gunboats fired at but missed the American tugboat Willi
Tide, operated by Tidewater Inc. of New Orleans. Warplanes they
could not identify flew low over the attacking Iranians, forcing
them to flee, the executives said. They said the Iranians also
attacked the Cypriot freighter Monium Pride in the Hormuz, off the
United Arab Emirates, setting it afire.

   The U.S. dollar climbed against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo Tuesday, while stock prices declined slightly following the
news of fighting in the Persian Gulf and the overnight setback on
Wall Street.
   The dollar finished the day at 124.37, up 0.59 yen from its
close of 123.78 yen Monday. It had opened the day at 124.30 yen and
fluctuated between 124.25 yen and 124.53 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
a sharp 222.12-point loser Monday, shed a modest 14.45 points, or
0.05 percent, closing the day at 26,657.00.
   U.S. forces destroyed two Iranian oil platforms in the gulf on
Monday in retaliation for an Iranian mine attack that damaged a
U.S. frigate on patrol in international waters last week.
   ``Participants sidestepped the market following the Middle
Eastern turmoil and the overnight setback on Wall Street,'' said
Taketomi Kikuchi of Sanyo Securities.
   A wait-and-see attitude also has prevailed since the Nikkei
index surged to a record high of 27,111.35 points last Thursday,
surpassing the 27,000-point level for the first time before falling
back, Kikuchi said.
   ``The dollar was being purchased in morning trading following
renewed tension in the Persian Gulf,'' said an exchange dealer at a
major commercial bank in Tokyo.

   Four siblings brutally stabbed to
death in their home were buried side-by-side as family members
called for a reform of a judicial system they partly blamed for the
deaths.
   More than 1,000 mourners filed past the caskets of Jennifer
Mann, 19; Shannon Mann, 17; Martha Mann, 15; and Ernest Mann, 11
before their burial Monday.
   The four were killed early Friday when an assailant broke into
their mobile home and attacked them with steak knives, some of
which broke in their bodies because of the strength of the blows,
authorities have said.
   The parents, Ernest and Rebecca Mann, who are separated and were
not home at the time of the attack, had to be supported physically
by relatives as they walked to the burial site.
   Shannon Mann's 20-year-old former boyfriend, Leo Narvaiz Jr.,
who was arrested shortly after the attack, remained in jail today
under $4.05 million bond on four capital murder charges and a
charge of criminal mischief.
   Grady Mann Jr., an uncle of the victims, told reporters before
the memorial service that the judicial system was flawed because
police did not arrest Narvaiz quickly enough in connection with an
earlier threat against the children and their friends.
   ``Although Ernest and Rebecca Mann and their four children
believed enough in the system to allow the police department and
the district attorney's office to protect them from threat and
harm, the one fact remains, what should have happened did not,''
Grady Mann said.
   ``It is our hope this tragedy might serve as a catalyst for all
of us nationally to personally protest the system that has
evolved,'' he said. ``The system protects and shelters the rights
of the few and in so doing neglects the needs of the many. The time
for change is now, lest another family need go through the agony
and torture of loss, whether one or many.''
   Narvaiz was accused of threatening Shannon Mann's current
boyfriend, Ricky Moore, 24, and of damaging Moore's pickup truck
during a fight on March 28.
   Moore had filed a complaint against Narvaiz and Jennifer and
Shannon Moore had given police statements about the incident.
Authorities said they were looking for Narvaiz before the attack
occurred.
   The friends and family members who attended the memorial service
walked past four identical closed caskets, marked with the victims'
pictures and surrounded by hundreds of roses and pink and blue
carnations.
   The Rev. Daniel M. Hubbell told mourners he had talked with the
children's mother and, ``She wanted more than anything else for the
young people that are here to understand the hurt and the pain so
that you, too, may be prepared for it one day. ... This proves to
us today that we live in a sinful and murderous world.''

<HEAD>Abortion Rights Advocates Sue To Block Parental Consent Provision</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of new abortion restrictions sued
in state and federal courts to head off provisions of a
Pennsylvania law before it takes effect next week.
   ``The goal is to block the implementation of the nation's most
restrictive abortion control law,'' Barry Steinhardt, executive
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania,
said of the lawsuit filed Monday.
   ``This law seeks to make an abortion as difficult to obtain as
possible, physically, financially and emotionally,'' said Susan
Cary Nicholas, a lawyer for the Philadelphia-based Women's Law
Project.
   Gov. Robert P. Casey is confident the law, which he signed March
25, will stand up in court, said his press secretary, Robert
Grotevant.
   ``We drafted it with the constitution in mind,'' said Francis
Viglietta, a spokesman for the anti-abortion Pennsylvania Catholic
Conference. ``It will pass the constitutional muster.''
   The law is scheduled to take effect Sunday, but Steinhardt said
lawyers would press this week for court injunctions to prevent that.
   ``We have a number of reasons for believing that this law will
not go into effect as scheduled,'' said Steffan Presser, the state
ACLU legal director.
   The suit filed in U.S. District Court challenges the law's
requirement that minors obtain parental or judicial consent before
abortions. The restrictions violate rights of privacy, due process
and freedom of association guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and
other federal laws, the suit says.
   It also challenges reporting requirements that would force
clinics and doctors that provide abortions to supply information to
the state. Those provisions could open clinics, doctors and women
seeking abortions to harassment and potentional violence from
anti-abortion activists, Ms. Nicholas said.
   A companion suit filed in Commonwealth Court is aimed at a
provision that would require indigent rape and incest victims to
report the crimes to law-enforcement agencies before they could
receive Medicaid funding for an abortion.
   The suit was filed on behalf of an unidentified Medicaid
recipient who has twice been the victim of rape and was mistreated
by police when she reported the crime, the suit says.
   Additional plaintiffs include Women Organized Against Rape, the
Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center and the counseling organization,
Choice.
   Mary Beliveau, legislative coordinator for the Pennsylvania
Pro-Life Federation, said the lawsuit seeks to ``allow the abortion
industry to keep parents in the dark'' about the health of their
children.
   ``It is inconceivable that pro-abortion groups would challenge
legislation that provides parents with the right to supervise the
health care of their minor children,'' she added.
   In 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down key provisions of a
1982 law. Those provisions required doctors to make a record that
could be made public of every abortion they performed; required
doctors to inform women seeking abortions about potential risks and
available benefits for prenatal care and childbirth; and required
the presence of two doctors for abortions performed in the third
trimester.
   In December, Casey, a Democrat, vetoed an abortion control bill
that would have required notification of sexual partners or
parental notification in the case of a minor.

<TEXT>
   Contra leaders, treated to a heroes' return by
dozens of Nicaraguan exiles here, expressed satisfaction with the
progress made during peace talks in Managua even though no
agreement was reached.
   ``We were able to come out of the four days and still keep
negotiating,'' said Adolfo Calero, one of four Nicaraguan
Resistance directors who arrived at Miami International Airport
late Monday.
   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed
rebels are scheduled to meet again in the capital of their country
at the end of the month.
   The peace talks that were adjourned Monday marked the first time
in the 6{-year-old war that the Sandinistas have agreed to
negotiate with their foes in Managua.
   ``Things are better than they were,'' Calero said after the
singing and cheering died down at the airport.
   ``Our major accomplishment has been to sit with the Sandinistas
face to face,'' said director Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, adding that
the climate of the talks was ``sincere.''
   ``In my opinion, the Sandinistas behaved responsibly,'' Chamorro
said.
   But he also said his expectations going into the talks were not
high, and he emphasized that the government needed to institute
democratic changes.
   Negotiations have been deadlocked over the so-called
``democratization'' issue.
   The Sandinistas have insisted the rebels sign a permanent truce
immediately. They say Contra delegates would then be allowed to
take part in a ``national reconciliation dialogue'' with leaders of
the country's 14 legally recognized political parties.
   Contra leaders are demanding that the Sandinistas first carry
out democratic reforms, or at least pledge to do so.
   The Contras and the Sandinistas last month signed a peace
agreement that provided for a temporary cease-fire while they
negotiated a permanent truce. The 60-day cease-fire went into
effect April 1.
   In Managua on Monday, the Contra leaders visited Roman Catholic
officials and editors at La Prensa, the only opposition newspaper
and whose publisher is Chamorro's mother, Violeta.
   His father, also named Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, was slain Jan.
10, 1978, in a killing widely blamed on the right-wing government
in power at the time. The slaying helped unleash the revolt that
toppled President Anastasio Somoza and swept the Sandinistas into
power in July 1979.
   Also returning here were Alfredo Cesar and Azucena Ferrey,
directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance, an umbrella rebel
organization based in Miami.

   John Reardon, a baritone who regularly
appeared as the opera maker ``Reardon'' in the children's public
television program ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,'' has died of
pneumonia. He was 58.
   Reardon died Saturday at his Santa Fe home, officials of the
Pittsburgh-based program said Monday.
   Reardon's career spanned 30 years of opera and musical theater,
beginning with his Broadway appearance in ``Do Re Mi.''
   At the Metropolitan Opera in New York, he starred in many new
productions, including ``Carmen.'' His long association with
composer-conductor Leonard Bernstein included recordings of
Bernstein's ``On the Town'' and Haydn's ``Creation.''
   His last public performance was March 11 with the Buffalo (N.Y.)
Philharmonic Orchestra.
   His manager, Ethel Siegel of Washington, D.C., said there was no
funeral. She said a memorial scholarship will be established in his
name.

   The University of Oregon is considering
banning beer parties at fraternities and sororities.
   The so-called ``keggers'' also would be banned from
university-affiliated housing.
   ``What we're saying is, `No kegs,' whether they're legally able
to drink or not,'' Gerard Moseley, vice president for student
affairs at the 17,500-student school, said Monday.
   Each housing group also would be required to sponsor alcohol and
drug education programs at least twice each academic year.
   While the housing groups include some students older than age
21, the majority of their residents have not reached legal drinking
age, Moseley said.
   Fraternity and sorority members at least 21 would be allowed to
``possess and use alcoholic beverages in personal use amounts,''
the proposal said.
   Complaints of underage people drinking prompted the proposal,
Moseley said.
   Students will be asked for comments about the proposal during
the next few weeks.

<HEAD>Award Postponed Amid Charges of Winner Fostering Anti-Semitism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presentation of the $369,000 Templeton Prize for
Progress in Religion has been postponed because of an investigation
of charges that this year's winner helped spread anti-Semitism, a
newspaper reported today.
   Inamullah Khan of Pakistan, secretary-general of the World
Moslem Congress, was to have received the award May 10, according
to an announcement last month by the sponsors of the annual prize.
He was the first Moslem to win the award, which has been presented
15 times.
   The New York Times reported that prize officers have delayed the
presentation pending an investigation that centers on complaints by
the American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith that Khan and his organization have fostered
anti-Semitism for years.
   Khan says he has difference with Zionists ``because the U.N.
General Assembly has declared Zionism a racist creed.'' But he
said, ``I can never support anti-Semitic feelings because I am
myself a descendant of Semitic ancestors from the Middle East.''
   The Templeton officers praised Khan last month for promoting
interreligious cooperation, and his supporters say he and his
organization have been more willing than other Islamic groups to
maintain contacts with Jews.
   But the Times reported that the newsletter of the World Moslem
Congress, while under Khan's direction, published praise of
anti-Semitic tracts and accused Jews and Zionists of controlling
U.S. politics and media.
   The newsletter, The Moslem World, advertised and endorsed ``The
Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' and Henry Ford's ``The
International Jew,'' two notoriously anti-Semitic tracts, in the
mid-1970s.
   Past recipients of the Templeton Prize include Mother Teresa,
the Rev. Billy Graham and Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn.
   Sir John Templeton, an American-born financier living in the
Bahamas, established the prize in 1972 as a religious counterpart
to the Nobel Prizes for peace, science and literature.

   The dollar closed higher today against the Japanese
yen in Tokyo, while stock prices declined modestly following the
news of increased fighting in the Persian Gulf and the overnight
easing on Wall Street.
   The dollar closed at 124.37 yen, up 0.59 yen from its close of
123.78 yen Monday. It had opened the day at 124.40 yen and
fluctuated between 124.25 yen and 124.53 yen.
   ``The dollar started the day substantially higher, boosted by
the overnight advance in New York, but it moved in a narrow range
throughout the day,'' said Michiko Kawai of the Bank of Tokyo.
   Trading was relatively calm as participants sidestepped the
market, watching the development of the Middle Eastern turmoil, she
said.
   U.S. forces destroyed two Iranian platforms in the gulf on
Monday in retaliation for an Iranian mine attack that damaged a
U.S. frigate on patrol in international waters.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
a 222.12- point loser Monday, shed a modest 14.45 points, or 0.05
percent, to end the day's trading at 26,657.
   Share prices rallied during the afternoon session to erase most
of their losses and ended little changed. The Nikkei index was down
226.64 points at the end of the morning session as participants,
nervous about the gulf fighting, sidestepped the market, traders
said.
   The release of a number of U.S. and Japanese economic indicators
later this week and the approach of the holiday-studded ``Golden
Week'' have also kept some investors on the sidelines, they said.
The week begins Friday, April 29, which is Emperor Hirohito's
birthday, which is a holiday. It includes other non-trading days on
Sunday, May 1, and three other national holidays May 3-5.
   Volume on the first-section trade was estimated at a thin 600
million shares, up slightly from 550 million shares Monday.
Declining issues outpaced advancers 509 to 375, while 174 issues
were unchanged.
   Losers include steels and chemicals. Textiles, papers and drugs
also lost ground. Electricals and oils were firm.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer persuaded Liberace to sign a
will he didn't want shortly before his death, then ``began robbing
Liberace's grave'' by mismanaging hundreds of thousands of dollars
from the estate, an attorney says.
   Los Angeles lawyer Joel Strote, executor of the estate, wanted
Liberace's money and even went to the entertainer's Palm Springs,
Calif., home after his death and declared, ``I am Liberace,''
attorney Harold Gewerter charged during opening arguments in a
civil suit.
   But Strote testified Monday in state district court that
Liberace called him three weeks before his death and asked that the
will be updated and that longtime manager Seymour Heller be
replaced as executor by Strote.
   ``He said he did not want to use Seymour anymore and asked me if
I could do it,'' said Strote.
   Strote said the flamboyant entertainer wanted to make sure that
most of the estate went to a trust to fund the Liberace Foundation
for the Performing Arts, which provides scholarships at 22
colleges. The will named Strote trustee of the foundation.
   Outside court, Heller, who is one of the five plaintiffs,
estimated Liberace's estate at $20 million. About $2 million was
raised last week in a Los Angeles auction of Liberace's belongings.
   Gewerter charged Monday that Strote executed Liberace's will 13
days before the multi-millionaire's death and the performer had no
idea what he was signing.
   ``Liberace was in such a mental state on (Jan.) 22nd that he
couldn't understand or read independently,'' Gewerter said. ``If
(comedian) Pee Wee Herman had walked into his room and said he
wanted to be executor, he (Liberace) would have said `yes.' He
(Strote) goes into that room owning nothing and comes out with a
bag of goodies.''
   Gewerter said Strote has mismanaged hundreds of thousands of
dollars from the estate, and that Strote is spending the estate's
money on personal possessions.
   ``The fraud of Mr. Strote doesn't stop with the will,'' Gewerter
said. ``He believed he was the embodiment of Liberace. He wanted to
be Liberace. More important _ he wanted Liberace's money. Once he
became trustee he began robbing Liberace's grave.''
   The suit seeks to replace Strote as trustee with Heller,
Liberace's close friend and manager for 36 years, and Frank
DiBella, the late performer's accountant. It also seeks to remove
Strote as executor of the will.
   In his opening remarks, Strote's attorney, John O'Reilly, said
the plaintiffs were only angry that they did not get more money out
of the estate and that Strote had served well as executor.
   Strote said Liberace's doctor declared him physically and
mentally fit just before they met to sign the will at the
entertainer's Palm Springs home Jan. 22, 1987.
   ``He read what I highlighted but I don't think he read every
word,'' Strote said. ``He asked me generally what was the
importance of each paper.''
   Liberace died Feb. 5, 1987, of complications stemming from AIDS.
He was 67.
   Gewerter said Liberace had vowed three months earlier to fire
Strote, who had served as Liberace's attorney on various occasions.
   The other plaintiffs are Dorothy McMahon, Liberace's longtime
friend and housekeeper at the Palm Springs home; Cary James, a
companion of Liberace's for six years before his death; Angie
Liberace, the only living sibling of the family; and Gladys Luckie,
the housekeeper at Liberace's Las Vegas home.

   Two billionaire families were joined in
matrimony in a union that one relative joked had to be approved by
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Laura S. Steinberg, 25, and Jonathan M. Tisch, 34, were married
Monday at the Central Synagogue. The reception, attended by more
than 500, was held in Great Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
   Mrs. Tisch is the daughter of Barbara and Saul P. Steinberg,
chairman and chief executive of Reliance Group Holdings Inc. The
bride's parents are divorced. Her stepmother is Gayfryd Steinberg.
   Tisch, president of Loews Hotels, is the son of Joan and Preston
Robert Tisch, president and co-chief executive officer of the Loews
Corp. and former U.S. Postmaster General.
   Steinberg and Tisch family members are major stock market
investors.
   The bridegroom's uncle, Laurence A. Tisch, is chairman of CBS.
At the bridal couple's engagement party last year, a member of the
Tisch family said, ``If they get married, it will have to be
cleared by the SEC.''
   It was a styish wedding, with a white-on-white bridal party of
26. The bride's dress, of off-white taffeta, with a 7-foot train,
was designed by Arnold Scaasi.
   The ceremony was performed by Rabbi Stanley Davis, senior rabbi
of the synagogue, under a canopy fashioned of bronze palms from
Steinberg's collection of antiquities.
   Among the guests passing through the receiving line were author
Norman Mailer, singer Beverly Sills, and Donald and Ivana Trump.
   The bride's mother said her daughter and son-in-law began dating
about three years ago. ``It just clicked,'' she said. ``I hope they
will always be as happy as they are today.''
   The bride, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, has a
Master's of Business Administration from New York University. Until
recently, she worked as a story analyst for Warner Bros. in New
York. The bridegroom graduated from Tufts University.

   The same day an Israeli court convicted
John Demjanjuk of war crimes, hundreds of Jews visited the
Treblinka Nazi death camp where 850,000 Jews perished in the gas
chambers he helped operate.
   As a cantor's mournful chant wafted across the vast open field
covering the camp's remains, the visitors searched Monday among
thousands of jagged memorial stones for the names of the Polish
towns where the victims had lived.
   ``My parents were killed here, my sisters, my brothers, an
uncle, an aunt were all killed here,'' said Jakub Silberstein, 64,
of Israel, who was wearing a striped concentration camp inmate's
cap.
   ``All I know is that if I had a gun, I would shoot Demjanjuk
with my own hands,'' Silberstein, a survivor of the Buchenwald and
Auschwitz concentration camps, said Monday.
   The court in Jerusalem ruled on Monday that the Ukrainian-born
Demjanjuk, a retired Ohio autoworker, was the notorious guard
``Ivan the Terrible,'' who helped operate the gas chambers at
Treblinka.
   The emotional pilgrimage for hundreds of Jews from Israel, the
United States and other countries followed observances of the 45th
anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.
   Accompanying the Israeli delegation was Jacek Wilczur, an
official with the Polish government's Nazi war crimes investigation
commission who assisted Israeli prosecutors in gathering evidence
for Demjanjuk's trial.
   ``Being here on this day has a symbolic significance,'' he said.
``It is not a trial of one Demjanjuk (that is important). It's a
trial of the German system of homicide.''
   On Tuesday, the Jewish visitors followed the last route of the
condemned Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto, traveling to Treblinka after
dedicating a new memorial at the Umschlagplatz, the site near the
railroad siding from which 300,000 Jews were deported to Nazi death
camps.
   Traveling by bus, they made the 53-mile trip to Treblinka,
northeast of Warsaw, in about 1{ hours.
   Forty-five years ago, the cattle cars packed with people
sometimes took several days to travel the same route.
   In 1942-43, a whole trainload of people could be undressed,
stripped of their belongings and killed in two hours. The 13 gas
chambers could kill 2,000 people in 10 to 15 minutes.
   The Nazis razed the camp to the ground after a bloody prisoners'
revolt on Aug. 2, 1943, and planted trees to hide the traces of
their crimes, which today give the site a strangely serene
atmosphere.
   The Polish government is now raising money to build a museum at
Treblinka, where there is now only a memorial of stones, erected in
1963, built to resemble a symbolic graveyard.
   At the center of the 23-acre site is a massive granite column,
resembling a tombstone, with a menorah, a traditional symbol of
Judaism, hewn into one side. In front is a stone with the
inscription in six languages: ``Never again.''
   ``My feet are planted on this land which has mixed on it the
ashes of 800,000 Jews who were brought here,'' said Chaika Grosman,
a member of the Israeli Knesset, or parliament, and survivor of the
1943 Jewish ghetto uprising in the Polish city of Bialystok.
   ``My nation was destroyed before my eyes and I was helpless,''
she said, speaking at a memorial rally in front of the monument
that was attended by about 1,000 Jews and Poles. ``I come here from
Israel as a pilgrim to the graves of my predecessors.''
   Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon of Israel said the only
positive answer to the Holocaust and Treblinka is ``increasing our
numbers'' and ``strengthening the state of Israel.''
   People walked among the 17,000 stones scattered in the field
surrounding the memorial column, 130 of which bear the names of
Polish cities and towns such as Biala Podlaska and Ostrow
Mazowiecki whose Jewish inhabitants were transported to Treblinka.
   Other stone markers are inscribed with the names of the 10
countries from which Jews were sent here _ Poland, Austria,
Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, Yugoslavia,
Germany and the Soviet Union.
   Some of the Jewish visitors also prayed by an open pit, filled
with melted black basalt, which stands in the place where the Nazis
burned the bodies of their victims.
   Walking back to the buses on this sunny, warm spring day, with
temperatures in the 70s, visitors could hear birds singing in the
fir trees surrounding the field of stones, which evoke such
terrible memories.

   A hydraulic problem forced a Fort
Myers-bound Eastern Airlines jet to use a backup system as a
precaution, but the plane landed safely, officials said.
   Flight 697 from Boston, carrying 115 passengers and six crew
members, landed shortly after 6 p.m. Monday at Southwest Regional
Airport, said V.H. Steed, a duty officer with the Federal Aviation
Administration in Atlanta.
   No emergency was declared, according to Steed and Virginia
Sanchez, a spokeswoman for Miami-based Eastern.
   After realizing there was a problem with the Boeing 707's
primary hydraulic system, the flight crew switched to the backup
unit, which functioned perfectly, Eastern shift manager Mike Hemmer
said.
   As of Sunday, FAA inspectors had checked about 200 of Eastern's
267 aircraft under an investigation announced last week. Whether
the Boeing 707 had been checked was uncertain, Eastern officials
said.

<HEAD>Peace Talks Suspended; Ortega Warns Against Stalling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUAN MALTES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High-ranking government and rebel
delegations agreed on a 10-day suspension of direct peace talks
after a fourth day of negotiations failed to produce a definitive
cease-fire pact.
   Also Monday, President Daniel Ortega warned that Sandinista
troops would continue fighting the U.S.-backed rebel forces if
rebel negotiators bowed to pressure from their top military
commander not to sign an accord.
   A joint communique issued at the end of Monday's talks said the
government and the Contras, as the rebels are known, would next
meet in Managua April 28-30 to continue negotiations to end their
6{-year-old civil war.
   The statement described talks between Sandinista officials and
leaders of the Contras' Nicaraguan Resistance organization as
``frank and cordial,'' and said the two sides had entered into
``permanent session'' to reach an accord.
   Contra leader Pedro Joaquin Chamorro told reporters that
government and rebel officials had agreed ``that at any moment we
can renew the negotiations to give continuity to this process.''
   ``We are certain the negotiations will end in success,'' said
Nicaraguan Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, who headed the
government's negotiating team.
   President Ortega, the defense minister's brother, charged that
Col. Enrique Bermudez, the Contra military commander, and the
United States were pressuring rebel negotiators to avoid a
cease-fire agreement.
   According to Ortega, Bermudez threatened the Resistance
directorate saying rebel military forces ``would liquidate them''
if they signed an agreement with the government.
   ``If this happens, it would leave us no other road but to
achieve a total victory in the military field,'' Ortega told
thousands of government supporters gathered in Managua's Plaza de
la Revolucion on Monday evening.
   Alfredo Cesar and Adolfo Calero, leaders of the Resistance
directorate, denied Ortega's claim. The directorate's six members
arrived in Managua on Friday for the first time since the civil war
began in November 1981. They left the country Monday evening.
   Officials from both sides declined to provide details on the
latest round of talks. Humberto Ortega said they were ``an advance
and not a failure,'' while Calero, the highest-ranking Resistance
official, told reporters that both sides were ``on the road to an
understanding.''
   Negotiations reportedly stalled over the issue of when the
Sandinistas would introduce democratic reforms in Nicaragua.
Arriving in Miami on Monday night, Calero said that would be the
top issue when talks resume.
   The Sandinistas insist the rebels sign a permanent truce
immediately. They say Contra delegates would then be allowed to
take part in a ``national reconciliation dialogue'' with leaders of
Nicaragua's 14 legally recognized political parties.
   Contra leaders demand the Sandinistas first carry out a series
of democratic reforms, or at least pledge to do so, before they
will sign a pact.
   The two sides signed a provisional agreement on March 23 which
provided for a temporary cease-fire while they negotiated a
permanent truce. A 60-day cease-fire went into effect April 1.
   The Contras on Monday proposed that the temporary cease-fire be
extended another month while both sides seek agreement. There was
no immediate government response.

<HEAD>Banks Reopen For First Time in 45 Days; Only For Deposits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULINE JELINEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Panamanian and foreign banks
opened for the first time in 45 days, but only to accept deposits.
One banker said the opening simply created the appearance that
Panama's financial system can recover.
   Business was brisk on Monday at a few major foreign banks, but
slow at institutions owned and operated by Panamanians.
   The Panama Banking Commission ordered the reopening as a first
step in the resumption of full banking services. Banks closed March
3 after a run on deposits, prompted by the ouster of President Eric
Arturo Delvalle which was orchestrated by strongman Gen. Antonio
Manuel Noriega.
   Panamanians have been unable to cash paychecks or gain access to
checking accounts since the closing and have conducted business on
a cash-only basis.
   The manager of a foreign bank, speaking on condition his name
not be used, said that Monday's limited reopening ``gives the
illusion that things are becoming normal. I don't know whether it
will work or not.''
   He said the move would ``allow circulation of checks _
reestablish the check as an acceptable payment in Panama.''
   He noted, however, that clients depositing checks still would
not be able to draw cash from their accounts unless the banks
resume full services.
   ``But if you owe money to someone and he will accept a check,
you can write a check on your new balance,'' he said.
   Even such a transaction would be guaranteed only if the partial
reopening works as envisioned under a complex set of rules issued
by the banking commission. Bankers said customers who made deposits
Monday should know by next week if the checks cleared and have been
credited to their accounts.
   Some financial sources predicted the new system wouldn't work as
long as Panama's cash crunch continues and the government fails to
resolve the political crisis that prompted the collapse of the
banking system.
   The Panamanian Banking Association, which represents most of the
more than 120 banks doing business in Panama, has said repeatedly
that its members will not resume full service until the government
can assure a steady, adequate supply of U.S. dollars, which Panama
uses as its official currency.
   Panamanians began withdrawing large sums of money begining Feb.
26, the day Noriega orchestrated the dismissal of Delvalle for
trying to fire him as chief of the armed forces and police. Noriega
is the head of the 15,000-strong Defense Forces and the power
behind the civilian government.
   In retaliation, the Reagan administration ordered economic
sanctions that included the freezing of Panamanian accounts in U.S.
banks and withholding revenues from Panama Canal toll fees.
   Noriega is under federal indictment in Florida on drug
trafficking charges, and the United States recognizes Delvalle as
Panama's legitimate president.
   Word of Monday's partial bank reopening had been announced in
newspapers through the weekend.
   About 30 people lined up outside the local office of Chase
Manhattan Bank before opening time Monday and another 10 were
outside the Citibank branch. Panama's private and government banks,
their solvency in question, appeared to be doing far less business.
   Except for the few who came with cash, customers said they were
depositing checks they had accumulated since March 3.
   Some customers expressed optimism that the limited reopening
might lead to the return of normal banking services in Panama.
   ``They're trying something new,'' said Frank Farrell, a former
Chase Manhattan employee who was depositing checks there. ``I don't
know if it'll work. It might. We'll give it a try.''
   But Farrell, like most others, was being cautious. ``Ill keep my
cash at home. Later on, maybe, I'll deposit cash.''
   A middle-aged Panamanian woman in the same line said she also
was depositing only checks. ``I need the cash to eat,'' she said.

   More than 300 safe-deposit boxes were cleaned out
after thieves cut a bank's alarm system and drilled a hole through
a concrete floor into the vault, police say.
   Everything of value contained in the boxes at the Liberty Bank
and Trust Co. in downtown Boston was stolen over the weekend,
police said.
   ``They knew just where they were going and acted in a
calculating and intelligent manner,'' said a police source The
Boston Globe quoted without naming.
   Bank officials and investigators from the FBI and Boston police
wouldn't comment, but the Globe quoted police sources as saying the
robbery was believed to have occurred over several hours Sunday.
   Bank President William Fitzgerald and investigators declined to
estimate the value of the loss.
   According to police, the thieves were believed to have gained
entrance to the bank's second floor through an emergency fire door,
although there was no evidence of forced entry. Several panels from
a dropped ceiling were pushed out, and alarm wires behind them
apparently were cut and a bypass wire slipped into place.
   The thieves entered an unlocked and empty second-floor vault,
from which they drilled a hole into the first-floor vault that
contained the safe-deposit boxes, the Globe reported.

<HEAD>Meeting With Penn State President A Beginning, Student Leader Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A meeting with Penn State University
President Bryce Jordan and his top administrators represents only
the first step for improving life for blacks at the school, says a
black student leader.
   ``I think the students are aware that this is just a beginning
and what's going to be needed is further organization, further
commitment and further negotiations,'' said Robert Blair, a
spokesman for the Black Caucus, a student organization.
   Before the meeting, Jordan announced he would withdraw
trespassing charges and the threat of university sanctions against
89 students arrested for a 15-hour sit-in that ended April 9.
   Blair and nine other black student leaders negotiated with
Jordan and four senior administrators for five hours Monday on
minority issues ranging from financial aid for blacks to creating a
vice president for minority affairs.
   ``I think we made some progress,'' Jordan said. ``There were
some things we had to say no to. There were some things we could
say yes to and some things we had to look at.''
   Jordan agreed to create a vice president for minority affairs
and also agreed in principle to work toward a goal of 8 percent
black student enrollment and faculty membership.
   Last fall, Penn State failed to reach a court-mandated goal of 5
percent black enrollment.
   Of the school's 67,000 students, a total of 2,424, or 3.6
percent, are black. Penn State has 57 black faculty members, or 1.6
percent of its 4,100 instructors.
   Jordan said he couldn't commit the university to more financial
aid for blacks.
   ``We think your arguments make good sense. ... We simply are not
going to make budget decisions in this setting,'' he said.
   Before the negotiations began, Jordan granted amnesty to the
protesters.
   More than 150 students occupied the telecommunications building
April 8 after Jordan canceled a meeting with student activists
because ground rules could not be reached in advance.
   Jordan had sent two administrators to meet with student leaders
behind closed doors, but the students demanded an open meeting.
   Students still in the building at dawn the next day were charged
with trespassing and faced university sanctions, including possible
dismissal.

<HEAD>Police Being Replaced After Rioting in Sungait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many police officers in the Azerbaijan city of
Sumgait are being replaced because they were incapable of dealing
with ethnic rioting that claimed the lives of at least 32 people,
an official said.
   Nikolai Demidov, deputy minister of internal affairs, said in an
interview Monday on the Vremya television news program that younger
people, many of whom recently served in the army, were replacing
the policemen. He did not say how many officers were being removed.
   Riots broke out in Sumgait on Feb. 28 and continued for three
days as Armenian demonstrators demanded annexation to Soviet
Armenia of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is part of the neighboring
Azerbaijan republic. About three-quarters of the residents of
Nagorno-Karabackh are Armenians.
   Soviet officials rejected the annexation demand but promised a
program to improve cultural and economic development in the area.
   Demidov said, ``Unfortunately, many Sumgait policemen were not
up to the extreme conditions'' during the rioting.
   He did not elaborate but balanced his criticism with praise,
citing a police Col. Filipov who he said blocked a mob from
attacking a bus.
   Soldiers and internal security forces sent to Sumgait to quell
the violence succeeded without firing their weapons, he said.
   Demidov said the death toll of 32 was correct, and repeated the
government and Communist Party claims the rioting was instigated by
criminal elements.

   Chinese authorities do not plan to reopen Tibet
to the thousands of backpackers who streamed through before
pro-independence protests began last year, a U.S. official said.
   ``The thrust of the message is Tibet is open and they intend to
keep it open but they intend to keep it (travel) in groups,'' said
J. Stapleton Roy, deputy assistant secretary of state, on Monday.
   Roy said that in talks with authorities during a four-day visit
to Tibet, they did ``not rule out'' the possibility of further
unrest in the region's capital, Lhasa.
   He said he carried no message from the U.S. government but
expressed concern for human rights in Tibet and pressed authorities
to allow more journalists and U.S. congressmen to visit.
   Roy said he did not discuss Chinese conditions for the return of
the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual and former political leader, who
fled to India in 1959.
   Individual travel into Tibet officially was halted shortly after
three protests in September and October by Buddhist monks and
others opposed to Chinese rule.
   Enforcement of the provision that all tourists to Tibet join
guided tour groups slackened early this year but has tightened
since a protest March 5 in which at least five people died.
   Chinese authorities alleged after the protests in September and
October that some foreigners joined in or encouraged participants.
   In 1987, 43,500 foreigners visited Tibet, spending $15 million,
according to official figures. Many arrived individually from
Chengdu in southwest China or overland from Nepal, which borders
Tibet.
   Roy said authorities told him future travelers would be required
to travel in groups charging at least $27 per day for expenses.
Such a restriction probably will discourage travel by youthful
backpackers on tight budgets who in the past often spent one or two
months at a time in Lhasa mingling with Tibetans without close
official supervision.
   He said there were ``at most a handful'' of foreigners in Lhasa
while he was there, Wednesday through Sunday. The Western-managed
Lhasa Hotel, with 476 rooms, has had only about two dozen guests at
a time since the protests began, he said.
   Nevertheless, Roy said local authorities claimed tourism had
increased 133 percent in the first quarter of 1988, with 1,184
visitors.
   Roy said Lhasa was not heavily patrolled by armed police, and he
encountered no roadblocks. ``The general impression is one of
surface normality, but you didn't have to dig deep to find views
that there was ... potential for future problems,'' he said.
   Roy said that when he raised the issue of U.S. concern over
reported human rights violations in Tibet, ``the response was that
we and the Chinese have differing views on the human rights
question.''
   China has denounced any criticism of its human rights policy as
interference in its internal affairs. It acknowledges holding some
political prisoners in Tibet, but denies charges they are
mistreated or that religious rights are not respected.
   Roy said authorities responded positively to his request that
more U.S. congressmen be allowed to visit Tibet. Four visited Lhasa
on April 7.
   He said officials told him journalists were allowed to visit if
they apply for permission. In practice, almost all reporters'
requests to visit Lhasa have been denied since last year's
protests, when 14 foreign journalists were expelled from Tibet.
   Chinese Communist troops entered Tibet in 1950, ending a
theocracy headed by the Dalai Lama.

   A federal judge imposed a 14-year
sentence on the political boss of a mountain coal mining county for
conspiracy as the county sheriff pleaded guilty to buying his job
for $100,000.
   ``I despise your acts of public corruption,'' U.S. District
Judge Charles Haden II said Monday while giving a maximum sentence
to former Mingo County Democratic Chairman Johnie Owens, a former
sheriff who admitted selling his job to Charles ``Eddie'' Hilbert.
   Hilbert resigned Monday and pleaded guilty to three felony
counts in a plea bargain, U.S. Attorney Joe Savage said. He faces
up to 13 years in prison and $351,000 in fines.
   Haden sentenced Owens to five years in prison plus a $10,000
fine on a conspiracy charge and three years each on three tax
evasion counts. All sentences are to be served consecutively, Haden
said, adding that to give a lighter sentence would ``minimize the
seriousness of your activity.''
   ``You sold that office. ... That is in and of itself a monstrous
crime,'' Haden told Owens, who pleaded guilty. ``There's no way to
sugar-coat that and say it should be understood in the context of
Mingo County.''
   The county is known historically as the site of the
Hatfield-McCoy feud and is at the center of political corruption
and drug trafficking in which nearly 50 public officials or
employees in southern West Virginia have been charged or convicted
in the last two years.
   ``If ever this cycle of corruption breeding corruption is to be
stopped, it has to be stopped with some signal event that will tell
the people of Mingo County who were slaves to the system that they
are free,'' Haden said.
   Owens also faces sentencing today in state court on two more
charges in connection with the same case. His plea agreement
indicates that those state sentences will be served at the same
time as the federal sentences.
   Haden set Hilbert's sentencing for June 13 in Huntington.
Hilbert, 45, pleaded guilty to mail fraud for backdating a
motorcycle accident report to protect an uninsured driver, failure
to report income he later used to purchase the sheriff's job, and
conspiracy to purchase the sheriff's job and use it to assist
relatives and business associates in illegal activities.
   Also sentenced Monday was former county Economic Opportunity
Commission Director Larry C. Hamrick, who pleaded guilty earlier
this year to one count each of conspiracy to possess marijuana with
intent to deliver, obstruction of justice and defrauding the
government.
   Hamrick, 47, of Williamson was sentenced to 12 years in prison,
just three years short of the maximum sentence, fined $2,000 and
ordered to repay the EOC, an anti-poverty agency, an amount yet to
be determined by federal auditors.
   The former Mingo County school board member also was indicted
two weeks ago, along with 14 other county political figures, on
charges of trying to control the 1984 county election by channeling
large amounts of money into Owens' political organization.

   Police used tear gas to
disperse hundreds of high school students who demonstrated in
support of the ``Sharpeville Six,'' a group of blacks waging a
court battle to escape the gallows.
   Police said tear gas was fired after youths outside a secondary
school threw stones at police vehicles in Mitchell's Plain, a large
township for mixed-race people outside Cape Town.
   Journalists said police ordered the protesters to leave and used
tear gas and batons to disperse other students marching to the
meeting.
   No injuries or arrests were reported in Monday's clash.
   Boycotts of classes were reported at mixed-race and black
schools throughout the Cape Town area. Some boycotters reportedly
protested the suspension of teachers while others supported the
Sharpeville Six, five men and a woman convicted of complicity in
the 1984 mob killing of black town councilor. The fate of the six
is in limbo while their lawyers seek to reopen the trial to
consider claims that police coerced a state witness.
   P.J. Van Zyl, registrar of the Pretoria Supreme Court, said on
Monday that the Transvaal Province attorney general's office was
studying the application to reopen the trial. He said a decision
would be made by April 27.
   A one-month stay of execution was granted March 17, a day before
the six had been sentenced to hang. The stay would have expired
Monday but was extended indefinitely last Friday when defense
lawyers submitted the application.
   Many Western and Soviet-block governments have sent appeals for
mercy for the Sharpeville Six. President P.W. Botha has refused to
commute the death sentences, saying he won't interfere in the
judicial process.
   No evidence was produced that the defendants contributed
physically to the councilor's death. They were convicted under the
doctrine of ``common purpose,'' which held them responsible for
being part of the mob that committed the killing during
anti-apartheid riots.
   Apartheid is South Africa's system of racial segregation whereby
the minority 5 million whites control the government and the
economy and the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.

   Jesse Jackson's popularity in the Democratic
presidential primaries hasn't translated into a single vote from
the party delegates in the U.S. Senate.
   Pose the question ``why'' to a Democratic member of that
all-white group, and you'll get a look as though you asked why it
doesn't snow here in July.
   It's not group racism, lawmakers and analysts say. It's
practical politics.
   ``A member of Congress has to look at it and see what's in it
for him,'' says Charles Cook, a columnist and observer of internal
congressional politics.
   Senate Democrats send 43 delegates to the party's national
convention in Atlanta. They are among the so-called super
delegates, who serve by virtue of their positions as party leaders
or elected officials.
   Of the 32 delegates picked in the Senate so far, Michael Dukakis
has nine; Sen. Albert Gore has five; Sen. Paul Simon, who
mothballed his campaign, has two, and 16 are uncommitted.
   Although Jackson is second in the overall delegate race to
Dukakis, he has zero. It can be a sensitive topic.
   Incumbent senators take a hard-nosed view of Jackson's chances
of actually becoming president. Backing a losing ticket would be of
no help to their own re-election chances _ or for the Democrats
retaining control of the Senate.
   ``There's a strong feeling that we've got to elect a
president,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who is committed to
Dukakis.
   ``We need to do all we can to come up with the best possible
slate,'' said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M. He's uncommitted, but says
``Dukakis has certainly shown he has support. That has to be a
major factor.''
   Thomas Mann, who studies government at the Brookings
Institution, says some senators may have concluded that Jackson
``has the capacity to excite blocs of voters in primaries but he'd
have an extremely difficult time being elected in a general
election.''
   ``I think you'd find any number of members of the House and
Senate embrace another black candidate,'' Mann said, mentioning as
an example an elected public official such as Rep. William H. Gray
III, D-Pa. Gray is supporting Jackson.
   Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., who beat a Republican incumbent two
years ago with the help of strong black support, is among the
uncommitted.
   ``I haven't sensed any (racial) prejudice,'' Fowler said,
pointing out the large number of uncommitteds. ``The whole concept
of super delegates is if the public has not made up their minds,
then we come into play,'' he said.
   ``I think most senators want this situation to go away. It's a
choice they don't want to make,'' said Cook.
   ``It's a choice between the people you want to keep in your camp
and the people you need to get in your camp to win. The Jewish
community ... was very much alienated by Jackson's remarks in the
past.''
   Mann said the senators are ``caught both ways.''
   ``They could be hurt politically by being prominently associated
with any kind of a stop Jackson movement,'' he said.
   The hope for senators is that the public will make a candidate
the inevitable nominee soon so the super delegates can simply
ratify the popular choice.
   With few primaries left, a big win for Dukakis in today's New
York contest could lead many senators to conclude that the public
choice has been made.
   ``I think if Dukakis manages to win ... the political conditions
will be created for the vast bulk of super delegates to end up in
the Dukakis camp in time for a first-ballot victory,'' said Mann.
   ``If he wins the primary by a significant margin, it's all
over,'' said Baucus.
   What if Jackson surprises Dukakis in New York?
   ``They're going to keep their powder dry certainly until the
convention,'' Mann said.

<HEAD>O'Connor Says He Hopes Visit Brings Cubans Closer to Christ</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TINA SUSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAVANA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government-controlled media has barely
mentioned that Cardinal John O'Connor of New York is visiting Cuba.
   O'Connor, the highest-ranking U.S. Roman Catholic leader to
visit Cuba in 29 years, said before leaving for the Caribbean
nation on Monday night that he hoped the trip would bring Cubans
closer to God.
   ``I ask that you remember me in your prayers, that my trip to
Cuba may bring our brothers and sisters there closer to Christ and
His Blessed Mother,'' he said Monday in a written statement in the
Dominican Republic. The archdiocese of New York provided reporters
with copies of the statement.
   O'Connor spent two days in the Dominican Republic and plans to
arrive in Havana today, after spending the night in the city of
Santiago, Cuba.
   There has been no mention of the cardinal's trip in the official
Communist Party daily Granma. A four-paragraph story appeared
Sunday in Juventud Rebelde (Rebel Youth), the newspaper of the
Young Communist League.
   O'Connor was invited to Cuba by the country's bishops to
commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth of the Rev. Felix
Varela, a Cuban priest who spent many years in New York and became
vicar general of the archdiocese.
   Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who came to power in 1959 and
established a communist government, recently has eased restrictions
on religious activities in the Caribbean nation.
   There was no word on whether O'Connor would get to talk to
Castro during his four-day visit.
   Earlier Monday, O'Connor addressed an AIDS conference in the
Dominican Republic with a plea that victims of the incurable
disease be treated with compassion and dignity.
   ``We have 17 Catholic hospitals in the archdiocese of New
York,'' the Roman Catholic prelate said. ``I have personally urged
that any person coming to any one of these hospitals seeking
assistance because of the possibility of AIDS be treated with
absolute, total and unconditional dignity.''
   ``I spend many nights in one of those hospitals, St. Clare's,''
visiting AIDS patients, he said. ``Often, I empty their bedpans,
comb their hair or mop their brow ... I have realized more and more
that every single one is a sacred human person made in the image
and likeness of almighty God.''
   Following his address at Catholic University in Santo Domingo,
the 68-year-old O'Connor flew by private plane to Cuba.
   Cuban Archbishop Jaime Ortega said in a newsletter made
available Monday that O'Connor's visit underlines the ``brotherly''
relations between Roman Catholic churches in Cuba and United States.
   To worshipers, he said, there is no such thing as one church
being more ``influential'' or ``powerful'' than another. ``These
adjectives have been taken from the language of international
politics and translated without thought sometimes to church
relations,'' Ortega said.
   Catholics account for 41 percent of Cuba's 10.2 million people,
as compared with 92 percent of the Dominican Republic's 6.6 million
people.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Bear Down On Southeast, Snow Forecast In Western
Mountains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms rumbled across the Southeast today after
destroying several mobile homes in Georgia, while a winterlike
storm threatened to dump heavy snow in higher elevations of
California and Nevada.
   Severe thunderstorms that developed ahead of a cold front Monday
night spawned hail the size of golf balls and damaging winds in
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia.
   The winds destroyed up to nine mobile homes west of Bainbridge,
Ga., Monday night, injuring three people, one seriously. The
sheriff's office said the wind left the homes in shreads.
   A major late-season storm was bearing down on northern
California, spreading rain across lower elevations and threatening
to bring heavy snow to the mountains.
   Winter storm warnings were in effect for the northern Sierra
Nevada range, the Mount Shasta area and northeastern California,
where more than a foot of snow was possible by sunset.
   In Nevada, a winter storm warning was issued for the Lake Tahoe
area with two to three feet of snow possible in the higher
elevations by tonight.
   The forecast for today called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the eastern Carolinas across Georgia and
northern Florida to the central Gulf Coast; scattered showers and
thunderstorms in California, with snow in the Sierra Nevadas; and
showers from Oregon to the northern Rockies.
   High temperatures were predicted to be in the 30s in upper
Michigan and western New York; in the 70s or 80s from southern
Atlantic states across the Gulf Coast, the southern Plains and New
Mexico; and in the 40s, 50s or 60s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 20
degrees at Fargo, N.D., to 76 at Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Higher In Europe, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose slightly in early European trading
today as markets awaited developments in the Persian Gulf. Gold
prices were lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers said Monday's initial flurry of
dollar-buying in response to U.S. and Iranian attacks in the gulf
had calmed down.
   But one dealer at a major West German bank in Frankfurt said any
new reports or rumors of clashes were likely to boost the dollar
significantly.
   Otherwise, traders said, the market's underlying bearishness
toward the U.S. currency would likely reassert itself.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.59 yen to a closing 124.37 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted fractionally lower at 124.35 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's
rates:
   _1.6624 West German marks, up from 1.6615
   _1.3755 Swiss francs, up from 1.3745
   _5.6495 French francs, up from 5.6410
   _1.86495 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8630
   _1,236.25 Italian lire, up from 1,234.37
   _1.2335 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2322
   In London, the British pound fell back from a six-year high
against the dollar. It cost $1.8915 to buy one pound, cheaper than
late Monday's $1.9015.
   Bullion dealers said trading was quiet as gold prices eased in
response to the dollar's slight gains.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $457.75 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $456.55. Both were down from Monday's late bid
of $459.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $456.75, down from $458.50 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 39 cents to close at a bid
$457.59.
   Silver also fell in London where it was selling a bid price of
$6.42 a troy ounce compared with $6.49 late Monday.

<HEAD>Doctor Says Teamsters Boss May Be Fit For July Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A physician selected by government lawyers to
examine Teamsters President Jackie Presser concluded he might be
healthy enough to stand trial July 12 on racketeering and
embezzlement charges.
   The government filed a doctor's report Monday prepared by John
J. Canary, a professor of medicine at Georgetown University in
Washington.
   Presser and two others are accused of participating in a
$700,000 payroll-padding scheme at Teasmters Local 507. U.S.
District Judge George W. White had set the July 12 trial date for
the three, saying that if Presser's health prevented him from going
to trial he would be tried separately.
   Presser's trial has been delayed twice because of pretrial
disputes between defense lawyers and federal prosecutors and
because of his health. Presser has been treated for a lung tumor
and a pituitary gland deficiency.

<HEAD>Ethiopia Allows U.N. To Resume Drought Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethiopia said U.N. aid workers can
resume drought relief operations in the war-torn north but that
more than 50 other Western workers remain barred from the region,
an official said today.
   The policy reversal, which affects only four of 60 Western
relief workers, came after a U.N. envoy met during the weekend with
President Mengistu Haile Mariam and the nation's highest relief
official, Berhanu Jembere.
   Undersecretary Martti Ahtisaari of Finland was sent to Ethiopia
to discuss the April 6 expulsions, which have crippled a massive
emergency program to feed 3.2 million starving people in the
northern provinces of Eritrea and Tigre.
   Tafari Wossen, information officer of the government Relief and
Rehabilitation Commission, said U.N. officials ``are definitely
strengthening their operation there.''
   In a telephone interview, Wossen quoted Berhanu as saying the
United Nations was never really included in the pullout of aid
workers and that ``it must have been a misunderstanding.''
   But the four U.N. employees were among 60 foreign aid workers
the Marxist government ordered out of Eritrea and Tigre.
   In an interview with The Associated Press last week, Berhanu
insisted his government would not allow even a skeleton staff of
U.N. or other Western aid workers to moitor food distribution in
the north.
   Two of the expelled U.N. workers returned today to the Eritrean
capital of Asmara with Ahtisaari, who also is to visit Mekelle, the
Tigrean capital.
   Secessionist rebels of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front
claimed on Monday they had killed 300 government troops and
captured or wounded 500 more on Sunday and Monday in a big battle
20 miles northeast of Asmara.
   U.N. officials in Addis Ababa said they could not immediately
comment on the government concession and its efects on the northern
relief operation.
   The government said it was evacuating the foreigners to avoid
``personnel risks.'' But relief officials and Western diplomats
accused Ethiopian officials of jeopardizing lives of millions of
drought victims and said they believed the government wanted to
remove witnesses from the war zone as it prepares for a massive
offensive against rebels.
   Eritrea, a former Italian colony on the Red Sea, was
administered by Britain from World War II until 1952 when it was
federated with Ethiopia under a U.N. resolution. Rebel groups have
been fighting for independence since Ethiopia incorporated it in
1962.

   Officials restored power to most of Quebec today
after an outage affected its 6 million residents and extended to
parts of New Brunswick province and scattered areas of Maine and
Vermont, a utility spokesman said.
   In Montreal, the outage trapped thousands of people in subways,
prompted looting and delayed a National Hockey League playoff game.
   Hydro Quebec, the provincial power utility, said it was not
known what caused the blackout, which began at 8:09 p.m. EDT.
   Jean-Guy Ouinet, a Hydro Quebec spokesman, said in a telephone
interview today that power was restored to most of the 6 million
residents of Quebec customers about six hours after the blackout
started. Ouinet said he did not know how many people were affected
outside the province.
   The blackout terminated television coverage of the Adams
Division opening hockey game between the Montreal Canadiens and the
Boston Bruins. The game at the Montreal Forum was interrupted in
the first period but then continued with the use of emergency
lights. Montreal won 5-2.
   Ouimet said the breakdown began on a power line between
Churchill Falls, Labrador, and the Arnaud generating station near
Sept-Iles, Quebec. Power was being restored slowly, he said.
   Hospitals and airports across the Quebec switched to emergency
generators, but reported no major problems.
   In downtown Montreal, looters smashed windows at a few stores,
but police Sgt. Alain Bousquet said looting was not widespread.
There were no arrests and no deaths immediately attributed to the
blackout.
   Ruben Volpo, owner of a Montreal fur store, said thieves had
stolen thousands of dollars worth of merchandise.
   ``I have a gun with a permit and if somebody tries to be funny
with me while I'm here, they better understand the consequences,''
he said.
   Cities on the New York side of the border were not affected
because the state does not operate on the same system, according to
a spokesman for New York State Electric and Gas.
   Gerry Morris, an official with the Vermont Electric Cooperative,
said about 800 homes in the Canaan and Norton areas were blacked
out for about an hour.
   The sale of Canadian hydropower to New England and New York has
become an important part of Quebec province's economy.

<TEXT>
   A baseball cap that was the wrong color
apparently sparked a drive-by shooting that left a 6-year-old girl
dead and four family members wounded, the girl's brother said.
   ``It started with this hat,'' said Martin Saucedo, 13, who
suffered a minor stomach wound in the attack Sunday night. An
argument with suspected gang members who tried to take his blue
Kansas City Royals cap apparently prompted the attack, Martin said
Monday after returning to his Compton home.
   ``The guys that jumped me said it was a gang hat and I should
give it to them. I said no, I bought it with my own money at the
Paramount swap meet and it was mine.''
   During a fight with a suspected gang member over the hat Sunday,
Martin's parents called deputies. But the gang members apparently
returned.
   Martin's sister Irma was struck in the chest and killed by one
of about two dozen bullets that ripped through the family's home
while they were watching ``America's Most Wanted,'' an anti-crime
television program, authorities said.
   The girl's parents, Salvador Saucedo, 39, and Maria Hernandez,
39, were wounded and were hospitalized in critical condition today,
said sheriff's Deputy Dan Cox. Her 7-year-old brother, David
Sanchez, and a cousin were reported in fair condition.
   Three other family members, including an infant, were unhurt.
   ``Shootings happen every night. I don't want to stay here,''
Martin's 16-year-old sister, Alexandra, said Monday as she sobbed
and clung to a photo of her slain sister.
   Authorities investigating the attack were seeking two gunman who
apparently fired a high-powered rifle and semi-automatic pistol
from lime green Cadillac, then fled.
   ``The investigation so far indicates it was a gang-related
retaliation shooting,'' said Deputy Hal Grant, ``although we're not
yet sure exactly who it was targeted against.''
   Martin Saucedo is not known to be a gang member, said Detective
R.M. Graves.
   Meanwhile, Mayor Tom Bradley warned in a speech Monday that the
police department's recent crackdown on gangs, which has included
weekend sweeps that have resulted in hundreds of arrests, will
continue.
   ``As mayor, I am resolved that we will not surrender one square
inch of people's turf to gangs and drugs,'' Bradley said. ``We are
in a war, and the enemy is within _ poisoning our children and our
neighborhoods.

   The Grammy Goose of babywear has won a
round in court against the Granny Goose of potato chips.
   ``I assume they'll go to trial,'' said Sandy Gotelli, who runs a
babywear store called Grammy Goose. ``After all, they've carried it
this far.''
   On Monday, a judge refused to order her to stop using the name
Grammy Goose, deciding against a preliminary injunction sought by
Oakland potato chip maker Granny Goose.
   Sonoma County Judge Lloyd von der Mehden said the company would
not suffer any ``dilution'' to its trademark if Gotelli continues
to use a logo at her business showing a bonneted goose with the
name ``Grammy.''
   He said that based on the evidence presented at a hearing in
February ``it is doubtful'' that Granny Goose could prevail at a
trial.
   Granny Goose attorney Katherine Spelman had no immediate comment.
   ``I'll have to talk with my clients,'' she said.
   The judge said that Gotelli would be hurt financially if she had
to change the name and logo of her store.

   Richard Nixon says incidents like the violence
in the Persian Gulf strengthen the presidential candidacy of George
Bush because when the United States is attacked the American people
rally around the administration.
   ``I don't think George Bush is going to make a political issue
out of this,'' the former president said Monday in an interview
with CNN. But, he said, Democratic contender Michael Dukakis ought
to join ``in making it clear to the Iranians they are confronting a
united United States on this issue and that we're not going to be
divided.''
   Nixon also said President Reagan should make it clear to the
Soviets that the gulf is ``an area we consider absolutely vital and
that eventually they are going to hurt their relations with us
unless they join us in trying to get this war brought to an end.''
   He described the Iran-Iraq conflict as ``not a war that we want
either side to win'' and added: ``There has never been a war in
which both sides deserved to lose more than this war.''

   A court today convicted Abbas
Hamadi and sentenced him to 13 years in prison for helping abduct
two West Germans in Beirut in hopes of forcing the Bonn government
to free his brother, TWA hijacking suspect Mohammed Hamadi.
   The 29-year-old defendant looked dejected after hearing the
sentence and slumped into his chair. He made no comment.
   Presiding Judge Klaus Arend said Abbas Hamadi was guilty of the
charges of kidnapping, coercion and possession of explosives.
   Alfred Schmidt, one of two West Germans kidnapped in the week
after Mohammed Hamadi's arrest, has been freed. Arend appealed for
the release of the second, businessman Rudolf Cordes, who has been
held since Jan. 17, 1987.
   ``Free Rudolf Cordes and show the world your own humanity,'' the
judge said.
   He condemned terrorism, saying: ``Terrorists work to bend other
people to their will.''
   Arend said that after Mohammed Hamadi's arrest at Frankfurt
airport in January 1987, Abbas Hamadi talked by telephone with
people in the Lebanese capital, including another brother, Abdul
Hadi Hamadi.
   ``After the capture of Mohammed Hamadi these men formed a circle
in Beirut who decided to do something to block the possible
extradition (to the United States) of Mohammed Hamadi,'' Arend said.
   In testimony at the trial, West German police said they had
monitored telephone calls made by Abbas Hamadi, who has lived in
West Germany for several years.
   Abdul Hadi Hamadi is Beirut security chief of Hezbollah, a
radical pro-Iranian Shiite Moselm group that is believed to be an
umbrella for the groups holding 22 foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   The 13-year prison sentence came as a surprise because
prosecutors had asked only for a sentence of 11{ years.
   Throughout the trial that began Jan. 5, Abbas Hamadi denied
having anything to do with the kidnappings.
   Prosecutors said Hamadi participated in the abductions in an
attempt to force the West German government to release Mohammed
Hamadi, who is being held on charges stemming from the 1985
hijacking of a TWA jetliner to Beirut. A U.S. Navy diver was killed
and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days in the hijacking.
   Defense attorney Ludwig Hoeller told the court last week that
Abbas Hamadi did not contest the explosives charges against him and
recommended that he be sentenced to one year in prison. But Hoeller
said his client should be freed because he had served more than a
year in investigative custody.
   Federal agents testified during the trial that Abbas Hamadi's
fingerprints were found on a letter Schmidt wrote to his mother
while he was being held hostage.
   Federal prosecutor Karl-Heinz Schnarr said in his closing
arguments that evidence did not link Abbas Hamadi directly to the
gunmen who abducted the Germans, but he said the defendant played a
role after the kidnappings.
   Mohammed Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13,
1987 while carrying liquid explosives. Abbas Hamadi was arrested in
Frankfurt on Jan. 26, 1987.
   Mohammed Hamadi was charged in February with murder, hijacking,
hostage-taking and other crimes connected to the TWA hijacking.
After his arrest, Abbas Hamadi admitted helping his brother hide
liquid explosives near Abbas Hamadi's home in Saarland state.
   The coercion charge against Abbas Hamadi stemmed from his
attempt to force the West German government to reject a U.S.
extradition request for his brother. West Germany denied the
request last year, but promised that Mohammed Hamadi would be put
on trial in West Germany.
   Last week, a Frankfurt state court said a juvenile court would
hear Mohammed Hamadi's case because he may have been under age 21
when the hijacking was being planned. The juvenile court could
still decide to try Mohammed as an adult.

<TEXT>
   A nasty legal fight that pitted New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo's son and a group of business associates against the founders
of a Florida savings and loan has ended with an out-of-court
settlement.
   In a joint statement issued Monday, the settlement with the
dissident shareholders was called ``economically attractive to the
shareholders, and operationally prudent for the Fensters,'' the
founding family.
   The family, which now owns 24.9 percent of the stock in
Oceanmark Federal Savings and Loan Association, will acquire the 37
percent interest in the institution owned by Andrew Cuomo and his
associates. Newspapers in Broward County reported that the price
was about $10 a share.
   Under the agreement, Lynn Fenster Smith will be reinstated as
acting chairwoman of the board. She was ousted in the battle over
the company.
   Smith, in a press release, said, ``The statements made in the
heat of the moment were unfortunate. I regret any personal hardship
this purely business dispurt may have caused Mr. Andrew Cuomo. I
have always considered him an outstanding professional.''
   The parties and their attorneys agreed, as part of the
settlement, that they would have no further comment on the
settlement or its terms, which are subject to the approval of the
Federal Home Loan Bank.
   The Fensters founded the thrift in North Miami Beach in 1986.
   Lynn Fenster Smith filed suit in December against some dissident
shareholders of Oceanmark, charging that thay had moved to assume
control of the institution without going through proper federal
channels.
   After Ms. Smith filed suit, Andrew Cuomo countersued, accusing
her of libel and defamation.
   ``The settlement will allow us to return to the business of the
thrift,'' said Ms. Smith.
   Sheldon Goldstein, the largest minority shareholder and a Cuomo
associate, said that ``two years ago, we thought that we could all
work together to build a strong institution.''
   ``Unfortunately, sometimes even relationships forged with the
best of intentions don't work out,'' said the Rockland County,
N.Y., real estate developer.
   Andrew Cuomo, 30, is a Manhattan lawyer who also has been his
father's chief political adviser since the elder Cuomo's successful
run for governor in 1982.

<HEAD>Nuclear Arms Policy Prompts Political Crisis in Denmark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANK POWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prime minister today called
parliamentary elections to resolve a political crisis over the
country's ban on peacetime nuclear weapons.
   Prime Minister Poul Schlueter said a more strictly enforced ban,
which the leftist opposition approved last week, ``goes beyond the
limit where Denmark's full membership in NATO is put in danger.''
   Britain and the United States, fellow members of the military
alliance, have criticized the tighter ban. Britain has threatened
to forgo NATO maneuvers in Denmark.
   Schlueter, who heads a governing center-right coalition, called
the elections for May 10.
   In the latest elections in September, his four-party coalition
lost seven seats to control 70 of the parliament's 179 members. It
has kept enough support on economic issues to command a majority
but lost 23 votes on defense issues since Schlueter took office in
1982.
   The opposition's new policy requires the government to notify
visiting warships that nuclear weapons are banned in Danish ports.
Until now, Denmark has simply announced a general policy and
assumed individual foreign vessels were observing it.
   Defense Minister Bernt Johan Collet has said the reinforced ban
would be put in abeyance until after the election.
   The new ban fell short of measures adopted by New Zealand
demanding that ship captains affirm their vessels have no nuclear
weapons. That policy prompted the United States to break off
military cooperation with the south Pacific nation.
   Schlueter said today Britain had vowed to bow out of military
maneuvers to practice reinforcing Denmark in wartime because it
would have to disclose whether its ships carried nuclear weapons.
   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said Friday the U.S.
government was ``deeply distressed'' with the new Danish ban. He
said the U.S. policy of never disclosing the presence of nuclear
weapons ``is central to the U.S. ability to fulfill its NATO
commitments. We are not going to change it.''
   NATO Secretary General Lord Carrington also said the Danish
action could have ``extremely serious consequences'' for the
16-nation alliance.

   There's something missing from the
carved marble figure of Jim Bowie on the 60-foot shrine to Texas
heroes that stands in front of the Alamo.
   It's the tip of his nose.
   The disfigured face of Bowie, among the best known of the 189
defenders of the Alamo, was discovered Monday when members of a
wreath-bearing procession took part in an event known as the
Pilgrimage to the Alamo.
   Repairs are expected to begin in two weeks, after a grandstand
is removed from Alamo Plaza, officials say.
   The solution? Glue.
   Although vandalism is considered a possibility, officials also
say the marble might have flaked off.
   ``After 50 years, if that's the only damage, that's not too
bad,'' said Alamo Curator Emeritus Charles J. Long said.
   Long, a sculptor and curator of the Pompeo Coppini-Waldine Tauch
Studios, where the Cenotaph was made, discovered the damage Feb.
12, while walking by the Alamo on his way to eat lunch at a nearby
restaurant.
   ``I saw his nose was missing as I walked by, and I looked around
and found pieces of it on the ground,'' Long said.
   Long informed officials of the San Antonio Parks and Recreation
Department and current Alamo Curator Steve Beck, but the damage did
not become public knowledge until Monday.
   ``The tip of the nose is in good shape. It just needs to be
glued back on,'' Long said. Long said the tip can be glued with
ordinary epoxy cement. Marble dust will be mixed with the cement to
fill in gaps.

<TEXT>
   A flaming engine blamed for the crash-landing of
a Horizon Air turboprop last week had emitted a strong odor of fuel
before an earlier flight, an investigator said.
   National Transportation Safety Board member Joseph T. Nall,
heading the investigation of Friday's accident here, also discussed
other engine problems suffered by de Havilland Dash-8s at a news
conference Monday night.
   The crash-landing injured 19 of the 40 people aboard as it
smashed into a passenger ramp at Seattle-Tacome International
Airport. The plane was one of 10 Dash-8s in the Horizon fleet.
   Pilot Carl Carlson also told investigators of a maintenance log
entry April 8, a week before Friday night's crash, that described a
strong fuel odor coming from the same engine that caught fire
Friday night, Nall said.
   ``There was some maintenance done and nobody complained of the
smell after (the April 8 report),'' Nall said.
   Nall noted that in 1987 an engine fire in a Horizon Air de
Havilland Dash-8 had forced an emergency landing.
   And Nall said that Carlson told NTSB investigators that a
different Dash-8 turboprop he was flying earlier this month
suffered a brief power loss in one of its Pratt & Whitney engines.
   Nall said although the engine immediately regained power,
Carlson aborted that flight and landed. Carlson told the safety
board he understood from other pilots that such a problem ``was not
uncommon but it was certainly not a regular occurrence,'' he said.
   ``The investigation is obviously intense at this point,'' Nall
said.
   The June 1987 engine fire aboard involved fuel spilled into the
engine cowling and forced the plane, which had taken off from
Sea-Tac, to make an emergency landing at Boeing Field, Nall said.
   Horizon Air changed maintenance procedures after that fire, Nall
said, adding, ``We don't know at this point if the (June '87 and
the latest fire) are related.''
   ``...The direction and focus of the investigation is obviously
to determine why there was the fuel in the right (cowling over the
engine) _ passengers noted there was fuel there before the crash _
and the cause of the ignition of that fuel,'' Nall said.
   Passengers in the plane that crashed Friday told investigators
they could see fuel accumulated on the right wing.
   The Dash-8 engine is made by Pratt & Whitney Canada, and Nall
said the NSTB planned to take a long, hard look at all U.S. planes
with similar engines.
   Horizon Air President John Kelly said Monday that airline crews
checked engines on the company's fleet of Dash-8s, but found no
problems that would have led to a fire like the one that preceded
Friday night's crash.
   Three of the 19 injured passengers remained hospitalized Monday.

<HEAD>Billy Graham Says China Promoting Religion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American evangelist Billy Graham today praised
Chinese leaders, saying they are working to broaden freedom of
religion in their country.
   ``There's no complacency here that I've found among the
leaders,'' said Graham, who is taking his first trip to China.
``They admit that there are serious problems in implementing the
constitutional guarantee of freedom and something must be done
about it.''
   The 69-year-old evangelist, who has taken his religious message
to more than 60 countries, made today's comments to foreign
reporters in Beijing.
   Graham, who has preached while in China and held talks with
leaders, praised the country's leadership for recognizing
shortcomings in defending the rights of believers and acknowledging
that religion can play a role in the moral development of the
nation.
   During the first three decades of communist rule in China,
places of worship were destroyed and believers persecuted. Religion
suffered especially during the 1966-76 ultra-leftist Cultural
Revolution.
   The government now guarantees religious freedom, but it allows
only state-sanctioned religious groups and forbids prosyletizing.
   Chinese religious officials say there are about 4 million
members of the state-approved Protestant church and more than 3
million Catholics affiliated with the Patriotic Catholic Church.
Thousands of unaffiliated believers are also thought to worship at
home.
   Graham, who on Sunday preached to more than 1,500 worshipers in
a Beijing Protestant church, said he felt there was ``a possibility
of a very positive turn of events for believers in this country.''
   ``I seem to sense here that there is a desire on the part of
leaders for a moral and spiritual rebirth or rejuvenation,
something to give purpose and meaning to China today.''
   During his week in Beijing, Graham has met religious leaders,
scholars, students and government officials, including Premier Li
Peng.
   Graham confirmed an official Chinese report that quoted Li as
saying that China needs spiritual as well as material development
to prosper.
   Graham declined to say whether he discussed with officials the
issue of Christians and other believers who have been imprisoned
for their religious activities. Catholics in particular have been
jailed for defying the government policy of cutting all ties to the
Vatican.
   However, Graham said he was told religious leaders are holding
discussions on drafting a law on religion and the state. ``This
would help diminish both official and popular attitudes of
intolerance and discrimination,'' Graham said.
   He was to leave Beijing today for coastal Jiangsu province to
visit the village where his wife Ruth, the daughter of
missionaries, was born and spent her youth.
   Graham was also scheduled to speak at a Christian seminary in
Nanking and preach at a church in Shanghai. He will visit Canton
before leaving China on April 28.

   Security at Fort Campbell Army Base
has been tightened because of clashes between U.S. forces and
Iranian forces in the Persian Gulf, but the Army's chief of staff
said no Army personnel were being alerted for combat duty.
   Residents and personnel on the base have been asked to be alert
to ``suspicious and inquisitive strangers,'' unidentified vehicles
and abandoned cars or packages, and to keep unused areas around
home and work secured.
   ``This is FORSCOM-wide,'' Maj. Randy Schoel, public affairs
officer for the 101st Airborne Division, said Monday. ``We have not
been singled out,''
   FORSCOM, or the U.S. Army Forces Command, directs the activities
of about 950,000 active and reserve troops, about two-thirds of the
Army's ground combat forces.
   Schoel said he did not know of any specific threats to military
installations that might have caused the extra precautions.
   Gen. Carl E. Vuono, on a routine visit to the base to assess the
readiness and training of the troops here, declined Monday to
speculate if there was a possibility Army personnel might be called
to combat.
   ``There are no plans to deploy the 101st to the Persian Gulf,''
he said, adding that the Army could execute any mission and that
soldiers are ``ready to go on a continuous basis.''
   Only Navy and Marine Forces have been involved in the Persian
Gulf action so far.

   Contract negotiations between scriptwriters
and producers broke off again after a meeting with a federal
mediator and no new talks are scheduled in the six-week-old strike.
   Each side accused the other of intransigence Monday. The
deadlock could affect the networks' announcement next month of
their fall schedules, with production of new shows and their pilot
episodes thrown into question.
   The Writers Guild of America had requested a meeting with the
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which the
guild struck on March 7 over issues of residual fees from foreign
markets and hourlong shows sold into syndication.
   ``They had nothing new to offer. They said, `We have no change
in our position,''' alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg said of
Monday's meeting. ``They just called the meeting to tell us that. I
don't understand it.''
   But Guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said the alliance,
representing about 200 studios and producers, insisted that writers
accept their final offer from March 6, the day before the
9,000-member union struck.
   ``At a time when the industry is at a standstill, the guild
regrets the companies' unwillingness to deal seriously with
writers' proposals and to continue to negotiate,'' Ms. Rhoden said.
   She said the session presided over by federal mediator Leonard
Farrell lasted only 20 minutes.
   Until writers are willing to discuss the producers' final offer,
``We saw no reason to continue the meeting, or to schedule another
meeting,'' said Steinberg.
   Producers have said several times that they are standing by
their final offer. The alliance has said its proposal would raise
writers' pay by $50 million over three years, even though it would
reduce residual payments for some one-hour TV shows.
   Writers say their own analysis of the offer shows it would
result in a loss of more than $37.8 million for its members.
   The strike has caused several television shows, such as
``Moonlighting,'' ``L.A. Law,'' and ``The Cosby Show,'' to fall
three or four shows shy of a full seaso3ptk.WkKkCC

   Ibrahim Hussein made Boston Marathon history with
a one-second winning margin, while Rosa Mota was five minutes ahead
of her nearest competitor as she scored her second consecutive
victory.
   Hussein, of Kenya, bolted past fellow East African Juma Ikangaa
on Monday with 100 yards left, becoming the first African to win
the 26-mile, 385-yard race.
   His margin surpassed the two-second victories of Bill Rodgers
over Jeff Wells in 1978 and Alberto Salazar over Dick Beardsley in
1982.
   Hussein won in 2:08:43, the second fastest time in Boston. Rob
de Castella finished in 2:07:51 in 1986. Hussein was within two
minutes of the world record of 2:06:50 set by Ethiopia's Belayneh
Dinsamo in Sunday's Rotterdam Marathon.
   Mota, of Portugal, completed Monday's marathon in 2:24:30,
compared with her 1987 winning time of 2:25:21. She was five
minutes ahead of her competition.
   In the wheelchair competition, Moussetapha Badid of France beat
the world record by 6 seconds with a time of 1:43:19.
   The marathon had a heavy international flavor since the top
Americans plan to run in the U.S. Olympic Trials. They will be held
next Sunday in New Jersey for men and the following Sunday in
Pittsburgh for women.
   Hussein and Mota each won $45,000 and a car valued at more than
$35,000. The 92nd running of the world's oldest marathon drew about
6,700 official entries.

<TEXT>
   Iraq fired missiles into Tehran and other
Iranian cities today as Iranian warplanes blasted the Faw
peninsula, which the Iraqis recaptured in a major land offensive.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said one
long-range missile was fired into Tehran, one into Shiraz and a
third into Isfahan, the 16th century capital of the Persian Empire.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia,
reported the missiles crashed in residential neighborhoods, killing
and wounding civilians. It gave no casualty figures.
   Iraq has fired 135 missiles into Tehran, 22 into Isfahan, two
into Shiraz and 22 into Qom, seat of Iran's religious hierarchy,
since the resurgence of the so-called ``war of the cities'' Feb. 29.
   Iran says it fired 59 such projectiles into Baghdad, the Iraqi
capital, and dozens into other Iraqi cities in the same period.
   Tehran Radio reported Iranian warplanes staged 16 successful
bombing raids on Iraqi positions in the Faw peninsula.
   Iraqi troops, led by the Presidential Guard, retook Faw and
forced the Iranians to retreat to the eastern flank of the Shatt
al-Arab waterway in a two-day battle. Iran had occupied the
peninsula in an offensive in February 1986.
   It was the first time Iraq had launched a major ground offensive
since the early years of the 7{-year-old war.
   There were no reports of major ground combat in the region today.
   Thousands of Iranians were killed or wounded in the thrust,
named ``Blessed Ramadan'' after the Moslem fasting month, the Iraqi
News Agency reported.
   ``Victorious Iraqi armed forces entered Faw town today and
hoisted the Iraqi flag,'' the state-run agency reported Monday.
   Salvos of gunfire thundered over Baghdad and other Iraqi cities
and people took to the streets to rejoice, the agency said.
   Iranian state-run news media on Monday charged that U.S.
helicopters attacked Iranian troops to support the Iraqi offensive.
It accused Washington of ``direct involvement'' in the gulf war.
   Pentagon officials denied the claim.

<TEXT>
   A cafeteria that fired an employee for having
an ``extreme'' hairdo refuses to re-hire her despite a formal
complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``If her hairstyle is in conformity with our policy, then she
can have her job back,'' said John Fountain, an attorney for
Mobile, Ala.-based Morrison Inc., which fired Renee Randall April 4
from its Morrison Cafeteria in Annapolis.
   Ms. Randall, 19, says she had been told not to return to work
until she changed her long ponytail ``cornrow'' hairstyle.
   ``Not only is this policy ridiculous but it is discriminatory
against blacks,'' Stuart Comstock-Gay, executive director of the
Maryland ACLU chapter said at a news conference Monday to announce
the complaint filed with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission. ``It ay not be intended to be racism, but black girls
are the only ones who wear this style.''
   Ms. Randall, 19, wears her hair in tightly braided cornrows with
a ponytail in the back, Comstock-Gay said in an interview. ``The
fall-back part is a black-red, black-orange _ there is a slightly
different hue to it.''
   Fountain said by telephone that the company objects to the
ponytail, not to Ms. Randall's cornrows.
   ``Apparently it was the ponytail that was standing on her head
about six or eight inches,'' Fountain said. ``And the color of the
hair was different than that of her normal hair, which combined to
make the hairdo extreme.''
   Fountain said another employee in the Annapolis store has a
cornrow hairstyle that is acceptable.
   Ms. Randall said she knew of no customers who had complained
about her hairdo before she was removed from her job. She paid for
the hairstyle and she shouldn't be forced to change it to please
her employer, she said.
   ``She certainly wants her job back and we're going to try to
convince (Morrison's Cafeteria) to give her her job back,''
Comstock-Gay said.
   Ms. Randall has not talked with Morrison management since she
was told to leave April 4, he said.
   Morrison Inc. operates more than 150 cafeterias, primarily in
the South and East, Fountain said.
   Comstock-Gay said if the complaint before the EEOC runs its full
course, it may be six months or longer before a decision is
rendered. ``I think she may have to look for (another job),'' he
said.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, trying to end
confusion over his position on fighting in the Persian Gulf, said
today the U.S. action against Iran ``was appropriate under the
circumstances.''
   The Massachusetts governor, who was looking for a victory in
today's presidential primary to propel him toward the nomination,
greeted subway commuters in Queens and stopped for a visit at the
T-Bone Diner before returning to Boston.
   Dukakis made a brief statement to reporters on the Persian Gulf
situation but took no questions on the issue during a news
conference on the steps of the diner. On Monday he had told one
reporter he considered the U.S. action a ``measured response'' but
then refused to comment at two news conferences.
   ``Based on the facts that I have, I think the president took the
appropriate action,'' he said today. ``It was a measured response.''
   He said it was ``a responsibility of the international community
to do something about'' the long Iran-Iraq war in the region. He
mentioned an embargo on shipments of arms.
   Dukakis called the New York campaign ``a wonderful experience.''
   ``I hope I can do well today and win today, and I hope I can
come back as the nominee,'' he said. ``It's been a terrific,
exciting, interesting couple of weeks and I hope if all goes well
today a sign of things to come.''
   Dukakis was returning to Boston for the day before traveling to
Philadelphia's Democratic Party Dinner in the evening, an event
held one week before Pennsylvania's presidential primary. He
planned to return to New York to be with supporters when the
state's primary returns are counted tonight.
   Campaigning back and forth across the state on the eve of New
York's primary, the Democratic front-runner generally refused to
speak with reporters about the quickly changing developments in the
Middle East.
   But aides confirmed he told one reporter early in the day that
he considered the U.S. attack on the platforms a ``measured
response,'' language considered supportive of the action.
   When reporters traveling with him asked for explanations,
Dukakis declined to come talk to them on the plane and sent two
aides to respond instead.
   Madeleine Albright, campaign foreign policy adviser, said that
because events were shifting so rapidly, ``he felt he didn't want
to continue with the initial statement.''
   Asked if he had withdrawn the statement or stood by it, she
said, ``A combination of several series of escalations makes one
question whether it was an appropriate reaction.''
   As he departed his campaign jet a final time in New York Monday
night, Dukakis turned away from a reporter who asked about the
issue. Dukakis referred the questions to campaign press secretary
Mark Gearan, who had already told reporters, ``Given how the story
has developed, he's withholding comment.''
   The 11th-hour flap came against a backdrop of caution by the
candidate, who could go a long way toward the nomination with a
victory in New York, and following a campaign in which rival Albert
Gore Jr. accused the Massachusetts governor of displaying foreign
policy inexperience.
   Dukakis urged crowds throughout his final full day of
campaigning in New York to ignore polls showing him in the lead and
to help get other supporters out to vote, saying turnout would be
the deciding factor.
   ``I pay no attention to polls, and I hope you pay no attention
to polls,'' he told college students in Rochester.
   At a lunchtime rally in Manhattan, Dukakis appeared with his
actress cousin Olympia Dukakis and spoke optimistically.
   ``Here on the eve of the New York primary, I just want to say to
all of you that I'm grateful for your support, grateful for all
you've done, and we're looking forward to a great victory tomorrow
here in the state of New York, and we're going to get it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Coroner Claims Secret Service Agent Terrorizing Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A county coroner has accused a U.S.
Secret Service agent of subjecting him to ``utter terror'' in an
effort to block an inquest into the death of the agent's
2{-year-old daughter.
   The federal agency's Atlanta office said no disciplinary action
is planned against the agent.
   Agent Robert E. Edwards of Duluth, northeast of Atlanta, has
filed a lawsuit seeking to block an inquest by Gwinnett County
Coroner Randy Simpson into the death of his daughter, Brittany Leah
Edwards, arguing there is no evidence of foul play.
   Snellville and Gwinnett County police officers said in
affidavits filed in that lawsuit that Edwards told them he was
conducting his own investigation of Simpson, the Gwinnett Daily
News reported Sunday.
   Among other things, Edwards said he was checking whether Simpson
had paid his taxes, the officers said in the affidavits.
   Simpson accused Edwards of ``abuse, harassment and utter terror
to me and my family.''
   Edwards told the newspaper he did not abuse his position.
   ``In no way did I ever insinuate that it was an official Secret
Service investigation,'' he said.
   William R. Hoskyn, who heads the Secret Service office in
Atlanta, said ``our people looked at it'' and found no reason to
discipline Edwards.
   Asked in a Monday night telephone interview if the matter is
closed, Hoskyn said, ``At this point, right.''
   Brittany died Aug. 24. Records at Joan Glancy Hospital show
Edwards said he had given her a hot dog for supper and that she
regurgitated parts of it when he gave her mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation after his wife found her in bed with no pulse.
   Both Simpson and Medical Examiner Gerald Gowitt initially told
police they found ``nothing remarkable'' about the case, but
Simpson later sought an opinion from Fulton County Associate
Medical Examiner Saleh Zaki.
   Zaki said he found no evidence that the child choked on
partially chewed food. Gowitt now says no explanation for the death
has been found.

<HEAD>Man Who Once Hit Justice White To Be Tried on Child Sex Abuse
Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAYTON, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who once punched a U.S. Supreme Court
justice to protest pornography is facing trial on felony charges of
aggravated sexual abuse of a child and showing harmful material to
a child.
   Newton C. Estes, 62, Kaysville, was bound over for trial
following a hearing Monday before 4th Circuit Judge K. Roger Bean.
   The charges, filed Jan. 25, involve an 11-year-old girl who
worked as a housekeeper at the Estes home.
   Estes is charged with showing the girl pictures of nude people
and asking her to assume the same poses. The girl said that on one
occasion, Estes removed her clothes, fondled her and gave her an
extra $5 in wages, court documents said.
   Estes recently asked Bean to drop the charges because news
coverage of his previous and current court involvement was damaging
his ability to make a living in Utah. He asked the charges be
dropped so he could sell his house and move out of the state.
   The judge said it was not appropriate for him to be involved in
negotiations of this type.
   Estes was fined $500 and sentenced to 10 days in jail and two
years probation after he punched Justice Byron R. White three times
during a Utah State Bar convention in Salt Lake City on July 15,
1982. White suffered a minor abrasion of the cheek.
   Estes said the attack was to protest court rulings on
pornography and school busing. ``He's causing four-letter words to
come into my living room through the TV set. The only way I know
how to stop it is to go to the source,'' he told reporters at the
time.

<HEAD>Two Women Discharged From Marines Because Of Lesbianism
Investigation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARRIS ISLAND, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two women have been discharged from
the Marine Corps as a result of a continuing investigation of
lesbianism at the Marine Corps Recruit Training Depot, a Corps
spokesman said.
   The women, whose names were not released, were given honorable
discharges, Maj. Robert McLean, the depot's public affairs officer,
said Monday.
   ``Although not charged under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice, the two were administratively discharged by reason of
homosexuality as provided for in accordance with Department of
Defense policy,'' said McLean, who said he didn't know how long
they had been in the Corps.
   ``Under the circumstances in their case, their conduct in the
opinion of the command did not warrant judicial action. However,
their conduct was contradictory to established standards of conduct
and specifically violated DOD policy on homosexuality,'' McLean
said.
   The Department of Defense operates under a policy that
``homosexuality is incompatible with military service,'' and the
uniform code makes homosexuality a crime.
   The women, discharged Friday, were the first released as a
result of the investigation, which started in December and
primarily involves the Fourth Recruit Training Battalion, where all
female recruits are trained.
   Five other women have been charged with indecent acts and are
involved in criminal proceedings.
   A hearing for one of those women, Cpl. Barbara J. Baum,
concluded Monday when a Beaufort County sheriff's deputy testified
he found his former girlfriend, a Marine, in bed with Ms. Baum.
   Ms. Baum, 23, of Mishawaka, Ind., has been charged with indecent
acts with women, sodomy and obstruction of justice. She has been
suspended from her military police duties at the depot.
   After reviewing testimony from the two-day hearing, the hearing
officer will make a non-binding recommendation of action to Ms.
Baum's commanding officer. Recommendations could range from a
court-martial to no action.

   A 9-year-old girl was injured by lightning
as she stood near a stove at her home during a storm, officials
said.
   Pat Bradley, deputy director of the Houston County Emergency
Managency Agency, said Shannon Jones of Cottonwood was hurt Monday
night when ``lightning hit a stove and then jumped to her.''
   ``She was knoocked down and there was a loud pop,'' Bradley
said. ``The girl's parents called the police, who notified medical
services and the girl was taken to the hospital.''
   He said the girl, who complained of pain in her side and a
headache, was taken to the Southeast Alabama Medical Center, where
she was treated and released.
   The lightning accompanied a tornado sighted by National Weather
Service radar moving southwest through south Houston County about
7:30 p.m., emergency officials said.

<HEAD>Court Says Development of California Forest Does Not Violate
Indian Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's planned development of part
of the Six Rivers National Forest in California does not violate
Indians' religious rights, the Supreme Court ruled today by a 5-3
vote.
   The court's dissenters said the ruling ``leaves Native Americans
with absolutely no constitutional protection from perhaps the
gravest threat to their religious practices.''
   The decision revived the federal government's plans to harvest
timber in one section of the forest and to upgrade a road linking
the towns of Gasquet and Orleans.
   A federal appeals court had ruled that such development would
represent a constitutionally impermissible interference with the
religious rights of three Indian tribes.
   But writing for the high court today, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor said, ``Even if we assume (the development) will virtually
destory the Indians' ability to practice their religion, the
Constitution simply does not provide a principle that could justify
upholding (their) legal claims.''
   Six Rivers, encompassing about 956,000 acres in northwestern
California, was designated a national forest in 1947.
   The portion of the forest involved in the legal dispute is in a
region between the Smith and Klamath rivers known as the ``high
country.'' It is considered sacred by the Yurok, Karok and Tolowa
tribes.
   The U.S. Forest Service has proposed upgrading a 75-mile road
between Gasquet and Orleans to accommodate the hauling of timber
and to enhance public access to that part of the forest.
   Twenty miles of the road is located on non-federal land and is
maintained by Del Norte County, Calif. According to government
lawyers, the Forest Service has spent about $17 million upgrading
49 of the road's 55 miles over federal land.
   But a six-mile stretch of the road, in the Chimney Rock section
of the forest, remains unpaved and is accessible only six months a
year.
   Forest Service plans to complete the road and allow the
harvesting of timber in the ``high country'' region were challenged
by members of the three tribes, various environmental groups and
state authorities.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1986 found that ``the
high country is indispensible to a significant number of Indian
healers and religious leaders as a place where they receive the
`power' that permits them to fill their religious roles that are
central to the traditional religions.''
   Although the development would not intrude on any sites of
Indian religious ceremonies, the appeals court said the development
indirectly would ``produce an irreparable impact.''
   In enacting the California Wilderness Act of 1984, Congress
designated most of Six Rivers National Forest as a wilderness area.
Since commercial activities are prohibited in such areas, timber
harvesting generally is banned.
   But the 1984 law exempted a narrow stretch of land from the
wilderness designation ``to enable the completion of the
Gasquet-Orleans road project if the responsible authorities so
decide.''
   In rejecting the Indians' religious-freedom argument, O'Connor
said that ``nothing in our opinion should be read to encourage
governmental insensitivity to the religious needs of any citizen.''
   ``The government's rights to the use of its own land, for
example, need not and should not discourage it from accommodating
religious practices like those engaged in by the Indians.''
   She noted that government officials had ``taken numerous steps
in this very case to minimize the impact that construction of the
road will have on the Indians' religious activities.
   Voting with O'Connor were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens and Antonin Scalia.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry A.
Blackmun dissented.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not participate in the case.
   Writing for the dissenters, Brennan said the court's ruling
``essentially leaves Native Americans with absolutely no
constitutional protection against perhaps the gravest threat to
their religious practices.''
   ``I find it difficult to imagine conduct more insensitive to
religious needs than the government's determination to build a
marginally useful road in the face of uncontradicted evidence that
the road will render the practice of (the Indians') religion
impossible,'' Brennan said.
   The case is Lyng vs. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protection
Association, 86-1013.

   Jesse Jackson hailed a victory in Delaware as
the ``hors d'oeuvre'' before today's presidential feast in New
York, while Michael Dukakis hoped the New York primary results
would be ``a sign of things to come'' and make him the clear
front-runner Democrats have sought.
   Turnout in New York City was described as quite heavy as voting
began on a cool, dry day.
   At an East Harlem polling place, Jackson said his victory over
Dukakis in Delaware caucuses Monday night ``is another evidence of
how broad our support is. Delaware was the hors d'oeuvre, New York
is a four-course meal.''
   Dukakis gtreeted commuters at a Queens subway stop and said, ``I
hope I can do well today and win today, and I hope I can come back
as the nominee. It's been a terrific, exciting, interesting couple
of weeks and I hope if all goes well today, a sign of things to
come.''
   The Massachusetts governor, also seeking to end confusion over
his position on the fighting in the Persian Gulf, said U.S. action
against Iran was ``appropriate under the circumstances.''
   Dukakis made a brief statement to reporters on the Persian Gulf
situation but took no questions on the issue. On Monday, he told
one reporter he considered the action a ``measured response,'' then
refused to comment at two news conferences.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., needing a surprise showing to salvage his
debt-ridden candidacy, shook hands with commuters arriving in
Manhattan at Penn Station.
   With strong support from the state's large black electorate,
Jackson was hoping for an upset that would allow him to claim the
status as front-runner.
   Bea Dolen, executive director of the New York City Board of
Elections, described turnout as quite heavy throughout the city.
   She predicted it would top 50 percent and said, ``I'll have to
wait and see later if it goes above 60.''
   About 2.5 million of the state's 3.5 million eligible Democratic
voters live in the city.
   Pollsters, while saying the Massachusetts governor had a lead of
anywhere from 10 to 17 points, also were warning about the
volatility of the race.
   ``We could all be wrong. New York is a killer,'' said ABC News
pollster John Brennan.
   Heading into the New York race, Jackson scored a win in
Delaware's Democratic caucuses Monday night, beating Dukakis 45
percent to 27 percent. Gore had just 2 percent. But the Delaware
contest was dwarfed by the big New York primary, with its prize of
255 Democratic delegates.
   Untroubled by any doubts about his grasp on the Republican
presidential nomination, Vice President George Bush was expected to
sweep the 96 GOP delegates at stake today in New York.
   For Dukakis, New York offered an opportunity to break away from
his pursuers and finally establish himself as the front-runner as
the race moves on to Pennsylvania next Tuesday and Ohio, Indiana
and the District of Columbia the week after that.
   The latest Associated Press delegate count gave Dukakis 877,
Jackson 745, and Gore 417. A total of 2,082 was needed for a
convention majority.
   The New York campaign was marked by an emphasis on candidate
views on the Middle East and by the long shadows of two
non-candidates _ Gov. Mario Cuomo and Mayor Edward Koch.
   Turnout in today's polling was critical, and all three
Democratic contenders spent the final hours of campaigning urging
their supporters to go to the polls.
   ``If you stand in the rain today, you will vote in the rain
tomorrow,'' Jackson told supporters in Harlem on a wet Monday.
``We've come too close; nothing can stop us now.''
   ``Just don't forget to vote tomorrow,'' Dukakis told his backers.
   Gore campaigned with Koch, whose attacks on Jackson often got
more attention than the sparring between the candidates.
   During the campaign, the mayor said Jews and other supporters of
Israel ``would have to be crazy'' to vote for Jackson. Koch also
said the former civil rights activist lied under pressure and would
lead the Democrats to their worst defeat since 1972, when
Republican Richard M. Nixon carried 49 states.
   Koch was asked repeatedly about his weekend comments criticizing
Jackson. ``I'm not saying he's a liar. I'm saying he can't stand
stress, and then he lies under stress,'' he said.
   Jackson tried to avoid being drawn into a running battle with
Koch, but said at a news conference Monday that ``we have received
more death threats in this campaign than in all the other combined
because the climate has been so divisive and so violent.''
   ``The name-calling and the accusations and the attempts of a
provocation by the mayor have not been good for the city or the
campaign,'' Jackson said.
   Cuomo, who praised all three contenders but endorsed none, said
that Koch's tactic of ``attacking Jesse Jackson's character'' might
boomerang.
   ``Jackson is not getting enough whites,'' said pollster Lee
Miringoff, chief of the Marist College Institute for Public
Opinion. And he said Gore ``does not appear to have gotten into the
numbers where he will close the margin.''
   Polling Sunday and Monday by ABC and the Washington Post found
Dukakis rebounding after losing some ground Friday and Saturday.
The combined Sunday-Monday results were: Dukakis, 51 percent,
Jackson, 34 percent and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. 9 percent.
   A CBS News survey Saturday and Sunday had a narrower spread,
with Dukakis at 43 percent, Jackson at 33 and Gore at 12. A Gallup
poll done Friday through Sunday put the race at Dukakis 45, Jackson
32 and Gore 10.
   The ABC-Post poll had a 6-point margin of error, CBS's 4,
Gallup's 5.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people from around the world
joined Polish officials today in offering flowers and prayers to
the memory of fallen anti-Nazi warriors of the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto
Uprising.
   The 45th anniversary ceremony took place on a broad plaza in
front of the Ghetto Fighters Monument in Warsaw, where the sounds
of gunfire echoed on the morning of April 19, 1943.
   Heavily armed squadrons of German Nazi troops that day entered
the walled Jewish quarter bent on quick, final annihilation of the
last 70,000 inhabitants. Instead, they were routed, and the
starving, poorly armed residents held off Nazi troops for three
more weeks.
   ``We have to remember, yes, but not a paralyzing memory,''
Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon told the crowd of about
4,000 people in English. ``Not only remember the past, but we
should derive a new determination from that tragedy to continue
living.''
   Navon, whose visit to Poland is considered private, expressed
thanks to Polish authorities for the ceremony. The two countries do
not have full-fledged diplomatic relations.
   Six million Jews were put to death in the World War II
Holocaust, 3 million of them Polish.
   Earlier today, about 100 Arab and African students carrying
Palestinian flags briefly marched through the city, also to
commemorate the Ghetto fighters.
   The students drew parallels between the ghetto battles and the
4{-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip. The protesters distributed leaflets to passers-by,
recounting what they said were Israeli cruelties.
   Before the official ceremony, Henryk Jablonski, chairman of the
Polish veteran organization Zbowid which organized the observance,
planted an oak tree on the plaza as a symbol of hope.
   Then, to the beat of military drums, delegations from veterans,
Jewish, and Polish groups laid wreath after wreath of flowers at
the foot of the monument, a relief of armed fighters crouched
together facing their foes.
   The monument, near the city's heart, was the first erected on
the destroyed left bank of Warsaw after the war.
   As Poles and Israelis stood side by side around the square, a
cantor sang Kaddish, the Jewish song of mourning. Rabbi Isser
Frankel of Tel Aviv prayed for the victims of the ghetto and the
Nazi Holocaust in Poland.
   Later, when the Polish officials and military honor guard
withdrew, Israelis in the crowd burst into singing of their
national anthem.
   About 3,000 people from Israel and around the world came to
Poland for the observance week, which began Thursday.

<HEAD>New Arms Treaty Remains Elusive As Shultz Leaves For Talks In
Moscow</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Top 2 grafs new on Shultz departure; picks up 3rd graf pvs,

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz left today
for talks in Moscow to try to eliminate differences in U.S. and
Soviet drafts of the new arms control treaty to slash long-range
nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   Shultz was scheduled to depart at 8 a.m., but a mechanical
problem with his Air Force jet delayed the takeoff until 10:36 a.m.
   About half of the 1,200 disputed items identified by American
and Soviet negotiators are technical and could be resolved if major
verification problems are worked out, Reagan administration
officials said Monday.
   But the others have proved intractable so far, involving the
detection and counting of elusive mobile and cruise missiles
carried on planes and warships, said the officials, who spoke only
on condition of anonymity.
   Officials acknowledged that hopes were fading for the treaty to
be ready for signing at the May 28-June 2 summit meeting in the
Soviet capital.
   ``There's always hope,'' an official said. But he said there has
been virtually no progress in resolving differences between the two
sides since Shultz met in Washington last month with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   The official blamed a lack of cooperation on the Soviet side.
``I`m not one for bashing the Soviets,'' the official said in an
interview. ``But they're not exactly following through on the
problems. And look at the calendar.''
   Shultz is flying to Helsinki and will go on to Moscow on
Thursday for three days of talks with Shevardnadze and a session
with General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He will also make
stops in Kiev and Tblisi, the capitals of the Ukraine and Soviet
Georgia.
   Shultz will brief officials of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization in Brussels on Monday and then return home.
   The monthly meetings are in preparation for President Reagan's
visit to Moscow for talks with Gorbachev May 29-June 2. Reagan
would like to crown his fourth and probably final superpower summit
meeting with a treaty to reduce long-range bombers, missiles and
submarines by 30 to 50 percent.
   But a senior U.S. official, briefing reporters under rules of
anonymity, said four drafts prepared by American and Soviet
negotiators had 1,200 distinct items of disagreement bracketed.
   The drafts deal with verifying the reductions, disposing of
banned weapons, an exchange of information on U.S. and Soviet
arsenals and the treaty itself. A fifth and separate draft deals
with space-based defenses.
   ``The longer time goes by without solving these issues, the more
unlikely there will be a signing in Moscow,'' the official said.
``But we'll keep trying.''
   The Reagan administration is insisting on a strict verification
system. This requires procedures for monitoring what the other side
retains in its arsenal.
   Shultz also will talk to Shevardnadze and Gorbachev about other
subjects including the Iran-Iraq war, the Middle East and human
rights.
   Since last July he has tried and failed to persuade the Soviets
to join in calling for an international arms embargo against Iran
in order to force a cease-fire in the 7{-year war in the Persian
Gulf.
   This has kept the United States from pressing the issue in the
United Nations Security Council since the Soviets have the power to
veto any resolution.
   In the Middle East, Shultz wants the Soviets to accept a limited
role in a peace conference. King Hussein of Jordan and President
Hafez Assad of Syria would prefer the Soviets be active in shaping
a settlement, while Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir objects
to their involvement since the Soviets usually side with the Arabs
in Middle East disputes.
   On human rights, the senior official said Shultz would try to
make Soviet emigration easier. The United States wants the Soviets
to drop a provision for denying a visa if another family member
objects and to ease restrictions on applicants involved in
sensitive work in the past.

   A 33-year-old man stabbed his estranged
wife with a hunting knife early today, then killed himself with a
shot to the head from a high-powered nail gun, police said.
   Patricia Lecam, 28, survived and fled through her bedroom window
to a neighbor's house with her three young children, police said.
She was in fair condition at a hospital this morning, officials
said.
   Deputy Chief William Mulligan said police heard what sounded
like a single gunshot when they arrived at the home in response to
a report of a burglary in progress at 1:08 a.m.
   A search turned up William Lecam's body lying in the woods about
150 yards behind the house, Mulligan said. He had shot himself in
the head with a nail gun, Mulligan said.
   Nail guns are used in construction to save time. Most are driven
by compressed air fed through hoses, but Mulligan said this one
apparently used cartridges containing a small explosive charge.
   Lecam had been arrested in February on charges of assaulting his
wife, Mulligan said.

<HEAD>Court Makes it Easier to Recover Debts Owed by Dead People in
Oklahoma Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today made it easier for
creditors to recover debts owed by dead people.
   The justices, voting 8-1, revived a claim by an Oklahoma bill
collection agency that said it unfairly was denied the chance to
recover part of a hospital bill owed by a former patient who died.
   The agency, Tulsa Professional Collection Services Inc., is
seeking to collect $14,657 from the family of the late H. Everett
Pope Jr.
   Pope ran up a $142,000 bill at St. John Medical Center in Tulsa
from Nov. 23, 1978, until he died the following April 2. Insurance
covered all but the amount sought by the bill collector.
   Pope's family published a newspaper notice to creditors after
his will was admitted to probate in July 1979.
   Oklahoma law requires that any creditor claiming money from an
estate file such a claim within two months of the probate notice.
   Tulsa Professional Collection Services, which missed the
deadline, said it was denied due process because it was not
notified directly of the probate proceedings.
   The Supreme Court today said the agency has a legitimate case.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in her opinion for the court, said
if the Pope family knew about the collection agency or could have
determined its identity by a reasonable effort it was required to
notify the creditor directly _ by mail, for example _ about the
probate proceedings.
   The court set aside a decision by the Oklahoma Supreme Court in
favor of the Pope family and ordered further lower court
proceedings to determine whether the Pope family knew the
collection agency was owed money or whether the agency's identity
was ``reasonably ascertainable.''
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist dissented.
   The case is Tulsa Professional Collection Services vs. Pope,
86-1961.

<HEAD>Judges Unhappy With Proposed Sentencing Guidelines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New guidelines designed to eliminate
disparity in sentencing will deprive judges of their independence,
say some federal jurists who met to consider the issue.
   The U.S. Sentencing Commission, organized in 1984 as an arm of
the federal judiciary, adopted the sweeping guidelines last
November in an attempt to end the disparities in criminal
sentencing.
   ``They're cold and implacable and as immutable as a computer,''
said U.S. District Judge James Ideman, one of 20 federal judges who
met Monday.
   Donald A. Purdy Jr., representing the commission, said the
guidelines were developed to increase respect for the law by
ensuring that defendants are sentenced fairly. He cited a 1974
study of 50 judges that found sentences for the same crime ranged
from three to 20 years.
   The U.S. Supreme Court will make the final determination on the
guidelines.
   Several of the judges expressed irritation at the notion of any
independent commission fixing sentencing options for federal judges.
   The guidelines, proposed at Congress' direction, established a
range of penalties for all federal crimes that occurred after Nov.
1. Minimum and maximum penalties do not vary more than 25 percent
and judges aren't permitted to deviate unless a case involves
factors not considered by the commission.
   The controversial guidelines have prompted divided opinions from
district judges throughout the country.
   Opponents have argued that the commission, as an arm of the
judicial branch, did not have authority to assume what has been a
function of the legislative branch.
   ``What it does is it destroys all the discretionary function of
a judge and it gives an opportunity for prosecutorial
misbehavior,'' U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian said Monday.

<HEAD>Drug Charge Dropped Against Prime Minister's Ex-Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors today dismissed charges of marijuana
possession against Margaret Kemper, the ex-wife of former Prime
Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau.
   Ms. Kemper had been charged March 17 after Royal Canadian
Mounted Police used a search warrant to seize a package at her home.
   Federal prosecutor Keith Ward said a defect in the warrant would
have made successful prosecution impossible.
   A copy of the search warrant used at Ms. Kemper's home said an
informer in British Columbia told police Ms. Kemper would be
receiving a pound of marijuana through the mail in eight separate
packages.
   Ward said the problem with the warrant was that the marijuana
was not delivered until sometime after the warrant was signed. He
said the pollice officer who requested the warrant had told the
court that the marijuana had been received.
   Ward said he had decided to drop the charge.
   ``I am the prosecutor, the one who received the case,'' Ward
said. ``This was my decision.''
   He denied any suggestion that Ms. Kemper received special
treatment.
   ``It has been treated like any other three-dash-one (possession
charge) as far as is possible,'' Ward said. ``I've never seen so
much press interest in a three-dash-one.''
   Ms. Kemper, 39, did not have to appear in court on the charge. A
conviction could have carried a maximum fine of $1,000 or six
months in jail or both, although lesser penalties are usually
imposed.
   Trudeau and his wife were divorced in 1983. She married Ottawa
real estate developer Fried Kemper the following year, with whom
she has one son.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against Minnesota Welfare Recipients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ruled against a group
of Minnesota welfare recipients who said they were given inadequate
notice about a change in their eligibility for federal benefits.
   The court, voting 5-3, said states are not required to provide
advance written notice about the effects of 1981 changes in
eligibility requirements of the Aid to Families with Dependent
Children program.
   Under the AFDC program, states determine a family's eligibility
after calculating its income and resources.
   Prior to 1981, when an AFDC recipient received a lump sum of
money from any source _ such as an insurance settlement or lottery
winnings _ the money was treated as income in the month received
and as resources in succeeding months.
   Congress in 1981 changed that policy in an attempt to discourage
quick spending of windfalls, providing that lump-sum income is to
be prorated over a period of months. The change generally limits
the eligibility after a family receives lump-sum income.
   A group of Minnesota women who receive AFDC benefits sued state
authorities in 1983, contending that they were not given advance
notice about the lump-sum rule or the 1981 change in that rule.
   A 37-year-old Minneapolis woman, Kathryn Jenkins, is the lone
remaining named plaintiff in the ``class action'' lawsuit.
   In October 1983, the Jenkins family received a $5,752 disability
check. Raymond Jenkins, a former Metropolitan Transit Commission
bus driver, wrote checks the same day to cover back mortgage
payments and an overdue car-repair bill.
   The family also spent about $600 on children's clothing and
other items.
   Although the disability payment was quickly spent, the Jenkins
family was declared ineligible for AFDC benefits for eight months.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in late 1986 that
imposition of the lump-sum rule on the Jenkinses was unfair because
no advance notice of the 1981 rule change had been received.
   Today, the nation's highest court disagreed and gave Minnesota
authorities a legal victory by reversing the appeals court ruling
on what a federal notice regulation requires.
   ``The regulation simply requires the state to publish a general
description of the basic structure of the AFDC program and its
availability,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court.
   He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, Byron R.
White, Harry A. Blackmun and Antonin Scalia.
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall dissented.
   Writing for the three, O'Connor said she thought the disputed
notice regulation ``requires the (Minnesota) Department (of Human
Services) to give applicants for AFDC benefits written notice at
least of the existence of the lump-sum rule and of the need for
recipients to consult with a social worker before spending any lump
sum they might receive.''
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not participate in the case.
   The case is Gardebring vs. Jenkins, 86-978.

   Israeli today deported to Lebanon six
Palestinians who were involved in a fatal clash with Jewish
settlers in a West Bank village, the army said.
   Two other Arabs were expelled from Israel and flown by an army
helicopter to Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in south
Lebanon, the army reported.
   The deportations raised to 20 the number of Palestinians
expelled since the start of the Palestinian uprising Dec. 8. More
than 1,000 Arabs have been deported since 1967.
   So far, 167 Palestinians have died in the unrest, according to
U.N. figures. Two Israelis also have been killed.
   The army accused the deported Palestinians of inciting and
organizing disturbances in the occupied West Bank. It said they had
appealed to an army review board but did not take their case to the
Supreme Court.
   Army officials said the six Beita residents were involved in a
stoning attack against 16 Jewish teen-agers and two armed guards
from a nearby West Bank settlement on April 6.
   A settler girl and two Beita residents were killed in the clash.
An army report said the girl was killed by a bullet fired from the
weapon of one of the Jewish guards.
   The army has destroyed the homes of 13 Beita residents linked to
the stoning attack.
   Hanna Siniora, a prominent Palestinian editor, said the
deportations were a message that Israel ``wants to continue the
occupation and is disregarding Palestinian national rights.''
   ``Such a policy will inflame the situation and actually add to
the determination of the Palestinian people in their struggle for
their national aspirations,'' said Siniora, editor of the pro-PLO
daily newspaper Al Fajr.
   The United States has condemned deportations, saying the measure
violated the Geneva Convention which bans the transfer across
borders of civilians living in occupied zones.
   Israel, which has not accepted the applicability of the
conventions to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, has defended the
practice, saying only mass expulsions were barred and that such
punishment was less severe than execution, permitted by the
conventions.
   Also today, an Israeli Cabinet minister criticized the slaying
of PLO commander Khalil al-Wazir, warning it would backfire on
Israel. The army censored a newspaper editorial about Israel's
reported role in the assassination.
   Soldiers sealed off parts of the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip and clamped a curfew on 17 towns, cities and refugee camps
for a third straight day to quell rioting in the occupied
territories, the military said.
   Nineteen Palestinians have been killed since Saturday's slaying
of al-Wazir, who was second in command to Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat.
   Israeli sources have confirmed that Israeli commandos shot and
killed al-Wazir at his home in a Tunis suburb. The nation's leaders
have so far refused to comment.
   NBC television reported Monday that Mossad agents, naval and
army commandos carried out the assassination, reaching their target
by sea.
   The report said the operation was approved at a Cabinet meeting
last week, with two dissenters, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and
Cabinet Minister Ezer Weizman.
   In an interview with Israel radio today, Weizman, a former
defense minister, refused to comment on whether Israel onducted the
assassination, but said:
   ``It doesn't contribute to the fight against terrorism. In
principle it creates more. It distances the peace process and will
bring greater hostility and make us more vulnerable around the
world.''
   Al-Wazir's body was flown to Syria today. His funeral is
scheduled for Wednesday.
   Israel's military censor, meanwhile, took a rare step and
censored an entire editorial by the mass-circulation Yediot Ahronot
daily which newspaper sources said dealt with Israel's role in
Al-Wazir's killing.
   The editorial appeared as a blank white space with only a title
that read: ``They Are Silent But Speak.'' Dov Yudkovsky, the
newspaper's editor, declined to comment on the action.
   Also today, the Israeli-appointed mayor of Nablus, Hafez Tuqan,
declined to comment on media reports that he planned to resign from
his post because of the 4{-month-long uprising in the territories
Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East War.
   A leaflet published this month by the pro-PLO underground called
on Tuqan and other Israeli-appointed municipal officials to leave
their jobs.
   Tuqan stepped in as Nablus mayor in March 1986 after
Israeli-appointed Zafer Al-Masri was assassinated by pro-Syrian
extremists.
   Nablus, the West Bank's largest city with 120,000 residents, and
16 other towns and refugee camps in the West Bank have been under
curfew since Sunday.
   Jelazoun, a Palestinian refugee camp near the city of Ramallah,
has been under curfew for 34 days, the longest curfew on a camp
since the uprising began Dec. 8.
   Soldiers initially barred even United Nations relief officials
from delivering food to the camp's 5,000 residents.
   But today, the army allowed three relief trucks carrying
sardines, corned beef, beans, cooking oil, powdered milk and rice
to enter the camp, according to Bill Lee, a spokesman for the U.N.
Relief and Works Agency.

<HEAD>Bakker Writes Letter, Wants PTL Back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former PTL evangelist Jim Bakker has
written letters to a U.S. bankruptcy judge, PTL's trustee and
supporters asking for a chance to save the troubled ministry, a
newspaper reported.
   ``I believe it's time we have the chance to help save the
ministry God gave us a vision to build,'' Bakker said in the letter
obtained by The Charlotte Observer. ``Please let Tammy and me,
along with the partners who worked so hard to birth PTL and
Heritage USA, fight for its right to continue.''
   Bakker made the plea to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds,
trustee David Clark and PTL supporters. Bakker said the letter came
in response to PTL's financial crisis and Reynolds' decision Friday
ordering the ministry at Fort Mill, S.C., to begin planning its own
liquidation.
   ``I once again ask for your forgiveness and for restoration,''
Bakker wrote. ``I beg those who have the future of PTL in their
hands, before Heritage USA is torn apart and sold, please let the
founders have ninety days to try, under God, to save what I believe
to be a God-given vision.''
   The two-page letter also touches on the financial troubles that
have plagued PTL since Bakker resigned in March 1987 after
acknowledging a sexual encounter with Jessica Hahn and the payment
of hush money to her.
   Bakker and his former top aides are under investigation by a
federal grand jury in Charlotte for possible mail, wire and tax
fraud. The investigation is focusing on how PTL spent millions of
dollars in contributions under Bakker's leadership, and whether
Bakker and his associates broke federal laws against raising money
for one purpose and using it for another.
   The Internal Revenue Service claims PTL owes at least $55.7
million in back taxes and wants to revoke its tax exempt status.
   PTL spokesman David West said Monday that Clark would have no
comment because PTL is pursuing legal action against the Bakkers.
   Bakker's attorney says the former evangelist plans to come to
North Carolina within the next six weeks to meet with state
Assemblies of God officials and to seek forgiveness. The
denomination defrocked Bakker nearly a year ago.
   Lawyer Jim Toms called the move a ``peace-making mission,'' and
said Bakker hopes to ``right whatever wrongs that can be righted.''
   Toms said Bakker is not interested in reinstatement to the
Assemblies of God.
   ``He's not asking for a job,'' Toms told the Observer. ``It's
expressly designed not to request anything of them except
forgiveness. He wants to clear the air and say `I'm sorry things
went badly.'''

   A suburban police chief's undercover activity for
the FBI has resulted in federal gambling indictments of the mayor
and two other men, prosecutors say.
   ``I've taken an oath to follow the law,'' Police Chief Anton
Graff said on Monday, ``and I feel nobody is above the law, even
the mayor.''
   Mayor Kenneth Fisher of Dixmoor was charged Monday with
conspiracy to commit racketeering, racketeering, lying to a federal
agent and obstruction of justice, said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Steven Miller.
   The mayor was accused of taking bribes to allow a gambling
operation in the town for five years, Miller said.
   Benjamin Laster of Downers Grove and Samuel Perry of Calumet
City were indicted on charges of racketeering and conspiracy,
prosecutors said.
   Miller would not comment on the nature of the alleged gambling
operation, but Graff said it was primarily bookmaking on horse
races.
   The indictment said the operation was based at two taverns, one
of them owned by Laster.
   Valukas called Graff the hero of the operation, saying the
police chief was offered bribes by Laster to protect the gambling
operation, but notified the FBI of the bribe attempt.
   Graff began secretly working for the FBI in March 1986,
officials said.

<HEAD>Harris Asks Bennett To Stop `Wall Chart' Comparisons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Joe Frank Harris says a federal ranking of
state education efforts is unfair and incomplete, and he wants the
Education Department to stop its annual ``wall chart'' comparing
state-by-state improvements.
   The report ``fails to acknowledge the diminished role of the
federal government in improving education, while holding individual
states up to public criticism for failure to meet unspecified
federal expectations,'' Harris said in a letter to Education
Secretary William Bennett.
   ``Premature reporting on education programs, improvements and
achievements is discouraging to those who are implementing major
reforms in public education. ... Such improvements can only be
reached by long-term committment,'' Harris said in the letter,
mailed Friday and distributed to reporters Monday.
   Bennett has been using the wall chart for five years to show the
educational performance of each state.
   In the latest chart, released in February, Georgia was 20th in
combined Scholastic Aptitude Test scores, 48th in graduation rates,
44th in per-pupil expenditure, 40th in student-teacher ratios and
27th in average teacher salaries.
   Harris' letter, which was drafted by state education officials,
complained that the Education Department's statistics are wrong. It
repeated complaints about using SAT scores, saying the test is
weighted more as a college admissions test in some states than
others.
   It said the teacher salary comparisons do not take into account
each state's cost of living, and it noted that some states include
general equivalency diploma holders as high school graduates.
   Valena Plisko, director of elementary and secondary planning at
the U.S. Education Department, defended the chart, saying it ``has
been effective in prodding the states to improve their
performance.''

might not have been quite as successful had the founders of this
Tennessee River city picked a different name 150 years ago.
   After all, ``Pardon me, boy, is that the Montevideo choo choo?''
doesn't really sing, does it?
   Montevideo was one of several possibilities considered by land
commissioners when they were naming the new town at Ross's Landing
in 1838, says James Livingood, a Hamilton County historian.
   Other nominees were Lookout City, Albion and the eventual
winner, the Cherokee Indian word for ``rock coming to a point,'' a
reference to Lookout Mountain.
   ``There was spirited debate,'' Livingood said Sunday during a
program marking Chattanooga's 150th birthday.
   The commissioners settled on Chattanooga, Livingood said,
because one observer noted that although the sound of the name was
perhaps outlandish, the city's success would make the name
``pleasant and familiar, and, besides, there will be not another
like it anywhere in the world.''
   That prediction didn't exactly pan out _ there is a town in
Oklahoma with the same name _ but Chattanooga has come a long way
in the last century and a half, say those who have governed it in
recent years.

   A 9-year-old girl whose frostbitten lower legs
were amputated after she was abandoned in an unheated building
walked out of a hospital today, and doctors said she had most of
the abilities and all the energy of a cheerful youngster.
   Darlwin Carlisle, who has been fitted with artificial limbs,
limped very slightly but smiled and held two dolls when she walked
down the front steps of La Rabida Children's Hospital.
   She was accompanied by her great-grandmother, Katie Carlisle,
her aunt, Sallie Carlisle, and a cousin, Crystal Carlisle. Darlwin
will live with her great-grandmother in Gary, Ind., where she was
found three months ago.
   ``She's in very good spirits,'' said Roberta O'Shea, her
physical therapist. ``She's very excited to be going home. She
won't need physical therapy anymore. As you can see, she walked out
fine.''
   ``She's been doing wonderfully,'' said Dr. Paula Jaudes,
Darlwin's physician at La Rabida. ``She can ride a bicycle, she can
roller skate. We took her to a ballgame over the weekend.''
   Darlwin's father, James Carlisle of Fort Wayne, Ind., said he
had hoped to regain custody of his daughter but decided he had
little chance of convincing the courts because he and his wife,
Alice, already have two small children.
   Darlwin lived with her mother, Darlwin Britt, in Gary, before
being found Jan. 17 by a construction worker in the family's
unheated home in a padlocked apartment building. Authorities said
the girl apparently had been locked inside the freezing attic
several days earlier by her mother, who allegedly abandoned the
girl.
   Britt, 25, has pleaded innocent to charges of felony child
neglect.
   Doctors at the University of Chicago's Wyler Children's Hospital
determined they could not save Darlwin's lower legs from
frostbite-caused gangrene, and amputated them 6 inches below the
knees Jan. 23.
   The girl was transferred to La Rabida, also a University of
Chicago hospital, on Jan. 29 to be fitted with artificial limbs and
be trained how to use them.
   La Rabida staff members say they will miss Darlwin _ even though
she had an urge once in a while to roller skate in the halls.

   ``She has her permanent legs now and puts them on and off by
herself,'' Jaudes said. ``She also puts on and takes off her own
socks. She'll have a counselor in Indiana, but the physical
problems are gone.''
   The physician said Darlwin will be attending a regular
elementary school in Indiana, not a special school for the
handicapped.
   ``You can't consider her handicapped,'' said Jaudes.

<TEXT>
   Before she was abandoned, Darlwin had been a third-grader at
Gary's Daniel Webster School, where a fund has been set up for her.
   Because of the intense public interest and support Darlwin
received after she was found, La Rabida authorities said they
planned to bar reporters from interviewing her or her family.
   While she was being treated at Wyler, Darlwin received a bag of
mail a day on average from well-wishers, hospital officials said.
More importantly, the public contributed more than $120,000 to pay
for Darlwin's medical treatment and future welfare.
   The bill at Wyler alone was $27,020. The bill at La Rabida was
$18,000 in early March, and was then growing at the rate of about
$600 a day. A current figure was not available.

<HEAD>Tunisian Envoy Says Evidence Points to Israel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tunisian Ambassador Habib Ben Yahia said today
his country has evidence that Israel carried out last weekend's
assassination of a Palestinian leader in Tunisia.
   Ben Yahia said the most conclusive piece of evidence was the
presence of a Boeing 707 aircraft with Israeli markings off the
Tunisian coast at the time of the assassination.
   The plane, carrying sophisticated electronic equipment, was used
to jam telecommunications around the town where Khalil al-Wazir
lived, he said. The plane's registration number was 4X977, he said.
Israel's international aircraft designation code is ``4X.''
   Ben Yahia said the government-appointed inquiry panel had found
that the commandos used 9mm Israeli-made Uzi submachine guns to
kill al-Wazir, one of the top leaders of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, two bodyguards and a Tunisian gardner. Reports from
Tunisia said the attack was carried out by seven people.
   He said the team used false Lebanese passports to enter Tunisia,
driving two Volkswagen minibuses and a Peugeot car rented from a
Tunis car rental agency to reach al-Wazir's home. The cars were
later found abandoned on a beach 10 miles from the scene of the
attack, he said.
   The inquiry panel is still investigating whether the commandos
got away by boat, he said.
   In all, Ben Yahia said, the preliminary investigation had
determined the ``unequivocable responsibility of the Israeli
government'' for Saturday's assassination of al-Wazir by a commando
team.
   Unconfirmed reports from Israel say the operation was carried
out by navy frogmen, commandos and the Mossad intelligence agency.
Israel has refused to confirm or deny allegations of its
involvement.

<TEXT>
   Five times the warning
blared from the bridge on the USS Jack Williams: ``Silkworm
incoming.'' Five times the Iranian missiles missed their target, a
three ship attack group from the U.S. Navy.
   The U.S.-Iranian feud exploded into missile warfare Monday as
the United States attacked two Iranian platforms in retaliation for
a mine that blew a hole in a U.S. frigate last week in the Persian
Gulf.
   During the day, the ``surface action group'' led by the
Williams, a guided-missile frigate, came under attack five times
from Iran's Silkworm anti-ship missile batteries.
   Although Navy officers on the Williams identified the missiles
as Silkworms, the Pentagon and Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, did not confirm they were the Chinese-made
rockets. The Pentagon said today it was still analyzing the attack.
   ``Silkworm incoming,'' blared the bridge, lurching the Jack
Williams into violent maneuvers.
   Crewmen scrambled to spot the oncoming missiles.
   ``Everybody look astern! Everybody look astern!'' Lt. Augustino
Ponturier, the officer of the deck, shouted to junior officers and
lookouts.
   The gas turbine-drive frigate rolled sharply and pointed its
stern toward the approaching missile, presenting its smallest
target and allowing the aluminum-chaff launchers and other
defensive weapons a clear shot.
   None of the first four Silkworms came close enough to be seen
but members of a helicopter crew and a fire detail hit the deck as
the fifth crossed behind the ship and slammed into a distant oil
rig with an orange-yellow flash.
   Officers aboard the ship were elated with the response system.
   ``Not one of these ladies has a scratch on her, and the other
guys can't say that,'' said Capt. Don Dyer, operational commander
of the force.
   In all, six Iranian ships were damaged by U.S. fire Monday.
   Dyer said a C-130 aircraft that was spotting targets for the
Silkworm batteries was tracked by U.S. jets off the nuclear-powered
aircraft carrier Enterprise and was almost shot down.
   U.S. officials reported one U.S. helicopter with two crew
members aboard missing Monday, and the search for it continued
today. They denied Iranian claims that the vessel was shot down.
   The Williams, with members of a Pentagon news media pool aboard,
was the operational flagship for one of the three ``surface action
groups'' taking part in the fighting Monday in the southern gulf.
   The others in the group were the destroyers Joseph Strauss and
O'Brien.
   Monday's operations began when U.S. warships destroyed two
Iranian-owned oil platforms.
   Over the next few hours, U.S. Navy forces sank two missile-armed
patrol boats, damaged two others and bombed and rocketed two
frigates.
   One of the Iranian frigates, the Sahand, was hit by a Harpoon
missile fired from the Strauss.
   The white missile roared skyward in a cloud of smoke and
streaked for the horizon, as the men on the Williams' bridge
cheered wildly, ``Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!''
   A flash and white smoke erupted on the horizon, followed by a
long series of heavy explosions as the weapons and ammunition
aboard the Sahand blew up.
   Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke, a spokesman for the Navy's Joint Task
Force Middle East, said a U.S. pilot who observed the Sahand
reported it ``listing badly, with a big hole in its port side, the
superstructure on fire and a lifeboat with some survivors in the
water.''
   Shortly after, F-14 jet fighters from the Enterprise attacked
the Sahand's sister frigate, the Sabalan, after it fired a missile
at the aircraft.
   U.S. Army Maj. Barry Willey, a Central Command officer
accompanying the media pool, said the view from the bridge atop the
Williams was ``both spectacular and frightening _ contrails from
missiles could be seen in almost every direction.''
   The oil platform attacks were aimed at what U.S. officials
called military targets. Both the Sassan and Sirri platforms have
been used by the Iranians for military purposes, they say.
   The strikes were ordered after the frigate Samuel B. Roberts hit
a mine, which U.S. officials say was laid by Iran, in the central
gulf last Thursday. Ten crewman were injured.
   While other task groups were attacking the platforms, the
Williams' unit was sailing halfway through the Strait or Hormuz, in
calm seas, under clear skies within range of the Iranian Silkworm
batteries.
   Van Dyke said the misssion of the three ships was to ``exercise
the right of innocent transit passage and respond to all
contingencies.''
   And that's when the missile attacks came, apparently the first
time Iran had fired the Chinese-made rockets at ships in the Strait
of Hormuz and the southern gulf.
   Later Monday, as the Williams and its accompanying warships
sailed out of the ``Silkworm envelope'' into safer waters and a
setting sun, the alert level was lowered from ``general quarters''
to the next lowest, ``condition one-alpha.''
   Ponturier, of Red Bank, N.J., took off his steel helmet and
walked toward the door. ``It's Miller time,'' he said.

   President Reagan said today ``it seems to be
quieting down'' in the Persian Gulf after a round of sea and air
battles Monday in which the United States dealt a heavy blow to
Iranian forces.
   ``We hope it continues that way,'' Reagan told reporters during
a photo-taking session at the start of a meeting with Republican
members of Congress.
   Iran took a licking when it tried to strike back after the
United States destroyed two Iranian oil platforms. In the most
intense exchanges since Reagan beefed up U.S. firepower in the gulf
last summer, American forces sank or damaged four Iranian attack
boats and disabled two frigates that fired missiles at U.S. planes.
   Asked if the United States had underestimated what the Iranian
response would be, Reagan replied: ``No.''
   ``It seems to be quieting down. We hope it continues that way,''
Reagan said.
   Reagan said nine ships were involved in a search-and-rescue
mission for a U.S. Marine helicopter missing with two crewmen from
Monday's operation. The attack helicopter, on a reconnaissance
mission, had been due to land on the USS Wainwright by
mid-afternoon Monday, Washington time.
   Besides the ships, which searched through the night, the Navy
sent several aircraft aloft today as part of the search for the
helicopter. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said that
Iranian warships had brought down a U.S. helicopter.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that Adm. William
Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had briefed Reagan
and the Republican congressional leadership on the situation in the
gulf. Essentially, Fitzwater quoted Crowe as saying, Iranian naval
ships were in port today.
   Meanwhile, leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee said
that while they support Reagan's action, the United States should
reassess its go-it-alone policy of protecting the vital sea lanes.
   ``This is an action that was taken that was justified, and, I
think, measured,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the committee's
chairman. ``But I think we've got to make sure that we don't
convert this into a U.S.-Iranian war.''
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the committee's ranking
Republican, said ``we'd like to see a more coordinated
participation by our allies'' in the gulf. ``Our allies are there,
but thus far they have declined efforts by our nation to suggest
that we work at a more coordinated fashion.''
   Nunn and Warner were interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress united Monday behind
Reagan's warning that Iran will ``pay a price'' if it persists in
trying to trade blows with a militarily superior force of American
warships and aircraft in the Persian Gulf.
   Nunn said today that ``we need to re-examine our policy of
protecting only 11 (Kuwaiti) ships. Many people don't realize it,
but if a British ship or a French ship is attacked by an Iraqi
aircraft right in the sight of our own American ship, we don't do
anything. That has given the perception that we have lined up with
the Iraqis.''
   ``We've got to correct that perception and we've got to
re-examine our policy,'' Nunn said. But the senator also said that
``we need to get our allies ... to protect certain zones.''
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., appearing on ABC's
``Good Morning America,'' said ``I think we don't want to
unilaterally be there, the policemen over there.''
   Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., a member of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said on the same program that ``we're not really
protecting international shipping. What we're protecting is ships
flying the American flag. Many of the criticisms that we had when
this policy began is that we began it unilaterally without getting
international cooperation.''
   ``As time has gone on, the British, the French and the Italians
have come to assume roles,'' he said. ``But, indeed, if there was a
mistake in the policy originally, ... we did not act together and
get cooperation when this began.''
   The initial platform attack had been in retaliation for the mine
explosion last week that damaged the USS Samuel B. Roberts and
injured 10 crewmen. Fitzwater said there is ``conclusive evidence''
that Iran planted the mine that exploded Friday.
   ``They must know that we will protect our ships, and if they
threaten us, they'll pay a price,'' the president said in a speech
to a business audience.
   On Capitol Hill, Reagan won applause for consulting with
Congress before sending the military into action.
   ``The mines have been clearly identified as manufactured by the
Iranians and sown in the waters by the Iranians,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. ``The Iraniare carrying out
terrorist acts.''
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said Iran's decision to fight
back amounted to ``foolhardy behavior.''
   ``I'm not sure that it's explainable in terms of Western logic
at this point,'' Carlucci said at a Pentagon news conference. ``I
have to only assume that it's some kind of a fanatical reaction or
slavish obedience to a contingency plan.
   ``It certainly makes no sense whatsoever in military terms. And
we hope that tomorrow that will bring peace in the region.''
   From the White House to the Pentagon to the State Department,
the message to Iran was the same: cool it, or else.
   Reagan said the U.S. attacks on the oil platforms, which are
used as staging areas for Iranian gunboats, were a ``measured
response'' to the mining of the gulf.
   While saying the United States wants a more normal relationship
with Iran, Reagan said: ``We've taken this action to make certain
the Iranians have no illusions about the cost of irresponsible
behavior. We aim to deter further Iranian aggression, not provoke.''
   The incident was the second such outbreak of violence since the
United States began escorting oil tankers through the gulf last
July to protect them from attack from the warring parties in the
7{-year Iran-Iraq war.
   On Oct. 19, a raid was staged in retaliation to a missile attack
on a Kuwaiti ship flying the U.S. flag in which 18 Americans were
injured. Two Iranian oil platforms were destroyed in what Reagan at
the time termed a ``prudent'' response.

   Vice President George Bush said today he
eagerly awaits the fall presidential campaign against the Democrats
``even if they unleash Mario Cuomo.''
   Bush also defended anew the U.S. military strikes in the Persian
Gulf, saying they were designed to teach ``madmen'' like the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini a lesson.
   ``From having read the intelligence reports this morning,
response around the world and in the countries in the area _ some
whom won't publicly state it _ has been very strong and very
understanding,'' Bush told an audience here.
   ``We have a disproportionate responsibility to keep the sea
lanes open and for the stability of the moderate states in the
area,'' Bush said.
   He also told the GOP breakfast that he was eager and ready to
take on the Democrats in the fall. Pennsylvania's primary will be
held next Tuesday.
   ``I can't wait for the debates with the Democratic nominee no
matter who he turns out to be,'' the virtually certain GOP nominee
said. ``Even if they unleash Mario Cuomo I can't wait.''
   The New York governor has cast a long shadow over the Democratic
race, even though he has declined to run for the nomination.
   Bush has been citing the U a difficult language. It forces
me to attempt linguistic acrobatics with my mouth that I'm not used
too; I'm constantly in danger of getting stuck.''
   For the interview, Ustinov made his remarks in nearly fluent but
cautiously enunciated German.
   The play opened in West Berlin in January and has been sold out
ever since. More than 40,000 people are expected to see the
production before its scheduled April 30 closing, Gisela Huwe, a
theater spokeswoman, said.
   ```Beethoven's Tenth' is one of the greatest successes in the
40-year history of the Schiller,'' Huwe said of the two-act play
written by Ustinov.
   Much of the play's action concentrates on efforts by a fictional
London music critic named Stephen Winter to imagine how Beethoven's
10th Symphony might have sounded. It also focuses on his often
stormy relations with his son, Pascal, who composes modern
symphonies which Winter has no use for.
   A Viennese au-pair girl named Irmgard, who loves Beethoven and
Pascal, manages to wake the composer from the dead. The composer
rings the doorbell and strides, with long hair flowing, across the
stage.
   With the help of a hearing aid provided by the family doctor,
the old deaf master is able to hear his symphonies for the first
time.
   Ludwig van Beethoven's last completed symphony is his ninth _
The Choral. Music researchers, however, say they have discovered
sketches for an unfinished symphony, possibly a 10th, dated after
completion of his Ninth Symphony and before his death in 1827.
   In Ustinov's play, the audience never learns how the 10th
Symphony really sounded, but the resurrected genius helps bring the
feuding Winter family closer together.
   Critics say Ustinov's often deliberate German delivery adds to
the performance, increasing audience empathy to the character of
Beethoven, who makes a grumpy visit to the 20th century in a
rumpled coat and wig after 160 years in the grave.
   Ustinov said he especially enjoys playing on the West Berlin
stage.
   ``The actor is in direct contact with the audience here,'' he
said. ``The people are very warmhearted.''
   Ustinov is internationally known for his versatility as a stage
and screen actor, and in recent years has become best known for his
portrayal of Agatha Christie's Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot.
   He has written several other plays, a collection of short
stories and a novel.
   In film, he gained prominence for his portrayal of Nero in
Mervyn Le Roy's 1951 Hollywood epic, ``Quo Vadis.'' He is also
known as the voice of Babar the Elephant, a popular children's book
character created by the late French author Jean De Brunhoff.

ahead with a performance despite complaints by Filipino musicians
and a court order.
   The Philippine Federation of Musicians Inc. asked a court to
block the concerts, arguing they violated the Filipino musicians'
code of ethics and were an insult to local performers who were
excluded.
   The court issued an order banning Monday's performance, but
Iglesias went ahead with his third of four scheduled performances.
About 1,000 people paid the equivalent of $150 apiece for the
dinner show.
   Iglesias, who was once married to Filipino socialite Isabel
Preysler, arrived Thursday with his own 40-member band.
   ``I fly all over the world with my band,'' he said. ``You could
say it is my wife. Would you change your wife for a new one? No
way.''

her first meaningful television role.
   ``I don't think I ever met an Italian who went to see her
parents without food,'' Ms. Beasely, who now plays Agnes Dipesto on
``Moonlighting,'' says in the April 23 issue of TV Guide. ``So I
baked chocolate chip cookies and arranged them on a paper plate and

   Anthony Perkins, the evil anti-hero of the
Hitchcock thriller ``Psycho,'' will play two roles, actually
different sides of the same person, in his next film, officials
said Tuesday.
   Perkins will play both star characters in a film of Robert Louis
Stevenson's 1886 tale ``The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde,'' the story of a doctor who led a second life in the form of
villain Edward Hyde.
   Perkins, 52, said he will try to play the characters without
special makeup because that ``would have given him too much of a
monstrous effect.''
   ``Dr. Jekyll had problems and turned into Mr. Hyde after
experimenting with drugs,'' said the actor, adding that he did not
dabble in drugs himself.
   Perkins' co-star will be Glynis Barber, star of a popular
British television detective series, ``Dempsey and Makepeace.''
Officals said they will begin shooting at an undecided date on
location in London and Budapest, Hungary.

   Brown University has rejected plans by
the cable television station MTV to cover its spring celebration
for fear of being portrayed as a party school, an official said
Tuesday.
   Student organizers turned down MTV's request to cover the
four-day series of concerts and parties after Robert Reichley, the
school's vice president for university relations, expressed strong
disapproval.
   Reichley said he was disturbed by last year's MTV coverage,
which featured spring parties at the University of Connecticut,
Syracuse University, Indiana University and San Diego State.
   ``It was very clear to us that they emphasized all of the party,
social and drinking side of the thing,'' Reichley said. ``I just
don't think we have any desire to fall on our own spear and expose
ourselves to that kind of thing.''
   Eric Broudy, director of the Brown news bureau, also watched the
tape.
   ``People were seeming out of control,'' Broudy said. ``What we
didn't want was to have Brown portrayed as a big party.''
   Doug Herzog, MTV's senior vice president of programs, disagreed
with Brown's interpretation of the tapes.
   ``When we go to any campus, we try to represent more than just
one aspect of a school,'' Herzog said Tuesday through a
spokeswoman. ``Although most schools welcome our presence, we
understand Brown's position.''
   The spokeswoman, Tina Exarhos, said this year's program would
feature San Diego State, Indiana, Tulane University and the
University of Missouri.
   Brown has been in an unflattering spotlight several times in the
last few years, including the highly publicized December trial in
which an insurance executive was acquitted of charges that he
organized a prostitution ring involving Brown students.
   Keith Wexelblatt, co-chairman of the Spring Weekend planning
committee, said he was disappointed but agreed with the
administrators' decision.

<TEXT>
   The BASF Corp. has agreed to pay a $1.3
million civil penalty for importing and distributing chemicals in
the United States without properly notifying federal officials, the
Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday.
   EPA said the company had violated federal rules by importing
seven new chemicals without seeking agency review and beginnig
commercial distribution of four other chemicals without notifying
the EPA. Names and uses of the chemicals were not disclosed.
   In addition to the monetary payment, BASF agreed to begin
comprehensive training programs for its employees in this country
and at the parent headquarters in West Germany, and to begin an
audit of its 151 facilities to make sure they comply with federal
regulations.
   BASF voluntarily disclosed the violations in this case, EPA said.
   The fine, however, was the largest ever imposed in an
importation and distribution case, reflecting BASF's history of
past violations, EPA said. This was the ninth complaint by EPA
involving the Parsippany, N.J.-based company, whose products
include film, recording tapes and chemicals.
   When the complaint was first disclosed last December, EPA had
proposed to fine BASF $4.3 million.

   Arab hijackers of a Kuwaiti jet today
brought a 20-year-old woman related to the emir of Kuwait to a
microphone and she pleaded Kuwait to meet the hijackers' demands as
the ordeal entered its third week.
   ``If not, we are all in danger,'' said Anware Al-Sabah.
   Anware and her 22-year-old sister, Ibtesam, are the only two
women left among the approximately 35 hostages, all thought to be
Kuwaitis.
   It was the first time either of them has been made to plead for
the hijackers' cause.
   In a tense but firm voice, Anware said, ``We want you to tell
our families that my sister and I and all the passengers are well,
although our morale is low.''
   ``I hope from my family and government that they will hurry to
free the prisoners. If not, we are all in danger. Thank you.''
   It was the fifth time since the plane landed in Algiers early
Wednesday that the hijackers have broadcast appeals from hostages
for the Kuwait government to release 17 men convicted on terrorist
charges in Kuwait.
   The pro-Iranian prisoners were responsible for the 1983 attacks
on the U.S. and French embassies in the Persian Gulf sheikdom.
   Another of the emir's cousin, Fadel Khaled Al-Sabah, believed
suffering from a nervous disorder, broadcast an almost incoherent
but similar message Sunday.
   Kuwait has refused to meet the demand. There has been no
apparent break in the stalemate although Algerian mediators
continued their active shuttle between the plane and a high-level
Kuwaiti delegation.
   This morning contact with the Moslem Shiite hijackers began with
a request radioed to the control tower. ``Good morning,'' said one
of the hijackers, speaking clearly in English. ``We'd like to have
water for the plane, someone to clean the toilets and newspapers:
five in Arabic and three in French. We also need one medicine,
interviaform,'' a treatement for diarrhea.
   A yellow car carried an airport worker to the plane to fill the
request.
   As the Moslem holy month of Ramadan began on Monday, the
hijackers requested copies of the Koran, the Moslem holy book,
which were delivered.
   During Ramadan, observant Moslems do not eat or drink during
daylight hours. At the hijackers' request, a traditional pre-fast
meal was delivered to the plane Sunday night for all aboard.
   The Kuwait Airways flight from Thailand to Kuwait was hijacked
April 5 with 112 people aboard and forced to land in Mashhad, Iran,
where 57 eventually were released. On April 8, the jet flew to
Larnaca, Cyprus, where two passengers were killed and 13 freed.
Since landing in Algiers one passenger has been freed. The five to
eight hijackers are armed with grenades and guns and have
threatened to blow up the plane.
   A hostage freed on Thursday, 70-year-old Djumaa Abdallah Chatti,
flew out of Algeria on Monday night on a Kuwaiti executive jet.
Escorted to the plane by four members of the Kuwaiti negotiating
delegation, Chatti waved to television cameras before getting on
the plane but said nothing.
   The hijackers' only direct threat in Algeria was that made
Saturday when they asked that the plane be refueled so they could
``settle our score'' with Kuwait in another country, rather than in
``friendly Algeria.''
   Radio conversations on Monday made no reference to refueling the
plane or leaving Algeria. Radio Algiers said in an Arabic language
news broadcast on Monday that there was ``hope that a peaceful
solution is still possible'' despite no indication that either side
would make any concessions.
   The oficial radio reported ``new movement that gives a chance
for new elements,'' but did not elaborate.
   Algerian officials have been acting as mediators between a
Kuwaiti delegation and the gunmen, boarding the plane several times
a day for talks.
   Interior Minister Hedi Khediri, in charge of the mediation
effort, said early on he had obtained a promise from the hijackers
that they would not resort to violence on Algerian soil.

   A man believed to be a member of the leftist
terrorist group Direct Action was charged Tuesday in the 1986
bombing of the international police agency Interpol.
   Georges Cipriana was charged by investigating magistrate
Jean-Louis Brugiere with complicity in attempted homicide and
destruction of property with explosives, according to court sources
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Two powerful explosions on May 16, 1986, injured a police guard
and extensively damaged Interpol headquarters, located in the Paris
suburb of St. Cloud.
   At least two men were in a nearby car while two other men
planted the bombs, police said. A fifth man may have driven a
getaway car, police said.
   On Monday, Jean-Marc Rouillan, who police say was one of the
founders of Direct Action, was charged in the bombing.
   In 1985, Direct Action claimed 16 bomb attacks in the Paris
area. In 1986, about a dozen bombings were claimed by the terrorist
group, which has since been virtually dismantled and its leaders
arrested and tried.
   Interpol is the central information agency for the police in 138
member countries.

   All 3,000 students who stayed away from
classes for a ``skip day'' that ended in gang violence face
punishment from school authorities.
   The party in a park ended Friday when gang members opened fire
and wounded five in a crowd of 300 high school students who had
taken the day off.
   Superintendent Robert Fortenberry said Monday that those who
skipped without a valid excuse will receive a ``zero'' for that
day's grades and assignments.
   The punishment will be more severe for students taking part in
the shootings and those who already have chalked up a high number
of absences, Deputy Superintendent Dan Merritt said.
   Many parents are calling Fortenberry's office complaining that
he's being too hard on the students about the traditional ``skip
day.''
   Six people have been arrested and charged so far in the
shootings. Disciplinary hearings will be held for students and gang
members who carried guns at the park or broke other laws,
Fortenberry said.
   ``If they had weapons, I'll recommend to the Jackson School
Board that they be expelled,'' Fortenberry said.

<HEAD>Jews Protest Peacefully for Right to Emigrate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 35 Soviet Jews seeking to draw attention to
their demand to emigrate prior to the visit of U.S. Secretary of
State George P. Shultz demonstrated peacefully Tuesday at the
Moscow visa office.
   Scores of Soviets stopped to watch the demonstrators display
banners saying ``End Lawlessness,'' ``Let Us Go to Our Children and
Grandchildren,'' and other slogans.
   About a dozen uniformed police were on hand, and after about
five minutes one of them approached the protesters and asked them
to take down their signs. They complied, and there were no arrests.
   One of the protesters, Yuli Kosharovsky, said the protesters
support the meetings between top U.S. and Soviet officials leading
up to the May 29-June 2 summit meeting.
   ``We want the dialogue between the Soviet Union and America to
continue, and continue productively,'' Kosharovsky said. ``But we
want to stress that our destiny here is terrible.''
   Kosharovsky said he has been refused permission to emigrate to
Israel for 17 years because of ``unlawful decisions by anonymous
bureaucrats.'' He said officials have said he had access to state
secrets while working in a factory in the Ural Mountain city of
Sverdlov.
   Shultz is to arrive in Moscow on Thursday for the latest in a
series of monthly contacts leading up to the summit meeting. Both
sides are trying to work out an agreement to cut long-range nuclear
missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   But Shultz also has brought up human rights issues in the
meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze,
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top officials.
   Shultz plans to meet with refuseniks at the home of a U.S.
diplomat during his visit to Moscow this week.
   Another refusenik in the crowd, Tanya Zeman, said those who have
not received permission to leave the Soviet Union are getting
desperate.
   More than 8,000 Jews were allowed to emigrate in 1987, including
such well-known figures as Josef Begun, Vladimir Slepak, and Ida
Nudel. The 1987 total was higher than recent years but still far
below the 1979 total of more than 51,000.
   The Geneva-based intergovernmental Agency for Migration said 944
Jews were allowed to emigrate in March, the highest monthly total
since July 1981.

   A tornado blasted through this North
Florida town before dawn today, destroying several homes and a
college library, blowing off rooftops, flipping cars and leaving
four people dead and 15 injured, officials said.
   The tornado touched down at 4:30 a.m. just west of Madison,
about 50 miles east of Tallahassee, and cut a 12-mile swath of
destruction, authorities said.
   ``There was this huge roar and then I heard a tree crack out
there and thought we were all gone,'' said Marie Prince, a Madison
County sheriff's dispatcher. The tornado passed only four blocks
from her office.
   Four people were killed north of town, said Sheriff Joe Peavy.
Fifteen people were injured, but none of the injuries was critical,
according to Madison County Memorial Hospital administrator Jeannie
Baker.
   A house-to-house search found no more bodies, but a man and a
baby had to be freed from separate homes where they were trapped,
Peavy said.
   Two of the deaths occurred in mobile homes blown apart by the
tornado, and four other houses were seriously damaged as well, said
Madison County Civil Defense Director Bernard Wilson.
   ``It didn't leave any of it. Not even a dish. You'd never know
there was a trailer here,'' said Dorothy Butler, sister of one of
the victims.
   Rescue units from adjoining counties were helping out, along
with state law enforcement and forestry officials. State prisoners
were also on their way to help with the cleanup, Peavy said. He had
no estimate of the damage.
   The tornado was part of a storm system that struck across the
Southeast with high winds, lightning and hail. Trees, roofs and
mobile homes were damaged, and at least six other injuries were
reported.
   Madison, a town of about 3,500 people, is the county seat of
Madison County, a thinly populated tobacco growing area of piney
woods, rolling hills and swamps on the border with Georgia.
   The twister's destructive path started in front of a shopping
center and then proceeded straight into North Florida Junior
College, where it ``totaled the new library and took the roof off
the auditorium,'' Peavy said.
   The twister blew away several homes, blew the roof off a nearby
church, overturned cars and knocked down trees, Peavy said.
   As far as his office knew, all the damage was from one tornado,
Peavy said. He said the tornado's sweep through town lasted under
30 minutes.
   Electric company workers were restoring power throughout the
area.
   Two tornadoes struck near the towns of Malone and Bascom, about
100 miles to the west of Madison, said Jackson County emergency
management director John Mader.
   Three homes and a trailer were destroyed and five homes
seriously damaged, he said, and two people were slightly injured.
Many county roads were blocked by fallen trees, he said, and
officials were surveying the area by helicopter.
   The tornadoes were spawned by a belt of thunderstorms being
pushed by a cold front. Hail the size of golf balls and damaging
winds hit Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia.
   More than one inch of rain fell in one hour this morning in
Waycross, Ga., 70 miles northeast of here, and wind gusts of 40 mph
were reported in Valdosta, according to the National Weather
Service.
   Elsewhere in Georgia, trees and power lines were reported blown
down, a barn was reported destroyed and a tin roof was blown off an
old building.
   The winds destroyed up to nine mobile homes west of Bainbridge,
Ga., Monday night, injuring three people, one seriously. The
sheriff's office said the wind left the homes in shreds. Bainbridge
is 25 miles northwest of Tallahassee.
   A 9-year-old girl from Cottonwood, Ala., was injured by
lightning as she stood near a stove at her home Monday night. The
lightning accompanied a tornado that moved through southern Houston
County about 60 miles northwest of Tallahasse.
   In the eastern Georgia's Bulloch County, six mobile homes and
one house were heavily damaged shortly after dawn today, but no
injuries were reported, the weather service said.
   Tornado watches were still in effect across 14 southeastern
Georgia and 15 northeastern Florida counties until at least five
hours after the tornado hit.
   Madison County has been hit by seven tornadoes since 1959 with
only one injury reported, according to the National Weather Service.

   A giant U.S. Air Force C-5B aircraft has
delivered 45 tons of detection gear to the Soviet Union's nuclear
test site in an unprecendented flight, the Energy Department said.
   The gear is designed to help the United States determine the
size of a future Soviet nuclear test, scheduled to take place
sometime this summer.
   The gear left Indian Springs Air Force Base northwest of Las
Vegas Friday afternoon aboard the giant aircraft and arrived at an
airfield on the Soviet site Sunday evening, U.S. time, DOE
spokesman Chris West said Monday.
   A dozen test site scientists and workers were also on board and
joined 10 other U.S. personnel who had gone to the Soviet site at
Semipalatinsk earlier this month.
   Seven Soviet scientists are currently at the Nevada Test Site,
preparing to monitor an American blast sometime this summer.
   ``They've been to ground zero a couple of times and are planning
where they'll put their equipment,'' West said.
   The exchange is designed to test monitoring equipment the two
sides would use in making sure each country is adhering to nuclear
test treaties. The testing of monitoring equipment is a prelude to
a possible nuclear test ban.
   The seven Soviet scientists are staying at a dormitory at
Mercury, Nev., a government town at the test site 65 miles
northwest of Las Vegas.
   The Soviets spent some time sightseeing Saturday, just as other
Soviet nuclear scientists did during a historic visit in January.
   They toured downtown's Glitter Gulch and the Las Vegas Strip,
posing in front of a display of $1 million in cash at Binion's
Horseshoe Hotel and Casino.
   Nick Aquilina, head of the DOE's Nevada Operations Office, told
workers in a letter last week that the Soviets would be on the site
for several weeks.
   He encouraged test site workers to ``try to be good hosts and
treat them like other visitors to the test site.''

<HEAD>Consumer Reports: Nursing Home Insurance Not a Good Buy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insurance to cover the costs of nursing home
care has been promoted increasingly in the last few years, but
probably isn't a good buy for most Americans, a national consumer
group said Tuesday.
   And anyone considering such coverage should study the policy
carefully, Consumers Union warned. Even insurance sales
representatives are confused about what coverage is being offered,
officials of the group said at a news conference.
   Consumers Union rates more than 50 long-term care policies in
the May edition of its magazine, Consumer Reports, and finds some
fault with every one of them.
   ``The private insurance system cannot spread its costs over a
large enough number of people to make coverage affordable to the
millions who need it,'' Consumers Union President Rhoda Karpatkin
said.
   Only the federal government can do that, she said, calling for
congressional action to provide long-term care protection.
   Gail Shearer of the consumers group said policies providing
long-term care are quite expensive and are not recommended for
people of moderate income. Prices can range as high as $100 a month
to $260 a month.
   And people under 60 shouldn't buy such policies unless there is
some guarantee that benefits will rise to keep pace with inflation,
Ms. Shearer added.
   Nonetheless, many policies are being offered and some people may
be tempted to buy them, she said.
   Problems to watch out for include:
   _Protection may not be available to people who need it most _
those with health problems already. Check policies for exclusions
that disallow coverage for pre-existing conditions.
   _Some policies were found to cover only certain types of care,
but not custodial care, potentially the longest and most costly
type.
   _More than half of all nursing home patients are admitted
without having been hospitalized first, but a majority of the
long-term care policies checked required prior hospitalization
before benefits could be provided.
   _Alzheimer's disease accounts for half of all nursing home
patients, yet a majority of the policies did not specifically state
that it was covered.
   A company flooded with claims could decide to use the vague
language of its policies to exclude Alzheimer's coverage, Consumers
Union warned.
   In addition, the group noted that some policies require a
confirmed diagnosis to provide coverage, and Alzheimer's cannot
always be confirmed except by autopsy.

   A cloud of chlorine gas engulfed a
rural south railroad work crew of 55 men, sending 13 to hospitals
for treatment, officials said today.
   Hospital officials said only two of the Norfolk Southern
Railroad workers needed to be admitted overnight after the Monday
afternoon accident, and they were released this morning from South
Alabama Medical Center at Mobile.
   The others were treated for chemical inhalation and released.
   Janice Whatley, a member of the Mount Vernon rescue squad, said
the crew was working on Norfolk Southern tracks just south of
Alabama Power Co.'s Barry Electric Generating Plant.
   The cloud leaked from a gas line at a nearby chemical plant,
Rick Harris, a railroad spokesman in Atlanta said today.
   Harris said the accident closed the tracks for six hours. He
said the crew had symptoms that included swollen eyes, nausea and
breathing problems.
   The leak occurred in a chlorine line at an ICI Americas Inc.
plant that manufactures agricultural chemicals, plant manager Steve
Ledoux said today. He said the leak was capped immediately and the
cause was being investigated.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III faces new
problems rebuilding a Justice Department rocked by resignations now
that his second choice for the No. 2 post has told him to find
somebody else.
   Meese is looking for a new nominee after former American Bar
Association President John Shepherd told the attorney general's
aides on Monday to begin searching for a new candidate, Justice
Department sources say.
   Meese, asked today whether Shepherd had withdrawn, said, ``Not
yet. I expect we will be hearing today or tomorrow.'' Meese
declined comment when asked whether he was thinking of other names
to suggest.
   The attorney general was questioned as he left a memorial
service for law enforcement officers slain while enforcing drug
laws.
   While department sources said Shepherd had not flatly withdrawn,
they said he already had informed the department that he probably
would do so. The sources, speaking only on condition of anonymity,
said Shepherd asked that Meese's aides begin looking for other
candidates.
   Meese's problems in filling the post of deputy attorney general,
as well as the position of assistant attorney general in charge of
the criminal division, stem from the abrupt resignations March 30
of Arnold Burns and criminal division chief William Weld.
   They quit out of concern that the nearly year-old criminal
investigation of Meese is hurting Justice Department operations,
morale and image.
   A number of current and former U.S. attorneys have been
approached about taking Weld's post, but all have turned it down,
department sources have said.
   Meese, who testified before a federal grand jury for four hours
in the probe Monday, has refused to resign, predicting that he
won't be indicted.
   In an attempt to recover quickly from the resignations, Meese
hurriedly announced the selection of Shepherd for the No. 2
position two weeks ago without customary White House clearance and
FBI background checks. President Reagan still has not nominated
Shepherd.
   Shepherd, 62, a St. Louis attorney, told Meese last Friday that
he was giving serious consideration to withdrawing because of
stress on his family stemming from his selection.
   A former bookkeeper from Shepherd's law firm testified shortly
before Meese recommended him for the post that she had an affair
with Shepherd. The bookkeeper, who was convicted of embezzlement,
claimed Shepherd had told her to write checks to herself. Shepherd
denied that he had an affair with her or that he had authorized her
to write checs.
   The trial testimony and Shepherd's membership in an all-white
country club and an all-male social club brought increasing public
scrutiny of Shepherd after Meese announced his selection April 5.
   Meese's first choice to fill the post of deputy attorney general
was former federal judge Arlin Adams, now a Philadelphia lawyer.
Adams said he was unable to take the post because he had a heavy
caseload and had gone to work at the law firm just last year. Adams
said Meese's legal problems were not a major factor in his decision
not to take the Justice Department position.
   Meanwhile, Meese has gone outside the department in his attempt
to fill Weld's old job at the head of the criminal division, other
Justice Department sources said.
   Stephen A. Saltzburg, a University of Virginia law professor,
has been sounded out about possibility of taking the job, said the
sources speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Reached at his home, Saltzburg said he hadn't been offered the
job, but would not comment when asked whether he had been
approached about it.
   Saltzburg also is a consultant on a legal question in the
Iran-Contra prosecutions being conducted by independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh.
   Saltzburg is a consultant to former federal judge and ex-U.S.
attorney Herb Stern. Stern was hired by Walsh to represent the
Iran-Contra prosecutor on the issue of congressional immunity.
   The legal question is whether or not the congressional testimony
compelled by grants of immunity to former National Security Council
staffer Oliver North, former national security adviser John
Poindexter and businessman Albert Hakim prejudice their Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination.

   The editor of a magazine critical of the
government denied in court Tuesday that he violated publication
regulations.
   Gitobu Imanyara, a lawyer and editor in chief of The Nairobi Law
Monthly, was charged under the country's Books and Newspapers Act.
   His magazine has published articles criticizing political
detentions without trial, including those of lawyers who since have
been released. The publication has also challenged alleged
government interference in the courts and a new procedure approved
by the Kenya African National Union, the sole legal political
party, using head counts to tally votes in preliminary elections.
   The editor was accused of failing to deliver magazine copies to
a government registrar and of not making annual returns stating how
many magazines were published and at what prices they sold.
   Imanyara was freed on bail pending trial at a date still to be
set.
   The editor of a recently banned church magazine will appear in
court on similar charges April 26.

   The body of slain PLO commander Khalil
al-Wazir was flown to Damascus today for burial in the Syrian
capital in the absence of his lifetime comrade, Yasser Arafat.
   The 52-year-old al-Wazir, better known as Abu Jihad, was
assassinated Saturday in a commando raid at his home outside the
Tunisian capital.
   Israeli sources have acknowledged that Israel was responsible
for al-Wazir's death but the government officials have not
confirmed this.
   The plane carrying Al-Wazir's body arrived in the Syrian capital
at 2:45 p.m. after a flight from Tunisia.
   Accompanying the body were al-Wazir's wife, Intisar, his five
children, and senior Palestine Liberation Organization officials,
including political department chief Farouk Kaddoumi, Executive
Committee member Mahmoud Abbas, and the guerrilla movement's
security chief, Hayel Abdel-Hamid.
   Arafat, the PLO chief, saw the body off at Tunis airport but
stayed behind, apparently because of his feud with President Hafez
Assad of Syria.
   Arafat and al-Wazir were expelled from Damascus in June 1983
after a Syrian-backed mutiny in PLO ranks.
   The PLO chief's media adviser, Bassam Abu Sharif, confirmed in a
telephone interview with The Associated Press that Arafat would not
attend al-Wazir's funeral Wednesday.
   Al-Wazir was born in Ramle, which is now in Israel, and had
asked to be buried close to Palestine. His mother and father live
in Damascus.
   Abu Sharif said another top PLO leader, Salah Khalaf, better
known as Abu Iyad, also would not attend the funeral. He, too, has
not visited Damascus since the PLO-Syrian feud.
   Al-Wazir, Khalaf and Arafat launched Fatah, the PLO's main
guerrilla group, in 1965. Fatah accounts for more than 80 percent
of the PLO's military strength.
   The PLO and the Tunisian government have blamed Israel for the
murder of al-Wazir, who reportedly masterminded Palestinian rioting
against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israeli sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have
privately acknowledged that the Mossad intelligence service and the
Israeli navy cooperated in the assassination.
   The Tunisian government filed a complaint today with the U.N.
Security Council. Tunisian investigators said Israel was behind the
attack, in which al-Wazir and two aides were killed.
   Tunisia's ambassador to the United Nations today requested an
urgent meeting of the Security Council to condemn the assassination.
   President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia condemned the
``flagrant, premeditated aggression against Tunisian sovereignty.''
   The U.S. government on Monday sharply criticized al-Wazir's
killing. ``Violence is not the solution to the problems of the
Middle East,'' said State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman.
   The Tunisian investigators' report said an Israeli military
Boeing 707 was 34 miles outside Tunisian air space at time of the
attack.
   The plane, ``of the type used in the electronic war,'' jammed
communications in Sidi Bou Said, the northern suburb where Wazir
lived outside Tunis, the report said.
   ``The terrorist group which assassinated the Palestinian leader
had sophisticated technological support which put this operation
beyond the framework of normal terrorists and into the kind of
terrorism that only states are in a position to practice,'' the
report said.

<HEAD>Pope Urges Religious Freedom for Ukrainian Catholics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Tuesday called for
religious freedom for Ukrainian Catholics in a letter marking the
1,000 anniversary of Christianity in what is now the Soviet Union.
   ``No one ought to consider membership in the Catholic Church as
incompatible with the good of the homeland and with the heritage of
Saint Vladmir,'' the pope said in a letter to Ukrainian Catholics
around the world.
   Prince Vladimir introduced Christianity in Kievan Rus', the
ancient name of the Soviet Ukraine, with a mass baptism on the
banks of the Dnieper River in 988.
   The Ukrainian church was suppressed in 1946 by Soviet dictator
Josef Stalin, who ordered it absorbed into the Russian Orthodox
church. Ukrainian priests who refused to accept the state-dominated
Orthodox church were shot or imprisoned, according to church
historians.
   Today, Eastern Rite Ukrainian Catholics make up the largest
underground church in the officially atheist Soviet Union.
Ukrainian clerics say there are up to 4 million Ukrainian Catholics
in the Soviet Union, including 10 secret bishops and more than 100
priests. Another 1.5 million Ukrainian Catholics live abroad.
   The pope, who has often expressed his desire to visit the Soviet
Union but has not been invited, said he would instead make a
``spiritual pilgrimage'' to the Ukraine for the millennium.
   The pope's letter was addressed to Cardinal Myroslav Ivan
Lubachivsky, the Rome-based leader of Ukrainian Catholics,
Ukrainian bishops and ``all the Ukrainian priests, religious and
faithful.''
   John Paul said the Ukrainian church ``has been tried by such
great adversity in recent decades.''
   ``May your great numbers of faithful enjoy true freedom of
conscience and respect for their religious right to give public
worship to God,'' the pontiff wrote.
   He said the main celebrations for the millennium would be held
in Rome. Vatican Radio has said the observance will include a Mass
celebrated by the pope and Ukrainian bishops in St. Peter's
Basilica on July 10.
   Last month, the Vatican announced the Russian Orthodox Church
had invited the pope to send a Vatican delegation to attend the
official millennium celebrations in the Soviet Union. It said the
pope would appoint the delegation for the trip to Moscow in June.
   The pope has said he would visit the Soviet Union only if he is
allowed to visit Catholics throughout the country, including the
Ukraine and Lithuania.

   Chrysler Corp. negotiators asked the United Auto
Workers today to support the automaker's efforts to organize plant
workers into teams and help avoid increased assembly costs.
   The team plan would allow Chrysler greater flexibility in using
different workers for different jobs, Vice President Anthony St.
John said after a second morning of meetings with the UAW on a new
contract.
   St. John said Chrysler, the nation's No. 3 automaker, wants
modifications to a pattern contract adopted last year at Ford Motor
Co. and General Motors Corp. to help avoid cost increases.
   Chrysler wants to set a minimum retirement age to keep more
workers active in their prime and increase the ratio of active
workers to retirees. St. John said Chrysler workers now retire as
early as age 48.
   Adopting a minimum retirement age, as well as encouraging
workers to join prepaid health care plans, would help keep
Chrysler's per-car production cost from going as much as $3.50
above GM's, St. John said.
   UAW spokesman Bob Barbee said the union had no immediate comment
on Chrysler's proposals.
   On Monday, St. John said Chrysler's senior executives will forgo
bonuses in years when the No. 3 automaker earns too little to share
profits with workers.
   The announcement came as the sides opened early talks on a
contract covering 66,000 workers in 15 states.
   Chrysler workers have no profit-sharing formula under the
current contract, which expires Sept. 14. But union and company
officials agree they will adopt an industry-pattern agreement
established last fall at GM and Ford Motor Co. that contains
profit-sharing.
   Union officials will study St. John's announcement before
commenting, UAW spokesman Peter Laarman said, calling it ``a free
gift, the kind you have to look at real close.''
   UAW leaders have blasted General Motors Corp., the nation's
largest automaker, for paying millions of dollars in cash bonuses
or stock awards to executives in the past two years while saying
its earnings were insufficient to distribute profits to workers.
   ``There is a public perception that it is unfair _ and we tend
to agree with that,'' St. John said.
   ``In any year where profit-sharing payments are not made to UAW
employees, the annual senior executive bonuses will also not be
paid. We intend to work through that issue in a commitment form
with the UAW,'' he said.
   St. John and UAW President Owen Bieber said they hope to reach a
contract settlement in two to three weeks. Union bargainers
presented their demands Monday.
   Company negotiators were scheduled to present proposals today
before the release of a company proxy statement likely to show that
Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca again exercised stock options granted
in the early 1980s, when Chrysler's stock was worth a fraction of
its present value.
   In 1986, Iacocca earned more than $20 million in salary,
benefits and exercised stock options.
   The pattern contract's profit-sharing formula resulted in a
record $636 million distributed among 156,000 Ford workers last
year. Ford profit-sharing checks averaged about $4,000 per worker.
   Bieber said pattern bargaining ``has always served our
membership very well. It has been a stabilizing force within the
companies and between them.''
   St. John also said Chrysler wants to set up a committee of union
and company officials and outside participants to track the new
contract's ability to protect jobs and increase efficiency and
quality at Chrysler plants.
   The committee's findings would be used in drawing up a new
contract in 1990, St. John said, apparently indicating Chrysler
will agree to the union's demand for a two-year contract.
   Bieber and UAW Vice President Marc Stepp said they want to put
Chrysler's contract expiration back in synch with the GM and Ford
pacts so that in 1990, all three will expire together for the first
time in a decade.
   The talks, which normally would begin in mid-July, cover wages,
benefits and working conditions.
   Chrysler's UAW contract covers 51,600 hourly, 5,600 salaried and
6,000 laid-off workers at factories, parts depots and offices in
Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Massachusetts, Colorado, Alabama,
Indiana, California, Tennessee, Minnesota, Delaware, New York,
Oregon, Florida and Missouri.

<HEAD>Dukakis Leads in Senate ``Super Delegate'' Balloting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis led the
balloting in the first round of the Capitol Hill ``primary'' today,
when Senate Democrats named 43 members as ``super delegates'' to
this summer's convention.
   The presidential candidates focused their attention on the New
York primary, where 255 delegates were at stake, but nearly as many
convention seats were to be decided by Senate and House Democrats
in sessions today and Wednesday.
   Dukakis won the backing of 13 of those selected, while most of
the professional politicians _ 21 _ remained uncommitted.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., whose campaign was dependent on a good
showing in today's New York primary, was second to Dukakis, gaining
the support of six of his Senate colleagues. He was named as a
delegate as well.
   Sen. Paul Simon, whose campaign is on hold, managed to win only
a seat for himself and the backing of fellow Illinois Sen. Alan
Dixon.
   Jesse Jackson, Dukakis' closest challenger, was shut out.
   The Senate's choices kept Dukakis' overall delegate lead intact.
   According to the AP count, Dukakis had 881 delegates to 745 for
Jackson. Gore had 419 and Simon 183. Uncommitted delegates totaled
622.
   Today's choices came in a quick public vote by the Senate
Democratic Conference, following weeks of secret jockeying for the
spots at the convention in Atlanta in July.
   Senate Democratic Leader Robert C. Byrd said that the selection
process was relatively painless.
   ``We were pleased that we were able to accommodate almost every
Democratic member who requested to be an unpledged delegate,'' the
West Virginia Democrat said.
   He did not name the two who lost out because of seniority.
   The House Democratic Caucus makes its official choices for 210
``super delegate'' slots on Wednesday, and Dukakis is ahead among
those already nominated for those positions as well.
   The results from the Senate caucus were not a surprise, although
32 of the 43 were nominated last week in secret. The other 11 were
nominated and put on the list over the weekend.
   The Associated Press obtained a list of those nominees.
   Among the first 32, Dukakis had nine, Gore five, Simon two and
16 were uncommitted.
   The 11 additional delegates named today added four delegate
votes for Dukakis, two for Gore and six to uncommitted.
   A total of 646 of the 4,162 votes to be cast at the Atlanta
convention will come from super delegates.
   In addition to the 253 congressional slots, 362 votes will be
cast by members of the Democratic National Committee and 26 by
Democratic governors. Five former party leaders also have automatic
seats at the convention.
   The 11 senators added to the delegate list today were: Quentin
Burdick of North Dakota, J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Jeff
Bingaman of New Mexico, Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, Brock
Adams of Washington, Tim Wirth of Colorado, Wyche Fowler of
Georgia, Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Harry Reid of Nevada.

<HEAD>Eastern Airlines, Texas Air Corp. Lash Out at Unions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The executives of Eastern Airlines and its
parent Texas Air Corp., lashed out at the unions today for a
``slanderous safety campaign'' and ``misinformation'' that they say
has led to the government investigation into the airline company.
   ``Eastern today is the most watched airline in the business,''
Texas Air chairman Frank Lorenzo told a news conference, adding
that he welcomed the government probes into Eastern and Continental
Airlines, also part of his airline empire.
   ``The ramp inspections (ordered by the Federal Aviation
Administration) will demonstrate once and for all that Continental
and Eastern are as safe as any major airline,'' said Lorenzo.
   ``What is at issue is how far a union is permitted to go by
weakening a company through harassament .. (and) misinformation ...
in part (in an attempt) to take over the company,'' said Lorenzo,
who vowed to keep Eastern.
   ``The company is not for sale,'' Lorenzo said, adding that while
he is aware of interests by some union leaders to launch a hostile
takeover he has no concerete evidence of such a move.
   Officials from the unions representing Eastern's mechanics and
pilots could not be reached immediately for comment on the charges.
They have said in the past that they are only trying to highlight
efforts by Lorenzo to weaken Eastern.
   The airline and the mechanics' union are negotiating a contract
in which the union has been resisting demands by management that it
take significant wage concessions.
   Philip Bakes, president of Eastern, said that he is confident
the federal investigation of Eastern will conclude the airline is
being operated safely. He said federal inspectors have examined all
of Eastern's jets at least once since the probe was announced last
week and some planes have been examined five or six times as they
operate in and out of different airports.
   Bakes accused the unions of a ``slanderous safety campaign''
which he said has been a ``major factor'' in recent financial
losses by the airline.
   While some Eastern jets have been taken out of service after the
inspections, he characterized such actions as routine and ``proof
that the system is working.''
   ``Everyday planes are being taken out of service'' briefly as
part of the airline's normal operations when they have mechanical
or other problems.
   Texas Air, the country's largest airline company, has been
reeling from a series of inspections announced last week by the FAA
and the Transportation Department into safety at the two airlines
and the parent holding company's management and finances.
   The news conference also was attended by two members of
Eastern's board of directors and by Frank Borman, who was Eastern's
chairman before the airline was sold to Texas Air in 1986 and now
remains on Texas Air's board of directors.
   All of the executives blamed the labor turmoil at Eastern for
creating ``an atmosphere'' which prompted the unusual scrutiny of
both the FAA and its parent Transportation Department.
   Bakes said Eastern is ``clearly being hurt by operating in an
atmosphere of many myths'' but that the various federal
investigations of Eastern and Texas Air so far have had only a
small impact on flight bookings at the airline.
   ``Obviously this isn't helping our business,'' he said.
   Eastern, meanwhile, said it was launching an advertising
campaign aimed at countering the attack on its image. The aim of
the ads as well as Tuesday's news conference is ``to clear the
air'' and ``set the record straight,'' said Clark Onstad, a Texas
Air vice president.

   A bomb blew up today at an office
building near Parliament, shattering the entrance and spraying
glass fragments into the street.
   The blast reportedly caused no injuries, but ambulances and fire
engines were called in and the area was cordoned off. Residents of
a nearby apartment complex were evacuated as a precaution.
   The explosion occurred at 6:18 p.m. at the Santam building,
about 100 yards from Parliament. Parliament was in session at the
time of the blast.
   Police had no immediate comment on the type of explosive
involved or who might have been responsible.
   There have been several bombings in South Africa in the past
week, including one that damaged Johannesburg's city hall and
another that killed a man and injured a woman outside a cinema
complex in Pretoria.
   Authorities have blamed the blasts on guerrillas of the outlawed
African National Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting to
overthrow the government and end apartheid.
   Police Commissioner Hennie De Witt said today that the man
killed by the blast Friday in Pretoria had been identified as a
``trained African National Congress terrorist.'' De Witt said the
man, whose name was not made public, was carrying a Soviet-made
limpet mine when it exploded accidentally.

   Nine-year-old Darlwin Carlisle, whose frostbitten
legs were amputated after she was abandoned in an unheated
apartment this winter, walked out of a hospital Tuesday on
artificial legs, smiling and waving.
   ``She's very motivated, very courageous,'' said Roberta O'Shea,
the girl's physical therapist at La Rabida Children's Hospital.
``She runs and she jumps and she can skip. She can do just about
everything.
   ``The only thing she can't do is double-Dutch jump rope because
I don't know how,'' and so she couldn't teach her.
   Darlwin's ordeal touched hearts nationwide after she was found
locked in a Gary, Ind., apartment Jan. 17 by a construction worker
who said he heard a child's voice plead, ``Please don't board me
up.''
   Hundreds of presents, thousands of letters and donations
totaling $125,000 poured in to cheer her up and pay her hospital
bills after her legs were amputated just below the knee.
   Before Darlwin left the hospital Tuesday, her relatives packed
up four boxes with toys and other presents she received.
   Under a sunny blue sky, Darlwin walked down the front steps of
La Rabida, holding two dolls and wearing a pink and white lace
dress with pink bows in her hair.
   She limped very slightly as she walked to a waiting car,
accompanied by her great-grandmother, Katie Carlisle, her aunt,
Sallie Carlisle, and a cousin, Crystal Carlisle. Darlwin will live
with her great-grandmother in Gary, Ind.
   One of Darlwin's nurses kissed her while Ms. O'Shea made sure
her seat belt was fastened.
   ``She's in very good spirits,'' Ms. O'Shea told reporters.
``She's very excited to be going home. She won't need physical
therapy anymore. As you can see, she walked out fine.''
   While at La Rabida, Darlwin learned to ride a bicycle _ falling
only once _ and how to roller skate without using canes, Ms. O'Shea
said.
   ``She's been doing wonderfully,'' said Paula Jaudes, Darlwin's
physician at La Rabida. ``You can't consider her handicapped.''
   Darlwin lived with her mother, Darlwin Britt, in Gary, before
being found by construction worker Jeff Griffin who had been sent
to board up an unheated brick home after a mortgage foreclosure.
   Griffin said at the time that he heard a child pleading for
help, removed a six-foot refrigerator from the top of the stairway
and kicked open a padlocked door to rescue the girl.
   Doctors said later the severity of her injuries indicated she
had been in the extreme cold for at least five days.
   Doctors at the University of Chicago's Wyler Children's Hospital
determined they could not save Darlwin's lower legs from gangrene,
and amputated them Jan. 23.
   Her 25-year-old mother has pleaded innocent to three counts of
felony child neglect and remains in the Lake County Jail in Crown
Point, Ind., in lieu of $50,000 bail, said Diane McDowell, a
spokeswoman for the county prosecutor's office. Her trial is
scheduled June 20. She faces up to 60 years in prison, if convicted
on all three counts, Ms. McDowell said.
   The girl was transferred to La Rabida, also a University of
Chicago hospital, on Jan. 29 to be fitted with artificial limbs.
   Her bill at Wyler reached $27,020 and at La Rabida it was
averaging about $500 a day, La Rabida's development director,
Phyllis Monjar, said, which would have brought it to about $39,500
through Monday. Donated money not used for medical bills will be
used to provide for Darlwin's future education and care.
   In Gary, Darlwin will return soon to a regular elementary
school, probably as a fourth-grader, Ms. Monjar said.

   A chlorine gas leak at a chemical
plant formed a toxic cloud that engulfed a railroad work crew of 55
people, sending 13 to hospitals, officials said Tuesday.
   Two of the Norfolk Southern Railroad workers were hospitalized
overnight and released Tuesday from South Alabama Medical Center at
Mobile, officials said. The others were treated Monday for chemical
inhalation.
   Janice Whatley, a member of the Mount Vernon rescue squad, said
the crew was working on Norfolk Southern tracks.
   The gas leaked from a line at ICI Americas Inc., said Rick
Harris, a railroad spokesman in Atlanta. The cause was not known.
The company makes agricultural chemicals.
   The tracks were closed for six hours.

   Unreasonable fear of AIDS could cause a
substantial disruption of the workplace unless employees are
educated about how to deal with co-workers who have the fatal
disease, according to the results of a survey released Tuesday by
the American Red Cross.
   The survey, conducted by David M. Herold of the Georgia
Institute of Technology, showed that of 2,000 employees questioned
across the country, 42 percent said they would not work with anyone
who has AIDS. Twenty-nine percent said they felt so strongly about
it that they would quit their jobs before working with an AIDS
patient.
   Herold said at a news conference at the American Red Cross
national headquarters that there already have been incidents in
which work came to a standstill as a result of unreasonable fear
toward the immune deficiency disease.
   He said a state government office in Florida was shut down
completely when a worker with AIDS became ill and vomited in his
office. Maintenance workers refused to clean up the mess and
co-workers refused to continue to work in the area. The office was
forced to close for the day, he said.
   A power company was forced to cancel a cardiopulminary
resuscitation training program when workers said that they would
not use the skill if they learned it because of their fear of AIDS,
he said. CPR requires mouth-to-mouth breathing.
   ``They (the workers) said that if anybody touched a live wire
and got electrocuted, they would just have to die because nobody
would do CPR,'' said Herold.
   He declined to identify the state government office or the
utility company.
   Herold said that companies need to make policies now dealing
with AIDS-infected employees because it often is too late to make
policies after the problem develops.
   ``The passions run high when AIDS if found in the workplace,''
said Herold.
   The American Red Cross announced that it has developed a program
to help head off such problems through an AIDS education course
offered to businesses for their employees.
   Called ``Working Beyond Fear,'' the course includes a video
presentation and an instructor who can answer questions and promote
discussion in meetings of employees, said Carole Kauffman, manager
of the AIDS program at the Red Cross national headquarters.
   Ms. Kauffman said that more than a quarter million people are
expected to be infected by the AIDS virus in the 1990s, suggesting
that AIDS in the workplace will become a growing issue.
   ``It is conceivable that every business in America will be
affected by AIDS,'' said Ms. Kauffman.
   She said the training course will be offered by the 3,000 Red
Cross chapters in the country at a cost of $100 to $170. She said
the course would be taught in the workplace and can be arranged by
employers who call the local chapters.
   The Public Relations Society of America is assisting the Red
Cross in promoting the program, and representatives of both the
AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce attended the news
conference Tuesday to announce their endorsement of the course.
   Vincent R. Sombrotto, who is president of the National
Association of Letter Carriers and an AFL-CIO official, said the
unions support the AIDS training program because ``ignorance of the
disease can be a greater problem than the disease itself.''
   AIDS is a contagious disease that destroys the immune system,
rendering the body incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections. It is caused by a virus that most often is spread
through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from
infected persons. The disease currently is incurable and fatal.
   Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug
users, although a small percentage of cases are attributed to
transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread
from infected pregnant women to their offspring.
   As of April 4, AIDS had been diagnosed in 58,270 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 32,545, have died since 1981, according to
the Centers for Disease Control.

<HEAD>Court Upholds States' Power to Control Gasoline Prices, Profits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the power
of states to control gasoline prices and oil industry profits in a
ruling that state officials say will help protect the public when
there are energy crises.
   The justices voted, 8-0, to reinstate regulations in Puerto Rico
that limit oil company profits and prevent an excise tax from being
passed on to consumers.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said the absence
of specific federal legislation on gasoline regulation leaves the
states free to adopt such rules.
   The ruling treats Puerto Rico, a commonwealth, as though it were
a state and applies to all states.
   Scalia rejected oil industry arguments that Congress, by
eliminating gasoline controls, mandated a free market in petroleum
products.
   There may be a ``general congressional desire'' favoring the
free market, he said.
   ``But unenacted approval, beliefs and desires are not laws,''
Scalia added. ``Without a text that can ... plausibly be
interpreted as prescribing federal pre-emption (of state power) it
is impossible to find that a free market was mandated by federal
law.''
   The ruling was hailed by Jeffrey C. Genzer, general counsel to
the National Association of State Energy Officials.
   ``The governors need the ability to respond quickly'' when there
are energy shortages, he said.
   ``I've heard it a million times. When they're standing in gas
lines or don't have enough home fuel, people come to the governor
or the state energy director,'' not to the federal government for
help, he added.
   Genzer said the ruling may not have great immediate impact
because there are no oil shortages now that require emergency state
action.
   But he said that without Tuesday's decision states could be
powerless, for example, to enforce so-called set-aside programs
requiring that a percentage of gasoline be reserved for
top-priority needs when there are shortages. Most states have laws
that give governors broad emergency powers to protect fuel supplies.
   The Supreme Court ruling overturns a 1986 decision by a federal
appeals court here that said Congress intended to bar state
regulation of the oil industry when it lifted controls on gasoline
effective in 1981.
   Congress authorized the federal government in 1970 to place
controls on petroleum products in an effort to curb inflation. That
law expired in 1973.
   Congress, in the wake of an Arab oil embargo, then enacted an
emergency law placing extensive price and allocation controls on
gasoline.
   That was followed in 1975 by a new law aimed at promoting oil
conservation. The 1975 law was amended later to provide for gradual
deregulation and give the president sweeping authority to lift
controls selectively.
   Complete deregulation by the federal government was required as
of Sept. 30, 1981.
   Puerto Rico, which previously had suspended its regulation of
petroleum products while the federal controls were in effect,
placed an excise tax on oil refiners in 1986.
   The Puerto Rico Department of Consumer Affairs then issued
regulations requiring advance notice of price increases,
prohibiting wholesalers from passing on the cost of the excise tax
to retailers and imposing maximum profit margins on sales by
wholesalers to retailers.
   Puerto Rico's regulations, challenged in a lawsuit by oil
companies, were supported by the Reagan administration and state
and local officials. The National Governors' Association, the
National Association of Counties and the U.S. Conference of Mayors
were among the groups that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor
of Puerto Rico.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did not take part in Tuesday's
ruling.
   In other action, the Supreme Court:
   _Ruled, 5-3, that the government's planned development of part
of the Six Rivers National Forest in California does not violate
Indians' religious rights. The decision revived the federal
government's plans to harvest timber and improve a road in an area
considered sacred by three tribes.
   _Made it easier, by an 8-1 vote in an Oklahoma case, for
creditors to recover debts owed by a dead person by requiring
generally that they be notified directly when the debtor's will is
reviewed in court.
   _Ruled against a group of Minnesota welfare recipients who said
they were given inadequate notice about a change in their
eligibility for federal benefits. The 5-3 ruling said states are
not required to provide advance written notice about the effects of
1981 changes in eligibility requirements of the Aid to Families
with Dependent Children program.

<TEXT>
   A court convicted Abbas Hamadi
on Tuesday of abducting two West Germans as ransom for his brother,
Mohammed, who is accused of hijacking a TWA jetliner.
   Abbas Hamadi, 29, was sentenced to 13 years in prison after
being found guilty on all charges of kidnapping, coercion and
possession of explosives.
   ``It is totally reprehensible to rob two innocent people of
their freedom and make them fear for their lives,'' Chief Judge
Arend said in explaining the sentence he and his four colleagues
meted out to Hamadi.
   The 13-year term was 18 months longer than the prosecution
requested. The maximum allowed was 15 years.
   Hamadi, who is bearded and wore a sport coat and open-necked
shirt, slumped into his chair after hearing the verdict and
remained silent. More than 100 spectators, most of them reporters,
were in the room.
   Mohammed Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport Jan. 13, 1987,
and Abbas 13 days later, both with explosives in their possession.
Mohammed Hamadi is accused in the June 1985 hijacking of a TWA
jetliner to Beirut in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed and 39
Americans were held hostage for 17 days.
   Both Hamadis were living in West Germany at the time of their
arrests. After Mohammed Hamadi was jailed, but while his brother
was free, two West Germans were kidnapped in Beirut: Rudolf Cordes
on Jan. 17 and Alfred Schmidt on Jan. 20.
   Schmidt was released in September, but Cordes remains a hostage.
   Arend said the evidence proved Abbas Hamadi was among radical
Shiite Moslems who plotted the kidnappings to try to block Mohammed
Hamadi's extradition to the United States. West Germany has refused
extradition and assigned Mohammed Hamadi's case to juvenile court
for trial.
   In Washington, deputy State Department spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley said: ``We commend today's action by the West German court,
which sends a clear signal to terrorists.''
   Defense lawyer Eckart Hild said he would appeal and told
reporters: ``I do not find this judgment at all convincing.'' Abbas
Hamadi denied involvement in the kidnappings but admitted storing
explosives near his home in Saarland state for his younger brother.
   The chief judge said in court: ``After the arrest of Mohammed
Hamadi, the group in Beirut considered whether to attack the West
German Embassy in Lebanon, hijack a German airliner or kidnap a
German citizen,'' and decided on kidnapping.
   An older Hamadi brother, Abdul-Hadi, also was among the
plotters, Arend said. He is security chief in Beirut for Hezbollah
(Party of God), a Shiite Moslem group allied with Iran.
   In the 3{-month trial of Abbas Hamadi, the court heard tapped
telephone conversations between him and Lebanese friends in West
Germany indicating he was among the plotters. A compelling piece of
evidence was a letter Schmidt sent to his mother from captivity
that bore Hamadi's fingerprints.
   ``There is no doubt the fingerprints are those of Abbas
Hamadi,'' Arend said.
   He said evidence showed the defendant acted as an interpreter
during questioning of the hostaged soon after their abductions.
Abbas Hamadi has spent several years in West Germany and is fluent
in the language, but was in Beirut when Schmidt and Cordes were
kidnapped.
   Abbas Hamadi threatened Schmidt at one point while holding a gun
and also struck him with his hand, Arend said.
   ``The accused demanded that Schmidt hand over the addresses of
other Germans in Beirut,'' which indicating the kidnappers were
seeking more victims, the judge declared.
   Schmidt testified at the trial that he and Cordes were chained
to a wall for four months.
   ``Animals should not be treated the way the hostages have been
treated,'' Arend said, looking directly at Hamadi.
   He said Hezbollah planned to take the explosives stored near
Abbas Hamadi's home to France for terrorist acts. The judge did not
elaborate.
   According to Arend, evidence showed Abbas Hamadi also was guilty
of coercion. That charge stemmed from the kidnappers' threat to
kill their hostages if Mohammed Hamadi was given to the United
States.
   West Germany rejected the extradition request last year and said
he would be tried here.
   No trial date has been set for Mohammed Hamadi, whose case was
turned over to juvenile court. Prosecutors' files show he now is
23, but judicial officials say there is some question about his age
at the time the hijacking was planned.

<HEAD>Diary Details Theft By Student Patrol Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twelve University of Illinois students
have been dropped from the student campus patrol and two of them
face criminal charges of stealing from the offices they were
assigned to protect.
   Not all 12 were involved in crimes, but some knew and did not
inform supervisors, said university Police Chief Paul Dollins.
   Dollins said he won't abolish the 4-year-old program, in which
about 60 students are paid $3.50 an hour to patrol the campus.
   ``When we first started, the students were motivated out of a
desire to provide public safety on campus,'' said Dollins. ``We
need to get students with qualities of courage and integrity on
board.''
   One of the 12 student patrol members, John Boch, gave police his
diary detailing some of the incidents.
   ``I discover that Turner Plant Sciences building is easy-open
city with my trusty ... pocketknife,'' Boch wrote in the diary.
``God, this job is just practice breaking and entering.''
   Boch and the other 11 face possible university disciplinary
action.
   Boch said ``it was sort of a game'' to get into offices, where
he allegedly took small items such as stationery and pens.
   However, Boch said that when he discovered another patrol member
was stealing more valuable items, he told the student patrol
coordinator and handed over his diary.
   Champaign County State's Attorney Tom Difanis later charged two
patrol members, one with burglary, felony theft and misdemeanor
theft and the other with misdemeanor theft.
   Boch will not face criminal charges, said Difanis.
   ``It's silly little things,'' Boch's diary said. ``You can call
it burglary and theft if you want, but we didn't see it as crime
per se.''
   He added: ``I see in hindsight I shouldn't have kept a diary.''

<HEAD>Single-Family Housing Starts Up Sharply for Second Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction of single-family homes rose
sharply in March for the second consecutive month, the government
said Tuesday, offering evidence of a healthy building season this
spring.
   However, a steep decline in apartment construction held the
overall level of housing starts to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 1.54 million units in March, a modest 1.9 percent increase
over the previous month, the Commerce Department said.
   Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, said the March increase, coupled with an overall 9.6
percent jump in February, provide evidence that housing has
recovered from its slump in December and January.
   Housing starts plummeted 15.8 percent in December, the sharpest
monthly decline in more than three years, and drifted another 1.2
percent lower in January. Analysts attributed the decline to
builders' fear that the October stock market crash would dampen
home buying and to the pre-crash buildup in mortgage interest rates.
   ``Whatever problems there might have been in the worst of the
winter months, housing seems to have recovered pretty much,''
Obrinsky said. ``It's not going to be a boom year for housing, but
the decline from last year should be pretty moderate.''
   Housing construction hit an eight-year high of 1.81 million
units in 1986 and fell 10 percent in 1987. Analysts are projecting
another 4 percent to 8 percent decline this year.
   Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America, said lower interest rates, strong
employment gains and the rebound in consumer confidence after the
crash ``are the ingredients we need for a good spring buying
season.''
   However, he warned, ``we have to anticipate that rising mortgage
interest rates will lead to a tailing off in the second half of the
year.''
   Rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages, which shot up above
11.5 percent before the stock market crash, dipped below 10 percent
in February and March before rising to 10.19 percent last week.
Economists are projecting rates of about 11 percent by the end of
the year.
   Housing permits, considered a good sign of future economic
activity, also rose in March, moving up 2.1 percent to an annual
rate of 1.45 million units.
   The strength in starts last month came in construction of
single-family housing, which rose 7.1 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.18 million units after an even stronger
8.9 percent climb in February.
   Construction of multi-family units fell 12.3 percent to an
annual rate of 358,000 units. The construction of buildings with
five or more units was at its lowest rate since June 1982, during
the last recession.
   Apartment construction has been in a slump because the new tax
law passed in 1986 removed many of the tax shelter benefits of
investing in real estate. Also, the old law had encouraged
overbuilding in some areas.
   ``Multi-family housing starts are in a range that we are going
to have to get used to for most of this year and perhaps much of
next year, until vacancy rates come down,'' said Martin A. Regalia,
chief economist of the National Council of Savings Institutions.
   Regionally, the West posted the strongest gain in March, 18.7
percent. Starts also rose in the Midwest, by 2.7 percent. Housing
starts fell 5.8 percent in the South and 3.5 percent in the
Northeast.

<HEAD>Thiokol, NASA Enter Final Test Phase Before Shuttle Flights Resume</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIGHAM CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The third full-scale firing of a
redesigned solid fuel booster rocket for the space shuttle was
scheduled for Wednesday with deliberate flaws built in to test
safety features.
   The two-minute firing of the 126-foot-long, 1.2 million-pound
booster was scheduled for 3 p.m. EDT at Morton Thiokol's Wasatch
Operations plant 25 miles west of Brigham City.
   ``This is a really important milestone in the resumption of
flight,'' said company spokesman Rocky Raab. ``In a sense, it's the
culmination of the redesign effort of two years. If all three of
the (final) tests proceed satisfactorily, the launch preparations
proceed.''
   The horizontal test is designed to reveal any weaknesses in
booster, which was redesigned after the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of
the shuttle Challenger.
   The disaster, which killed Challenger's seven-member crew, was
blamed on a flawed booster rocket seal that allowed blazing exhaust
to escape through a joint in the side and ignite the shuttle's
external liquid fuel tank.
   Wednesday's test is the first in the last series of firings
planned by Morton Thiokol and NASA before the shuttle's first
post-Challenger launch, scheduled for mid-August. Other full-scale
tests are scheduled for June and July.
   The rocket for Wednesday's test was assembled with deliberate
flaws in sealing material in the joints between segments of the
booster. Flawed seals have been tested previously in short-duration
tests, but never in a full-scale firing, Raab said.
   In one joint, a defect was cut into the surface of a J-shaped
seal where sections of insulation meet inside the rocket casing.
The defect could let hot gas penetrate the insulation and hit the
innermost of three O-rings. In the short-duration tests, the defect
sealed itself during firing and gas did not reach the O-ring.
   In another joint a small ``blowhole'' was created in the
adhesive that binds the insulation to the rocket casing. In
short-duration tests, hot gases have followed the blowhole to a new
O-ring, but have not gone beyond it.
   The test comes at a critical time for Morton Thiokol. The
company is NASA's sole supplier of booster rockets, and views a
successful launch as a sign the stigma of the Challenger tragedy
can be set aside.
   While praising Morton Thiokol's work in the redesign effort,
NASA also has asked Congress for a $1.2 million government plant to
build its own boosters.
   Though not related to the shuttle program, the company's image
also was tarnished by the deaths of five employees in a Dec. 29
fire that destroyed a first-stage MX missile rocket motor.
   State safety inspectors cited Morton Thiokol for alleged safety
violations, which are being contested by the company.
   But both Air Force and Morton Thiokol investigators concluded
the workers violated company safety rules by being in the building
during a critical stage of the fueling process that normally is
carried out by remote control.
   Raab said confidence at the company remains high.
   ``The morale here is extremely good as far as the redesign and
success we've had to date,'' Raab said. ``What most people don't
realize is this redesign effort is about three times as intricate
as the original design process, and is being completed in half the
time.''

   At least two of the injured were seriously hurt, officials said.
   First police reports said it appeared that a ``bomb or grenade''
had been thrown against the center, but there were later reports
the blast occurred in an electric transformer.
   The force of the explosion broke windows in nearby cars.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Mark Krischick said, ``Preliminary
information available to us, is that it was not a bomb but a
malfunction of electrical equipment on a power line.''
   He said he based that conclusion on statements from police,
embassy workers and witnesses and on the types of injuries
sustained.
   The cultural center is sponsored by the U.S. Embassy.

<HEAD>Florida To Seed Keys Waters With 10,000 Baby Conchs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State marine biologists plan to salt the waters off
the Florida Keys this summer with 10,000 baby queen conchs in hopes
of rebuilding the population of shellfish that gave the Keys their
nickname _ the Conch Republic.
   The goal is a conch population large enough to allow private and
commercial fisherman to again harvest the key ingredient for conch
chowder and conch fritters.
   It's unknown if the year-old seedlings, raised under controlled
conditions, will survive in Keys waters.
   ``Hopefully, our project will be the start of a continuous
seeding program in which we will be putting 50,000 conch into the
water each year,'' said Carl Berg, who heads the Florida Department
of Natural Resources seeding project.
   Queen conch had become so rare in the Keys two years ago that
former state Rep. Joe Allen of Key West obtained a state ban on
harvesting and a $265,000 grant for the reseeding program.
   Over-harvesting was the main reason the shellfish were
endangered in South Florida.
   Since the ban, most of the conch meat has been shipped to Miami
from places such as Honduras, Colombia and Haiti. Last year,
according to Berg, 1.73 million pounds were imported _ about 8
million conchs.
   Each of the seedlings has been tagged so its progress can be
monitored. Berg said it takes three to four years for a conch to
reach maturity.

   The ``preppie'' killer who strangled a young
woman in Central Park was transferred Tuesday to the
maximum-security Downstate Correctional Facility.
   Robert Chambers will spend two to six weeks in orientation in
the prison at Fishkill, and may serve his entire sentence there,
said City Correction Department spokeswoman Ruby Ryles. He had been
at the city's Rickers Island prison.
   Chambers, 21, was sentenced Friday to five to 15 years as part
of a March 25 deal in which he pleaded guilty to first-degree
manslaughter in the August 1986 death of Jennifer Levin, 18.
   The jury in his murder trial was in its ninth day of
deliberations after a nearly three-month trial when Chambers
pleaded guilty, admitting he had tried to injure Miss Levin
seriously and thereby caused her death.

<HEAD>Reagan Urges Death Penalty Law for Drug Traffickers Who Kill
Police</HEAD>

   President Reagan appealed to Congress on
Tuesday to ``send our own message to people who kill cops'' by
passing legislation providing for the death penalty for the slaying
of officers enforcing drug laws.
   The president spoke at a memorial ceremony for police officers
and others who have lost their lives in the line of duty while
investigating illegal drug trafficking.
   ``Six months ago I sent to Congress legislation which says that
when narcotics racketeers kill and are convicted they will face
execution,'' Reagan said.
   He said the House approved similar legislation in 1986, but
neither the House nor Senate judiciary committees has taken up his
measure this year.
   ``It is time to back up the rhetoric on the drug problem with
action, and I call on the House and Senate to vote promptly on my
bill providing for capital punishment when a death results from
drug dealing and when a Drug Enforcement Administration or other
law enforcement officer is murdered,'' the president said.
   ``When drug syndicates commit murder, our sympathy should be
with the victims, not the killers,'' he said. ``It's time for us to
send our own message to people who kill cops.''
   Reagan also said that liberal politicians and others who took a
permissive attitude toward drugs in the 1960s share the blame for
the deaths of officers enforcing the drug laws now.
   ``Some liberal politicians decried our restrictions on drugs as
conservative, moralistic, reactionary and old fashioned, or simply
remained silent that there even was a drug problem,'' he said.
   ``Many universities adopted a hands-off attitude toward
so-called recreational drug use, and the entertainment industry
produced films and music that promoted and legitimized drug use,''
Reagan said.
   ``The truth was that drugs are killers but for nearly a
generation this vital message was ignored by a whole group of
people who should have known better.''
   ``The leaders of that destructive generation remain the
forgotten accomplices in the epidemic of illegal drug use,'' he
said. ``They cannot escape blame when a law enforcement officer
dies in the battle.''
   The ceremony, held in a White House office building, was
attended by law enforcement officers, families of slain officers
and members of Congress.
   At one point, Reagan led the group in a moment of silence, and
then said, ``Amen. We rededicate ourselves to continue their
struggle.''
   First lady Nancy Reagan, who has campaigned actively against
drug use, joined her husband on the platform, but did not speak.
   Jose Martinez, a federal drug enforcement agent who was wounded
during a heroin investigation near Los Angeles in which two of his
colleagues were killed, told the group that his fellow agents
``were victims of society's demand to satisfy their desire for
drugs.''
   ``Not until people quit using drugs will it become safe for
those of us in law enforcement and the rest of society,'' Martinez
said.

   The Federal Election Commission fined
President Reagan's campaign committee $10,000 for accepting
excessive contributions in the 1984 primary election, newly
released records show.
   The commission is winding up its work on the 1984 election, and
documents released Monday include a Jan. 26 settlement signed by
the Reagan committee.
   An audit by the FEC found that Reagan accepted more than the
$1,000 maximum from 285 individuals, for a total of $193,674 in
excess receipts.
   Of that, the campaign transferred $172,624 into a fund used to
comply with various FEC regulations in the general election. But
such a transfer is legal only if the donors give written
permission, which was not obtained in the case of Reagan's
campaign, the commission report said.
   Most of the rest of the money was refunded to the donors,
``although not within a reasonable time,'' according to the
settlement agreement signed by the FEC and the Reagan committee
treasurer, Angela Buchanan Jackson.
   Five thousand dollars was later listed in the names of spouses
of original donors, but that procedure, too, requires written
authorization from the contributors and spouses, and the
authorization was not given.
   Spending and contribution limits apply to all candidates who
receive federal matching funds for their presidential campaigns.
   The two party nominees for the general election receive all
their campaign funds from the federal pot and do not have to raise
any money on their own. In the primary elections, however, they
must raise money privately that can be matched from the federal
fund.
   The fund is supported by the voluntary $1 checkoff on income tax
returns.
   This year, the FEC will give the Democratic and Republican
nominees $27 million each for the general election campaign.

   A polka dot dress, bullets taken from
victims and a hand-scrawled notation that ``RFK must die'' were
among pieces of evidence put on display today as officials opened
secret records on the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy.
   The exhibits mounted on boards and in glass cases were samples
of the voluminous files examined by state archivists and were put
on display to illustrate key points in the investigation as
authorities released the material.
   The police files on Kennedy's shooting could shed new light on
persistent questions about whether Sirhan Bishara Sirhan was the
only gunman in the shooting.
   Was Kennedy shot from in front or behind? Were there eight shots
or more in the pantry of the Ambassador Hotel? And how close was
the gunman whose bullet found its fatal path into Kennedy's brain?
   Those questions and others raised by conspiracy theorists and
scholars may be addressed in some 50,000 pages of documents,
interviews with 4,000 witnesses, and 2,500 photographs being
released today by California Secretary of State March Fong Eu.
   ``It has been almost 20 years since that awful night at the
Ambassador (Hotel), a night which ended one life and changed so
many others,'' Eu said as she formally ordered the materials made
public.
   Among the disputed facts verified by the documents was an
admission by police that they destroyed key evidence in the case,
including ceiling tiles, a door jamb and thousands of photographs
taken in the Ambassador Hotel kitchen where Kennedy was shot on
June 5, 1968.
   An official record in the evidence showed that 2,410 photographs
were burned on Aug. 21, 1968. It gives no reason for their burning.
   The polka dot dress was one of many purchased by police in an
effort to jog the memories of witnesses on a point of contention _
whether a girl in a polka dot dress was seen running from the
Ambassador Hotel shouting, ``We shot him.'' That report was never
verified.
   One entire case of evidence contained items from Sirhan's
Pasadena home. Among the items was the now-famous diary in which
Sirhan scrawled in pencil his plans to kill the New York senator.
   ``My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more the more of
an unshakeable obsession,'' he wrote. Under a series of doodles was
the statement, ``RFK must die.''
   Also included was sign-in sheet from a San Gabriel Valley gun
club which showed that Sirhan visited there on June 4, 1968.
   The key question is whether Sirhan, a Jordanian immigrant
serving a life sentence for the crime, was the lone assassin of the
Democratic presidential hopeful.
   On the eve of the release of the files, Sirhan's attorney, Luke
McKissack, said Sirhan expects nothing to contradict his
frequently-stated claim that he was a lone gunman.
   McKissack said that although Sirhan maintains he doesn't
remember shooting Kennedy, Sirhan believes he was motivated by
anger over the Arab loss in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   McKissack said that Sirhan, who is serving his sentence at
Soledad Prison, has given up hope that he will ever be paroled.
   Eu and California Archivist John Burns say they hope the release
of the Los Angeles Police Department investigative file will
satisfy the public's right to know everything about the event.
   ``There should no longer be any speculation about what the
police found,'' Burns said.
   The release follows years of demands for public access to the
information.
   ``This is a kind of vindication of citizens' efforts to force
this material out,'' said Gregory Stone, a political scientist on
leave from the University of Wisconsin who has devoted himself to
studying Kennedy's killing.
   Stone equated its importance with the 1964 publication of the
Warren Commission's investigation of the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's brother.
   The only things withheld from disclosure, Eu said, were autopsy
photos, criminal ``rap sheets'' and fingerprint cards, juvenile
case records, internal police personnel records and records that
originated with the FBI or police departments outside Los Angeles'.
   Burns said the FBI would release its own file at an unspecified
time.
   Eu's spokeswoman, Melissa Warren, said her office had been
inundated with calls since announcing the impending release,
including many from Massachusetts, Kennedy's home state, and New
York, which he represented as a U.S. senator.
   A summary of Los Angeles Police Department files released in
1986 contained a police conclusion tht Sirhan was the lone
assassin. It found no evidence of a second gunman or a conspiracy.
   Sirhan admitted the killing at his 1969 trial but has claimed he
has no memory of the actual shooting. He blames his memory loss on
alcohol.
   Names and details considered sensitive at the time were deleted
from the 1986 summary. It did not fully address questions raised
about forensic evidence involving the gun, autopsy reports and
witness recollections.
   Witnesses told of seeing Sirhan step from behind a steam table
into Kennedy's path as the senator walked toward him. But Los
Angeles County Coroner Thomas Noguchi testified at Sirhan's trial
that Kennedy was killed by a shot fired behind his right ear.
   Conspiracy theorists suggested that a second gunman fired at
Kennedy from behind while Sirhan stood in front of him.

   U.S. Navy warships and helicopters today
searched for a missing U.S. helicopter, Iran attacked two neutral
ships and more mines were sighted in the Persian Gulf.
   Iran claimed it had shot down the helicopter during a sea battle
that raged Monday over much of the southern gulf.
   Iran fired five land-based missiles at U.S. warships during
Monday's fighting, in which American forces destroyed two Iranian
oil platforms and blasted six Iranian vessels.
   Navy officers identified the missiles as Chinese-made Silkworms
but the Pentagon said it had yet to confirm what kind of missiles
whistled past the warships.
   Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told
President Reagan and Republican Congressional leaders that there
was no evidence Iran had fired any Silkworms, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said.
   In avoiding the missiles, the three-ship convoy led by the USS
Jack Williams took evasive action and fired chaff into the air,
which confused the rockets' radar guidance system and caused the
missiles to miss the convoy in the southern gulf.
   Monday's confrontation was the most serious between U.S. and
Iranian forces since the U.S. Navy sent its task force to the gulf
last year.
   Reagan today said the gulf ``seems to be quieting down.''
   Gulf-based maritime salvage experts reported the Iranians
attacked two tankers in the Strait of Hormuz today. Monday they
fired on three neutral ships.
   The salvage experts said one of the two tankers put out a
distress signal at midmorning and gave its name as Meltem. They
could not secure additional details.
   The other tanker, the 12,125-ton Fal-5 from the United Arab
Emirates, was set ablaze but Omani coastguard patrol boats rescued
the crew.
   Mines were spoted by a passing vessel in a central gulf area
where no explosives had earlier been noted, and shipping executives
predicted commercial vessels would be discouraged from sailing in
the region.
   Sources close to the Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. said the convoys of
11 U.S. reflagged Kuwaiti tankers sailing under U.S. Navy
protection were discontinued until a major shipping channel further
north was cleared.
   However, the Pentagon denied that the convoys had been suspended.
   The Pentagon said Monday that U.S raids on the Iranian oil
platforms came in retaliation for a mine strike last Thursday
against the USS Samuel B. Roberts, which injured 10 crewmen.
   Iran said several people were killed or injured in the raids on
the two oil platforms but gave no further details. It has denying
planting the mines.
   No American casualties were reported in Monday's fighting.
However, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said in Washington the
Navy was searching for a Cobra attack helicopter with two crewmen
that had not returned to a cruiser.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, said Monday night that Iranian warships ``in a heroic clash
with the aggressor American helicopters in the Persian Gulf shot
down one of them Monday afternoon.''
   Pentagon officials said the helicopter did not return to the USS
Wainwright Monday after a ``routine reconnaissance mission.''
   The Pentagon identified the helicopter crew as Capt. Stephen C.
Leslie, of New Bern, N.C., and Capt. Kenneth W. Hill, of
Thomasville, N.C. They were assigned to the Marine Corps Air
Station in New River, N.C.
   In its latest report on Monday's fighting, Iran claimed Iranian
gunboats sank a U.S. ship Monday in the southern gulf.
   ``Iranian speedboats spotted and scored direct hits on an
American naval logistical ship sailing in the region, sinking the
vessel with all its crew aboard,'' the agency said today.
   The Pentagon reiterated today that there were no confirmed
casualties Monday.
   Asked about the Iranian report of an American ship being sunk,
Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said: ``No report has reached us from
our forces in the gulf of any hostile acts today.''
   The missile attack Monday represented the first reported firing
of the Silkworm batteries along Iran's coast at ships in the
southern gulf or the Strait of Hormuz, the waterway's narrow
entrance.
   The attack was witnessed by Associated Press correspondent
Richard Pyle who was aboard the Williams with a Pentagon news media
pool.
   Fighting began early Monday when the U.S. Navy blasted two
Iranian oil platforms as a ``measured response'' to mining of the
Roberts.
   U.S. forces then sank an Iranian gunboat defending the
platforms. Later Monday, two Iranian navy frigates fired on U.S.
jets, which then bombed the ships, setting them afire near the
Strait of Hormuz.
   U.S. warships also sank one and damaged two other patrol boats
attacking neutral shipping near the Mubarak oil field, off the
emirate of Sharjah in the southern gulf.
   During the raid at Mubarak, Iranian forces attacked American,
British and Cypriot merchant vessels and a press helicopter.
   About an hour after midnight Sunday, two groups of U.S. Navy
warships struck the Iranian oil platforms Sassan and Sirri-D, 100
miles apart in the southern gulf.
   One platform was destroyed by naval gunfire and the other by
explosives placed on it by Marines, according to statements in
Washington.
   Carlucci said a Navy helicopter was fired upon during the raid
on the platforms but not hit. Iranians shot at a press helicopter
carrying an NBC-TV crew and Associated Press photographer Norbert
Schiller, but missed.
   Schiller reported today that the Sassan and Sirri-D platforms
had been reduced to charred ruins and appeared abandoned after the
U.S. attack.
   After the platform attack, an Iranian patrol boat fired at the
U.S. cruiser Wainwright, one of the attacking ships, but missed.
The frigate Simpson sank the Iranian boat, the Pentagon said.
   In late afternoon, the Iranian frigates, the Sahand and the
Sabalan, were hit by American bombs and missiles after they fired
on U.S. jets.

<HEAD>Dukakis-Jackson Square Off in New York; Gore Makes a Stand</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Polls close at 9 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, seeking ``signs of things to
come,'' squared off against Jesse Jackson in a raucous New York
primary Tuesday as he bid for control over the race for the 1988
Democratic presidential nomination.
   Jackson hoped for an upset that would propel his candidacy
through the final six weeks of primaries, while Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. struggled simply to survive.
   New York's millions rendered their primary verdict while
Democratic senators met behind closed doors in the Capitol to
select 43 delegates to the party's national convention. Dukakis won
13 pledges and outdueled Gore, who gained six as well as his own.
Jackson was shut out, with the majority of senators remaining
uncommitted.
   Vice President George Bush was the winner for sure on the
Republican ballot, with no serious opposition in New York or
elsewhere. New York offered 96 delegates for the vice president,
steadily closing in on the 1,139 needed to secure his nomination at
the Republican National Convention in August.
   New York was the biggest single-state primary night so far this
year, offering 255 delegates and a shining opportunity for Dukakis
to assert control over the Democratic race. He'd won two primaries
and two caucuses since his stinging defeat to Jackson in Michigan
three weeks ago.
   In the next few weeks, Dukakis' primary prospects appeared
bright. New York offered Jackson an unusually high percentage of
black voters that won't be available to him in upcoming states. And
already there was talk of Gore skipping Pennsylvania next week;
that would leave Dukakis as the only white candidate in the race.
   Dukakis began the day leading in the competition for national
convention delegates. The Associated Press count showed the
Massachusetts governor with 880 delegates, to 745 for Jackson and
419 for Gore. It takes 2,082 to gain the nomination at the party
convention.
   The New York primary campaign proved to be a ferocious affair
that exposed deep racial and religious divisions among New Yorkers,
featuring an almost daily tongue-lashing from Mayor Ed Koch
directed at Jackson.
   Jackson sought to remain above the fray, although he said on the
day before the primary that ``we have received more death threats
in this campaign than in all the other combined because the climate
has been so divisive and so violent.''
   Jackson hailed a solid victory over Dukakis in the Delaware
caucuses on Monday and said it was a sign of things to come.
``Delaware was the hors d'oeuvre, New York is a four-course meal,''
he said. He campaigned through the morning of primary day in hopes
of boosting turnout in predominantly black areas in New York City
where his support was strongest.
   Dukakis greeted morning commuters at a subway stop in Queens in
New York City before returning to Massachusetts to spend the day.
   Gore was a distant third in public opinion surveys, despite a
costly effort designed to reinvigorate a campaign that has been
moribund since Super Tuesday six weeks ago. He spent primary
morning campaigning in New York as aides passed the word that they
expected the senator to gain less than 10 percent of the New York
vote _ a performance that would raise questions about his ability
to continue.
   Dukakis, normally the most cautious of candidates, predicted in
the final hours of the New York campaign that he would score a
victory that would place him firmly on the path toward the
nomination.
   ``It's been a terrific, exciting, interesting couple of weeks
and I hope if all goes well today, a sign of things to come,'' he
said.
   Interesting hardly began to describe the multi-million dollar
campaign to appeal to the state's many and far-flung ethnic and
religious groups. The state's two prominent Democrats captured
their share of the limelight: Koch endorsed Gore when he wasn't
attacking Jackson, and Gov. Mario Cuomo declined to endorse anyone
while finally ruling out accepting a draft.

<HEAD>NEW YORK: a draft.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   At times, it seemed Dukakis, Jackson and Gore were mere
bystanders peering into the ever-bubbling New York political
cauldron.
   Cuomo played the role of emcee, meeting with Jackson and
Dukakis, speaking nicely of them as well as Gore, but not endorsing
anyone.
   Some divined a preference for Dukakis; when Cuomo urged party
leaders to express a preference for a candidate, many of them
flocked to the Massachusetts governor's side.
   But there was confusion aplenty when the governor and his aides
offered multiple explanations of whether he would accept a draft at
the party nomination convention. Asked if he would utter a simple
yes or no answer to the question, he replied, ``Yes or no.''
   Koch provided much of the fireworks, first saying that Jews
would have to be ``crazy'' to vote for Jackson, then saying that
the former civil rights leader ``under stress is not capable of
telling the truth.''
   Gore, who ardently sought Koch's backing in hopes of cutting
into Dukakis' support among Jews and other residents of New York
City, declared by the end of the campaign that the mayor was
``speaking for himself.''
   Jackson's campaign manager, Gerald Austin, returned fire. Koch,
he said, ``is a lunatic.''
   Dukakis wanted none of that fight, but he had trials of his own.
   He was upbraided at one campaign stop in Harlem for not doing
more to contest Jackson for black votes, and spent several hours
ducking reporters one day who wanted to ask him about the Reagan
administration's decision to bomb Iranian oil platforms in the
Persian Gulf.
   He was thrown off-stride briefly when he refused to rule out
creation of a Palestinian state, and again when Gore pounced upon a
remark concerning the possible use of nuclear weapons in the event
of a Soviet invasion of Europe.
   Bush watched from a distance. He divided time between next
week's primary state of Pennsylvania and Washington, where he
attended official meetings on the Iranian military situation.
   ``I can't wait for the debates with the Democratic nominee no
matter who it turns out to be,'' he said.
   ``Even if they unleash Mario Cuomo, I can't wait.''

   A citizens' group, concerned that a new type
of discrimination will evolve once scientists have cracked the
human genetic code, proposed Tuesday that a federal commission be
established to advise on how to control the new gene technology.
   Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends
and an active opponent of some biological research projects, said
he is organizing the citizens' group as a result of plans for the
government to finance research that would map the human genetic
code.
   The genetic code forms the blueprint for all human physical
characteristics. It determines why some people have blue eyes and
blond hair, and others have brown hair and brown eyes. It also
gives a predisposition for some illnesses and disabilities.
   Rifkin said that once the genetic code, or genome, is known
there is a possibility that this will be used by employers,
insurance companies and others to discriminate against people whose
genetic make up includes potential disease-causing defects.
   ``A new kind of discrimination will arise, not based on skin
color, but on genetic makeup,'' Rifkin said at a news conference.
``We don't want to see the emergence of a commercial genetic
discrimination in this country.''
   Rifkin said his group is proposing that organizing and financing
a citizens' commission on genetic ethics be a part of any
legislation that would finance research on the human genome.
   Earlier this year the National Academy of Sciences proposed that
the government finance a $3 billion effort to map the function of
the 100,000 genes that make up the human genetic code. The project
is now being considered by Congress.
   Rifkin said funds should not be provided for the scientific
research unless money also is appropriated to control the
application of knowledge developed by the technical research.
   Without such controls, he said, ``we face the very real
possibility of a new form of eugenics in this country.'' Eugenics
is the concept of improving the human species by controlling
hereditary factors through controlled mating or through genetics.
   Rifkin said some legislators have agreed to introduce
legislation requiring the genetics advisory board, but he declined
to name sponsors of the legislation.
   He said the commission is supported by what he said were ``70
prominent national leaders'' of civil rights, labor, disability
rights and religious groups. Seven representatives from those
groups attended the news conference.
   Deborah Kaplan, a California attorney and a disability rights
activists, said the genetics research could be used by employers to
exclude some people from jobs. She said many disabled workers now
are denied jobs for medical reasons and the genetic technology
``could provide more sophisticated means of screening people out of
jobs that they could do.''
   This would be done, she said, by labeling people based on their
genetic potential for illness or disability.
   ``There are too many labels now,'' she said, ``and this will
give us still more labels we can apply to people.''
   Rabbi David Saperstein, representing a Washington center of
reform Judaism, said new knowledge such as the genetic code must be
carefully applied because there no longer is room for technological
error.
   ``This is the first generation of humanity that does not have
the benefit of making mistakes in applying technology,'' he said.
``All of human history is a test run for this moment.''
   He said that because of the eugenics experiments conducted on
Jews by the Nazis in World War II his religious community is
particularly sensitive to the application of new genetic knowledge.
   Rifkin said the proposed commission, to be called the Human
Genome Policy Board, would comprise 12 members, six each selected
by the House and the Senate. He said the board would appoint a
committee of 18 that broadly would represent all special interest
groups concerned with issues of genetics.
   He said the proposal would include an appropriation of $3.5
million to finance the work of the board and the committee.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS JACK WILLIAMS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The warning ``Silkworm
incoming!'' blared five times from the bridge of the USS Jack
Williams but all five Iranian missiles missed the three-ship U.S.
Navy attack group.
   The missiles flew from Iran's anti-ship missile batteries Monday
as the Navy attacked two Iranian oil platforms in the southern
Persian Gulf in retaliation for a mine that blew a hole in a U.S.
frigate last week.
   Officers on the Williams, which led the ``surface action
group,'' identified the missiles as Chinese-built Silkworms but the
Pentagon and Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, did not confirm it. The Pentagon said Tuesday it was still
analyzing the attack.
   With the first warning of ``Silkworm incoming!'' the Jack
Williams lurched into violent maneuvers and crewmen scrambled.
   ``Everybody look astern! Everybody look astern!'' Lt. Augustino
Ponturier, officer of the deck, shouted to junior officers and
lookouts.
   The guided missile frigate rolled sharply and pointed its stern
toward the approaching missile, presenting its smallest target and
allowing the aluminum-chaff launchers and other defensive weapons a
clear shot.
   None of the first four rockets came close enough to be seen but
members of a helicopter crew and a fire detail hit the deck as the
fifth crossed behind the ship and slammed into a distant oil rig
with an orange-yellow flash.
   Officers aboard the ship were elated with the response system.
   ``Not one of these ladies has a scratch on her, and the other
guys can't say that,'' said Capt. Don Dyer, operational commander
of the force.
   In all, six Iranian ships were damaged by U.S. fire Monday.
   Dyer said a C-130 aircraft spotting targets for the Iranian
batteries was tracked by U.S. jets from the nuclear-powered
aircraft carrier Enterprise and was almost shot down.
   U.S. officials reported one U.S. helicopter with two crew
members aboard missing Monday, and the search continued Tuesday.
They denied Iranian claims that the aircraft was shot down.
   The Williams, with members of a Pentagon news media pool aboard,
was the operational flagship for one of the three ``surface action
groups'' involved in the fighting Monday in the southern gulf. Also
in the group were the destroyers Joseph Strauss and O'Brien.
   Monday's operations began when U.S. warships destroyed two
Iranian oil platforms.
   Over the next few hours, Navy forces sank two missile-armed
patrol boats, damaged two others and bombed and rocketed two
frigates.
   One of the Iranian frigates, the Sahand, was hit by a Harpoon
missile fired from the Strauss.
   The white missile roared skyward in a cloud of smoke and
streaked for the horizon. The men on the Williams' bridge cheered:
``Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!''
   A flash and white smoke erupted on the horizon, followed by a
long series of heavy explosions as the weapons and ammunition
aboard the Sahand blew up.
   Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke, a spokesman for the Navy's Joint Task
Force Middle East, said a U.S. pilot who observed the Sahand
reported it ``listing badly, with a big hole in its port side, the
superstructure on fire and a lifeboat with some survivors in the
water.''
   Soon afterward, F-14 jet fighters from the Enterprise attacked
the Sahand's sister frigate Sabalan after it fired a missile at
them.
   U.S. Army Maj. Barry Willey, a Central Command officer
accompanying the media pool, described the view from the Williams
bridge as ``both spectacular and frightening _ contrails from
missiles could be seen in almost every direction.''
   The oil platform attacks were aimed at what U.S. officials
called military targets. Both the Sassan and Sirri-D platforms have
been used by for military purposes, they say.
   President Reagan ordered the strikes after the frigate Samuel B.
Roberts hit a mine, which U.S. officials say was laid by Iran, in
the central gulf last Thursday. Ten crewman were wounded.
   While other groups attacked the platforms, the Williams' unit
steamed halfway through the Strait or Hormuz, in calm seas, under
clear skies within range of Iranian Silkworm batteries that had not
yet been used in the southern gulf.
   Van Dyke said the mission was to ``exercise the right of
innocent transit passage and respond to all contingencies.''
   That's when the missiles came.
   As the Williams and its accompanying warships sailed out of the
``Silkworm envelope'' later Monday, into safer waters and a setting
sun, the alert level was lowered from ``general quarters'' to the
next lowest ``condition one-alpha.''
   Ponturier, of Red Bank, N.J., took off his steel helmet and
walked toward the door. ``It's Miller time,'' he said.

   President Reagan might veto a massive trade
bill now before Congress, but that action wouldn't directly affect
the free-trade agreement between the United States and Canada,
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Tuesday.
   ``There's nothing that tells me that they're connected,'' Lyng
said. If there is a veto of the sweeping trade bill, Reagan's veto
message would ``describe some reasons that have nothing whatsoever
to do with the free trade agreement with Canada, as far as I can
see.''
   Lawmakers are near final action on the 1,000-page trade bill,
but there have been veto threats over parts the administration find
objectionable, including a provision that would require 60-day
notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   The U.S.-Canada trade pact was signed Jan. 2 but still requires
approval by the Canadian parliament and the U.S. Congress. If
approved, the treaty will take effect Jan. 1, 1989, and will
gradually eliminate all tariffs between the two countries and
address non-tariff barriers.
   According to the Agriculture Department, U.S-Canada trade was
about $124 billion in 1986, of which $4.6 billion was agricultural.
   Lyng appeared at a news conference with Canadian minister of
agriculture, John Wise, following private discussions. Wise said he
was pleased by Lyng's view of the trade bill and said there is
``the absolute need and the absolute necessity for us to join
forces'' in ongoing global talks under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
   ``In fact, I think, were it not for the leadership taken by
Canada and the United States ... we probably wouldn't be at the
stage that we are now in the Uruguay Round of multinational trade
negotiations,'' Wise said.
   Both he and Lyng said the U.S.-Canada free-trade agreement would
help push the cause of global reform.
   ``It would be extremely helpful, I think, to both of us, in
sending a very legitimate and a very concrete message to our other
trading partners, particularly at GATT,'' Wise said.
   In a joint statement later, the two agricultural leaders pledged
to work together ``to ensure that the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development ministerial meeting in May and the
Toronto economic summit in June provide the necessary political
impetus'' for a midterm review of the Uruguay Round next December
in Montreal.

   President Robert Mugabe on Tuesday
announced a general amnesty for armed rebels and political
opponents, saying it was made possible by his recent accord with
longtime rival Joshua Nkomo.
   Mugabe, speaking at a ceremony marking his country's Defense
Forces Day, credited the amnesty to the unity pact signed Dec. 22
with Nkomo, a former opposition leader.
   The unity agreement aims to merge Mugabe's governing Zimbabwe
African National Union with Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union
by year's end.
   Mugabe and Nkomo led allied rebel armies fighting white rule
when Zimbabwe was a British colony known as Rhodesia. When
independence was declared in 1980 and Mugabe became president, some
Nkomo supporters took to the countryside to fight the new black
government.
   On Monday, the eighth anniversary of independence, Mugabe asked
those rebels in western Zimbabwe to surrender. He said about 100
rebels remained at large in Matabeleland, Nkomo's traditional
tribal stronghold.
   Mugabe did not say how many people will be affected by the
amnesty, the first he has offered to opponents. He said it would
also cover political exiles and certain people convicted of minor
crimes.

<TEXT>
   Millionaire executive Ivana Trump and Grace
Sandness, a Minnesota mother of 15, were among seven women honored
Tuesday by the National Mother's Day Committee.
   Mrs. Sandness, a quadriplegic, came from Maple Grove, Minn.,
with three of her children to accept the award for ``contributions
to the role of contemporary motherhood.''
   She and her husband, Dave, a psychologist, have raised 12
adopted children and three foster children _ many of them
handicapped _ over 26 years. She also is working toward a master's
degree in creative writing at the University of Minnesota.
   ``It's been a long, interesting, frustrating and joyous
experience,'' said Mrs. Sandness. ``You enjoy your children. If you
do the best you can, you don't feel guilty if something goes
wrong.''
   Mrs. Trump, who helps her husband, Donald, run a real estate
empire, said they repeatedly emphasize to their three children,
``No smoking, no drugs, no alcohol. Don't cheat and steal and lie.''
   Patti Ann McDonald of Malverne, the youngest winner at age 26,
is raising 15-month-old Conor and assisting in the recovery of her
husband, Steven, a New York City police officer left paralyzed by
an assailant's bullet in 1986.
   Opera singer Regina Resnik, whose son, Michael Philip Davis, is
following in her footsteps, said combining a career and
child-rearing takes ``a great deal of care on the part of both
parents.''
   Laura H. Pomerantz, corporate senior vice president of The
Leslie Fay Cos. and a mother of three daughters, agreed ``there
aren't enough hours in the day'' for parents who also work outside
the home.
   U.S. Rep. Constance A. Morella, R-Md., raised her own three
children and the six children of her late sister. She stressed a
need for ``enough activities and incentive and motivation'' at home
to keep kids away from drugs.
   Judy Muller, a CBS radio correspondent and the single mother of
two teen-age daughters, was asked about the widespread problem of
teen-age pregnancy. ``Ignorance is still rampant and that's how we
get teen-age mothers,'' she said.
   The annual awards are sponsored by the National Mother's Day
Committee, which promotes the May 8 holiday.

   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci refused to
specutlate today on the fate of a Marine helicopter and its two-man
crew missing since American encounters Monday with Iranian forces
in the Persian Gulf.
   Nor would he comment on Iran's claims that its forces had
brought the craft down.
   Carlucci, asked as he left a memorial service for police
officers and others killed enforcing drug laws whether the copter
was considered lost, answered:
   ``I'm not going to speculate. We're continuing to look, and I'm
certainly hopeful.''
   Asked about Iranian claims that its forces had shot the
helicopter down, Carlucci replied, ``I'm not going to get into the
details.''
   The Marine Corps, meanwhile, changed the status of the
helicopter's two crewmen to missing.
   Pentagon Spokesman Dan Howard identified them as Capt. Stephen
C. Leslie, 30, and Capt. Kenneth W. Hill, 33, assigned to Squadron
HMLA-167 based at the New River, N.C., Marine Corps Air Station.
   Leslie claims a home of record of New Bern and Hill a home of
record of Thomasville, N.C., the Pentagon said.
   Howard repeated statements of Monday that the Cobra had been
sent out on a ``standard patrol sweep'' and that there was no
evidence to suggest the copter had ever come under fire.
   As he commented, U.S. Navy ships and planes continued to search
for the Marine Cobra attack helicopter over the central gulf.
   The helicopter did not return to the USS Wainwright Monday after
what Pentagon officials called a ``routine reconnaissance mission.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday
night that Iranian warships, ``in a heroic clash with the aggressor
American helicopters in the Persian Gulf shot down one of them
Monday afternoon.''
   Addressing the search, a Pentagon spokesman, Maj. Charles Boyd,
said today:
   ``There is a very extensive search underway. Numerous ships and
helicopters are involved. The airborne search stopped during the
night and resumed at daylight, but numerous surface ships kept
searching during the night.''
   The helicopter was in the lower central portion of the gulf,
near the area of Monday's heaviest fighting, when it disappeared,
according to the Pentagon, which was not releasing the names of the
two crewmen.
   Another Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col., Arnold Williams, said the
helicopter was assigned to the USS Trenton as part of the Marine
task force protecting Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. The
helicopter was operating temporarily from the Wainwright, a
cruiser, he said.
   Williams said he did not know what radio contact there had been
with the helicopter.
   No American casualties were reported in the initial attacks on
Iranian positions and the later return fire from Iranian speed
boats and land-based missiles.

<HEAD>European Leaders Denounce Mine-Laying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European leaders Tuesday denounced mine-laying in
the Persian Gulf, while Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain
went further and delivered a strong defense of U.S. retaliatory
action against Iran.
   ``I'm in favor of action against those who lay mines against
shipping in the gulf ... and not letting people get away with
constantly causing extra trouble on what should be a free
international seaway,'' Mrs. Thatcher told Parliament, adding:
   ``I fully support the action which the United States took.''
   A French government spokesman said Paris ``is concerned by the
sudden renewal of tension in the gulf.''
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said: ``We reaffirm our
commitment to freedom of navigation in the gulf and demand that the
mining stop'' along with ``all other acts hostile to navigation in
international waters.''
   In reply to a question, he said attacks on merchant shipping
``can only lead to measures of self-defense.''
   Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti said: ``Laying mines
is an illegal act, which puts navigation at risk.'' He said the
U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform and an Iranian
counterattack, ``correspond with the hard logic of military action
and reaction.''
   An Iranian diplomat said the accusation that his country planted
the mines was ``such an absurd thing that one does not have to deny
it.'' He implied Iraq was the culprit, because disruption of gulf
shipping served Iraqi interests.
   ``It was Iraq that attacked the shipping in the Persian Gulf
(and) invited foreign forces to the area ... in order to divert the
attention from the main problem on the battleground,'' said
Akhunzadeh Basti, the Iranian charge d'affaires in London, in a
British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
   Asked whether Iran would attack U.S. targets again, he replied:
``By these actions, they (America) openly committed themselves, or
they made an alliance with the Iraqis. So we see now the Americans
are directly supporting Iraq in a defeated war and if that is their
position, of course there will be countermeasures.''
   Basti was summoned to by British Foreign Office official Alan
Munro who protested about the mining and Iran's attack on the York
Marine a British-owned tanker on lease to a U.S. company.
   In West Germany, the left-leaning Frankfurter Rundschau
newspaper said that militarily, Washington ``can be satisfied with
the results of the attacks against two Iranian oil platforms in the
gulf.''
   However, it said, ``in another way the attack did not work as
planned in Washington'' because Iran responded to the action by
attacking the York Marine.
   ``This means a dangerous escalation of the already tense
situation between the United States and Iran in the gulf, and
confirms the fears of Congress that the United States could be
drawn into a broad military conflict in the gulf,'' the paper said.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Incest to Blame for High Infant Mortality in
Turkmenia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet newspaper on Tuesday blamed high infant
mortality in the Central Asian republic of Turkmenia on widespread
incest among rural residents who intermarry to avoid paying huge
dowries demanded by tradition.
   The youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a doctor in the
village of Yagtylyk as saying that at one nearby collective farm,
there are 90 families in which the parents are close relatives, and
71 of them had borne children who died within a year.
   The newspaper did not make clear how much of the republic's high
incidence of infant mortality was attributable to incest, but said
it was ``a high percentage.''
   A Soviet sociology journal last year reported that the infant
mortality rate in Turkmenia is more than twice the Soviet national
average, which itself ranks 50th in the world, behind most
developed countries.
   The journal, Sociological Research, said 58.2 of every 1,000
children born in the Central Asian republic die within a year. The
national infant mortality rate in the Soviet Union in 1986 was 25.4
per 1,000. Infant mortality in the United States that year was 10.4
per 1,000 births.
   ``They knock us doctors for the high infant mortality rate,''
Khodzhamurad Makhemov, a pediatric specialist in Turkmenia's
Takhtinsky region told the newspaper. ``Yet we are powerless in the
case of the death of a child of related parents.''
   The report referred to the case of a 30-year-old woman in the
region who married her first cousin and gave birth to eight
children. Five of them died before reaching age one.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said 164 cases of infant mortality
attributable to incest had been found in the one village, Yagtylyk,
the population of which was not given and is too small to be
included in the annual national economic report. The article
speculated, however, that a similar situation existed throughout
the rural regions of the republic of about 3.3 million people.
   Intermarriage in the republic has not fallen off in recent
years, the newspaper said, blaming the practice on ``those who
support dowry ransoms, the buying and selling of Turkmenian girls.''
   Rural families that cannot afford to pay thousands of rubles to
an outside family encourage their children to marry within, the
newspaper said.
   The article quoted local marriage office workers as saying they
are powerless to prevent intermarriage, and called for changes in
the republic's legal code to deter close relatives from marrying.
   It noted, however, that traditions in rural regions are not so
easily broken, and that many of the related couples who arrive at
public offices to register their weddings do so only after they
``in fact have already become husband and wife.''
   Turkmenia, like most of Central Asia, is populated mostly by
Moslems, who marry in religious ceremonies and register with Soviet
authorities as a formality.
   The article, titled ``Marrying ... a Brother,'' also called on
teachers and health care workers to inform rural residents of the
genetic dangers involved in bearing children with a close relative.

<TEXT>
   In a move to double its space, the Pierpont
Morgan Library will buy, renovate and occupy a 136-year-old
brownstone mansion next door, it was announced Tuesday.
   The research library and museum has agreed to pay the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which is moving its offices
to Chicago, $15 million for the mansion.
   ``One of the great appeals of the library has always been its
intimate, human scale,'' Charles E. Pierce Jr., the library
director, said. ``People should be reassured that we have no
intention of undermining this.''
   The mansion, in midtown Manhattan, will provide space for
exhibitions, storage, educational programs and offices, he said.
   Michael Kaiser, associate director, said the library may use its
archive of Morgan family possessions, including furniture and
decorations, to create some period rooms. In all, the library will
spend about $5 million restoring and renovating the house.
   The mansion was built in 1852 as the residence of Anson Phelps
Stokes, a financier and heir to the Phelps, Dodge copper fortune.
In 1904 it was bought by J. Pierpont Morgan as a home for his son,
J.P. Morgan Jr. The elder Morgan had lived in a brownstone next
door since 1880.
   The 45-room house, which has 22 fireplaces and 12 baths, was
purchased after J.P. Morgan's death by the Lutheran Church, which
added a five-story annex in 1957.
   Morgan began his art collection while a student in Europe,
gathering bits of glass from the shattered windows of old churches
and cathedrals. In 1906 Morgan built a library to store his
collection, and in 1928 his son built an annex on the site of
Pierpont Morgan's home.
   The library, a national historic landmark since 1966, was
designed by Charles Follen McKim and built of fitted marble blocks.
   The library prides itself on its collections of medieval and
Renaissance illuminated manuscripts, master drawings, early printed
books and bookbindings.
   The collection includes three Gutenberg Bibles, a 1477 printing
of Chaucer's ``Canterbury Tales,'' the original manuscript of
Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol'' and Mary Shelley's own copy of the
first edition of ``Frankenstein.''

Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to come to Israel for talks
when he visits the Middle East later this month.
   ``I think it would be helpful for us, and I think it could be
helpful also for the Soviets,'' Shamir said in a joint interview
with The Associated Press and the German news agency DPA.
   The Israeli leader's statements represented a marked change from
hard-line statements earlier this year that warned of the dangers
of Soviet involvement in Middle East peace efforts.
   Shamir said Shevardnadze and Secretary of State George P. Shultz
had signaled their intentions to visit the Middle East in the
coming weeks although details had not been finalized.
   ``We know about some intentions of both of them to do something
about the unrest (in the Israeli-occupied territories), about peace
in our area, but we don't know details of their next steps,'' said
Shamir.
   He said he would respond favorably to a visit of a high-ranking
Soviet official such as Shevardnadze, adding: ``We would welcome
it, and we will be willing to talk with him.''
   Speaking Sunday in his office at the prime ministry, Shamir
stressed that Israel was the key to efforts aimed at rekindling a
peace process in the Middle East.
   Asked if the Soviets and Americans could work together on a
peace shuttle, Shamir said, ``I think first of all they have to
work with us. We are the most important partner in such an effort.''
   Shamir also said he wanted to discuss with Shevardadnze the
normalizing of relations, which were broken by Moscow after the
1967 Middle East war, as well as the emigration of Soviet Jews.
   ``For us, it's important to have an opportunity to present our
positions, our views about the necessity for the Soviet Union to
establish normal relations with Israel and also to try to convince
the Soviet Union to change its policy regarding Jewish
emigration,'' Shamir said.
   As a precondition for Soviet involvement in Middle East
peacemaking, Israel has demanded restoration of relations and free
immigration for the 380,000 Jews who Israel claims want to leave
the Soviet Union.
   On Thursday, Israel's Independence Day, Shamir and President
Reagan are to sign a new memorandum of understanding that calls for
strategic cooperation in political and military spheres.
   Shamir said the pact would affirm existing agreements and
stressed it was not an anti-Soviet agreement, adding: ``There is
not any new element in this memo, but it institutionalizes all the
existing agreements.''
   The 73-year-old Israeli premier defended Israel's use of force
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, saying it had reduced the
scope of the rioting in recent weeks.
   ``I think there is a certain improvement, and I hope it will go
on because I imagine that many Palestinian Arabs understand that
this way of violence will not help any cause,'' he said.
   Shamir said he was ``not ready'' to comment on statements by
Israeli sources that Israeli forces assassinated Khalil al-Wazir,
the PLO's head of military operations, who was killed in Tunis on
Saturday.
   The influence of the PLO and the refusal of moderate
Palestinians to speak with Israel were cited by Shamir as reasons
for a lack of a solution.
   ``One of the important reasons for the Palestinian tragedy since
the beginning of the century is their being exposed to influences
from outside,'' said Shamir.
   He said it was his belief that the 1.5 million Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip were ``not yet ripe'' to handle their
own affairs and deal directly with Israel.
   ``They've always relied more on Arab factors from outside and
when there was a local leadership, it was always an extreme,
violent minority, and this situation still exists,'' he said.
   Shamir said he believed the future of the occupied territories,
which were captured from Jordan and Egypt in 1967, would be ``one
of the main subjects'' in Israel's November general elections.
   He indicated elections may again result in a national unity
government, a coalition like the one that has shared power since
the 1984 balloting ended in stalemate.
   Even though Shamir's right-wing Likud Bloc and Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres' center-left Labor Party have fought frequently,
Shamir said a large part of the populace favored such a coalition.
   ``I hope that if such a situation will arise, we will find ways
to make it better than this time,'' he said.

   A self-educated janitor who wore his
lawyer's hand-me-downs and lived frugally while investing in the
stock market has left at least $600,000 to the college where he
mopped floors for 30 years.
   Lawrence R. Hummel, who died March 22 at age 82, had amassed $1
million with investment knowledge gleaned in part from discussions
with professors and from economics classes he audited at Bethany
College.
   ``If you saw him and talked with him, noticed his demeanor and
the way he dressed, you might confuse him with, the only word thing
I can think of is, a bum,'' said his lawyer, Joseph Gompers of
Wheeling.
   ``But he wasn't. He was a warm, compassionate person who cared
about people. I would give him some of my old clothes to wear. If I
didn't, I know he would never buy any for himself.''
   Hummel lived frugally, investing money from the sale of his
share of the family dairy farm in 1953 to his late brother, George,
along with wages from the private, 800-student college in northern
West Virginia. He worked at Bethany from 1953 to 1983.
   ``He knew the stock market inside and out. He was always at the
college library reading The Wall Street Journal to follow the stock
market,'' said Gompers.
   The college will receive an initial $600,000 from the estate,
Gompers said. A trust fund for a disabled nephew will get $400,000,
the balance of which will revert to the college on the nephew's
death. A niece and two other nephews each received $2,000.
   ``I never imagined he had that kind of money,'' said Forrest H.
Kirkpatrick, dean of the faculty.
   ``I taught economics and business at Bethany for many years and
Larry Hummel would be sitting and waiting for my car to arrive and
he wanted to talk about stocks,'' Kirkpatrick said. ``He asked me
general questions and I had no idea how much he was investing. I
have no idea what his stock portfolio is either.''
   Hummel sat in on every lecture that Perry Gresham, former
Bethany president, gave on economics. He often asked Gresham about
investments and asked what things at the college were worthy of
support.
   What Gresham best remembers about Hummel is how hard he worked.
``It was past time to quit many times when I saw him,'' Gresham
said. ``It would sometimes be dark and he would still be working.''
   Hummel had lived at home on the family farm until 1953, a year
after his mother's death. Strained relations with his brother led
him to sell out. He never married.
   He lived above a garage where he kept old lawnmowers for parts
to rebuild other mowers. He would spend money only when necessary.
   Associates said not much distracted him from his work, except
mention of one particular former president.
   ``It was common knowledge that the way to get Larry really
involved in a conversation, or to start an argument with him, was
to mention former President Franklin Roosevelt,'' said Ted W.
Brunnell, Bethany's director of financial aid. ``He had no use for
FDR's `New Deal.'''
   ``He despised Roosevelt,'' Gompers said. ``He didn't like the
idea of somebody being able to get something without working for
it.''

<HEAD>Disaster Medical System to be Tested This Weekend</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Defense Department said Tuesday it will
join other federal and local agencies in conducting a major test of
the National Disaster Medical System this weekend.
   The system, established in 1984, is designed to ensure medical
care for Americans injured in the course of a natural disaster or
war when local hospitals become filled.
   On the federal side, the system includes elements of the Defense
Department, Department of Health and Human Services, Veterans
Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   The exercise, conducted under the code name ``April Touchdown
'88,'' assumes that multiple tornadoes had touched down in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area of Texas.
   ``A major sports stadium, filled to capacity, is among the
buildings destroyed and 20,000 spectators are injured,'' the
Pentagon said of the scenario.
   The Defense Department will be responsible for air evacuation,
medical regulating activities and distribution of patients to
military and VA hospitals in Texas, Oklahoma,nation's ability to move injured
personnel quickly and effectively,'' a Pentagon statement said.
``Other goals include improving ground and air communication,
refining patient receiving procedures and ensuring that patients
can be tracked from one location to another.''

<HEAD>Four Entertainers Confined to `Hospital to the Stars'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rocker Eddie Van Halen, actor James Garner,
comic Sid Caesar and ex-TV star Morey Amsterdam were confined to
beds Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, frequently called the
``hospital to the stars.''
   None was suffering from life-threatening ailments.
   Garner, 60, and Van Halen, 33, entered the hospital on Monday,
while Caesar, 66, and Amsterdam, 76, have been hospitalized several
days, said Ron Wise, spokesman at Cedars-Sinai.
   Van Halen had recently returned from Fiji when he was stricken
by a tropical virus, said his publicist Elliot Sekular.
   Van Halen is expected to be released within two or three days
for rehearsals of ``Van Halen's Monsters of Rock Tour,'' which
begins in late May, said Sekular.
   Amsterdam, best known as Buddy on ``The Dick Van Dyke Show,''
had blood clots removed from each leg and is ``doing very well,''
said Wise. It wasn't known when Amsterdam would be released.
   Caesar, who had hernia surgery two weeks ago, was being treated
for a staph infection, the spokesman said. ``He's doing quite well
and should be in the medical center through rest of the week,''
said Wise.
   Garner was undergoing a series of tests prior to surgery
Thursday on his aorta, which carries blood away from the heart.
   ``It's major surgery and they are going to operate and take care
of it,'' Garner's assistant, Maryann Rea, said.

<HEAD>House Votes Symbolic Approval of INF Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted 393-7 on Tuesday to place its
symbolic stamp of approval on the new treaty banning medium-range
nuclear weapons worldwide.
   The action has no practical effect since the Senate has
exclusive rights to consent to the ratification of treaties.
   But it does put the House on record as overwhelmingly endorsing
the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty shortly before the
Senate opens debate on the agreement.
   The resolution voicing support of the treaty, which was
concluded by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in Washington last December, also made a series of
non-binding policy statements in which the House:
   _Declared that the president should continue to provide a
credible nuclear deterrent force, including maintaining nuclear
weapons in Europe to help ensure the security of the NATO alliance.
   _Called on the president to provide leadership to strengthen
NATO's conventional forces and modernize the alliance's nuclear
deterrent forces in Europe.
   _Urged the administration to seek verifiable conventional arms
agreements resulting in Warsaw Pact arms reductions in those areas
where pact forces have superior strength.
   _Called for the creation of a comprehensive arms control
strategy.
   _Endorsed the Reagan administration's effort to negotiate with
the Soviet Union effectively verifiable reductions in strategic,
intercontinental nuclear forces.
   _Declared the president should act appropriately to deal with
any Soviet violations of the new INF treaty, including withdrawing
from it if the violations are serious.
   _Called on the president to propose ways of resolving existing
alleged Soviet arms control violations ``and to address any future
Soviet arms control violations in a decisive manner.''
   The INF treaty requires the destruction of all U.S. and Soviet
missiles with a range of between 300 miles and 3,400 miles. It bans
flight tests of any missiles within that range. And it provides for
on-site inspection to verify compliance. Most such weapons are
deployed in Europe but the treaty imposes a worldwide ban.
   The House resolution stated that the treaty sets an important
precedent by requiring the Soviets to destroy more weapons than the
United States in order to eliminate all such medium-range missiles.
   It applauded verification requirements as being ``extremely
stringent.''
   ``The INF Treaty vindicates the importance of NATO security
cooperation and illustrates the ability of the members in NATO to
act in concert to accomplish meaningful reductions in Soviet
nuclear arms,'' the resolution declared.
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., one of the few House members to speak
against the treaty, said it should be rejected because the Soviets
can cover European targets with long-range weapons, and because, he
contended, Moscow is certain to cheat.
   ``The Soviet Union sucks us into agreements and later violates
them,'' Burton asserted. ``This is another tragic mistake.''

   A French warship spotted three mines and
Iranian spe Navy vessels.
   A marine executive said the gulf appeared ``ghostly'' from lack
of shipping. He and others said commercial vessels were avoiding
the waterway, where Iran and Iraq have been at war since September
1980 and the U.S. Navy sank or damaged six Iranian vessels Monday.
   They also said the United States had suspended escorts of
Kuwaiti oil tankers temporarily, but Defense Department spokesman
Dan Howard denied it. The United States gave American flags and
registration to 11 Kuwaiti tankers last year and the Navy escorts
them through the gulf.
   President Reagan said things were quieter in the gulf Tuesday
and ``we hope it continues that way.''
   Iran claimed its speedboats in the southern gulf sank an
``American naval logistical ship,'' killing its crew, an hour after
Navy ships destroyed two Iranian oil platforms Monday.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency headlined the dispatch
``Yankees Go Down To Watery Grave As Revolutionary Guards Sink U.S.
Ship,'' but it contained no details.
   At the Defense Department in Washington, Howard said of the
claim: ``No report has reached us from our forces in the Gulf of
any hostile acts (against them) today.''
   After the confrontation Monday, the Pentagon said there were no
confirmed U.S. casualties but a search was being conducted for an
missing AH-1 helicopter with two crewmen aboard. Iran claimed to
have shot it down.
   At the United Nations in New York, Iran lodged a formal
complaint Tuesday about attacks by the ``war-monger'' United
States. Washington responded that its actions had been ``necessary
and proportionate.''
   IRNA also said an American attack Monday on the patrol boat
Joshan killed 15 crew members and injured 29.
   In Monday's operations, U.S. Navy forces destroyed two offshore
Iranian oil platforms in the southern Gulf, then sank the Joshan,
disabled two frigates and sank or damaged three attack boats.
   Iran attacked neutral commercial ships after the raid on the
platform, which were in retaliation for a mine that damaged the
frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts last week and wounded 10 crewmen.
   Tehran radio said Tuesday the Swiss ambassador, who represents
American interests in Iran, was summoned to the Foreign Ministry
and ``given a written warning in regard to America's aggressive
attacks.'' It said the note ``emphasized that Iran will retaliate.''
   Shipping executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the French warship spotted three mines in an area of the central
gulf previously believed mine-free. No details were available.
   After midmorning distress signals from two tankers entering the
narrow Strait of Hormuz, the southern gateway to the gulf, owners
and agents advised their vessels to anchor just outside the gulf,
off Khor Fakkan, the executives said.
   They identified the two ships attacked as the Meltem, flying the
Bahamas flag, and the 12,215-ton Fal-5 from the United Arab
Emirates. No details about the Meltem were available, but they said
the Fal-5 was set ablaze and Omani coastguard boats rescued the
crew.
   Associated Press reporter Richard Pyle, in a report from
shipboard, said a five Iranian missiles were fired from shore
Monday at a three-ship ``surface action group.'' They were the
first such attacks reported on U.S. warships.
   The three Navy ships took evasive action and fired chaff into
the air, which confused the missiles' guidance systems and caused
them to miss.
   One missile crossed behind the ships and hit a distant oil
platform, which was not identified.
   Navy officers identified the missiles as Chinese-made Silkworms,
which are known to be based in and near the strait. The Pentagon
said, however, that it had not confirmed the missile type.
   Although the Pentagon denied it, sources close to the Kuwait Oil
Tanker Co. said the Navy was halting excorts of the 11 reflagged
tankers until further notice. No convoys had been reported under
way this week, and the Kuwaitis said they were suspended after the
Samuel B. Roberts hit the mine last week.
   According to the sources, the mine was in a main channel off the
Qatar Peninsula that leads to the northern gulf and a mine sweeping
operation must be completed before convoys resume.
   Pentagon officials said the AH-1 Cobra helicopter did not return
to the USS Wainwright on Monday after a ``routine reconnaissance
mission.''
   Howard, the Defense spokesman, said the search continued Tuesday
but the Marine Corps had formally changed the status of the two
crewmen to missing.
   He identified them as Capt. Stephan C. Leslie and Capt. Kenneth
W. Hill, assigned to Squadron HMLA-167 based at the New River,
N.C., Marine Corps Air Station.

   Public comments are being sought on how to
design the 1989 wheat program, the Agriculture Department said
Tuesday.
   One the biggest decisions will be whether to include an acreage
reduction program, or ARP, in next year's program. That involves
how much of a farmer's wheat base must be idled in order to qualify
for 1989 price supports and other program benefits.
   For the 1988 wheat crop, as an example, participating farmers
had to reduce plantings by 27.5 percent of their wheat base.
   The 1985 farm law requires USDA to announce the following year's
wheat ARP no later than June 1.
   Comments can be sent by May 16 to: Director, Commodity Analysis
Division, USDA-ASCS, Room 3741-S, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, D.C.

   Prayers and songs filled the air Tuesday
as thousands remembered the Jewish men and women who fought Nazi
Germany and died in the Warsaw ghetto 45 years ago.
   Late in the day, anti-Israeli Arab students marched to the main
monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and a PLO delegation laid a
wreath.
   The ceremony in which prayers, songs and flowers were offered in
memory of the dead took place at midday on the broad plaza in front
of the Ghetto Fighters Monument.
   At 4:30 p.m., about 25 Arab and African students arrived at the
same site carrying banners criticizing Israeli conduct in the
occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. They were
joined by a delegation from the Palestine Liberation Organization
diplomatic mission to Poland.
   As police looked on, the PLO group laid a wreath of white
lillies two yards from the wreath presented by the state of Israel.
   The wreath, draped with a colorful Arab scarf, said, ``From the
fallen in the Palestinian uprising to the heroes of the Warsaw
Ghetto Uprising.''
   Exactly 45 years ago Tuesday, heavily armed squadrons of Nazi
troops entered the walled Jewish quarter of Warsaw, bent on the
quick annihilation of the last 70,000 inhabitants. Instead, they
were routed by the starving, poorly armed residents, who started a
doomed three-week struggle.
   Before the main cerresenting
veterans groups, Jewish communities worldwide and Polish
organizations laid wreath after wreath of flowers at the foot of
the monument, a bold relief of armed fighters crouched together
facing their foes.
   The monument, near the city's heart, was the very first erected
in the destroyed left bank of Warsaw after the war.
   As a crowd of about 4,000 Poles and Israelis stood side by side
under the leaden sky, a cantor sang Kaddish, the Jewish song of
mourning. And Rabbi Isser Frankel of Tel Aviv prayed for the
victims of the ghetto and the Nazi Holocaust in Poland.
   Later, when the Polish officials and military honor guard
withdrew, Israelis in the crowd burst into singing of their
national anthem, Hatikvah (The Hope).
   Poland and Israel do not have full-fledged diplomatic relations.
   Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon, in Poland on a visit
considered private, addressed the crowd and expressed thanks to
Polish authorities for the ceremony.
   He also spoke of the Holocaust in which 6 million Jews were put
to death in World War II, 3 million of them Polish Jews.
   ``We have to remember, yes, but not a paralyzing memory,'' he
said in English. ``Not only remember the past, but we should derive
a new determination from that tragedy to continue living.''
   An assembly at Warsaw's Palace of Culture and Science took place
later in the day, with speeches marking the anniversary.
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski was absent from the main
ceremony, but met Tuesday with a delegation of the visiting Jewish
leaders.
   About 3,000 people from Israel and around the world have come to
Poland for the observances beginning April 14, fewer than the 4,500
originally expected.
   Jewish visitors to Poland objected five years ago when
Palestinian diplomats were allowed to lay flowers at the main
ceremony marking the 40th anniversary of the ghetto uprising.
   This year, Polish officials did not invite diplomats to take
part in the ceremony at the monument. But representatives of
several nations held private wreath-layings later in the day.
   The last diplomatic group was led by deputy chief of the PLO
mission in Warsaw, Shawki Al-Omari.
   Julius Spiegel of New York City watched the scene and said
afterward he had no objections to the wreath-laying.
   ``They have a right. I have no sympathy for terrorism, of
course, but I have some sympathy for the Palestinian people. I
think it was quite dignified,'' he said.
   The Polish state-run news agency PAP, meanwhile, distributed a
text of a letter from PLO Ambassador Abdullah Hijazi to Polish
officials likening Nazi fascism in World War II to Israeli
``fascism'' in the occupied West Bank.
   The letter expressed ``deepest respect for the fallen of the
Warsaw ghetto.''

   The body of Khalil al-Wazir, the PLO
military commander assassinated in Tunis last week, was met in
Syria on Tuesday by grieving relatives and competing factions of
the PLO.
   The PLO-chartered plane carrying the body of al-Wazir, his wife,
five children and PLO officials touched down at Damascus airport at
2:45 p.m.
   Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat was not
aboard the plane. Arafat saw the body off at Tunis airport in
Tunisia but stayed behind, apparently because of his feud with
President Hafez Assad of Syria.
   Al-Wazir, 52, also known as Abu Jihad, was killed Saturday by
armed commandos who burst into his home in suburban Tunis. The
funeral was set for Wednesday.
   Israeli sources have said Israeli security forces carried out
the attack but the Israeli government has refused to confirm this.
   The PLO and Tunisia have blamed Israel for the assassination.
Tunisia on Tuesday requested a special session of the United
Nations Security Council to condemn the slaying.
   Al-Wazir's mother, Fawzieh, hugged and kissed his wife, Intisar,
as she stepped from the plane. Al-Wazir's sick father could not
make it to the airport.
   Among those aboard the plane were five members of the PLO
Central Committee, all members of Fatah, the backbone of the PLO.
   Also aboard were members of the Marxist Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine and the Moscow-oriented Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine.
   The popular front and the democratic front are the main factions
making up the PLO after Fatah.
   Arafat and al-Wazir were expelled from Damascus in June 1983
after a Syrian-backed mutiny in PLO ranks.
   Al-Wazir was born in Ramle, which is now in Israel, and had
asked to be buried close to Palestine. His mother and father live
in Damascus.
   Palestinian delegations at the airport rushed to embrace the PLO
officials as they stepped from the plane. George Habash, who leads
the popular front, took Mrs. al-Wazir in his arms.
   Mrs. al-Wazir, wearing a black dress and a Palestinian flag
scarf, emerged from the plane carrying a poster of her husband in
one hand and flashing ``V'' for victory in the other.
   ``In soul, in blood we shall continue the march to Palestine,''
vowed Mrs. al-Wazir, flanked by her children, all wearing olive
green military fatigues.
   About 30 Palestinian girl and boy scouts, some clad in PLO flags
and others in traditional Palestinian costumes, repeated Mrs.
Wazir's words, adding: ``There is no God but God. God loved Abu
Jihad.''
   The boy scouts, standing near the plane and carrying four
wreaths including one from Arafat, sang Palestinian revolutionary
songs. Al-Wazir's 21-year-old son, Bassil, vowed to avenge the loss
of his father.
   ``My father's martyrdom means a new beginning, a new start,
readiness and will to fight for the freedom of Palestine,'' Bassil
told reporters in English.
   Representatives of Assad's government and the Jordanian
government of King Hussein also were at the airport.
   Dozens of Palestinian men carried al-Wazir's coffin, draped in a
red, white, green and black Palestinian flag, out of the plane into
a waiting ambulance an hour after its arrival.
   A Tunisian commission investigating the assassination has
concluded that the operation was conducted by Israel commandos.
   The Tunisian ambassador to Washington said Tuesday the most
conclusive piece of evidence was the presence of a Boeing 707
aircraft with Israeli markings off the Tunisian coast at the time

   Michael Jackson pranced, danced and rocked at an
age when most kids are still molding Play Doh. An international
star and millionaire by adolescence, his life has remained
shrouded. His new autobiography, ``Moonwalk,'' hopes to rip through
that cloak.
   It doesn't. What we have here is a failure to titillate.
   The 283-page book, to be released this week by Doubleday, does
not name lovers, explain the megastar's affection for the Elephant
Man, detail massive plastic surgery and skin whitening, talk about
the oxygen pressure chamber he purportedly wanted to prolong his
life, or serve up any other delicious show biz dish.
   Rather, ``Moonwalk'' is a gentle excursion into the 24 years
Jackson has spent as a performer. The title refers to the sliding
dance step he popularized.
   ``I was interested in being able to talk about how I feel in a
book that would be mine _ my words and my voice,'' the 29-year-old
star says. ``I hope it will clear up some misconceptions.''
   Misconceptions are as plentiful in Jackson's life as screaming
teen-agers at his concerts. The media, it seems, has not been kind
to little Michael.
   ``I don't understand why they feel the need to make up things
about me,'' he writes. ``I take some small pride in thinking that
I've come out pretty well, all things considered. ... It's a
difficult life. Very few manage any semblance of a normal
childhood.''
   He admits to having two nose jobs and a chin cleft. However, he
said he has not had his cheeks or eyes altered or a skin peel.
   He acknowledges long-standing friendships with Tatum O'Neal,
Brooke Shields, Liza Minnelli, Elizabeth Taylor and Diana Ross _
but there is no kiss and tell.
   The closest he gets is a passage about a date with O'Neal. They
went to a club in Los Angeles called On the Rox, and the young
actress grabbed his hand.
   ``This probably wouldn't mean a lot to other people, but it was
serious stuff to me. She touched me,'' he says in the book.
   Jackson was asked to do the book in 1984 by two Doubleday
editors _ Jacqueline Onassis, who wrote the dedication page, and
Shaye Areheart, who worked closely with the reclusive star and
helped him write.
   ``He was someone we admired and thought was a real musical
genius, and he had had a long and fascinating career, considering
his age,'' Areheart said in an interview. ``I think the book
reflects the Michael Jackson I've come to know. He's very
sensitive, very loyal, very kind.
   ``He's every inch a professional; he's that way in every aspect
of his life. He's very articulate, very intelligent, very creative,
very lovely.''
   Areheart, who has been a Doubleday editor for nine years, said
both she and Jackson were satisfied with the result.
   ``I didn't put any pressure on him about subjects he wanted to
discuss in the book,'' she said. ``I wanted him to write a book
that reflected things he wanted to share with people. I thought he
was amazingly candid and warm and did an excellent job.''
   Jackson's honesty is illuminated in his feelings about his
loneliness, his family, how his career was managed and his missed
childhood.
   He started performing when he was 5 and recalled coming home
from school, dropping his books, going to the studio, returning
home around midnight and sometimes never even having time for a
snack. There was a park across the street from the Motown studio,
and he used to watch other youngsters at play.
   ``I'd just stare at them in wonder _ I couldn't imagine such
freedom, such a carefree life _ and wish more than anything that I
had that kind of freedom, that I could walk away and be like them.
So there were sad moments in my childhood,'' he said.
   Michael Jackson is the seventh of nine children born to Joseph
and Katherine Jackson in Gary, Ind. He performed as lead singer
with his older brothers as the Jackson 5. They released 26 albums
for Motown and Epic.
   Their father, a steel mill worker who played with a local rhythm
and blues band, was extremely strict with the young performers.
   ``We'd perform for him and he'd critique us,'' Jackson writes.
``If you messed up, you got hit, sometimes with a belt, sometimes
with a switch. ... Dad would make me so mad and hurt that I'd try
to get back at him and get beaten all the more.''
   When he turned 21, his father's management contract expired, and
Michael, dissatisfied with how his career was going, especially
with Motown's refusal to allow the Jacksons to write and produce,
fired him.

<HEAD>Meese Says He was Unaware of Benders' Involvement In Lease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said Tuesday
he didn't know until last week that the real estate family
contributing money for his wife's salary was leasing office space
to the Justice Department.
   In his first comments to reporters on the subject, Meese said
``there's absolutely no connection'' between his wife's
$40,000-a-year salary donated to a charity by the Bender family
foundation and a subsequent $50 million Justice Department lease
with a partnership headed by Howard M. Bender.
   Meese also said that as attorney general he ``never participated
in any matter pertaining to the Benders.''
   After meeting with several Republican congressmen on Capitol
Hill to discuss his trip earlier this month to South America, Meese
was asked whether it would have been better not to accept money
that was coming from a family that was renting offices to the
Justice Department.
   ``I think at the time nobody knew that they (the Benders) were
renting buildings to the Justice Department,'' he replied. ``As a
matter of fact, I didn't know that until I saw it in the news media
last week.''
   The Associated Press reported last Wednesday that a partnership
headed by Bender won a $50 million lease renewal on a Justice
Department building housing offices of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, a Justice Department agency.
   Thirteen days after obtaining the new lease, real estate
developer Bender and his partners sold the building for $22.6
million more than they had paid for it two years earlier, earning a
60 percent profit.
   ``Let me just say there's absolutely no connection between the
two things (his wife's salary and the Bender's business with the
Justice Department) and I think that will be made plain ultimately
when all the facts are out,'' Meese said.
   The attorney general was referring to the criminal investigation
of his activities being conducted by independent counsel James
McKay.
   McKay is looking into the involvement of longtime Meese friend
E. Robert Wallach in Ursula Meese taking her position with the
Multiple Sclerosis Society, to which the Bender Foundation
contributed the money constituting her salary.
   Wallach's attorney, George Walker, has told The Washington Post
that Wallach played a ``peripheral'' role in Mrs. Meese taking the
job at the MS Society.
   Wallach's ties to Meese and Wallach's and Meese's involvement
with scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. triggered McKay's probe of the
attorney general last May 11.
   Since then, the investigation has spread to Mrs. Meese's job and
Meese's actions on behalf of a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline
project in which Wallach was acting as a lawyer for one of the
partners.
   In addition, McKay has been delving into Meese's ownership of
$14,000 in regional Bell telephone company stock during a time when
as attorney general he was meeting with executives of the ``Baby
Bell'' companies.

<HEAD>About 1,000 Cubans Move Step Closer To Deportation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1,000 Cubans in federal custody have been
determined a risk to the community by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, bringing them one step closer to
deportation, officials said.
   The INS will begin informing the prisoners this week that they
are considered ``non-releasable,'' Duke Austin, an INS spokesman in
Washington, said Monday.
   The agency's action follows an agreement last year between the
government and rioting Cuban prisoners in Atlanta, which called for
a review of the cases of 3,800 Cubans in detention at the time.
   But in Miami, a lawyer who was present at the signing of the
agreement complained that prisoners were not allowed to present
evidence or witnesses during the INS review.
   ``It's a paper review. It's a joke,'' said Rafael Penalver. The
prisoners also will not get hearings during the appeal process, he
added.
   The prisoners, who came to the United States in the 1980
boatlift from the Cuban port of Mariel, had committed crimes in
this country and served out their prison terms before the INS
detained them indefinitely.
   In addition to the 1,000 judged non-releasable, about 2,100 of
the detainees have been released or approved for release, INS
officials said. The rest still are being reviewed.
   Once they get their notices, the prisoners have 30 days to
appeal to the INS. If that fails, they can appeal to a special
Justice Department panel.
   Anyone failing both appeals can remain in detention
indefinitely. But many of the non-releasable detainees also will
receive deportation notices, said Justice Department spokesman
Patrick Korten. The deportation process includes two further
chances at appeal.
   ``I think this is due process, and then some,'' Korten said.
   Korten would not say when deportation notices would be sent, or
how long the appeals could take.
   The prisoners rioted last fall, days after the State Department
announced on Nov. 20 that an immigration pact with Cuba had been
renewed.
   Under the accord, up to 20,000 Cubans could come to the United
States each year as immigrants and up to 3,000 more could arrive as
refugees. Cuba, in turn, agreed to take back at least 2,545 Mariel
felons in INS custody.
   The news sparked riots at prisons in Atlanta and in Oakdale, La.
Many of the detainees had spent years in INS detention and expected
to be released under an INS review that started last June.

<HEAD>Head of Securities Group Concerned About Lack of Market
Cooperation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the securities industry's largest
trade group told Congress on Tuesday that despite progress in some
areas, he remains very concerned by lack of cooperation between
stock and futures exchanges.
   ``My deep concern is that things are moving so slowly in coming
up with the coordination between the various major markets,'' said
John W. Bachmann, chairman of the Securities Industry Association.
   New York Stock Exchange Chairman John J. Phelan and Chicago
Mercantile Exchange Chairman Leo Melamed told Congress last week
that they likely were within 30 days of reaching an agreement on
coordinating market halts when stocks or stock futures rise or fall
too sharply.
   But Bachmann, who is chief executive officer of Edward D. Jones
& Co., a St. Louis brokerage firm, told the Senate Banking
Committee that the pace of reform by the exchanges has been
``painfully slow.''
   ``Exchanges, while they're quasi-public institutions, are still
very much like businesses and competitive advantage is very
important,'' he said. Thus, they are ``torn between loyalties''
when considering measures to prevent another stock market crash.
   Bachmann said he finds market halts ``very distasteful,'' but
the ``lesser of two evils'' when compared with ``the destruction of
our markets.'' John M. Damgard, president of the Futures Industry
Association, the trade group for futures brokers, said he favors
``natural trading halts'' such as price limits.
   However, stocks and futures industries remain split over the
level of margins, the amount of money needed to control an
investment. The Securities and Exchange Commission is pushing for
higher futures margins, while the futures exchanges say their
margins, raised after the crash, are now high enough.
   Bachmann advocated the creation of a new panel of senior
exchange officials, which, under the oversight of the SEC, would
attempt to resolve such policy disagreements.
   Bachmann opposed a proposal by Senate Banking Committee Chairman
William Proxmire, D-Wis., that would create a supercommittee of
federal regulatory agencies to decide policy conflicts by majority
vote.
   Instead, he backed the SEC's bid for authority over stock
futures, which currently rests with the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. Authority over futures margins should go to the Federal
Reserve Board, which already sets stock margins, Bachmann said.
   Damgard also opposed Proxmire's proposal, which was introduced
last month with the support of Nicholas Brady, a Wall Street
investment banker and former senator who headed a presidential task
force that studied the crash.
   Damgard said it would be inappropriate for independent
regulatory agencies to be forced to bend to the wishes of other
regulatory agencies.
   He recommended that Congress refrain from tinkering with the
current division of regulatory turf but said more cooperation could
be fostered by continuing a White House working group, which is
planning to report its recommendations next month.
   Damgard said such a group would allow agencies to bring ``subtle
pressures on one another without making one party knuckle under.''
He also said futures margins are best set by the individual
exchanges.
   However, Proxmire told Damgard: ``It seems to me what you're
calling for is, if not chaotic, at least indecisive.''

<HEAD>Milwaukee Swears In New Mayor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Milwaukee swore in its first new mayor in 28
years Tuesday as John O. Norquist took over from the retiring Henry
Maier and pledged ``to shake things up a little.''
   Norquist, who was elected April 5 by a comfortable margin, took
the oath of office and replaced the longest serving big-city mayor
in the country.
   ``After 28 years of leadership from Mayor Henry Maier, Milwaukee
is prepared to build on his accomplishments _ and to improve upon
them where we can,'' Norquist said in his inaugural address at City
Hall before about 200 city and state officials and supporters.
   Maier, 70, a past president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and
National League of Cities, announced last year he would not seek
re-election because of his age.
   After Norquist was sworn in, Maier wished his successor good
luck. ``I know you have the courage and vision to do the job,''
Maier said.
   Norquist, 38, whose campaign themes stressed the need for
change, said he planned to seek broader cabinet-government powers.
One proposal would allow the mayor to hire and fire certain city
officials who now have set terms of office.
   Norquist also immediately replaced five Maier appointees on the
Metropolitan Sewerage Commission and called for the panel to fight
water pollution.
   But one of Norquist's biggest challenges will be grappling with
lingering racial divisions in the inner city, where blacks suffer
from high rates of unemployment and welfare.
   ``Milwaukee has always been proud of its racial and ethnic
diversity,'' he said. ``But not all racial and ethnic minorities
have shared equally in our progress.
   ``City government can be and must be a leader in breaking down
the barriers of discrimination and bringing this city together.''
   Norquist pledged to open city government to minorities, and of
his 12 staff appointments, three are black and one is Hispanic.
   Norquist also said creating jobs would be a top priority.
   ``All of the economic development tools and resources at our
disposal will be targeted toward creating jobs and keeping them
here in Milwaukee,'' he said.
   Norquist said he planned to alter the structure of city
government to cut expenses and hold down property taxes.
   ``I said many times during this campaign that Milwaukee is at a
crossroads,'' he said. ``Which path we take will determine whether
Milwaukee takes its place as one of America's truly great cities in
the 1990s, or whether it settles for second-class status.''

<HEAD>Persian Gulf Clash Largest Yet in U.S. Bid To End Tanker Attacks</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Gulf Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Monday's naval battle in the Persian Gulf
marked the most heated conflict in the U.S. effort aimed ostensibly
at calming the ``tanker war'' between Iran and Iraq.
   The U.S. intervention nearly a year ago came when many
administration analysts believed Iraq was in danger of losing the
war it began with Iran in September 1980, a fear that has faded.
   The naval engagements on Monday coincided with claims by Iraq
that it had retaken the Faw Peninsula, which it lost in 1986 in
what many observers considered to be Iran's major victory in the
Iran-Iraq war.
   Iran on Tuesday denied it had lost Faw, but noisily claimed that
U.S. helicopters had flown air support for Iraqi troops, allowing
it to blame ``the Great Satan'' for what could prove to be a major
Iranian defeat in the ground war.
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard denied that U.S. forces flew in
support of Iraqi troops. He and other administration officials
portrayed the naval engagements on Monday as a kick in the teeth
that they hoped would keep Iranian ships, speedboats and mines out
of the gulf.
   In the wake of the fighting Monday, the two-man crew of a U.S.
helicopter was missing and an unknown number of Iranians were dead.
That was thought to be the most casualties in the tanker war since
an Iraqi warplane mistakenly fired on the USS Stark, killing 37
American sailors on May 17, 1987.
   Many members of Congress expressed support for the latest U.S.
actions. But the fighting renewed talk on Capitol Hill of invoking
the War Powers Resolution, under which Congress would have 60 days,
or at most 90 days, to approve the deployment of U.S. forces in a
war zone.
   The Reagan administration fended off congressional efforts to
invoke the War Powers resolution last year, but in doing so sent
mixed signals about why it had agreed in the winter of 1986-87 to
reflag 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers and provide them naval escorts in and
out of the gulf.
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., led criticism of the U.S. policy last spring, saying
``we have basically taken a strong tilt toward Iraq. That ought to
be debated on its own merit and not under the illusions that we are
protecting the free flow of oil.''
   Administration officials said the goal of the escorts was to
protect the flow of oil out of the gulf, but also acknowledged they
wanted to restore U.S. credibility among the Arabs following
disclosures that Washington had sold arms to Iran.
   An Iranian victory in the war, they said, would endanger Arab
states along the gulf, a fear that was reinforced by riots by
Iranians pilgrims to Mecca on July 31.
   And administration officials said they met the Kuwaiti request
for protection in order to prevent the Soviet Union from providing
the escorts and thereby increasing Kremlin influence in the region.
   The U.S. effort soon became a contest of wills between the
Reagan administration and the regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, and the Iranians appeared at times to have the upper hand.
   The escorts actually began last July 22, as four U.S. warships
sailed with two U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers, the Gas Prince and
the Bridgeton.
   As the convoy neared an oil loading terminal in Kuwait, a mine
explosion rocked the Bridgeton, a 400,000-ton supertanker.
   The U.S. warships crept the remainder of the way in the wake of
the Bridgeton, which one American Navy officer likened to a ``deep
draft mine sweeper.''
   Iran called the debacle ``an irreparable blow to American
military and political prestige,'' and said the mine had been laid
by ``invisible hands.''
   Although Iran for the most part avoided attacking U.S. vessels
directly, its mines and speedboats continued to plague gulf
shipping. Then, on Oct. 15, an Iranian Silkworm missile fired from
Faw struck a U.S.-owned vessel, the Sungari, and the next day
another Silkworm hit a reflagged Kuwaiti tanker, the Sea Isle City,
blinding its American captain, John Hunt.
   On Oct. 19, the United States struck back. Four U.S. warships
fired 1,065 rounds from five-inch guns at an Iranian oil rig,
destroying it.
   Iran, then still winning the ground war, refrained from a direct
response.
   But over the winter, Iran failed to launch its annual Kerbala
offensive along the southern front, and there were reports that the
Khomeini regime was having trouble finding ``martyrs'' to fill the
ranks.
   Then Iraq launched its surprise offensive to retake Faw.
Confronted with defeat on land, Iran responded with force to the
new American attack on oil platforms in the gulf _ an attack very
similar to the one Iran ignored last October.
   U.S. vigilance had tightened since the attack on the Stark 11
months beforehand, and the apparent American military success
seemed likely to fend off any moved in Congress recall the 25 to 30
U.S. naval vessels in and around the gulf.

<HEAD>Habitat To Build 20 Atlanta Homes In Largest Project To Date</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Habitat for Humanity announced Tuesday it will
build 20 homes for Atlanta's working poor in a five-day crash
project starting June 27, the 12-year-old volunteer agency's most
ambitious project.
   The effort, named the Jimmy Carter Work Project '88 after
Habitat's best-known volunteer, is intended ``to fill a void
between a market economy that does not reach down to some economic
classes and a government with other spending priorities,'' said
project director Bruce Gunter.
   Carter said Habitat ``arouses the conscience of the world to the
problem of the homeless'' and to the ``disgrace in our own rich
nation of the homeless situation.''
   The Americus-based Habitat has built more than 4,000 homes for
the working poor on a non-profit, no-interest basis since 1976 and
expects to complete 2,000 this year. It has chapters in 277
American cities and 26 other countries.
   Recipients of the homes, who have to help build them, pay back
the cost usually over 20 years with mortgages averaging $118 a
month. The money goes into a revolving fund used to build more
houses. Most of the labor is volunteer.
   The houses are wood-frame structures designed to be simple but
adequate with all of the basics and few frills.
   Habitat has built 24 homes in Atlanta since it started in the
city in 1983 and hopes to complete 75 by 1990. City figures show 31
percent of Atlanta's housing to be substandard, compared with a
nationwide average of 8 percent.
   ``Habitat is doing what the federal, state and local governments
should be doing,'' said Mayor Andrew Young, who also is active in
the Habitat organization. ``Habitat is showing us the way.''
   So far 10 families have been picked for the 20 homes to be built
in the $600,000 project.
   The first house has already been built to serve as the temporary
project office.
   After construction is over, Evelyn Jackson will move into the
three-bedroom house with her two children. The Oglethorpe
University housekeeper has lived all her life in the
down-at-the-edges southeast Atlanta neighborhood where the block of
homes will be built.
   ``This means I can keep my roots here,'' she said. `We helped
frame it up and insulate it.''
   ``There was a lot I didn't know and they showed me how,'' she
said. ``Now if something goes wrong maybe I can fix it myself.''
   Habitat also will build five row houses in Philadelphia starting
June 20 and has announced a 12-week, 1,200-mile march from
Portland, Maine, to Atlanta starting June 26 during which Habitat
volunteers plan to build 120 homes and collect $1.2 million in
donations to initiate more construction.

   A former English teacher is getting rave
reviews for mathematics textbooks with odd titles like
``Mathematics Through Sports'' and ``Mathematics Through Home
Management.''
   Gary Ellyson, who also used to be a coach, has written four
textbooks, and a fifth is on the way. So far, he has sold more than
1,600 books to a broad spectrum of educational institutions.
   The soon-to-be released ``Mathematics Through Sports'' reads
like a series of short stories, interrupted with sets of math
problems.
   ``People ask why something like this has never been done
before,'' said Ellyson. ``I tell them, `Because it's a heck of a
lot of work.'''
   Ellyson, 70, retired eight years ago from his post as
superintendent of the Weed Union School District, about 240 miles
north of San Francisco, and began writing.
   ``I figured if students saws the relevancy in the math, how it
is meaningful in their lives, they'd enjoy school and stay in
school,'' he said.
   A year ago, Ellyson and his wife, Lillian, mailed out 700
brochures describing the books. Response was so heavy they had to
get an answering machine.
   Now he has mailed out an additional 21,000 brochures and is
planning a Spanish version.

   Stone Container Corp. had a good year
last year, so good it decided to do a good turn for its workers _
and an electronics company.
   It bought 19-inch color television sets with remote control for
every one of its 21,000-plus employees at 150 plants in the
country. All of the sets were Zeniths.
   The company would not say how much it paid for them, but vice
president Bill Klaisle said they were worth $8 million to $10
million.
   ``It was the biggest order Zenith ever got,'' Klaisle said.
   Stone's revenues were up 59 percent to $3.2 billion last year,
and its earnings were up 355 percent to $161.3 million. The company
makes containerboard and corrugated containers, paper bags and
newsprint, among other things. Part of last year's success was
attributed to its acquisition of Southwest Forest Industries.
   The company's workers, including 223 at the Louisville plant,
heard the good news Monday from chairman Robert Stone, via
videotape from the company's Chicago office.

<HEAD>Protesters Take Over Tribal Headquarters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thirty protesters from the Minnesota
Chippewa Tribe occupied the lobby of tribal headquarters for a
second day Tuesday to protest a hunting and fishing rights
agreement between the tribe and the state.
   Protesters said they would stay until elected tribal officials
meet with them. They brought food, blankets and a television set
into the building, which also houses the local office of the U.S.
Bureau of Indian Affairs. The protesters were not barring entry to
the BIA offices.
   Tribal officials have told the protesters they would have to
wait until a regular tribal committee meeting April 28 in Grand
Portage to talk with tribal leaders.
   On Monday, tribal officials threatened to call police if the
protesters remained in the headquarters building after the 5 p.m.
closing time. But Cass County Sheriff Jim Dowson said Monday night,
``they haven't called and I'm not going to do anything about it
unless they're harming people.''
   No problems have been reported.
   The protesters have said their leaders reached agreement with
the state on hunting and fishing rights in northeastern Minnesota
without consulting the members. They also said the agreement,
approved by Legislature and signed by Gov. Rudy Perpich last week,
gives away their hunting and fishing rights for a fraction of their
worth.
   The agreement, the protesters argue, violates federal law by
interfering with the Treaty of 1854 between the United States and
the Anishinabe Nation, whose anglicized name is Chippewa.
   The agreement requires the Fond du Lac, Boise Fort and Grand
Portage Chippewa bands to abstain from exercising full hunting,
fishing and gathering rights reserved under the 1854 treaty.
   In exchange, the three bands would received $5 million annually.
   The agreement does not affect hunting and fishing on
reservations, but requires Indians to give up their rights under
the treaty to hunt and fish free of state restrictions on
non-reservation land.
   The area involved covers about 10,000 square miles among the
three tribes and reaches roughly from the Snake River, north to the
Canadian border near the mouth of the Vermillion River and east to
Lake Superior.

<HEAD>Pentagon Needs Better Ethics Oversight of Advisory Panels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department needs to improve its
compliance with a law designed to eliminate conflict of interest
questions about Pentagon advisers, the General Accounting Office
said Tuesday.
   The Pentagon ``is generally complying with'' the Federal
Advisory Committee Act, but ``some key steps still have not been
implemented and should be,'' said Rosslyn Kleeman of the
congressional watchdog agency.
   The testimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
centered on expert panels created to advise the Strategic Defense
Initiative Organization, the office created in 1983 to oversee
President Reagan's Star Wars anti-missile program.
   The SDIO was chosen for a review because it uses a large number
of expert committees. Throughout the government, there are more
than 1,000 advisory committees on a wide range of topics.
   Five years ago, the Pentagon was sharply criticized for lax
management of conflict-of-interest and ethical questions and the
SDIO advisory committees were created after that review.
   Although the Defense Department is doing a better job, it's
still not good enough, the GAO said.
   ``Specifically, the advisory committees need to document the
reasons why individuals were selected for advisory committees and
panels in order to demonstrate how they went about achieving the
balanced membership required in the act,'' Kleeman said.
   In addition, the GAO study said the committees need better
documentation of financial disclosure statements made by panel
members, and need a better review process to make sure ethical
questions are answered.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the panel, said the
Pentagon has taken steps to improve its oversight of the committees.
   But he added that the Pentagon's ``compliance ... remains open
to question'' with a requirement for documenting why people are
picked.
   David O. Cooke, deputy assistant secretary of defense for
administration, testified that the Pentagon has tried to improve
its oversight of the panels.
   ``Problems regarding the administration of DoD advisory
committees sometimes surface,'' he said. ``When they do, we address
them promptly.''
   William Carroll, general counsel for the SDIO, admitted that his
office had found ``a weakness in our internal management controls''
which delayed appointments of consultants.
   David Parnas, a computer scientist at Queen's University in
Ontario, Canada, testified that three years ago he was offered
$1,000 per day to serve on a panel advising the SDIO on computer
software. He said he was appointed despite the fact he told
Pentagon officials he already was a part-time employee of the Naval
Research Laboratory.

   A death camp survivor said Tuesday that the
conviction of John Demjanjuk for Nazi war crimes avenged millions
of Jews killed in the Holocaust, but Demjanjuk's family contended
he was the victim of biased judges.
   ``This verdict is revenge for all those who did not survive,'' a
jubilant Pinchas Epstein told Israel radio.
   Epstein had testified during the 14-month trial that he
recognized the retired U.S. autoworker as ``Ivan the Terrible,''
the nickname used by prisoners at Treblinka death camp for one of
their guards.
   Demjanjuk's son, John, condemned the verdict as ``ludicrously
sweeping'' and said it resulted from ``judges who lost their
impartiality.''
   ``Five, 10, 15 years from now, when people look back at this
trial, John Demjanjuk is going to be remembered as the victim,''
his son said.
   Israeli officials applauded the conviction Tuesday, and Justice
Minister Avraham Sharir called for the death penalty. Demjanjuk is
to be sentenced next Monday.
   Demjanjuk, of suburban Cleveland, was convicted of operating gas
chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at Treblinka in Nazi-occupied
Poland in 1942 and 1943. In a 450-page decision, the judges
rejected all defense arguments.
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk, 68, has maintained he is a victim
of mistaken identity who was a Nazi prisoner of war and was not at
Treblinka.
   Epstein, one of five survivors who identified Demjanjuk as
``Ivan the Terrible,'' left the courtroom in tears Monday when
judges described atrocities committed by the Nazi guard.
   Israel's prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir, praised the trial and
conviction. ``Every Jew feels a certain degree of satisfaction from
the conviction of Demjanjuk,'' the Polish-born Shamir told Israel
radio on Tuesday. His parents were killed in the Holocaust.
   Speaking from Paris, Justice Minister Sharir called for
Demjanjuk to be sentenced to death. ``A man convicted of such
terrible crimes deserves no other sentence,'' he told Israel radio.
   However, he has no authority over the state prosecutor, who will
argue the sentence at Monday's hearing.
   In a rare public comment, former Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
who also lost family in the Holocaust, lauded the legal proceedings.
   ``It was a just trial,'' Begin, who has lived in seclusion for
the past five years, told Israel radio. ``Thanks to the trial, the
younger Israeli generation learned about the fate of the Jews in
the Holocaust.''
   About 6 million Jews were put to death in the Holocaust.
   Zvi Terlow, who helped prosecute Adolf Eichmann, the only other
man tried in Israel for Nazi war crimes, said he was certain the
judges would not have convicted Demjanjuk if there were doubts
about his identity.
   ``No stone was left unturned, there was a mountain of
evidence,'' Terlow said.
   Eichmann, the architect of the Holocaust, was convicted and
hanged in 1962.
   Demjanjuk's son-in-law, Ed Nishnic, said the judges
automatically rejected defense arguments.
   ``It was as though the judges were sitting there with their ears
covered and their eyes closed during the defense side of the
case,'' he said.
   John Demjanjuk Jr. said: ``Judging by the way they conducted the
trial and totally disregarded our evidence in their verdict, we
don't expect anything less than the death penalty.''
   Demjanjuk's attorney, John Gill of Cleveland, said although he
had expected a guilty verdict at the emotionally charged trial,
``It totally surprised me that they (the judges) could be so
devastatingly sweeping.''
   Gill said he would argue against the death penalty on Monday and
planned to appeal to the Supreme Court.
   There is no minimum sentence but Demjanjuk is considered
unlikely to receive anything short of life imprisonment.

<HEAD>Large Soviet Grain Purchases Brighten U.S. Farm Prospects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial prospects for American farmers
continue to brighten, and one reason is a pickup in grain exports
this year, an Agriculture Department report said Tuesday.
   Large purchases by the Soviet Union, particularly wheat sold at
subsidized prices, have played an important role.
   Overall, the Soviet Union's total grain imports are at a
three-year high, despite bumper harvests the last two seasons, the
report said.
   ``The gain is primarily from larger wheat purchases,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said. ``Aided by the Export
Enhancement Program and Soviet demand for milling-quality wheat,
the U.S. share of import volume is likely to rise to about half
this year, up from less than 1 percent in 1985-86.''
   The Soviet Union is expected to import 32 million metric tons of
grain from all foreign sources in the international marketing year
that runs through June 30, 1988. That would be the most since
imports were a record 55.5 million tons in 1984-85.
   The wheat share of this year's imports is estimated at 22
million tons, the most since 1984-85 when wheat rose to 28.1
million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   Soviet wheat imports dropped sharply in 1985-86 to 15.7 million
tons, when the U.S. share declined to a trickle.
   Under a five-year agreement, the Soviet Union is committed to
buy at least 4 million tons of wheat and 4 million tons of corn
annually. The pact expires Sept. 30 and covers the year that began
last Oct. 1.
   Although the agreement year is three months out of step with the
July 1-June 30 marketing year, it does show a similar trend in
Soviet grain imports.
   For example, Soviet wheat purchases fell short of the pact's
minimum in 1984-85 when they dropped to 2.9 million tons, and in
1985-86 when they were only 200,000 tons. That coincided with the
``less than 1 percent'' U.S. share cited in the latest report.
   The Export Enhancement Progam allows exporters to sell
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices and
then collect free USDA-owned commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Subsidized wheat sales to the Soviet Union began a year ago. So
far Moscow has bought more than 8.8 million tons for delivery in
1987-88, the final year of the grain pact.
   In addition, the Soviets have bought 4.1 million tons of U.S.
corn, 818,400 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal
for delivery through Sept. 30.

<HEAD>Administration Fights Lawsuit By Polio Victim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan admnistration, supporting sweeping
legal immunity for the government, urged the Supreme Court on
Tuesday to kill a lawsuit in behalf of a boy who contracted polio
after receiving a dose of federally approved vaccine.
   Some justices reacted skeptically to arguments by Justice
Department lawyer Michael K. Kellogg, who said the government
should be shielded from paying damages.
   ``If you win, you might as well repeal the (Federal) Tort Claims
Act,'' Justice Byron R. White told Kellogg.
   The act permits the government to be sued in limited instances
when officials negligently cause personal injuries. The law does
not surrender government immunity for injuries resulting from an
official's ``discretionary function or duty.''
   Kellogg urged the court to protect the government from suit
``even if a specific (federal) employee is negligent'' _ and is not
exercising discretion.
   The court is expected to announce by July whether it will revive
a suit in behalf of polio victim Kevan Berkovitz, who was less than
three months old on May 10, 1979 when his pediatrician in
Charleroi, Pa., gave him a dose of Orimune.
   The drug, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories, is a form of
Sabin oral vaccine. Orimune was licensed by the government in 1963.
   Kevan was stricken with polio within a month and the U.S.
Communicable Disease Center determined he contracted the disease
from the vaccine. He is paralyzed and deformed and breathes with
the help of a respirator.
   Ms. Ellen M. Viakley, a lawyer representing the Berkovitz
family, urged the court Tuesday to revive the suit to allow the
family to prove that it may have been ``pure, sheer negligence'' by
government workers that caused the child's polio.
   She alleged that in licensing the vaccine, federal workers
approved it even though the number and size of lesions it caused
exceeded the government's standards. It was not a discretionary
decision by the government that the defective vaccine was safe, she
said.
   ``The allegation is that the numbers (of lesions) didn't add
up,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor later said to Kellogg, the
government lawyer.
   He did not dispute that interpretation. But Kellogg said even
when an employee is negligent, the government agency he works for
may be using its discretion in approving the vaccine.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the Berkovitz's
suit last year.
   The appeals court said the Food and Drug Administration is
exempt from the suit because the FDA exercised policy-making
authority _ in effect, its own discretion _ when it initially
decided to verify test results by vaccine manufacturers.
   The FDA's decision on how to go about testing the safety of
polio vaccine is a discretionary act that immunizes the government
from suit, the appeals court said.
   The administration has argued that if the government can be sued
in such cases, it will be forced into becoming an insurer of
vaccines and may withdraw from licensing them.
   Federal officials said Sabin oral vaccine, administered
routinely to all children in the United States, has all but
eliminated polio even though each year a few who take the vaccine
have adverse reactions.
   The case is Berkovitz vs. U.S., 87-498.

   An official at the U.S. Agency for

   Neboysha Brashich, AID's representative in Belize, approved more
than $100,000 in contracts for his wife, Prunella, to work at a
U.S. embassy and at AID from 1983 to 1987, according to a 10-count
federal grand jury indictment handed up in Alexandria, Va.
   Federal law prohibits a government officer or employee from
taking official action which affects the financial interest of a
spouse.
   Each count in the indictment carries a maximum penalty of two

   AID is a State Department agency that operates U.S. development
programs overseas, dispensing billions of dollars in non-military
foreign aid.
   Announcement of the indictment was made by Attorney General
Edwin Meese III.

<TEXT>
   More than 150,000 refugees fleeing a guerrilla
war and drought in Mozambique are likely to arrive in neighboring
Malawi over the next nine months, adding enormous strains to an
already-taxed relief effort, the State Department said Tuesday.
   Malawi currently provides haven for 450,000 Mozambican refugees,
but ``the population in Malawi is rapidly increasing and the most
conservative estimates forecast 600,000 refugees will arrive by
December 1988,'' according to a State Department report.
   The report said other African countries also are receiving large
numbers of refugees. There are 75,000 in Zimbabwe, 30,000 in
Zambia, 225,000 in South Africa, 72,000 in Tanzania and 20,000 in
Swaziland.
   Within Mozambique, there are 1.6 million displaced people, the
department said.
   ``Complicating the refugee situation is that Malawi has also
experienced a drought and a mealy bug infestation,'' the department
said. ``More than one million Malawians no longer have the
resources to feed themselves.''
   A consultant hired by the State Department to assess the
magnitude of the problem and recommend U.S. responses said he
interviewed a selected, geographically diverse sample of 200
refugees in camps between January and March.
   The consultant, at a background briefing arranged by the Bureau
of Refugee Programs, said 91 percent of those he interviewed
reported they Mozambique because of fighting between RENAMO, a
potent guerrilla movement, and the Maputo government. The war has
been going on since the mid-1970s.
   ``It reflects an intensity in the level of violence over the
period of the last year,'' the expert said. ``I think the drought
is an aggravating factor in increasing the refugee flows, but
according to the refugees with whom I spoke, the great majority
fled because of RENAMO related violence.''
   The State Department has pledged $4.4 million to a UN special
appeal for Mozambican refugees in Malawi. This is in addition to
$33.4 million contributed to the UN's program covering all of
Africa.

   More than 2,400 photographs from the
assassination of Robert Kennedy were unaccountably destroyed nearly
20 years ago, officials said Tuesday as they opened to the public
for the first time the long-secret police files.
   There was no explanation in the 50,000 pages of documents why
the pictures were burned or why such items as ceiling tiles and
door jambs from the scene of Kennedy's death were destroyed in the
months following the assassination.
   California Secretary of State March Fong Eu released the
documents, including interviews with 4,000 witnesses and 2,500
photographs from the Los Angeles Police Department files.
   The state's chief archivist said the documents were unlikely to
answer the numerous questions surrounding the 1968 assassination
because of the destroyed material.
   ``I've never seen a file quite this large,'' said archivist John
Burns. ``This is a very unusual murder file (but) I'm not
absolutely satisfied that any questions are answered.''
   He said the biggest surprise was the amount of evidence
destroyed, including the photographs, which were burned three
months after the assassintation. Their subjects are unknown.
   ``What I didn't know, and I'm told others didn't know, was that
so much evidence was destroyed,'' he said.
   He also said he could not explain why evidence was destroyed,
noting police were careful at the outset because they didn't want
``another Dallas,'' where Kennedy's brother, President John F.
Kennedy, was killed.
   Burns said he had not had time to examine all the evidence,
which he predicted will occupy researchers for years.
   The gaps in the material drew immediate criticism.
   ``Someone should ask the police why they destroyed 2,400
photographs in the most important case they've ever examined. ...
We didn't know about that until today,'' said Gregory Stone, a
political scientist at the University of Wisconsin and a longtime
student of the case.
   Among the persistent questions raised by conspiracy theorists
and scholars are: Was Sirhan Bishara Sirhan the only gunman? Was
Kennedy shot from in front or behind? Were there eight shots or
more in the pantry of the Ambassador Hotel? And how close was the
gunman whose bullet entered Kennedy's brain?
   Among the material put on display Tuesday was a polka dot dress,
bullets taken from victims and Sirhan's diary entry saying ``RFK
must die.''
   The dress was one of many purchased by police in an effort to
jog the memories of witnesses on a point of contention _ that a
girl in a polka dot dress seen running from the Ambassador Hotel
shouting ``We shot him.'' That report was never verified.
   The documents released include an admission by police that they
destroyed key evidence, including ceiling tiles, a door jamb and
thousands of photographs taken in the Ambassador Hotel kitchen
where Kennedy was shot on June 5, 1968.
   An official record in the evidence showed that 2,410 photographs
were burned on Aug. 21, 1968. It gives no reason.
   Also released was the police tape recording of a call reporting
the shooting. The caller did not immediately know who was shot but
told the officer who answered that Kennedy was in the hotel, to
which the unidentified officer replied: ``Big deal.'' When told
seconds later that Kennedy had been shot, the unidentified officer
asked for the address of one of the biggest hotels in Los Angeles.
   Extensive videotape and audio recordings graphically depict the
confusion at the scene. The videotape shows a fatally wounded
Kennedy, who moments before had declared victory in California's
Democratic presidential primary, lying on the floor, while
witnesses and other victims appear dazed.
   The shooting shooting occurred prior to Secret Service
protection for presidential candidates.
   One entire case of evidence contained items from Sirhan's
Pasadena home, including the diary in which Sirhan scrawled in
pencil his plans to kill the New York senator.
   ``My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more the more of
an unshakeable obsession,'' he wrote. ``RFK must die.''
   On the eve of the release of the files, Sirhan's attorney, Luke
McKissack, said Sirhan expects nothing to contradict his frequently
stated claim that he was a lone gunman.
   Witnesses told of seeing Sirhan step from behind a steam table
into Kennedy's path as the senator walked toward him. But Los
Angeles County Coroner Thomas Noguchi testified at Sirhan's 1969
trial that Kennedy was killed by a shot fired behind his right ear.
   Conspiracy theorists suggested that a second gunman fired at
Kennedy from behind while Sirhan stood in front.
   McKissack said that although Sirhan maintains he doesn't
remember shooting Kennedy, Sirhan, a Jordanian immigrant, believes
he was motivated by anger over the Arab loss in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war. He blames his memory loss on alcohol.
   McKissack said Sirhan, serving his life sentence at Soledad
Prison, has given up hope he will ever be paroled.
   The release of the records follows years of demands for public
access to the information.
   The only things withheld from disclosure, Eu said, were autopsy
photos, criminal ``rap sheets'' and fingerprint cards, juvenile
case records, internal police personnel records and records that
originated with the FBI or police departments outside Los Angeles.
   Burns said the FBI would release its own file at an unspecified
time.

   Israel deported eight more Palestinians from
the occupied lands to Lebanon on Tuesday, including six involved in
a stoning attack on teen-age Israeli hikers in a West Bank village,
the army said.
   In other developments, Ezer Weizman, a Cabinet minister without
portfolio, said the assassination of PLO military commander Khalil
al-Wazir last week may lead to more terrorism. The army censored a
newspaper editorial criticizing Israel's reported role in the
killing.
   Army officials said for the first time that the April 6 attack
on the hikers was planned. A teen-aged Jewish settler and two
Palestinians were killed.
   The officials said the planning was done by some of those in the
group of deportees, and described them as members of an outlawed
Palestine Liberation Organization youth group.
   An army spokesman said soldiers set up roadblocks to stop Arab
residents of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip from entering
Israel for two days beginning Tuesday night.
   He said the measure was aimed at preventing terror attacks on
Memorial Day, which began after nightfall Tuesday, and Independence
Day, which begins Wednesday night and marks the 40th anniversary of
the nation's birth.
   A Palestinian died Tuesday of wounds suffered the day before in
a clash with soldiers in the Pekoah, a West Bank village, an army
spokesman said.
   At least 168 Palestinians have been reported killed since riots
began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel has occupied
since capturing them from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
war. An Israeli soldier and civilian also have been slain.
   Curfews continued on 17 refugee camps and towns in the West Bank
and seven of eight refugee camps in Gaza. Major cities also
remained off limits to non-residents, including journalists.
   Hospital officials said a 16-year-old Palestinian was wounded
during clashes in Gaza City. The army reported relative calm
elsewhere.
   ``There is no doubt that the number of disturbances has declined
in the past three days,'' said an army spokeswoman, who attributed
it to the clampdown.
   Three Arabs have been killed since Saturday, when 15 died in
riots that began with the news that al-Wazir had been killed in
Tunis.
   Tuesday's deportations brought to 20 the number expelled since
the rebellion began. Six were from Beita, the West Bank village,
where residents stoned 16 teen-age Jewish hikers from a nearby
settlement and their two armed guards.
   A 15-year-old Israeli girl, Tirza Porat, and two Beita residents
were killed in the clash. An army report said Ms. Porat was killed
by a bullet fired from the weapon of one of the Israeli guards.
Initial reports said she had been stoned to death by Palestinians.
   Col. Raanan Gissin, deputy army spokesman, said one deportee,
Njjah Jamil Saada Daweikat, led the hikers into the village.
Previous reports said they followed after receiving promises of
protection.
   Daweikat admitted inciting another villager to attack an Israeli
youth, Gissin said. He added that another deportee, Mahmoud Adnan
Bani-Shamseh, took the gun away from one of the Israeli guards and
did not surrender it until he was arrested several days later.
   A military official who demanded anonymity said the six Beita
deportees were organizers in Shabibeh, an outlawed PLO youth group.
For more than a month, he claimed, the group had run Beita after
declaring it a ``liberated village.''
   ``They had planned an attack on hikers in advance. When this
group came from (the Jewish settlement of) Elon Moreh, the
opportunity presented itself. They had planned to take a group into
the village and hold them hostage,'' he said.
   The army bulldozed 14 houses of those who allegedly took part in
the stoning. One resident later was found to have tried to help the
settlers and the army promised compensation.
   According to the military official, those deported were planners
of attacks on civilians, not stone-throwers. ``They had planned it
beforehand,'' he said.
   Hanna Siniora, editor of the pro-PLO daily Al Fajr, predicted
expulsion would ``inflame the situation and actually add to the
determination of the Palestinian people in their struggle for their
national aspirations.''
   Elias Freij, mayor of Bethlehem, said it had been proven that
Ms. Porat died from a bullet fired by a Jewish guard and the
deportees were ``innocent victims of provocation by the Jewish
settlers.''
   The United States has condemned deportations, saying
international law bans transfer across borders of civilians living
in occupied zones.
   On Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
criticized the latest expulsions. Israel says only mass
deportations are illegal.
   Israeli sources say Israeli commandos shot and killed al-Wazir
at his home, but the nation's leaders have been silent on the
subject.
   NBC-TV reported the attack was approved at a Cabinet meeting
last week, with dissenting votes cast by Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres and Weizman, a former defense minister.
   Weizman declined to say if Israel was responsible but told
Israel radio the killing would lead to more terrorism. ``It
distances the peace process and will bring greater hostility and
make us more vulnerable around the world.''
   Israel's military censor took the unusual step of censoring an
entire editorial in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
   Newspaper sources said the editorial dealt with Israel's role in
al-Wazir's killing.

<HEAD>Iacocca Earned Nearly $18 Million In 1987, Union's Wrath</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>

   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca,
America's highest-paid executive in 1986, earned nearly $18 million
last year in salary, cash and stock bonuses and options, the
automaker reported Tuesday.
   Iacocca's earnings were part of the $85.2 million in
compensation that executives of the No. 3 automaker took home last
year.
   Chrysler released the figures the day after it opened early
contract talks with the United Auto Workers, and union Vice
President Mark Stepp blasted the earnings as ``an incredible
rip-off.''
   Stepp, who leads union negotiators in the talks, said in a
statement with UAW President Owen Bieber that the executives'
earnings ``blatantly contradict the message they try to send UAW
members in their factories and offices.''
   Iacocca's 1987 earnings of $17.9 million included nearly $13.5
million from exercising stock purchase options granted earlier in
the decade, when Chrysler was recovering from near ruin and its
stock was worth a fraction of its present value.
   Iacocca also received $765,890 in salary, $725,000 in cash
bonuses, $249,000 in stock bonuses and a stock grant worth nearly
$2.7 million when it was issued Dec. 8.
   The figures were contained in Chrysler's proxy statement, mailed
Tuesday to shareholders.
   In 1986, Iacocca took home $20.6 million, including $9.3 million
on exercised stock options. Proxy statements released and compiled
later in the year showed he was the nation's highest-paid executive.
   Chrysler's No. 2 executive, Gerald Greenwald, received nearly
$6.6 million in 1987, including $560,000 in salary and nearly $5.3
million from exercising stock options. Greenwald is chairman of
Chrysler Motors Corp., the company's automaking subsidiary.
   In all, Chrysler paid out $85.2 million to 2,035 executives in
1987: $77.9 million in cash, more than $1 million in stock bonuses
and nearly $6.3 million in retirement bonuses, Chrysler spokesman
John Guiniven said.
   Ford Motor Co. Vice Chairman Harold Poling was the No. 2 earner
among Big Three auto executives, receiving nearly $11 million:
$808,697 in salary, $2 million in cash bonuses and $8.1 million
earned exercising stock options.
   Roger B. Smith, chairman of General Motors Corp., topped GM's
earners last year with $2.2 million, including $867,000 in salary,
an estimated $800,000 in stock bonuses, $513,000 in stock options
and $56,000 from a savings plan.
   Executive earnings at Ford and GM were disclosed last week.
   In their statement, Steep and Bieber said the automakers
pressure workers to reduce costs to match Japanese auto companies,
but then justify ``stratospheric'' compensation for its executives.
   The union said top officers in Japanese companies earn about six
to eight times what their factory workers make. American executives
receive salaries that are 12 to 18 times their workers' pay, the
UAW said, and total earnings are hundreds of times what workers
receive when stock and cash bonuses are included.
   In 1987, Chrysler earned $1.29 billion, down 7.2 percent from
1986. Ford's earnings rose 40 percent last year to an
industry-record $4.6 billion. GM, the nation's largest automaker,
earned $3.6 billion in 1987, up 22 percent.
   Chrysler workers have no profit-sharing plan but are due to
receive one under their next contract, which will adopt a formula
established at GM and Ford last year.
   GM paid no profit-sharing for 1987 because it earned too little
on its U.S. auto operations to trigger payments. GM eliminated its
executive cash bonus plan in 1987 but gave out $184.6 million in
executive stock bonuses last year.
   Ford paid out a record $636 million in profit-sharing for 1987,
averaging $4,000 per worker. Ford also paid out a total of $247.9
million in 1987 cash bonuses to 5,166 executives.

   Israeli leaders privately expressed concern
about Jesse Jackson's rising popularity, but avoided saying
publicly whom they want to see in the White House next year to
avoid embarrassment after November elections.
   Political observers said Israel's favorite is Vice President
George Bush.
   ``Bush would likely be best because he is a known quantity,''
said political scientist Rafaela Bilsky of Jerusalem's Hebrew
University, adding that Democratic presidential hopeful Michael
Dukakis ``is an unknown.''
   She said Israeli leaders were not expected to voice their
preference. ``It's a matter of political wisdom, etiquette. If we
say who we'd like, then what happens if the other guy is elected?''
she said.
   In a recent interview, right-wing Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
refused to state his preference in the U.S. presidential race.
   All candidates have stated views on the Arab-Israeli conflict
that conflict with the position of Shamir, who opposes territorial
compromise with the Arabs.
   Asked about the views of the presidential contenders, Shamir
said: ``I would prefer to discuss this with the people in the
government.'' He declined to elaborate.
   Some Shamir associates, however, broke with tradition and
expressed apprehension about prospects that Jackson would run on
the Democratic ticket.
   ``We have fears because Mr. Jackson has said some very tough
things about Jews and voiced sympathy for the PLO (the Palestine
Liberation Organization),'' legislator Sarah Doron of Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc said in a telephone interview.
   Ms. Doron refused to say which candidate she favored.
   ``We prefer to refrain from interfering in the American
elections, just the same as I would expect any other country to
refrain from interfering in our politics,'' she said.
   The Israeli public has shown great interest in the U.S. campaign
and the local media have covered it extensively.
   Most commentaries focused on Jackson's popularity, debating what
it means to the Jewish state.
   The mass-circulation Maariv daily called on American Jews to
vote against the Democrats if Jackson was on the ticket.
   ``He has publicly embraced (PLO chief Yasser) Arafat. In many
years there has not been such a prominent political leader in the
United States who has shown such hostility toward Jews in general
and particularly toward Israel,'' the newspaper said in a recent
editorial.
   ``We hope that American Jews will draw the proper conclusions
about the party in which Jesse Jackson plays a key role.''
   An opinion column in the liberal Haaretz daily, however, urged
Israeli leaders to accept Jackson's status and open a dialogue with
him ``because he is one of the most influential leaders in the .. .
Democratic Party.''
   Most commentators agree the outcome of the November elections
will have little influence on U.S.-Israeli ties.
   ``It will only be a matter of whether things will be harder or
easier,'' Ms. Bilsky said.

<HEAD>Shenandoah Council Votes To Declare Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHENANDOAH, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This former coal-mining community has
taken the extraordinary step of filing for bankruptcy to get out
from under a $450,000 debt.
   While a standing-room-only crowd watched, the borough council
voted 5-2 Monday to file under Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy
law, which allows the community to hold off its creditors while it
works out a plan to pay its debts.
   Allen Dubroff, a lawyer handling the bankruptcy filing, said
that the municipality is not the first in the nation to seek
Chapter 9 protection but that the tactic is rare.
   Council President William Slezosky said the community of about
7,000 residents, more than 60 percent of them retired or on fixed
incomes, cannot dig itself out of debt without help.
   He blamed the borough's debts on the previous administration's
``sloppy'' business practices and unwillingness to raise taxes or
cut services while costs rose.
   Councilmen William Phillips and John Litwak voted against the
move.
   ``I don't relish bankruptcy,'' said Phillips. He said the
initial cost of filing is $25,000 and the lawyer's fee $195 an
hour. ``We're not gaining anything. All we are doing is taking
taxpayers' money and giving it to lawyers.''
   Phillips said he would prefer that the borough borrow $425,000
to pay off its bills and then adopt some belt-tightening measures.
But Slezosky said that require the borough to raise its real estate
tax 60 percent.
   ``One of the easiest things we could have done, and we could
have done it two months ago, was to borrow $425,000, but not come
out of this for 10 years,'' Slezosky said.
   A declaration of bankruptcy, if aproved by a federal bankruptcy
judge, would prevent the Internal Revenue Service from adding fines
and penalties to the $122,000 the borough owes in taxes withheld
from employees' paychecks.
   Slezosky said some of the paperwork for the reorganization plan,
such as a five-year tentative budget, already has been prepared.
   Representatives of the state Department of Community Affairs
said last week that filing for bankruptcy automatically will place
the borough under the agency's distressed communities program.
Slezosky said he hopes the bankruptcy action will qualify the
borough for state grants and no-interest loans available under that
program.
   The DCA is expected to place some restrictions on how the
borough spends money and levies taxes until its financial
difficulties are resolved, Slezosky said.
   DCA spokesman Fred Reddig said the agency would ask borough
officials to reconsider a bankruptcy filing until all avenues are
exhausted through the state's programs.
   He said a bankruptcy filing would be the first his agency is
aware of by a Pennsylvania municipality.
   Borough records showed only a $69,000 debt, but an independent
audit ordered in January by the council's new Republican majority
uncovered almost $400,000 in unpaid bills from the past
administration, Slezosky said.
   A recent tax-anticipation loan received to pay current bills
pushed the borough's total debt to about $450,000, Slezosky said.

<HEAD>Colombia Threatened by `Human Rights Emergency,' Amnesty Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Embargoed For Release at 8:01 p.m. EDT _ Time Set By Source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombia's armed forces have placed the country in
a ``human rights emergency'' by extending repression to include not
just leftists but anyone who does not support the military, Amnesty
International said Wednesday.
   A report by the London-based human rights group said Colombia
has entered a new phase of political repression that threatens its
social fabric.
   Murder is purportedly the main cause of death among men between
the ages of 15-44, and many victims of political killings ``are
tortured and then hideously disfigured both to prevent
identification and to instill terror,'' according to the report.
   It states: ``A policy of terror and political murder by the
Colombian armed forces, which has already resulted in thousands of
killings and `disappearances' in recent years, now threatens the
civic, cultural and academic lifeblood of the country.
   ``Political repression in Colombia has entered a new phase and
the country is in the grip of a human rights emergency.''
   Amnesty International said the new phase began last July with
the publication of ``hit lists'' of prominent Colombians and a wave
of killings of students, university lecturers and human rights
leaders in the city of Medellin.
   Medellin, Colombia's second largest city, is the base for a drug
cartel which is considered responsible for much of the cocaine
shipped to the United States.
   The Amnesty report asserts that large-scale human rights
violations in Colombia stem from ``a deliberate policy of political
murder'' by the armed forces.
   It said increased human rights violations ``have occurred in the
context of renewed guerrilla activity and pressure for social and
political reform.''
   But since mid-1987 ``the range of victims has extended far
beyond left-wing opponents of the government. The people now
singled out are not only those who criticize the goivernment or the
armed forces, but also those who merely fail to support them.''
   ``Whole sectors of society are at risk of being considered
`subversive,' and in Colombia that is tantamount to a death
sentence,'' it adds.
   The report quoted Colombian human rights leaders as saying the
government attributes the killings to uncontrollable civilian
gunmen.
   ``But hundreds of case studies show that killings and
`disappearances' blamed on the `death squads' were in fact carried
out by police and military personnel and their civilian
auxiliaries, acting on the authority of the army high command,''
according to Amnesty International.
   ``Perhaps the most conclusive evidence that the `death squads'
are an integral part of the Colombian security forces is the simple
fact that no one has been prosecuted and convicted for the
thousands of political killings and `disappearances' attributed to
them,'' it said.
   The report said most of the 500 political prisoners freed under
amnesty decrees in 1982 have been killed or exiled or have
disappeared.
   Last year, 15 members of a Colombian human rights organization
received death threats, four were killed, one disappeared and five
fled the country, the report said.
   It quoted Colombia's national teachers union as saying more than
300 members received death threats in 1987 and 15 were slain.
   Amnesty International said the government is responsible for
human rights and it must bring the security forces under control.

   About 10,000 people held
anti-government street demonstrations Tuesday to mark a student
uprising that ousted South Korea's first government 28 years ago.
   National police reported ``some arrests'' during clashes in
Seoul and elsewhere but would not give figures. There were no
reports of injuries.
   Ferryboat crews in Mokpo, a major southwestern port, went on
strike Tuesday, adding to a new wave of labor unrest. Labor
Ministry officials reported 363 labor disputes so far this year, of
which 75 are unresolved.
   Yonhap, South Korea's domestic news agency, gave the estimate of
the number of demonstrators in Seoul and other cities Tuesday, the
anniversary of a student march April 19, 1960, during which police
shot down 125 people. The 1960 uprising spread through the country
and President Syngman Rhee resigned.
   In downtown Seoul, about 3,000 students clashed with riot police
sporadically until late at night, shouting ``Down with
dictatorship!'' and ``Let's fight back, democracy!''
   The protesters, most of them students, hurled rocks and
firebombs at police, who responded with tear gas.
   About a dozen students set a police bus and passenger car ablaze
by throwing firebombs into them near Pagoda Park in central Seoul.
   One young man shouted in front of the burning bus: ``We will
never succumb to dictatorship! The April 19 student spirit is alive
and will be kept alive forever!''
   Riot police overpowered a group of students a block away and
arrested seven or eight, and about a dozen protesters were taken
away elsewhere in the capital, according to reports from witnesses.
   Thousands of plainclothes or riot police had moved into central
Seoul in anticipation of student protests, which have been a
regular event on the anniversary.
   Street battles often interrupted traffic in the evening rush
hour but passers-by appeared to pay little attention, except for
using gauze masks against tear gas.
   Before the street protests, about 4,000 students and dissidents
attended a memorial rally at a cemetery on Seoul's northern
outskirts where nearly 200 people killed in 1960 are buried.
   Protesters announced formation of a new student-dissident
alliance to campaign against the governing Democratic Justice Party
in the April 26 National Assembly elections.

<HEAD>Little Red Lighthouse Considered for Landmark Status</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SHANAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A little red lighthouse brought to life in a
1942 children's story was proposed for landmark status Tuesday by a
9-year-old who clambered up to the microphone at a hearing to
retell the tale of the proud beacon.
   Standing on a chair at the Landmarks Preservation Commission
hearing, Jonny Goldin said that his father, City Comptroller
Harrison Goldin, read him ``The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great
Gray Bridge'' when he was ``a little boy.''
   ``I found it hard to imagine it really existed,'' Jonny said at
the City Hall hearing. But his father later took him to see it on
the bank of the Hudson River in the shadow of the George Washington
Bridge in upper Manhattan.
   ``We should make sure that it is always there for boys and girls
to enjoy forever,'' Jonny said.
   Supporters of making the 67-year-old lighthouse known
technically as Jeffrey's Hook Light a landmark say the beacon
recalls the age of mariners in America and has special significance
to children of all ages.
   Once a structure is designated a landmark, changes in it require
commission approval.
   Gene A. Norman, commission chairman, said it could take several
months to examine staff studies before deciding whether The Little
Red Lighthouse should become a landmark.
   The children's story by Hildegarde Hoyt Swift and Lynd Ward
tells how the lighthouse coped with suddenly being overshadowed by
the bridge.
   ``You know the story,'' Jonny told the commission. ``The
lighthouse is proud of its job warning ships and tugboats and
barges not to come too close to the rocky shore of the Hudson
River.''
   However, the George Washington Bridge is built later, the story
goes, and the beacon is in danger of being closed because the
bridge has a warning light on one of its towers.
   ``At the end of the book, though, the lighthouse is still seen
as necessary for safe navigation, and the bridge calls it `Little
Brother','' young Goldin related.
   Real life wasn't as kind to the lighthouse. Six years after the
1942 book was published, the Coast Guard took the light out of
service.
   Built in 1921, it was a replacement for a simple light pole with
two 10-candlepower oil lanterns. The bridge opened in 1931.
   The lighthouse is a cylindrical steel and cast-iron structure,
40 feet high and 14{-feet in diameter. Resting on a concrete slab,
it rises 61 feet above the water.
   The commission also is considering a proposal to make a
60-foot-high Pepsi-Cola neon sign on the East River waterfront in
Queens a landmark.
   Built in 1936, it is considered by the commission staff to be an
excellent example of neon display technology that began to
transform outdoor advertising in the 1920s.
   Its designation as a landmark was opposed by Queens Borough
President Claire Shulman, who said it could delay development of a
$155 million project for residential, commercial and recreational
use of the area.
   Former Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis, an attorney for Pepsico
Inc., asked for a delay in any designation so the soft drink firm
could study the proposal.

   A civilian court acting on
complaints by human rights groups ordered Tuesday that Gen. Gustavo
Alvarez Martinez, the former military commander, be held for
possible trial.
   The warrant ordered Alvarez Martinez into house arrest for six
days. During that time Judge Suazo Lara of the First Criminal Court
must either issue a formal indictment on charges of murder and
other human rights abuses or order the case dropped for lack of
evidence.
   Suazo acted on a petition by the Committee of Relatives of
Disappeared People and the Human Rights Commission, which claim
Alvarez Martinez was responsible for the killings of 30 people and
the disappearance of 130 others in the custody of security forces.
   They say the killings and disappearances occurred during the
four years Alvarez Martinez was chief of the armed forces and
effective head of state. He was forced out by fellow officers April
31, 1984, and went to live in Miami but returned to Tegucigalpa on
April 9.

   NBC won its third television season in a row
Tuesday and is already looking toward another win next season when
its Summer Olympics coverage could give it a jump on the
competition if the writers' strike continues.
   If the 6-week-old strike isn't settled soon, ABC and CBS might
not have new shows ready for air in September and could be forced
to continue summer reruns _and that could speed a continuing
defection of viewers to cable and other alternatives.
   NBC, meanwhile, will start the season with the historically
high-rated Olympics, and NBC's Vice President for Research Projects
Gerald Jaffe said Tuesday that advertising interest in the Olympics
is ``picking up.''
   NBC topped off the season by winning the final week, though the
60th Annual Academy Awards on ABC was the No. 1 show of the week,
according to the A.C. Nielsen Co. figures. For the week, NBC had an
average rating of 13.9, ABC 13.5 and CBS 11.8. The rating is a
percentage of the nation's 88.6 million homes with television.
   NBC ended the season with an average, prime-time rating of 16.0.
ABC, which had been third for three years running, eked out second
with a 13.7, thanks to the World Series, Super Bowl and Winter
Olympics. CBS was third for the first time ever, with 13.5. The
rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million households with
televisions.
   NBC had never won a season before 1985-86. This was NBC's
biggest win yet, and the biggest margin of victory for any network
since CBS won in 1963-64.
   But Nielsen ratings showed the three-network average down 9
percent from last year. That figure was disputed by Jaffe, who said
his own comparison of more extensive local-market surveys showed a
network decline of only 3 percent.
   He attributed the discrepancy to inaccuracies in Nielsen's new
people meter audience measurement system.
   Last week, CBS released preliminary figures from a competing
ratings company, AGB, that showed CBS coming in slightly ahead of
ABC. Nielsen is still the ratings company used by advertisers to
negotiate advertising rates, though. CBS has estimated that the
lower people meter figures will cost the networks a combined $50
million in advertising revenues.
   The three networks have hired a consulting firm to scrutinize
the new ratings system, said Bill Rubens, NBC vice president for
research. The results are expected sometime this summer.
   Whether 9 percent or 3 percent, though, the networks are losing
viewers to cable, independent stations and VCRs.
   Jaffe said the decline is reversible if networks can put on
enough popular shows like ``The Cosby Show,'' which increased total
network viewing on Thursday night.
   ``The 3 percent is not immutable,'' Jaffe said. ``There is no
law of nature that says the networks will decline 3 percent every
year, ad infinitum.''
   ``The Cosby Show'' was the No. 1-rated show for the third year
in a row, followed by its spinoff, ``A Different World,'' NBC's
``Cheers'' and ``Golden Girls,'' ABC's ``Growing Pains,'' ``Who's
the Boss?'' NBC's ``Night Court,'' CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and
``Murder, She Wrote,'' and ABC's new show, ``The Wonder Years.''
   Of the two new shows that made the top 10, both were
significantly helped by their popular lead-ins, ``A Different
World'' by ``Cosby'' and ``Wonder Years'' by ``Who's the Boss?''
   The only other new shows to make even the top 30 were NBC's ``My
Two Dads'' at 21st, ``In the Heat of the Night,'' at 19th, and
``Aaron's Way'' at 30th. The latter two premiered late in the
season.
   Despite the lackluster performance by the new shows, Jaffe
predicted a third of them will be renewed, following the pattern of
previous years.
   The networks have parted company with big-event, multipart
miniseries. Of 12 miniseries last year, all but two were
two-parters. The top-rated ``Elvis and Me'' on ABC had rating of
24.5.
   ``The Ann Jillian Story'' on NBC was the top-rated TV movie with
23.8.
   News ratings are measured quarterly, not by season, but
beginning with the traditional television season in September when
Nielsen converted to the people meters, ``NBC Nightly News''
dropped into a third-place slump. Last week, the ``CBS Evening
News'' was No. 1 with a 10.1 and 21 share, narrowly edging ABC's
``World News Tonight'' with 9.9 and 20. ``NBC Nightly News'' had an
8.7 and 18.
   The share is a percentage of sets in use.

<HEAD>Police Buy Bigger Motorcycles to Battle Motorcycle Gang</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have bought powerful motorcycles to battle
a Moscow motorcycle gang called the Rockers that has caused
accidents and disturbed residents of the capital, Tass reported
Tuesday.
   The official news agency said police purchased German-made BMW
motorcycles that can travel up to 136 mph, but it did not say how
many.
   Tass said the Rockers will not be able to escape police pursuers
because their motorcycles are no match for the BMWs.
   It quoted N. Kurbatov, a captain of the police unit assigned to
stop the gang, as saying his officers concentrate in Moscow's ``hot
spots'' where ``motorhooligans'' prowl the streets, with the noise
of their machines awaking residents.
   ``The Rockers become active with the onset of warm days,'' Tass
said. ``Beginning April 1, a day hasn't gone by when because of
them there hasn't been a traffic accident with casualties. In these
accidents not only the hotheads suffer but also passengers sitting
behind their backs, as a rule minors who like to ride with the
wind.''
   It said 10,000 people are killed yearly in motorcycle accidents
throughout the Soviet Union.
   The agency said that since the beginning of April, Moscow police
have detained 62 ``supermen on motorcycles'' for lacking proper
documents, license plates or mufflers and for speeding or ignoring
traffic signs.
   Last year, Moscow's automobile clubs, youth organizations and
the city council tried unsucessfully to persuade the Rockers to
join official organizations or ride in designated areas where they
wouldn't disturb anyone.
   ``Now that they rejected this and that, maybe that's enough
persuasion,'' Tass said. ``It's time to move on to legal action.''

<HEAD>Sudan Says It Will Not Allow Any Influx of Ethiopian Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi said Tuesday
that Sudan was ``saturated'' with refugees and he would not accept
the expected influx of hundreds of thousands of people fleeing from
neighboring Ethiopia.
   Western relief officials expressed fear there could be heavy
loss of life among Ethiopia's refugees.
   Mahdi said he discussed the situation with Ethiopia's Marxist
government and with the U.N. Office of High Commissioner for
Refugees and other relief organizations. He said the talks were
aimed at organizing aid shipments to the affected people in the
Tigre and Eritrea regions in northern Ethiopia, or at setting up
camps inside Ethiopia near the border with Sudan.
   Secessionist warfare in the two regions complicates delivery of
relief to millions of people suffering because of famine and
drought.
   In a 30-minute interview at his Khartoum headquarters, the prime
minister told The Associated Press:
   ``We think that Sudan has been saturated and we cannot take any
more refugees.''
   He said he made that known last October.
   The U.N. agency estimates there are around 900,000 refugees in
Sudan including 677,000 Ethiopians. Sudan puts the figure at close
to 2 million.
   Mahdi was elected prime minister in April 1986, a year after a
military coup overthrew President Gaafar Nimeiri.
   Western relief officials here, speaking on condition of
anonymity, say from 2 million to 3 million Ethiopians in Tigre and
Eritrea will be affected by an expected Ethiopian government
offensive against rebels. The officials expect refugees by the
hundreds of thousands to move toward eastern Sudan within the next
month.
   They said there is no stockpile of relief food in the
drought-affected areas. The Ethiopian government recently banned
relief organizations from working in the northern zones.
   Mahdi said Sudan suggested it can help relief agencies send food
to Tigre and Eritrea across the Sudanese border, or set up camps
within Ethiopian territory to receive refugees.
   One relief official said he feared that once the rainy season
begins next month, it would be extremely difficult to move enough
food aid to eastern Sudan to handle the expected influx, whether it
was in Sudanese or Ethiopian territory.
   ``We will be hamstrung, and there could be large numbers of
fatalities,'' the official said.
   Over the weekend, Mahdi handed in his Cabinet's resignation to
form a new coalition government representing a greater number of
political parties. The five-man sovereign council, which acts in
place of a president, accepted the Cabinet's resignation but kept
Mahdi in power so he could form a new Cabinet.
   Mahdi said the new coaltion will include his centrist Umma
Party; the centrist Democratic Unionist Party, Umma's coaltion
partner for the past two years; the Moslem National Islamic Front;
the Southern Parties, and the small National Sudanese Party.
   Mahdi, discussing Sudan's own war in the south, said he hoped
improving relations with Ethiopia would gradually lead to an end of
Ethiopian aid to the rebel group the Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   The rebels are asking for greater autonomy as well as economic
and administrative reforms.
   In Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, the government said
U.N. aid workers can resume drought relief operations in the
war-torn north but more than 50 other Western workers remain barred
from the region, an official there said Tuesday.
   The policy reversal affects only four of 60 Western relief
workers.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said in Washington
the Ethiopian decision was ``a positive development. It's
important, however, to permit a wide range of private voluntary
organizations to work in the area if the needs of those at risk are
to be met.''

<TEXT>
   The families of two Marines from a
helicopter missing in the Persian Gulf awaited news and held out
hope Tuesday.
   ``There are times that we _ my wife and I _ feel stronger than
at others. There's times, particularly when we look at his
pictures, we find we're not as strong as we think,'' said Bob Hill,
father of Capt. Kenneth W. Hill, 33.
   Hill and the other crewman, Capt. Stephen C. Leslie, 30, are
assigned to Squadron HMLA-167 at the New River, N.C., Marine Corps
Air Station, said Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard.
   Leslie's home of record is New Bern; Hill's is Thomasville, the
Pentagon said.
   The attack helicopter failed to return from a reconnaissance
mission Monday.
   Iran claims to have shot down the helicopter during fighting in
which Iranian ships were sunk or crippled. Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci refused to speculate about the aircraft's fate.
   President Reagan said nine ships were taking part in the search
Tuesday.
   ``We're just trying to hold out hope that they are going to be
picked up,'' that both of the men are going to found safe and
sound,'' said the elder Hill. ``It's hard to really earnestly hope
for it and believe it, but we hold to it.''
   Hill said the family received word about 9:30 p.m. Monday that
their son was missing. Hill said his son was married with one son.
   Leslie's younger sister, Kris Leslie, said the family received
word around midnight that her brother was missing. She said the
family had received no details since. ``We're very numb right
now,'' Ms. Leslie said.
   Leslie and his wife, Lisa, live in Jacksonville. He has been in
the Persian Gulf area since the end of January, Ms. Leslie said.

<HEAD>Heavy Snow in Northern California</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A storm brought heavy snow to parts of northern California and
western Nevada on Tuesday, while large areas of the rest of the
nation had rain.
   The high elevations of Lassen Park in northern California
received one to two feet of snow. Rainfall at lower elevations
totaled as much as 1{ inches in northeastern parts of the state.
   The storm also brought nearly a quarter inch of rain to the San
Francisco Bay area, which has had little more than traces of rain
for most of the past 12 weeks. Water authorities said the rain
would provide little relief from the region's drought.
   A winter storm warning continued through Tuesday night over
parts of central and northern California, with two feet or more of
new snow expected in higher elevations.
   Light snow also dusted the mountains of West Virginia and
western New York state.
   Rain and thunderstorms hit central and northeast Florida. Tampa,
Fla. received 0.95 inch of rain in the six hours ending at 1 p.m.
EDT, and Titusville, Fla. was hit with heavy rain and hail three
quarters of an inch in diameter.
   Rain also stretched from central Colorado to southeast Wyoming.
Along the Atlantic Coast, rain also hit eastern Virginia, Delaware
and Maryland.
   The nation's morning low was 12 degrees at Aberdeen, S.D., which
was 3 degrees below the city's previous record, set in 1928.
   The mercury dropped to record lows in three Iowa cities early
Tuesday and tied all-time lows in three other locations. There were
reports of damage to apple trees as lows were registered in the
upper teens and low 20s.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 33 degrees at Wallops
Island, Va., to 90 degrees at Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   Scattered rain was forecast Wednesday over northern Maine and
upper Michigan. Showers and possibly a few thunderstorms were
predicted to extend from the Pacific Coast to the Rockies, with
snow at higher elevations.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 30s and 40s in northern
Minnesota, the northern half of the Great Lakes and northern New
England. Highs were predicted to reach the 70s and 80s across the
south and southwest, stretching as far north as southern Nebraska
and South Carolina. Highs in most other parts of the country will
be in the 50s and 60s.

   Iran on Tuesday complained to the United
Nations about U.S. attacks in the Persian Gulf where the U.S. Navy
destroyed or disabled two Iranian oil platforms and six naval
vessels the day before.
   Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati said Iran has the
right to retaliate by any means available for the American ``acts
of war'' and ``direct participation ... on behalf of Iraq.'' Iran
and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.
   The United States defended its action as ``necessary and
proportionate'' to the threat posed by Iranian actions. It told the
Security Council that U.S. forces ``exercised their inherent right
of self-defense.''
   A letter from U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun, released Tuesday,
said the American actions were against ``legitimate military
targets'' and the United States does not seek a military
confrontation with Iran.
   Ali Akbar Velayati, the Iranian foreign minister, made his
complaint by letter. He asked Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar and the Security Council to condemn ``this American act of
aggression.''
   ``It is also expected that immediate preventative measures are
taken to stop the future recurrence of such crimes,'' said the
letter, published Tuesday as a U.N. document. It said Iran ``will
under no circumstances surrender to the politics of force and
manipulation and will certainly not leave this latest act of
injustice unanswered.''
   Velayati's letter cited the attacks on the oil platforms, which
it called ``premeditated acts of aggression'' by the ``war-monger
U.S. administration.''
   ``American attacks simply indicate a plan by both the United
States and Iraq to aggress against Iran to divert attention from
the heinous war crimes of Iraq, particularly the chemical
bombing,'' the letter said.
   President Reagan ordered the platforms attacked as retaliation
for a mine that damaged a U.S. warship last week and wounded 10
crew members.
   Okun's letter said: ``U.S. forces have exercised their inherent
right of self-defense under international law by taking defensive
action in response to an attack by the Islamic Republic of Iran
against a U.S. naval vessel in international waters. ... The
actions taken are necessary and proportionate to the threat posed
by such hostile Iranian actions.''
   It referred to Iranian mine-laying and said U.S. forces
``attacked military targets which have been used for attacks
against non-belligerent shipping in international waterways of the
gulf.'' The United States said the platforms were used as bases for
Iranian speedboats that attack neutral vessels.
   Mahallati rejected the claim of self-defense and called the
attacks on oil platforms ``nothing more than premeditated armed
reprisal.''
   He challenged the United States to produce evidence that the
mines were laid by Iran, and declared: ``There is no doubt that
Iraq and its agents have been mining the commercial lanes'' of the
gulf.

   Israel remembered its more than 16,000 war dead
in Memorial Day ceremonies Tuesday and Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir told the nation's enemies: ``All those who hurt us will be
hurt manifold.''
   Sirens sounded throughout the country Tuesday night, bringing
activity to a standstill for one minute as Israelis remembered the
soldiers killed in wars with their Arab neighbors.
   President Chaim Herzog ignited a memorial torch at the Western
Wall, holiest site of Judaism, in a ceremony attended by relatives
of fallen soldiers.
   ``The whole nation is aware of the heavy loss, the loss of life,
the hopes that went up in the smoke of war,'' Herzog said. ``We
have to be aware that this is the price we pay for our freedom and
our independence.''
   Memorial Day ends Wednesday night with another torch-lighting
ceremony at Mount Herzl that starts the celebration of Israel's
40th Independence Day. Memorial Day always is the day before
Independence Day.
   Israeli authorities increased security for the two holidays,
fearing Palestinian attacks on Israeli targets in connection with
the 4-month-old Arab uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Soldiers erected roadblocks in the occupied territories Tuesday
night and officials said only Arabs with special permits would be
allowed into Israel until Independence Day celebrations end
Thursday night.
   Police Commissioner David Krauss said extra police were posted
throughout the country to prevent possible terror attacks and about
1,000 officers would patrol Jerusalem until the Moslem sabbath ends
Friday.
   ``There is information that terror organizations will try to
carry out attacks. ... We ask the public to be alert and call
police if they see a suspect object or irregular activity,'' Krauss
said on Israel radio.
   Shamir declared at a ceremony attended by hundreds of relatives
of soldiers killed in battle: ``Let's hope that our enemies will
realize and understand that Israel knows how to wage war, and that
all those who hurt us will be hurt manifold.
   ``There is no use and purpose in our enemies' repeated attempts
to destroy us. When our enemies realize this and accept the
existence of the state of Israel, we will know that we have won
life and peace because of our fallen soldiers.''
   Army officials said 16,415 Israeli soldiers have been killed
since independence in 1948, including 785 in the 1967 war, 2,679 in
the 1973 war and 1,183 in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon and
three-year occupation.
   Most of Israel's 3.5 million Jews have lost relatives in wars.
The 700,000 Arab citizens do not serve in the army.
   Sirens are to sound again at 11 a.m. Wednesday for the start of
memorial services at military cemeteries. Places of entertainment,
including movie theaters and restaurants, were ordered closed for
Memorial Day.

   A man died Tuesday of wounds suffered in a
gang-related barrage of gunfire that killed his 6-year-old daughter
in their home.
   Meanwhile, a 16-year-old girl was slain on a street corner in an
apparent gang drive-by shooting Tuesday, authorities said.
   Salvador Saucedo, 39, died at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew
Medical Center two days after his daughter Irma was slain at their
home in what her 13-year-old brother said was a grudge over a
baseball cap of the wrong color.
   The Sheriff's Department continued its search for two men who
sprayed the home with bullets from a car Sunday night in Compton.
   Saucedo's wife, Maria Hernandez, 39, was in critical condition.
The girl's brother and cousin were slightly injured.
   ``It started with this hat,'' said Martin Saucedo, who suffered
a minor stomach wound. He said gang members had tried to take his
Kansas City Royals hat, which is blue, the color worn by the gang
the Crips.
   ``The guys that jumped me said it was a gang hat and I should
give it to them. I said no, I bought it with my own money at the
Paramount swap meet and it was mine,'' the teen-ager said.
   Martin's parents called deputies who broke up the fight, but the
gang members apparently returned, authorities said.
   On Tuesday, an unidentified 16-year-old girl was killed by shots
from a passing car in Paramount, southeast of Los Angeles, said
sheriff's Deputy Leo Weitzel. He said the slaying apparently was
gang-related.
   Gang violence has claimed at least 93 lives in 1988, according
to Los Angeles County law enforcement authorities.

<TEXT>
   Tons of Soviet supplies including
arms and ammunition are being flown into Kabul as Soviet troops
prepare to withdraw, Western diplomatic sources said Tuesday.
   The diplomats, speaking in Islamabad on condition of anonymity,
said their contacts in the Afghan capital reported nightly arrivals
of Soviet AN-12 and IL-76 transports at the Kabul airport the past
week.
   They said the mood in Kabul generally was calm in the wake of
the April 14 signing of an accord in Switzerland for the withdrawal
of the estimated 115,000 Soviet military personnel in Afghanistan.
   The sources reported East European diplomats were saying the
Soviet troops probably would first pull back from the eastern area
of Afghanistan when the withdrawal begins May 15. The Soviets sent
troops into Afghanistan in December 1979 to help the Marxist
government fight anti-communist rebels.
   Although the Soviets are to withdraw under the Geneva agreement,
the civil war is expected to continue. Rebel leaders said they
would fight on and America plans to continue providing aid to the
rebels while the Soviets support government forces.
   The Western diplomats said some of the new Soviet supplies are
beging moved south of Kabul in truck convoys, possibly for storage.
   There also have been reports of heavy fighting east and south of
the capital.
   The sources said that on April 11, a Soviet convoy with more
than 450 vehicles including tanks, mobile rocket launchers and
other armored equipment headed for Logar province, immediately
south of Kabul.
   Guerrilla activity has intensified this spring in provinces
bordering Pakistan, according to various reports.
   The rebels usually launch operations as the winter snow melts,
but guerrilla leaders vowed this year to step up the war because of
the Geneva accord that was framed without their participation.
   Prospects of a Soviet pullout have strengthened the Afghan
currency to 167 Afghanis to the dollar compared to 210 in February,
possibly in anticipation of a strong demand from returning
refugees, the sources said.
   They also said the price of Russian vodka on the local market
has doubled in recent weeks to the equivalent of $7.50 a bottle,
with Soviet personnel apparently stocking up before returning home.

   Pennsylvania, the next state in the
Democratic presidential marathon, may well offer a smooth path for
front-runner Michael Dukakis but for rival Jesse Jackson the April
26 primary is strewn with obstacles.
   ``We could win the state and lose 80 percent of the delegates,''
lamented Jackson delegate coodinator Steve Cobble.
   Pennsylvania's popular vote is merely a beauty contest and the
real winner in the primary must succeed in direct delegate
elections in the state's 23 congressional districts. A prize of 178
delegates, fourth largest of any state, is at stake.
   Jackson's core support is concentrated in three districts in
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, the state's two largest cities and
home to most of the state's blacks. Blacks make up about 11 percent
of the voting age population.
   Though turnout there may be the highest in the state and Jackson
could pull close to Dukakis in the overall popular vote, the
delegate races likely will swing overwhemlingly to Dukakis,
observers say.
   ``These direct delegate elections are unfair to blacks. It's one
of the last vestiges of Republican-type politics in the Democratic
Party and it ought to be done away with,'' Cobble said.
   Personal popularity of the individual delegate candidates
doesn't count for much since the name of the presidential hopeful
appears beside each committed delegate candidate.
   Dukakis was the only Democrat to field a complete slate of 116.
Jackson's campaign, in contrast, has only 79 district delegate
candidates and has turned to delegate-candidates pledged to former
contender Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and other former
candidates to fill out the gaps. The remaining 62 delegates will be
apportioned in June according to the district outcomes.
   Some political veterans say Jackson could win no more than 30
delegates.
   ``Even in a best scenario how he (Jackson) gets more than 30
delegates I don't know,'' G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center
for Politics and Public Affairs at Millersville University.
   State Democratic Chairman Larry Yatch, who along with Gov.
Robert P. Casey is neutral in the race, doesn't think Jackson's
slate-filling effort will be fruitful.
   But Jackson's campaign said late Tuesday afternoon it has
commitments from eight to 10 delegates of departed candidates to
support Jackson and is working on more.
   Jackson will win Philadelphia, where he is endorsed by Mayor W.
Wilson Goode and Rep. Bill Gray, but Dukakis is favored everywhere
else, Yatch said. Pittsburgh Mayor Richard Caliguiri and Erie Mayor
Louis Tullio both have endorsed Dukakis.
   The latest pre-primary poll, conducted Thursday through Sunday
by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and Philadelphia Daily News, showed
Dukakis with a 59 percent to 20 percent edge over Jackson. Gore
fell far back at 9 percent. The survey of 647 likely Democratic
voters had a margin of error of 5 percent.
   ``Mike is taking nothing for granted,'' said Dukakis'
Pennsylvania spokesman Pat McCarthy. He said a win could ``put Mike
over the psychological top'' on the road to the nomination.
   A strong showing in New York would help Jackson in Pennsylvania,
but Dukakis is favored right now, delegate coordinator Cobble said.
   Jackson, who won 16 percent of the vote and 18 delegates in the
three-way 1984 presidential primary, hopes to woo disaffected blue
collar workers, particularly in southwestern Pennsylvania, where
unemployment still runs into double digits in some areas.
Statewide, he is hoping at least to duplicate his record of
attracting 15 percent to 20 percent of the white vote.
   ``We'll do better than in 1984, exceed expectations and give
Dukakis a hell of a run for his money,'' said Janice Fine, a
national campaign aide. ``We're very competitive in Pennsylvania.''
   Democratic Lt. Gov. Mark Singel, also neutral, disagreed.
   ``The more likely scenario is that Dukakis uses Pennsylvania to
solidify his front-runnership, his hold on the nomination,'' Singel
said.
   Gore's moderate stands should have meshed with Pennsylvania's
voters, who gave the state to Ronald Reagan both in 1980 and 1984
and who haven't elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate since 1962.
In fact, Gore was endorsed as the most electable of the candidates
by the state Senate Democratic leadership. But Gore hasn't won
anywhere since Super Tuesday in his native South and the New York
primary results could signal the end of his campaign.
   There is also a Republican race, at least on paper, but Vice
President George Bush is expected to easily brush aside his only
remaining rival, Pat Robertson, in the contest for 78 delegates.

<HEAD>System Failure Was Worst Blackout in Quebec History</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Half a million customers in Quebec were without
electricity for several hours Tuesday in the aftermath of the
province's worst power blackout ever.
   Engineers at Hydro-Quebec, the provincially owned utility giant,
struggled to explain the outage which began at 8:09 p.m. EDT Monday
when ice knocked out a major transmission line from Labrador.
   The failure left at least 4 million customers in Quebec, New
Brunswick and scattered areas of northern Maine and Vermont without
electricity for up to seven hours.
   With three major power installations still off line Tuesday,
Hydro-Quebec appealed to Quebecers to conserve electricity.
   Utility spokesman Jacques-Andre Couture said a key question was
why an automatic relay switch failed to work when the power lines
from Churchill Falls, Labrador, went down. The switch should have
confined the outage to northern Quebec.
   Another mystery was why a power station at Beauharnois near
Montreal continued to feed power to New York state, instead of
fulfilling its role as a backup power supply for the Quebec system.
   Couture said the blackout cost Hydro-Quebec $3 million ($2.4
million U.S.) in revenue.
   It was the tenth systemwide outage for Hydro-Quebec in 15 years.
Officials conceded that neighboring New England utilities have a
better record.
   `They are designing their system with criteria which are more
severe than ours,'' said Jean-Claude Roy, a Hydro-Quebec vice
president.
   He said the company plans to spend $600 million ($486 million
U.S.) to upgrade the Quebec grid.
   Quebec Energy Minister John Caccia said he is not worried that
the incident will damage Hydro-Quebec's growing export market in
New England and New York.
   ``I didn't get any phone calls from our American clients,'' he
said.
   The initial outage stranded hundreds of passengers in the
Montreal subway and in elevators. The National Hockey League
playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and the Boston Bruins
was plunged into temporary darkness at the Montreal Forum, but
resumed under emergency lighting. Montreal won, 5-2.

   Vice President George Bush said Tuesday he
expects to face the winner of the New York Democratic primary,
Michael Dukakis, in the fall general election.
   ``It's a good bet, I think,'' Bush told reporters traveling with
him on Air Force II.
   He also defended supporter Frank Rizzo, former Philadelphia
mayor, and denied that Rizzo could cost him the votes of blacks.
   ``I'm certainly not going to write off the ethnic community in
this country because of a prejudiced view'' toward Rizzo, he said.
He said he had no hesitation to appear with Rizzo.
   He noted that in his last unsuccessful campaign for mayor, Rizzo
had lost narowly.
   ``To have people suggest that I should not appear with him
because I'm worried that will hurt me in some other area ... I
reject it as invalid liberal trash.''
   ``It's reverse discrimination,'' Bush told reporters.
   On the New York primary, Bush said, ``I do think that whoever
wins (in New York) will win the Democratic nomination.''
   Bush said he did not intend to criticize Dukakis right away. ``I
think I'll keep it generic until the convention,'' he said.
   However, he referred to Dukakis as ``an old-world liberal
Democrat.''
   Earlier, with Rizzo at his side, Bush told a Republican rally in
Philadelphia: ``I want to take on whichever one of those Democrats
wins today in New York _ and whip them in the fall.''
   At stops earlier in the day, Bush reiterated strong support for
the American military strikes against Iran's forces.
   Speaking to the Pennsylvania State Association of Township
Supervisors, Bush said support for the U.S. military response ``has
crossed partisan lines,'' both in Congress and ``around the world.''
   ``I'm proud to have stood with the president and in support of
the president,'' Bush said.
   In an interview with local reporters, Bush said, ``One has to
keep one's options entirely open'' for possible future steps in the
Gulf.
   Bush was asked whether arms the Reagan administration secretly
sold to Iran in an effort to free hostages had been used against
the United States or its allies in recent days. Democratic
presidential contender Jesse Jackson has hinted that such arms were
used.
   ``I'm not sure they've used them against us,'' he said. However,
he added ``some of the weapons used in this exchange'' likely came
from ``an inventory of weapons ... from a time when we were
strongly in support of a much more moderate Iran than we have
today.''
   ``Back in the Shah's (of Iran) days, we had a very active
program,'' Bush said. ``There is a certain historical irony to it.''
   On the day of the New York primary, where he was running
virtually unopposed, Bush campaigned across Pennsylvania and said
he doesn't care which nominee Democrats choose.
   ``I can't wait for the fall, I can't wait for the debates with
the Democratic nominee, no matter who he turns out to be. Even if
they unleash Mario Cuomo, I can't wait,'' Bush told a morning
Republican fundraiser in Lancaster.
   The New York governer has said he would not accept a draft, even
in the event of a brokered Democratic convention.
   Bush got a special tour of the Hershey chocolate factory and ate
lunch in the plant cafeteria with workers. He was also presented
with a two-foot chocolate seal of the vice president's office.
``Eat your heart out,'' he joked with reporters.
   Bush had planned to return to Washington for a National Security
Council meeting on the Persian Gulf in early afternoon, but changed
his plans and stayed in Pennsylvania when the meeting was cancelled.
   He also had evening events planned in the Philadelphia area.
   ``Things have quieted down,'' said spokesman Peter Teeley.
   ``He feels he's fully informed on what going on'' and doesn't
need to remain in Washington, Teeley said.
   Bush also reiterated his plans for establishing an ethics office
in the White House if elected.
   ``I'm personally concerned with the breeches of ethics I've seen
over the past years,'' Bush said. ``When a congressman goes bad, or
a member of the executive branch betrays the trust, you know I know
it hurts,'' he told a GOP fundraiser in Lancaster.
   But, he told reporters later in Hershey, ``Please don't
interpret that as criticism of (Attorney General) Ed Meese.''
   ``Democrats are going to try to make some (political mileage on
the) `sleeze issue,''' Bush added. ``Let them try. There's plenty
on the other side.''
   Bush also told reporters he had not yet begun the process of
deciding upon a running mate, brushing aside questions on whether
former Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh might be under
consideration.
   The former governor, now director of the Institute of Government
at Harvard University, accompanied Bush on his Pennsylvania swing.
   ``There's no list, long or short,'' Bush declared.

   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo complained Tuesday
that scrapping over Mideast issues overshadowed equally important
matters during the state's Democratic primary race.
   ``We didn't hear about AIDS, we didn't hear about drugs,'' Cuomo
said. ``We didn't hear about homelessness. We didn't have a
discussion on INF (intermediate-range nuclear forces).''
   The governor said the primary, won by Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, did not bring about a ``full ventilation of all the
issues.''
   ``If you could get a composite New York voter and read his or
her mind, they would say, `We're disappointed,''' he told reporters
at the state Capitol.
   The governor also said, however, that his state's primary was
not as divisive as some observers said it was.
   ``It is not accurate to say that this was an extremely negative
campaign. That is simply not accurate. It is not accurate to say
that there were obvious signs of severe racial tension,'' he said.
   ``Jesse (Jackson) and Mike (Dukakis) ... were quick to state
that aside from the mayor's comments there was no harsh criticism
from any political leaders,'' Cuomo said.
   ``I saw no fruit thrown. I heard no ugly epithets from crowds. I
saw no disorderly conduct. I saw no one unruly at debates. I saw no
one struck or even abused in any way,'' he said.
   The governor said the Middle East is a ``very important issue''
but one that seemed to have ``an eclipsing effect.''
   Mideast issues, of major concern to the state's large bloc of
Jewish voters, were magnified when New York City Mayor Edward I.
Koch endorsed Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., in large part because
of Gore's pro-Israel stance.
   Koch said Jews would have to be ``crazy'' to vote for Jesse
Jackson because of his attitudes toward Israel and a Palestinian
state.

   A pre-dawn tornado exploded through this
rural North Florida community Tuesday, killing four people,
destroying homes, throwing people from their beds and leaving much
of a college campus in ruins.
   Only rubble was left in some neighborhoods after the tornado cut
a swath 12 miles long and at least a half-mile wide about 4:30 a.m.
Eighteen people suffered injuries requiring hospital treatment. The
mobile home of two of those who were killed vanished from its lot,
leaving only foundation blocks.
   Families were thrown out of bed while windows exploded and their
homes collapsed on top of them.
   ``I woke up with a roaring sound and as soon as I woke up, the
windows blew out on both sides of my bed, and the roof came down on
top of me,'' said Mitchell May, who was pinned in the debris for
three hours.
   His neighbor, Diane Dempsey, said she and her husband, Pat, had
only moments to rush their three children, ages 4 to 11, into the
bathroom before the tornado hit.
   ``They were screaming `are we dying, are we dying?''' she said.
``Then it was over as soon as it started.''
   It was Florida's worst tornado since 1966 when a twister crossed
the state from Clearwater to Cape Kennedy, killing 11 and injuring
400 people. In 1962 a tornado on the Florida Panhandle killed 17
people and injured 100.
   Gov. Bob Martinez flew to inspect the scene and said he intended
to sign an emergency order allowing state and federal aid.
   ``It's been tragic,'' said Martinez.
   Lawmen from the state and surrounding counties were already on
hand, and state prisoners were expected soon to help with the
cleanup, said Sheriff Joe Peavy.
   The twister's destructive path started in front of a shopping
center and headed straight into North Florida Community College,
where it ``totaled the new library and took the roof off the
auditorium,'' Peavy said.
   College President William H. McCoy estimated damage at between
$20 million and $25 million. Three of the campus' 14 buildings were
destroyed and nine heavily damaged, he said.
   It also demolished numerous homes, blew the roof off a nearby
church, overturned cars and knocked down trees, Peavy said.
   It ripped apart the only obstetrical clinic serving a
four-county area around Madison, leaving 350 to 400 mothers a year
without a place to have their babies, said Betsy Stone, executive
director of the Tri-County Community Medical Center. No one was
injured there, however.
   The worst damage was in the vicinity of Pinetta, a cross-roads
neighborhood near Madison.
   ``I almost fell to my knees it was so strong,'' said Otis
Williams, 69. His son's home across the street was destroyed.
   Also in Pinetta, the bodies of Robert and Lavelle McCullough
were thrown 100 yards and their mobile home disappeared, leaving
behind only a dozen cinder blocks on a bare patch of ground.
   Mrs. McCullough's sister, Dorothy Butler of nearby Jennings,
surveyed the damage a few hours after learning her sister had died.
   ``It didn't leave any of it. Not even a dish,'' she said
disbelievingly. ``You'd never know there was a trailer here.''
   Sheriff's spokesman Juan Botino identified the two other victims
as Walter Oliver Jr. and Dearmiste Pinesett. Of the 18 injuries,
two of the more seriously hurt were flown 50 miles to Tallahassee
Memorial Regional Medical Center. Brad Williams, 14, was in serious
condition Tuesday after surgery for a punctured kidney, and Mary
Kay Smith was in fair condition with a chest injury, a spokesman
said. Ms. Smith's age was unavailable.
   Two others remained in good condition in Madison County Memorial
Hospital, administrator Jeannie Baker said.
   About 100 miles to the west, two tornadoes touched down in
Jackson County, causing two minor injuries and destroying three
houses and a mobile home, as well as heavily damaging five other
homes, said John Mader, the county emergency management director.
   The same storm that spawned the tornadoes swept through south
Georgia late Monday and early Tuesday, ripping off roofs, tearing
down trees and injuring at least four people in mobile homes that
were tossed about by strong winds.

<TEXT>
   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York said Tuesday he
hoped his visit would advance political as well as church relations
between Cuba and the United States.
   He also said that years of religious restrictions in Cuba had
not hurt the spirit of its worshipers.
   The Roman Catholic prelate _ the first American cardinal to
visit Cuba since Fidel Castro came to power in 1959 _ hugged
Archbishop Jaime Ortega of Havana after stepping off the private
plane that brought him to Jose Marti Airport from Santiago, Cuba.
   He also shook hands with Jose Felipe Carneado, a member of the
Communist Party's Central Committee.
   O'Connor described his day in Santiago, 430 miles away, as
``wonderful,'' and spoke glowingly of the reception he received at
the Mass he celebrated there Monday night.
   ``The moment we arrived, they burst into thunderous applause,
and the applause hardly stopped throughout the entire Mass. They
applauded everything, and it was all spontaneous,'' he said.
   ``It was clear they were overjoyed by our visit and that the
faith is very, very deep.''
   O'Conner added, ``Despite the fact that there have been many
restrictions in the past on the free exercise of their faith, it's
there, it's still there.''
   The cardinal said much of the enthusiasm was due to the presence
of Monsignor Raul Del Valle of the New York archdiocese, who was a
priest in Havana before going to the United States in 1961.
   It was Del Valle's first visit to Cuba since he left.
   O'Connor was invited here by Cuban bishops to celebrate the
200th anniversary of the birth of Felix Varela, a Cuban priest who
served in New York City from 1823-53.
   ``It is my hope that Felix Varela will form a bridge _ a bridge
between the church in Cuba and the church in New York. And who
knows, when there is a strong bridge between the two churches, then
perhaps, many others can go back and forth across that bridge and
other kinds of peaceful reunion (may) take place between two
peoples who are separated by such a small body of water and who
together dream of peace,'' the New York archbishop said.
   O'Connor arrived in Cuba one day after the 27th anniversary of
the Castro government's victory at the Bay of Pigs over invading
anti-communist Cuban exile forces, who were backed by the United
States. When asked if it concerned him, he said ``Oh! Is that
right? I didn't even think of that.''
   He added, ``We'll pray for everybody who was involved and for
all who lost their lives.''
   It wasn't known if the cardinal would meet with Castro during
his three days in Havana. His schedule includes private meetings
with religous leaders.
   In 1985, a group of American archbishops met Castro during a
visit to Cuba.
   ``It would be very presumptuous of me to suggest I would be
seeing him,'' O'Connor said. But he added, ``anyone visiting any
country is always available when the president of the country
wishes to see him.''
   O'Connor said his visit and that of other religious leaders to
Cuba in recent years indicated ``significant movement'' by the
Cuban government in religious affairs, and he indicated he would be
taking careful notes to report to the Vatican.
   Pope John Paul II is scheduled to visit Latin America this year.
   ``I would be surprised if the Holy Father did not want to try to
visit Cuba sometime in the future,'' O'Connor said. ``I am unaware
of any concrete plans, but clearly the Holy See would observe
carefully the visit of any cardinal to any country to see how he
was received and what the response was on the part of the
government.''
   Of Cuba's 10.2 million people, an estimated 41 percent are Roman
Catholic.

<TEXT>
   Support from Jewish voters and a strong boost
from white Catholics lifted Michael Dukakis to victory in the New
York primary Tuesday, while Jesse Jackson's support came chiefly
from black voters, polls said.
   Racial division was a prominent feature of the race, with
Jackson winning a huge proportion of the black vote but just a
moderate share of white votes, polls said. Still, Jackson's white
vote was more than twice its 1984 level.
   Dukakis' three-quarter share of the Jewish vote countered
Jackson's black support, and Jackson led well but not
overwhelmingly among Hispanics, polls said. That left Catholic
whites as a swing vote, and many chose Dukakis.
   In incomplete returns, ABC News-Washington Post and NBC News
exit polls said Dukakis won about 70 percent of the white Catholic
vote, roughly 75 percent of the Jewish vote and 60 percent of the
smaller group of white Protestants. The numbers could change
slightly as final results came in.
   Jackson won about 95 percent of the black vote, which made up
about a quarter of the Democratic turnout, the ABC-Post, NBC and
CBS News-New York Times polls said. Jews and white Catholics each
made up about 25 percent of the total as well.
   ``The Jewish and black cancel each other out, then the ethnic
Catholic white vote is an important balance,'' said pollster I.A.
Lewis of the Los Angeles Times. ``It is going very strongly for
Dukakis.''
   Racial and religious antipathy marked the primary race _ Mayor
Edward I. Koch said Jews would ``have to be crazy'' to support
Jackson because of his position on Israel _ and polls indicated
that bad blood lingered.
   In early results from the Los Angeles Times exit poll, nearly
two-thirds of the Democratic voters said they believed there was
``an element of racism involved in the vote against Jackson,''
while about another third said they believed Jackson is
anti-Semitic.
   ``There's a very strong racial element here _ bitter racial
antagonism, I'd say,'' Lewis said.
   ABC News pollster Doug Muzzio called it ``a dual electorate'' in
which Dukakis won every demographic and socioeconomic group when
blacks were factored out.
   ``It's the same old song: Blacks voting overwhelmingly for
Jackson, whites less monolithic, but still, in this case, solidly
for Dukakis,'' he said.
   The NBC News poll said Jackson won just 18 percent of the
non-Jewish white vote; ABC had it at roughly one-fifth, which would
be about the same he got in the last two primaries, Wisconsin and
Connecticut. Among all whites, Jews included, the polls had Jackson
with about 15 percent.
   As expected, black turnout was highest in New York City,
accounting for 34 percent of the total in the NBC News poll.
   Muzzio noted ``an element of negative voting'' in the returns;
about a fifth of the voters said they were casting their ballots to
stop a candidate from winning rather than to help a candidate they
liked. Three-quarters of those negative voters went for Dukakis, he
said.
   There was some weakness in the support for Dukakis; NBC's poll
said more than half his supporters wished someone else were
running, and the CBS-Times poll said 72 percent of Dukakis' voters
said they would have voted for Gov. Mario Cuomo if he had been in
the race.
   Moreover, ``Only one in five blacks tells us that Dukakis really
cares about people like them, and only three in 10 blacks have a
favorable view of Dukakis,'' said NBC News poll chief Laurily
Epstein. ``So he's got his work cut out in that community.''
   Late pre-election polls gave Dukakis a lead of 9 points or more,
but pollsters stressed that turnout was the key _ chiefly, whether
non-Jewish whites would turn out and boost Dukakis or weaken him by
staying home.
   Fully one-third of the voters told NBC they had made their
decision in the last seven days of the race; 57 percent of them
went for Dukakis, 23 percent for Jackson and 19 percent for Gore.
   Most of Jackson's voters _ 70 percent _ made up their minds more
than a month ago, and 80 percent backed him strongly, NBC said. But
only half of his supporters said they thought the nation was ready
to elect a black president.
   NBC said liberal voters went for Jackson by a slim margin, 48
percent to 44 percent for Dukakis. Liberals made up 44 percent of
the total, the poll said. Moderates, a third of the total, favored
Dukakis over Jackson by 56-31; conservatives, 12 percent of the
total, split 56-23.
   Jackson did better with younger voters, the polls said, Dukakis
better with the older. Those most concerned with issues such as
drug abuse or helping the poor and elderly backed Jackson; those
concerned with the federal deficit and experience in office favored
Dukakis.
   Pre-election polls never showed much movement toward Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee; his peak was 12 percent in a CBS poll late
last week, after his endorsement by Koch. He did best among
conservative Democrats, the CBS-Times poll said, but was third even
there to Dukakis and Jackson.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. said ``I guess this was
somebody else's Super Tuesday'' as New Yorkers turned thumbs down
on his candidacy and he considered quitting the Democratic
presidential race.
   Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter, a close friend and adviser, said
the senator was weighing an end to his campaign after six weeks
without a primary or caucus win. Gore scheduled an announcement
Thursday.
   ``I told him he should gracefully get out and let this one
conclude,'' McWherter said from Nashville, Tenn.
   McWherter said, ``I've always been a person when reality rears
its head, recognize it, but do it gracefully and then go get a shoe
shine.''
   Gore spokesman Arlie Schardt told reporters here, ``I know the
senator hasn't made up his own mind. He has to talk to his advisers
and close friends.''
   But Gore dropped his attack stance of late and sounded a call
for unity as he spoke to supporters in New York, where he finished
a dismal third.
   ``I guess this was somebody else's Super Tuesday,'' he said. ``I
want to congratulate Mike Dukakis for a really impressive victory.
New York is a real marathon and he beat us by a mile. And I want to
congratulate Jesse Jackson for another tremendous showing. I never
wanted to stop Mike Dukakis or stop Jesse Jackson. I just wanted to
start Al Gore.
   ``Here in New York, and all across this country, in November,
the Democratic Party's going to be unified and we're going to stop
George Bush this November.''
   Gore called McWherter from New York where he was awaiting the
results of that state's presidential primary.
   ``He told me things were not good in New York. I told him to use
his own judgement,'' said McWherter, who coordinated Gore's
Southern campaign for Super Tuesday.
   McWherter declined to say whether Gore will drop out or not.
   ``Al Gore has worked hard for a year, and I don't think he needs
a big fat governor making the announcement for him,'' he said.
   ``I need to let him make that decision. I should not make any
suggestions of what he plans to do,'' McWherter said.
   In Ohio, Gore state director Rob Mulligan said national campaign
officials were reviewing the returns from New York before making a
decision.
   ``What I've been told is the campaign will see what it looks
like tonight and the senator will talk to his advisers to see what
direction the campaign will take,'' Mulligan said.

   A fragmentation grenade blew up
outside the American-Costa Rican Cultural Center Tuesday, wounding
two Americans and four other people, Costa Rican authorities said.
   Red Cross officials identified the Americans as Alice Feister, a
professor at the Cultural Center from the Washington, D.C. area,
and Shelly Bartain, a student from California.
   Feister was seriously wounded, but ``she's expected to pull
through,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Mark Krischick.
   Krischick said earlier Tuesday that the explosion was believed
caused by a malfunctioning power line transformer.
   A preliminary report prepared by the Intelligence and Security
Directorate said the explosion was caused by a fragmentation
grenade. Three cars were damaged, the report said.
   Hernan Garron, the public security minister, told The Associated
Press officials had no suspects in the incident. He called the
explosion ``a terrorist act.''
   Garron said the grenade apparently was thrown onto a sidewalk
near the Cultural Center.
   It may have been gone off underneath a car, one of the three
automobiles parked near the complex that were heavily damaged.
   Jorge Luis Alate, an explosives expert with the Security
Ministry, said the device appeared to be an M-67 fragmentation
grenade, capable of inflicting serious damage within a 100-yard
range.
   Police said they had no witnesses. One person, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said he was near the site, heard a loud
explosion and later saw a cloud in the vicinity of the Cultural
Center. He said one person next to the nearby Anglo-American school
appeared to have been hurt by the blast.
   Krischick said Feister suffered a severe artery wound and was
operated on immediately at Calderon Guardia Hospital. She was
reported in fair condition. Bartain suffered head and knee
lacerations but was said to be in good condition. She was expected
to return to the United States on Wednesday, a doctor at the
hospital said. Her hometown was not immediately available.
   Krischick said Tuesday evening that U.S. officials had been
unable to confirm that the explosion was caused by a grenade.
However, he noted Costa Rican officials ``were collecting evidence
all day.''
   ``We haven't had the opportunity to review the evidence,''
Krischick said. ``We will continue to review the situation.''
   The spokesman, contacted by telephone, said the explosion
occurred shortly after 8 a.m. (6 a.m.EDT) about 50 yards south of
the cultural center building in the eastern Los Yoses district. The
structure was not damaged, he said.
   President Oscar Arias visited the injured in the hospital and
later condemned the incident. ``This country, which is a haven of
peace, one day could turn into a Costa Rica invaded by terrorism
and violence if we don't adopt energetic measures to prevent it.''
   The explosion follows an attack on the U.S. Consulate in
Honduras April 7 by students enraged by the forced extradition of a
suspected drug dealer to the United States.

   District of Columbia Police Chief Maurice
Turner said Tuesday he won't halt neighborhood anti-drug patrols
despite an incident in which followers of Muslim leader Louis
Farrakhan allegedly assaulted a suspected drug dealer.
   Members of the Nation of Islam, a group led by Farrakhan, had
been summoned by frustrated residents of a neighborhood surrounding
what police call one of the city's most notorious open-air drug
marts.
   On Monday, according to police, a handful of Farrakhan followers
conducting an anti-drug patrol confronted a suspected drug dealer
outside an apartment complex.
   The group allegedly beat the man after he produced a sawed-off
shotgun, and beat a television reporter and cameraman when the two
refused to turn over their film of the incident.
   Turner said that in spite of Monday's violence, his department
had no intention of preventing members of the Nation of Islam from
resuming their patrols.
   ``We're not going to do anything to restrict their activities,''
said Turner. ``Obviously, what occurred yesterday was not within
the framework of the law. There were law violations that occurred,
and we are investigating.''
   A man identified as a Nation of Islam member, Maurice
Merriweather, 32, of Washington, originally was charged with two
counts of simple assault and one count of theft but the charges
were changed Tuesday to one count of robbery in connection with the
taking of a television camera.
   The suspected drug dealer, 25-year-old Clinton Carroll, was
listed in stable condition at D.C. General Hospital, while the
reporter, Joe Johns of WRC-TV, was treated and released from Sibley
Hospital.
   ``They were in hot pursuit of a news story, and we were in hot
pursuit of a drug pusher,'' said Abdul Alim-Mohammed, a Nation of
Islam spokesman. ``We apologize.''
   Turner, who previously has said that he wants to train civilians
to become part-time reserves to help his officers fight crime,
pledged to talk with the group to iron out rules of conduct.
   ``We do not want them taking the law into their own hands,'' he
said. ``We have to work within the realm of the law.''
   According to police records, there were more than 1,300 adults
and 67 juveniles arrested on drug charges in 1987 at the Mayfair
Mansions apartment complex where Monday's incident occurred.

   Contra leaders Tuesday held out little hope that a
peace agreement with the Sandinistas could be reached within the
60-day timetable established March 23 but hailed the first round of
talks as a ``triumph.''
   The Contra directors returned from Managua on Monday night after
three days of peace negotiations with the Sandinista government.
The two sides did not reach an agreement but decided to meet again
for three days beginning April 28.
   ``What the Sandinista government wants is an absence of war
without eliminating the causes of war,'' said Adolfo Calero, one of
the five directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance, as the rebels are
formally called.
   He said the Contras will continue to insist on steps toward
democracy before they agree to lay down their arms.
   But he and directors Alfredo Cesar and Pedro Joaquin Chamorro
Jr. hailed the visit itself as a victory, pointing out the
Sandinistas originally refused to meet face to face.
   ``Our arrival in Managua after everything the Sandinistas said
was a triumph,'' said Calero.
   ``The resistance is creating a unique precedent in Latin
America,'' said Cesar. ``We are an intact guerrilla force
negotiating in the capital without giving up our troops or our
arms.''
   There are difficult problems to solve before the negotiations
can be completed, the Contra leaders said, saying the timetable
agreed to in Sapoa, Nicaragua, last month probably cannot be met
and will be extended.
   He dismissed questions about the Sandinistas' sincerity, saying
they had no choice but to negotiate because their political
position inside Nicaragua was weak.
   Calero noted that when the rebels toured the capital's streets
in a small bus, Nicaraguans cheered, saluted and flashed them ``V''
signs.

   The number of full-blown AIDS cases in the
world is likely to increase fivefold in the next three years, and
hundreds of millions of people probably engage in activity that
leaves them vulnerable, says the head of the World Health
Organization's AIDS program.
   ``While it has become fashionable to reassure and state that
AIDS will never threaten large populations, we believe that
virology, immunology, sociology and epidemiology require us to take
the long view, and a more somber view,'' Dr. Jonathan Mann told the
White House AIDS commission Monday.
   ``Let us remember that we are still in the early phases of a
global epidemic whose first decade gives us every rational reason
for concern about the global future of AIDS,'' he said. ``HIV (the
AIDS virus) does not need to spread rapidly in a population to have
a tremendous and gradually expanding cumulative effect.''

   The findings were released Monday amid the Federal Aviation
Administration's detailed inspection effort aimed at two of the
country's largest airlines _ Continental and Eastern _ and a broad

   The presidential panel called on the FAA to hire additional

airlines as well as giving priority to airlines that are undergoing

   Olson's death from cancer Monday at age 62 came just two days

executive was reported ill with flu.
   Allen, 53, who will field questions at the annual meeting, is

   Analysts say Allen was being groomed to succeed Olson as

board of directors, which might make a decision this week.

<TEXT>
   Arvind Kumar should be the envy of most
book publishers.
   As director of India's National Book Trust, 44-year-old Kumar
heads an organization with a potential market of 283 million
Indians.
   But not too many would like to work Kumar's seven-day week as he
tries to juggle 13 Indian languages and keep ahead of critics who
say the trust publishes too few books in any one of them.
   The trust was set up in 1957 to produce and encourage the
production of good literature at moderate prices _ a sweeping
objective considering the size of the reading public and the
diversity of languages.
   India's 800 million people speak more than 1,600 dialects, and
15 languages are listed as official in the country's constitution.
The 13 in which the trust publishes rant state.
   Some of India's languages, little known outside the country, are
spoken by more people than some European tongues. Sixty million
people speak Marathi and 62 million Telegu, almost as many as the
63 million people who speak Italian in Italy and far more than the
11 million who speak Greek or the 9 million in Sweden who speak
that language.
   The trust's translations of Indian works include such books as
``Tin Malayalam Natak'' and the Punjabi version of ``Three
Malayalam Plays,'' set in the shady jungles of Kerala.
   The translation involves a change in script _ India's languages
also are written in 13 different scripts _ and sees the book
traveling 1,240 miles north to the dusty plains of Punjab where,
Kumar says, it is doing good business.
   Good business because the Punjabi translation adds 14 million
potential buyers to the 22 million Malayalam-speaking population. A
translation of a book from any other Indian language to Hindi, the
national language, adds 153 million people to the potential market.
   The trust has recently published a book of Punjabi folk tales in
Urdu, the Telugu novel ``What Was Left'' in Punjabi and the Hindi
novel ``Darkness'' in Urdu, Gujarati, Marathi and Tamil. The story
about India's partition became a popular TV series.
   The trust also publishes many books in English which, though not
an official Indian language, is spoken by most educated Indians.
These range from historical works such as a biography of Guru
Nanak, the first prophet of India's Sikh faith, to books about
India's rivers, its Hindu temples and its orchids.
   Despite its exotic output, the trust has received severe
criticism. A government committee complained the organization had
published only 3,101 books since 1957 and has spent most of its
funds on staff salaries. The trust receives a $3 million grant from
the government.
   ``There were heavy losses due to underpricing and incorrect
pricing of its publications,'' the government review said.
   Kumar agrees but only in part. He says more books should have
been published and he is planning a 70 percent increase in
production this year which would add 250 titles.
   ``But we are not a commercial enterprise,'' he says. ``There
will be losses because the books are underpriced as per government
orders.''
   The increase in production, Kumar says, is only a token effort
to tackle the problem: ``It's like a few drops of rain in a
desert.''
   Most of the additional titles will be in English and Hindi. But
efforts will be made to increase translations into other Indian
languages for what Kumar calls ``unifying the country through
literature.''
   Language has been a prickly subject in India. Riots have broken
out in south India over what people view as the forcible imposition
of Hindi, which is mainly spoken in the country's north.
   The trust steers clear of potential disputes by appointing
advisory boards for each language to decide which books to publish.
   The trust's other responsibilities include participating in the
government's plans to make 80 million more Indians literate by
1995. This means providing books for primary schools and adult
education centers in more than 500 cities and towns. Only 35
percent of India's people can now read and write.
   But Kumar says the trust by itself cannot fulfill the
government's literacy campaign.
   ``We can support it but we cannot hug it too hard,'' he says.
``We cannot succeed on our own. We have to float on a current and

<HEAD>Remake of Hitchcock Classic Only Pale Copy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The idea of remaking Alfred Hitchcock's
psychological thriller ``Suspicion'' might one day prove
interesting, but the makers of the new version airing on PBS
tonight produced only a pointless replica.
   The new ``Suspicion,'' part of the PBS series ``American
Playhouse,'' stars Jane Curtin and Anthony Andrews in the Joan
Fontaine-Cary Grant roles.
   Except for a 1980s veneer, nothing is changed, including the
studio ending that Hitchcock said he deplored. So why didn't these
filmmakers do something daring like give the film the ending
Hitchcock said he wanted?
   ``Suspicion'' is the story of a dowdy young woman facing
spinsterhood who is swept off her feet by a handsome, ne'er-do-well
bachelor. She marries him, then begins to suspect he's a murderer
and that she's his next victim.
   Hitchcock masterfully kept audiences off balance, one minute
suggesting that charming Johnnie Aysgarth was indeed a killer, the
next revealing him as nothing more than an irresponsible
spendthrift, his crimes a figment of his wife's imagination.
Whether they were or not was the bone of contention between Hitch
and the studio.
   It's hard to evaluate Curtin's and Andrews' performances, since
they speak the same lines as Grant and Fontaine.
   For instance, when Johnnie crashes a party, causing his
unwilling host to sputter, ``I don't know what to say,'' he
responds coolly, ``I suggest you say something, old boy, before you
embarrass this man (indicating a butler) to death.'' No matter how
good Andrews is, it's Cary Grant's line.
   Curtin's Lina never seems to connect convincingly with Johnnie.
Fontaine won an Oscar for the role in which she alternately feared
and adored her handsome husband.
   Curtin's husband, Patrick Lynch, co-produced the movie with
Barry Levinson (a British filmmaker, not the American director of
``Tin Men''). Andrew Grieve, another Briton, directed by taking no
chances.
   Levinson and screenwriter Jonathan Lynn (``The Internecine
Project'') adapted the 1941 script by Samuel Raphaelson, Joan
Harrison and Alma Reville. But almost nothing is changed from the
Hitchcock version save minor details, such as Sarah, a secretary,
in lieu of Emily, the maid.
   Even Lynn's performance as Beaky, Johnnie's good-time friend,
seems an impersonation of Nigel Bruce in the original.
   The movie was based on a novel, ``Before the Fact,'' written by
Anthony Berkeley Cox under the pseudonym Francis Iles. In the
novel, the husband really is a murderer, and his wife, after
learning she is pregnant, willingly drinks the poisoned milk he
serves her to keep him from procreating.
   According to Hitchcock biographer Donald Spoto, RKO Pictures
refused to let the intended star at the time, Laurence Olivier,
play a killer. Hitchcock offered to produce a script as a study of
paranoid fantasy. After delays, Grant and Fontaine eventually were
cast in the lead roles.
   As the shooting dragged on _ Hitchcock became ill at one point _
many endings were written and more than one was filmed.
   When studio censors objected to pregnant Fontaine willingly
taking poison, Hitchcock added scenes suggesting she'd had an
illicit affair, since it was OK for a character to commit suicide
if the character had sinned. But a preview audience laughed at the
scenes, according to Spoto. In another unused ending, Johnnie
redeemed himself by joining the Royal Air Force.
   For the original ``Suspicion'' climax, Hitchcock filmed Grant
and Fontaine struggling in a speeding car by putting them on a
soundstage with a moving backdrop. Grieve was able to shoot the
scene using a real car on a real road on location in Cornwall,
England. Such technical updating turns out to add nothing when
compared to the original.
   One bow to the '80s: Before the harrowing car ride, Curtin notes
her seatbelt is broken, a problem Fontaine didn't mention in 1941.

<HEAD>When Interest Rates Rise, Should You Sell Stocks?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's a wise old saying that when interest
rates show signs of rising, it's a good time to consider moving
your investments from stocks to bonds.
   It may be one of those times now.
   Believing in the theory is one thing, but believing in it
strongly enough to make a basic investment change is a matter of a
vastly different magnitude, since commissions and steep capital
gains taxes could be involved.
   Still, since the theory seems to make sense, the temptation is
there.
   When interest rates rise, the returns from bonds become
relatively more attractive. As investors shift, the prices of
stocks tend to become depressed. And as rates rise, corporate
earnings may fall, depressing stocks further.
   Gerald Perritt, a former DePaul University professor and current
president and editor of the newsletter Investment Horizons, is
among those who wondered if reality performed according to theory,
and so he put the theory to the test.
   Using changes in the prime interest rate as a guide _ it was an
arbitrary decision; others measures could have been used _ he
traced the stock market's reactions from March 25, 1970.
   For experimental purposes, he assumed that on that date a 100
percent commitment was made to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock
index and maintained until May 11, 1971, when the prime rate rose
to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent.
   The commitment was then sold, and no stock investments were made
until October 20, 1971, when the prime rate fell to 5.75 percent
from 6 percent.
   Thereafter, he sold when the prime rose and bought when it fell.
   The result: A 462 percent gain in value, dividends excluded,
which is more than double the 196 percent capital appreciation
earned on a buy-and-hold strategy employed over the entire period.
   He concludes: ``Even if commissions and income taxes are
accounted for, the prime rate portfolio readjustment strategy
yields a significantly higher overall rate of return relative to
implementation of a buy-and-hold strategy.''
   But the story doesn't end there. In fact, a very big question
arises: What might have happened if you weren't able to hold the
portfolio intact for that long period of time? What if you had
needed to cash in?
   Answer: You might not have done very well, since the strategy
would not have yielded the best results on all occasions.
   In fact, says Perritt, there were five periods when the strategy
would have placed the investor in the stock market during times of
declining stock prices.
   Similarly, on six occasions the strategy would have resulted in
the investor sitting on the sidelines during periods of rising
stock prices.
   Question: Would you, or most other investors, have been able to
follow a strategy that failed to work on so many occasions,
confident that over longer periods of time it would work out for
the best?
   Perritt concedes it would have taken extreme patience for
investors to have followed the theory, one of the reasons being it
would have kept them on the sidelines for periods as long as 25
months.
   And, he acknowledges, the one investment axiom that has long
stood the test of time is ``whatever has worked well in the past
will most likely not work continuously in the future.''
   Nevertheless, he expresses the opinion that ``history often
contains lessons which, if learned and practiced, can improve one's
well-being.''
   This, he believes, is the case with the historical relationship
between interest rates and stock market prices.

<BYLINE>All-American Methodists Seeking Their Idenity</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Often called the most typical of American
denominations, United Methodism detects a blurring of its identity
and is seeking to define it more clearly.
   That's an objective of the church's governing general
conference, which starts next Tuesday in St. Louis and has before
it proposed new summations of doctrine and mission.
   The 10,000-word doctrinal paper has stirred controversy,
suggesting that theology _ the heart of belief _ is going to be a
volatile topic of the 11-day meeting.
   Other issues, such has challenges to the 9.1-million-member
denomination's stand against homosexual practice and against
ordaining active homosexuals, have gained the most attention.
   But the proposed doctrinal exposition deals with the rudimentary
expression of the church's character.
   At issue is the document's backing away from previous strong
affirmations of diversity, or ``pluralism,'' in concepts and
approaches, a variety that some see as reflecting vagueness.
   The new doctrinal paper seeks ``to move away from glorification
of pluralism,''says the Rev. Richard Heitzenrater of Dallas, vice
chairman of the commission that prepared the document.
   But some contend it is too restrictive.
   ``We believe that the proposed substitute to our current
statement would move our church into a narrow sectarian and
repressive stance,'' says a group of about l00 clergy.
   Others, however, maintain the tightening up is needed to counter
a tendency toward ambiguity about belief.
   In any case, writes the Rev. Richard Neuhause of New York, a
Lutheran, a tradition strong on theology:
   ``Whatever happens, it is certain that within United Methodism
today there is a seriousness about theology and church doctrine
that did not exist a couple of years ago.
   ``That in itself is a most promising sign.''
   Generally considered the most representative of American
denominations, Methodism took root at the country's origins, and
moved west with the population, with Methodist circuit-riders
common on the American froniter.
   The church is spread through all sections of the country, both
rural and urban. Mostly middle class, it has only about 4 percent
ethnic minority members, although it lately has emphasized ministry
to them.
   The denomination initially arose in England under John Wesley's
leadership with a special mission _ to serve the working classes
and socially neglected. Wesley's spirit-filled verve, not doctrinal
exactitude, marked the movemenmt.
   Methodism retains much of its socially activist urge. But the
scene now has changed, become more complex in a multi-cultural
nation, and some say the church's vision and direction have clouded.
   Two scholars of Methodist-related Duke University Divinity
School maintain that the denomination, the nation's second largest
Protestant body next to Southern Baptists, is no longer just one
church, but seven of them.
   In a 1985 study, ``The Seven Churches of Methodism,'' professors
Robert L. Wilson and William H. Willimon say regionalism
characterizes the denomination rather than any overall cohesion.
   ``Regional differences are a fact of life, and unless church
leaders recognize and deal with those tensions, any attempts to
have homogeneous ministries will be imposssible,'' says
sociologist-researcher Wilson.
   He and Willimon say the denomination now consists of these seven
``churches'':
   The New England ``Yankee church,'' declining and absorbed in
ecclesiastical tinkering; the ``Industrial Northeast'' church, once
strong, but retreating to small towns; the ``Midwest Church,''
still a stable stronghold, the ``Church South,'' conservative and
cohesive; the ``Southwest Church,'' lively and fastest growing, the
``Frontier Church'' still with a frontier spirit, and ``the Western
Church,'' something of an enigmatic mixture.
   The denomination, second largest in the nation next to Southern
Baptists and Roman Catholics, emphasizes its variety in its present
doctrinal statement, adopted in 1972, saying:
   The ``theological spectrum ranges over all the current
mainstream options and a variety of special-interest theologies''
and the church sees ``positive virtues of doctrinal pluralism even
within the same community of believers...
   ``The viability of all doctrinal opinion demands that the
processes of theological development must be kept open-ended.''
   In the proposed new doctrinal statement, developed in four years
of work by a 22-member committee, puts the emphasis on Scripture as
``the primary source and criterion for authentic Christian truth
and witness.''
   The other three guides that Wesley put alongside Scripture _
tradition, experience and reason _ are described as aiding in
grasping the meaning of Scripture, subordinate to it.
   ``United Methodists as a diverse people continue to strive for
consensus in understanding the gospel,'' the document says. ``Our
task is to articulate our vision in a way that will draw us
together as a people in mission.
   ``In the name of Jesus Christ we are called to work within our
diversity while exercising patience and forebearance with one
another.''

   After the United Methodist Publishing House
cancelled plans to publish a book by a bishop advocating relaxed
sexual views, it was snapped up by a major commercial publisher,
Harper & Row.
   The author, Episcopal Bishop John Shelby Spong of Newark, N.J.,
voiced delight at the outcome.
   He said the Methodist publisher, Abingdon Press, had
commissioned the book, but was ``so intimidated by reactionary
critics'' that it backed out of the project only a month before
publication.
   However, Harper & Row said it would keep that schedule, issuing
Spong's ``Living in Sin? A Bishop Rethinks Human Sexuality,'' on
May 15. Spong suggests approving single adult sex relations and
homosexual unions.
   Abingdon says it dropped the book because of keen feelings about
sexual issues confronting the church's governing conference April
26-May 6. President Robert K. Feaster of Abingdon said it didn't
want to aggravate the controversy.
   Harper editor Clayton Carlson called the book prophetic, saying
its ``bold proposals'' will ``undoubtedly thunder on to the
discussion agendas of virtually every ecclesiastical institution.''

   Traffic to Cuba by U.S. church leaders has
swelled to a busy tempo, with New York's Roman Catholic Cardinal
John O'Connor making the latest ecclesiastical excursion to that
Communist state.
   In the previous week, the president of the National Council of
Churches, the Rev. Patricia McClurg, and the council's general
secretary, the Rev. Arie Brouwer, visited Cuban church leaders.
   That trip came shortly after another one by an interfaith team
of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, which reported the
situation for churches has improved.
   ``We want to keep a continuous dialogue with the churches of
Cuba,'' says Brouwer. ``Especially at this moment of openness, this
time of improvement between church and state in Cuba, we feel it's
important to be with the churches and be in dialogue with the Cuban
government.''

   What happens when one of the biggest grossing
movies of the season hits the home video market? The happy studio
that owns it makes sure there are enough copies available for sale
and rental and launches a $1 million advertising campaign.
   As if ``Beverly Hills Cop II'' would need much promotion.
   The movie, starring Eddie Murphy in a reprise of his role as a
hip and irreverent Detroit cop let loose in ever so chic and snotty
Beverly Hills, has raked in more than $153 million for Paramount
Pictures since its release in May 1987.
   According to Eric Doctorow, senior vice president and general
manager of Paramount Home Video, distributors, retailers and mail
order firms had already ordered over 500,000 videocassettes of the
movie by March.
   Avid Murphy fans, ignoring the dousing the movie received last
year from critics, are already lined up at video stores for copies
of ``Beverly Hills Cop II,'' available on VHS for $89.95 and Beta
for $29.95.
   Another Paramount megahit, ``The Untouchables,'' the Brian De
Palma gangland action thriller that won an Academy Award for Sean
Connery, is available on videocassette on April 20.
   The movie has grossed more than $76 million since its release
last year and is priced at $89.95 for VHS and $29.95 for Beta.
   Elsewhere, Vestron Video has announced that it will release a
video version of Jonathan Miller's Broadway production of Eugene
O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey Into Night.''
   Starring Jack Lemmon as the unbending family patriach James
Tyrone, Bethel Leslie, Peter Gallagher and Kevin Spacey, the VHS
video, priced at $59.98, will be available on June 22.
   Vestron will also release Hector Babenco's ``Ironweed'' in June.
Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by William Kennedy, the
movie won Oscar nominations for co-stars Meryl Streep and Jack
Nicholson.
   Videos reviewed this week:
   
   ``Beverly Hills Cop II'' (VHS _ $89.95, Beta _ $29.95, Rated R)
   
   Eddie Murphy is back as Axel Foley, tooling around undercover in
a red Ferrari as Detroit's answer to Sonny Crockett until the
shooting of his buddy Police Capt. Andrew Bogomil carries him back
to Beverly Hills.
   There he teams up with Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and Taggart
(John Ashton) to chase down a pack of gun smugglers, triggering a
non-stop round of shootouts, broken glass, squad car smash-ups and
exploding trucks.
   Anyone who has the sneaking feeling they've seen all this before
is right. Director Tony Scott (``Top Gun'') took the formula that
proved so successful the first time around and slapped it on film
again, chocking up 1987's biggest box-office winner in the process.
   Unfortunately, this version has more of everything except the
thing it needs most: Eddie Murphy being funny.
   The writers toss in some scraps of character development,
telling us that Bogomil has a daughter, Taggart has a divorce-happy
wife and Rosewood has a gun fetish. This go-round also has Rambo's
former squeeze, Brigitte Nielsen _ nostrils flared _ destroying
massive amounts of property without so much as smudging her makeup.
And it includes a gratuitous stop at the Playboy mansion where Hef
himself gets to say a few words, such as they are.
   There's an R-rating and lots of profanity. There's more noise
but less really graphic violence than the original; adolescent boys
probably would like it a lot.
   Diehard Murphy fans will want to catch his occasional funny
moments. For others, the laughs might prove too few and far between
to make this worth tolerating.

   ``Less Than Zero'' (CBS@Fox, VHS@Beta stereo, and available
closed captioned for the hearing impaired, $89.98, Rated R)
   
   Naming this movie ``Less Than Zero'' was a forfeit to critics:
Who among them could resist giving this dumb, sentimental Hollywood
version of Bret Easton Ellis' novel less than zero? The release of
the video provides another chance to give it one last kick in the
rump.
   The movie stars Andrew McCarthy, an attractive young guy whose
acting skills are unfortunately limited to a) smirking and b)
gawking. He plays Clay Easton, a reasonably grounded college
student who has come home for the holidays to find that his budding
bimbo girlfriend (Jami Gertz) has been consorting with an old
school chum (Robert Downey Jr.), who is busy flushing himself down
the tubes because of drugs.
   Ellis' book of the same title _ it has little else in common
with the movie _ was a declaration of insignificance, a scary
ramble through the lives of visionless, overprivileged, untended
youth. The book's pointlessness was its point. The movie is
immediately hobbled by a contrived good vs. evil plot. Even the
soundtrack is vapid with such tunes as the Bangles' remake of
``Hazy Shade of Winter.''
   Marek Kanievkska (``Another Country'') directed. The best thing
about the movie _ except for unintentional laughs _ is the
attractive photography of the high-style, minimalist Southern
California architecture. Unfortunately, nobody is home.

   ``The Pick-Up Artist'' (CBS@Fox Video, VHS@Beta, $89.98, Rated
PG-13)
   
   Meet Jack Jericho, a horny grade-school teacher who hits on
anything that moves and has more lines than Disneyland.
   Jack, played by Robert Downey Jr., was undoubtedly intended to
be a funny, endearing hero. Somehow, though, even Jack's kindness
to kids and his diabetic granny fail to save him from coming across
as a sleazy little jerk, a sort of human pimple on the face of
Manhattan womankind _ hard to get rid of and bound to pop up
somewhere else.
   That's what Randy Jensen discovers after she boggles Jack's mind
by giving him her body within moments of their first meeting but
refusing to give him her phone number. Is this woman hip and
liberated, or just cruising for a disease?
   Molly Ringwald's Randy is either sullen or whiny and sometimes
both, the perfect foil for the vacuous Jack, who spends the rest of
the movie mooning after her and scheming to help rustle up the
money her alcoholic father owes a drug-dealing thug.
   Dennis Hopper, as Randy's father, and Harvey Keitel, as the
thug, provide the only real mystery in this utterly predictable 81
minutes: How did these two excellent character actors get mixed up
in this insipid piece of celluloid?
   Little acting, even less action and lines such as, ``You know
what this cheeseburger is like? Life!'' make writer-director James
Toback's movie too moronic for adults and for those teen-agers
whose IQs are greater than their shoe size.

   ``Blow Up Your Video'' (Atlantic) _ AC@DC
   
   It may surprise those who lived through it, but the 1970s are
now regarded as a golden age for heavy metal rock. A glance at
magazine covers attests to Led Zeppelin's continued deification.
Aerosmith has returned to the charts and even Ted Nugent has a new
record in the stores.
   Australian hard rockers AC@DC hope their new ``Blow Up Your
Video'' album can return them to a place of prominence.
   It just might. Years on the road have taught this band that
sparkling originality is much less a prerequisite for heavy metal
success than a loud noise that packs a wallop.
   Angus Young may be looking more ridiculous every year in his
English schoolboy's outfit, but it probably reassures the kids that
he knows what they like. AC@DC delivers songs of alienation and
macho posturing with muscle.
   ``Blow Up Your Video'' has a series of solid riffs, even though
some sound a little too familiar. With ``That's the Way I Wanna
Rock 'n' Roll,'' AC@DC joins a long list of Led Zeppelin immitators.
   ``Heatseeker'' is the kind of good-time rocker that could become
an anthem for teen-aged boys out looking for girls or trouble, or
both. ``This Means War,'' with a rhythm that shifts into overdrive,
is a headbanger's delight.
   The remainder of the songs falls into that great mass of metal
that all tends to sound the same after awhile. At least AC@DC has
the sense to avoid turgid ballads. Brian Johnson's voice never gets
lower than a howl, or occasional growl.
   ``Highway to Hell'' and ``Back in Black'' have always been
considered AC@DC's peaks. ``Blow Up Your Video'' won't cause any
reassessments, but the band isn't ready for a rest home of 1970s
stars.

   ``Dancing in the Dark'' (Milestone) _ Sonny Rollins
   
   In his first studio date in four years, Sonny Rollins once again
seduces us with his sweet and swinging tenor saxophone.
   There are several new compositions by the jazz vituoso on
``Dancing in the Dark,'' which blends calypso, pop, reggae and
bebop.
   His ballad, ``Promise,'' is a lovely tune that allows him some
lyrical riffs with the sax. Another ballad, ``Just Once,'' made
popular by James Ingram years ago, is a good stab at contemporary
pop. Rollins' ``Duke of Iron'' is pure Trinidadian calypso fun.
   ``Dancing in the Dark'' opens with a lovely sax solo by Rollins,
and illuminates all the right romantic licks of the Arthur
Schwartz-Howard Dietz 1930s hit that was first introduced in the
revue, ``The Band Wagon.''
   Another '30s hit, Harry Warren's ``I'll String Along With You,''
has been rearranged by Rollins into a reggae beat. It is part of
Rollins' artistry that always stretches to do something just a
little different _ to keep jazz not only traditional but fresh
without selling out to fusion.
   As a jazzman and all-around musician, Rollins shines on
``Dancing in the Dark,'' demonstrating his mastery of bebop,
melodic ballads, toe-tapping dance tunes and music just to kick
back with.

<HEAD>Star Watch: The Always Prepared Olivia de Havilland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veteran actress Olivia de Havilland believes
that preparation is the key to success in everything. It partly
explains why she kept a cool head during the pre-Academy Award
gridlock while others around her were losing theirs.
   The scene around the Shrine Auditorium on the afternoon of April
11 was one of panic: bumper-to-bumper limos in all directions;
nominees Meryl Streep and Glenn Close (nine months pregnant)
abandoned their limos to tramp down the city streets in their
evening gowns.
   So did Olivia de Havilland. But unlike scores of others in the
same plight, she exhibited her customary Melanie-like calm.
   ``One limousine after another disgorged its passengers,'' she
recalled with a lilting laugh. ``There was a whole parade of people
in black tie and evening dress striding along, and I wish you could
have seen the bemused households along the way. They stood there
not believing what they were looking at: this marvelous procession.
Out came a few discreet cameras, snapping the spectacle.
   ``One sight I thought very droll: These stretch limousines look
very invincible, the white ones especially, but there was one of
them in the most undignified position, with its nose up in the air,
resting on a tow truck.''
   Miss de Havilland arrived at the Shrine on time _ she was the
third presenter and recipient of a standing ovation. The reason for
her calm, she said, was preparation.
   ``I went down to the Shrine twice on Friday and for the
run-through on Saturday,'' she said. ``I wanted to be sure where
everything was. There were numerous details you needed to know for
things to go smoothly. Thank heaven I did.
   ``Walking the eight blocks, my dress had to be held, and the
sensitive material crumpled. I knew exactly where the wardrobe was.
I needed powdering, and I knew where the makeup was. I also knew
the number of my table (at the Board of Governors Ball), and I
think we were the first to be seated.''
   What was her reaction to best actress Cher's revealing
appearance?
   ``Oh, I think she's such a rascal,'' Miss de Havilland said
amusedly. ``She has the most beautiful figure in the world, and a
marvelous face. I must say I thought she was wearing black velvet.
Then I realized she was just wearing lace _ and nothing else! I let
out a gasp, and then I thought, `Oh, isn't she funny. She put that
on just to make people do that.'''
   The Shrine Auditorium held special significance for Miss de
Havilland. Forty-two years ago on the same stage she won her first
Academy Award as best actress for ``To Each His Own.'' Three years
later she collected her second Oscar for ``The Heiress.''
   The name Olivia de Havilland evokes a flood of memories for
anyone familiar with films. She would be an icon if she had made
only one movie: the eternal ``Gone With the Wind.'' However, she is
famed for much more, from ``A Midsummer's Night Dream'' to ``Hush
... Hush, Sweet Charlotte.''
   She has been a star since 1934, when she arrived in Hollywood as
a 17-year-old from Northern California. She and her sister, actress
Joan Fontaine, were born in Tokyo. She co-starred seven times with
Errol Flynn, romanced with Howard Hughes and John Huston, feuded
with her sister, married novelist Marcus Goodrich who was 18 years
her senior. The marriage resulted in son Benjamin and divorce.
Daughter Gisele was born from the marriage to French magazine
editor Pierre Galante. They were divorced in 1979.
   While she reveres her Hollywood past, that's not where she
lives. Strikingly beautiful at 71, she is very much a woman of
today. Her home remains an elegant townhouse near the Bois de
Bologne in Paris, but she travels to locations for such TV movies
as ``Anastasia'' and this month's ``The Woman He Loved.''
   The actress is now becoming acquainted with the world of rock
music since her daughter became engaged to French pop idol Johnny
Halliday.
   ``He is a national institution,'' Miss de Havilland marveled
about the singer, who is 13 years older than Gisele.
   ``I saw him and Gisele just before I left, and I said, `You'll
have to excuse me, but I have to start being very informed.' I
asked, from his point of view, the most inane question: `What is
the difference between a mandolin and a guitar?' He was very polite
about it.'''
   The thought of Melanie Wilkes attending a rock concert may seem
bizarre, but it happened. While she was filming ``The Woman He
Loved'' in Villefranche, the producer arranged a three-hour drive
so she could attend a Halliday concert in Marseilles. She sat with
Giselle up front next to the sound and light controls.
   ``Gisele was very anxious to see how her mother would react to a
rock concert,'' the actress said. ``I had never attended one. Very
soon after the music began, it's such an impelling rhythm that I
found myself going (knees bobbing) and my feet started to tap away.
I could not keep still.''
   After the concert, Halliday, Gisele and Miss de Havilland were
taken by motorcycle-escorted limousine to a quiet bistro.
   ``That was the night he asked me for Gisele's hand,'' the
actress said. ``I was startled because it was only the second time
I had met him. I said, `W... w... well... yes.'''

<HEAD>The Artists: Italians Examine Past With Phoenician Exhibit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS REDMONT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italians have launched into a wide-scale
introspection of their past with the largest exhibit ever assembled
on the Phoenicians, the ancient traders who colonized the
Mediterranean and created the basis of the modern alphabet.
   New books, public debates, magazines articles, TV documentaries,
T-shirts, imitation jewelry and greeting cards help celebrate a
$6.5 million exhibit which has attracted record crowds and started
to correct some of the fallacies spread against the Phoenicians.
   ``Because history is always written by the conquerors and never
by those vanquished, the Phoenicians went down as the bad guys, the
most hated people in the ancient times,'' said Sabatineo Moscati,
the archaeologist who assembled the exhibit at Venice's 18th
century Palazzo Grassi.
   ``For centuries they were believed to be infant-killers, sharp
and dishonest traders, pirates and kidnappers,'' he said. ``The
commercial and military power of Carthage (Phoenician for the New
Town) turned them into the rivals of the Romans, who systematically
destroyed them in 146 B.C. after trouncing Hannibal and his
elephants.''
   Moscati's exhibit brings together archeological discoveries
unearthed since 1960 in the first attempt at a definitive public
study of the Phoenicians and their world. It stretched from Lebanon
to Spain, and included forays as far as England and even around the
tip of Africa.
   Model galleys float their way across a large indoor pool, while
a huge plaster wave looms in the background. At the entrance,
tablets, graves and sarcophagi poke out of large sand dunes with
their lids open, as if to invite visitors to raise a civilization
from the dead.
   One room displays piles of almonds, nuts, spices, flower petals
and dyes, emulating a Phoenician market place. And on the walls
overlooking more than 1,200 objects on display from museums and
collections in 11 countries, there are painted quotations from
ancient sources, including the Old Testament, and recent authors.
   The Phoenicians emerged as a historically recognizable society
around 1200 B.C. in what is now Lebanon. Their history encompasses
the pre-Christian millenium from the Old Testament's Canaan to the
Punic Wars between Rome and Carthage.
   The Phoenicians are generally credited with the invention of the
alphabet, changing symbols to phonetic signs. ``Alph,'' originally
in the shape of an ox's head, meant ox, while ``beth'' was a
schematic square floor plan and meant house. Phoenician letters
that turned into present-day usage included: ``M,'' a wavy line
representing water; ``N,'' a slithering snake; and ``H,'' a man
with his arms raised in jubilation.
   Phoenician cities spread over the Mediterranean from Tyre and
Sidon, to Carthage, Sardinia, Sicily, Spain and Portugal. They were
the only people capable of making a highly prized purple dye called
phoinix _ which gave them their name _ from a murex shell, which
was reserved only to Byzantine emperors and their families.
   According to the ancient historian Herodotus, Phoenician
navigators are believed to have sailed around Africa over 2,000
years before the Portuguese explorers because they reported the
midday sun stood in the North instead of the South.
   ``The Phoenicians were the real inventors of private enterprise,
foreign trade and door-to-door sales,'' economist Mario
Salvatorelli said. ``They would drop off their salesmen in various
ports, let them fan out toward the interior and pick them up on the
way back with what they had bartered. They also acted as the
wholesale movers for other parties and created the ancestor of
today's container _ enormous pitchers in which they moved dyes and
other liquids.''
   Phoenician craftsmen sent by King Hyram of Tyre were said to
have built Solomon's temple in Jerusalem.
   While modern discoveries showed that Egyptians and not
Phoenicians had discovered glass, the traders developed an entire
industry based on glass. Incense burners, perfume bottles and
delicate blue and white necklaces and bracelets grace the exhibit
cases.
   ``The talents of the Phoenicians are much closer to what
Italians are like today than is commonly believed,'' Salvatorelli
said.
   Although Saint Augustine reported that Punic books contained
``many wise things,'' the only existing Phoenician writing today is
a treatise on agriculture translated into Latin. And since they
left so few records of themselves, the little that is known about
them recently was written by other nations.
   One of the mysteries Moscati claims to have solved regards
charges by ancient writers that Phoenicians threw newborn babies
into the flames as a sacrifice to the gods. However, new finds and
scientific analysis show that the babies' ``sanctuaries'' were
places for sacred cremation of already dead babies or fetuses.
   ``There still remains much of the Phoenician world to
discover,'' Moscati said. ``Countries like Algeria and Morocco have
not really been explored. And in Lebanon, everything is at a
standstill.''
   ``But in the meantime the biggest surprise for the Italians has
been to discover how widespread the Phoenician colonization was on
their territory. Besides most of their emporia on the continental
coast, one-third of Sicily and all of Sardinia was in their hands.''
   The exhibit closes Nov. 6.

<HEAD>Music Makers: More Talking Heads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Byrne was in a hotel bathtub in
Minneapolis when he wrote lyrics for ``No More Flowers'' for the
Talking Heads.
   This is just one bare fact the group revealed when talking about
themselves in an interview to promote their latest LP, ``Naked.''
   Byrne, the group's lead singer and lyricist, was in Minneapolis
to visit his wife, costume designer Adele Lutz, who was doing a
play there.
   ``I would work with this microcassette recorder,'' he said. ``I
would have it sitting just outside the tub. I would reach out and
speak into it. I'd be singing in the tub. I'd catch a phrase that I
thought was apropos; I'd put it on the little recorder.''
   The album is on their new label, Fly Records. It jumped onto
Cashbox magazine's best-selling album chart at No. 20 on April 2.
   ``This record actually goes back to our earliest songs and
albums `Remain in Light' (1980) and `Speaking in Tongues' (1983),
where we would each contribute ideas,'' said drummer Chris Frantz.
   ``We rented a rehearsal studio in New York and each threw out
ideas. We had a little cassette recorder and had all our
instruments there. We'd take an idea, play it and play it, trading
instruments, until it fell apart. Then we'd strike up a new idea.
We ended up after 10 days with many snippets of songs.
   ``We went to Paris into a recording studio and commenced to put
them all together into song form.''
   They went to Paris for several reasons. They laid down tracks
with Paris-based Third-World musicians who play Caribbean Zuok and
Algerian-Moroccan rai. Frantz said they also wanted to hang out
together, which they're more apt to do in Paris than in New York
where they have different sets of friends.
   ``My feeling is that lately there has been less openness here,''
said Byrne, the group's lead singer and lyricist. ``I wanted to get
away from that feeling. There is that kind of vibe here that
whatever is Top 10 in the United States is all there is. There is a
lot going on in other places.''
   Byrne, Frantz and Tina Weymouth met at the Rhode Island School
of Design, and still design their striking album packages. They
added Jerry Harrison to the trio and put out their first album in
1977.
   Wally Badarou, who played keyboards on ``Speaking in Tongues,''
found the Paris studio and brought in other musicians.
   ``One guitarist had a big smile the entire time he was playing
with us,'' Weymouth said. ``When you're putting down music with
that kind of heartfelt feeling, you know it's coming across in the
record.''
   Harrison said the album has two moods. ``This organic, larger
band is primarily on the first side of the album,'' he said. What
Weymouth terms ``the more experimental or ominous'' songs are on
Side 2.
   After 15 basic tracks were recorded, Byrne improvised melodies
and then wrote the words.
   ``I heard a story about a French screenwriter who, when it was
time to write a script, would rent a hotel room at the Rafael and
lock himself in the bathroom,'' Byrne said. ``His secretary would
deliver food. He didn't allow himself to go out of there until it
was all done. He could barely afford to stay there. He had to work
every day.
   ``I tried lyrics for all 15. On some the words and melodies
weren't quite right. It was nice that we had enough. There was one
about marijuana _ it's a great song. Too bad. It was lagging behind
in the race for the record so it didn't make it.''
   Byrne, who is British, married the American Lutz last July in
Paris. Harrison has a son who is 1 years old, and Weymouth and
Frantz, who are married, have two sons, who are 5 and 2.
   Since they all have individual commitments to pursue the next
Talking Heads project probably will be another album instead of a
tour.
   ``I put together `Storytelling Giant,' a compilation of all the
band videos, and shot some extra material to go between them, to
kind of link them.
   ``I hope to direct another movie, with Robert Wilson, in the
summer in Europe. That's still in the planning stage. We did
something a couple of years ago, `The Knee Plays.' I think that's
going into a theater in Chicago.''
   Byrne's last film was ``True Stories,'' a musical romp about an
``average'' Texas town.
   Byrne also composed music for some scenes in Bernardo
Bertolucci's ``The Last Emperor,'' which won nine Acaemy Awards.
   Harrison, who produced the BoDeans' ``Inside Looking Out,'' is
putting together a band to tour behind the album he just released
on Sire Records, `Casual Gods.'
   ``I did `Casual Gods' in Wisconsin in a basement studio,'' he
said. ``My mother was ill and my father had passed away. I went
back to Milwaukee to take care of her whenever I could be there. I
found a basement studio I could rent by the week rather than by the
hour, owned by the younger brother of someone I had grown up with.
   ``Musicians would pass through town or I used local musicians. I
was paying for it myself. When I was offered a production job I
would always do it. That caused my record to extend over the years.
I think it made it much better. The songs are more diverse and I
think my singing got better.''
   Weymouth said she and Frantz just finished ``Conscious Party''
by Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers. It is their only production
outside of the Tom Tom Club.
   ``We are going into the studio to finish up our third Tom Tom
Club record,'' Frantz said. ``After it's released in June, I think
we'll tour in Europe. We're in demand in Europe.
   ``Ziggy Marley, who's 19, writes all the material. His brother
Steve, 15, sings one song. Cedella is 20. Rita and Sharon, who's a
mother of two, sing backgrounds.'' The Melody Makers, formed by the
late reggae king Bob Marley, have been around since Ziggy was 8.
   ``It's hard for me to imagine doing all this when I was 19,''
remarked Byrne.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Cambodian Nightmare Lives On for Author</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES REINDL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The physical torture is over for Haing S. Ngor,
former doctor, Cambodian refugee, movie actor and now author and
activist.
   But the nightmares won't stop, and he can't forgive himself for
being the only member of his immediate family to survive four
hellish years under the Khmer Rouge, the Cambodian communists who
seized power in 1975.
   ``Yes, I have survivor's guilt,'' he says, sitting in a luxury
suite at a plush Chicago hotel.
   ``And every night I still have nightmares and I will never be
forgiven by my memory for watching my wife die, watching my parents
tortured by the Khmer Rouge, beaten by the Khmer Rouge, killed by
the Khmer Rouge.''
   Ngor, 40, won an Academy Award in 1985 for his first acting role
when he portrayed Cambodian journalist Dith Pran in ``The Killing
Fields.'' His own tale of survival under the brutal Khmer Rouge
regime is told in ``Haing Ngor: A Cambodian Odyssey'' (MacMillan
Publishing Co., $19.95), which Ngor wrote with journalist Roger
Warner.
   The book is an understated account of life in a country savaged
first by civil war, then by Khmer Rouge occupation. Ngor writes of
scrounging for edible insects to stay alive. He writes of watching
his wife die in childbirth because helping her would reveal he was
a doctor and mean his own certain death. And he writes of torture _
his own and others'.
   No embellishment could add to the horror that comes through in
this straight accounting.
   ``They tied my upper arms to the cross and then my thighs and my
feet,'' Ngor writes about one of the three times he was imprisoned
and tortured. ``Then they threw the rope attached to the top of the
cross over the goalpost and hoisted me up until my feet were above
the pile of wood and rice hulls. I swayed there, back and forth.
   ``After the guards tied all of the prisoners they went around to
each pile of rice hulls and lit it with cigarette lighters.
   ``Rice hulls have a consistency like sawdust. Fires with rice
hulls give off thick, stinging smoke and burn slowly, for days.''
   The war in Vietnam spilled over into Cambodia, but the country's
own civil war racked what had been for centuries a sleepy, agrarian
culture where government corruption was accepted.
   For many Cambodians of mixed ancestry, the native, dark-skinned
Khmers of the countryside seemed to pose no danger. But in 1975,
the Khmer Rouge won control of Cambodia, renaming it Democratic
Kampuchea. Americans were airlifted out of the country and many
well-off Cambodians _ such as Ngor, with his medical degree,
Mercedes-Benz and merchant family background _ left too.
   But he stayed.
   ``I couldn't believe that the Khmer Rouge would do what they
did,'' Ngor said. ``I couldn't believe that the Khmer Rouge would
be so brutal, so cruel. And not only me, the other educated people
thought the same way.''
   As part of their purge, the Khmer Rouge relocated the
population, emptying the cities and forcing residents into the
countryside. There are estimates 2 million to 3 million Cambodians
died under the Khmer Rouge.
   On the day the capital, Phnom Penh, fell to the Khmer Rouge,
Ngor was operating on a wounded government soldier. He left the
patient to die, beginning his own struggle for survival.
   Ngor's four years of hell didn't end until Vietnam invaded
Cambodia and Ngor had made his way to Thailand and then to the
United States and his new home in Los Angeles.
   ``A Cambodian Odyssey'' began taking shape in a Thai refugee
camp, Ngor says. It took two years to write.
   The book is a memorial to ``my wife, my family ... and ... the
people that were killed by the Khmer Rouge,'' Ngor says. But both
the book and the movie were a catharsis as well.
   Ngor says he's seen ``The Killing Fields'' only once. ``I didn't
want to watch, because it seemed like it would bring back all my
memories,'' he says.
   ``Why I decided to do it, because before I crossed the border, I
go to my wife's grave and say, `Sweet, one day I will tell our
story to the world.'
   ``Secondly, I know that film is very touching, but I have to
tell the world and I have not only the movie, but ... I ... write
that book.''
   Ngor still lives in California and he says he's devoting some of
his book and movie earnings to building hospitals for refugees
along the Thailand's border with Cambodia, which remains under
Vietnamese occupation.
   A Buddhist, Ngor filters his experience through his belief in
karma, the cycle of birth, suffering and rebirth.
   ``Maybe in my last life before this one, I did something wrong
to hurt people,'' he says. ``But this life, I paid back ... Please,
next life do not separate my family and my wife.
   ``I want to have my whole family. And, I don't want to see that
kind of torture.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Career Of Johnny Cash Cited</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Johnny Cash, the ebony-clad singer whose
mournful and mirthful songs have been entertaining country music
fans for 32 years, is being celebrated in a special exhibit at the
Country Music Hall of Fame.
   The $70,000 exhibit includes photographs, costumes, posters,
films of his early TV appearances, one of his first guitars and
such personal mementos as a Frederick Remington bronze.
   A million people are expected to see the exhibit during the next
two years on Nashville's Music Row _ a section of the city that
pioneers such as Cash helped to make.
   ``There's a lot of memories here,'' said the 56-year-old Cash,
known as ``the man in black'' because of the color he wears to
remind people of the downtrodden.
   ``It's a terrific display,'' he said. ``I'm very proud of it.''
   Cash rose from the black dirt of an Arkansas farm to peaks that
few in country music can match.
   He has recorded nearly 1,500 songs, many of them focusing on the
toil of achieving the American dream. His themes have made him a
forerunner of such performers as Bruce Springsteen, John Cougar
Mellencamp and Bob Seger.
   His albums ``Folsom Prison,'' ``San Quentin'' and ``Greatest
Hits'' have sold more than 2 million copies each. He has won seven
Grammy awards, including two he shared with wife June Carter, who's
at his side as often as his guitar.
   He has received 23 songwriting awards as the composer of hits
such as ``Folsom Prison Blues,'' ``I Walk the Line,'' ``Big
River,'' ``I Got Stripes,'' ``A Boy Named Sue'' and others. His
compositions also include ``Tennessee Flat Top Box,'' which was
recently a No. 1 country hit by daughter Rosanne.
   However, he may be in the twilight of his recording career. His
recent records have not been hits on the country charts.
   ``I don't know if this will be my last album or not,'' he said
about his forthcoming LP, which includes duets with several major
stars. ``But it's time I got all my old friends into the studio to
sing with me. Just in case.''
   Over the years, Cash has entertained U.S. presidents, had a
network TV show, starred in more than a dozen movies and sold more
than 50 million records.
   He also has developed a reputation for having some of the best
informal music gatherings ever held. Those who have grabbed guitars
and performed at his palatial lakeside home include Bob Dylan, Paul
McCartney, Kris Kristofferson, Roger Miller, Larry Gatlin, Waylon
Jennings, Graham Nash and Joan Baez. He's also fished with Mick
Jagger.
   Cash and Jennings are longtime close friends.
   ``He's been like a brother to me,'' Jennings said. ``He's one of
the greatest people in the world.''
   Among Cash's humanitarian ventures over the years have been
dozens of benefit concerts at prisons. These concerts, and the
songs he sings about prison, have fueled a popular misconception
that he is an ex-convict. He did have an addiction problem in the
1960s which he overcame late in that decade.
   His writing has not been restricted to songs. His 1975
autobiography, ``Man in Black,'' sold 1.3 million copies. His more
recent ``Man in White'' is about the conversion of the Apostle Paul.
   He said in 1980 when elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame,
``Many can sing country music, but not many ARE country music. It's
the stylists that have made country music what it is today (and)
given country music a shot in the arm. So do it your way. Don't let
yourself get caught in a bag.''
   The Country Music Hall of Fame exhibit, following similar ones
about Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson, drew from items Cash and his
wife had collected.
   ``Some of my favorite artifacts and bronzes are here,'' Cash
said. ``I wanted to make it a little more personal than average
museums. So I took pen and paper and wrote down my thoughts.''
   There are 130 photographs, 80 artifacts and 40 screen
productions and video clips.
   Someone asked Cash how he collected so many items.
   ``One at a time,'' he said.

unexpectedly after a month-long battle with colon cancer. He was 62.
   Olson's death on Monday came after just 1{ years as leader of

   The operating rate of American industry fell
for a second month in March despite a rebound at auto plants, the
government says.
   The Federal Reserve said Monday that U.S. factories, mines and
utilities operated at 82.3 percent of capacity last month, down
from an operating rate of 82.4 percent in February.
   U.S. factories had operated at 82.6 percent of capacity in
January, the highest level in more than eight years. In spite of
the declines, analysts said the economy still shows plenty of
strength.

   Bond and commodity prices have risen on inflation fears sparked
by a resurgence of violence in the Persian Gulf, although the stock
market finished only slightly lower.
   Separately on Monday, the government reported that factory
operating rates declined during March, the second straight monthly
decline in the statistic despite a rebound at auto plants.
   In reaction to reports that U.S. forces destroyed two Iranian
oil platforms in retaliation for an Iranian mine attack on a U.S.
frigate, the yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue
jumped to 9.01 percent _ its highest level in three months _ from
8.94 percent late Friday.
   The rise in interest rates helped depress the stock market,
where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.81 points to close at
2,008.12. Investors were concerned that stocks could suffer
declines if bond yields continue to rise.
   Gold and oil prices rose. Analysts said oil production from
other sources sharply would diminish the impact of any cutoff of
oil from the Persian Gulf states, but they said the market reacted
with typical skittishness at the prospect.
   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, closed at
$18.52 per barrel, up 15 cents from Friday's closing price on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Contracts for refined products also
rose.
   In the currency markets, the prospect of an oil shortage pushed
the British pound to a six-year high against the dollar. Traders
said tensions in the Persian Gulf put the spotlight on Britain's
North Sea oil fields. The pound rose to $1.9050 from $1.9004 on
Friday.
   Separately, the Federal Reserve said U.S. factories, mines and
utilities operated at 82.3 percent of capacity last month, down
from an operating rate of 82.4 percent in February.
   U.S. factories had operated at 82.6 percent of capacity in
January, the highest level in more than eight years.
   Analysts said the small declines in the operating level over the
past two months were not worrisome and represented cutbacks in
industries trying to work down high inventories of unsold goods.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in the government's latest auction to their lowest
levels in three weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 5.78 percent on Monday, down from
5.98 percent last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month
bills at an average discount rate of 6.14 percent, down from 6.19
percent last week.
   The rates were the lowest since March 28, when three-month bills
sold for 5.69 percent and six-month bills averaged 6 percent,
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 5.95 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,853.90, and 6.42 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,689.60.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, fell to 6.92
percent last week after averaging 7.01 percent the week before.

<HEAD>Irving Accepts `White Knight' Cash Tender Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``white knight'' that Irving Bank Corp.
sought for help in its bitter battle against hostile suitor Bank of
New York Co. turned out to be Italy's second-largest bank.
   Irving said Monday that state-run Banca Commerciale Italiana has
agreed to acquire a 51 percent stake in Irving for $65 a share in
cash, or $617.5 million, countering Bank of New York's overtures.
   Irving also announced a complex restructuring plan that includes
the sale of its 50-story Wall Street headquarters, a cost-cutting
program and a boost in its annual stock dividends.
   The company put the total value of the cash offer and
restructuring at between $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion.
   Irving spokesman D. Emerson Phelps said the deal would allow
Irving management to retain control of the company, although the
board of directors would be expanded to include four Banca
Commerciale representatives.
   In addition to the Banca Commerciale tender offer, which begins
today, Irving shareholders will get a special dividend of $10 a
share upon completion of the deal, Irving said.
   The company said stockholders could receive cash for about half
of their shares, and retain the other half.
   ``Our shareholders will benefit far more from the affiliation
with BCI than the proposal advanced from BNY (Bank of New York),''
Irving Chairman Joseph A. Rice stated. ``Irving anticipates
increases in its revenues as a result of its ongoing relationship
with BCI.''
   Irving's announcement comes just days after Bank of New York
shareholders voted to support management's $1 billion-plus hostile
offer for Irving. Bank of New York last month began a tender offer
of $15 in cash and 1.575 of its common shares for each of Irving's
roughly 18.1 common shares outstanding.
   Bank of New York, which holds a 4.9 percent stake in Irving,
also is running a slate of 16 nominees to Irving's board of
directors. Irving's annual meeting is scheduled for Thursday,
although most business will be conducted at a reconvened meeting on
Saturday to give shareholders time to digest the BCI offer, Irving
said.
   Irving over the past seven months repeatedly has spurned Bank of
New York's takeover proposals, maintaining it wanted to remain
independent but recently disclosing it was seeking a ``white
knight'' friendly merger partner as an alternative.
   Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady said his company would to
study the Banca Commerciale offer, but it felt its own bid was
superior.
   Brady also said the foreign offer for Irving could run into
problems gaining regulatory approval from the state of New York and
the Federal Reserve, contending Banca Commerciale might have
problems meeting capital adequacy requirements.
   Michael Starr, a banking analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. in
Chicago, said Bank of New York could sweeten its current offer, but
it would have to resubmit to the lengthy regulatory process that
includes hearings before the Federal Reserve and New York State
Banking boards.
   Analysts said they weren't surprised Irving sought help from a
foreign bank, because many large U.S. banks lack the capital for
big acquisitions. But some experts said they found the complexity
of the deal may have accounted for the relatively lackluster
activity in Irving stock.
   Irving shares rose slightly on the New York Stock Exchange on
Monday before declining to close $1 lower at $60.37{. Bank of New
York shares gained $1 to $31.65{.
   As part of its restructuring Irving said it would enact a hiring
freeze as part of an intensive cost saving program. The program
could raise net income to about $1.60 a share in 1988 and $2.75
next year.
   In addition, the company said said it immediately would increase
its annual common dividend from $2.42 a share to $4.50.
   To pay for the special $10-a-share dividend, Irving said it
planned to sell its Wall Street headquarters and its 39 percent
equity interest in Banca della Svizzera Italiana for more than the
current market price of about $325 million.
   Banca Commerciale, based in Milan, has assets of about $60
billion and is Italy's second largest bank, behind Banca Nazionale
del Lavoro. About 64 percent of Banca Commerciale is owned by the
giant state holding company Istituto per la Ricostruzione
Industriale. Irving's assets total $24.12 billion.
   Irving lost $193.27 million last year, after raising its
loan-loss reserves to cover troubled Third World debt.

   Here's a chronological look at Bank of New York Co.'s hostile
takeover attempt of Irving Bank Corp.:
   _Sept. 25, 1987. Bank of New York makes an unsolicited $1.4
billion cash-stock bid for Irving Bank.
   _Oct. 9. Irving's board of directors rejects the $1.4 billion
bid, activates the company's sharholders' rights, ``poison pill''
defense.
   _Oct. 21. The Federal Reserve asks the Bank of New York to
provide further details on its takeover offer, saying the
application was ``seriously deficit'' in key information.
   _Nov. 9. Irving Chairman Joseph A. Rice asks Bank of New York to
withdraw its $1.4 billion bid, which it called ``disruptive,
illusionary and unreal.''
   _Nov. 20. Bank of New York lowers its offer to $1.2 billion,
citing depressed share prices and changing economic conditions
following the Oct. 19 stock market crash.
   _Dec. 15. Irving's board rejects Bank of New York's revised
offer.
   _Jan. 25, 1988. Bank of New York lowers its bid to $1.08
billion, saying it reflects several factors, including Irving's
decision to add another $225 million to its fourth-quarter
loan-loss reserve to cover shaky Third World debt.
   _Feb. 1. Irving sues the New York State Banking Board, alleging
it withheld ``substantial information'' about the Bank of New York
merger application and misled Irving on how soon the board might

York State Banking Department to give 10-day written notice before
acting on Bank of New York's application.

from the Fed and New York State Banking Board, with both groups
contending a merger wouldn't hurt competition.

Court in Washington, D.C., saying it would ask the court to review
the Federal Reserve's decision approving the merger.
   _March 15. Irving amends its ``poison pill,'' under which
shareholders' rights would go into effect only with the present
board in existence or unless the new board was elected by at least
two-thirds of the outstanding common shares.
   _March 18. Bank of New York receives SEC permission of its
registration statement, giving it the go-ahead to proceed with its
tender offer.
   _March 25. Irving says in a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing that it is seeking a ``white knight'' friendly bidder and
other alternatives to Bank of New York's offer.
   _March 28. Irving announces its board approved another amendment
to its poison pill, activating shareholders' rights after 5 percent
of the company's outstanding shares are acquired. Bank of New York
begins solicits proxy votes in an effort to gain control of
Irving's board.
   _March 31. Bank of New York amends its complaint of Irving's
poison pill.
   _April 4. Irving releases a letter to shareholders predicting a

solicitation.
   _April 7. Irving files an amendment to an SEC filing to include

   Robert E. Allen will have a chance on Wednesday
to convince AT&T's shareholders that the company remains on track
in spite of the death from cancer of Chairman James E. Olson.
   Olson's death on Monday at age 62 came just two days before the
company's annual shareholders' meeting in Denver. It shocked the
company, coming just one month after the vigorous, tough-talking
executive was reported ill with flu.
   Allen, 53, who will field questions at the annual meeting, is
the president and chief operating officer of American Telephone &
Telegraph Co.and is serving as acting chairman.
   Analysts say Allen was being groomed to succeed Olson as
chairman, although no one expected the transition to come so
quickly. He is the odds-on favorite to be named chairman by the
board of directors, which might make a decision this week.
   Like Olson, Allen rose in AT&T through the local telephone
operating companies that once belonged to the Bell System. He also
is a career AT&T executive. But in contrast to the blunt,
gregarious Olson, Allen is described as quiet and thoughtful,
though determined.
   ``He's a very bright and very direct kind of guy and very
low-key. If you lived in a nice neighborhood, he'd be one of the
nicer neighbors,'' said Peter Bernstein, senior analyst at Probe
Research Inc. in Cedar Knolls, N.J.
   Olson became AT&T chairman in September 1986, when the company
still was adrift after the 1984 breakup of the Bell System. He cut
costs, oversaw the painful cutting of 27,000 jobs and gave the
company a sense of direction.
   ``Olson was the one guy who was hard-nosed enough that he would
push and get his way, and drive people who may not feel the same
pressure under the new chairman,'' said Fulton Holmes, an analyst
for Thomson McKinnon Securities.
   In contrast to Olson, whose first job with AT&T was cleaning
silt out of manholes in North Dakota in 1943, Allen started out in
management at Indiana Bell after his graduation from Wabash College.
   Allen worked his way up through Indiana Bell, Bell of
Pennsylvania, Illinois Bell and the Chesapeake and Potomac
Telephone Cos. He was slated to become a president in
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic at the time of the AT&T breakup in
1984, but instead was called to serve as executive vice president
and chief financial officer of AT&T in July 1983.
   Allen took charge of corporate administration and finance in
1984 and was promoted to chairman and chief executive of AT&T
Information Systems in 1985. He was named president and chief
operating officer in 1986.
   In a sign of Allen's standing, he shared the spotlight with
Olson in the introduction to the company's latest annual report,
which featured a question-and-answer session with the two
executives.
   Here are some of the problems AT&T will have to face with Olson
gone:
   _Morale, though somewhat improved, still leaves room for
improvement, AT&T's own surveys have found.
   _The company's computer business continues losing money and may
not become profitable until 1990. Some analysts say the company
needs to buy an established computer maker.
   _Shareholders are agitating for an increase in the quarterly
dividend, which has been $1.20 a share since the breakup.
   _AT&T still gets 91 percent of its revenue in the United States
and is having a hard time cracking foreign markets, a company goal
since the early 1980s.
   Analysts differed on how significant Olson's loss would be.
   ``In a lot of ways, Allen is an unknown quantity. My sense is he
does not have the kind of following Olson had. But he has not been
in a position where he could get those loyalties,'' said Daniel
Rosenbaum, executive editor of Wiretap newsletter in Morristown,
N.J.
   ``What he (Olson) forged together may start to slip apart a
little bit,'' said Thomson McKinnon's Holmes.
   But Jack Grubman, an analyst for PaineWebber Inc., said Allen is
Olson's hand-picked successor. And he said, ``Jim (Olson) is not
the type of guy to groom someone if he did not feel that person
would carry forward his plans.''
   On the New York Stock Exchange, AT&T stock fell 25 cents to
26.37{ on Monday.
   Allen and his wife, Elizabeth, have five children and live in
Short Hills, N.J., Olson's hometown.

<HEAD>Armstrong Sale To Lead Armtek In Search Of More Automotive-related
Businesses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armtek Corp. says it will be looking to
acquire additional automotive-related businesses once it completes
the sale of its Armstrong Tire Co. to Italy's Pirelli Group.
   Armtek announced Monday it had agreed to sell Armstrong Tire to
Pirelli, one of Europe's largest tiremakers, for $190 million cash.
   Armtek will use most if not all of the proceeds to reduce its
long-term debt, which stood at about $300 million the end of the
first quarter, said John N. Sievers, director of corporate planning
and investor relations.
   Armtek also will seek additional acquisitions to pursue its goal
of becoming a leading worldwide supplier of materials, components
and systems to automotive and industrial markets, company officials
said.
   ``We will not stray at all from our automotive focus,'' Sievers
said.
   Armtek is the parent of Dayco Products Inc., a supplier of
engineered drive systems, including automotive and industrial belts
and hoses; Blackstone Corp., a maker of heat exchange systems and
components, and Copolymer Rubber & Chemical Corp., a producer of
specialty polymers.
   Sievers said growth prospects were good for all three companies.
   Armstrong Tire, founded 75 years ago, employs about 2,700
people. The company supplies the majority of all passenger and
light-truck radial tires sold by Sears Roebuck and Co., its largest
customer for more than 50 years. It is also a leading supplier of
farm tires.
   Pirelli had sought last year to acquire 80 percent of Armstrong
Tire, but talks ended because the companies could not agree on the
value of the proposed buyout, Armtek officials said.
   This time, Armtek and Pirelli signed an agreement for the sale
of 100 percent of Armstrong Tire.
   Ludovico Grandi, president of Pirelli's worldwide tire
operation, said Pirelli would benefit from Armstrong's ``excellent
aftermarket distribution and efficient production facilities.''
   The transaction is subject to approval by Armtek's board, which
meets today and Wednesday, and is expected to close by May 31.
   Pirelli Societe Generale SA of Milan, Italy, recently lost out
to Japan's Bridgestone Corp. in a bidding war for Firestone Tire &
Rubber Co.
   Pirelli will be acquiring three Armstrong tire manufacturing
plants in Des Moines, Iowa; Hanford, Calif., and Nashville, Tenn.,
and its tire chord and fabric manufacturing facility in Laurel
Hill, N.C.
   Armstrong is not selling its tube plant in Little Rock, Ark.,
although Pirelli has expressed interest in acquiring it later,
Sievers said.
   Pirelli has agreed, as part of the sale, to purchase raw
materials from Copolymer Rubber & Chemical on a long-term basis,
Sievers said.
   The sale of Armstrong to Pirelli follows a general trend of
consolidation in the tire industry brought on by the widespread use
of radial tires, which do not need to be replaced frequently.
   Buffeted by both domestic and foreign competition, Armtek had
been reducing its reliance on the tire business in recent years.
   In 1980, 90 percent of the revenue of Armstrong Rubber Co., now
known as Armtek, came from the tire business. By the end of the
1987 fiscal year, that segment accounted for only 38 percent of its
$1.2 billion in revenue.
   About 300 people are employed as corporate staff for Armstrong
at Armtek's headquarters here. Sievers said the sale was not
expected to change the management structure significantly.

<HEAD>Report: Enhanced Oil Recovery Projects Down 28 Percent in Two
Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of enhanced oil recovery projects
operating in the United States fell by 28 percent over the past two
years due to the sliding price of crude oil, according to an
industry magazine.
   The projects, which are aimed at boosting oil recovery from
known reservoirs, suffered from crude prices that were too low to
provide incentives for expansion and from a lack of capital to
invest in new projects, the Oil and Gas Journal reported in its
Monday issue.
   The Journal's report came as about 1,000 industry
representatives attended a three-day symposium on enhanced oil
recovery methods beginning here on Monday.
   Oil prices, which remain in the $18-a-barrel range, are forcing
larger American producers away from high-cost enhanced oil recovery
methods and into areas with quicker payoffs, said Lowell R. Smith,
chairman of the Tulsa symposium and head of research for Amoco
Production Company's Tulsa facility.
   A Journal survey indicated 366 active EOR projects in the United
States, compared with 512 projects at the same time two years ago.
Over the same period, production from enhanced recovery operations
increased slightly to 637,000 barrels of oil a day.
   Enhanced oil recovery techniques include the the injection of
steam, gases or liquids into oil-producing formations. Thermal
recovery methods, mostly steam injection, account for about 73
percent of the additional production resulting from EOR operations,
the Journal said.
   Some $960 million will be spent on enhanced recovery projects
planned for 1988 and 1989 in the United States and elsewhere, based
on investment information for 76 projects during that period, the
magazine stated.

<HEAD>Bank of Ireland In Agreement To Acquire New Hampshire Banking
Concern</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Bank Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First NH Banks Inc., the state's largest
bank holding company, has signed a definitive agreement to be
acquired by Bank of Ireland for about $370 million.
   The $30.50 a share buyout proposal announced Monday, which is
subject to approval by shareholders of both companies and banking
regulators, comes as New Hampshire is about to relax its
restrictions on interstate banking.
   First NH stock rose $1.50 to $27 a share Monday in national
over-the-counter trading.
   Raymond Schwedhelm, a spokesman for First NH Banks, said the
bank would retain its name and current management under the Bank of
Ireland proposal.
   Bank of Ireland has assets of about $15 billion while NH Banks
has $2.5 billion in assets.
   Banking analysts said they considered First NH Banks a prime
takeover target following a revised banking bill expected to be
signed into law this month by Gov. John Sununu.
   Enactment of the banking bill is expected to spark an avalanche
of negotiations for New Hampshire banks, which no out-of-state bank
seriously pursued under the interstate banking law passed last year.
   ``The New Hampshire economy is strong; they have good tax laws
and a low unemployment rate ... It's a state that most bankers are
envious about and want to get into,'' said James Moynihan, a bank
analyst at Advest Inc. in Boston.
   Under existing law, regional banks merging with or acquiring a
New Hampshire bank must have all their deposits within New England.
They are prohibited from acquiring banks outside New England once
they buy New Hampshire institutions.
   The pending revision means an acquiring bank need have only 51
percent of its deposits in New England on the day it applies for
state approval of a purchase. The revised measure also loosens
restrictions on doing business with banks outside of the region.

   Federal Aviation Administrator Allen McArtor
said today he is ``delighted that there is a consensus that change
is needed'' in the nation's air safety system.
   ``It's not a matter of unsafe or safe, or that something is
wrong; its just that improvement is necessary, improvement is
required,'' McArtor said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   His comments came a day after a presidential commission said
that the government should step up its inspection of the nation's
airlines if safety is to be maintained, and should establish a
``permanent program of in-depth'' examinations of air carriers.
   The findings were released as the Federal Aviation
Administration continued its detailed inspection of two of the
country's largest airlines, Continental and Eastern, and a staged a
broad review of safety among the country's commuter airlines.
   The presidential panel called on the FAA to hire additional
inspectors, stage more frequent surprise inspections and give
priority to airlines undergoing major changes.
   ``These changes to the inspection program are critical to
maintaining safety,'' said John Albertine, chairman of the
President's Commission on Aviation Safety.
   Albertine, also appearing on ``Today,'' commented that the FAA
is falling behind in the area of technology because of federal
regulations relating to procurement.
   In addition, the agency is hampered by civil service hiring
rules, Albertine said. He said he would hope a new, independent
agency, could set its own, more flexible, hiring and procurement
practices.
   Rep. Guy Molinari, R-N.Y., during an appearance on ABC's Good
Morning America, termed the idea of surprise inspections a good one
   The current safety system is basically sound, Moninari said,
there just aren't enough air traffic controllers, maintenance
technicians and safety inspectors. More of those people are needed,
he said.
   Last year the FAA had just over 2,000 inspectors, an increase of
about 500 over the last five years, the commission said.
   The panel released its report after a nine-month study of
airline safety and recommended:
   _The FAA be separated from the Transportation Department under
an independent authority funded through aviation taxes.
   _Creation of a top-ranking official in the new FAA who would
assume the job of ``aviation safety czar'' and have broad
regulatory powers.
   _Safety requirements for commuter airlines be gradually
tightened to put them on the same level as the major air carriers.
   _Requiring small, private planes flying near ``hub'' airports to
have equipment that tells controllers altitude information. The FAA
already has proposed regulations that would require such equipment
on an even broader scale.
   The commission concluded that while commercial aviation remains
safe, the government may lose its ability to keep the skies safe
without ``major structural overhaul'' of the way the airline
industry is regulated.
   ``The nation's air transportation system is safe, for now,''
said Albertine. ``However, that safety is being maintained to an
increasing extent through delays and through what I can only
characterize as heroic efforts of air traffic controllers, airways
facilities technicians, safety inspectors and other FAA personnel.''
   The commission rejected suggestions by some industry groups that
the FAA be taken out of the government and be made a semi-private
agency. It also said it was not in favor of spinning off air
traffic control functions into a private function as has been
suggested by Transportation Secretary James Burnley.
   ``The regulatory process must remain governmental in character
and not be taken out of the federal government or removed from
public accountability,'' said Albertine.
   Initial reaction to the report was favorable, although both
industry and congressional sources expressed skepticism that
Congress would go along with creation of an ``aviation safety
czar.''
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., chairman of the Senate Commerce,
Science and Transportation subcommittee on aviation, said the
commission's proposal to remove the agency from the Transportation
Department is a ``much-needed change.''
   Ford is sponsoring a bill that would make the FAA an independent
agency, a proposal endorsed Monday by several industry
organizations.
   Gabriel Phillips, executive vice president of the Air Transport
Asociation, which represents the nation's airlines, said
reorganization of the FAA ``is the only way to solve'' personnel,
purchasing and other problems.
   John O'Brien, a safety official of the Air Line Pilots
Association and John Thornton, national coordinator for the
National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said the commission's
findings are likely to give a boost to legislation calling for an
independent FAA within the government.
   Burnley, the Transportation secretary, has not endorsed an
independent FAA although he favors turning air traffic control
functions over to a private entity.
   Recently Jim Burnett, chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, expressed concern about the influence the airlines
might have over an independent FAA.
   ``I'm concerned that the aviation industry is trying to get an
independent FAA because it is easier for them to dominate an
independent FAA,'' said Burnett.
   The seven members of the commission created by Congress were
appointed last year by President Reagan. They concluded that the
1978 deregulation of the airline industry has not eroded safety, as
some critics have contended.
   While the number of airline passengers has grown from about 250
million in 1978 to 450 million last year, the numbers of accidents,
fatalities and injuries have all decreased, the report said.

   Stocks opened higher this morning, bolstered by
a mild rebound in the bond market and improved quarterly earnings
of some leading blue-chip companies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 10.28 points
to 2,018.40.
   Gaining stocks outnumbered declines by more than 2-to-1 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 662 up, 303 down and 465 unchanged.
Volume totaled 23.14 million shares after the first half hour.
   Stocks of some key components in the Dow average were largely
responsible for the early gains. Merck rose 2 to 159}, Alcoa rose
1] to 44~ and Philip Morris rose ~ to 87~. Those companies reported
higher first-quarter earnings.
   Wall Street also benefited from a partial recovery in the
slumping bond market early today, which pushed the yield on the
30-year Treasury bill back under 9 percent. That made bonds less
attractive as an alternative investment to stocks.
   The NYSE's composite index of all listed issues rose 0.50 to
147.27. The American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 0.54
to 301.46.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.81 points to
2,008.12.
   Gaining and losing issues were about even in NYSE composite
trading, with 771 up, 765 down and 460 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 144.65 million shares, against 234.16 million shares traded
in the previous session.

<HEAD>Shearson Defends Koppers Takeover Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. continues
defending its controversial role in the hostile $1.7 billion
takeover bid being waged for Koppers Co., while Koppers says its
first quarter net loss stemmed partly from expenses in defending
against the bid.
   The group led by Shearson and Britain's Beazer PLC on Monday
extended its stalled $60 a share tender offer through midnight EDT
Friday.
   The one-week extension had been expected following a federal
judge's ruling last Friday that indefinitely blocked the bid
because of apparent securities law violations.
   Koppers stock fell 37{ cents to $53.25 a share in New York Stock
Exchange trading on Monday.
   U.S. District Judge Maurice B. Cohill Jr., who issued the
injunction blocking the tender offer, has said the takeover was the
first known instance of an investment bank being the outright owner
of a takeover vehicle.
   He also has called Shearson a ``major equity participant'' in
the deal and said that although the firm had only limited voting
rights in the company created to acquire Koppers it was one of the
entities on whose behalf the hostile bid was made.
   Peter A. Cohen, chairman of Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., parent of the investment bank, told reporters on Monday that
the firm's role in the takeover attempt was not unusual or out of
line.
   BNS Inc., the company formed by Shearson, British industrialist
Brian C. Beazer and National Westminster Bank to acquire Koppers.
   Shearson paid $23 million for a 46 percent interest in BNS,
which compares with the 49 percent interest worth $24.5 million
held by Beazer, chairman of the British construction and building
materials company bearing his name.
   Cohen and other Shearson executives said the firm doesn't hold
real equity because it can force Beazer to buy its share within
five years and Beazer can force Shearson to sell through a ``call.''
   Cohen said equity ``is something that's got a continuous life,
and ours doesn't.''
   For several years takeover lenders have been accepting warrants,
or the right to purchase stock at a specified price, ``and
warrants...the last time I looked (were) characterized as an equity
security,'' Cohen said.
   Shearson probably will make less than $30 million on its equity
in BNS, he said, declining to say what Shearson stands to make in
fees.
   Separately, Koppers said it spent at least $3.5 million in the
first quarter to resist the hostile bid, helping generate a
quarterly net loss of $8.5 million. The company posted a $3 million
net loss in first quarter 1987.
   At least half of the additional $7 million Koppers incurred in
first-quarter overhead was in fees for attorneys, financial
advisers and other defense costs, said company spokesman Robert J.
O'Gara.
   O'Gara said he could not quantify the defense expenses beyond
saying they were a majority of the $7 million. The tender offer was
launched March 3, two-thirds of the way through the quarter.
   Koppers said its first-quarter sales climbed 13 percent from
$271.7 million to $306.7 million.
   The company's construction materials and services businesses had
operating losses totaling $2.3 million, compared to losses of $4.1
million a year earlier. Operating earnings in chemicals and related
products climbed to $8.6 million from $6.4 million.

   Campeau Corp. says it expects to have
financing in place by week's end for its $6.6 billion purchase of
Federated Department Stores Inc.
   Campeau also announced Monday it has extended its tender offer
for all of Federated's shares until 5 p.m. April 28. Without the
renewal, Campeau's offer to pay $73.50 per share for all of
Federated's stock would have expired on Wednesday.
   Campeau, a Canadian development and retailing company based in
Toronto, has said its cost of purchasing Federated will actually be
$8.8 billion. That figure includes Campeau's financing costs and
the expense of the takeover battle it has waged since Jan. 25 for
Federated.
   Federated owns and operates more than 650 department, mass
merchandise and supermarket stores nationwide.
   Campeau, which purchased Allied Stores Corp. in 1986, has said
it plans to move some of Allied's executives from New York City to
Federated's current headquarters operation.

<HEAD>Company Announces First IBM Personal System-2 Clone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dell Computer Corp. has become the first
company to announce it has developed personal computers based on
International Business Machines Corp.'s patented Personal System-2
design.
   The Dell System 400 and System 500 are expected to be available
for sale in the final three months of 1988 and should cost about 30
percent less than comparable IBM models, Michael Dell, the
company's 23-year-old founder and chief executive, announced Monday.
   Dell said it expects to complete a patent licensing agreement
with IBM ``in the very near future.''
   IBM spokesman John Mihalec said the company could not confirm
talks with particular companies, but reaffirmed that the company is
willing to provide licenses on its patents under reasonable terms
and conditions.
   However, Mihalec said a patent license does not protect a
company if it happens to infringe on features of the Personal
System-2 and its Micro Channel Architecture that are protected in
other ways, such as by copyrights.
   IBM's Micro Channel Architecture has been touted by IBM as a way
to improve the performance of personal computers when they are
linked together in networks. It also allows the machine to perform
more than one major task at a time.
   But industry analysts say the new Personal System-2 computers
still lack the software and additional features to take full
advantage of the new design. They say machines with conventional
designs offer higher performance for less cost.
   Dell reported sales of $159 million and earnings of $9.4 million
for its last fiscal year ended Jan. 31. It has grown to the
country's seventh largest maker of personal computers since being
founded in 1984 with a $1,000 investment.

   Stocks strengthened this morning, bolstered by a
mild rebound in the bond market and improved quarterly earnings of
some leading blue-chip companies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 18.57 points
to 2,026.69 as of 11 a.m. EDT.
   Gaining stocks outnumbered declines by more than 2-to-1 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 875 up, 363 down and 474 unchanged.
But volume totaled a relatively slow 53.63 million shares after the
first 90 minutes, suggesting that many large-scale investors
remained reluctant to participate.
   ``I don't see any institutional buying,'' said Robert O'Toole,
manager of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
in New York. ``This is just a trader's market.''
   Stocks of some key components in the Dow average were largely
responsible for the early gains. Merck rose 2} to 160{, Alcoa rose
2 to 45{ and Philip Morris rose 1 to 88. Those companies reported
higher first-quarter earnings.
   Wall Street also benefited from a partial recovery in the
slumping bond market, which pushed the yield on the key 30-year
Treasury bond back under 9 percent. That made bonds less attractive
as an alternate investment to stocks.
   The NYSE's composite index of all listed issues rose 0.94 to
147.71. The American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 0.69
to 301.61.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.81 points to
2,008.12.
   Gaining and losing issues were about even in NYSE composite
trading, with 771 up, 765 down and 460 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 144.65 million shares, against 234.16 million shares traded
in the previous session.

   Attention shoppers, it's time for a quick
quiz.
   A customer goes into a large discount store hoping to save a
bundle on running shoes. He finds that the prices are indeed
slashed, but there are eight different kinds to choose from.
   What should he do?
   A. Buy the pair that looks the most sophisticated.
   B. Try to find a sales clerk who may know slightly more than him
about running shoes.
   C. Leave the store confused.
   D. All of the above.
   Consumers across the country, whether they're shopping for shoes
or kitchen appliances, are coming up with all of those and other
equally unfulfilling answers.
   ``You almost have to know everything there is to know about a
product before you go into a store,'' said James Tiernan, executive
director of the Chicago-based American Consumers Association.
   Consumer frustration is one reason a tiny Rochester-based
computer company has introduced a curious new machine into
supermarkets around the country to help the confused, the tired and
the busy shopper.
   Inter-Ad, a private firm, sells computers that can be used to
give directions in the store, to print out recipes or coupons or to
offer food preparation instruction, all with a touch of a finger.
   ``We've seen a trend away from the traditional homemaker to
two-career families and these are people who have less time to
shop,'' said Michael Mizesko, Inter-Ad's director of marketing.
``Convenience has become more important than price now and these
machines are part of that.''
   These machines and others like them may be the answer of the
future for the baffled consumer, according to two Rochester
Institute of Technology professors, who are doing research in the
``consumer computer'' field.
   Having computers as sales people is something that has attracted
the attention of many large companies, said Dan Joseph and Thomas
Williams.
   The idea, they say, is to program computers to analyze various
consumer decisions _ like ``What kind of motor oil do I need?'' or
``How much will these denim jeans stretch?'' _ and provide some
guidance.
   The professors say these so-called ``expert systems'' are going
to be popping up in all kinds of stores over the next five years.
   ``People are getting tired of hearing `I don't know, I just work
here.' They don't want to be at the mercy of that kind of
salesperson,'' said Joseph.
   The two researchers are putting the finishing touches on a
system to help people choose a personal computer. They also have a
program on the drawing board to offer advice on running shoes.
   Joseph said he hopes to set up his ``expert computer
consultant'' in the school bookstore by the end of the summer and
see how it fares. Eventually, he would like to put it in computer
stores around the country.
   The idea of using computers to analyze problems and offer advice
is not new, but so far they have been used mostly in industrial or
scientific applications.
   The first system, created in the early 70s, was called Mycin and
it served the medical profession offering diagnoses of various
bacterial blood infections, Joseph said. The only problem was that
it took a whole day to get one diagnosis.
   Since then, however, expert systems have been greatly improved
and are used to diagnose problems in auto engines, to predict where
veins of valuable mineral deposits are, and to offer advice to oil
drillers.
   ``The time has come to make the jump to the consumer,'' said
Joseph.
   Inter-Ad has machines in several hundred stores in 75 different
supermarket chains in 32 states and Canada. The store directory is
the most popular model, with a cuisine machine, which offers videos
of how to carve a turkey or clean a fish, found in about half as
many stores.
   Last year, Inter-Ad introduced ``The Information Station'' which
combines the two machines and also prints coupons and can be used
for in-store advertising.
   That system is being tested by the Cincinnati-based Kroger Co.,
which is using it in seven stores. Other chains are also using the
system, Mizesko said.
   The machines cost from $7,000 to $12,000, he said.
   Eventually, the 6-year-old Inter-Ad company that President James
Odorczyk started in his home after resigning from Xerox Corp. hopes
to use its video kiosks to serve as a national in-store advertising
network.
   Tiernan, the consumer advocate, warned that the potential use of
these ``expert systems'' as advertising vehicles is the biggest
drawback they have, although he estimated that overall they would
be a service rather than a sales gimmick for shoppers.
   ``But you still have to remember if the store manager says he's
got an extra shipment of basil he needs to sell, you might see a
whole lot of recipes calling for fresh basil,'' Tiernan said.

<HEAD>First City: Tender Offer Successful</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH RENDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of First City Bancorporation of Texas
announced today that the company's tender offer for debt holders to
submit their securities was successful, paving the way for a $1.6
billion federal bailout plan.
   Last month, the company _ which officially becomes the First
City Acquisition Corp. under the plan _ lowered the required
participation level from 90 percent to 70 percent.
   In making today's announcement, however, company officials
declined to confirm that senior and subordinated debt holders had
surrendered 70 percent of the bank holding company's debt.
   First City officials announced last week they planned to
complete the deal by today. A Monday afternoon deadline, the
company's sixth, passed without word from First City on whether the
company had completed the last obstacle to finish the
reorganization plan.
   As of last week, 66.1 percent, or $149.3 million, of the bank's
$225.8 million in bonds had been tendered. First City needs at
least $158 million of the outstanding debt tendered to complete the
deal.
   Chicago investor A. Robert Abboud's effort to rescue
Houston-based First City with the help of $970 million from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has been slowed by bondholders'
reluctance to part with the debt.
   First City senior debt holders have been offered 45 cents on the
dollar for their debt, while subordinated debt holders have been
offered 35 cents.
   Bonds not tendered by the deadline become the obligation of the
revitalized First City and would be worth more than what Abboud is
offering.
   The bailout plan, announced in September, calls for $970 million
in assistance from the FDIC, a spinoff of $1.79 billion in book
value of poorly performing assets and $500 million infusion of
capital raised privately by a group headed by Abboud.
   Also on Monday, CNN Business News reported that Abboud has
agreed to put up more than $500 million in private money through
new stock underwritten by Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities
Corp. The report said Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has pledged $100
million _ under certain conditions _ as part of that sum.
   A First City spokesman said he was not aware of Drexel Burnham
Lambert's involvment with Abboud. Calls to the New York investment
company from The Associated Press were not returned.
   First City, with 59 banks in Texas and one in South Dakota, grew
quickly during the Texas oil boom, but was hit by energy and real
estate losses when oil prices plummeted.
   For 1987, the state's fourth-largest bank holding company posted
a $1.1 billion loss.
   In a 10K report filed late last month with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, First City reported it expected to lose $43
million by the time the reorganization is completed.
   If the First City doesn't redeem enough bonds, the FDIC says it
will resort to an alternative that will hurt bondholders more than
Abboud's proposal.
   The FDIC won't say what the alternatives are, but analysts
suspect the agency would declare First City insolvent, seize it
under its emergency powers and then turn it over to Abboud. If that
happens, bondholders would get wiped out.
   Another alternative would be to declare First City bankrupt and
negotiate with bondholders in court.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices opened narrowly
mixed today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybean futures showed no clear trend either higher or lower.
Higher soybean oil prices provided some impetus on the positive
side, but lower values for soybean meal exerted downward pressure.
   Soybean traders have been keeping a close watch on the Brazilian
soybean harvest, which was reportedly about 55 percent complete as
of last Friday, said Dale Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   ``That's compared to 45 percent last year and a normal of 50
percent, so it's proceeding about on average,'' he said.
   Corn and wheat prices were nearly unchanged in early trading.
Some observers had expected wheat prices to fall in reaction to
sluggish export sales and the government's auction sale last Friday
of 11.2 million bushels of surplus wheat.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to } cent higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.11{ a bushel; corn was unchanged
to \ cent higher with May at $2.03} a bushel; oats were 1 cent to
1\ cents higher with May at $1.65} a bushel; soybeans were } cent
lower to { cent higher with May at $6.65} a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .60 cent higher with April at 74.50
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to .50 cent higher with
April at 79.30 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to .40 cent
higher with April at 44.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.20 cent to .50 cent higher with May at 52.15 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed mostly lower on Monday.

<HEAD>Futures Prices Fade After Runup On Persian Gulf Fighting</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 6 grafs to UPDATE with morning activity; uppicks

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices dropped sharply today, as
profit-taking continued in the wake of the runup that erupted on
Monday's explosion of U.S.-Iran fighting in the Persian Gulf.
   In midday trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, stood at $18.12 per
42-gallon barrel, down 15 cents from Monday's closing price.
   May contracts for wholesale unleaded gasoline were trading at
52.40 cents per gallon, down 0.90 cent, while wholesale heating oil
contracts were down 0.85 cent at 49.65 cents per gallon.
   Analysts said selling hit the market from the start, continuing
a trend that began early Monday afternoon.
   Anticipating that diminished Middle East oil supplies might send
prices higher, many traders rushed to buy Monday despite widespread
realization that any shortfall could easily be diminished by other
world producers, analysts said.
   As a result, when the initial excitement died down, prices
slipped back because of profit-taking and technical factors, they
said.
   U.S. Navy vessels destroyed two offshore Iranian oil platforms,
sank a defending Iranian patrol boat and bombed two Iranian navy
frigates in retaliation for a mine attack that nearly sank a U.S.
vessel. Iran attacked oil facilities off Sharjah and fired on at
least two U.S. vessels.
   Jayne Ball, an analyst at the Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
investment firm, said prices soared on those reports, even though
``there's an overall recognition that if you shut down the Gulf,
there's not so big an impact'' on world oil supplies, because of
the number of other producers has grown.
   But the markets still worry to the point that ``anything that
happens in that area has got to have an impact on prices,'' she
added.
   Ms. Ball said the failure of the May crude contract to move
above $19 discouraged traders, who then began the afternoon selloff.
   The May crude contract expires at Wednesday's close, and so ``a
lot of people took advantage of the higher prices and sold off,''
said Stephen J. McKiernan, president of the McKiernan & Co.
commodities trading firm.

<HEAD>Phillip Morris Posts 31 Percent Profit Gain in 1st Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip Morris Companies Inc., the tobacco, food
and brewing giant, said Tuesday its first-quarter profit rose 30.1
percent on a 10.4 percent increase in revenue.
   The company makes Marlboro cigarettes, Jell-O pudding, Oscar
Mayer meats, Maxwell House coffee and Miller beers. It also has a
financial services unit.
   The company said its profit rose to $502 million, or $2.12 a
share, in the three months ended March 31, up from $386 million, or
$1.62 a share, a year earlier.
   Operating revenue rose to $7.24 billion in the quarter from
$6.55 billion a year earlier.
   Chairman Hamish Maxwell said the company's domestic cigarette
operations had higher operating revenue on higher cigarette unit
volume despite an industrywide volume decline in the quarter.
   Internationally, operating revenue and volume of cigarettes were
up strongly for the period, Maxwell said.
   He said the General Foods division reported higher unit volume
in the quarter, while operating revenue was flat due to a decline
in the domestic coffee business. Domestic results of the division
were helped by gains in baked goods and the introduction of new
Jell-O ready-to-eat puddings.
   The Oscar Mayer operations posted strong volume gains and slight
revenue increases for the quarter as the brand increased its market
share in hot dogs, bacon and sliced luncheon meats, the statement
said.
   The Miller Brewing operation reported that higher barrel volume
and price increases led to higher operating revenue for the quarter.
   Philip Morris Credit Corp. posted higher revenue as well,
Maxwell said.

<HEAD>Firm Will Be Dissolved Because of Partner's Boesky-Related
Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jamie Securities Co. will be dissolved due to
legal problems of managing partner John Mulheren, arrested on
charges he tried to kill insider trader Ivan Boesky, sources close
to the stock speculation firm said Tuesday.
   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said
Jamie officials agreed they should disband it because of Mulheren's
incapacitation.
   Fred Stone, Jamie's general counsel, confirmed that ``Jamie is
in the process of dissolution'' but would not elaborate on why.
   Officials at the New York Stock Exchange and American Stock
Exchange said Tuesday that Jamie resigned its membership from both
exchanges April 7.
   Once one of Wall Street's most aggressive speculators in stocks
of companies targeted for rumored and actual takeovers, Jamie had
more than $300 million under management.
   Jamie's activities have declined sharply since Mulheren,
carrying a loaded rifle, was seized by police Feb. 18 outside his
Rumson, N.J. home and charged with threatening to kill Boesky and
Boesky's former trader Michael Davidoff.
   Both men were said to have implicated Mulheren in a Wall Street
corruption scandal that centers around Boesky, formerly a
flamboyant speculator who traded stocks based on illegal inside
information. Boesky is now in a federal prison.
   Mulheren, who suffers from manic depression, has been in a New
Jersey private psychiatric hospital since March 10, when a federal
court denied a government motion to keep him jailed because of
claims that he is dangerous.
   He is said to be under investigation by both the Securities and
Exchange Commission and a federal grand jury.
   The government has submitted an affidavit to a federal
magistrate in Manhattan that says prosecutors and Mulheren's
attorneys are talking about disposing of the case, which has led to
speculation that plea bargaining is taking place.
   Otto Obermaier, Mulheren's chief attorney, said in response that
``the prosecution and defense in all cases talk about a variety of
topics, including possible resolution of their differences and also
possible preparation for trial.''

<HEAD>Britain Approves NASDAQ as Recognized Exchange</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's Department of Trade and Industry on
Tuesday gave regulatory approval to the National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ), the U.S.
electronic stock trading system for over-the-counter stocks.
   The department approval means trading of U.S. and foreign stocks
on NASDAQ can continue in London after April 29, when Britain's
1986 Financial Services Act becomes effective.
   NASDAQ is the first overseas exchange to get recognized
investment exchange status under the act.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers Inc. (NASD),
which operates and regulates the NASDAQ market, hopes to expand its
London membership from about 80 firms currently to about 160 firms,
trading the 4,700 U.S. and foreign stocks that are listed on
NASDAQ, said Joseph R. Hardiman, NASD's president.
   Hardiman said he also wants more European companies to issue
American Depositary Receipts _ U.S.-traded equivalents of European
shares _ through NASDAQ.
   NASD hopes to broaden cooperation with London's Stock Exchange,
he said. It hopes to set up a system that will allow small orders
of stock entered though the one exchange to be executed in the
other, he said.
   ``Today we have the technical and now the legal ability to
create what amounts to a trans-Atlantic stock market,'' Hardiman
said.

<HEAD>Harvey Mackay Shows How to Swim with the Sharks and Survive</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARREN MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At age 26, on his way to becoming a
best-selling author, Harvey Mackay bought a failing envelope
company with 12 employees, annual sales of $200,000 and a few
pieces of broken-down equipment.
   He didn't change the company's name to Mackay Envelope Corp. for
2{ years, he says, ``because I didn't want the Mackay name on it if
I went bankrupt.''
   Today that company has 350 employees, sales of approximately $35
million and modern plants in both Minnesota and Iowa, and for the
past 10 years Mackay has traveled around the world giving seminars
for other businesses.
   Now the 55-year-old Minneapolis businessman has written a book
outlining his philosophy on how to become successful and the
insights he's gleaned from his experiences.
   ``Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive'' was published
March 23. By mid-April, 150,000 copies had been sold, the book was
on back order and was No. 2 on the New York Times best-seller list
in the ``how-to'' category.
   The book's success was no accident.
   ``I traveled around the country visiting bookstores and talking
with people in the industry'' before starting to write the book two
years ago, Mackay said.
   His research showed many books fail because they aren't
available in the bookstores. So when he went to William Morrow &
Co. Inc. in New York to talk about a contract, he asked for a first
printing of 100,000 copies.
   ``I'm an unknown, first-time author from the flyover state of
Minnesota. I wanted to make sure there were enough,'' he remembers
with the dry wit characteristic of the book.
   But Mackay also was prepared to show Morrow officials how he
could help them.
   ``I told them I knew about 2,000 presidents and chief executive
officers of major companies throughout the United States and said I
would mail the book to those people,'' Mackay said.
   ``They had to know I had made a personal commitment to help them
market the book,'' he said. Mackay told them he was willing to take
time off from his business for an extended book tour and said he
would put on a two-hour seminar for the company's sales force.
   During the seminar, ``I would not talk about my book,'' he said.
But the presentation meant the sales force would know Mackay, and
those same sales people would then be selling his book to the
bookstores.
   ``It was a two-way street _ good for them and a big break for
me,'' he said.
   When the contract was written, Mackay had a $150,000 budget for
promotion, a six-figure advance (he won't disclose the exact
amount) and a 100,000 first printing.
   After he began writing, Mackay was invited to bring his
manuscript and address a publishing course at Stanford University.
One of the professors made his first draft mandatory reading for
the class, Mackay said, giving him free feedback from the 85
students.
   Once the manuscript was completed, Mackay sent copies to nearly
50 well-known friends asking them to read it and drop him a line
telling him what they thought.
   ``I was hoping for three or four responses,'' Mackay said.
   Forty-five responded _ including former President Gerald Ford,
former Vice President Walter Mondale, newsman Ted Koppel, feminist
Gloria Steinem, Notre Dame football Coach Lou Holtz, actors Robert
Redford and Eddie Albert, advice columnist Abigail (Dear Abby) Van
Buren, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, Baseball Commissioner Peter
Ueberroth and evangelist Billy Graham.
   Their praises of ``Swim With the Sharks'' are printed on the
first 15 pages before the title page.
   ``The book is about preparing to win, preparing to be
successful, changing the probability, leveling the playing field so
you have the highest probability going for you to succeed,'' Mackay
said. ``There are all kinds of people who are really trying but are
spinning their wheels.''
   However, he stresses the difference between being successful and
getting rich.
   ``I believe a successful person is one who measures the standard
of his or her own performance by their own potential,'' said
Mackay, the top-ranked tennis player in his age group in Minnesota
and a self-described ``language junkie'' who speaks Chinese,
Japanese and Arabic.
   ``Measuring your success by the standards of others doesn't
work, he quips, because ``every time you catch up with the Joneses,
they refinance.''
   The cornerstone of the book is a 66-question customer profile
which Mackay developed for his own sales people to use to ``become
a colleague of the people you're dealing with'' and to help make
sales.
   The profile includes detailed information on the person's
education, family and business background, special interests and
lifestyle.
   But Mackay stressed that sincerity is important in dealing with
people. ``You might fool someone in the short term, but not in the
long term,'' he said.
   The book, now in its seventh printing, was written primarily to
help people, but also as a legacy for his three grown children,
said Mackay, whose wife, Carol Ann, has been accompanying him on
the book tour.
   ``There is no greater reward in life than to be able to help
another human being. Period. That's what turns me on,'' he said.
   While Mackay had the money and the connections to promote his
book, he says it isn't necessary to have money to make money.
   ``You can take my money, put me in Tucumcari, N.M., with
nothing, and I can do it again,'' Mackay said. ``Anyone can do it
if they want to do it.''

<HEAD>Inflation Hits New High In First Quarter Of 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

   Retail prices rose faster than average incomes in
some cities in the first quarter of 1988 and the nationwide
inflation rate hit 11 percent, the government announced Tuesday.
   The inflation rate, up from a national average of 7.3 percent in
1987, is the highest the government has reported since senior
leader Deng Xiaoping began reducing central planning and price
controls in favor of market reforms in 1978.
   In 32 large and medium-size cities, retail prices rose 13.4
percent, the State Statistical Bureau said, while average per
capita incomes in urban areas only rose 13 percent, to more than 90
yuan, or $24, per month.
   Average per capita income for rural residents rose 25 percent,
to 50 yuan, or $13.50 per month.
   Top officials have acknowledged widespread popular discontent
over the rising prices and have announced corrective measures.
   But they also have warned that inflation will remain high for
several years as China strives to develop its backward economy and
allow market factors to set prices.
   Zhang Zhongji, director of the statistic bureau's Department of
Integrated Statistics of the National Economy, told a news
conference that the industrial sector maintained its rapid growth
in the first quarter, with output up 16.7 percent from the same
period last year, to the equivalent of $71.5 billion.
   Industrial output grew 16.5 percent during all of 1987.
   Vice Premier Yao Yilin, head of the State Planning Commission,
told a recent news conference that the government's goal was to
keep inflation below 10 percent, but added: ``Whether we will be
able to achieve it I can't tell you.''
   His cautious assessment reflected the difficulty of the
government's task: to cool demand that is pushing prices up without
curbing much-needed economic growth.
   Uncontrolled investment in often irrational and competing
projects and inadequate supplies of such goods as televisions and
refrigerators have contributed to inflation.
   The government has blamed inadquate investment in agriculture
for high food prices and short supplies of meat in the cities.
   Zhang said grain production was expected to remain about the
same as last year, or 400 million tons. Despite repeated calls to
stress grain production, China has been unable to repeat its record
1984 harvest of 407 million tons.

<HEAD>Alcoa Earnings Nearly Quadruple</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alumunum Co. of America said Tuesday that high
demand for the lightweight metal and strong revenues worldwide
helped to nearly quadruple first-quarter earnings to $178.7
million, or $2.02 per share.
   ``Alcoa's fundamentals remain strong worldwide,'' said Chairman
Paul O'Neill. ``Customers do not appear to be building inventory.
The January price increase in aluminum beverage can sheet, Alcoa's
largest volume product, is holding.''
   He said the company expects favorable market conditions and
operating fundamentals to continue.
   The nation's largest aluminum producer reported 1987
first-quarter net earnings of $49.5 million, or 56 cents per share.
   Sales increased 18 percent to $2.1 billion from $1.8 billion,
and shipments rose 2 percent to 536,000 metric tons from 527,000
metric tons.
   The quarter was supported by price increases on most products
and more efficient production rates, although the costs of
purchased metal, particularly used aluminum beverage cans, are
rising, O'Neill said.
   ``With higher prices for ingot and alumina, earnings for Alcoa
of Australia and from Alcoa Aluminio in Brazil accounted for 20
percent of Alcoa's first-quarter earnings in spite of currency
losses of $18.5 million from these two companies,'' he said.
   Alumina is an intermediary form of aluminum during the refining
and smelting processes.
   Pittsburgh-based Alcoa operates 97 facilities around the world,
employing about 55,000 workers.

   Vice President George Bush recently pressured
Labor Department officials to allow companies to avoid the expense
of ventilating toxic gases from the workplace by making workers
wear less effective, but cheaper, respirators instead, a Senate
committee was told today.
   As a result, proposed standards are being prepared for White
House approval that would allow greater use of personal respirators
for short-term exposure to toxic substances or when the cost of a
cleanup is considered ``excessive,'' scientists with the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration testified.
   The changes were first advocated five years ago by the Task
Force on Regulatory Relief chaired by Bush and were pushed by the
vice president in a meeting last month with officials of the Labor
Department, the scientists said.
   Dr. Sheldon W. Weiner, deputy director of health standards for
OSHA, and John Martonik, the agency's director of standards
analysis, said OSHA had effectively resisted the idea until January.
   ``There is no way in my view that respirators can be as
protective,'' Weiner said.
   Martonik agreed with that assessment but said the proposed
regulations, nontheless, were sent to the White House with the
changes called for by Bush's task force.
   ``It was a waste of our time as far as I`m concerned,'' Martonik
told the Senate Labor Committee. ``We had to tie up five years
working on this.''
   The committee was told Monday that between 50,000 and 70,000
Americans are dying from occupational illnesses each year because
the Reagan administration has delayed new job health regulations
and has not enforced existing standards.
   Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, director of environmental and
occupational medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City,
offered those statistics Monday and estimated another 350,000
workers incur illnesses each year because of inaction by the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   John Moran, former director of safety research at the National
Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, said 2,000 workers
have been killed in so-called ``confined space'' accidents alone
since 1980, when government safety officials first proposed a
regulation to address the problem.
   ``The proposed standard has never left the Department of
Labor,'' Moran told the Senate Labor Committee, which opened three
days of hearings into what Chairman Edward M. Kennedy called ``the
fiddling away of workers' lives'' by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration.
   The confined space regulation recommended by OSHA safety experts
in 1980 was intended to address the high incidence of workers who
are electrocuted or otherwise killed or injured because there is
not enough room to maneuver around dangerous equipment.
   Kennedy, D-Mass., vowed to develop a hearing record this week
showing that ``the decision to let workers die while waiting on a
standard or an inspection has been carried out by the highest
levels of this administration.''
   Assistant Labor Secretary and OSHA Administrator John
Pendergrass is scheduled to testify Wednesday before the panel,
which has had its staff investigating the agency for more than a
year.
   Terry Mikelson, an OSHA spokesman, called the figures of
Landrigan and Moran ``amazing numbers'' and said agency officials
would have no further comment until they appear before Kennedy's
committee on Wednesday.
   Landrigan testified Monday that occupational exposures to toxic
substances _ ``almost all of them arising out of manmade conditions
and therefore preventable'' _ are raising mortality rates for
certain forms of cancer.
   As an example, he said OSHA's decision not to reduce allowable
exposures to benzene until 1987 will result in 19 to 65 leukemia
deaths that otherwise would not occur. He said the agency had the
scientific evidence in 1981 to justify the reduction.
   Another seven to 48 workers will develop cancer and at least
5,900 more will contract respiratory ailments because OSHA delayed
for five years recommended reductions in formaldehyde exposures,
Landrigan said.

<HEAD>Iacocca Made $17 Million In 1987</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: AMs planned.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca
received $17.9 million in 1987, most of it by cashing in on stock
options that were granted when Chrysler was in financial trouble,
Chrysler reported in its proxy statement Tuesday.
   Iacocca was the nation's highest-paid executive in 1986.
   The proxy, which was mailed Tuesday to shareholders, said $13.5
million of Iacocca's 1987 earnings came when he cashed in stock
options he was granted early in the decade when Chrysler stock was
worth a fraction of its present value.
   He also received a $766,000 salary, $725,000 in a cash bonus,
$248,990 in a stock bonus and a stock grant worth $2.7 million.
   In 1986, Iacocca earned $20.6 million, including $9.6 million in
exercised stock options and nearly $1 million in cash bonuses.
   Chrysler's No. 2 executive, Gerald Greenwald, chairman of
Chrysler's automaking business, earned nearly $6.6 million in 1987.
That included $5.3 million in exercised stock options.
   The United Auto Workers scheduled a news conference for later
Tuesday, at which union Vice President Marc Stepp was expected to
blast Chrysler for paying such high salaries and bonuses to
executives.
   The union last week criticized General Motors Corp. and Ford
Motor Co. for similar 1987 payments to its executives.
   As national contract talks between the UAW and Chrysler opened
Monday, Chrysler announced that it no longer will pay bonuses to
executives in years when profits are too low to award
profit-sharing to hourly workers.

<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., a bottling company
spawned by the Coca-Cola Co., said Tuesday its profit rose 82.2
percent in the first quarter of 1988.
   The company cited increased volume, improved operating
efficiencies and the inclusion of bottling company acquisitions
completed in the latter half of 1987 and the first quarter as well
as certain tax regulations for the improvement.
   The company was formed in 1986 from Coca-Cola-owned bottling
operations and continued to acquire and consolidate similar
companies around the country.
   Coca-Cola Enterprises, publicly traded since November 1986 but
49 percent owned by Coca-Cola, had net income of $12.9 million, or
9 cents a share, in the quarter ended March 31, compared to $7.1
million, or 5 cents a share, in the comparable quarter in 1987.
   First-quarter revenue rose 14.9 percent to $855.52 million from
$744.64 million a year earlier.
   The results include figures from the Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of
Memphis, Tenn., the Florida operations of the Coca-Cola Bottling
Co. of Miami and all of the Maryland and a portion of the Delaware
operations of the Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Delaware.
   Those operations were acquired on Jan. 29, but consolidated as
of Jan. 1.

   Stocks strengthened today, bolstered by a mild
rebound in the bond market and improved quarterly earnings of some
leading blue-chip companies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 26.69 points
to 2,034.81 as of 2 p.m. EDT.
   Gaining stocks outnumbered declines by more than 2-to-1 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,043 up, 444 down and 426 unchanged.
   The NYSE's composite index of all listed issues rose 1.34 to
148.11. The American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 0.95
to 301.87.
   But volume totaled a relatively moderate 148.11 million shares
with two hours of trading left, suggesting that many large-scale
investors remain reluctant to participate.
   ``I don't see any institutional buying,'' said Robert O'Toole,
manager of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
in New York. ``This is just a trader's market.''
   Stocks of some key components in the Dow average were partly
responsible for the gains. Merck rose 2\ to 160, Alcoa rose 3{ to
47 and Philip Morris rose 1[ to 88[. Those companies reported
higher first-quarter earnings.
   Other important stocks that comprise the Dow average also
gained. IBM rose 1} to 115}, American Telephone & Telegraph gained
{ to 26~, International Paper gained 2[ to 44| and General Electric
rose rose } to 40\.
   Wall Street further benefited from a partial recovery in the
slumping bond market, which pushed the yield on the key 30-year
Treasury bond back under 9 percent. That made bonds less attractive
as an alternate investment to stocks.

<HEAD>Auctioneer's Shareholders Trim Back Share Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sotheby's, the world's largest art auctioneer,
said Tuesday its shareholders would sell to the public fewer shares
at a cheaper price than previously planned, apparently because of
the volatile stock markets.
   The shareholders will raise a maximum of $116 million _ compared
with the earlier planned $187 million _ through the first public
sale of Sotheby's Holdings Inc.'s stock, the closely held company
said.
   Fiona Ford, a spokeswoman for Sotheby's, declined to provide a
reason for the substantial trimming down of the sale.
   However, the sale originally had been planned for October but
was postponed because of the stock markets' crash.
   Sotheby's said the shareholders would sell 5.5 million shares at
between $18 a share and $21 a share, raising a total of between $99
million and $116 million.
   The stock being sold will represent 22 percent of the company's
stock, it said.
   Sotheby's previously had said that 7.21 million shares would be
sold at between $23 a share and $26 a share for a total of between
$166 million and $187 million.
   U.S.-owned Sotheby's said 2.9 million shares would be offered
for sale in the United States, and 1.5 million shares in Britain,
on the same day in mid-May. The date hasn't been announced.
   A further 1.1 million shares are to be sold in the international
market, Sotheby's said.
   Alfred Taubman, a Michigan shopping mall tycoon, gained control
of Sotheby's in September 1983.

   Walt Disney Co. said Tuesday it has
acquired Childcraft Education Corp. for $52 million, a move that
will significantly expand Disney's mail-order business.
   Disney also said it plans to add 10 East Coast stores to the
corporation's fledgling retail operation.
   Disney currently operates three stores that are not on
amusement-park grounds, all in Southern California, according to
Steve Burke, vice president of Disney's consumer products division.
   Childcraft, based in New Jersey, was a good fit because its
target market is preschoolers who are loyal fans of Mickey Mouse,
Donald Duck and other characters from the Disney menagerie, Burke
said.
   Childcraft's mailing list also will help bolster Disney's
mail-order business. Last year, 2.8 million copies of the Walt
Disney Family Gift Catalog were mailed. This year, Disney plans to
mail 8 million copies, a spokesman said.
   The combined moves will expand by one-third Disney's smallest
division, consumer products, which licenses Disney characters and
runs retail operations.
   In 1987, the consumer products division reported earnings of
$167 million, about 6 percent of Disney's $2.9 billion in 1987
revenue. Last year Disney reported $97 million in operating income.
   ``These are two further steps in the growth of the division,''
Burke said. They ``fit in with a broader strategy of expanding our
consumer products business aggressively.''
   In the past seven months, Disney's retailing and licensing
division also struck a 10-year deal with Sears, Roebuck and Co.,
the nation's largest retailer, to develop and sell new products.
Disney also signed a marketing deal with Mattel, the nation's
second-largest toymaker, to market infant and preschool toys.

   Share prices closed higher Tuesday in light
trading on the London Stock Exchange, boosted by a strong
performance in early trading in New York.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished up
11.1 points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,798.9.
   The index had declined as much as 3 points in lackluster early
morning trading.
   Volume was light at 419.4 million shares, down slightly from
423.7 million on Monday.
   Shares traded in a narrow range throughout the morning amid a
lack of fresh market-moving news and uncertainty about whether the
British pound would continue its recent rise.
   But investors snapped out of their lethargy once Wall Street
opened strongly higher. A slight rise in the dollar and a drop in
the pound also buoyed sentiment, dealers said.
   ``There wasn't much business, but what little there was was
quality,'' one dealer said. Institutional buyers went after the
major stocks, including shares of big pharmaceutical and electrical
companies, he said.

   But volume totaled a relatively moderate 128.34 million shares
with an hour of trading left, suggesting many investors remain
reluctant to participate in a market still scarred by the epic

   ``I don't see any institutional buying,'' said Robert O'Toole,
manager of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
in New York. ``This is just a trader's market.''
   Hugh Johnson, senior vice president of the First Albany Corp.
brokerage, said the market's strength today reflected a gradual
recovery from the shock of last week, when an unexpected bulge in
the trade deficit sent prices tumbling.
   Nevertheless, he said, the sluggish trading level showed that
``you still have a lot of uncertainty in the market. A lot of small

sidelines.''

   Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade and grains followed suit,
reflecting concern that supply problems may surface next fall.
   The Agriculture Department's report on spring planting
intentions is now nearly three weeks old but continues to have an
impact on the market, especially on soybean prices, said Ted Mao,
an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   The report indicated that soybean acreage would increase this
year by about 1 percent. Analysts said that with only a slight
increase in acreage, weather conditions could play an unusually
large role in the size of the harvest.
   The corn market faces a similar scenario, and early signs of
dryness in the western corn belt may have touched off some buying
interest Tuesday, Mao said.
   ``It's certainly much too early to be too concerned about
weather,'' he said. ``But since it looks like the overall acreage
base is going to be small this year, the market may be more
sensitive to early weather problems.''
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.14{ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents
to 3 cents higher with May at $2.05\ a bushel; oats were 2 cents to
3} cents higher with May at $1.68{ a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents

mid-range computer line that analysts said was designed to head off
expected product introductions by rival International Business
Machines Corp.
   Digital officials said the new VAX 6200 series is designed to
compete with IBM's existing 9370 and 4381 computers.
   Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., is the world's second-largest
computer company and considered the industry leader in
mid-performance range computers.
   The announcement of the VAX 6200 series came one week after
Digital reported a 0.8 percent decrease in profits for the latest
quarter while IBM announced a 16.3 percent rise, reversing a
two-year trend in the battle between the companies.
   The new computers, which will cost between $131,600 and
$653,200, will be available immediately, Digital said.
   ``The new systems are positioned squarely in the middle of the
VAX family and complement our current offerings,'' William R.
Demmer, Digital's vice president of mid-range systems, said in a
statement.
   Digital introduced several mainframe computers in its VAX 8800
series last month in a direct challenge to IBM. Last year the
company unveiled its MicroVAX 3000 series designed for small
departments.
   Analysts said the announcement was a strong tactical move for
Digital because the company needed to upgrade its mid-range line
before a rumored IBM development in the field.
   ``It's a good move for DEC,'' said Bruce Watts of Needham & Co.
``It's partly intended to place them in a strongly competitive
position when IBM announces its code-named Silverlake products this
summer.''
   ``DEC is getting their products out into the market first in
order to prevent IBM from taking customers away,'' he said.
   The company said the single-processor 6210 computer provides 2.8
times the performance of its VAX 11@780 system. The system can
accommodate up to four processors at once.
   Upgrades will cost betweem $100,200 and $173,500, Digital said.
   Digital's earnings in its third fiscal quarter ending March 26
totaled $305.1 million, or $2.33 a share, down from $307.6 million,
or $2.29 a share, one year earlier.
   The company had reduced its earnings estimates for the quarter
because of sluggish sales of expensive computer systems and a shift
in demand to smaller lines.
   Digital on Tuesday also announced a new version of its VMS
software and a new FORTRAN version for symmetric multiprocessing.
   Meanwhile, IBM on Tuesday announced upgraded software to take
advantage of design changes in its mainframe computers.

<HEAD>Earnings Rise at Wang, Amdahl, Microsoft, Lotus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Microsoft Corp. built up its lead over Lotus Development Corp.
in revenue and profits in the latest quarter, although both
personal computer software companies announced strong gains Tuesday.
   Among computer makers, Amdahl Corp. reported higher profits and
Wang Laboratories Inc. said its earnings jumped although sales rose
a modest 3 percent.
   Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash., said its net income rose 95
percent to $37.3 million, or 67 cents a share in its third fiscal
quarter, from $19.1 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 65 percent to $161.8 million from $98.4 million a year
earlier.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Microsoft said its
profit rose 72 percent to $93.9 million, or $1.68 a share, from
$54.6 million, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 71
percent to $420.4 million from $246.1 million.
   Lotus, of Cambridge, Mass., said its profit rose 34 percent to
$18.3 million, or 40 cents a share, in the first quarter, from
$13.7 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 38
percent to $117.3 million from $84.8 million.
   Analysts last month cut Lotus' earnings estimates for 1988 after
the company announced plans to delay introduction of its Lotus
1-2-3 Release 3 spreadsheet software until the fourth quarter.
   Amdahl, the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based maker of mainframe computers
that use the same software as International Business Machines Corp.
mainframes, said its profit rose 71 percent to $43.2 million, or 81
cents a share, in the quarter ended March 25, from $25.2 million,
or 51 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 15 percent to
$367.7 million from $318.5 million.
   Wang, the Lowell, Mass.-based maker of minicomputers and
office-automation equipment, said its profit nearly quadrupled to
$22.7 million, or 14 cents a share, from $5.9 million, or 4 cents a
share, in its third fiscal quarter. Revenue rose 3 percent to
$767.9 million from $745.9 million.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Wang said it
posted a profit of $79.3 million, or 48 cents a share, in contrast
with a loss of $102.7 million in the same period a year earlier.
Revenue rose 12 percent to $2.25 billion from $2.01 billion.

<HEAD>Profit Up At GTE, MCI, Pacific Telesis, U S West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp. on Tuesday reported a record profit and
strong gains in long-distance calling volume in its first quarter.
Profits also rose at GTE Corp., Pacific Telesis Group and U S West.
   MCI, the No.2 long-distance carrier, based in Washington, D.C.,
said its profit more than doubled to $69 million, or 24 cents a
share, on revenue of $1.13 billion. That compared with earnings of
$25 million, or 9 cents a share, on revenue of $955 million for the
first quarter of 1987.
   MCI said its volume of calls was up 39 percent from a year ago
and had increased 14 percent when compared to the fourth quarter.
   GTE, the phone company based in Stamford, Conn., said its profit
rose 8 percent to $286 million, or 84 cents a share, from $265
million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7
percent to $3.9 billion from $3.7 billion.
   GTE owns local telephone companies that do business in 31 states
and is half-owner, with United Telecommunications Inc., of US
Sprint Communications Co. US Sprint is the nation's third-largest
long-distance carrier behind American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and
MCI.
   GTE's results were hurt by a first-quarter pre-tax loss of $138
million at US Sprint, which GTE shared equally with United
Telecommunications. US Sprint's revenue rose 23 percent to $759
million, while its pre-tax loss was 43 percent less than the
year-earlier loss.
   Pacific Telesis, the San Francisco-based holding company for
Bell telephone companies in the West, said its profit rose 28.2
percent to $300 million, or 71 cents a share, from $234 million, or
55 cents a share, a year ago.
   Revenue rose 7.9 percent to $2.31 billion from $2.14 billion a
year ago.
   U S West reported its profit rose 17.8 percent to $240.5
million, or $1.30 per share, from $204.2 million, or $1.08 per
share, in first quarter 1987. The 1987 quarter included one-time
charges of $30.2 million stemmnig from an early retirement plan and
refunds ordered by the state of Oregon.
   Revenue in the first quarter rose to $2.2 billion from $2.04
billion in first quarter 1987.
   U S West is the Denver-based holding company for Mountain Bell,
Pacific Northwest Bell, Northwestern Bell, plus companies involved
in directory publishing, cellular communications and other
communications and computer products.

   Honeywell Inc., citing strong profits in its
industrial business, on Tuesday reported its first-quarter earnings
rose 32 percent.
   The international control manufacturer and defense contractor
said it earned $57.7 million, or $1.36 per share, up from $43.7
million, or 96 cents per share, in the same period a year ago.
   The current quarter included $5 million in one-time gains
related to asset sales.
   The company said its worldwide sales in the first quarter
increased to $1.74 billion, compared with $1.48 billion in the
first three months of 1987.
   James J. Renier, Honeywell president and chief executive
officer, said total operating profit increased and was especially
strong in the company's industrial and homes and buildings
businesses. Operating profit also increased in defense and marine
systems, but declined in space and aviation systems, he said.
   Honeywell provides products, systems and services for the home
and building, industrial, space and aviation, and defense and
marine markets.
   The company has 79,000 employees worldwide, with 1987 sales of
$6.7 billion and net income of $254 million.

   Monsanto Co. on Tuesday reported a 52 percent
increase in first quarter earnings due to increased demand for its
herbicide and other agricultural products.
   Net income for the three months ended March 31 was $210 million,
or $2.86 a share, on revenue of $2.13 billion. That compared with a
profit of $138 million, or $1.76 a share, and $1.87 billion in
revenue last year.
   ``Strong demand for Roundup herbicide in new markets around the
world was, once again, the major contributor to an excellent
performance by agricultural products this quarter,'' Monsanto
Chairman Richard J. Mahoney said.
   He said the quarterly results also were boosted by the increased
sale of its Alimet animal feed supplement and U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency approval of the use of Lasso MicroTech herbicide
on corn.
   NutrSweet, Electronic Materials and Fsher Controls also showed
improved sales and margins in the first quarter. Operating income
for Fisher Controls declined, however, because of higher raw
material and other manufacturing costs, Mahoney said.

<HEAD>Dividend Payout, Sign Of Good Times</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. announced on Tuesday
plans to pay more than $24 million in overdue preferred stock
dividends and to sell 8 million shares of common stock to pare its
$1.7 billion unfunded pension liability.
   One Wall Street analyst said the dividends are a sign of
Bethlehem's faith in the steel industry's recovery after five years
of massive losses, plant closings and employment cuts.
   ``It shows more of a conviction that what is actually happening
in the steel markets is going to be more sustainable than most
observers believe,'' said Dick Henderson of Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette Securities Corp. of New York. ``Steel demand is strong,
pricing is strong, earnings are going to be strong.''
   The recovery seems ``very, very broad-based,'' he said. ``It
represents the participation of the steel industry in the so-called
reindustrialization of America.''
   Henderson said his enthusiasm for steel industry stocks,
especially Bethlehem's, runs counter to the market. He called
Bethlehem stock undervalued.
   ``People are looking at the recoveries in the industrial and
capital goods markets. They know it's happening, but they don't
believe it will continue,'' he said.
   Bethlehem reported profits in each quarter last year and $174
million profit for all of 1987. It was the first annual profit
since 1981, and during the interim, Bethlehem lost more than $2
billion.
   The steelmaker said Salomon Brothers Inc. has agreed to
underwrite the common stock offering, which follows last fall's
sale of 12 million common shares and would raise the number of
outstanding shares from the current 64.4 million to 72.4 million.
   Bethlehem stock fell $1.62{ per share to $19.37{ in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading after Tuesday's announcement.
   The company's board declared Monday that on June 10 shareholders
of record May 10 will be paid arrearages and second quarter
dividends of $6.25 per share and $3.12{ per share on Bethlehem's $5
and $2.50 cummulative convertible preferred issues respectively.
   Dividends worth $22.5 million were omitted for the second half
of 1986 and the first half of 1987.
   The board also said the company will pay dividends June 11 on
convertible preference shares issued to employees under contracts
with the United Steelworkers and other unions. The dividends will
be paid in additional shares with an aggregate stated value of $1.7
million. The dividend covers the period ending April 1.
   The payments do not cover common stock dividends, which have not
been paid since the board declared 10 cents per share for the third
quarter of 1985. Unlike the preferred issues, on which dividends
accumulate, the common issue does not require the company to pay a
dividend.
   Bethlehem said it would report first quarter income at its
annual shareholders meeting next Tuesday.

<DATELINE>RAHWAY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merck & Co. reported Tuesday that its first
quarter profit rose 35 percent over a year ago on strong sales of
its drug and health products.
   Net income for the three months ended March 31 totaled $271.4
million, or $2.06 a share, compared with earnings of $201.3
million, or $1.47 a share, in 1987. Sales jumped to $1.43 billion
from $1.11 billion.
   ``Sales growth for the quarter, a company record, was led by new
products,'' said Merck Chairman P. Roy Vagelos. ``Strong unit
volume gains were registered by both our domestic and international
operations.''
   He said the drop in the dollar against major foreign currencies
helped boost sales by lowering the price of Merck's products
overseas.

<HEAD>Japan May Soon Phase Out Citrus and Beef Quotas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan may begin phasing out quotas on U.S.
citrus and beef imports as early as next week to avoid rebuke by an
international panel, according to a top American trade official.
   Japan vetoed a U.S. request two weeks ago for a special
investigation of the quotas by the 92-nation General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, but the United States plans to push the issue at
GATT's next council meeting May 4.
   ``They know we will not allow a dispute panel to be blocked a
second time,'' Michael Samuels, deputy U.S. trade representative
and ambassador to the GATT, said in an interview with the San
Francisco Chronicle Monday.
   Japanese and American officials will discuss the matter next
week in Tokyo, and Samuels thinks Japan may be ready to agree to a
compromise.
   ``They may not want to go to GATT and be found `guilty' of
policy violations because that might offend their political
sensitivities at home,'' the ambassador said.
   Under a 1984 agreement that expired last month, Japan agreed to
admit 177,000 tons American beef and 86,400 tons of U.S. oranges
this year. Pressure from the powerful Japanese agriculture lobby
has prevented an elimination of the quotas.
   The United States wants a complete lifting of the quotas,
Samuels said, but the Reagan administration is willing to accept a
gradual elimination over a short period of time.

<HEAD>Judge Declares Mexican Airline Bankrupt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGIO CARRASCO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge declared government-owned
Aeromexico bankrupt and ordered it into receivership, leaving the
airline's more than 9,200 workers jobless Tuesday.
   The decision followed a strike by the airline's technical
workers that shut down the airline on April 12 in protest of
management plans to reduce the fleet and route system to bring
Aeromexico back into the black.
   The airline filed a petition for bankruptcy on Friday, saying it
was losing $1 million a day because of the strike.
   Civil Court Judge Sergio Higuera Mota issued the bankruptcy
decree late Monday, the Department of Communications and
Transportation announced.
   President Miguel de la Madrid said the bankruptcy petition was
not an isolated case but part of a new policy to sell, cut out or
close down all money-losing companies and agencies owned or
operated by the government.
   ``The country cannot give itself the luxury of having
inefficient enterprises, which constitute a burden to the entire
society,'' de la Madrid said at an appearance Monday in the
northern industrial city of Monterrey.
   Mexico has been suffering from acute inflation and other
economic ills since 1982, when international prices for oil, its
No. 1 export by far, first dropped.
   The strike had grounded all Aeromexico's 223 daily flights to 42
international and domestic destinations.
   The Aeromexico Technicians and Workers Union called the protest
strike after the airline's management announced plans to sell 13
aircraft, saying the sale would leave more than 2,000 ground
workers and cabin attendants without jobs.
   Pilots and cabin attendants have their own unions and did not
support the strike.
   Rene Arce, the union's president, said his organization would
fight to keep the airline alive and reiterated that it was
interested in trying to buy it. He said the union could muster the
support of a number of Mexican and foreign investors, but he did
not identify them.
   Arce estimated the airline would cost $200 million to purchase,
including $70 million in estimated severance pay to workers.
   In Monterrey, de la Madrid told reporters that from now on the
government ``will demand greater productivity, including some
radical re-structuring, as in the case of commercial aviation,''
from its hundreds of money-losing enterprises.
   Aeromexico started business in 1934 and has been owned by the
government since 1957. The strike and the bankruptcy have not
affected Mexicana de Aviacion, the other major Mexican airline,
which has been controlled by the government since 1982.
   Aeromexico employs 7,200 ground workers and technicians, 1,200
cabin attendants and 800 pilots.

   A mild stock rally fizzled late Tuesday,
overwhelmed by computerized selling strategies and anxiety that has
afflicted investors since the historic crash exactly six months ago.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip stocks, up more than 32
points at midafternoon, slid in the final hours and finished down
8.62 to 1,999.50, back under the 2,000 level for the first time in
two weeks. Most broader market indices also fell.
   ``People are willing to venture into the market on a day-by-day
basis, but not much longer,'' said Joseph Barthel, technical
analyst at the Butcher & Singer Co. investment firm. ``Without some
sort of clarification, I think we're doomed to this type of
whipsawed action.''
   The market strengthened through the early hours, largely because
of sharply higher earnings reported by some leading companies that
comprise the Dow average. A partial recovery in the slumping bond
market also helped by easing interest rates, thereby making bonds a
less attractive alternative to stocks.
   But bonds weakened in the afternoon on renewed fears of
inflation and fighting in the Persian Gulf. Traders said this
helped provide an excuse to bail out of stocks and erase the day's
gains.
   Some said the decline was speeded by index arbitrage program
trading, the controversial strategy of selling large amounts of
stocks and buying equivalent groups of stock-index futures, or vice
versa, to profit from price disparities.
   The result was a seesaw market dominated by professional
traders, as reflected in the relatively light New York Stock
Exchange volume of 161.91 million shares. On Monday the volume was
even lighter at 144.65 million shares.
   ``Volatility and uncertainty about the economy are keeping a lot
of people on the sidelines,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice
president of the First Albany Corp. brokerage.
   ``This is the six month anniversary,'' he said, referring to
Black Monday, Oct. 19. ``It just sort of makes me think that even
though it's six months later, we haven't come a long way.''
   The number of rising and falling stocks finished about even in
NYSE composite trading, with 789 up, 733 down and 466 unchanged.
Earlier in the day gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2-to-1.
   Among the most prominent blue chips, Aluminum Co. of America
jumped 3 to 46{. The company reported sharply higher first-quarter
earnings.
   Other notable stocks benefiting from higher corporate earnings
included Philip Morris, up | to 87|; Honeywell, up 1[ to 68~; and
Monsanto, up 1] to 81~.
   Bethlehem Steel fell 1| to 19]. The company said it had plans to
sell 8 million shares of common stock and apply the proceeds to its
$1.7 billion unfunded pension liability.
   The Wilshire Associates 5,000 Equity Index, the market value of
5,000 NYSE, American and over-the-counter issues, was $2.58
trillion, off $7.81 billion from Monday.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the OTC market, totaled
192.30 million shares.
   The NYSE composite index of all listed issues fell 0.60 to
146.17.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 1.55 to 300.50,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index fell 1.29 to 257.92.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 1 to
299.92. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
closed at 376.86, up 1.76.

<HEAD>Grain Markets Rally On Season's First Weather Scare</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices rallied Tuesday on the first
weather scare of the season even though spring planting has barely
begun.
   Soybeans advanced as much 7{ cents a bushel on the Chicago Board
of Trade and the grains weren't far behind as drought fears swept
the pits.
   On other markets, energy futures retreated; precious metals were
mixed; livestock and meat were mostly higher; and stock-index
futures retreated.
   ``I think we had our first weather scare'' on the Chicago Board
of Trade, said Steve Freed, grain analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   ``It's certainly much too early to be too concerned about
weather,'' said Ted Mao, grains specialist with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York. ``But since it looks like the overall
acreage base is going to be small this year, the market may be more
sensitive to early weather problems.''
   At the root of the dry-weather concerns was the Agriculture
Department's report on corn and soybean planting intentions. The
report, issued nearly three weeks ago, indicated only slight
increases in U.S. corn and soybean acreage.
   Analysts have said that because of the lower-than-expected
planting intentions, growing conditions even slightly less than
ideal could result in tight supplies of corn and beans.
   The USDA reported Tuesday that inadequate moisture was causing
problems for winter wheat growers in the central and northern
Plains. Wheat prices rallied on the news and nervous corn and
soybean traders reacted as if those crops were sprouted and
withering.
   ``We haven't even got the crop planted and we're already killing
it,'' Freed said.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 3 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in May at $3.14\ a bushel; corn was 1} cents to 3 cents
higher with May at $2.05{ a bushel; oats were 2\ cents to 3} cents
higher with May at $1.68{ a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 7{
cents higher with May at $6.72 a bushel.
   Profit-taking and technically inspired selling erased several
days' worth of gains in energy futures prices on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   ``There was not even a fairly good rumor today in the market
that I could find,'' to cause the sharp selloff, said Bob Baker, an
analyst in New York with Prudential Bache Securities Inc.
   Crude oil for May delivery plunged below $18.09 a barrel, the
price it settled at a week earlier. May unleaded gasoline
relinquished four days' worth of advances while May heating oil
erased two day's worth of gains.
   West Texas Intermediate heating oil settled 39 cents to 49 cents
lower with May at $18.03 a barrel; heating oil was .82 cent to 1.01
cents lower with May at 49.68 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.92 cent to 1.16 cents lower with May at 52.14 cents a gallon.
   Platinum futures also posted fairly steep losses on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Over on the Commodity Exchange, also in New
York, gold futures fell slightly while silver gained a bit.
   The $6.10 drop in July platinum to $535.70 a troy ounce was
``only some fine tuning of what clearly is a very strong market,''
said Richard Levine, vice president of Elders Futures Inc.'s
precious metals and foreign exchange group.
   ``Fundamentally, platinum is very strong,'' he said.
   Gold settled $1 to $1.60 lower with June at $460.40 a troy
ounce; silver was 1.8 cents to 2.9 cents higher with May at $6.465
a troy ounce.
   Most cattle and pork futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in response to higher cash prices, analysts said.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .72 cent higher with April at
74.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent lower to .45 cent
higher with April at 78.95 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower
to .38 cent higher with April at 44.70 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .08 cent lower to .90 cent higher with May at 52.10
cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures fell substantially on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 1.95 points lower at 257.30.

<HEAD>Dollar Edges Higher; Gold Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar moved marginally higher against all
major currencies except the Canadian dollar in light trading
Tuesday, continuing to draw support from tensions in the Persian
Gulf.
   Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid of $456.75 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from
$458.75 late Monday.
   Traders said the dollar got a lift from a drop in the British
pound. The pound, which has gained against all major currencies,
traded Monday at a six-year high against the dollar.
   But rumors began flying in earlier overseas markets that
``because of the strength of the pound, there was a potential for a
cut in British interest rates,'' said Robert Ryan, senior trader at
Irving Trust Co.
   Those rumors ``took the pound down like a bullet ... and the
dollar did better because of the weakness of the pound,'' he said.
   Tensions in the Persian Gulf, where U.S. and Iranian forces
clashed Monday, offered some support for the dollar. Iran attacked
two neutral ships and more mines were sighted in the gulf Tuesday.
   ``We're in a holding pattern with the Middle East tensions,''
said Earl Johnson, a trader at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in
Chicago.
   ``If those tensions fade into the background, we might see the
dollar slip ... because the underlying sentiment is still bearish
in the wake of the trade numbers,'' he said refering to last week's
report of a larger-than-epected February trade deficit.
   Trading was uneventful earlier in Europe, where the dollar also
edged marginally higher.
   Dealers there said a resumption of hostilities in the war-torn
gulf region would boost the dollar, but otherwise, worries about
the U.S. economy would resume downward pressure on the U.S.
currency.
   ``It may take another one or two weeks, but the dollar will
resume its downward trend,'' predicted a London-based trader for a
Japanese bank.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 124.37 Japanese yen from
123.78 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it slipped back to
124.20 yen. In New York the dollar closed at 124.27 yen, up from
124.23 yen on Monday.
   In London, the British pound fell back to $1.8930 from Monday's
six-year high of $1.9015. In New York it cost $1.8928 to buy one
pound, less expensive than Monday's $1.9050.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.66375 West German marks, up from 1.65975; 1.3760 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3735; 5.6590 French francs, up from 5.6370;
1,237.75 Italian lire, up from 1,233.375, and 1.22985 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.23205.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday: 1.6625
West German marks, up from 1.6615; 1.3752 Swiss francs, up from
1.3745; 5.6465 French francs, up from 5.6410; 1.8642 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8630; 1,235.75 Italian lire, up from 1,234.37;
1.2337 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2322.
   Meanwhile, on the New York Commodity Exchange, gold closed at
$458.40 a troy ounce, down from $459.40 on Monday.
   In London, gold fell to a late bid price of $456.50 an ounce,
from $459.25 bid late Monday. In Zurich, it dropped to $457 bid
from $458.50 bid late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell to a closing bid of $457.59
from $457.98 bid at Monday's close.
   Silver bullion closed at $6.451 a troy ounce on New York's
Comex, up from Monday's $6.422. In London silver fell to a late bid
of $6.46 a troy ounce, from $6.49 bid late Monday.

<HEAD>Court Upholds States' Power to Control Gasoline Prices, Profits</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 12th graf pvs, But he..., to add
industry comment.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the power
of states to control gasoline prices and oil industry profits in a
ruling that state officials say will help protect the public when
there are energy crises.
   The justices voted, 8-0, to reinstate regulations in Puerto Rico
that limit oil company profits and prevent an excise tax from being
passed on to consumers.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said the absence
of specific federal legislation on gasoline regulation leaves the
states free to adopt such rules.
   The ruling treats Puerto Rico, a commonwealth, as though it were
a state and applies to all states.
   Scalia rejected oil industry arguments that Congress, by
eliminating gasoline controls, mandated a free market in petroleum
products.
   There may be a ``general congressional desire'' favoring the
free market, he said.
   ``But unenacted approval, beliefs and desires are not laws,''
Scalia added. ``Without a text that can ... plausibly be
interpreted as prescribing federal pre-emption (of state power) it
is impossible to find that a free market was mandated by federal
law.''
   The ruling was hailed by Jeffrey C. Genzer, general counsel to
the National Association of State Energy Officials.
   ``The governors need the ability to respond quickly'' when there
are energy shortages, he said.
   ``I've heard it a million times. When they're standing in gas
lines or don't have enough home fuel, people come to the governor
or the state energy director,'' not to the federal government for
help, he added.
   Genzer said the ruling may not have great immediate impact
because there are no oil shortages now that require emergency state
action.
   But he said that without Tuesday's decision states could be
powerless, for example, to enforce so-called set-aside programs
requiring that a percentage of gasoline be reserved for
top-priority needs when there are shortages. Most states have laws
that give governors broad emergency powers to protect fuel supplies.
   The American Petroleum Institute said the ruling could have a
severe impact on the oil industry and the public if states adopt
regulations similar to those in Puerto Rico.
   ``The experience with price controls in the 1970s should serve
as a reminder that consumers are best served by free markets,'' the
industry group said in a statement.
   The Supreme Court ruling overturns a 1986 decision by a federal
appeals court here that said Congress intended to bar state
regulation of the oil industry when it lifted controls on gasoline
effective in 1981.
   Congress authorized the federal government in 1970 to place
controls on petroleum products in an effort to curb inflation. That
law expired in 1973.
   Congress, in the wake of an Arab oil embargo, then enacted an
emergency law placing extensive price and allocation controls on
gasoline.
   That was followed in 1975 by a new law aimed at promoting oil
conservation. The 1975 law was amended later to provide for gradual
deregulation and give the president sweeping authority to lift
controls selectively.
   Complete deregulation by the federal government was required as
of Sept. 30, 1981.
   Puerto Rico, which previously had suspended its regulation of
petroleum products while the federal controls were in effect,
placed an excise tax on oil refiners in 1986.
   The Puerto Rico Department of Consumer Affairs then issued
regulations requiring advance notice of price increases,
prohibiting wholesalers from passing on the cost of the excise tax
to retailers and imposing maximum profit margins on sales by
wholesalers to retailers.
   Puerto Rico's regulations, challenged in a lawsuit by oil
companies, were supported by the Reagan administration and state
and local officials. The National Governors' Association, the
National Association of Counties and the U.S. Conference of Mayors
were among the groups that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor
of Puerto Rico.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did not take part in Tuesday's
ruling.

   Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. on
Tuesday reported its first quarter earnings rose 30 percent as
sales and productivity increased and the dollar and taxes fell.
   3M said it earned $277 million, or $1.22 per share, up from $213
million, or 93 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Sales for the quarter rose to $2.6 billion from $2.21 billion.
   Allen F. Jacobson, chairman and chief executive officer, said
3M's U.S. and international businesses posted solid results.
Earnings benefited from double-digit worldwide unit growth,
increased productivity, weakening of the U.S. dollar and a lower
effective tax rate.
   Jacobson said 3M expects another year of higher sales and
earnings. ``While the outlook for the economy is somewhat
uncertain, we expect to benefit from a strong flow of new products,
as well as from continued emphasis on quality, productivity and
increased penetration of international markets,'' he said.
   ``In addition, the weaker dollar and a lower effective tax rate
will continue to aid results.''

<HEAD>Hancock Reaps Rewards For Marathon Sponsorship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Hancock Financial Services pumps $1 million
per year into the Boston Marathon. But the insurance conglomerate
figures it gets back at least $8.2 million in publicity due to
massive coverage of the event.
   ``The number of people reached is very impressive,'' Jack
Mahoney, John Hancock's special events director, said Tuesday.
   Two years ago, Hancock estimated conservatively that at least
some mention of its sponsorship of the race reached 750 million
people worldwide, which it said was the equivalent of roughly $8.2
million in advertising.
   The race on Monday ended in the closest finish in the 92-year
history of the Boston Marathon with Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya
crossing the finish line a second ahead of Juma Ikangaa of Tanzania.
   ``It was a great race,'' Mahoney said. ``The only thing that
could have been better would have been a dead heat.''
   Hancock is not alone in reaping the harvest of good will and
free publicity.
   Most of the major newspapers in the country carried photographs
of the runners. Ricoh Corp.'s name was emblazoned on the runners'
number tags.
   Coverage of the race was likely to mention that the men and
women winners got a Mercedes Benz.
   And any pictures from the finish area were likely to catch a
glimpse of the silver Mylar blankets bearing the Nestle@Chunky logo
that were given to each of the 6,700 runners.
   Hancock goes to great lengths to make sure there are no snags in
the transmitting of all that publicity.
   On race day, journalists occupied two large function rooms at
the Copley Plaza Hotel near the finish line. Part of the staff of
some 900 Hancock volunteers kept a steady flow of information
coming to the reporters from a Ricoh copier brought in for the
occasion. Camera crews and pool reporters moved ahead of the
leaders in a Mercedes Benz media truck.
   ``I still think it will grow in terms of media,'' said Mahoney.
Some 1,200 journalists covered the Marathon on Monday, he said.
   In the early 1980s, the question of whether the marathon would
have corporate sponsorship was debated hotly. Some argued that the
race should retain its amateur status but some race organizers were
concerned that Boston would be eclipsed as the premier marathon by
others offering prize money.
   Race Director Guy Morse of the Boston Athletic Association
doesn't miss the old days.
   ``We've been able to protect the Boston Marathon as a unique,
tradition-steeped event while at the same time bringing those
elements needed to make it among the best in the world,'' Morse
said.

<HEAD>Coniston Files Countersuit Against Gillette</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York-based firm seeking control of Gillette
Co. filed a countersuit in federal court Tuesday claiming the
personal care giant misrepresented facts in recent legal action and
material sent to shareholders.
   The countersuit by two Coniston Partners subsidiaries is the
latest in a series of exchanges in the courts and in newspapers
over Coniston's attempt to oust four Gillette directors at
Thursday's annual meeting in Andover.
   The Coniston suit alleges Gillette presented misleading and
false statements in material sent to its nearly 27,000 shareholders
and run in newspapers urging rejection of Coniston's takeover
attempt, said Victor Lewkow, one of Coniston's attorneys.
   Lewkow said Coniston took issue with an indication by Gillette
that Coniston was interested in a ``greenmail'' payment to abandon
its bid. Greenmail is the term used when a company buys back its
stock from a potential suitor at a premium above the market price.
   Lewkow said the countersuit by RB Associates of New Jersey and
Bahamas-based RB Partners also seeks dismissal of a Gillette suit
filed last week.
   The action does not try to block the annual meeting, Lewkow
said. He said Coniston could see monetary damages against Gilette.
   On April 14, Gillette filed suit in federal court seeking to
block Coniston from soliciting votes from shareholders. Gillette
claims Coniston violated federal laws by issuing material that did
not fully outline all partners and investors affiliated with the
takeover attempt.
   On Tuesday, Judge Rya Zobel ordered an April 29 hearing for both
suits.
   Coniston's slate of director candidates includes the three
Coniston principals and David Strassler, who was also named as a
defendant in the Gillette suit. Shareholders can vote in person or
by proxy ballot.
   Coniston's bid received a boost Monday when the California
Public Employees Retirement Fund, the fifth-largest Gillette
shareholder with about 1.5 million shares, announced it will vote
for the Coniston candidates.
   Results of the voting are not expected for at least a week
following the meeting. Gillette said its suit should not delay the
meeting.
   The two Coniston partnerships have accumulated 6.76 million
Gillette shares, or about 5.8 percent of the company's shares
outstanding.
   In several letters to shareholders since March, Gillette
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Colman Mockler Jr. claimed
Coniston plans to sell or dismember the Boston-based company.
   Coniston states it can boost company profitability and stock
prices at Gillette, which paid nearly $580 million in late 1986 to
halt Revlon Group Inc.'s repeated takeover attempts.
   Gillette laid off nearly 2,400 workers and sold several
unprofitable divisions during restructuring after Revlon signed a
10-year agreement not to seek control of the company.

<HEAD>House Votes Ban On Telephone Pornography Services</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: New throughout with compromise plan killed, Senate action
likely Wednesday, education bill passed.
^By STEVEN KOMAROW</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday approved a nationwide ban
on ``dial-a-porn'' telephone pornography services despite arguments
that the bill was unconstitutional.
   The legislation, identical to an amendment approved earlier in
the Senate, was included in an $8.3 billion education bill passed
397 to 1 after lawmakers handed Democratic leaders a defeat and
rejected a less-sweeping anti-porn provision.
   Final Senate action on the package was expected Wednesday.
   ``Some may question the constitutionality of this measure,''
said Rep. Ralph Hall, D-Texas. ``But it is the most
straightforward.''
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Committee on
Energy and Commerce, called the measure ``extraordinarily shaky''
on constitutional grounds.
   Barry W. Lynn, legislative counsel of the American Civil
Liberties Union, said the ban ``clearly intrudes on the privacy and
the free-speech rights of adult Americans. This is a hopelessly
inept way of dealing with the issue of children's access to
dial-a-porn, which should be the only matter under consideration.''
   He predicted ``years of litigation, and in the process,
increased access by children to dial-a-porn.'' The situation would
get worse because current Federal Communications Commission rules
protecting children from telephone pornography would be thrown away
in the process, he said.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., first won the dial-a-porn ban
amendment 98-0 when the Senate first passed the otherwise
non-controversial education bill. But the House had included no
similar provision in its version of the bill and a compromise, less
legally controversial provision was approved by House-Senate
conferees.
   While the Helms amendment contained a total ban on the services
for adults as well as children, the education bill's provision
would have had telephone companies block access to dial-a-porn
unless the telephone customer, an adult, specifically requested
they be made available.
   Opponents of the compromise said it was too weak and pointed out
that about 12 percent of the nation's telephone exchanges did not
have the technology to block out the service to some homes but not
to others.
   In an attempt to satisfy both sides, House leaders on Tuesday
orchestrated the vote on a new, separate but otherwise identical
dial-a-porn bill. The plan was to have both versions approved, with
the education bill's language available if the total ban failed to
pass constitutional muster.
   The separate bill passed the House 379-22. But then, in a defeat
for Democratic leaders, the House inserted it into the education
bill in place of the compromise.
   House Republicans carried the day after accusing the Democratic
leaders of trying to block the flat-out ban.
   Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., who sponsored the Helms amendment in
the House, called the Democrats' process ``a charade'' by lawmakers
hoping the ban would be blocked in the Senate.
   He called the limited protections in the education compromise
``akin to telling someone it's illegal to sell someone drugs,
unless someone walks up to them ... and asks for some.''
   Voting against the dial-a-porn ban, when it came up as a
separate bill, were Reps. Anthony Beilenson, D-Calif., Howard
Berman, D-Calif., Douglas Bosco, D-Calif., Ron Dellums, D-Calif.,
Julian Dixon, D-Calif., Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., Don Edwards,
D-Calif., Barney Frank, D-Mass., Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., Bill
Green, R-N.Y., Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., Charles Hayes,
D-Ill., William Lehman, D-Fla., Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., Peter
Rodino, D-N.J., Edward Roybal, D-Calif., Pete Stark, D-Calif.,
Gerry Studds, D-Mass., Henry Waxman, D-Calif., Ted Weiss, D-N.Y.,
Alan Wheat, D-Mo., and Sidney Yates, D-Ill.
   Rep. Donald Pease, D-Ohio, voted ``present.''
   Not voting were Reps. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., Doug Barnard,
D-Ga., Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., Beau Boulter, R-Texas, William Clay,
D-Mo., William Clinger, R-Pa., George Crockett, D-Mich., Hal Daub,

Richard Ray, D-Ga., Gus Savage, D-Ill., Norman Sisisky, D-Va., and
Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y.

the dial-a-porn language was Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill.

<HEAD>Safety Inspectors Say They Were Told To `Generate Numbers'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to expand on Bush's role and include reaction
from his office. Edits to tighten.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety inspectors told a Senate
committee Tuesday they were instructed last September to ``generate
numbers'' through sham inspections emphasizing quantity over
improving the quality of the nation's workplaces.
   ``Because the office was short on numbers for the year, they
wanted compliance officers to generate double the number of OSHA 1
(inspection) reports,'' Dr. John Barry, an industrial hygienist in
the agency's Philadelphia regional office, testified Tuesday.
   Barry and other field inspectors stationed in Texas described in
the second day of hearings by the Senate Labor Committee how the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration boosted its
inspection totals last year by more than 2,000.
   The committee, chaired by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., has
been preparing the hearings for more than a year. None of the seven
Republicans on the panel have attended the first two days.
   Before the first witness was called Monday, Kennedy vowed to
``show that the decision to let workers die ... has been supervised
and carried out by the highest levels of this administration.''
   Assistant Labor Secretary Michael Baroody and OSHA Administrator
John Pendergrass are scheduled to testify before the panel on
Wednesday.
   ``I'm sure we'll be able to set the record straight then,''
Terry Mikelson, an OSHA spokesman, said Tuesday when asked for the
agency's response to allegations raised so far in the hearings.
   Two senior OSHA officials testified Tuesday that, because of
intervention by Vice President George Bush last month, they are now
rewriting regulations to enable some companies to avoid the expense
of venting toxic gases from some workplaces by instead making
workers wear less effective personal respirators.
   Career bureaucrats in OSHA believed they had won a seven-year
fight with the White House Office of Management and Budget over the
respirator proposal until Bush met on March 22 with OMB officials
and Baroody.
   As a result of that meeting, proposed standards are being
prepared for White House approval that would allow greater use of
personal respirators for short-term exposure to toxic substances or
when the cost of engineered ventilation controls are considered
``excessive,'' the committee was told.
   The current regulations, in effect since 1981, establish a
hierarchy of preferred methods for protecting workers from toxic
gases. At the top of that hierarchy are the often-expensive
ventilation systems.
   If ventilation is impractical, employers can alter their work
practices such as rotating workers in and out of hazardous areas.
At the bottom of the current heirarchy are personal respirators.
   The Task Force on Regulatory Relief chaired by Bush in 1981
recommended altering that hierarchy to recognize ``technical
improvements in respirators as opposed to the blanket regulation of
ventilation systems everywhere,'' said Steve Hart, Bush's press
secretary.
   ``There is no way in my view that respirators can be as
protective,'' Sheldon Weiner, deputy director of health standards
for OSHA, told the committee Tuesday, acknowledging that White
House calls for new regulations were met with stiff resistence.
   ``It's a waste of our time as far as I'm concerned,'' added John
Martonik, an official in OSHA's health standards office.
Nonetheless, Martonik testified Tuesday, ``We have finished
redrafting it for submittal to OMB for review.''
   Weiner and Martonik said the respirator issue was revived as a
direct result of Bush's meeting with Baroody.
   After the meeting, Baroody wrote a memorandum to Pendergrass
about the 48 months of delay on the respirator issue and similar
delays on three other changes that had been recommended by Bush's
task force.
   ``OMB was critical of the Department of Labor for failing to
meet its commitments and deadlines,'' Baroody said in the March 28
memo. ``The vice president affirmed this and expressed his personal
interest and concern in completing the regulatory agenda
established by the task force.''
   Hart, Bush's spokesman, described the meeting as a broad review
of each agency's success or failure in carrying out the task
force's recommendations.
   ``The vice president didn't set his sights on this particular
regulatory item but on the entire unfilled agenda,'' Hart said.
``In the spirit of let's get going on these items, he said we need
to make this part of our agenda for the remainder of the year.''
   Kennedy, meanwhile, repeated his charges Tuesday, saying that
career OSHA employees were instructed by Reagan administration
officials ``to generate misleading data that give the appearance of
zeal as a cover for neglect.''
   ``We're going to have a new administration after this fall and,
hopefully, we can get this agency back on track again,'' he said
after Tuesday's hearing.
   Michelle Vallon, an industrial hygienist in OSHA's Irving,
Texas, office, told the committee Tuesday that she produced 25 OSHA
inspection reports from a three-day visit to a construction site
last September.
   Ms. Vallon said she believes she was told by supervisors to
inspect the site because of a large number of subcontractors on the
job and her office was nearing the end of the fiscal year and had
not met its quota of inspections.
   ``They didn't exactly say it, but I drew that conclusion,'' she
said in response to a question from Kennedy. ``We were under
constant pressure to get numbers.''
   In response to another question from Kennedy, Ms. Vallon agreed
with his assertion that the inspection program ``essentially was a
sham.''
   OSHA records show that the number of its inspections rose from
59,452 in fiscal 1986 to 61,466 last year but were still 3 percent
below what they were in 1980, the last year of President Carter's
administration.
   Inspections of manufacturing plants also have declined by 45
percent in the past seven years but inspections of construction
sites have increased by 35 percent over the same time to 35,495
last year.
   OSHA officials have repeatedly defended that record as switching
the agency's resources to where the greatest hazards exist _
construction.
   Unions, however, have maintained that the policy also has
allowed the agency to ``inflate'' its enforcement activity by
counting each subcontractor on the site as a separate inspection.
   ``Most sites average seven to eight contractors, meaning that in
reality only 4,500 to 5,000 construction sites were visited,''
United Steelworkers President Lynn Williams told the committee
earlier.

   President Reagan on Tuesday took issue with
critics of administration space plans and asked Congress and the
American people to ``join me in making the long-term investment
required to advance U.S. leadership in space.''
   ``Can we afford to stop our exploration and wait for others to
pass us?'' Reagan asked in a speech at the annual
government-industry dinner of the Electronic Industries Association.
   ``The space station is vital to our leadership in space and
contributes to our pre-eminence in manned space flight,'' the
president said. ``Some say we can't afford the space station.''
   But, he asked, ``can we afford to jettison the next generation
of technical spin-offs?''
   ``Tonight I ask Congress and all the American people to join me
in making the long-term investment required to advance U.S.
leadership in space,'' Reagan said. ``We must begin that investment
by funding the increases I've proposed for our civil space
program.''
   Reagan also said it was administration policy ``to encourage
private sector investment and involvement in outer space.''
   ``We will help develop a highway to space by using private
launch services to the greatest extent feasible, and we are working
to win legislation to limit liability for commercial launch
providers,'' he said.
   ``It's a future beyond the most distant star in our dreams that
beckons us,'' Reagan told the electronics executives. ``And to
those who say it can't be reached, that it's impossible, I'd just
point toward your industries and ask if a few years ago they
thought what you are doing today would also be impossible.''
   The president also put in a plug for the Strategic Defense
Initiative, or Star Wars, his proposal for a space-based defense
against nuclear missiles.
   ``Five years ago I proposed SDI and, much to my satisfaction, we
have made tremendous progress in that research,'' he said. ``We
must not stop dreaming because a few naysayers insist on limiting
our options for a safe and secure future.''
