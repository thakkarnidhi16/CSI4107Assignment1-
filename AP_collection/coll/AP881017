   A fast-moving storm raked central and northern
Illinois with hail and high winds on Monday, delaying hundreds of
flights at Chicago airports, and forcing the evacuation of two
schools and a factory near Peoria.
   The storm forced delays of 225 jetliners flying into and out of
O'Hare International Airport, the nation's busiest, said Robert
Handschiegel, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration.
   ``The average delay was an hour and 15 minutes and the maximum
was three hours,'' he said.
   Flights also were delayed at Midway airport as a tornado watch
was issued for the Chicago area Monday afternoon. A water spout was
reported on Lake Michigan about 2 p.m., weather service officials
said, but it caused no damage.
   The storm, caused by a collision between a warm front from the
south and a cold front from the north, was headed east, weather
officials said. Illinois was expecting mostly sunny skies Tuesday,
with highs in the 50s and 60s.
   Five people were reported struck by lightning in the Chicago
area, and one, an electrician, remained hospitalized in stable
condition Monday night.
   In Peoria County, the storm unleashed wind gusts up to 63 mph
and golf-ball-sized hail, causing extensive damage to buildings,
homes and several schools Monday morning.
   ``We got no warning, no sirens, no nothing,'' said William
Collier, school superintendent at Dunlap, about six miles northwest
of Peoria. ``It was a freak storm that blew up out of nowhere. I
was sitting here at my window and I saw it get dark.
   ``Within about 15 seconds it was really blowing and there was a
tremendous electrical storm. Car windows were popping out and
exploding, glass was breaking and trees and power lines went down.''
   Youngsters at the five Dunlap school buildings were unscathed,
although the 500 high school students were ushered outside and
classes canceled when officials smelled smoke and feared a fire.
Officials found roof damage but no fire.
   The Mossville Grade School, about 15 miles east of Dunlap, also
was closed because of roof damage.
   Assembly lines were shut down for about 30 minutes and employees
were evacuated from shops at Caterpillar Inc.'s Mossville engine
plant in a complex that employs about 5,000 people, said Gil Nolde,
company spokesman.

   At least 17 people drowned when a

people were killed in a similar sinking in the central Philippines,
the Philippine Constabulary reported today.
   A belated report said five other people were missing from the
Lady Aurea, a motorized outrigger which capsized as it was buffeted
by big waves Friday off Aurora province, 120 miles northeast of
Manila. It said 11 others were rescued.
   The report gave no other details.
   At least 55 people drowned and 77 others were rescued when an
overloaded ferry boat sank during a squall Friday as it was sailing
from Samar to Leyte island in the central Philippines, the Coast
Guard reported last Saturday.

<HEAD>Italy Asks Widow of Nazi Criminal to Stay Away</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds 4 grafs on senators asking about government action,
possible legal penalties</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's justice minister on Monday urged the widow
of a Nazi war criminal not to come to Italy to promote a book on
how she helped her husband escape from a Rome military prison in
1977.
   Giuliano Vassalli said that such a visit solely for publicity
``is the cause of legitimate concern'' by relatives of those killed
in a massacre for which Herbert Kappler was judged responsibile.
   Kappler, an SS colonel in Rome during World War II, was
sentenced to life in prison for his role in the massacre of 335
Italians in 1944.
   He escaped in August 1977, reportedly concealed in a large
suitcase wheeled out of the prison by his wife. Kappler died of
cancer a year later in West Germany.
   His widow, Annelise, said last week she would come to Rome
Saturday to present her book ``I Will Bring You Home.''
   A Justice Ministry spokesman said Vassalli issued a statement in
response to a letter he received from Mrs. Kappler in which she
stated why she planned to come to Italy and asked his opinion.
   Three senators representing Italy's largest political parties,
the Christian Democrats, Communists and Socialists, asked the
government Monday to declare what measures it would take to keep
Mrs. Kappler out of the country.
   But the government did not say immediately if it might take
legal action.
   Law provides a prison term of up to 10 years for aiding the
escape of a convict sentenced to life.

<HEAD>Jet Tried For Seldom-Used, Less Equipped Runway, Union Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Uganda Airlines jet that crashed near Rome's
main airport killing 31 people was aiming for a seldom-used runway
that lacks sophisticated landing equipment, an Italian union
official said.
   The choice of the runway meant that the pilot had to calculate
how to land the Boeing 707 at the fog-shrouded airport, instead of
having electronic equipment guide him, said Andrea Gariup,
president of the main Italian pilots' union.
   The red, yellow and white jet plowed through three houses and a
rental-car parking lot before coming to rest in a field and
bursting into flames early Monday. Thirty-one people were killed,
including six of the seven crew members; 21 were injured.
   Most of those on board Flight QU775 were Ugandans traveling from
London to Uganda's Entebbe Airport via Leonardo da Vinci Airport.
Two Nigerians were listed among the injured, while the British
Embassy in Rome said seven or eight passengers were Britons.
   The airport said it did not yet have a complete list of
passenger identities.
   Gariup said the pilot apparently chose runway ``34 Left''
because visibility was slightly better there than on two other
runways he had previously approached.
   However, the strip lacked the Instrument Landing System
installed at other runways to provide information to pilots about
their altitude, said Gariup, head of the National Association of
Commercial Airline Pilots.
   The pilot therefore had to target his descent using information
from the control tower and his view of the runway, Gariup said.
   The pilot ``had to calculate every minute, based on the distance
to the airport, how he had to approach,'' Gariup said in a
telephone interview Monday night with The Associated Press. ``With
the other system, the instruments would tell him if he was too
low.''
   ``Perhaps he miscalculated or perhaps he saw something else that
he thought was the runway.''
   There was no answer at the airport director's office or the
press office Monday evening, but an air traffic controller in the
flight tower confirmed that the runway was not frequently used and
lacked the landing equipment other strips had. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Government and airport authorities emphasized that they had not
yet established the cause of the crash. The Italian government
announced Monday evening that a nine-man commission would
investigate, in addition to a judicial board.
   The commander of the Rome province's fire department, Guido
Chiucini, who helped coordinate the rescue, speculated in a
telephone interview that there was a ``misunderstanding'' between
the control tower and the pilot since the plane approached at such
a low altitude.
   However, the air traffic controllers' union denied there had
been any misunderstanding. Other officials noted there had not yet
been an examination of the ``black box,'' which records flight
information data, or the recordings of the pilot's conversations
with the tower.
   Among those who survived were a British dairy farmer and his
26-year-old wife who leaped from the burning aircraft clutching
their 8-month-old son.
   ``We jumped out of a hole in the fuselage behind us,'' Geoffrey
Gait, 31, told The Associated Press in an interview at Sant'Eugenio
Hospital. ``Ruth jumped backward, holding (baby Richard) to her
chest, and then fell about six feet to the ground. I picked them
up. We walked about 200 yards and then some Ugandans came out.''
   The Gaits, who suffered minor burns, were on their way to the
African nation to work with a charity project that provides farmers
with cows.
   Chunks of the aircraft and passengers' clothing covered a wide
swath in the plane's wake. Long after the crash, hundreds of sheets
of blue-lined paper stamped ``Uganda National Examination Board''
still blanketed the ground.

<TEXT>
   Shimon Peres kissed a girl with flowers
and shook hands with robe-clad notables, but once the organized
hoopla was over, the reception in this Arab town for the Labor
Party leader turned frosty.
   Polls show the left-of-center Labor Party might lose half its
Arab support, partly because Labor's No. 2 man, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, is held responsible for the harsh crackdown on the
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Labor and the right-wing Likud bloc headed by Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir are running neck-to-neck and a drop in Arab support
for Labor could hand the Nov. 1 election to Likud.
   ``Are you going to vote for us?'' a shirt-sleaved Peres,
surrounded by a dozen security men, asked a resident Monday during
a walking tour of Shfaram, a northern Israeli town of 26,000.
   The man did not answer, and instead told Peres the town needed
better roads. Responded Peres: ``If we get enough votes, we'll get
the Finance Ministry, and then we can do it.''
   In an attempt at conviviality, Peres greeted a woman with the
Arabic phrase ``sabah ilher,'' but after being told he had said
``good morning'' instead of the intended ``good evening,'' Peres
stuck to Hebrew.
   Most Shfaram residents stayed indoors or watched from their
balconies as Peres and a few dozen party activists walked through
the town which in 1984 gave half its votes to the Communist Party.
   During a reception at the home of local Labor Party leader
Khalil Mishal, Peres was handed flowers by Mishal's daughter who
wore a Hebrew sticker reading ``I'm also for Labor.''
   Mishal had invited about 150 Arab notables who shook hands with
Peres and provided the backdrop for brief welcoming speeches.
   At a later rally, Peres urged Israeli Arabs not to ``waste''
their votes on the communists or the Progressive List for Peace.
Both are pro-PLO and unacceptable to Labor as coalition partners.
   ``If this time, there is no peace, it will be the fault of the
Israeli Arabs. If you waste your votes, nothing is going to
happen,'' Peres told about 500 people who listened in silence and
applauded briefly and politely at the end.
   About 330,000 of Israel's 800,000 Arab citizens are eligible to
vote this year, and could control 14 seats in the 120-member
Parliament. In 1984, one in four Arabs voted Labor, giving the
party the three seats that provided its 44-41 advantage over Likud.
   But this year, support for Labor is slipping, mainly because of
growing Israeli Arab identification with the 10-month-old uprising
that has claimed at least 299 Palestinian and six Israeli lives.
Analysts say Labor could lose 1.5 seats in the Arab sector.
   ``Many people don't want to vote for Labor because of what Rabin
is doing in the occupied territories,'' said a 37-year-old
carpenter in the Arab town of Nazareth near Shfaram. The man, who
said he supported Labor in 1984, spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Asked whether Rabin was a liability for Labor's Arab campaign,
Peres was evasive. ``I think they (Arab voters) must understand the
situation as it is, and I hope they will change their minds,'' he
told The Associated Press in Shfaram.
   But Communist Party activists in Shfaram were optimistic that
the revolt against Israeli occupation would boost their chances.
   ``We'll get more votes because of the uprising,'' said local
party leader Sagir Moussa, 39, as he and other activists handed out
leaflets saying ``Yes to a Palestinian state'' and ``Long live the
uprising.''
   His party might gain one seat this year, bringing its total to
five, according to recent polls Labor has conducted among Arab
voters. The polls were cited by the Jerusalem Post newsaper.
   According to the polls, the Progressive List for Peace would
maintain its strength with two seats, while Labor would win 1.5
seats. Six other parties, including the Likud, would share the
remaining four seats, an unidentified Labor official told the
newspaper Monday.
   A 26-year-old Shfaram resident, who would only give his first
name, Ahmed, said he was not convinced by Peres' speech. He also
criticized Peres for promising true equality, better schools and
more jobs for Israeli Arabs if Labor is elected.
   ``Every four years they discover that we exist,'' said Ahmed, a
hairdresser. ``They make promises, but nothing changes.''

   George Bush on Monday accused Democrat
Michael Dukakis of a ``total lack of understanding of our
military'' and called the Nov. 8 election a referendum on military
policy.
   The vice president used a Martin-Marietta defense plant, where
``Star Wars'' research is being conducted, to launch his latest
attack on Dukakis.
   ``I will not leave America defenseless against ballistic
missiles,'' Bush told about 2,500 company employees in the
cavernous assembly plant where Titan IV rockets are built.
   The vice president made the comments before flying to Chicago,
where he addressed a Jewish group at the Holocaust Memorial in
Skokie, Ill. Bush told his audience that ``the relationship between
Israel and the United States has never been better, never been
stronger.''
   At the Martin-Marietta plant, in the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains, Bush ridiculed Dukakis for opposing continued ballistic
missile flight testing.
   ``We need to modernize. We need to test. And we can't defend
America with blueprints,'' Bush said.
   And he scoffed at the Democrat's position on the Reagan
administration's Strategic Defense Initiative, or ``Star Wars,''
program.
   Dukakis has been highly critical of the proposed system _
designed to destroy incoming Soviet missiles in space _ but has
also said during the campaign that he might support some continued
research.
   Noting that Dukakis had once called the program a fantasy, Bush
asked: ``Why spend a dime, if you think it's a fantasy?''
   Attacking Dukakis for his opposition to new missile systems and
for his emphasis on stronger conventional forces has been a main
Bush campaign theme.
   Bush was planning to introduce that theme in an ad using footage
of Dukakis riding around in a tank during a campaign visit to
Michigan, said campaign spokeswoman Sheila Tate.
   Although Ms. Tate had no information on a Washington Post report
Tuesay that the campaign was tentatively planning to spend more
than $15 million of its $30 million-plus advertising in three
states, she said three new ads were being aired Tuesday, and a new
ad was being shot then. The three states are California, New Jersey
and Ohio, the Post said.
   Bush declared on Monday that with the next century approaching,
``it is all that more important for us to understand the role that
our defense has played in securing the peace, the role our military
forces must continue to play if America's future is also to be
secure.
   ``And this election is a referendum about that role.''
   At Skokie, Bush stood in a violent thunderstorm at an outdoor
rally for the dedication, where he said: ``I am committed to the
survival of Israel. Israel has survived, will survive, has
flourished, will flourish.''
   Bush talked about the importance of maintaining the ``strategic
relationship'' with Israel and joked: ``I wish that the Lord had
given us a little bit of a different weather condition. He works in
strange and mysterious ways.''
   Bush did not mention the controversial effort by the American
Nazi Party to hold a march in Skokie in 1978 in which the Nazis
were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union. The Nazis
decided at the last minute to hold their march in neighboring
Chicago.
   Bush has frequently criticized Dukakis for his membership in the
ACLU. Aides said the visit should be viewed reinforcement of Bush's
criticism.
   With polls showing the vice president pulling ahead of Dukakis _
including an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll Monday showing Bush ahead
55-38 _ Republican strategists say Bush will focus on a few
proven-effective themes such as defense in the remaining three
weeks before the election.
   Bush donned a bright blue work jacket as he toured the
Martin-Marietta plant, accompanied by James R. Schlesinger, who has
served in Cabinet jobs in both Democratic and Republican
administrations.
   The vice president was shown a simulator for a laser weapon
system to be based on an orbiting space station called ``Rapid
Retargeting, Precision Pointing,'' or by its facetious code name,
``R2P2.''
   Bush was told by Martin-Marietta vice president Morris H.
Thorson that the device was so accurate that it could hit a
basketball on top of the Empire State Building in New York from
Pike's Peak in Colorado.
   Schlesinger, defense secretary and CIA director for President
Ford and energy secretary for President Carter, told the plant
employees that ``the presidency is no place for on-the-job
training.''
   Bush said that the Massachusetts governor's refusal to back new
nuclear systems and his willingness to cut two aircraft carriers
``indicates his total lack of understanding of our military.''
   ``Governor, it's time to stop running down our defenses,'' Bush
said.
   Meanwhile, Bush said he favors a ``possible mix'' for a new
generation of mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles between
the Midgetman missile and a rail-based MX missile system _ but not
full deployment of both.
   Dennis Ross, Bush's foreign policy adviser, said going ahead
with both weapons systems would cost some $60 billion, and that
Bush wanted to keep the costs of the program to about half that.

   A racial slur uttered in frustration nearly
ended Lois Bostic's 27-year career in education. Then her black
students stepped in, taught their elders a lesson in tolerance, and
saved Mrs. Bostic's job.
   ``We were ready to forgive and go on,'' said senior Angela
Matthews, 17, one of six students who initiated, typed and
distributed petitions in support of the white librarian. ``Anybody
ought to get a second chance.''
   After the slur was reported last month, parents in this farming
town 80 miles southeast of Little Rock circulated petitions calling
for Mrs. Bostic's ouster, and she told school officials she would
quit. The board promptly endorsed her decision.
   But then, high school students mounted their own petition drive,
the school board rescinded its resolution, and Mrs. Bostic is here
to stay.
   Mrs. Bostic, who is in her first year here teaching both
elementary and high school students, said her troubles began Sept.
27 as she taught her seventh class of the day on using the library
at Gould Elementary.
   As she recalls it, the 20 sixth-graders in the class weren't
paying attention and were growing increasingly rowdy. In an effort
to settle them down, she told the students, all of them black: ``I
think you're trying to make me think you're a bunch of poor, dumb
niggers, and I don't think that.''
   Mrs. Bostic, 50, said she immediately realized the
inappropriateness of the word.
   ``I opened my mouth and put my foot in it,'' she said in an
interview. ``In our part of the country, we call each other hicks
and hillbillies and that's OK. But if somebody from California
moves in and they refer to us as hillbillies, we get angry. And I
realized that it was wrong.
   ``I was at my rope's end. I was just trying to get these kids to
behave. I wasn't even conscious that I was using a word that would
offend them,'' she said.
   Children told their parents about the remarks, and parents went
to the school board in this town of 1,670 people, about 60 percent
of them black.
   On Oct. 3, a petition calling for Mrs. Bostic's dismissal was
presented to the board. Many of the 91 parents who circulated and
signed it say they remembered routine discrimination and hateful
use of the word in their youth. The parents' petition alleged other
insulting racial remarks had been made by Mrs. Bostic. She denied
that and said her only use of the slur was before the
sixth-graders. It was, she told the board, ``a dumb, stupid
mistake.''
   Mrs. Bostic recalls that she didn't encounter many blacks while
growing up in southern Missouri. ``That word I used is not part of
my vocabulary. My mother would have slapped me across the mouth if
I'd said that when I was growing up,'' she said.
   Overhearing the word in conversations between black students,
usually in a humorous context, Mrs. Bostic concluded she could
relate to them better if she used it. ``I had no prejudices. I was
going to be one of them and went so far as using a word I should
not have used, that I didn't realize would offend them,'' she said.
   Repentant and tearful, the librarian announced she would quit by
the end of that week. The school board endorsed her exit, saying
she had lost effectiveness.
   Mrs. Bostic was preparing to move out of town with her retiree
husband, her career ended, less than three months after she moved
to Arkansas.
   On the day before her self-imposed departure deadline, she
learned that pupils were circulating petitions asking the board to
reconsider. They bore signatures from 124 of the town's 147 high
school students, only two of whom are white.
   Surprised, board members reopened their discussion and reversed
the request for Mrs. Bostic's resignation. ``It's their school.
They're the ones that have to be with her every day,'' said school
board president Alan Minor, who is black.
   ``We figured this: Why would this woman move to this town with
more blacks than whites if she's a bigot? She just made a bad
mistake and we decided she deserved a second chance,'' said senior
class president Roy Rainey III, 17.
   Mrs. Bostic said Rainey, a lanky basketball center, ``is my hero
right now. He came to my defense. It was my miracle.''
   Home economics teacher Doris Rucker, one of five blacks on the
13-person high school faculty, praised the students. ``I'm so proud
of them. They showed us the way,'' she said.
   ``I'm encouraged about the future of our little town,'' said
Mayor Dave Rochelle, who is white. ``This petition indicates we
have 124 young citizens who are good people.''

   The Kentucky chapter of the National
Organization for Women has elected Jim Newlin its president, making
him the second man in the nation to lead a NOW chapter.
   Newlin, who was elected Saturday and lives in nearby Henryville,
Ind., said he joined NOW because ``their cause covers just about
everybody else's causes _ equal rights for everyone, man, woman and
child.''
   He said he was the only man among 19 women when he attended his
first NOW meeting, in 1985.
   Although the members included him in its work immediately, he
said, ``they thought I was a spy. I felt I had to earn my stripes.
Within two months, I had brought in 10 new members.''
   Former Kentucky NOW President Jean Varble said there may be ``a
few members who may not be comfortable with the idea'' of a male
president, but ``We can't cut off half the population.''
   Only the chapter in Washington, D.C., has had a male president.

<TEXT>
   Wildfires Sunday threatened centuries-old
giant sequoia trees in the state's mid-section and crackled toward
homes along the mountain ridges surrounding Los Angeles.
   The fires erupted during another California fall heat wave with
temperatures nudging 100 degrees in many areas and Santa Ana winds,
dried and heated by inland deserts, reaching 30 mph.
   More than 3,500 acres were blackened in the fires, several of
them man-caused, authorities said. A wind-pushed 2,000-acre blaze
in the Angeles National Forest endangered homes in the path of the
flames 30 miles north of Los Angeles.
   The fire's huge brown smoke plume, rising 7,000 feet skyward,
could be seen 50 miles away at Los Angeles International Airport.
   Mountain residents of the northeast San Fernando Valley were put
on alert but no evacuations were ordered. About 200 firefighters
were battling the blaze and hundreds more were on the way late in
the afternoon.
   ``This one is giving us real problems,'' said U.S. Forest
Service spokesman Bruce Bundick. ``It's going in about three
different directions faster than we can corral it.''
   About 160 miles northwest, firefighters battling a 600-acre fire
in Sequoia National Park were optimistic a buffer zone cleared in a
previous controlled burn would save the magnificent trees in the
3-square-mile Giant Forest, said park spokesman Bill Tweed.
   The ancient trees are considered the largest living things on
Earth.
   ``These are certainly one of the biological wonders of the
world,'' Tweed said. ``The fire will inevitably reach the edge of
the Giant Forest. We think that because of the steps taken, we can
prevent it from going into the forest.''
   About 100 campers fled the flames, which started at 8 a.m. in
Potwisha Camp Ground about 30 miles northeast of Visalia. A
careless camper or angler was the suspected cause of the blaze,
Tweed said.
   Another fire 85 miles southeast of Los Angeles in Riverside
County charred 800 acres near Hemet, but firefighters were gaining
the upper hand and containment was anticipated by dawn Monday, said
Joanne Evans, a spokeswoman for the California Department of
Forestry.
   Two smaller fires erupted in the mountainous eastern portion of
the Angeles National Forest. One, started by children playing with
matches and a cigarette lighter, destroyed a house.

   A man driving a stolen car led police in four
cruisers and two helicopters on a chase he ended at the jail
parking lot, authorities said.
   The end of early Sunday's chase came after the driver put the
car into reverse and rammed a police car near the downtown jail,
said police Lt. Carl Wilhite.
   ``He mentioned the fact he had been booked by LAPD officer
before and he knew where to go,'' Wilhite said. ``It was convenient
of him, huh?''
   Frankie Hill, 32, of Los Angeles was booked for assault with a
deadly weapon on a police officer and held on $8,000 bail, Wilhite
said.
   The 15-minute chase began when officers noticed the car Hill was
driving had been stolen, Wilhite said.

   Reuben Feinberg says he has a good reason for
giving $17 million to doctors at Northwestern University Medical
School _ they saved his life.
   Feinberg's gift, the third largest ever received by the
university, was announced Saturday, one year after his heart
surgery at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.
   ``I never had thought about giving money to a hospital before
then,'' said Feinberg, 70, president and director of the Jefferson
State Bank in Chicago.
   ``I was thinking more about a building or something,'' he said.
``But bricks don't accomplish much. People can.''
   Feinberg, whose father, Joseph, died of heart disease, is
donating the money to establish a cardiovascular research center at
the medical school.
   University president Arnold R. Weber said the planned Feinberg
Cardiovascular Research Institute ``has the promise to become the
finest center of excellence in cardiovascular research and
education in the nation.''

<TEXT>
   President John F. Kennedy, Harvard class
of 1940, couldn't resist some good-natured teasing when Yale
awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1962.
   ``As General de Gaulle occasionally acknowledged America to be
the daughter of Europe, so I am pleased to come to Yale, the
daughter of Harvard,'' Kennedy told graduates assembled in the
courtyard of Yale's Old Campus on that sunny June day.
   ``It might be said now that I have the best of both worlds _ a
Harvard education and a Yale degree,'' Kennedy said.
   This year's presidential campaign has elevated what is perhaps
the oldest, most intense and most snobbish rivalry in America to a
new height.
   For the spoils of this contest will go either to a Yale man or a
Harvard man _ only the second time in 200 years that graduates of
the two schools have vied for the presidency of the United States.
   And the only other time it happened, in 1912, the Harvard man,
Theodore Roosevelt, and the Yale man, William Howard Taft, both
lost to a Princeton man, Woodrow Wilson.
   While Kennedy was a master at exploiting his Harvard education
for political advantage, Republican George Bush, Yale class of
1948, has tried to turn Democrat Michael S. Dukakis' Harvard
connections into a campaign liability.
   Bush, scion of a wealthy Greenwich, Conn., family, accuses the
Massachusetts governor, the son of Greek immigrants, of having a
``Harvard boutique'' mentality tainted by ``liberalism and
elitism.''
   Campaigning Saturday in Modesto, Calif., Bush said, ``I don't
want somebody from Harvard telling me what I can do and what I
can't do.''
   Asked about that statement at a news conference Sunday, Bush
said he did not want to take on the institution itself, asking
``How can I, a nice guy from Yale, feel that way about Harvard? Now
come on.
   ``I'm talking about a handful of people that have served in
(recent) Democratic administrations that come out of the same
liberal philisophy. And they know who they are,'' he said.
``There's an elite inside the elite there.''
   Dukakis, in turn, has tried to stay out of the Harvard-Yale
debate, saying his 1960 Harvard law degree and teaching stint at
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government don't make him a Harvard man
at all.
   ``I'm a Swarthmore guy,'' Dukakis says, referring to the liberal
arts college in Pennsylvania where he received his undergraduate
degree.
   But Bush's Harvard line held little sting given his own Ivy
League connections. And it probably was lost on most Americans, who
view both Yale and Harvard as elite Eastern universities for the
wealthy.
   Dukakis campaign aides couldn't hold their tongues when outgoing
Education Secretary William Bennett, himself a Harvard Law School
graduate, asserted on national television in September that the
Harvard crowd ``with which Mike Dukakis runs ... think they're
smarter'' than most Americans.
   ``Bill Bennett spent seven or eight years getting an education
in Massachussetts and these comments are a clear indication that it
didn't do him a bit of good,'' shot back Mark Gearan, press
secretary at Dukakis' Boston headquarters.
   Harvard and Yale have eyed each other with haughty disdain for
nearly 300 years, since Yale was founded in 1701 by a group of
clergy worried about religious backsliding at the more liberal
Harvard, the oldest college in America. Harvard was founded in
1636, just 16 years after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock.
   ``We have been natural rivals almost from the beginning,''
George Pierson, the Larned professor emeritus of history at Yale,
said recently. ``We were the only two with the exception of William
and Mary that you could go to. After that, we both grew in the
favor of the Lord.''
   The Harvard-Yale annual crew race is the oldest intercollegiate
sports rivalry in America, dating from 1852. The schools refer to
their annual football contest as ``The Game,'' as if all others
hardly matter.
   Other Harvard-Yale presidential campaigns have been averted only
by quirks of history. The 1824 election would have pitted Harvard
graduate John Quincy Adams against Yale graduate John Calhoun, but
Calhoun dropped out and threw his support to Adams, who defeated
Andrew Jackson, who didn't have a college degree.
   The 1876 contest between Rutherford B. Hayes, a graduate of
Harvard Law School, against Samuel Tilden would have been a
Harvard-Yale matchup, except Tilden dropped out of Yale after one
year and graduated from New York University.
   Although this is only the second head-to-head match, Harvard and
Yale both boast presidents among their graduates. While Yale holds
the edge in their football series, 56-40, and Harvard holds the
edge in crew races, 72-51, Harvard holds a substantial lead in the
presidential sweepstakes: six Harvard graduates have held the
office _ John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Hayes, Theodore Roosevelt,
Franklin Roosevelt and Kennedy _ compared to just two from Yale _
Taft and Gerald Ford, a 1941 graduate of Yale Law School.
   Raymond Wolfinger, a political scientist at the University of
California at Berkeley, says most Americans don't give a hoot about
the Harvard-Yale rivalry.
   ``In terms of the mass public, the difference between Harvard
and Yale is nonsense,'' said Wolfinger, who earned his doctorate at
Yale.

<HEAD>Few Issues Distinguishing Licht, Chafee In Race For Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Sen. John H. Chafee admits
some people may find it ironic that Richard A. Licht is challenging
him in his run for a third Senate term.
   The Democratic Licht, Rhode Island's lieutenant governor, was 20
years old when his uncle, Frank Licht, defeated Chafee in his 1968
bid for a third term as governor.
   And Licht, who hasn't lost an election in his 13 years as a
politician, said he has no intention of starting now.
   But Chafee, 64, who narrowly won a second Senate term in 1982
against former Attorney General Julius C. Michaelson with 51
percent of the vote, said he feels confident as the Nov. 8 election
approaches.
   ``You can never be totally sure as a candidate, but you can tell
some things and certainly I think the people appreciate what I've
done for them over the years,'' Chafee said recently.
   Chafee, the first Rhode Island Republican to be elected to the
Senate, is considered a moderate, and there are few substantial
issues separating the two men.
   Earlier this year, Chafee announced support for a national
parental leave bill, a measure backed by Licht in the Rhode Island
General Assembly.
   Both of the candidates also support open space preservation.
Chafee, who has been endorsed by four major national environmental
organizations, said he would work to initiate a $10 billion federal
open space program if re-elected.
   Licht sponsored several bills last year that led to the state's
$65 million open-space bond issue. Chafee has charged that the idea
was first his.
   As the election draws near, the candidates have turned to
attacks and the resulting barrage of television commercials has
pushed their campaign spending to nearly $2.5 million each.
   Chafee ran a television ad asserting that when Licht represented
the East Side of Providence in the state Senate from 1975 to 1984,
``He missed one out of every three votes.''
   ``Did he not care? Was he afraid to take a stand?'' the ad asks.
``Or was he too busy doing something else?''
   Licht in turn ran two ads that said he has had a 90 percent
attendance record in the past six years. He said he missed a number
of votes in the early 1980s because of his father's fatal illness
and his own role in a lawsuit that overturned a controversial 1982
redistricting plan.
   Another Licht ad attacked Chafee for his voting record on issues
concerning senior citizens _ a familiar Democratic tactic
nationwide.
   ``Chafee voted 12 times to cut Social Security and five times to
cut Medicare,'' said Licht, who has been endorsed by the National
Council of Senior Citizens.
   Polls continue to show Chafee in the lead, although Licht has
narrowed the gap slightly. A poll taken in September gave Chafee a
lead of 30 percentage points over the Democrat with 59 percent of
the vote. A poll taken in early October, with the same 5 percentage
point margin of error, showed Chafee with 54 percent of the vote,
while Licht was the choice of 33 percent of the 400 people surveyed.

   In the modern age of presidential politics,
the Democrats have a lot of experience being given up for dead.
Generally, it's been a realistic enough presentiment, but Michael
Dukakis will surely look for inspiration to several remarkable
party heroes.
   Harry Truman and Hubert Humphrey are the Mr. Octobers of their
era. It was probably Truman foe Thomas Dewey whom Republican
front-runner George Bush was thinking about when he vowed over the
weekend to ``go the extra mile'' this month, and added, ``I'm not
going to mess up.''
   Lloyd Bentsen was using Truman and Kirk Gibson as his weekend
role models.
   ``Our party has a proud tradition of closing from behind,'' said
Dukakis' indefatigable running mate. He told a farmer's market in
St Louis, ``I can't help but remember Harry Truman out there when
the press had written him off.''
   Humphrey came up short, of course, but his 1968 October comeback
was still extraordinary, following as it did a divisive primary
campaign and a calamitous convention. He sought to succeed an
unpopular president _ Lyndon Johnson _ for whom the word albatross
comes to mind.
   But come back he did. After finally staking out some
independence from Johnson, Humphrey put together a high-energy
campaign in October and ended with 42.7 percent of the vote, nearly
scaring Richard Nixon out of his wits. (Nixon ended with 43.4
percent. George Wallace had 13.5 percent).
   Though a sitting president in 1948, Truman didn't win nomination
until well after midnight, at which time convention managers
released a flock of doves to celebrate. The doves, stifled by the
heat, promptly dropped dead on the convention floor, prompting one
party stalwart to reflect, ``Dead pigeons, just like Truman.''
   Except the year didn't end with Truman dead.
   Unpopular and far behind in the polls, Truman invented the
whistlestop, making an average of 10 speeches a day from the back
of a train and sparing the Republicans no ridicule in that blunt,
partisan ``Give `Em Hell'' manner of his. Dewey was no George Bush;
he stayed above the fray. On election day, Truman stood
expectations on their head, winning 49.5 percent of the vote to
Dewey's 45 percent.
   Dukakis enjoys the same mid-October expectations as Truman,
which is to say few outside his immediate family really believe
he'll win. But there are differences between the two men, and one
is half-tempted to look over at the cerebral and aloof Dukakis and
say, ``Governor, you're no Harry Truman.''
   Truman never had to say, ``I think I'm a reasonably likable
guy,'' and if you asked him to name his heroes in American life,
can you imagine Truman responding _ as did Dukakis last Thursday
night _ ``Some of them are in public life, in the Senate and the
Congress, some of my fellow governors ... are real heroes to me.''
   His fellow governors!
   Truman, like Dukakis, was not a commanding figure. Lots of
people looked down upon him, figuratively and literally.
   ``At first the critics referred to my (campaign) tour as a
`one-man circus,' and called it less efficient and less dignified
than the campaign being put on by the Republicans,'' Truman said in
his memoirs, describing his comeback this way:
   ``I simply told the people in my own language that they had
better wake up to the fact that it was their fight. If they did not
get out and help me win this fight, I emphasized, the Republicans
would soon be giving the farmers and the workers the little end of
the stick again.''
   The Dukakis command huddled in Boston and emerged to tell The
Washington Post they would, a la Truman, concentrate on economic
themes in the last-ditch drive for a miracle. They mapped out an
effort to concentrate on 18 states with 272 electoral votes.
   That doesn't leave any margin for error. It takes 270 electoral
votes to win the White House, and common sense says you can't win
every state you contest _ unless you're Ronald Reagan and you're
going to win them all anyway.
   By Sunday, Bentsen had merged his Truman reminisces with a World
Series theme, buoyed by the fact that the underdogs from Los
Angeles had won a first-game victory with the gimpy Gibson's
two-out homer in ninth.
   ``We're going to be like the Dodgers last night,'' he said. ``It
looked like they were down and out and all of a sudden they hit a
home run and won it. And I think we can do that in the next 24
days.''
   Of course this is Bentsen talking, not Dukakis.

   When Dan Quayle's campaign plane was late
taking off one night last week, a reporter suggested a reason for
the delay. Quayle, he said, was up in the cockpit giving an
interview to the pilot.
   ``It's the only person he hasn't talked to yet,'' the reporter
said.
   When the ``new,'' accessible Dan Quayle emerged last week, the
contrast with the ``old,'' aloof Quayle seemed dramatic to those
who had studied him since he became the Republican vice
presidential nominee.
   The old Quayle was a wooden, programmed speaker who avoided the
media at every turn. The new Quayle has a conversational speaking
style and is relentlessly available, engaging protesters and
showing up everywhere there is a camera, microphone or notepad.
   Like a schoolboy given a reprieve from a final exam, Quayle now
seems relaxed, cheerful, confident and, as he put it, ``a lot
happier.''
   The Indiana senator's public break with the rigid control of his
campaign by Bush handlers and declaration that ``I am my own
handler'' raised skeptical eyebrows among his press entourage.
   The change still seems one more of style than substance. Quayle
is still relegated to campaigning mostly in safe Republican areas
or small towns in swing states of his native Midwest. And he
continues to echo positions already propounded by the campaign.
   But after a week of scrutiny, even the most dedicated skeptics
were forced to observe that Quayle did indeed seem to be a changed
candidate.
   Those who have known Quayle for years say his new style typifies
him before he was lifted from relative obscurity to the intense
spotlight of a national political campaign.
   He is quick to challenge protesters who disrupt his speeches,
telling them ``You don't know my record.'' And his speeches are
often delivered from notecards rather than prepared texts. Often,
they are followed by a chatty question-and-answer session with the
audience.
   With close media scrutiny and the fallout from damaging
questions about his military service, academic record and personal
life _ it simply took Quayle time to decide that it was best to
just be himself, aides argue. It is a theory Quayle echoes.
   ``I was just trying to feel my way through this national
campaign and what the ground rules were and the expectations are
and how best I can serve George Bush, and it's just taken me a
while,'' he said. ``Now I know and now I'm off on my own.''
   Quayle tackled his new role with relish. In fact, his enthusiasm
for his self-styled job of ``Dr. Spin'' _ the man who interprets
campaign developments for the press _ was such that a sign was
posted at the entrance of the press section of the plane reading:
``Spin Free Zone.'' But Quayle came back anyway, again and again.
   hose Bush strategists would be wringing their hands, Quayle told
reporters one night as he perched on a the arm of a seat in the
aircraft, ``if they knew I was back here now.''
   Quayle says the moment he knew he had to break away came two
days after his debate with Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, when he learned
of the anonymous sniping from Bush staffers who viewed him as a
liability to the ticket.
   Angry, Quayle telephoned Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker
III. Then he went public, saying he would take more control of his
campaign. Aides denied that the whole episode was Baker's latest
ploy to prop up a weak candidate.
   What appeared more likely was that Baker and company had turned
Quayle's dissatisfaction into a positive development. Campaign
officials in fact seemed delighted at the media attention drawn by
Quayle's metamorphosis into an ``in-charge'' candidate.
   Quayle says that if the strategists ``didn't like what I was
doing, I suppose they could find a way to try to stop me.''
   ``But ... I think what is happening is that they trust my
judgment and my judgment from a political point of view is good,''
he said.
   Quayle denies suggestions of a rift between the two camps.
   ``We're all together. We're all pulling together for George
Bush.''
   The new strategy may be risky. Quayle's campaign to date has
been noteworthy for those few moments when he did strike out on his
own to depart from a prepared text and ended up committing gaffes,
such as the time he told reporters, ``I didn't live in this
century.''
   But Quayle seems philosophical about the dangers.
   ``You're in a critical position no matter how you conduct
yourself and I made a decision on the way I'm going to conduct
myself ... and it's going to be entirely different than I did the
first weeks of the campaign,'' he said.
   ``In some respects you can say that it's a higher wire that
we're walking on, but it will help George Bush and I am convinced
of that,'' he said. ``That's my judgment and I'm very comfortable
with it.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Record of Budget-Balancing In Massachusetts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis
has been variously described as draconian and innovative in his
fiscal policies as governor of Massachusetts, but the record
suggests he met the bottom line in balancing nine state budgets
through good times and bad.
   Criticism lingers about how Dukakis turned a $360 million
revenue shortfall into a $67 million surplus in the fiscal year
that ended June 30.
   And doubts remain about whether the current $11.6 billion budget
_ Dukakis' 10th as governor _ will be in balance when fiscal 1989
ends next June.
   But even as those concerns leave the lips mostly of a small
Republican minority in the Legislature and find their way onto the
national scene in the rhetoric of Dukakis' presidential opponent,
Vice President George Bush, non-partisan experts continue to show
confidence in the Massachusetts economy and the governor's
management of state finances.
   ``There aren't many financial analysts that listen too closely
to politicians; we've been (deceived) too many times by them,''
said bond analyst J. Anthony Naylor, senior vice president with the
New York firm of Rodman & Renshaw Inc.
   In a report this past week, the New York bond rating service,
Standard & Poor's, said it ``expects the state to continue to
achieve sound financial results.'' Earlier this year, S&P gave
Massachusetts its second-highest bond rating, AA-plus, marking the
state's first upgrading since 1984.
   Another major bond rating agency, Moody's Investors Service,
said last month when the commonwealth went to market with $250
million in long-term bonds that the state's ``budgets for both
fiscal 1988 and fiscal 1989 have been balanced.''
   Moody's, which also upgraded Massachusetts' rating to its
second-highest level this year _ the first such increase since 1975
_ noted that the state has ``little financial leeway'' in balancing
fiscal 1989.
   But it said, ``Indicators suggest that the underlying economy
continues to be among the strongest in the country.''
   Bush, most recently in his Thursday night debate with Dukakis,
picked up on one small component of Dukakis' package for balancing
the fiscal 1988 budget. He accused Dukakis of raiding the state's
pension fund reserves of $27 million. Dukakis denied it.
   In fact, Dukakis tapped $27 million in pension funds he
determined to be surplus after meeting immediate state obligations
to the system of about $560 million in fiscal 1988. More than half
the $27 million went to a teachers' pension account and the rest to
pay a general fund shortfall.
   State GOP executive director Alexander Tennant urged the House
back into session last week, contending the fiscal 1989 budget is
as much as $1 billion out of balance.
   Tennant based his assumption on the slow rate of new revenue
generated in the first fiscal quarter. Revenues for the period were
up only 1.2 percent over a year ago, while the state needs a 8.3
percent annual rate to balance the budget. But the first quarter
results were affected by a $68 million payout in corporate
abatements stemming from a tax break the Legislature has now closed.
   The Dukakis administration contends revenues will rebound this
year through a variety of new specialized tax increases, such as
levying the sales tax on cigarettes; increased tax auditing
practices and ending certain tax breaks.
   Richard Manley, president of the non-partisan Massachusetts
Taxpayers Alliance, is not so confident. The foundation estimates a
shortfall of $180 million to $220 million. However, Manley said
that is manageable if the administration demonstrates the same
discipline it showed in fiscal 1988.
   The budget problems the state faced in the past fiscal year
resulted mainly from unexpected changes in taxpayer behavior due to
federal tax law changes, particularly affecting capital gains. As a
result, final revenue growth for the year was 2.1 percent compared
to a budget expectation of 6.6 percent.
   Dukakis was able to balance the books on fiscal 1988 principally
through the largest planned reduction in spending ever attempted in
Massachusetts. Some $233 million was systematically trimmed,
primarily by delaying the start of new programs. The policy caused
disappointment among advocates but little reduction in existing
services.
   The administration also shifted about $185 million in
construction projects scheduled to be paid from general funds to
long-term bonds.
   In the fiscal 1989 budget, which Dukakis proposed in January
before all of the problems surfaced in fiscal 1988, he cut about
$200 million in new and expanded programs while the Legislature was
still debating the bill and vetoed or delayed spending over $200
million more when he signed it into law.
   He also won passage of several new revenue sources: the $33.7
million cigarette sales tax; $75 million from income tax updating;
$180 million from new tax enforcement; and $40 million from
corporate tax changes.
   In 1975, Dukakis inherited a deficit that slowly grew to $560
million out of a budget of $3.8 billion. It forced him to slash
spending for general relief and state employee pay raises and
finally to sign an income surtax, the biggest broad-based tax in
the state's history. The actions contributed to his defeat four
years later and gave Bush the basis to label him a tax-raiser.
   Re-entering the governor's office in 1983, Dukakis inherited
another deficit projected to reach $300 million. This time,
Democratic legislators urged him to go for another big tax
increase, but instead he pushed for smaller spending cutbacks and a
major crackdown on uncollected taxes. The year ended with a $41
million surplus.

<HEAD>Beijing Opens First Venereal Disease Treatment Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beijing has opened its first venereal disease
treatment center to handle the rapid rise in VD cases, the official
China Daily said today.
   The report said the capital will grant $13,500 to the Western
District Venereal Disease Prevention and Treatment Center and plans
to set up other district centers to combat the growing health
problem.
   It said 427 Beijing residents last year were diagnosed as having
gonorrhea, syphilis and other types of VD.
   VD is said to be most serious in southern Guangdong province,
one of China's most open areas bordering Hong Kong. The province
recorded 5,600 cases last year, triple the previous year.
   Venereal disease was a scourge of 20th century,
pre-revolutionary China, especially in the cities, where
prostitution and opium trafficking ran rampant.
   After the communist takeover in 1949, Chinese doctors launched a
campaign to cure venereal disease _ placing prostitutes in
re-education camps and treating victims.
   By the 1960s, China claimed to have virtually wiped out the
diseases. But the problem returned in the 1980s with the nation's
opening to the outside world. Lack of education about the diseases,
and lax enforcement of the ban on prostitution, are also blamed for
the spread of VD.
   The daily said the Beijing center opened with an exhibition of
pictures and videos focusing on the symptoms, means of infection
and harm caused by VD, and on sex and family life. About 100
people, mostly in their 20s and 30s, visited the exhibition during
its first two days.

   President Reagan, with little left on his
agenda but to keep the White House in Republican hands, is
relishing his high-profile role in George Bush's campaign.
   As he attends to the business of signing legislation passed by
Congress in its waning days, Reagan is continuing to stump for Bush
in key battleground states.
   He'll take his ``peace-and-prosperity'' message into the heart
of Ohio this Wednesday, and will increase the campaign pace after
Congress adjourns, possibly this week.
   ``I think the president's thriving. He's enjoying himself. He
thinks he's making a difference,'' White House chief of staff
Kenneth M. Duberstein said recently.
   By all accounts, Reagan's role in Bush's bid for the White House
has gone through an evolution in recent weeks. The president has
stepped up his appeal to the so-called ``Reagan Democrats'' in
Midwestern and Northeastern states, whereas it was once thought he
would play a smaller role.
   ``I was of the impression that they (the Bush campaign) were
going to say, `Go carry California,''' said Democratic consultant
Robert Keefe.
   Some inside both the Bush campaign and the White House had said
early on that Reagan's campaign activities would likely be focused
on California, his home state, and on southern and Sun Belt states,
where Reagan has been immensely popular, even during his hard times.
   One Republican strategist, discussing the changing campaign
route on grounds of anonymity, said it was decided that Reagan
should focus on the key battleground states where there are large
numbers of ethnics, conservative Democrats and independents. And so
Reagan has spent recent weeks in such places as Illinois, Michigan,
Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
   ``Some of the places where the president is strongest have just
solidified for Bush ... much faster than we expected,'' said this
Republican. ``So the question became, do you want to go to a state
where you're 20 points up. ... It obviously makes more sense to
look at the other states that are close.''
   ``I think the role is just right,'' said GOP consultant Eddie
Mahe. ``You're sending your biggest guns into the biggest battles,
and there's no surrogate bigger than Ronald Reagan.''
   Keefe, the Democrat, acknowledged that the strategy of having
Reagan follow Bush into states the vice president has visited
recently has been helpful to the GOP cause.
   ``They have had a marvelous campaign where they have integrated
the message themes very well,'' he said.
   Besides making campaign appearances for his vice president _
Reagan will likely put on a full-court press in California, for
example _ the president has used the trappings of his office to
Bush's benefit.
   Reagan frequently works a pro-Bush pitch into his official
chores, such as bill-signings, whenever he can connect the vice
president to the situation at hand, and throws pro-Bush statements
into his weekly radio addresses.
   Perhaps Reagan's all-out campaign for Bush can be traced to
conversations that both the president and Duberstein had with
former President Richard M. Nixon.
   Nixon is known to believe that the lukewarm support given him by
President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1960 contributed to his loss to
Democrat John F. Kennedy.
   In an interview, Duberstein said that ``Nixon and I spoke
several months ago, and I asked him to give his historical
perspective _ what Eisenhower did and didn't do for him,'' and
Reagan entertained Nixon for a private White House dinner.
   The chief of staff said in an interview that because of these
and other factors, ``I think it's fair to say that Ronald Reagan
has campaigned for his vice president in an unprecedented manner.''
   Keefe agreed with that.
   ``What they have is an extremely commanding voice that can get
himself heard any time he wants to, day or night, and it's just
awfully handy to have someone who can do that,'' he said.

<HEAD>Voracious Ducks Damaging Fish Farms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fish farmers don't believe their crops are for
the birds, but try telling that to a hungry duck, blackbird or
heron.
   ``Birds are a costly problem where fish are cultured,'' says
researcher Vickie D. Martin in a new Agriculture Department report.
``Waterfowl frequently blamed for heavy losses of fish at
aquacultural facilities include diving ducks, herons, egrets,
terns, gulls, kingfishers, blackbirds, ospreys and anhingas.''
   These birds _ the diving ducks include grebes, cormorants and
mergansers _ were described as ``voracious fish eaters'' that not
only cause property loss and damage but can transmit diseases to
fish stock.
   ``Due to fecal contamination and the fact that some of the fish
they consumed are diseased, predatory birds may transmit diseases
from pond to pond,'' she said.
   Moreover, when fish farmers attempt to guard against the
airborne marauders, they can be frustrated because a majority of
the birds are legally categorized as migratory and are protected
under federal and state laws.
   Martin, a student at Fort Valley State College, Fort Valley,
Ga., worked as an intern for the department's Economic Research
Service the last two summers.
   Although there are no figures documenting bird predation by fish
species and location, she said losses to birds have been reported
on baitfish, catfish, shellfish, tropical fish and trout, and are
greatest in the largest aquaculture states: Mississippi, Alabama,
Arkansas, California and Georgia.
   ``Baitfish, particularly minnows, are lost to blackbirds in the
winter, cormorants in the fall and winter, and herons in the
summer,'' Martin said. ``In the Northeast, herons prey on baitfish
in the fall, while trout are harassed by grackles, kingfishers,
herons, ospreys and occasionally owls during the spring, late
summer and early fall.''
   She added that diving ducks are the main bird threats to
shellfish, although swans occasionally are problems.
   ``Catfish in the Southeast are preyed upon most by anhingas
(locally called water turkeys) and kingfishers during the spring
and summer months,'' Martin said. ``Herons and cormorants cause
problems year-round. Crawfish and shrimp are prone to predation by
purple grackles, herons, egrets, ibises, gulls, diving ducks and
kingfishers.''
   Fish ponds can be protected somewhat by barriers such as
perimeter fencing, netting, overhead wires and other devices,
including fireworks, exploders and similar items used to frighten
birds.
   Some chemicals, such as Avitrol, a registered ``frightening
agent'' for use on herring gulls and blackbirds, have also been
effective, she said. But state and federal permits are required to
use this chemical on gulls, because they are legally protected.
   After ingesting the chemical, the gull ``will behave erratically
and emit distress calls,'' which frighten away the other birds, she
said.
   Some migratory game birds may be shot during the hunting season,
and other permits are available for some species. Local state and
federal wildlife authorities should be contacted.
   Still, Martin said, some fish farmers believe ``birds are
uncontrollable and that all frightening tactics are futile, no
matter what method of control of prevention is used.''

   The Agriculture Department has decided to
renew an advisory panel in hopes of out-thinking or out-maneuvering
some of the ``depredating animals'' that cause losses to farmers.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers said losses to farmers from
blackbirds, rodent and coyotes _ which were named as examples _ are
estimated at more than $300 million a year and ``often represent
the difference between profit and loss'' for many producers.
   In recently announcing the renewal of the National Animal Damage
Control Advisory Committee, Myers said the panel serves as a public
forum so that ranchers, farmers and wildlife interests can have a
voice in USDA policies on animal control.
   Members of the committee include scientists, farmers, trade
association representatives, university and government people. The
chairman is Assistant Secretary Kenneth A. Gilles, who oversees
USDA marketing and inspection services.

   Researchers say Southern poultry farmers could
save an estimated $7 million a year by using softer, lower-power
lights in their broiler houses.
   High summer heat makes chickens go off their feed, so producers
keep broiler houses lighted during the summer nights so the birds
will eat during the cooler hours, says James W. Deaton of the
department's Agricultural Research Service.
   Deaton said farmers traditionally use 75- or 100-watt bulbs
because they want to simulate actual daylight.
   ``But our tests show that broiler chickens more than two weeks
old eat normally and gain just as much weight under 25-watt
bulbs,'' he said in a report released here by the agency.
   Deaton, who works at the department's South Central Poultry
Research Laboratory in Mississippi said the annual savings ``could
amount to $7 million across the South, or about $1,000 for a
typical producer who raises about 160,000 chickens during the
summer.''
   The tests also showed that chickens under the dimmer lights
``waste less feed energy in fighting, running around and
chirping,'' he said.

<HEAD>Congresswoman Calls House Civil Rights Compliance Long Overdue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Few were as surprised as Rep. Lynn Martin when
her six-year fight to extend civil rights protection to House
employees finally paid off.
   ``Six years we'd been fighting for this! Sometimes, you'd feel
like you were banging your head against the wall,'' Mrs. Martin
said. ``So I really didn't expect it to happen the way it did.''
   To the Illinois Republican's surprise, members agreed
overwhelmingly this month to end what she calls ``the ultimate
irony,'' their self-enacted exemption from the Civil Rights Act of
1964.
   ``To impose a law, as we did, and then totally exempt oneself is
a kind of hypocrisy that should not have continued this long,''
Mrs. Martin said. ``The House recognized this, finally. It's about
time.''
   The chamber approved a compromise offered by Rep. Leon Panetta,
D-Calif., banning discrimination on the basis of race, age, sex,
religion, handicap or national origin in the hiring and employment
of House committee and staff employees.
   The measure taking effect Nov. 3 also establishes an Office of
Fair Employment Practices to hear discrimination complaints,
mediate disputes and penalize House members who violate the law.
   Mrs. Martin blamed the lack of progress _ until this year _ on
resistance from ``a handful of old dons who run this place like
they had their own little fiefdoms and don't want it to change.''
   ``That's probably true,'' Panetta said Friday. ``There are older
members on both sides of the aisle who resisted ethics reform, too,
when it happened a few years ago. On the other hand, they've been
around long enough to know changes are inevitable. This one was.''
   The Illinois lawmaker began her campaign for the civil rights
legislation in 1982, when a study she requested found inequities
between the salaries paid to male and female employees on Capitol
Hill.
   Although she complained about the disparity to colleagues, Mrs.
Martin said a follow-up survey in 1984 showed little change. She
introduced a bill in January 1985 to require Congress and the
federal judiciary to comply with the Civil Rights Act. The bill
died in subcommittee.
   Last May, after a third study found a continuing gap between pay
for men and that received by women and minorities, she submitted
the bill again. This time, it bore the names of more than 100
co-sponsors.
   The action finally approved Oct. 4 on a 408-12 vote amends House
rules to prohibit discrimination by members.
   The exemption to the civil rights law still applies to the
Senate and the judiciary. However, lawmakers agreed under the
compromise to consider Mrs. Martin's proposal again in June with an
eye to creating a statute that would cover all congressional and
judicial employees.
   Although 12 members voted against the measure, aides said the
votes did not necessarily mean they disagreed with its intent.
   ``The boss went in planning to vote for it,'' said Larry
VanHoose, the administrative assistant to Rep. Larry J. Hopkins,
R-Ky. ``His opposition was purely symbolic.
   ``He is completely in sympathy with Lynn Martin. He just didn't
think the compromise went far enough, because Congress' record
isn't too impressive when it comes to regulating itself.''
   Tish Brink, a spokeswoman for Rep. Thomas D. DeLay, said the
Texas Republican ``objected because he opposes regulation
generally.''
   Meanwhile, Mrs. Martin said she has started getting ``some
fallout'' from members who voted for the change but have
reservations about it.
   For example, an aide said one complained that eliminating the
Civil Rights Act exemption would force him to fire some female
employees because he had more women on his staff than men.
   That concern is unfounded, Mrs. Martin said.
   ``I'm sure there is a down side to this somewhere,'' she added.
``I'll get the blame for any problem, there's no question about
that. But occasionally, you do the right thing. This one, I've got
no regrets on.''

   The 100th Congress plans to adjourn this week
once it clears its desk of unfinished business including a
campaign-year attack in the war on drugs.
   The fate of dozens of bills lies in the balance as the House and
Senate begin what both sides agree will be the last week of the
two-year Congress. The biggest of the bills is a massive anti-drug
package passed by the Senate last Friday.
   The Senate bill isn't as tough on drug users as one passed
earlier by the House and negotiators from both bodies will be
meeting to try to resolve the differences. If they agree on a
single package, a final vote will be needed in the House and in the
Senate before it can go to President Reagan for enactment into law.
   House and Senate negotiators were bogged down on another major
legislative package _ so-called technical corrections to a 1986 tax
bill. In addition to making technical corrections to that bill, the
proposal included selected new tax reductions, the tax increases to
pay for them, and a ``bill of rights'' for taxpayers facing
enforcement or collection action from the Internal Revenue Service.
   Differences in the House and Senate versions of the bill were so
sharp that negotiations broke down Friday and an aide to House
negotiators said ``whether the conference gets back together at all
again is very much up in the air.''
   On the other end of the priority list were bills ranging from
legislation designed to assist individual people, nominations of
federal judges, water projects affecting specific cities and states
and a plan to end the United States' trusteeship over the western
Pacific island nation of Palau.
   Yet another bill that could make it under the wire would elevate
the Veterans Administration to Cabinet-level status.
   The fate of each of them was up in the air as members, already
in Washington for a week or two longer than they had hoped, strive
toward an adjournment that will let them go home and campaign for
re-election.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., told senators on
Friday that ``I certainly would hope we wouldn't have to stay
beyond Wednesday. But nobody can predict that.''
   The House returns from a long weekend on Tuesday with a
scheduled vote on legislation that would require full disclosure of
credit card information to consumers.
   The bill, passed by the Senate last week, requires that banks,
department stores and other companies that offer credit cards tell
consumers about annual fees, interest rates, late fees and other
information.
   Currently, only a few states have laws requiring public
disclosure of such information before consumers receive the cards.
   Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the House
Banking Committee, called the measure ``one of the most important
and strongest credit disclosure acts that we have been able to move
through the Congress since the first truth-in-lending statute was
passed 20 years ago.''
   Also pending is legislation providing first-ever restrictions on
lobbying by former members of Congress, part of a general
tightening of federal rules against influence peddling by top
government officials.
   The legislation has passed both houses of Congress in different
versions and a compromise will have to be worked out before it can
win final approval and be sent to Reagan.
   The bill covers not only lobbying, but any communication done
for pay to influence government decisions, including writing
letters, filing motions or granting requests.
   It would prevent members of Congress and senior staff members,
for one year after leaving office, from contacting the legislative
house in which they served. The restrictions also would apply to
lobbying for pay by anyone from the president and vice president on
down through the top several thousand executive-branch policy
makers.

<TEXT>
   George Bush can count on solid backing Nov. 8
from the nation's former spies, who are making no secret of their
support for the Republican candidate.
   ``This is 99 percent Bush country,'' said Henry Houkal, a former
CIA official attending a two-day annual convention of the
Association of Former Intelligence Officers over the weekend.
   In the tightly knit intelligence community, former spies feel a
kinship with Bush, who served as the CIA's director for a year in
1976 in the Ford administration. President Jimmy Carter dismissed
Bush after the Democrats regained the White House.
   The association does not formally take stands on political
issues, but it isn't difficult to determine most members'
allegiance.
   James E. Treher, a former FBI agent from Pittsburgh who worked
in counterintelligence, said he feared that Democrat Michael
Dukakis, if elected, would put ``liberal restrictions'' on the CIA.
   He said that could result in the ``greatest disaster'' in
intelligence-gathering since the so-called Church committee, the
congressional investigation that revealed the CIA had tried to
murder foreign leaders and destabilize governments.
   Bush found the CIA reeling from the committee's revelations.
   The consensus among several ex-spies was that Bush boosted the
agency's morale in his short tenure by going along with the
recommendations of the professional staff and interfering little in
their work.
   Houkal that he was involved in a policy change and Bush ``just
signed off on it.''
   ``It was a tranquil operation,'' added L.A. Shirito, who now
works for Union Carbide. ``I am a Bush admirer from those days.''
   Despite his hands-off management style, Bush formed some close
ties at the agency, including one with Donald Gregg, an ex-CIA man
who has served as one of the vice president's top foreign police
advisers.
   Like others, Houkal said Bush will probably ``leave the agency
alone'' if he moves to the White House. William Webster, a former
FBI chief, was appointed to head the agency after William Casey,
President Reagan's friend, died in May 1987.
   One reason the former sleuths want to see Republicans remain in
control of the White House is their belief that intelligence
agencies have prospered during the last eight years.
   Several present and former CIA officials praised Casey for
beefing up the agency and improving its analytical capabilities.
   Robert M. Gates, the CIA deputy director, said Congress also has
helped the agency by boosting its appropriations in the last
decade. Congressional review of the intelligence process ``has
given a growing number of members of Congress an idea of what we
really do for a living.''
   Douglas George, a CIA analyst, said he worked closely with Casey
on arms control issues, and the former CIA head never leaned on
staffers to play with the facts so they jibed with policy views.
   ``He kept his fingers off intelligence,'' George said.
   But Helene Boatner, another CIA analyst, said Casey had strong,
forceful views that may have prompted the analysts to self-censor
their product. ``His personal views tended to have an impact,'' she
said.
   She noted, however, there is always a tension between analysts
and policy-makers because the facts never fit squarely with the
views of those who formulate policy. ``The news from the analysts
is usually bad,'' she said.
   Boatner was critical, though, of Bob Woodward's book, ``Veil:
The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981-1987.'' The book describes how
Casey and Reagan committed the nation to new and expanded covert
wars in Central America and elsewhere.
   ``I know things in the book that are true and I know things in
the book that are dead wrong,'' she said.
   Since the early 1980s, the analysts said, gathering and
interpretation of information has improved. The Reagan
administration has invested heavily in equipment to collect facts
and in training analysts.
   ``The nation had made a pretty spiffy investment in people,''
George said.
   Among other things, the CIA has sought more experienced
analysts, expanded their training and tried to improve their work
by giving them more time to travel and take sabbaticals.
   ``They are a promising lot,'' Boatner said of the new breed of
analysts.
   Gates said the agency is doing ``as well if not better than we
ever have'' in recruiting with about 150,000 inquiries a year. The
CIA entertains about 1,000 serious applications a month. Still, the
CIA has problems recruiting specialists such as ``world class
chemists and nuclear engineers.''
   John Greaney, AFIO's executive director, said 250 people
attended the convention, up from last year. The association, which
has a membership of over 3,000, is dedicated to promoting strong
intelligence operations.

<HEAD>`No-Fault' Libel Trials Recommended</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major study of libel laws today recommended
sweeping changes designed to resolve disputes quickly through ``no
fault'' trials deciding the truth of disputed statements.
   No damages would be awarded in such trials.
   The changes were proposed by the Washington-based Annenberg
Washington Program of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.,
after a study begun last winter by 11 lawyers, judges, journalists
and others.
   ``Libel suits tend to drag on interminably, are enormously
costly for both sides and very seldom clearly resolve what ought to
be the heart of the matter: the truth or falsity of what was
published,'' said the report of the Libel Reform Project.
   A major change from current law in the proposal would be
elimination of the requirement that public figures suing for libel
prove that defamatory statements about them were published with
``actual malice,'' that is, with knowledge that they were false or
with ``reckless disregard'' of whether they were false or not.
   Newton W. Minow, director of the Annenberg Washington Program,
summed up the advantages of the new procedures this way:
   ``The plaintiffs in a no-fault trial get a quicker verdict on
whether they were defamed or not and, if they win, get their
attorney's fees paid by the other side, but they give up a shot at
money damages.
   ``The news media on the defense get relief from the chilling
effects of huge, emotionally based damage awards, but they give up
the Times vs. Sullivan protections that have restricted libel
rulings.''
   Times vs. Sullivan was a 1964 case in which the U.S. Supreme
Court refused to award damages to a public official without a
showing of malice.
   As it stands now, ``the present law is not adequately protecting
the reputations of people who have been defamed. And it's not
protecting journalists' freedom to report _ vigorously and fairly _
the truth as they can best determine it,'' Minow said.
   Here are the main changes from current law incorporated in a
model statute recommended to the states and federal government:
   _No suit for defamation could be filed unless the plaintiff had
been refused a prompt retraction or chance to reply. Retractions or
replies for candidates for office would have to be made before a
coming election.
   _All such suits would have to charge that the defendant made a
false factual statement that was defamatory _ tended to injure the
plaintiff's reputation. Such a lawsuit could not be smuggled into
court under another name, such as invasion of privacy.
   _No one could sue over statements of opinion, such as an
editorial cartoon. In determining what is fact, courts could
consider the extent to which a statement could be proved
objectively and the extent to which exaggeration for rhetorical
effect was intended.
   _Most trials would be for ``declaratory judgment,'' with the
loser paying the legal costs of the winner. Such trials would have
to begin within 120 days. The only issue would be the truth,
according to the judgment of the jury or, if the parties agree, the
judge.
   _A conventional trial for money damages could not be held unless
both sides agreed, and even then damages would be limited to the
plaintiff's actual loss _ there could be no punitive damages.
However, the loss might not be all financial _ a plaintiff could be
compensated for humiliation, for instance.
   _The plaintiff would have the burden of proof _ the duty to show
by ``clear and convincing evidence'' that the disputed statement
was false.
   _The mere repetition of statements about matters of public
interest could not be the subject of a lawsuit if the originator
were identified, and there could be no inquiry into the state of
mind of the defendant. This would be a major change from current
law, which generally treats repetitions like original statements.
   _There would be no distinction between slander, which is oral
defamation, and libel, written defamation. There would be no
distinction between news media or other defendants.
   _The current exemption for statements made in official
legislative, judicial or administrative proceedings would be
retained.

   This small bucolic nation hopes to change the
television landscape in Western Europe with the launching of its
Astra satellite on Dec. 9.
   An Ariane rocket of the European space consortium is to send
Astra into orbit and if the project is successful millions of
viewers will need only satellite dishes the size of an umbrella to
receive TV broadcasts without paying for the service.
   Astra, the project of Luxembourg's Societe Europeenne des
Satellites, will be the first one capable of beaming a package of
16 channels directly to homes in the most densely populated areas
of Europe.
   Programming scheduled so far is to be financed through
advertising revenues.
   Low-power satellite signals now require big and expensive
dishes. These signals are primarily distributed by cable networks
that charge the viewers, limiting the audience.
   But the medium-power Astra will beam channels directly to homes
that will require only a dish costing about the same as a video
recorder.
   ``A medium-power satellite was most suited to mass market TV,
and Astra will be the first of its generation,'' Prime Minister
Jacques Santer said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   ``In the early 1980s we realized much was happening in the
audiovisual media,'' he said.
   At that time the broadcast monopolies of European governments
began to fade with the advent of cable TV and the prospect of
continent-wide satellite broadcasts.
   ``We took our chances to push through innovations,'' Santer said
of the Astra project. ``All of Europe is still virgin territory for
television.''
   The Luxembourg government initiated the Astra project in 1983.
It has a 20 percent share in the Societe Europeenne des Satellites,
which has $85 million in capital, and has agreed to cover risks of
up to $125 million.
   Eight of the 15 other shareholders are Luxembourg companies and
the satellite's control center is in Betzdorf, 13 miles east of the
capital.
   Santer hopes Astra will generate income for the nation from new
TV productions.
   ``A satellite is only a transmission tool. We must also produce
programs. That's the second important factor,'' he said.
   Parliament is expected to enact a law soon giving tax breaks for
audiovisual enterprises to set up shop in this nation surrounded by
Belgium, France and West Germany.
   Santer expects this will lure producers of situation comedies,
variety shows and other projects that are cost-efficient and carry
relatively little commercial risk.
   With Astra and its related TV production initiatives, Luxembourg
has its sights set on 1992, when the 12-nation European Economic
Community plans to forge a single European market for its
industries.
   The EEC has estimated satellite television will generate $11
billion in business for makers of reception dishes, decoders, other
equipment and advertisers over the next five to seven years.
   ``Why can we not succeed where the Americans were so
successful?'' said Santer. ``Europe must put a greater effort into
TV technology and programming.''
   Despite such lofty European ideals, Astra is a U.S.-made
RCA-4000 satellite and the Luxembourg company has signed its first
contract for four channels with media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, an
American citizen.
   Through Astra, Murdoch will target a market of over 80 million
homes in Western Europe. It will give areas not served by cable
companies and limited to only a few national networks more choice.
   Astra's key markets are Britain, West Germany, France, Austria,
Switzerland, northern Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and
Luxembourg. Viewers in many other nations will be able to tune in,
but with a larger dish.
   While many competitive satellite projects are still on the
drawing board, Astra is to begin transmissions in early 1989.
   The organization has signed a 10-year contract with Murdoch for
his entertainment unit Sky Channel and movie, sports and news
channels.
   U.S. media magnate Ted Turner is negotiating for a channel,
sources said on condition of anonymity.
   But too many English-speaking programs would dent the European
goal, even though each one can be received in different languages,
according to Santer.
   ``We must diversify,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   With South African troops out of southern
Angola, rebel leader Jonas Savimbi says his UNITA guerrillas face a
tougher military struggle but have gained support in the United
States and Africa.
   Guerrilla officers promise few prolonged battles of the kind
that UNITA and South African forces waged early this year in the
siege of Cuito Cuanavale.
   Angolan government units were temporarily driven out of the
southern town, they say. But, eight months later, UNITA is back in
defensive positions east of Cuito, awaiting an enemy campaign.
   The departure of several thousand South African soldiers seven
weeks ago, as part of regional peace negotiations, ``has weakened
our position,'' Savimbi said in a recent interview.
   But he said the South African move has bolstered UNITA's
credibility as an independent force and has increased diplomatic
pressure on the Angolan government to negotiate a settlement.
   The declared goal of UNITA _ the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola _ is to force the ruling Popular Movement
for the Independence of Angola into a power-sharing arrangement
leading to national elections.
   Savimbi expressed confidence that UNITA, relying on traditional
guerrilla advantages of speed and surprise, can maintain the
stalemate in Angola's 13-year civil war.
   ``We cannot come out without wounds. But we can sustain some
wounds,'' Savimbi said.
   ``For sure, Jamba will never fall,'' Savimbi said, referring to
UNITA's bush headquarters in southeastern Angola. ``They will pay
such a heavy price _ I think they will not try.''
   UNITA says it has 37,000 guerrillas and 28,000 regular soldiers,
nearly half as many as the government's more heavily armed 80,000
soldiers and the 50,000 Cuban troops on its side.
   Negotiations involving Angola, Cuba, South Africa and the United
States are aimed at an agreement by Nov. 1 for a Cuban withdrawal.
In return, South Africa would allow implementation of a United
Nations independence plan for South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia.
   The Marxist Angolan government ``cannot stand alone without the
Cubans,'' Savimbi said during the interview at an unmapped forest
supply camp near Mavinga, about 80 miles from forward UNITA
positions.
   ``African countries are giving much more sympathy since the
South Africans left,'' Savimbi said. He named Zambia, Togo,
Morocco, Senegal, Nigeria, Kenya, Cameroon, Chad, Guinea, Mali,
Egypt, Zaire and Ivory Coast as sympathetic to UNITA's cause.
   He said liberal U.S. Democrats, Sens. Paul Simon of Illinois and
Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, told him during a visit to the
United States this year that the main barrier to their
understanding ``was the direct involvement of South Africa.''
   ``Now we are working very well,'' he said of the Democrats.
   Brig. Peregrino Chindondo, UNITA's intelligence chief, said
guerrillas caused serious Cuban casualties and burned eight Cuban
vehicles in a raid Oct. 6 on a convoy near the central highlands
city of Huambo. He said 25 vehicles were seized Oct. 3 when UNITA
took Sanzo Pombo in the northern Uige Province.
   ``The morale of the enemy is very bad,'' Chindondo said. ``Most
are recruited in round-up operations. There is friction with the
Cubans. They have lost the support of the people.''
   During an 11-day tour of UNITA bases in southeastern Angola,
where the movement effectively governs one-third of the country,
reporters visited a guerrilla command post 3 miles from enemy lines
at Cuito Cuanavale. There they talked with Angolan prisoner of war
Julio Wango, 25, a few hours after he was captured in a skirmish.
   Wounds on Wango's head and elbows were bandaged. He was barefoot
and UNITA officers said it was customary to remove prisoners' boots
so they could not escape.
   Wango said he had fled his village near Ganda, in Benguela
Province, to avoid military service but was caught by a government
squad in a cornfield in March.
   ``They beat me and told me I was a crook for trying to escape,''
Wango said. ``They gave me three months' training and made me a
sergeant.''
   ``In the army, we don't have any food, no breakfast. People are
weak and fall while on duty,'' Wango said. ``The only ones getting
good food are Cubans.
   ``Once I ran away to another brigade to trade beads for
something to eat. They found me and put me in confinement for five
days.''

   A Uganda Airlines Boeing 707 jetliner with 51 people
aboard crashed early Monday in heavy fog short of the runway of
Rome's main Leonardo da Vinci airport. Police said 29 people were
feared dead.
   Twenty-two people survived Flight 775, said Carlo Iovinella,
director of the airport police. The flight was en route from
London's Gatwick Airport to Entebbe, Uganda, with an intermediate
stop in Rome.
   Iovinella said 44 passengers and a crew of seven were aboard the
jetliner that crashed at 12:31 a.m. (7:31 p.m. EDT Sunday).
However, Gatwick Hangling, agents for Uganda Airlines at the London
airport, said there were 45 passengers and a crew of seven. The
discrepancy could not be immediately resolved.
   The aircraft skimmed the tops of some trees, then crashed, broke
into pieces and burst into flames about a half-mile west of the
runway, police said. The airport is 15 miles southwest of Rome.
   The charred hulk of the airliner lay smoking in a muddy field
early Monday while firefighters raked through the debris. Two
bodies covered with sheets lay near the shattered aircraft. Seat
cushions, boxes, a makeup case and a twisted doll were scattered
nearby in the mud.
   The front of the jetliner was a charred skeleton of a plane. The
fuselage was snapped where it joined the wings and the cockpit
section was broken into hundreds of pieces. The airline's
distinctive red and yellow stripes along the scorched fuselage
could barely be seen.
   Iovinella said 23 survivors had been taken to nearby hospitals
and that the rest of the people aboard were believed to be dead.
Fifteen of the injured were taken to Rome's Sant'Eugenio Hospital;
others went to San Camillo Hospital and Ostia Hospital.
   A police officer at Sant'Eugenio, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said an unidentified Uganda woman was dead on arrival at
the hospital. He said the injured, who were being treated for burns
and fractures, included 12 Ugandans, six in grave condition, and
three Britons.
   The Britons were identified as Geoffrey Gatt, his wife Ruth and
their 2-year-old son Richard. Their hometown was not immediately
availabale.
   Police said they did not immediately know the nationalities of
the others aboard the flight.
   Iovinella said the cause of the crash had not been determined.
But the entire area along the Tyrrhenian Coast near the airport had
been shrouded in a heavy fog.
   ``It was definitely the fog,'' said one police officer, speaking
on condition of anonymity, when asked about a possible cause of the
crash.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said the tower gave permission for
the plane to land and reported a visibility of 4,920 feet. It said
the tower called the plane again when it didn't respond. Moments
later, it said, workers saw a big fire at the end of the runway.
   Firefighters took nearly an hour to put out the flames.
   Authorities closed the airport to traffic shortly after the
crash and diverted all incoming flights to Rome's Ciampino Airport,
which normally handles mostly military and charter traffic.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews Sept. 6-14 with 1,125 adults in the
continental United States. The phone numbers were selected randomly
by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult who had
the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if
every adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be within plus or minus 3 points of the poll's
results, 19 times out of 20.
   The margin of error is higher for subgroups _ 7 points, for
example, for respondents earning $50,000 or more a year.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, some totals may not
total 100:

<HEAD>Brawl Erupts Between Americans And Koreans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 40 U.S. soldiers brandishing
jacknives and broken bottles brawled with rock-throwing South
Koreans in the capital's shopping district. An American and a South
Korean were hospitalized, officials said today.
   News reports said one American and three Koreans were injured in
the clash early Sunday, and one of the Koreans was in critical
condition.
   According to a military press release, the incident in the
nightclub section of Itaewon was sparked by a verbal altercation
between a Korean taxi driver and an American soldier. The argument
escalated into an assault involving four Americans and a number of
Koreans.
   Itaewon is a a shopping district close to the U.S. Forces Korea
Headquarters in Seoul.
   South Korean police officials said the four Americans suddenly
began cursing at the taxi driver, Lee Ok-Chul, 51, and kicked his
cab on a street corner. Lee was quoted as saying that when he got
of his car and protested, the Americans punched him in the face and
some even climbed on top of his car.
   The officials said about 40 Koreans rushed to Lee's aid. The
Americans then fled, brandishing empty beer bottles and throwing
rocks at the pursuing crowd.
   When Korean passers-by jeered at the fleeing Americans, police
said about 40 other American soldiers joined in and brandished jack
knives and broken beer bottle at the Koreans, who countered by
throwing rocks.
   The Koreans, whose number had swelled to about 200 by then,
shouted ``Yankee go home,'' in front of a nightclub into which the
Americans had fled, the officials said.
   About 200 police who arrived at the scene dispersed the crowd of
Koreans. The four unidentified soldiers involved in the initial
altercation were booked for investigation and turned over to U.S.
miltiary authorities, the police said.
   Officials did not release the names of the injured and it was
not immediately clear when the injuries occurred.

   Emperor Hirohito discharged more blood today but
his condition remains stable, officials said.
   The crown prince and other members of the imperial family
meanwhile attended an annual harvest festival.
   Hirohito, 87, discharged a small amount of blood ``on several
occasions'' Sunday night through this morning, Imperial Household
Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda told palace reporters.
   The world's longest-reigning monarch, who has discharged small
amounts of blood since Saturday, was given a transfusion of 0.84
pints of blood Sunday, bringing the total he has received since
vomiting blood Sept. 19 to 17.4 pints.
   The transfusions were administered to help the emperor combat
anemia and supplement blood lost in internal bleeding, according to
palace officials.
   The rite, called Kannamesai, includes offering prayers in the
direction of the Ise Shrine, where the sun goddess is worshipped,
and presenting sacred offerings at a small shrine on the palace
grounds, according to palace spokesman Chifuru Ashizawa.
   ``The Kannamesai is an imperial festival giving thanks to the
gods by offering newly harvested crops,'' Ashizawa said.

<HEAD>Slaughter Puts Focus On Rancher-Wild Horse Competition For
Rangeland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The slaughters of at least 450 wild horses
have brought into focus a long-running conflict between the
mustangs and ranchers who both depend on the state's rangeland for
survival.
   Officials discovered the first mass slaughter in August when 41
carcasses were spotted by helicopter near Austin in central Nevada.
Since then, other major finds include discovery of about 180
carcasses on Oct. 8-9.
   Officials estimate that the horses had been shot between two
years ago and early this summer.
   ``What we have here is the kind of carnage that indicates an
all-out war against the wild horses,'' Bureau of Land Management
spokesman Bob Stewart said last week.
   BLM officials refuse to comment on whether they have any
suspects or leads.
   Delloyd Satterthwaite, president of the Nevada Cattlemen's
Association, acknowledged speculation that the gunmen were ranchers
who have grown tired of the beautiful but destructive animals.
   ``I'm as shocked as anyone about this,'' Satterthwaite said.
``But it's true, ranchers don't like them. The (horse) population
is out of control and something has to be done or they'll ruin it
for everybody.''
   Ranchers consider the mustangs pests because they drink scarce
water, graze land used to fatten livestock, and tear up fences. But
others consider the wild horse a last vestige of the Old West.
   Champions of the horses also say they are the closest thing left
in this country to pure mustangs, the horses brought here in the
1500s by Spanish conquistadors. Foes say the animals have little or
no such blood.
   The 1971 Wild and Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act sought to
reconcile the interests of both sides. The act declared the
mustangs protected wards of the state and made their killing a
misdemeanor punishable by up to a $2,000 fine and one year in jail.
   The law also allowed the BLM to round up some horses for
adoption or placement in sanctuaries to control the size of the
wild herds and prevent overgrazing.
   Some ranchers say the control efforts have failed. According to
estimates, the number of mustangs on the nation's ranges has grown
from about 17,000 in 1971 to about 40,000 now, of which about
28,000 are in Nevada alone.
   ``When they passed that law, they promised they would control
the population,'' Satterthwaite said. ``They didn't fulfill that
commitment.''
   The situation may get worse before it improves. Last month, the
BLM announced it was ending its free mass adoption program, which
waived a $125-a-head adoption fee for anyone taking 100 or more
horses.
   Animal rights activists had argued that the program allowed
people to make a profit by selling adopted horses to
slaughterhouses to be used for dog food, glue or other commercial
purposes.
   The BLM still allows people to adopt up to four horses a year
for $125 each and is seeking to build sanctuaries that could serve
as places for people to view the animals.
   ``The wild horse may have some historical value to some people
but it does not serve mankind like cattle or sheep,'' Satterthwaite
said.
   ``They should be treated like deer. When the herd gets too
large, they have a hunting season on does. I'm not saying kill the
horses, but control them.''

<HEAD>Gulf Ministers Ready To Raise Production Ceiling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABDULLAH AL-SHIHRI</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia and its partners in the
six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council are ready to raise OPEC's
overall production ceiling to try to stabilize prices, according to
a statement released today.
   The move, made public following a meeting of the council's oil
ministers Sunday, appeared to defer to neighboring Iraq in giving
it the same quota as Iran.
   Emerging from their 8-year-old conflict, both Iran and Iraq have
said they will need to pump as much oil as they deem necessary to
finance post-war reconstruction projects.
   The council set one basic condition for the higher ceiling:
adherence by all OPEC members to any production levels agreed upon.
They also called for cooperation by oil producers outside the
cartel.
   The ministers of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and
the United Arab Emirates called the meeting to try to forge a joint
strategy to help OPEC prop up oil prices, deteriorating due to a
market glut.
   The press statement, carried by the official Saudi press agency,
said the council members ``affirmed their quest to stabilize the
world oil market on condition that this be the position of the
other oil producers inside and outside OPEC.''
   It said the council states were ready to follow an overall
production ceiling of 17.429 million barrels per day for the 13
members ``or any higher ceiling upon which agreement is reached
within the organization.''
   The 17.429 million barrel figure seemed to give Iraq parity with
Iran's quota of 2.36 million barrels per day. The current ceiling
for the 12 nations without Iraq is 15.06 million barrels per day.
   Iraq's quota under the 1986 agreement was 1.54 million barrels.
The statement did not clearly state that Iraq was getting a higher
quota and no one could be reached for clarification.
   The statement also said any quota increase would be distributed
in the same ratios as the current quotas.
   Members have been pumping at least 3 million barrels per day
over the agreed on production ceiling. The call to increase the
ceiling appeared aimed at gaining some control over the market,
even if falling short of the $18-per- barrel price that the current
ceiling was supposed to bring. Oil was trading at around $8 below
that mark in recent weeks.
   Baghdad has ignored its limit and is producing at the rate of
2.7 million barrels per day. Iran tried to produce above its quota
but damage to its facilities during the war kept it pumping at its
assigned level.
   Iraq has suggested it will cooperate with OPEC. Iran's
parliamentary speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, said Friday that there
was ``no reason to quarrel with the countries on the southern coast
of the gulf'' over the oil market.
   The United Arab Emirates also publicly renounced its quota,
producing 1.5 million barrels daily as opposed to the 948,000
barrels sanctioned by OPEC.
   Saudi Arabia announced it would no longer cut production and
sacrifice its revenue to defend prices. It has overshot its quota
of 4.3 million barrels per day in recent weeks to pressure the
overproducers into respecting the quota system.
   Four of the six council members _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar
and the United Arab Emirates _ are ranking members of the 13-nation
OPEC. The two others, Oman and Bahrain, are not OPEC members but
their economies depend on oil export revenues.

   Callers learned later that they had been talking to Jefferson
County sheriff's detectives, who raided a home in Quilcene early
Friday. Detectives found less than a pound of cocaine and loaded
firearms, and arrested two people when the raid began.
   By the time it ended Saturday afternoon, 10 people were
arrested, and more than $2,500 and five vehicles were confiscated,
said Sheriff Mel Mefford.
   While detectives were searching the house, the phone kept
ringing, so they answered and told prospective buyers, ``Well,
sure, come on down,'' Mefford said.
   ``I suppose if we had stayed there, we could have been (making
arrests) there for days,'' he said.

   President Roh Tae-woo said today he
will present a peace plan for the divided Korean peninsula when he
addresses the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday.
   Roh left today to address the United Nations for the first time
as a South Korean head of state.
   Prior to his departure, Roh told a news conference he will
unveil a new policy of unification between South and North Korea
and a ``northern policy'' aimed at improving relations with
communist countries such as the Soviet Union and China.
   Seoul has been trying to improve relations with Moscow, Beijing
and other communist countries hoping that it would have a positive
effect on reunfication efforts.
   These communist countries have so far been allies of North
Korea, although some of them, such as the Soviet Union and Hungary,
recently agreed to exchnage trade offices or permanent missions
with Seoul.
   The capitalist south has no diplomatic ties with any communist
country.
   Following the U.N. address Roh will fly to Washington to lunch
with President Reagan on Thursday. Those talks will also focuss on
Korean peace efforts, Seoul officials said.
   South and North Korea are not U.N. members, but the world body
has decided to hear speeches from both. North Korea's first deputy
minister of foreign affairs, Kang Sok Ju, speaks Wednesday.
   The two Koreas have been bitter enemies since their land was
divided at the end of World War II in 1945. They still are
technically at war, since no peace treaty was signed after the
Korean War in 1950-53 ended in an armistice.
   The two Korean states have held rapprochement talks on an off
since the early 1970s but failed to make progress. Lawmakers of
both sides began talks in August with little progress.
   One senior government party official, requesting anonymity, said
Roh's speech may cover some sensitive matters, including arms
reductions by the two Koreas, which Seoul officials have so far
been reluctant to discuss openly.
   In his latest peace proposal early this month, Roh renewed a
call for summit talks with North Korean President Kim Il Sung, and
said he is ready to end rivalry and confrontation.
   ``Circumstances affecting unification have changed completely
from the past,'' Roh said in a major policy speech two days after
the Seoul Olympics ended Oct. 2.
   The president said the Olympics, which attracted athletes from a
record 160 countries, including most communist-bloc nations, have
enhanced South Korea's stature in the international society and
boosted chances for improved relations with North Korea.
   Improved relations between East and West and the Soviet Union
and China are also creating a favorable environment for Seoul and
Pyongyang to thaw 40 years of icy relations, he said.
   Roh said his government was drafting a new unification formula,
which he said ``should be practicable and acceptable to both
sides.''
   Observers in Seoul think Roh may drop hints at or even outline
South Korea's new unification formula.
   Not surprisingly, Roh's recent peace initiatives have received
cool response from North Korea, which always prefers a quick
lump-sum political settlement of issues to gradual, step-by-step
approaches being pushed by South Korea.
   But, in what appeared to be somewhat encouraging development,
North Korea conditionally welcomed Roh's proposal for an
inter-Korea summit, according to Seoul officials.
   In its first official response to the proposed summit, North
Korea said Saturday it would welcome Roh to visit Pyongyang only
after South Korea has repealed its staunch anti-communist system
and agreed to tackle political and military matters first.
   One thorny issue is a North Korean demand for withdrawal of the
42,000 U.S. troops stationed in the South. North Korea maintains
that no thaw in relations with South Korea would be possible as
long as the American troops remain.

   President Corazon Aquino urged the
public today to await details before judging a new agreement on
U.S. military bases, but lawmakers said the government had accepted
too little money.
   Groups opposed to the presence of U.S. troops branded the
agreement a ``sell-out,'' and one senator said he hoped the
agreement would respect a Philippine ban on nuclear weapons in its
territory.
   Another senator said an unsatisfactory agreement will speed up
legislation requiring the Aquino government to give Washington
notice it will close the six bases when their lease expires in 1991.
   In Washington on Sunday, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said
the United States has agreed to pay $481 million annually and back
a bond program to help ease the country's foreign debt as part of a
lease agreement for the bases.
   Philippine sources said Manglapus originally asked for $1.2
billion over two years for use of the two largest U.S. bases abroad
_ Clark Air Base and Subic Navy Base _ and four smaller
installations.
   Manglapus said Mrs. Aquino gave him a ``go signal'' to sign the
pact in Washington today. Cash payments would be a big increase
over the current $180 million in U.S. military and economic aid
attached to the bases, but less than half that sought by the
Philippines when talks began in April.
   Mrs. Aquino was asked by reporters today whether she considered
the talks successful.
   ``Why don't we just wait until all the details are laid out and
expressed by Secretary Manglapus,'' she said.
   The left-wing Peoples Party denounced the agreement as a
``sell-out'' and said Manglapus should not have linked the
continued presence of foreign troops to the debt issue.
   Party spokesman Fidel Agcaoili said the two issues should have
been negotiated separately to strengthen the Philippine bargaining
stand.
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, chairman of the Senate Defense Committee,
said the reported agreement ``is a confirmation of the fact that it
seems that this administration is not ready yet to stand up to
Washington.''
   Maceda said the Senate ``would be inclined'' to begin debate on
a proposal filed months ago by majority leader Sen. Orlando Mercado
to serve notice that the bases will be closed in 1991.
   Without such notification, Maceda said the bases agreement would
be automatically renewed. The new Constitution requires that any
extension beyond 1991 be approved by two-thirds of the 23-member
Senate, where anti-bases sentiment is strong.
   But Rep. Gualberto Lumauig, a member of the House of
Representatives Foreign Relations Committee, termed the agreement
``welcome news'' because it would mean more money for the country
as it tries to cope with a $28 billion foreign debt.
   The Manila Stock Exchange opened 4.54 points higher today than
Friday's close of 725.52. Traders said the increase was due in part
to reports the United States and the Philippines reached a bases
agreement.
   Sen. Wigberto Tanada, a leading bases opponent, said financial
compensation was not the only issue.
   ``I don't think it is enough to settle the issue of compensation
if the threat of national destruction due to nuclear weapons and
the derogation of national sovereignty is still there,'' Tanada
said.
   Tanada was chief sponsor of a bill approved by the Senate this
year which would ban nuclear weapons from Clark, Subic Bay and the
four smaller installations. The legislation is pending in the House.
   The agreement would cover only the final two years of the 1947
Military Bases Agreement, which expires in 1991. Mrs. Aquino has
refused to say whether she will support extending the agreement,
which runs out one year before her term expires.

   A man died in an unsuccessful effort to save his
drowning wife on their first outing in a 12-foot aluminum boat
retrieved from a neighbor's trash, police and friends said.
   The boat was overloaded with three adults and their fishing
tackle when it capsized early Sunday on Miller Lake, Metro-Dade
homicide Detective Lawrence Wilkotz said.
   Candida Llanez, 61, didn't know how to swim, and her 63-year-old
husband, Manuel, tried desperately to save her, struggling to pull
her ashore as their clothes became weighted down with water,
Wilkotz said.
   Their companion, Abelardo Ruiz, 50, swam safely to shore, but
Llanez was dead when police arrived. Rescue workers found his
wife's body floating in the lake.
   Friends of the Miami couple told The Miami Herald the boat had
been discarded by a neighbor.

   Thousands of people rode riverboats and lined
the Ohio River's shores on the closing day of the city's ``Tall
Stacks'' celebration in conjunction with the city's bicentennial.
   The weekend festival concluded Sunday evening with fireworks
displays after a friendly race between the Belle of Louisville and
the Delta Queen, which won.
   Jay Downie, events producer for the Greater Cincinnati
Bicentennial Commission, estimated Sunday's crowd at 300,000. He
and David Rager, assistant safety director for Cincinnati, said
about a million people attended the four-day ``Tall Stacks''
celebration.
   Fourteen riverboats and excursion boats gathered along the Ohio
River for the festival, which included tours, cruises and races.
The biggest race was Sunday between the Delta Queen and the Belle
of Louisville, the only two authentic steam-powered, paddlewheel
boats at the celebration.
   The riverboats have met in Louisville for annual Derby Week
races since 1963, when the excursion boat Avalon was restored and
christened Belle of Louisville. River historian C.W. Stoll said
with the Belle's most recent victory in May, it leads the races,
13-11.
   Atop her Hurricane Deck, the Belle sports a pair of deer
antlers, the trophy symbolizing the fastest boat on the river. The
antlers are up for grabs each year during Derby Week.

   Some couples race to get to the altar. Carol
and Denny Bennett kept going.
   The pair got their marriage off to a running start Sunday as
nearly 1,800 competitors witnessed the wedding ceremony on the
starting line of the 12th annual River Corridor Classic half
marathon.
   The Bennetts, 41-year-old marathon enthusiasts from West
Carrollton, were wed in their running shorts minutes before
competing in the 13.1 mile race, in which Bennett finished 1,005th
and his wife 1,213th.
   The couple said they met on the finish line of a race in
Columbus two years ago and decided to have their wedding at the
race here so all their friends could attend.
   Although the best man and the maid of honor also are runners,
they opted for the traditional tuxedo and gown and did not run.
   ``Considering the fact that only 1 percent of the entire
population runs in marathons, I'd say we're pretty lucky to have
both a best man and a maid of honor who are marathoners,'' Bennett
said.
   The newlyweds said they plan to spend their honeymoon in Chicago
_ running in the Chicago Marathon.

   If, as Thomas Edison said, genius is 1 percent
inspiration and 99 percent perspiration, members of the Triple Nine
Society might have a hard time qualifying despite their soaring IQs.
   ``No jobs are appropriate for us,'' opined John Hart, 44, of
Phoenix. ``Any job in existence is designed for people at a lower
(intellectual) level, because there is no way they can count on
getting someone of our level.''
   About 30 members of the brainy brotherhood concluded their
fourth annual convention here last weekend with little fanfare _
and no agenda. The participants just sat and talked.
   The Triple Nine Society considers its international membership a
little more exclusive than Mensa, another ``genius'' society. To be
eligible for Triple Niner status, a person must have an IQ above
150, or higher than 99.9 percent of the population.
   Mensa, which is more widely known, is open to anyone whose IQ is
above only 98 percent of the population.
   Despite their intellectual certitude, Triple Niners weren't
quite sure whether they should rule out setting an agenda for
future conferences.
   ``It might be useful,'' Hart said.
   ``Then again,'' said Rita Beechey, 42, of Ontario, Canada, ``it
might not.''

<TEXT>
   The government appears to be on a
campaign to discredit the head of the Roman Catholic Church in
Nicaragua, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, over the church's use of
U.S. funds.
   But the main issue seems to be the government's determination,
now that it feels it has defeated the U.S.-backed rebels
militarily, to stop the flow of U.S. funds to groups opposed to or
not supportive of the leftist Sandinista regime.
   Conservative estimates by political opposition sources in the
capital Managua say more than $50,000 arrive from the United States
monthly. The Sandinistas argue that most of the money comes from
the Central Intelligence Agency even if it is distributed by labor,
church or other groups.
   On Saturday, President Daniel Ortega accused Obando y Bravo and
Nicaraguan bishops of becoming ``instruments of Ronald Reagan's
politics of death'' by accepting U.S. funds.
   At the center of the controversy with the Catholic Church is the
role of the cardinal as one of the two members of the Verification
Commission agreed upon by the Sandinista government and the rebels,
known as Contras.
   The duty of the commission is to confirm that the two sides are
following the peace accords tentatively approved earlier this year.
   The other commission member is Joao Baena Soares,
secretary-general of the Organization of American States, or OAS.
   The tentative peace accords specified that Verification
Commission would be under the control of Baena Soares. The OAS
would pay for expenses, but to speed things up the U.S. Agency for
1nternational Development agreed to provide the $10 million needed.
   Managua Curia spokesman Monsignor Bismark Carballo explained
that nearly $1 million of the funds would be used by the church to
acquire equipment and pay salaries of members of local verification
commissionss set up by the church in cease-fire areas.
   The issue came to light a few days ago when the
government-controlled news media accused Obando y Bravo of trying
to bring in, duty-free, 17 four-wheel vehicles and a similar number
of generators reportedly to be used by the local verification
commissions.
   Assistant Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco said there is
nothing the local commissions can verify since there was no
concrete agreement between the government and the Contras.
   ``What are they verifying?'' Tinoco asked last week, adding the
gpvernment does not recognize the cardinal as being in charge of
the Verification Commission.
   According to the original accords, the commission would verify
the movement of the Contras into safe cease-fire areas, withdrawal
of Sandinista troops and the eventual disarming of the rebels and
their return to civilian life.
   The talks broke down in June, with both sides announcing
unilateral cease-fires.
   The local verification commissions were to be made up of the
Catholic bishops in the cease-fire areas and people they appointed
as well as foreign representatives named by the OAS
secretary-general.
   Baena Soares has remained quiet during the controversy, and
currently the commissions have only those members named by the
church.
   Church officials say they feel the commissions are also charged
with verification of respect for human rights and
``democratization'' in the cease-fire areas.
   ``We know what they are doing,'' Tinoco said.
   Church officials acknowledge the commissions have gathered
information harmful to the government.
   Tinoco said any funds for the Verification Commission ``may be
suspended until the government and the commission reach an
agreement on the way the commissions will work.''
   Church officials said privately they feel the government may be
trying to force Obando y Bravo to step down as a member of the
Verification Commission.
   The cardinal angered the government Oct. 9 when he publicly
criticized it for rejecting humanitarian aid approved by the U.S.
Congress.

   Rioting broke out among hundreds of gate
crashers at an overcrowded soccer game that had been blacked out on
local television. One person was killed and 50 injured, police said.
   Police fired tear gas to disperse fans Sunday as they tried to
force their way into Cairo Stadium, which was already filled over
its 100,000 capacity for a match between the Al-Ahli and Tersana
teams, both of Cairo.
   Police said most of the fans who attempted to crash through the
gates were supporters of the Al-Ahli team, which is leading the
12-team national soccer league. Tersana is 5th in the standings.
   Despite the violence, the game was played and Al-Ahli won 3-1.
   Cairo television recently stopped broadcasting live reports of
most games after the owners of several soccer teams said the
programs were reducing their ticket sales.
   The state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram, in its report on Sunday's
violence, called on the government to order the televison network
to resume live broadcasts of the games.

<HEAD>Pledge Of Allegiance: Socialist Wrote It, Flag-selling Magazine
Published It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush has portrayed Boston as
a hotbed of left-wing intellectuals who don't respect rituals like
the Pledge of Allegiance. But scholars say the pledge was born here.
   What's more, the Baptist minister generally credited with
composing it was a socialist.
   ``Most people don't know anything about the history of the
pledge ... and if you tell them, they don't want to believe you,''
said Louise Harris of Providence, R.I., who has written two books
on the subject.
   The Pledge of Allegiance was surrounded by controversy and
hucksterism after it first appeared in a Boston magazine, The
Youth's Companion, on Sept. 8, 1892.
   The magazine had pioneered the sale of subscription
``premiums,'' such as school uniforms and silver tea services. But
it achieved its greatest commercial success, and its enduring
legacy, with a drive to put a flag in every school.
   The flags were priced at $3.30 to $13, depending on size. To
help schools raise the money, the magazine provided ``flag
certificates'' that pupils could sell for 10 cents apiece.
   The magazine urged schoolchildren to prepare to celebrate the
400th anniversary of Columbus' voyage to America the next month,
and even published a suggested ceremony, most involving a flag.
   Sandwiched between a presidential proclamation and an ode to
Columbus, both long forgotten, was the original pledge: ``I pledge
allegiance to my flag and to the republic for which it stands: one
nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.''
   At the words ``my flag,'' the students were instructed to
stretch out their right arms to the flag, similiar to the Nazi
salute.
   It was not until 1923 that the words ``my flag'' were replaced
by ``the flag of the United States of America'' out of concern that
immigrant children might think they were pledging allegiance to
their native lands.
   Thirty-one more years passed until ``under God'' was inserted at
the the behest of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who said that
``in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual
weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful resource
in peace and war.''
   The original version of the pledge was unsigned. But once it had
caught on, competing claims to authorship quickly emerged. One
group pushed for James B. Upham, an editor of The Youth's
Companion. The other favored the Rev. Francis Bellamy, who had
served as pastor of two Boston churches before joining the
magazine's staff.
   Harris and some other scholars say Upham was the author.
   But two formal investigations _ by the U.S. Flag Association in
1939 and by the Library of Congress in 1957 _ concluded Bellamy was
responsible.
   That is now the dominant view, even though Bellamy was a vice
president of the Society of Christian Socialists and once gave a
lecture entitled ``Jesus the Socialist.'' According to his
daughter-in-law, Rachel Bellamy of Rochester, N.Y., he left the
ministry ``because he felt the church wasn't doing enough to help
the working man.''
   ``The Nationalist Movement, which he belonged to, wanted to
nationalize chunks of the American economy but have them controlled
at the municipal level,'' said researcher David Whitman of
Washington, D.C. ``He did not practice or preach violent overthrow
of the government by any means.''
   Controversy over the pledge erupted during the 1988 presidential
elections when Bush criticized his Democratic rival, Gov. Michael
Dukakis, for vetoing a 1977 bill that would have mandated that
teachers lead the students in the Pledge the beginning of every
school day.
   That wasn't the first controversy surrounding the Pledge. In the
1940s, Jehovah's Witnesses objected to reciting it in schools,
saying it violated their religious principles of pronouncing
allegiance only to God.
   The U.S. Supreme Court initially rejected their arguments,
ruling in a 1940 case that public schools could expel children who
did not recite the pledge. Then, in 1943, the court reversed itself
and said children could not be compelled to pledge.
   Meantime, Jehovah's Witnesses had been the targets of attacks in
dozens of communities. In Richwood, Va., for example, members of
the sheriff's department and American Legion forced seven members
to drink large quantities of castor oil, then tied them together
and paraded them through town.
   ``Bellamy was an avid fan of saying the pledge,'' said Whitman,
``but I can't imagine how he would have felt about it if he had
lived to see the mob violence of the '40s.''

<HEAD>Extradition Hearings To Begin For Accused California Mass Murderer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man wanted in California for
allegedly carrying out a string of sex slayings won't be returning
to the United States soon even though he faces extradition
proceedings, his lawyer has predicted.
   Hearings will begin today to determine whether Charles Ng,
currently serving a 4{-year jail sentence here for armed robbery,
should be extradited to the United States.
   But Ng's Calgary-based lawyer, Don MacLeod, said it could be a
long time before his 27-year-old client heads south. If Ng loses
the case, there will likely be an appeal, he said.
   Ng was convicted in Canada in December 1985 after a botched
shoplifting attempt in Calgary in which a security guard was shot
in the hand.
   But the United States wants Ng back to face 25 felony counts in
Calfornia, including the murders of 12 people. Eleven of the deaths
involved grisly sex slayings at a rural cabin in Calaveras county,
120 miles east of San Francisco.
   The other murder case involves the death of a San Francisco disc
jockey, and other charges include burglary, kidnapping and false
imprisonment.
   Ng, a native of Hong Kong and a former marine, came to Canada
after his companion, Leonard Lake, was picked up for shoplifting in
San Francisco and committed suicide.
   Lake later was linked to the deaths or disappearances of 22
people. That investigation led to the charges against Ng.
   
   If extradited and convicted, Ng faces possible execution in
California.
   Canada has a policy against extraditing anyone facing the death
penalty, but the final decision will ultimately rest with Federal
Justice Minister Ray Hnatyshyn.
   The hearings, which are being held to determine if there is
enough evidence to send Ng back to the United States, are expected
to last up to five weeks.
   Not all evidence will be available to the public. Madame Justice
Marguerite Trussler of Alberta's Court of Queen's Bench ordered in
May that anything said in open court could be reported but the
courtroom would be cleared when certain sensitive material was
discussed.
   Among observers at the hearings will be some family members of
Ng's alleged victims, who were given financial aid by the
Edmonton-based Victims of Violence for their trip.
   Sharon Sellitto, whose 39-year-old brother Paul Cosner is one of
Ng's alleged victims, said she wanted to see the accused killer for
herself.
   ``I want to hate him in person,'' Sellitto said recently from
her San Francisco home. She plans to attend the hearings.
   Allegations of torture and mass murder in the California deaths
have caused many to question Canada's extradition procedure. As
recently as May, California Gov. George Deukmejian urged Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney to speed up the process.
   In a letter, Deukmejian said denying the extradition ``could
have the unfortunate consequence of making Canada a haven for death
penalty fugitives.''
   But Ng's Calgary-based lawyer, Don MacLeod, predicted it could
be a long time before Ng heads south. Regardless of the outcome of
the extradition hearings, he said, there will likely be an appeal.

   The average small investor has prospered since
last October's market debacle, continuing to reap gains on assets
not hurt by the crash, a magazine reported.
   During the past year, the average small investor's portfolio has
grown 12 percent to $77,031, Money magazine said in its current
issue. That's well above the 9.1 percent annual return that has
averaged since 1970.
   What cushioned small investors in the face of Black Monday was
the fact that more than 68 percent of their money was invested in
assets not directly affected by the plunge in stock prices.
   When Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 20.4 percent on
Oct. 19, 1987, the average small investor lost only 6.6 percent,
Money said. And while the S&P index was off about 22 percent in the
fourth quarter, the small investor's portfolio declined by just 4.9
percent before bouncing back this year.
   According to the magazine, money funds and certificates of
deposit represent 45.3 percent of the average portfolio, while
stocks make up about 28 percent. As stock prices fell, money funds
and CDs continued to yield 6 percent to 8 percent a year.
   In addition, bonds and bond funds, which make up 23.1 percent of
the average portfolio, rose in value as interest rates fell in the
fourth quarter.
   According to the magazine, the small investor benefited from the
steady performance of those assets as well as from rebounding stock
prices and equity funds.

<HEAD>Excerpts from Richard Burton's Diaries Published</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Burton wrote in his diary that he'd love
Elizabeth Taylor until he died, and recounted that he once bought
her a $1.1 million ring after he told her her hands were ``large
and ugly and red and masculine.''
   The late Welsh actor also wrote that he was ``as thrilled by the
English language as I am by a lovely woman or dreams.''
   In the journals, he analyzed his relationship with Taylor,
detailed the fairy-tale life they lived, and fretted about the
financial cost of diamonds and the physical cost of drinking.
   Excepts from a biography, which quotes from Burton's journals,
are published in November's Life magazine. The book, ``Richard
Burton: A Life 1925-1984,'' by Melvyn Bragg and Sally Burton, whom
Burton married in 1983, will be published by Little, Brown in
February.
   ``I have been inordinately lucky all my life, but the greatest
luck of all has been Elizabeth,'' Burton wrote on Nov. 19, 1967.
``She is a prospectus that can never be entirely catalogued, an
almanac for Poor Richard. And I'll love her till I die.''
   Burton lamented that he had insulted Taylor one night by telling
her that her hands were ``large and ugly and red and masculine.''
The next morning, Taylor replied that Burton would have to buy her
a diamond ring of 69 carats to make her hands less ugly. ``That
insult last night is going to cost me.'' Burton wrote. He ended up
spending $1.1 million for the ring.
   Burton worried about Taylor's drinking and his own. ``It would
be frightful to live the rest of our lives in an alcoholic haze,
seeing the world through fumes of spirits and smoke.''

<HEAD>Deng Says He Wrote Letter To Gorbachev Three Years Ago</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping said today he
wrote a letter to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev three years
ago and that the letter was now bearing fruit.
   Deng revealed at the beginning of a meeting with Romanian
President Nicolae Ceausescu that he had entrusted Ceausescu with
the letter, apparently calling for an improvement in Sino-Soviet
relations.
   ``You can see the letter you carried three years ago has
achieved results,'' Deng said to the Romanian president as they
posed for photographers. ``It's happening later than we thought,
but don't worry.''
   Deng also repeated his prediction, made in talks with Finnish
President Mauno Koivisto last week, that ``it is possible that next
year there could be a summit.''
   It would be the first summit between the two countries in 30
years.
   China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen is to travel to Moscow
later this year to discuss details of the first summit since Nikita
Khrushchev visited Beijing in 1959.
   The first foreign minister working-level talks since 1956 are
expected to focus on the Cambodian question, the last major
stumbling block to normalizing relations strained by an ideological
split in 1960.
   China has demanded that Moscow use its influence to force
Vietnam to withdraw its troops from Cambodia. The Soviet Union is
Vietnam's main financial backer and arms supplier.
   Ceausescu, who last met Deng in October 1985, said it ``doesn't
matter'' that the rapprochement process between Moscow and Beijing
has been slow. ``History is long and the route we are taking is
long.''
   China has insisted that Deng, and not the Soviets, first
suggested the holding of a summit, although Gorbachev has grabbed
the initiative in recent years by saying he was ready to meet
Chinese leaders without any pre-conditions.
   Ceausescu told Deng he had visited Moscow the previous week
``and now I convey greetings to you from Gorbachev.''
   Deng replied, ``you can also convey my greetings to Gorbachev.''
   Romania's position as a independent maverick among the Warsaw
Pact has contributed to Ceausescu's acting as an intermediary
between disputing nations. Romania was the only Soviet-bloc country
to maintain normal political and party-to-party ties with China
after the split between Moscow and Beijing.
   He is currently making his sixth visit to China.

<TEXT>
   The McMartin Pre-School molestation case was
billed as the nation's largest when it was launched five years ago
with seven defendants and 41 alleged young victims.
   Now, the shrunken case is remarkable for its longevity and the
bitterness it has left among those who have been touched by it.
   The only remaining defendants are Raymond Buckey, 30, and his
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 61, who taught at the now defunct
Manhattan Beach preschool founded by Mrs. Buckey's mother, Virginia
McMartin.
   The Buckeys face 65 charges of molestation and conspiracy, down
from an original 115 counts. The alleged victims have dwindled to
11.
   The trial has consumed 1{ years and won't end for months. The
defense, which has called Buckey ``an American hero'' victimized by
the news media and claimed children were coached into alleging
molestation, begins presenting its case this week. The trial
followed a preliminary hearing that lasted nearly two years.
   ``The case has poisoned everyone who had contact with it,''
Superior Court Judge William Pounders declared last week.
   ``By that I mean every witness, every litigant and every
judicial officer. It's a very upsetting case.''
   Two witnesses have died, one by suicide, the other from an
alcohol-related disease. Pounders has attributed both deaths to
pressures of the case.
   ``We never envisioned that it would last this long,'' said
Robert Philibosian, the former Los Angeles district attorney who
filed the case.
   ``It's absolutely a travesty of justice for the children and
parents that the case would last this long.''
   He blames a California law giving a defendant the right to a
post-indictment preliminary hearing and a municipal court judge
who, he said, didn't limit that pretrial proceeding.
   Philibosian also criticizes his successor, District Attorney Ira
Reiner, for waiting until the end of the preliminary hearing in
1986 to dismiss charges against five former teachers.
   Reiner, who had said evidence against the five was ``incredibly
weak,'' has declined to discuss the case until the trial is over.
   The chief prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin, says
the trial has been worth the effort and its $10.5 million cost. She
said the testimony of nine children who took the stand and medical
evidence showing ``significant genital scarring'' in seven of those
children helped her case.
   ``I can think of many other things I might rather have done over
the last 4{ years. But you have to have a more global perspective.
If nothing else, the public is now more aware that these kinds of
things have occurred and unfortunately continue to occur,'' she
said.
   Buckey's attorney, Danny Davis, says his client is ``an American
hero'' who has endured a media blitz that declared him guilty.
   ``The case was lost when I was hired,'' said Davis. ``If I read
the newspapers and didn't know Ray Buckey, wouldn't I have thought
he was guilty?''
   Buckey, who was 25 at his arrest, has been held without bail and
marked his 30th birthday in jail. His mother, free on bail, reports
to court every day, usually clutching her knitting and a Bible.
   The children's allegations included teachers touching their
genitals, urinating on them and forcing them to have sex with
animals. Rabbits were mutiliated to scare the youngsters into
remaining silent, the children said.
   The defense, which has contended that the children were coached
or coerced by a social worker or their parents to allege
molestation, has managed to whittle down the case.
   Last week, the judge agreed to a prosecution request to drop 27
charges based on claims of abuse by three alleged victims who
failed to testify. The prosecution claimed they were too
traumatized to appear in court: the defense said they were
deliberately excluded because their planned testimony lacked
credibility.
   Davis expresses confidence his client will be cleared.
   ``The message for Ray Buckey is big men come out of big
mistakes, and this (case) is a big mistake,'' he said.

   Small planes are flying tons of food to
thousands of starving civil war refugees, but relief officials say
fighting and flooding will keep help from reaching hundreds of
thousands in remote areas.
   Twin-engine Cessnas on Sunday flew some of the 90 tons of food
to about 40,000 people jammed into Abyei, 500 miles southwest of
the capital, Khartoum. The $1 million U.S.-financed airlift began
Thursday and is to last 10 days.
   Brian Wannop, a representative of the U.N. Development Program
in Khartoum, said officials visiting Abyei in the past few days
said the emaciated southerners were too weak to prevent scavenging
hyenas from dragging away the bodies of relatives at night.
   The refugees left behind their crops and cattle to escape a
civil war between the government and the Sudan People's Liberation
Army, fighting for economic and political reform since 1983 and
claiming to control 90 percent of the southern countryside.
   The group, demanding autonomy for the Christian and animist
African south from the Moslem-dominated government in the north,
has shot down relief planes because they say the flights may be
military-related. Abyei is just beyond the reach of the fighting.
   Western relief officials say the airlift to Abyei is tiny
compared to the extent of devastation facing hundreds of thousands
of others in less accessible areas.
   Wannop said that in the past five years of the civil war, about
2 million southerners fled their homes to camps and shantytowns in
southeastern Ethiopia, central and western Sudan and around the
capital of Khartoum. He said 150,000 people fled to the western
region of Darfur and south Kordofan, where Abyei is located.
   A Western relief official said it would take two to three weeks
before the impact of the supply mission could be felt. The
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said eight to 10
people, weakened by malnutrition, lack of medical treatment and a
long trek to refugee camps, were dying every day.
   An estimated 80 people a day died in the area's refugee camps in
July and August, the worst months in a summer that some relief
officials say took up to 10,000 lives. They said most were the
elderly or young children.
   Wannop said a possible explanation for the lower death rate was
that all the younger children had already died during the difficult
summer months.
   The Sudanese Red Crescent says Abyei's population of 10,000 has
swelled to 40,000 by displaced people.
   Sudanese officials say the Western agencies are exaggerating the
number of refugees throughout the south and that the government has
drawn up a plan to supply relief to about 224,000 people.
   ``The people affected by the famine and starvation are moving
northward,'' said Haj Tayeb, Sudan's acting commissioner for relief
and rehabilitation. ``We reached some of them and gave them aid.''
   The government earlier expelled several Western relief agencies
for allegedly working with the rebels to get supplies to stranded
southerners.
   Heavy rains and floods in August have exacerbated conditions for
the southerners and hampered efforts by Sudanese and foreign relief
agencies to help them.
   Relief food and medicines last reached Abyei in June, before
Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's government halted relief operations
during the rainy season, when the guerrilla war intensified.
   Rebel gunners shot down two relief planes in 1986 and 1987,
killing more than 70 people.

<TEXT>
   An art dealer imprisoned for tax evasion was
cleared of charges that he humiliated and tortured a teacher for
six hours during a sado-masochistic homosexual encounter.
   The state jury acquitted Andrew Crispo of kidnapping, sodomy,
assault and coercion because members believed the teacher had
agreed to the ordeal, said juror Ara Derderian.
   The jury, which reached its verdict on the sixth day of
deliberations Sunday, deadlocked on a charge of unlawful
imprisonment. The district attorney's office was considering
dropping the charge.
   Crispo, 43, had denied the charges by Mark Leslie, a 28-year-old
college English teacher from Montreal who said Crispo and four
young men imprisoned and brutalized him in Crispo's Manhattan
gallery on Sept. 20, 1984.
   Defense lawyer Robert Kasanof called the verdict ``protection
for everybody's liberty.''
   He noted that Leslie met Crispo admitted he liked getting hit
and feeling ``a little pain'' during sex and paid the check when he
went out to dinner with Crispo after the encounter.
   Assistant District Attorney Joel Seidemann, who described Crispo
during the trial as ``a master manipulator'' who ``deals art by day
and torture by night,'' said simply, ``The jury has spoken.''
   Leslie, who fled to Vancouver, British Columbia, after Montreal
newspapers published his name, address and photograph, denounced
the verdict in a statement.
   ``My purpose in bringing this charge was to prevent Andrew
Crispo from beating, torturing or killing other young men,'' the
statement said. ``Justice (Jeffrey) Atlas' rulings throughout the
trial and the subtle bias of his charge to the jury make a
profoundly disturbing statement. In our society it is acceptable to
brutalize and even murder gay men.''
   Leslie testified at the trial but was not present for Atlas'
instructions to the jury.
   He had testified that he had two sadomasochistic encounters with
Crispo and snorted cocaine with him. At the second encounter,
Leslie said, he was attacked at the gallery against his wishes and
left bleeding, crying and handcuffed. He said he expected some
rough sex but did not consent to being tortured.
   ``Leslie did not protect himself by saying there's a limit to
what I'm willing to do,'' said Derderian, a 60-year-old architect
who was the only juror to talk to reporters after the verdict.
``There was a mistaken idea of what each side meant by domination.''
   A key prosecution witness was Bernard LeGeros, 26, who pleaded
guilty to attempted kidnapping in exchange for his testimony
against Crispo.
   LeGeros is serving 25 years to life for the sadomasochistic
murder in February 1985 of Eigil Dag Vesti, 26, a Norwegian fashion
student and model. Crispo was implicated but never charged in
Vesti's death.
   Vesti's body was found on the estate of LeGeros' parents. After
seeing news naming LeGeros and Crispo, Leslie went to the police.
   Crispo has served 2{ years of a five-year federal prison
sentence for tax evasion and is eligible for parole, according to
his attorney Mary Shannon.

   Gangs of youths surged through the city's
popular South Street area following an anti-drug rap concert,
robbing and beating people, said police, who arrested 13.
   A firefighter trying to help a woman attacked by a gang suffered
a broken nose, said Detective William Brennan. He said a youth was
arrested for the beating, which occurred Saturday afternoon.
   About three hours later, a gang beat and robbed another woman
then got away, Brennan said.
   Shortly afterward, a gang broke a store window and removed
jackets and other clothing. The youths were chased by witnesses,
and police arrested eight suspects, Brennan said.
   A short time later, four people were arrested on charges of
beating and robbing a man eight blocks from the store, Brennan said.
   Brennan said police did not have an estimate of the number of
youths involved in the attacks, but several small groups had roamed
the area.

   The dollar opened sharply lower against the
Japanese yen today but recovered some of the loss before closing
time, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange eased slightly.
   The dollar closed at 127.20 yen, 1.05 yen lower than its close
Friday. It began trading today at 126.30 and moved in a wide range
of 126.25 and 127.50 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed 37.83
points lower at 27,268.74. The 0.14 percent drop erased the
Nikkei's morning gain of 53.72 points in thin, directionless
trading. Volume on the main first section was a light 400 million
shares.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's partial recovery to the
market's wariness about the speed of its recent decline. Following
setbacks on world markets last week, the U.S. currency opened today
at 126.30 yen, its lowest starting level since the 125.84 yen
opening recorded June 20.
   ``The dollar was bought back at a considerable amount by
Japanese investors,'' said Shinya Hirota of the Bank of Tokyo.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei seesawed in a narrow range
amid lackluster trading. Dealers said a lack of incentives was
keeping market players on the sidelines.

   Men who found themselves barred from staying at
their girlfriends' housing project homes because of a curfew on
visitors say they may have to get married to beat the ban.
   The Chicago Housing Authority instituted the ban last month and
employed guards around the clock at the Rockwell Gardens
development to reclaim the building from marauding gang members.
   Residents who are on the lease must show housing authority
identity cards to enter and leave the 138-unit building on
Chicago's West Side. Visitors must leave by midnight, and that
includes men who live with their girlfriends.
   When the ban went into effect in September, Patrick Page boarded
himself up in his girlfriend's apartment and has refused to answer
the door.
   ``It's been like a prison,'' said Page, who has not left the
building since Sept. 20. ``The only difference is, they don't bring
your food up.''
   Like a few other men in the building, Page said the eviction of
non-leaseholders has accelerated his plans to marry the woman he's
been living with for three years.
   ``We had a serious talk and decided to get married,'' said Page,
24, whose girlfriend is pregnant with their second child.
   Greg Johnson, 24, also has been hiding in his girlfriend's
apartment since the Sept. 20 crackdown. He's still pondering what
to do: get married, stay in hiding or leave and run the risk of
being homeless.
   ``Hopefully, these guys who are hiding and ducking and dodging
may be able to step forward and be men,'' said Vincent Lane,
chairman of the housing authority.

<HEAD>US-Pakistani Report Blames Sabotage Or Other Crime In Crash That
Killed Zia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The plane crash that killed President
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, the U.S. ambassador and 28 others was not an
accident, according to a U.S.-Pakistani report. But officials said
the exact cause may never be known.
   Pakistan air force Cmdr. Abbas Mirza, who released a summary of
the report Sunday, said the Aug. 17 crash of the Hercules C-130
transport plane may have been caused by a small explosion or the
pilots may have been drugged or intentionally crashed the plane.
   But the lack of a black box voice recorder and the inability to
perform autopsies on the bodies of the pilots is hampering
investigators from concluding just what caused the plane to go
down, he said.
   The 365-page report ruled out mechanical failure, said Mirza,
who gave a 27-page summary to reporters at a hastily called news
conference.
   ``After a thorough analysis of the available evidence, the board
has been unable to substantiate a technical reason for the
accident,'' said the report by four Pakistani investigators and six
U.S. Air Force officers.
   ``In the absence of the technical reason, the only other
possible cause of the accident is the occurrence of a criminal act
or sabotage leading to the loss of aircraft control and the
(crash),'' it said.
   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck said
U.S. officials received a copy of the report and ``we are studying
it.'' She made no further comment.
   All 30 people aboard the plane were killed, including U.S.
Ambassador Arnold Raphel; a U.S. defense adviser, Brig. Gen.
Herbert M. Wassom; and five top Pakistani generals.
   Mirza said eyewitness reports and a test of debris ruled out the
possibility the plane was hit by a surface-to-air missile or
suffered a powerful mid-air explosion. But he said a smaller
explosion remained a possibility.
   He said witnesses reported the aircraft pitched violently for
about two minutes before making a nosedive.
   Mirza also said lab tests of the debris showed unusually large
quantities of chemicals used to make explosives, including
phosphorus, chlorine, potassium, antimony and pentaerythritol
tetranitrate.
   He said investigators assembled a detonator from the same
chemicals found in the debris.
   The report noted phosphorus was found on mango seeds in the
wreckage. Earlier reports speculated an explosive device was hidden
in a box of mangos offered as a gift and placed aboard at the last
minute. Mirza did not comment on the theory.
   Among the scenarios Mirza suggested were that the flight crew
was drugged, causing them to lose control. But he said that due to
the condition of the bodies no autopsies could be performed to test
that theory.
   The drugs could have been hidden in a gift package or beverage
cans, Mirza said.
   Mirza said the phrase ``criminal act'' referred to the
possibility that the pilot or co-pilot could have disrupted cockpit
controls intentionally, causing the crash in an open field.
   Because there was no voice recorder aboard the aircraft, he
said, it was impossible to determine what the crew said before the
crash.
   The plane originated in Islamabad and flew to Bahawalpur, where
Zia watched a demonstration of the U.S. M-1 Abrams battle tank. The
four-engine turboprop crashed after takeoff on the return flight
from Bahawalpur, 330 miles south of Islamabad.
   Zia, 64, was a military strongman who imposed eight years of
martial law during his 11 years in power.
   The Soviet Union and Afghanistan objected to his support of
rebels fighting Afghanistan's Marxist government.
   India fought three wars with Pakistan since the subcontinent was
partitioned in 1947.

   A current trade fair in Canton features
bullet-proof vests, anti-riot helmets and shields, electric shock
batons and other equipment for use by China's newly formed riot
police force, an official daily said today.
   The China Daily said the China Jingan Equipment Import and
Export Corporation is also displaying tear gas bombs, dye bombs,
submachine guns and anti-riot guns.
   It quoted an official of the corporation, the only Chinese firm
authorized to deal in police equipment in China, as saying more
than 1,000 sets of anti-riot helmets and shields have already been
supplied to police in Henan, Liaoning and Tibet provinces.
   Tibet is troubled by a small independence movement and tension
between Chinese and the local Tibetans, while there have been
reports of labor unrest in Liaoning, northeast China.
   The creation of the riot police force coincides with what
Chinese security officials acknowledge is a rising problem with
crime and social unrest resulting from the state's gradual
loosening of political and economic controls.
   In the past few years there have been riots in Tibet, student
demonstrations calling for greater democracy, labor strikes and
protests by farmers about pollution.
   Jingan official Yin Guishan said the cost of providing a riot
police officer with a full range of equipment would be about $1,350.
   He said the company is also designing China's first armored
police personnel carrier, a $81,000 vehicle carrying 10 people and
equipped with surveillance instruments and weapons.

<HEAD>Dozens Evacuated in Washington State Flooding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SULTAN, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unseasonably heavy rains flooded much of
western Washington, forced about 45 people to be evacuated from
homes and campgrounds, and stranded two hikers shivering under a
tree for a night.
   ``We had just about lost hope. We thought we were going to die
out there,'' said Steve Winsel, 28, of Fairfield, Calif., who was
hiking with his 30-year-old brother, Mike, of Everett.
   Rain tapered off and floodwaters were receding late Sunday in
the Cascade Mountains foothills east of Seattle, but more rain was
predicted for tonight and early Tuesday with the approach of
another storm system, the National Weather Service said.
   The Winsels were trapped in the Vesper Peak area about 20 miles
south of Sultan, a town of 1,500 residents 30 miles northeast of
Seattle. The brothers were dressed in boots and jackets and had
some food, but said it was icy cold and only one of them had gloves.
   ``We were awake all night shivering,'' Steve Winsel said. ``In
the morning, we tried to return on the logging road, but we found
the (Skykomish) river had risen overnight and had wiped out the
road in three places.''
   The only bridge they found was impassable, so the brothers had
to swim across the river, where they were picked up by a truck
driver and taken back to Sultan.
   ``We probably wouldn't have been able to survive if we'd have
stayed outdoors another night,'' Steve Winsel said.
   ``We'd already spent 24 hours in hell.''
   The Skykomish crested in Sultan on Sunday three feet above flood
stage, Fire Chief Roger Knowlton said.
   About 15 residents had to be evacuated by boat from the town
Sunday morning, according to Karl Christian, a dispatch supervisor
for the Snohomish County sheriff's office. Residents were allowed
to return home Sunday night.
   Red Cross volunteers fed 30 people and arranged for emergency
housing after evacuating them from trailers in the Snoqualmie River
Campground on Sunday, said relief worker Hope Tuttle. The contents
of two or three trailers were believed destroyed, she said.
   The Skagit and Stillaguamish rivers also reached flood stage at
upper elevations Sunday, the weather service reported. A flood
warning for the Nooksack River was canceled late Sunday.
   The floodwaters closed numerous roads throughout the Cascade
foothills. No damage estimate was immediately available.
   Heavy rain washed enough logging debris down the Skagit River to
cause a partial dam to form at a Burlington Northern railroad
bridge, but no major problems were anticipated, said Tom Sheahan,
management director of the Skagit County Department of Emergency
Services.
   During the 48 hours ending at 5 p.m. Sunday, the weather service
reported 1.64 inches of rain in Bellingham, 1.39 in Olympia, 1.04
at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport _ and 6.25 at Stampede
Pass, just south of Snoqualmie Pass and about 50 miles
south-southeast of Seattle.

   Thunderstorms that lashed the nation's midsection and the
Sunbelt with hail and high winds weakened early today, while
unseasonably heavy rains in Washington state caused flooding that
forced dozens of evacuations.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms extended across western Lake
Erie and northwestern Ohio into central Indiana early this morning,
but there were no reports of severe weather since dime-size hail
pelted northeastern Indiana on Sunday.
   In western Washington, another storm system was expected to
bring rain tonight and early Tuesday. Flooding on Sunday prompted
the evacuation of about 45 people from homes in Snohomish County
and a campground in King County.
   No damage estimates were immediately available while the waters
of the Snoqualmie, Skykomish, Skagit and Stillaguamish rivers were
still receding late Sunday.
   In Arizona, a series of thunderstorms abated today after
producing one-inch hail along with high winds, knocking down trees
and power lines in the town of Bisbee on Sunday. The storms also
produced local flooding.
   Showers were scattered from northern Idaho across southern South
Dakota into northwestern Illinois early this morning. Other showers
continued over North Dakota and the Tennessee Valley.
   Dense fog developed in Rhode Island and along the coast of
southern California. Generally fair skies prevailed across the rest
of the nation.
   Today's forecast called for rainshowers from the upper
Mississippi Valley through the Great Lakes region; scattered
showers and thunderstorms over the Ohio Valley, the middle
Mississippi Valley, eastern Oklahoma, the lower Great Lakes and the
central and northern Appalachians; and cloudy skies with widely
scattered showers over parts of the Pacific Northwest.
   High temperatures were expected in the 40s over eastern North
Dakota and northern Minnesota; the 50s from northern Washington
State through the northern Rockies and northern Plains into upper
Michigan, and in northern Maine; the 80s across the central and
southern Pacific Coast through the southern Rockies, the southern
Plains and the Gulf Coast states into Florida; the 90s over the
northern California valleys, inland southern California and the
Southwest desert southwest; and the 60s and 70s across the rest of
the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 35
degrees at Hibbing, Minn., to 78 degrees at Phoenix.

<HEAD>Researchers Test Anti-Clotting Agent in Dead Man</HEAD>

   Doctors said they kept a dead man's heart
beating for an hour in a successful test of a drug designed to
prevent blood clots, but an ethicist is questioning the
experiment's technique.
   ``It raises such fundamental issues that it needs to be explored
before you can call it right or wrong,'' said ethicist and
physician Dr. John La Puma of Lutheran General Hospital, Park
Ridge, Ill. La Puma's editorial accompanies the medical report in
the current issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine, published in
Philadelphia.
   Researchers at the State University of New York at Stony Brook
and Centocor, a Malvern-based pharmaceutical company, said the test
successfully prevented the man's blood from clotting during the
hour-long experiment.
   The drug, called 7E3, also did not cause excessive bleeding, one
possible side effect of two commonly used anti-clotting drugs,
heparin and warfarin.
   Researchers used a portion of a single-cell antibody to block
the clotting. Such antibodies are often called a ``magic bullet'
because they seek out a specific cell.
   Blood clots can cause strokes or heart attacks, such as when
they travel to the brain or pulmonary arteries.
   The experiment was conducted on a 78-year-old man at the Stony
Brook hospital by researchers led by Barry Coller, a hematologist
at the university on New York's Long Island.
   Relatives of the man, who had been in a coma from a brain
hemorrhage, and the hospital's Institutional Review Board gave
permission for the test. The man had been placed on a respirator so
that his heart would continue beating during the experiment.
   The article did not say when the experiment was conducted.
   ``The advent of a specific treatment such as the antibody,
without causing side effects, would be a very welcome and important
addition to available therapies,'' Dr. Hamid Al-Mondhiry, a
hematologist at the Penn State Milton S. Hersey Medical Center and
a researcher in anti-clotting agents, said in a telephone interview.
   In his editorial, La Puma wrote that the experiment was
``ethically questionable,'' and added that the report did not
outline details regarding informed consent that he considers
essential. He noted the researchers received consent from the
hospital and were not the ones to contact the patient's physician
to ask for consent.
   The newly dead should be considered for such experiments only
when the work is of value to physicians treating patients, rather
than basic biological research, said La Puma.
   La Puma said he found three reported instances of scientists
experimenting on newly dead patients this century.
   Coller said using a newly dead patient allowed the investigators
to study the effects of several doses of the treatment. Using live
volunteers would have increased the time necessary to complete the
study, he said.
   ``In our setting, the experiment provided us important
information that was potentially useful in benefiting humans,
without exposing a living human to harm,'' Coller said in a
statement.
   The experiment will also provide data for prospective volunteers
in clinical studies, the article said.
   Coller said the patient's physician notified the researchers
that the patient could be eligible for the study.
   Coller said nine years of prior research at Stony Brook,
Massachusetts General Hospital and the University of Wisconsin had
shown that the agent 7E3 prevented blood from clotting in test
tubes, monkeys and dogs, and models designed to simulate impending
strokes and heart attacks in humans.

<HEAD>Pro-Government Press Hails Botha's Trip As Breakthrough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pro-government newspapers
today hailed President P.W. Botha's trip to Europe and the Ivory
Coast as a rousing success although no agreements were announced
and Botha declined to divulge details.
   Botha returned Sunday following a 10-day trip, the latest in a
series of foreign journeys aimed at easing the country's diplomatic
isolation.
   Botha attended the funeral of Bavarian governor Franz Josef
Strauss in West Germany, then went to Switzerland where he met with
bankers and businessmen.
   En route back to South Africa, Botha stopped briefly Saturday in
Portugal and the Ivory Coast. In Portugal, Botha met with Prime
Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, and in the Ivory Coast with President
Felix Houphouet-Boigny.
   According to the French news agency Agence France-Presse, Botha
made a brief statement in the Ivory Coast, saying his conversations
with Houphouet covered African problems in general and southern
Africa in particular, but he did not elaborate.
   ``It is always a privilege to meet him,'' Botha said of
Houphouet according to the AFP report. ``We didn't want to pass by
without stopping in this country of goodwill.''
   None of the officials who met Botha have issued public
statements regarding the talks.
   The Ivory Coast stopover marked Botha's fourth visit to a
black-ruled African country since mid-September. Botha declined to
discuss the specifics of his talks with Houphouet-Boigny, one of
Africa's longest-serving leaders.
   ``We discussed matters concerning Africa and especially southern
Africa. We decided not to make statements,'' Botha said.
   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, said Botha's recent
travels have focused world attention onto South Africa.
   ``At a time when one might have expected the world to
demonstrate an obsession with the American presidential election,
the spotlight has instead been turned on South Africa,'' the
newspaper said today in an editorial.
   The Afrikaans-language daily Beeld said: ``What clearly began as
a visit to pay homage to a dead friend (Strauss) turned into a
noteworthy trip. ... Perhaps these moves could be followed up by
one or two dramatic developments internally that will show the
world that we are earnest about reform.''
   The newspaper suggested the government could release jailed
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and scrap pending
legislation designed to strengthen the Group Areas Act, which
segregates neighborhoods by race.
   The government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said Botha's
travels herald a ``fundamental change'' in South Africa's
relationship with the rest of the continent.
   ``By the end of last week even the most hardened cynics were
having to concede that a new spirit of conciliation was abroad,''
the SABC said.
   Botha, who has held power since 1978, never held a summit
meeting in a black-ruled African nation until he traveled to
Mozambique last month. He also has visited Malawi and Zaire in
recent weeks.
   South Africa says Presidents Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique and
Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire are likely to visit South Africa in
coming months.
   The Citizen, quoting unidentified government officials, said
there was a ``possibility'' that Botha would meet with Angolan
President Eduardo dos Santos.
   South Africa in August withdrew its troops from Angola, where
they fought alongside the anti-Marxist UNITA rebels.
   South Africa and Angola, along with Cuba and U.S. mediators,
have been attempting to negotiate an agreement on the withdrawal of
50,000 Cuban troops supporting the Angolan government and
independence for South-West Africa, the territory ruled by South
Africa.

<TEXT>
   Foreigners captured after entering
Afghanistan with Moslem guerrillas have been caught up in the Kabul
government's effort to win international credibility.
   As the Soviet Union's troops withdraw after nine years of
helping the Afghan government fight the guerrillas, the quest for
peace is increasingly pursued on the political front as well as the
military one.
   Winning recognition as a legitimate government is a key part of
the political campaign. Two Turks who joined the Afghan guerrillas
and a West German doctor and nurse who were working in a
guerrilla-controlled area are the latest pawns in this game _ all
four are being held in Kabul's Pol-e-Charki Prison.
   Most Western nations have refused to recognize or deal with the
Afghan government since Moscow's 1979 intervention that sent more
than 100,000 Red Army troops into Afghanistan to bolster the
Soviet-style regime.
   Afghan officials have made it clear the Turks' prison terms
could be shortened if President Turgut Ozal of Turkey appeals to
President Najib for clemency, according to a diplomatic source who
spoke on condition of anonymity. The Turkish government has refused
to do so on the grounds that humanitarian issues should not be
mixed with politics.
   Appeals addressed to Najib by President Francois Mitterrand of
France and President Francesco Cossiga of Italy resulted in the
freedom of a French journalist and an Italian photojournalist 4{
months ago. The two men had been convicted of espionage and of
entering Afghanistan illegally.
   France and Italy were criticized by some of their Western allies
on the grounds the appeals constituted de facto recognition of the
Afghan government.
   The Turkish and West German prisoners were accused of entering
Afghanistan illegally from Pakistan. They four have been visited in
prison by representatives of their governments.
   One of the Turks, Turgut Uzel, 22, was captured in 1984 and is
serving a 16-year sentence. The other, Osman Demir, 24, was
captured in December 1987 and is serving a 20-year term. Both were
convicted of illegal entry and espionage.
   West German doctor Benno Splieth and nurse Lea Hackstedt were
captured Sept. 8 and accused of illegal entry. Afghan news reports
also said they were spying. They have not been tried.
   A Western diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said there has been no suggestion that an appeal for clemency would
hasten the Germans' release. But he noted that West German
diplomats have been allowed to visit Splieth and Ms. Hackstedt
twice since their capture _ on Sept. 25 and on Sunday.
   The speed with which the visits were arranged was several months
faster than those accorded foreign prisoners in the past and appear
to be part of the Afghan government's move to present a more
humanitarian face to the world.
   Similarly, the International Committee of the Red Cross this
year has been allowed to visit Afghan political prisoners for the
first time in the war.
   France, Italy, West Germay and Turkey _ along with the United
States, most other Western nations and some non-Western ones _
withdrew their ambassadors in protest of the Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan. Their embassies in Kabul are headed by charge
d'affaires.
   Their contacts with the Afghan government are kept at a minimum.
They consist primarily of meetings with Foreign Ministry officials
over visa and other consular matters and with security forces over
safety measures for embassy grounds and staffers.
   The two West German prisoners and one of the Turks are in good
health, according to the diplomat sources. The other Turk, Demir,
appeared to be emotionally disturbed, one source said. The sources
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Turks were last visited by a representative of their
government Oct. 6. The diplomat familiar with their situation
described them as ``adventurers'' and said the espionage charges
were unfounded.
   He said Uzel was accused of spying for the CIA, while Demir was
accused of being a West German agent. He said Uzel previously went
to Iran to fight Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic regime. Uzel
was captured by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards but escaped and
soon joined the Afghan guerrillas.
   Uzel was captured in Jawzjan province which borders the Soviet
Union, while Demir was captured in Kandahar province which borders
Pakistan.
   Splieth, who is in his early 30s, and Ms. Hackstedt, who is in
her late 20s, were working with a West German private relief
organization called Committee Cap Anamur, according to the Western
diplomatic source.
   They were captured near Ghazni while returning to Pakistan after
working at a dispensary in Bamyan province west of Kabul.

<HEAD>Alcohol, Warm Weather and Party Atmosphere Blamed For Rioting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. CLOUD, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warm weather, the party atmosphere
surrounding homecoming weekend and increased alcohol consumption
have been blamed for two nights of rioting at St. Cloud State
University.
   ``The catalyst for this whole thing was a lot of young people
with a lot of booze in them,'' Assistant Police Chief Jim Moline
said Sunday. ``They're not experienced enough with alcohol and they
just go kind of crazy.''
   Things were quiet Sunday night, authorities said.
   But the previous night, police clad in riot gear clashed with
students and others who burned furniture and a trash bin that had
been dragged into the street. Sixty people were arrested, including
34 students, police said. On Friday night, two people were arrested.
   At least six people, including a police officer, were treated at
a hospital for minor injuries suffered Saturday night and early
Sunday, said hospital nursing supervisor Patricia Anderson.
   Students set off firecrackers and some played the Beatles' song
``Revolution'' on a stereo as police swept through the crowd,
estimated at about 700 people, Saturday night. Other people tore
down street signs and jumped on cars, or threw beer bottles and
pieces of lumber.
   In all, as many as 1,500 people converged on a four-block area
both Friday and Saturday nights, Moline said.
   Brendan McDonald, president of the 16,500-student campus, and
several students said numerous out-of-towners came to St. Cloud to
look for parties after Friday night's disturbance.
   ``Once it hit the news media, it was like an open invitation,''
McDonald said. ``Some people will go any distance for a party.''
   While authorities blamed the violence on the rioters, some
students said police aggravated the situation by using excessive
force.
   ``Both sides took it too far,'' said student Kevin Stanek.
   But Moline praised officers for their handling of the
disturbance. ``In situations like this, people have a tendency to
say things that look to the public like they (police) are
insensitive,'' he said.
   Moline said that in his 31 years on the city police force, the
weekend's violence could be topped only by demonstrations against
the Vietnam War in the 1960s.
   The two people arrested Friday night probably will be charged
with felony assault for throwing beer bottles, Moline said. Those
arrested Saturday are likely to be charged with misdemeanors, he
said.
   McDonald met with school officials Sunday to discuss the riots,
and university spokesman Angelo Gentile said a task force would be
appointed to investigate. University fraternities and sororities
sponsored a cleanup rally Sunday afternoon.
   Gentile said the university has no jurisdiction over private
rooming houses near campus that were the source of some of the
trouble.

   The Communist Party chief said today
the party must adopt far-reaching economic, constitutional and
political reforms to alleviate poverty and calm ethnic and social
unrest.
   ``We need a fundamental renewal of socialism which will throw
out everything that is bad and outdated and replace it with new
ways,'' Stipe Suvar said in an opening speech to a meeting of the
party's policy-setting Central Committee.
   The meeting of the Central Committee has been billed as a
historic session to approve the most sweeping personnel changes in
the four decades since the party came to power.
   ``The renewal of socialism means taking off its old,
tight-fitting suit and letting people breathe in new
surroundings,'' Suvar told the 162 members of the committee.
   ``All of us in this country are faced with a choice _ either we
all resolve the crisis together, or we all head to destruction,''
he said in the 70-page speech reported by the state news agency
Tanjug and excerpted on state-run radio and television.
   Suvar called for expanded private ownership, increased foreign
investment and the shutdown of unprofitable state enterprises. He
warned of possible layoffs but promised basic welfare for the
unemployed.
   He said unspecified leading jobs should be opened up to
non-party members but made clear the ruling League of Communists
has no intention of abandoning one-party rule.
   Alluding to widespread calls for personnel changes, he added,
``All the incompetent and compromised people must go and the
society must be ensured of a perspective.''
   Personnel reform was high on the agenda at the meeting.
   The expected changes come as Yugoslavia experiences its worst
economic and social crisis in 43 years of communist rule. Amid
growing ethnic and social unrest, living standards have fallen by
one-half since 1980, and austerity measures adopted in May have
slashed salaries as prices rise. Inflation is at 217 percent and
the foreign debt stands at $21 billion.
   Striking workers have taken to the streets in increasing
numbers, prompting alarmed officials to seek permission from the
International Monetary Fund to relax the austerity program.
   Fourteen of the 23 members of the Communist party's ruling
Politburo could be up for replacement at the meeting, including
four senior leaders whose recent resignations will have to be
formally accepted at the meeting.
   The four are former heads of the party, Bosko Krunic and Milanko
Renovica, a leading Communist from liberal northern Slovenia, Franc
Setinc, and a senior ethnic Albanian from the troubled province of
Kosovo, Kolj Siroka.
   Despite wide-spread calls from the Yugoslav public for the
session to be televised and broadcasted live, most of the session
will be closed, Belgrade radio said.
   The dramatic changes are a response to calls from the largest
republic, Serbia, and from workers, angered by falling living
standards.
   Ethnic Serbs want changes allowing their republic, one of
Yugoslavia's six, to have more control over the provinces of Kosovo
and Vojvodina.
   Workers want political and economic changes because they contend
the top party leaders are inefficent and corrupt.
   The criticism has touched even Suvar, who clashed last week with
Slobodan Milosevic, ambitious leader of the troubled republic of
Serbia. The clash prompted a wave of requests from Serbian party
organizations for Suvar's resignation.
   Milosevic's push for greater Serbian control of its two
provinces, Vojvodina and Kosovo and increased central control in
general in Yugoslavia has stirred up the current political crisis.
   Mass rallies have taken place all over eastern and southern
Yugoslavia in recent weeks to press this campaign.
   In a recent interview, Suvar said up to one-third of the Central
Committee could be replaced at the meeting, which is expected to
last at least two days.
   If several Politburo members and one-third of the Central
Committee do go, it would be the most sweeping change of top
personnel since the communists came to power after World War II.
   Supporters of Milosevic have said that if radical changes are
not agreed on at this meeting, they will demand an extraordinary
party congress to try and get the changes they want. The next such
forum is not due until 1990.
   Non-Serb leaders fear Milosevic is trying to use his mass
popularity in Yugoslavia's largest republic to expand the power of
the country's biggest ethnic group at the expense of others.
   Milosevic, in fomenting the rallies, has broken the order laid
down by the country's founding father Josip Tito, who gave broad
autonomy to Yugoslavia's six republics and two provinces and
annually rotated national offices among them to prevent one region
from dominating the others.

<HEAD>Car Bomb Planted By IRA Kills A Man</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The IRA said it planted a car
bomb that killed a man early today as he was driving near Belfast.
   The Irish Republican Army said in a statement to the news media
that Norman McKeown, 39, died because he worked for a company that
did building maintenance for the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
Northern Ireland's security forces.
   McKeown, sales manager for James Anderson Ltd., had driven about
200 yards from his home in Dundonald, just east of Belfast, when a
two-pound bomb attached to his car blew up, police said.
   McKeown's wife, who was in the car at the time of the explosion,
was treated in a hospital for minor injuries and released,
according to a police spokesman. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The IRA said the company supplied security window shutters and
fireproof materials to police stations and British army bases
throughout Northern Ireland and to court buildings in Belfast.
   The firm also did maintenance work at the Belfast-area offices
of Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, the IRA said. King is the
British Cabinet minister responsible for Northern Ireland.
   The IRA statement said McKeown was ``an associate'' of the
Ulster Volunteer Force, an outlawed Protestant group.
   ``The (Ulster Volunteer Force) with the active cooperation of
management, which included Norman McKeown, have been using
Anderson's premises ... for the storage of weapons and munitions,''
the statement said.
   The IRA alleged James Anderson had continued to do work for the
security forces despite repeated warnings to stop.
   The IRA's campaign to stop construction work for the security
forces began in August 1985 when a supplier of portable structures
to replace bombed buildings was shot and killed in his Dublin home.
Since then, several other contractors have been killed.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army is fighting to end British
rule in the predominantly Protestant province and unite it with the
mainly Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.

descending the world's fifth tallest mountain, the Tourism Ministry
said today.
   The ministry said Tomasz Kopys, 35, an electrical engineer, and
Ryszark Kolakowski, 34, a building engineer, both from Warsaw,
reached the summit of the 27,758-foot Himalayan peak on Friday, and
Kolakowski slipped on the mountain and disappeared while they were

   His five-day itinerary includes meetings with French and Jewish
leaders and a tour Wednesday to Normandy, where Herzog fought with
the British army during World War II.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France invited the Irish-born
Herzog when Mitterrand visited Israel in 1982.
   Herzog, 70, a former head of military intelligence, was

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. official met for the first time
today with two Americans who were detained after entering Laos to
publicize a $2.4 million reward for missing U.S. servicemen, a U.S.
Embassy official in Laos said.
   ``They looked all right and they did not allege any
mistreatment,'' the U.S. official said. ``But we still have no idea
of the charges against them or how the case will be disposed of.''
   Donna Long of Jacksonville, N.C., and James Copp of Hampstead,
N.C., took a rented fishing boat across the Mekong River boundary
between Thailand and Laos and were arrested Oct. 3 at a village in
the southern province of Champasak.
   They were moved last Wednesday to the Laotian capital of
Vientiane.
   The two were planning to pass out dollar bills and other
currency offering the reward to anyone who frees a U.S. prisoner
from communist-ruled Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam and turns him over
to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   These countries deny holding any Americans from the Vietnam War,
which ended in 1975.
   A U.S. Embassy consular officer was granted access to the two
Americans today after repeated requests, said the embassy official,
reached by telephone in Vientiane.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ms. Long
and Copp were being held at the passport office building, where
other foreigners have been held in recent years, generally for
illegal entry.
   The two are members of the National Steering Committee For
American War Veterans, a private lobbying group. The $2.4 million
reward for MIAs was offered by 21 U.S. congressmen and private
citizens.
   On Oct. 7, four other members of the committee sailed into the
same area of the Mekong and dropped stamped currency notes into the
water before the Thai navy told them to return to the Thai shore.
   That group was led by committee chairman Ted Sampley, a former
Green Beret from Kinston, N.C. He said last week the committee
would send another group of Vietnam War veterans to the Laotian
side of the river if Ms. Long and Copp were not freed soon.
   ``We will give Lao government officials some more Americans to
put in their jails until Jim and Donna are released so they can
return to their families,'' Sampley said in a telephone interview
from Kinston.
   The U.S. Embassy official in Vientiane said the Laotian
government was irritated at the group's activities on the Mekong,
and the official media there called it ``silly and insulting.''
   ``They find it offensive to them and their sovereignty and their
previous statements that they are not holding any live Americans,''
he said.
   However, he said Laos has not tried to link the episode to
overall relations with the United States.
   The United States still seeks to account for 2,393 Americans
listed as missing in action in the Southeast Asia war, but no solid
evidence has emerged that any are alive.

<HEAD>AIDS Victims' Sperm Is Free Of Virus</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to add full name of school.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Men with the AIDS virus have AIDS-free sperm,
raising the possibility that infected males may be able to father
children through artificial insemination without passing the
disease to the fetus, researchers say.
   Dr. Bernard Poiesz and colleagues at the State University of New
York Health Science Center at Syracuse found that the AIDS virus is
present in the seminal fluid in which the sperm is suspended but
not in the sperm cells themselves, The New York Times reported
today.
   Poiesz and researchers at the University of Southern California
working independently found that most men with AIDS do not even
have the virus in their semen, the Times said.
   Researchers are baffled by this finding because theoretically,
if AIDS is present in the blood, it should be present in semen,
since that fluid contains the white cells that the virus attacks.
   Poiesz reported the virus is present in about 20 percent of the
semen samples of infected men, while the virus is present in
virtually 100 percent of their blood samples.
   In contrast, several years ago Poiesz detected AIDS in 70
percent of semen samples from infected men.
   Dr. Suraiya Rasheed of USC also reported that researchers in her
laboratory were no longer able to detect the AIDS virus in most
semen samples from men whose blood samples show an infection rate
of virtually 100 percent.

<HEAD>Joan Strengthens Over Colombian Peninsula _ Bound For Open Water</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tropical Storm Joan's winds strengthened to 60 mph
today as it skimmed over the Colombian peninsula on a westward path
back out over the warm waters of the Caribbean, forecasters say.
   ``This storm has defied what it's supposed to do,'' said Miles
Lawrence, a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
``Any storm that passes that close to land should be weakening, not
strengthening.''
   At 9 a.m. EDT today, Joan's center was located near latitude
12.0 north and longitude 72.1 west, putting it over the Guajira
Peninsula of Colombia. The storm was moving west near 12 mph on a
path that would take it over the southwestern Caribbean Sea later
today.
   Although little additional strengthening was expected today,
Lawrence said the storm could become more powerful during the next
day or two as it moved over warm water.
   Joan, whose winds diminished Sunday to 45 mph, roared back to 60
mph today with gale-force gusts extending 50 miles. Four to 8
inches of rain was recorded along the storm's path.
   Tropical storm warnings remained in effect for the Guajira
Peninsula and Venezuela's Paraguana Peninsula and Monjes Islands.
Small craft in the area were asked to remain in port.
   On Tuesday, Joan became the 10th named system of the 1988
Atlantic hurricane season when top winds passed 39 mph. It would be
upgraded to a hurricane if its winds hit 74 mph.
   There have been four hurricanes during the six-month season that
ends Nov. 30. The worst was Hurricane Gilbert, which killed more
than 300 people and caused billions of dollars damage as it tore
through Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.

   Siamese twins Viet and Duc were recovering well
today, 13 days after they were separated in an operation at a
Vietnamese hospital, a Japanese Red Cross official said.
   Yoshiaki Nemoto quoted Yoji Araki, a Japanese doctor observing
the Vietnamese boys at Tu Du hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, as
saying the twins were doing ``very well.''
   Viet and Duc were separated Oct. 4 by a 72-member Vietnamese
medical team and have recovered without complications, Nemoto
quoted Araki as saying.
   The 7-year-old Vietnamese boys are believed to be the oldest
Siamese twins ever separated.
   Viet and Duc were joined at the pelvis and shared genitals and a
single pair of legs, as well as one bowel, an anus, a bladder and a
pair of kidneys.
   The Japan Red Cross donated most of the medical equipment and
medicine for the operation.
   Vietnamese officials have attributed the reported increase in
births of Siamese twins in Vietnam to the U.S. use of defoliants
during the Vietnam War, including in the central highlands where
Viet and Duc were born in February 1981.
   The defoliants included Agent Orange, which contains a compound,
dioxin, known to produce birth defects in animals.

   The head of a leading opposition party will
apologize for calling Latin American workers ``dregs,'' a party
official said today.
   Saburo Tsukamoto, secretary-general of the Democratic Socialist
Party, visited the Nicaraguan Embassy in Tokyo today to apologize,
according to party spokesman Eisei Itoh.
   Tsukamoto's decision to apologize was made after an executive
party meeting this morning, according to party spokesman Yukio
Hayashi.
   At a political seminar last Wednesday, Tsukamoto said that
``only the dregs remain'' in Latin America because ``the good
workers are enticed to the United States.'' He said this was a
cause of social unrest in the region.
   His remark was carried in most major Japanese newspapers the
next day.
   Diplomats representing Latin American nations in Japan lodged a
complaint Saturday with the party, calling for an apology from
Tsukamoto, according to William Tapia, first secretary of the
Nicaraguan Embassy.
   ``(We) have read with great surprise and indignation in the main
Japanese newspapers, your remarks ... describing the Latin American
workers as `dregs,''' the compaint said.
   ``Your ... remarks are inconsistant with the wishes of the
peoples and governments of both Japan and the Latin American and
Caribbean countries,'' it added.
   The protest was signed by Nicaraguan Ambassador Jorge C. Huezo,
dean of the diplomatic missions of Latin American and Caribbean
countries in Tokyo.
   In July, Michio Watanabe, policy chief of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, suggested that American blacks frequently use
credit cards but care little about paying their bills.
    Two years ago, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone angered
American minorities by saying the intelligence level in Japan was
higher than that in the United States because of a considerable
number of ``blacks, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans over there.''
Nakasone is a senior member of the Liberal Democratic Party.
   Both Watanabe and Naksone apologized for their remarks.

   An all-white DePauw University
fraternity that held a ``ghetto party'' has apologized for
decorating its house with racist graffiti that offended black
guests and led to a protest march.
   University President Robert G. Bottoms said the Alpha Tau Omega
fraternity house will face disciplinary proceedings that could lead
to punishment. Five other fraternities and sororities that
co-sponsored the party also face action.
   ``Certainly, the administration doesn't support or condone any
behavior that's offensive to our minority students, and we'll do
everything to get to the bottom of it,'' Bottoms said.
   The graffiti included disparaging remarks about blacks, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson and South Africa. In addition, some partygoers wore
black face and dressed as pimps and prostitutes.
   ``We now understand that the events in question were done in
poor taste,'' said fraternity president Jay Hoffman. ``The
decorations in question contained expressions that do not reflect
the opinions of any member of this living unit.''
   ``We are very, very sorry,'' he said. ``We feel great remorse
because of this.''
   The fraternity has no black members, but Hoffman said today that
it has no policy excluding blacks.
   Several black students who attended the party Friday found the
graffiti offensive, said officials at the private school that has
fewer than 5,000 students.
   During halftime of DePauw's homecoming football game Saturday,
members of the Association of Afro-American Students held a silent
march carrying signs protesting the party in front of students and
alumi.
   Following the game, more than 200 people, including Bottoms,
marched around the campus to the six fraternities and sororities
involved, peacefully protesting and singing ``We Shall Overcome.''

<TEXT>
   Five nuns who have spent nearly two
weeks barricaded inside the infirmary of their monastery to protest
modernization have called off talks with a priest sent by the
Vatican to end the impasse.
   The nuns rejected the Rev. Kevin Culligan, a friar from
Wisconsin, on Sunday because of his friendship with the monastery's
prioress, against whom they are rebelling, said Sister Bernadette,
one of the protesting nuns.
   They also challenge his legitimacy because he failed to show a
Vatican seal on his credentials, the nuns said. Talks Saturday
produced no agreement.
   ``He said he came here to assess whether this is an authentic
Carmelite monastery,'' Sister Bernadette said. ``We kept telling
him we have a case in Rome.''
   The Carmelite nuns today entered their 14th day in
self-segregation. Their actions have brought international
attention to the Roman Catholic Monastery of the Most Blessed
Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel.
   On Oct. 4, the five sisters of the Order of Discalced Carmelites
isolated themselves in the monastery's infirmary.
   They say they acted out of fear that the Diocese of Paterson
would evict them. The five oppose liberalization efforts that
include the introduction of sweets, radio and television that they
say detract from the life of prayer and austerity they vowed to
lead.
   They have said they will not give up their vigil until their
case is considered by the Vatican in Rome, which under canon law is
the official arbitrator in disputes within a religious order.
   Bishop Frank Rodimer, head of the diocese, has said the nuns
could be relieved of their vows for their defiance.

<HEAD>Court to hear Appeal in California Case on Tax-Fraud
Investigations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear a
Reagan administration appeal aimed at making it easier for the
government to conduct tax-fraud investigations.
   The justices said they will use a California case involving the
Church of Scientology to settle a dispute over the power of the
Internal Revenue Service to obtain and use confidential documents,
particularly communications between lawyers and clients.
   The government, which has had numerous legal battles with the
Scientologists, began an investigation in 1984 of the tax returns
of the church's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, who died on Jan. 24, 1986.
   The IRS said it suspected that millions of dollars in church
funds were transferred to Hubbard in the late 1970s and early 1980s
in a scheme to protect the church's tax-exempt status and avoid
paying taxes on the money.
   The IRS issued a summons in October 1984 for 13 confidential
documents held by a California state court in connection with a
private lawsuit involving the church.
   A federal judge ruled that five of the documents should be
turned over to the IRS but only on condition the IRS not disclose
the contents to any other governmental agency except in connection
with a criminal tax prosecution.
   The judge blocked the IRS from obtaining the other eight
documents, particularly taped conversations of confidential
lawyer-client communications.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge's ruling
in 1986.
   The appeals court said barring the IRS from turning over
documents to other agencies is a ``wise exercise of control'' by
the courts to protect the rights of citizens.
   The appeals court also said the government is not entitled to
see attorney-client communications unless it can produce
independent evidence that the lawyer is taking part in a fraud.
   The Justice Department, appealing on behalf of the IRS, proposed
that a federal judge examine the confidential documents to
determine whether there is evidence of fraud.
   The department said the appeals court ruling will
``significantly impair IRS investigations'' because ``the actual
contents of an attorney-client communication will often be the best
evidence'' of whether a lawyer has participated in fraud.
   The department also said the 9th Circuit court ruling is in
conflict with decisions by other federal appeals courts. The 9th
Circuit has jurisdiction in Arizona, Alaska, California, Hawaii,
Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.
   The case is U.S. vs. Zolin, 88-40.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Block Vaccine Lawsuit in Virginia Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to block a $10
million lawsuit against the manufacturer of a government-approved
whooping cough vaccine that allegedly caused brain damage in an
infant who was inoculated.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling in a Virginia
case that federal law does not foreclose such suits under state
regulations that protect consumers against defectively designed
products.
   Tracy Abbot was five months old in August 1983 when she was
inoculated with a vaccine called Tri-Immunol manufactured by
Lederle Laboratories, a division of American Cyanamid Co.
   Her mother filed a lawsuit in 1986, seeking $10 million in
damages on grounds the vaccine caused brain damage in Tracy.
   Tri-Immunol is a vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and
whooping cough _ or pertussis _ and is administered to millions of
children without serious side effects. But it has caused serious
injury in a small number of children.
   The vaccine is approved by the federal Food and Drug
Administration and other government health agencies.
   Whooping cough claimed thousands of lives before the vaccine was
developed. The most serious U.S. epidemic was in 1934 when there
were 265,000 reported cases and 7,500 deaths.
   The Abbot suit said Lederle failed to develop a safer whooping
cough vaccine, even though other forms of the vaccine have been
used outside the United States. The suit said Tri-Immunol is
``unreasonably dangerous.''
   Only one other company in the United States is licensed to
produce a whooping cough vaccine.
   A federal judge threw out the Abbot suit. But the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated it last April.
   The appeals court rejected arguments that the federal
government's interest in promoting use of the vaccine is frustrated
by permitting suits alleging violation of state regulations.
Federal law does not pre-empt such suits, the appeals court said.
   In a somewhat related issue, the Supreme Court ruled last June
that the government may be forced to pay damages when a vaccine it
licenses causes the disease it was intended to prevent. That case
reinstated a suit in behalf of a boy who contracted polio after
receiving a dose of federally approved vaccine.
   The Reagan administration has not announced a position on the
Abbot suit. But the Justice Department has pointed out that
alternative vaccines to the type Lederle produces have not been
proven safe and effective.
   Congress has passed a law which took full effect Oct. 1 creating
a fund to help compensate children injured by vaccines. The new law
places a tax on some vaccines to provide funds for injuries that
occur from vaccinations after 1986.
   The case is American Cyanamid vs. Abbot, 88-330.

   A small plane crashed while the pilot
apparently was trying to land on a narrow, winding road in one of
Arizona's most scenic areas, killing four people and critically
injuring a fifth.
   The single-engine Piper 300 crashed Sunday in an oak thicket in
Oak Creek Canyon, about 10 miles north of here. The pilot
apparently was trying to land on scenic, two-lane U.S. 89A, which
parallels Oak Creek in the canyon between Sedona and Flagstaff,
said Coconino County Detective Trevan Woolbright.
   Two New Jersey couples had booked the flight to tour the famous
Red Rocks area around Sedona, where a number of Western movies were
filmed, Woolbright said.
   Woolbright said the pilot, Robert Jackson, 51, had little room
to maneuver while he flew south in the canyon.
   ``It's really tight in there,'' he said. The plane sheared off
several oak trees and came to rest about 50 feet from the creek.
   Witnesses said the plane appeared to be having engine problems.
Mike Gooch, 35, said the engine was popping and stuttering as it
flew over his work place. John Stevens of nearby Oak Creek said he
heard the engine ``cutting out.''
   Wollbright identified the victims as Jackson; Charles and Jane
Branca of Pine Brook, N.J.; and Marilyn Richer of Rockaway, N.J.
Mrs. Richer's husband, Leon, was listed in very critical condition
today in the burn unit of Phoenix-based Maricopa Medical Center.

<HEAD>Court to Consider Ohio Retirement Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Associated Press Writer=
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
allowing states to give larger retirement benefits to public
employees forced to quit work before age 60.
   The court said it will review a ruling that struck down an Ohio
pension law provision on grounds it violated a federal law against
discrimination based on age.
   The Ohio provision was challenged by June Betts, a former speech
pathologist for the Hamilton County Mental Retardation Department.
   When her work degenerated because of medical problems, Ms. Betts
was given a choice by the state in 1985 of taking unpaid medical
leave or retirement with a standard pension.
   She was barred from receiving more generous disability
retirement benefits because she was 61.
   A provision of the state pension plan allowed disability
benefits only for those who worked for the state for at least five
years and were under 60 when forced to quit.
   Ms. Betts' pension would have been $158.50 a month under the
standard plan, compared to $355 a month in disability retirement
benefits.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last June upheld a federal
judge's ruling in Ms. Betts' favor that threw out the state's
age-based pension provision.
   The appeals court said the provision violated the federal Age
Discrimination in Employment Act.
   The appeals court said the federal law permits age-based
benefits only when they ``can be justified by a substantial
business purpose.''
   Ohio officials failed to prove that giving larger benefits to
younger workers is justified by cost considerations, the appeals
court said.
   In fact, the appeals court said, such an arrangement might prove
more costly to the state since a worker who becomes disabled at a
younger age would draw more in benefits over the course of the
worker's lifetime than someone disabled at 60 or older.
   Ohio officials argued that the state's age-based provision is
permissible because it was adopted prior to enactment of the
federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The state said
federal appeals courts other than the 6th Circuit have agreed with
its position.
   The case is Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio vs.
Betts, 88-389.

   A Uganda Airlines jet with 52 people aboard crashed,
broke into pieces and burned early today while trying to land in
heavy fog at Rome's main airport. Officials reported 30 people were
killed.
   All of the surviving 22 people on Flight 775 from London's
Gatwick airport to Entebbe, Uganda, via Rome, apparently were
injured, said Carlo Iovinella, director of the airport police.
   The Boeing 707 tore through the side of a wooden house, clipped
a garage, demolished an unoccupied brick house and then barreled
through the parking lot of a rental car agency.
   At that point, an engine and part of a wing fell off and the
impact started a fire that destroyed about 75 cars.
   The rest of the plane slid across a road, through a fence and
knocked down trees before it broke into pieces and burst into
flames about a half-mile south of the runway at Leonardo da Vinci
airport, 15 miles southwest of Rome.
   One man in the wooden house, Carlo Satta, 30, suffered minor
injuries when the roof collapsed.
   ``I was awake and heard a ringing sound. Two seconds later it
sounded like the gas cylinders in the house had blown up. A few
seconds later all the cars were in flames,'' said the injured man's
father, Luigi.
   Passenger John Harigye, a former Ugandan ambassador to the
Vatican who was hospitalized in good condition with burns, told the
Italian news agency ANSA that the plane aborted one landing attempt
because of the fog and tried again about 15 minutes later.
   ``It was at this point that one heard a very violent collision
and immediately afterwards the flames burst out,'' he said. ``My
seat was upside down, but I released my seat belt, opened the
emergency exit and got out with the woman sitting near me. We began
to run and we heard a second explosion on the airplane.''
   The commander of Rome Province's fire department, Guido
Chiucini, speculated the pilot and the control tower might have had
a ``misunderstanding'' about the landing.
   Police said one of the dead was identified as a Ugandan. Twelve
Ugandans and three Britons were among the injured, but the
nationalities of the others aboard were not immediately available.
   Workers had recovered the remains of at least 28 victims at the
crash scene, and two others died at hospitals, officials said.
Other bodies were thought to be hidden in the wreckage.
   While firefighters raked through the debris at dawn, the charred
hulk of the airliner lay smoking. Two bodies covered with sheets
lay near the wrecked aircraft. Seat cushions, boxes, a makeup case
and a twisted doll were scattered in the mud nearby.
   Renato Ubasi, an aviation authority official, said searchers had
found the cockpit voice recorder. ANSA said police recovered a
flight data recorder.
   In Kampala, Uganda, Osende Odoi, general manager of the airline,
said the aircraft had been modified to reduce noise and was
returned to service earlier this year.
   Airport director Raffaele Casagrande said in a statement that 45
passengers and seven crew members were aboard the jetliner when it
crashed at 12:31 a.m. He said 24 injured people were taken to four
hospitals. Officials said two died later.
   Iovinella said the cause of the crash was not been determined.
   ANSA said the tower gave permission for the plane to land and
reported a visibility of 4,920 feet. It said the tower called the
plane again when it didn't respond. Moments later, it said, workers
reported a fire at the end of the runway.
   The last airline disaster in Italy was the crash of the domestic
airline ATI turbo-prop near Lake Como that killed all 37 aboard
Oct. 15, 1987. The plane crashed moments after takeoff from Linate
Airport in Milan on a flight to West Germany.

<TEXT>
   Reputed Philadelphia-area crime boss Nicodemo
Scarfo lost a Supreme Court appeal today to overturn his
extortion-conspiracy conviction.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that Scarfo did
not receive a fair trial.
   Scarfo, described as the head of organized crime in eastern
Pennsylvania and parts of New Jersey, is serving a 14-year prison
term for scheming to extort $1 million from a developer of the
Penn's Landing redevelopment project on the Philadelphia waterfront.
   The developer, Rouse & Associates, told the FBI of the extortion
plan that called for it to pay $1 million in exchange for backing
from Philadelphia city Councilman Leland Beloff for the project.
   Beloff and his administrative aide, Robert Rego, were tried
separately and convicted in the kickback scheme.
   Scarfo said he did not receive a fair trial in part because the
jurors' names were withheld when they were selected. They were
identified only by number.
   Also, the trial judge in explaining the reason for the anonymity
told the jurors he wanted to assure them that they or their
families had no reason to fear.
   ``There will be a lot of testimony concerning organized crime,''
the judge said. ``I have never heard of a case where any defendant
ever tried to cause harm to a juror or a member of the juror's
family. But we all watch television. We all read newspapers. We see
the Godfather movies. I wanted to make sure that no member of the
jury would worry about it.''
   Also, Scarfo said the jury was influenced improperly by
testimony about extraneous crimes presented with ``frightening
imagery and detail.''
   For example, the prosecutor summed up the case by saying Scarfo
``is a shrewd, clever and dangerous man. He rules his criminal army
with a deadly iron fist. He keeps his soldiers in mortal fear.''
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the conviction last
July.
   The appeals court said anonymity for the jurors and the
explanation the trial judge gave for the procedure may have helped
dispel the jurors' fears and served ``the ideal of dispassionate
judgment.''
   The appeals court also upheld the use of testimony by mob hit
men who testified for the government that they carried out murders
at Scarfo's behest.
   The prosecution used the testimony to try and prove that the
witnesses cooperated with the government for fear they would meet
the same fate, the appeals court said.
   The case is Scarfo vs. U.S., 88-498.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five reputed organized crime figures from
Michigan who challenged FBI wiretaps that led to their
gambling-related convictions lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that evidence
from the electronic surveillance could be used against them.
   The appeals were by Vito Giacalone; his son, Jack; Anthony
Giacolone, Mario Agosta and Albert Hady.
   All but Anthony Giacalone were convicted of taking part in a
racketeering scheme to collect illegal gambling debts. Anthony
Giacalone was convicted of conducting illegal gambling.
   Under a plea bargain agreement, each was sentenced to one to
five years in prison. They pleaded guilty while reserving the right
to appeal the convictions and pretrial rulings.
   The defendants challenged the use of wiretaps at Farm Fresh
Produce Inc. in Detroit.
   FBI agents said confidential informants told them local
restaurant owners were being threatened and intimidated into
purchasing food from Farm Fresh.
   The wiretaps, approved by a federal judge on July 28, 1982, were
intended to gather evidence of extortion.
   The wiretaps remained in place for nearly five months. And while
the FBI failed to get evidence of extortion, it did get enough to
win an indictment in 1986 against the five on the gambling-related
charges.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last August rejected
arguments that the wiretaps were unlawful and that evidence yielded
by them should be suppressed.
   The five defendants said a federal judge should have questioned
the FBI informants in private to determine their veracity before
allowing evidence from the wiretaps to be used.
   But the 6th Circuit court said it was enough that the judge
questioned the FBI agents behind closed doors.
   ``Suppression is required only when (the law enforcement
official seeking a wiretap) deliberately lied or testified in
reckless disregard of the truth,'' the appeals court said.
   The appeals court also rejected arguments that the wiretaps were
approved without probable cause to believe the defendants would use
their telephones for extortion.
   The judge who approved the wiretaps ``could reasonably conclude
that there was a fair probability that defendants would refer to
their illegal activities during the course of their telephone
conversations with their customers and others,'' the appeals court
said.
   The appeals court also dismissed the defendants' claim that the
surveillance was too extensive.
   The case is Giacalone vs. U.S., 88-509.

   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres today
proposed elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to
select Palestinians who would negotiate peace with Israel.
   The call was part of a policy statement issued by Peres and
Labor's Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin in the campaign for Israel's
general elections Nov. 1.
   Polls indicate Labor and the governing Likud bloc are running
neck-and-neck.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip today, troops shot and wounded eight
Palestinians, including two 13-year-old boys, during clashes in the
towns of Rafah and Khan Yunis, hospital officials said.
   On Sunday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of the Likud
bloc, vowed that ``nothing will remain'' of Palestinians who carry
out threats to use firearms against Israel.
   Peres and Rabin told reporters today that any Palestinian living
in the occupied territories should be permitted to run in
elections, even if they supported the banned Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   The Labor leaders said a cessation of anti-Israeli violence for
a period of three to six months was a precondition for such
elections.
   ``If the violence is restrained, we will hold free elections in
Judea, Samaria and Gaza so that a Palestinian ... delegation can be
elected (to) represent the Palestinian side in negotiations,''
Peres said, using the biblical names for the West Bank.
   He said that if efforts to arrange formal peace negotiations
fail, a Labor-led government would transfer control of municipal
and local affairs to elected leaders from the territories, with the
Israeli army only in charge of security. The army now runs daily
municipal affairs in the occupied lands.
   Elections were last held in the West Bank in 1976, when mayors
were chosen in major towns and cities. The officials all supported
the PLO and refused to act as representatives in peace negotiations.
   Shamir made his remark against Palestinian use of firearms
Sunday to more than 2,000 supporters in the southern town of
Sderot, according to his spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir.
   Ahimeir said Shamir was responding to Arab news reports that
Hani Hassan, an aide to PLO chief Yasser Arafat, had said
Palestinians would exchange their stone-throwing methods against
Israeli troops for firearms if Shamir is re-elected prime minister.
   ``If the Arabs of Judea, Samaria and Gaza start fighting the
army with firearms, nothing will remain of those terrorists, and
there is no doubt that an end will come to the intefadeh (Arabic
for uprising),'' Shamir said, according to Ahimeir.
   So far, Palestinians have primarily confronted Israeli troops
and civilians with stones, bottles and firebombs.
   However, the recent use of firearms by Palestinians included two
grenades hurled at army vehicles in Gaza last week, injuring two
soldiers.
   The 10-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israel, in which
299 Arabs have been killed and about 7,000 wounded, has emerged as
the primary issue in the national elections. Six Israelis have been
killed in the unrest.
   Army figures show 896 Israelis have been injured in the
rebellion, including 575 troops and 321 civilians, Israel radio
reported.
   The Likud bloc opposes withdrawal from the lands Israel captured
in the 1967 Middle East War.

   A researcher who shared the Nobel Prize for
medicine today said the best reward is still knowing his work has
saved lives, while his longtime colleague says she was more
disbelieving than anything after journalists gave her the news.
   ``The phone keeps ringing and I can't seem to finish getting
dressed or anything else,'' said Gertrude Elion, a researcher at
Burroughs Wellcome Co. since 1944, from her home in Chapel Hill.
``I think I'm going to have trouble getting to work on time.''
   Elion, 70; George H. Hitchings, 83, another longtime Wellcome
researcher; and a British scientist shared the award and will split
a prize worth $390,000.
   ``It's wonderful for my descendents,'' joked Hitchings, a former
Burroughs Wellcome vice president. ``I've had many awards, but my
real awards have come from patients whose lives have been saved by
the drugs I've invented.''
   The work of Elion and Hitchings led to a series of drugs for the
treatment of cancer and a variety of other diseases. Burroughs
Wellcome is a major pharmaceutical company.
   Elion said she first got the news at 6:30 a.m. from a reporter
and had not yet heard from Nobel officials.
   ``Surprised is not exactly the word,'' she said, when asked her
reaction to the prize. ``Disbelieving is the right word. As I say,
I haven't heard from the Nobel people, and until they confirm it, I
won't believe it. I did not even know I had been nominated for it.''
   She said a reporter had read her parts of the citation, ``but it
was fairly vague. I don't even know exactly what the award is for
at this point.''
   She said she had collaborated with Hitchings for more than 40
years.
   ``That's why it's so surprising when something like this happens
after so many years,'' she said.
   ``I haven't been able to use the phone to call him,'' she said
of Hitchings. ``But other people who have called have told me they
talked to him, so I know he knows about it. I think I'll have to go
use a phone somewhere else, but first I've got to run a comb
through my hair.''
   Hitchings, who was born in Hoquiam, Wash., received a doctorate
in biochemistry from Harvard in 1933 and holds more than 80
American patents. He joined Burroughs Wellcome in 1942 as a
biochemist and retired in 1975 as vice president for research.
   Elion, a native of New York City, received a bachelor's degree
from Hunter College in 1937, and a master's degree in chemistry
from New York University in 1941. She joined Burroughs Wellcome in
1944 as a biochemist. In 1967, she was appointed head of the
department of experimental therapy, a position she held until her
retirment in 1983.
   Hitchings and Elion followed a line of nucleic acid research
that led to the discovery of new drugs for malaria, leukemia, gout,
bacterial infections and the first immune suppressant to make
kidney transplants possible, the company said.
   The drugs developed by the two scientists include Imuran, for
kidney transplants; Purinethol, a cancer drug used to treat
leukemia patients; Zyloprim, for gout; and Zovirax, the first drug
developed for the treatment of herpes virus infections, said
Burroughs Wellcome spokeswoman Kathy Bartlett.
   The researchers hold the title of scientist emeritus at
Burroughs Wellcome, signifying that they are retired. Despite their
retirement, both have continued to work on projects, said another
company spokesman, Thack Brown.
   ``Both of them still come to work every day,'' Brown said.
``They both have their own research projects, but they were so
involved in so many things that were going on in research that
they're still consulted.''
   This is the third Nobel Prize for Burroughs Wellcome, Ms.
Bartlett said.
   In 1936, Sir Henry Dale, an early director of research and
chairman of the Wellcome Trust, was awarded a Nobel in medicine for
his studies of chemical transmission of nerve impulses. In 1982,
Sir John Vane, group research and development director, won a Nobel
in medicine for his role in discovering the way in which aspirin
works to reduce pain and inflammation.

   Fifty-nine children found crowded in a
four-bedroom farmhouse should remain in state custody while
authorities investigate the beating death of an 8-year-old girl,
officials said.
   Four people have been charged with murder in the death of Dayna
Lorea Broussard, the daughter of the founder of a Los Angeles-based
Christian center established to train and discipline inner-city
youngsters.
   George Coleman, chief deputy state medical examiner, said Sunday
the girl had been ``whipped severely'' and suffered fatal
``blunt-force injuries.''
   There also was evidence of an old injury on her body, Coleman
said.
   Police said several adults from the rural home near Sandy, which
once served as the headquarters for the now-defunct Ecclesia
Athletic Association, brought the dead child to a fire station 25
miles east of Portland early Friday.
   Investigators later found the other children in the four-bedroom
farmhouse, some with scars that might indicate physical abuse, said
sheriff's Capt. Pat Detloff.
   The children, ranging in age from 1{ months to 16 years, were
hungry but otherwise healthy, according to officials who admitted
them to state juvenile facilities over the weekend. All reportedly
were from Los Angeles.
   ``Based on everything we know right now, we'll recommend
continued (state) custody,'' said Bart Wilson, a branch manager of
the state Children's Services Division.
   The division planned to ask authorities to approve the custody
extension at a juvenile court hearing in Oregon City this afternoon.
   ``We've had little contact with the parents,'' Wilson said.
``We've not heard from very many of them.''
   The father of the dead girl, Eldridge Broussard Jr., leader of
the Watts Christian Center, arrived from Los Angeles and was
interviewed Sunday by sheriff's investigators.
   Broussard, 35, has said that his group has been trying to
promote spiritual and moral values through athletics, but has
complained that the media have portrayed him as a ``crackpot.''
   Last year, Ecclesia officials claimed to have established a camp
at the Sandy site to train children for the Olympics. But it was
unclear if the children found last week were engaged in a similar
training program.
   Charged with murder in the girl's death were Brian James
Brinson, 30; Constance Zipporah Jackson, 37; Frederick Paul
Doolittle, 28; and Willie K. Chambers, 35, all of Los Angeles. They
remain in custody in the county jail.
   Two other adults connected with Broussard's group were charged
with hindering prosecution and were jailed pending $100,000 bail
each.

   An Afghan guerrilla leader said today
the Soviet Union wants direct talks with the Moslem forces fighting
the Moscow-backed Afghan government. Official Afghan radio said
troops killed two Americans who were helping guerrillas.
   ``The green lights have been shown'' for direct negotiations,
said Burhanuddin Rabbani, current chairman of a seven-party Afghan
guerrilla alliance headquartered in Peshawar, Pakistan. He did not
elaborate.
   ``The negotiations and how they will happen will be seen in the
future,'' Rabbani told reporters after returning from a five-week
trip to northern Afghanistan.
   No comment to the report was immediately available from the
Soviet Union.
   In negotiating a U.N.-mediated agreement in April to withdraw
Soviet troops, Moscow did not meet with the U.S.-backed guerrillas
and spoke instead with Pakistani officials.
   Rabbani ruled out any coalition government that included
communists but he said there was room in a guerrilla-controlled
government for ``some elements from Kabul.''
   ``Non-communist elements working in Kabul could be included,''
he said.
   Official Radio Kabul on Sunday did not identify the Americans
reportedly killed in the attack a day earlier, but a Western
diplomat in Islamabad denied U.S. citizens were in Afghanistan on
government business. The broadcast contended the Americans were
helping the guerrillas.
   The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he had
heard nothing of American citizens being killed in Afghanistan.
   Soviet officials often have alleged that U.S. personnel trains
guerrilla forces near the Afghan border in Pakistan. American
reporters often travel to the Afghan capital, Kabul, and to other
areas.
   Radio Kabul, in a broadcast monitored in Islamabad, said the
Americans and two Pakistani officers died Saturday when government
forces attacked Moslem guerrilla positions near Gardez city, about
60 miles southeast of Kabul.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck said she
knew nothing of the report and said she could not even say whether
any Americans were in Afghanistan.
   In recent years, three Americans have been killed in Afghanistan
_ Charles Thornton, a reporter for the Arizona Republic newspaper,
and independent filmmakers Lee Shapiro of North Bergen, N.J., and
Jim Landiloff of Sacramento, Calif.
   The Pakistani government had no immediate comment on the report.
   In other developments, the Afghan Foreign Ministry sent its
100th note of protest alleging Pakistani violations of the
U.N.-mediated agreement aimed at ending the fighting in
Afghanistan, Tass said.
   The accord, signed April 14 in Geneva, requires the Soviet Union
to withdraw its armed forces from Afghanistan by February. The
Soviets say half of their more than 100,000 troops are back home.
   The Soviets and the Afghans accuse Pakistan of violating the
agreement by allowing its territory to be used as a base by
U.S.-backed rebel groups and by permitting arms and munitions to
cross Pakistan to the insurgents.
   The Soviets intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979 to
preside over the replacement of one Marxist ruler by another and
stayed on to fight the insurgency.

   A man who lost a cabin to
this summer's fires in the Yellowstone National Park area has filed
a claim with the U.S. Forest Service and expects others to join in
his legal action.
   Dr. Glenn Watters, whose $60,000, nearly finished cabin in Cooke
Pass north of Powell was one of four destroyed when a backfire
started by firefighters roared out of control, predicts a rash of
lawsuits against the government unless it properly reimburses
property owners for their losses.
   ``There will be the darnedest class-action lawsuit you ever saw
in your life,'' he told the Denver Post.
   Fires charred more than 1.6 million acres in the worst fire
season in the park's history.
   ``I think we were betrayed,'' said Charlotte Ficken of Powell,
whose mobile home southeast of Cooke City, Mont., was destroyed by
fires despite firefighters' assurances it would be protected. ``I
just don't think we got any help. So we just burned.''
   Federal policies call for claims to be paid only if government
negligence can be proven, but Watters said he does not believe that
will be a problem.
   ``The (National) Park Service realizes they blew it,'' he said.
``They tell you now that they were suppressing those fires, but
they weren't. They were as proud as peacocks of those natural fires
that they were letting burn _ and then they let things get away
from them.''
   Under National Park Service and Forest Service policies,
naturally caused fires in parks or wilderness areas were allowed to
burn unless they threatened structures or safety. Both agencies
switched to the offensive against fires in July because of
extremely dry conditions.
   A number of business owners around the park have claimed they
lost money because the fires discouraged travelers from visiting
the Yellowstone area.
   Four Wyoming counties have been declared disaster areas,
clearing the way for low-interest loans, but the loans are not
expected to help those who lost summer or permanent homes or
outfitters who lost business because of the fires.

   A 16-year-old girl who crashed through a
skylight while taking yearbook pictures on the roof of her high
school has died after two days in a coma, authorities said.
   Rabsary Gutierrez, a junior at Hialeah-Miami Lakes High, dropped
30 feet on Friday when she apparently misjudged her step and
plunged through the glass skylight onto a concrete stairway,
suffering head, brain and lung injuries.
   She never regained consciousness and died Sunday at Jackson
Memorial Hospital, said Principal Bill Noble.
   ``She was a real sweet person whom everybody cared about,'' he
said. ``This has been real difficult for all of us who knew her.''
   Special counselors came to the school today to help students
deal with the tragedy, he said.
   Miss Gutierrez had just taken a picture on top of the
three-story building when she tried to step over the skylight.
Instead, she crashed through as a teacher and 24 students looked
on, police Lt. Lowell Coffin said.
   The students had been warned to walk around the skylight, and
students had gone on the roof previously to take pictures without
incident, officials said.

   American researchers Gertrude Elion and
George H. Hitchings won the 1988 Nobel Prize in medicine today for
discoveries leading to drugs that treat AIDS and herpes.
   Sir James W. Black of Great Britain shared the award for
research that led to a beta blocker drug for heart disease and a
drug for peptic ulcers. Black quipped today that the prize came as
such a shock that ``I wished I had my beta blockers handy.''
   The Americans' research also led to the development of drugs for
the treatment of leukemia, malaria, and to fight the rejection of
transplanted organs, said the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska
Institute.
   Elion, 70, a New York City native, and Hitchings, 83, born in
Hoquiam, Wash., are affiliated with Wellcome Research Laboratories
in Research Triangle Park, N.C. Black, 64, born in Scotland, works
at King's College Hospital Medical School at the University of
London.
   ``I'm pleased more for my descendants than I am for myself,''
Hitchings said in a telephone interview from his office. ``I've had
a lot of honors, but the most important honors for me have been
meeting patients whose lives have been saved or whose children's
lives have been saved by drugs I've invented.''
   Elion said from her home in Chapel Hill, N.C.: ``Surprised is
not exactly the word. ``Disbelieving is the right word. ... I
didn't even know I had been nominated.''
   The work of Elion and Hitchings broke new ground in finding the
difference in the processing of genetic material between normal
cells and cancer cells, protozoa, bacteria and viruses, the
Karolinska Institute said.
   Knowing those differences allowed researchers to attack
disease-causing organisms by interfering with their replication,
the announcement said.
   The institute said that among the drugs developed from their
ideas is azidothymidine, or AZT, which has had the best documented
results in the treatment of AIDS, the institute said. AZT is the
only federally approved drug for treating acquired immune
deficiency syndrome in the United States.
   ``We are still harvesting the fruits of what they determined
almost 40 years ago,'' said Folke Sjoqvist, a member of the Nobel
Assembly.
   Their discoveries in the late 1940s led to a variety of drugs,
like 6-mercaptopurine in 1951 for leukemia. They also developed
azathioprine, which was for many years the only drug available to
prevent the rejection of transplanted organs.
   Another breakthrough in applying their research came in 1977,
when the first effective drug was developed for treating herpes
virus infections. The drug, acyclovir, does not cure genital
herpes, but it makes outbreaks of sores less severe and makes them
heal faster.
   In 1964, Black developed the first clinically useful beta
blocker drug, propranolol, for use in the treatment of heart
disease.
   Propranolol acts on beta receptors on nerves leading to the
heart and blocks the stimulating effect of adrenaline. Receptors
are specific places to which drugs and natural substances attach
themselves to produce their effects.
   Physiologist Bengt Pernow, another member of the Nobel Assembly,
said Black made ``the greatest breakthrough when it comes to
pharmaceuticals against heart illness since the disovery of
digitalis 200 years ago.''
   In 1972, Black discovered a group of histamine receptors, a
finding that led to the development of the drug cimetidine for
peptic ulcer.
   The three winners will share a cash award of 2.5 million kronor,
or about $390,000, which they will receive at an awards ceremony
Dec. 10.
   The prize was approved by a majority vote of the institute's
50-member Nobel Assembly on the recommendation of a five-member
committee which studied hundreds of research briefs.
   Hitchings received a bachelor's degree from the University of
Washington in 1927 and a doctorate from Harvard University in 1933.
   After teaching at Harvard and Western Reserve University, he
joined Burroughs Wellcome Co., a pharmaceutical firm, in 1942.
Wellcome Research Laboratories is the company's research arm.
   Hitchings became Burroughs Wellcome's research director in 1955.
He was a director of the company from 1968 to 1984 and has been a
professor at Duke University and Brown University.
   Elion earned her bachelor's degree from Hunter College and a
master's degree from New York University.
   She has worked at Wellcome Research Labs since 1944 and as a
senior research chemist since 1950. Since 1983, she has been a
scientist emeritus at the laboratory and a research professor of
pharmacology at Duke.
   Black received bachelor of surgery and bachelor of medicine
degrees from University of St. Andrews in Scotland.
   The medicine prize is the first of four Nobel prizes to be
announced this week. On Tuesday, the laureate in economic sciences
will be named, and prizes in physics and chemistry will be awarded
Wednesday.
   The Nobels were first awarded in 1901, five years after the
death of Alfred Nobel, who made a fortune on his invention of
dynamite.
   No U.S. researcher won the medicine prize until 1933. In the
last 20 years there have been 30 U.S. laureates and 19 from all
other countries.
   Last year's winner was Susumu Tonegawa of Japan, who conducted
his study of the body's immune system at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
   The Nobel Peace prize went this year to the U.N. peacekeeping
forces. The literature prize was won by Egyptian Naguib Mahfouz,
the first Arabic-language laureate in the 87-year history of the
Nobels.

<HEAD>Court to Consider Reinstating Conviction in Dallas Flag-Burning</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 9-21, In other action, with other cases</NOTE>

   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
reinstating a criminal conviction against a man who burned an
American flag at a demonstration during the 1984 Republican
National Convention in Dallas.
   The court said it will review a ruling that the flag burning was
a form of symbolic expression protected by the Constitution.
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals last April threw out the
conviction of Gregory Lee Johnson, who had been sentenced to one
year in jail and fined $2,000.
   Johnson was arrested on Aug. 22, 1984, while participating in a
demonstration against the Reagan administration and the Republicans.
   The protest had culminated with a rally in front of Dallas City
Hall that included political chants and the flag burning.
   Johnson was convicted by a jury of violating a state law banning
the desecration of a venerated object.
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said, ``Given the context of
an organized demonstration, speeches, slogans and the distribution
of literature, anyone who observed (Johnson's) act would have
understood the message that (he) intended to convey. The act for
which (he) was convicted was clearly `speech' contemplated by the
First Amendment.''
   The state court said the Texas law against flag desecration is
too broad because it seeks to curb expression likely to cause
``serious offense.''
   In other action, the court:
   _ Set the stage for an important libel law ruling by agreeing to
review a $200,000 award won against a Hamilton, Ohio, newspaper.
   The court will use an appeal by the Hamilton Journal News to
decide, sometime by July, how closely appeals courts must
scrutinize jury findings of ``actual malice'' when a public figure
sues for libel.
   _ Refused to block a $10 million lawsuit against the
manufacturer of a government-approved whooping cough vaccine that
allegedly caused brain damage in an infant who was inoculated.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling in a Virginia
case that federal law does not foreclose such suits under state
regulations that protect consumers against defectively designed
products.
   _ Left intact the espionage and theft convictions of a former
U.S. intelligence analyst who gave secret satellite photographs to
a British magazine.
   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal by Samuel
Loring Morison, who is serving a two-year prison sentence for
leaking the photos of a Soviet ship to Jane's Defence Weekly.
   _ Agreed to hear a Reagan administration appeal aimed at making
it easier for the government to conduct tax-fraud investigations.
   The justices said they will use a California case involving the
Church of Scientology to settle a dispute over the power of the
Internal Revenue Service to obtain and use confidential documents,
particularly communications between lawyers and clients.
   _ Agreed to consider allowing states to give larger retirement
benefits to public employees forced to quit work before age 60.
   The court said it will review a ruling that struck down an Ohio
pension law provision on grounds it violated a federal law against
discrimination based on age.
   _ Ordered a lower court to consider reinstating a Virginia law
that limits access by children to sexually explicit material in
bookstores.
   The justices set aside a ruling that declared the law
unconstitutional and ordered further study in light of a new
analysis that said the statute has limited applications.
   In the flag case, police officers who arrested Johnson said they
were seriously offended by the flag burning.
   There also was testimony that the charred fragments of the flag
were collected by an employee of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
who was so upset that he later buried the flag's remains in his
backyard.
   But the state court said seriously offending someone is not the
same as inciting to riot _ an activity that permits restraints on
free speech.
   ``One cannot equate `serious offense' with incitement to breach
the peace,'' the state court said.
   The state court also rejected arguments by law enforcement
officials that the anti-desecration statute legitimately preserves
the flag ``as a symbol of unity.''
   ``Recognizing that the right to differ is the centerpiece of our
First Amendment freedoms, a government cannot mandate by fiat a
feeling of unity in its citizens,'' the state court said.
``Therefore that very same government cannot carve out a symbol of
unity and prescribe a set of approved messages to be associated
with that symbol when it cannot mandate the status or feeling the
symbol purports to present.''
   The state court did not declare the law itself unconstitutional.
It declined to decide whether there might be situations where flag
burning does not represent symbolic speech and may be prosecuted.
   The state court cited several Supreme Court rulings to support
its decision, including a 1974 ruling that threw out the conviction
of a man who displayed an American flag with a peace symbol
attached to it.
   The case is Texas vs. Johnson, 88-155.

   Two Dartmouth College graduate students
who were rappelling down steep cliffs were killed after plunging to
a trail below, authorities said today.
   ``They were rappelling down and apparently were both tied to the
same anchor point, and when one fell it broke the point where it
was tied off,'' said Maj. Henry Mock of the state Fish and Game
Department.
   About 50 rescuers worked more than five hours on 4,060-foot
Cannon Mountain to retrieve the bodies of Joel Sunshine, 24, of
Irvine, Calif., and Marc Fragge, 23, of Fort Mitchell, Ky., Mock
said.
   The two were climbing a section of Cannon Cliffs called ``Beware
of the Dog.''
   Mock said authorities had not determined how far the two fell,
but believe the accident happened at 3:38 p.m. Sunday because a
watch strapped to one of the climber's packs was smashed and had
stopped at that time.
   Two other climbers who were hiking the trail below Cannon Cliffs
found the bodies at 5:20 p.m., Mock said.
   Both men were engineering students at Dartmouth's Thayer School,
said Dartmouth spokesman Rick Adams.

<TEXT>
   A group of U.S. physicians that toured
Kurdish refugee camps has concluded Iraq used chemical weapons
against the ethnic Kurdish minority in northern Iraq, a spokesman
said.
   Dr. Robert Mullan Cook-Deegan, representing the Boston-based
Physicians for Human Rights, said Iraq most likely used ``a high
dose of one of the kind of irritant agents or a nerve agent.'' He
did not elaborate.
   The physician also accused Turkey of covering up Iraq's use of
chemical weapons for security and economic reasons.
   Turkey wants to keep good relations with Iraq and win a role in
rebuilding the nation after its 8-year war with Iran.
   A Turkish government report maintains no traces of poison gas
were found on the refugees during medical screenings. But Turkish
officials have said their report does not eliminate the possibility
that Iraq used such weapons.
   Cook-Deegan said the group's findings were based on interviews
with more than 100 Kurds who fled into Turkey and also on medical
questionnaires given to 25 refugees.
   The doctor, a senior associate working for the office of
Technology Assessment at the U.S. Congress, spoke to The Associated
Press in an interview Thursday on condition the information be used
Sunday after the three-member delegation left Turkey.
   The team's other two members were Dr. Howaro Hu from the Harvard
School of Public Health and Asfandiar Shukri, a Detroit-based
physician.
   About 60,000 Kurds fled to Turkey in August, claiming Iraq
dropped chemical bombs on their settlements. They now live in five
tent cities in southeastern Turkey.
   ``It is difficult to explain the sudden exodus of people that
were used to being shot at. If it would have been a conventional
weapon attack, there would have been evidence of physical injuries
such as bullet wounds,'' Cook-Deegan said.
   ``Iraq used chemical weapons particularly on a population within
its border,'' he said.
   He said the Kurdish refugees most commonly complained about
bloody diarrhea, vomiting, skin irritation, and eye and respiratory
problems.
   ``Those are very typical symptoms of chemical agents called
irritants,'' Cook-Deegan said.
   He added that the refugees also described small animals such as
birds and bees dying right after the attack.
   Cook-Deegan criticized the Turkish government for witholding
information about the issue.
   He said the Turkish government also did not release the results
of autopsy reports on Kurdish refugees who died immediately after
arriving in Turkey.
   The Turkish government announced a month ago that it would turn
down any efforts to send U.N. experts into Turkey to determine if
Iraq used poison gas against Kurds.
   The 14-page questionnaire used by the three-member team
contained dozens of queries requiring detailed answers about the
respondent's health before and after the attack.
   Cook-Deegan said they will analyze the questionnaires and
prepare a report in a month.
   Investigators for the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee
also reported after touring the refugee camps in Turkey that Iraq
used chemical weapons in attacks to depopulate Iraq's Kurdish
regions.
   ``We find no question that Iraq's policy in Kurdistan has the
characteristics of genocide,'' the two staff members, Peter W.
Galbraith and Christopher Von Hollen Jr., concluded in a report to
the Foreign Relations Commitee chairman, Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.,
last month.
   The Kurds, 20 million people living in a region that lies in
Turkey, Iran, and Iraq, have been fighting battles for independence
for the past century.
   The latest rebellion took advantage of Iraq's war with Iran.
   Soon after an Aug. 20 cease-fire went into effect in that war,
Iraq turned upon the Kurds, unleashing war-hardened elite troops
upon the Kurdish guerrillas.

   George Bush today resumed his attack on
presidential rival Michael Dukakis as weak on defense, accusing the
Democrat of spreading ``misinformation'' about the state of U.S.
military forces.
   The Republican vice president, in remarks prepared for delivery
at a Martin Marietta defense contractor plant, said Dukakis is
``trying desperately to jump into the mainstream'' by acknowledging
a need to modernize land-based defenses.
   ``But there is strong reason to doubt that he would do it,
especially when it comes to modernizing our land-based missiles. He
still opposes the MX and he thinks the Midgetman costs too much. So
he says he's going to work with Congress to find another way.
   ``Wake up, governor, we've done all that,'' Bush said, adding
that in 1983 the bipartisan Scowcroft Commission was formed to
study national defense issues.
   Bush called on Dukakis to stop spreading what he called
``misinformation'' about the state of U.S. forces.
   ``It's not 1980 anymore. Our divisional war fighting
capabilities have improved by an average of 60 percent since
1980,'' Bush said. ``Notwithstanding my opponents' claims, only a
few of the A-6's are grounded because of wing cracks _ not one
third. We've got the money to fix them as fast as the manufacturer
can do it.
   ``Governor, it's time to stop running down our defenses,'' Bush
said.
   In his first news conference in more than two weeks, Bush said
Sunday that questions such as a query about his agenda for the
first 60 days in office ``are putting me beyond where I want to
be.''
   ``So if I don't answer some of them from here on in it is
because I'm focusing on November 8 and I don't want to be dragged
beyond that because things seem to be going well now,'' Bush said.
   The GOP nominee has a solid lead in many national polls and
Electoral College surveys.
   Bush enjoyed a low-key Sunday, joining family members at a
football game between the Denver Broncos and the Atlanta Falcons.
The vice president, who viewed the game from a private box, was
introduced at halftime to a mixture of cheers and boos.
   At the news conference, the GOP nominee declined to say what
budget cuts he would make to balance the budget, and was unspecific
when asked how he would deal with funding for the Nicaraguan rebels
and whether the homeless problem warrants special Cabinet-level
supervision.
   Bush said he already has a team studying the transition to a
Bush presidency and that he is ready to name his Cabinet quickly.
Former Navy Undersecretary Chase Untermeyer heads the Bush
transition team.
   ``He has drawn up wiring diagrams, what we should do if we
win,'' Bush said. ``You have to hit the ground running.''
   The vice president, however, scoffed at suggestions that he
already had decided on most of the Cabinet members he would choose.
   ``I can't let myself think about that. ... I'm not going to do
something that dumb and shift gears,'' Bush said.
   Referring to his escalating poll ratings since Thursday's
debate, he said, ``I can tell you I've been encouraged _ certainly
not one scintilla of overconfidence.''
   Bush did not disclose where he would make deficit-reducing
budget cuts, because that is something he will work out with
Congress when the times comes, according to his staff.
   ``You have to sit down and know the facts at the time,'' Bush
said at the news conference.
   On how he would handle the Contra situation in light of the
rebels' diminished military capacity, Bush said, ``I can't give you
what I'll do after I become president, but I'm a strong believer
that we made a big mistake, the Congress did, in not supporting the
resistance ... I would simply take a hard look when I got there,
see what the facts were at the time, and try to help the forces
that want democracy.''
   Bush said he would put his vice president in charge of a
national anti-drug program, but when asked what other duties he
would give him, Bush said only that it would be ``a wide area of
assignments based on the model of the last two administrations.''
   As to whether the homeless problem might merit special oversight
by the vice president, he replied: ``There's a lot of problems of
sufficient severity to require the attention of the president and
vice president. Whether that means setting up some special
operation, I couldn't possibly say.''
   Bush maintained that he can balance the budget by 1992 under his
``flexible freeze'' plan to limit federal spenfing to the rate of
inflation, with cuts off-setting each new spending item.
   He has listed some areas where he would spend more money,
including education, child care and cleaning up the environment,
but has refused to list cuts.
   Bush conceded that, for his idea to work, interest rates would
have to decline by several percentage points from current levels.

   Underdog Michael Dukakis, trying to reverse
his slide in pre-election polls, declared in the industrial Middle
West today that Republican rival George Bush ``sat on his hands
while America's industrial heartland has been fighting for its
life.''
   In a speech at the North Coast Brass and Copper Co., the
Democratic presidential nominee said that ``here in Ohio you've
lost thousands of manufacturing jobs. And just last week we learned
that we had more imports coming into the United States in August
than in any month in history.''
   Aides said that in the final three weeks of the campaign,
Dukakis would sharpen the differences between him and Bush,
particularly on economic issues.
   Dukakis arrived in Ohio shortly after publication of a new poll
by the Akron Beacon Journal which showed him trailing Bush in this
critical state by 11 points.
   Political aide Charles Baker dismissed the poll, saying the Ohio
electorate is ``volatile.''
   Ohio, he said, ``is winnable.'' Baker said Dukakis was spending
a full day in Ohio to be followed by a similar all-day foray into
Michigan.
   ``The sense is that you want to create a bigger impact on a
state by putting a lot of attention on it in one day,'' he said.
   Asked in which major states Dukakis is now trailing, Baker would
only reply, ``They're all competitive.''
   In his Euclid speech, Dukakis said that while Bush talks about
``a kinder, gentler nation,'' his record contradicts that message.
   ``His record tells the people of Ohio, `We don't care enough
about you to protect you from the nuclear weapons facilities that
are poisoning your water and threatening the safety of your
workers','' he said.
   ``And I`m here to tell you that in a Dukakis-Bentsen
administration, we'll have an Energy Department that makes sure
that its citizens and communities are never again threatened by
nuclear waste and deadly radioactive clouds,'' he said.
   On foreign trade, Dukakis said Bush ``has not given the American
people a clue as to what he would do. Mr. Bush's trade policy is
like a rerun of `Let's Make a Deal,' letting the voters guess
what's behind door No. 1, door No. 2 and door No. 3.''
   The Massachusetts governor said he would ``open the doors of
foreign markets to American products, because I want an America
more concerned with selling American goods abroad than selling
American debt abroad.''
   At a hometown rally in Boston on Sunday, Dukakis cast the Nov. 8
election as a contest between his middle-class work ethic and
penthouse Republicans who support Bush.
   ``I enter the last three weeks of this campaign as an underdog,
fighting for the values I believe in,'' he said.
   While the emphasis in Boston was on values, Dukakis aide Leslie
Dach said the Democratic nominee would concentrate on spelling out
``two different visions of our economic future'' during appearances
in Ohio, Michigan and Illinois over the next three days.
   ``The close of the campaign is going to be headed by a focus on
the economic issues,'' said Dach.
   Dukakis told supporters in historic Faneuil Hall, where leaders
of the American Revolution often met, that Republicans were
``already celebrating; they're popping champagne corks in their
penthouses. But I've got news for those Republicans; we're going to
be the ones celebrating on election night.''
   Emphasizing the differences between himself and Bush, the
Democratic nominee said, ``I believe in an America that's in
command of its destiny and takes charge of its future.''
   He said the vice president ``sat on the sidelines for eight
years while America got beaten in world markets, while they
mortgaged our children's future to a mountain of debt, and a piece
of America was being sold off every day at bargain basement
prices.''
   Said Dukakis: ``I believe America's leaders must strive to do
the right thing; but we must admit it _ and correct it _ when we do
the wrong thing. ... I've taken responsibility for my mistakes. But
Mr. Bush takes responsibility for nothing.''
   ``I believe in the value of work,'' said Dukakis, while Bush
``saw nothing, said nothing and did nothing while his Republican
colleagues in the Congress used every trick in the book to keep the
minimum wage a poverty wage.''
   ``Ask Mr. Bush,'' he went on ``if he can look a woman in the eye
who scrubs floors for a living to support her family on $3.35 an
hour.''
   Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich and Dach denied the
accuracy of a Washington Post story on Sunday that said he would
concentrate his efforts on 18 states and the District of Columbia
with 272 electoral votes _ two more than needed for election.
   The list contained most of the major states _ New York,
California, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania _ that both
sides describe as key battlegrounds.
   Also on the list were Minnesota, Massachusetts, Vermont,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland, West Virginia, the District of
Columbia, Iowa, Wisconsin, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii.
   Given lower priority, according to the Post, were Texas, home
state of Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen, and
New Jersey.
   ``It is not (accurate),'' said Estrich.
   ``We are not writing off whole regions of the country,'' she
said.
   She noted that while the story put Georgia and Louisiana among
the states being given less priority, Dukakis would be in both this
week.

<HEAD>Emperor in Serious But Stable Condition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito remained in serious but stable
condition Monday, nearly one month after suffering internal
bleeding, palace officials said.
   Hirohito, 87, fell ill Sept. 19, and has been bedridden since.
   ``The emperor as usual is fully conscious,'' said Kenji Maeda,
spokesman for the Imperial Household Agency.
   Doctors gave Hirohito nearly a half-pint of blood Monday. Since
Sept. 19, he has received more than 18 pints to replace the blood
lost and to combat anemia.
   The Imperial Household Agency has released little information
about the nature of his illness beyond releasing his temperature
and pulse and respiration rates three times daily and the amount of
blood Hirohito has received.
   News reports have said the emperor has pancreatic cancer. The
agency has neither confirmed nor denied the reports and has urged
the media to refrain from such speculation.
   Hirohito has no political power but serves as a symbol of
national unity.

<HEAD>TV Ads Help Bush Pull Even With Dukakis in Big-Prize California</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In just 60 seconds, George Bush transformed
his prospects in California from a potential landslide loss to
Democrat Michael Dukakis into a dead-heat battle for the state's 47
electoral votes, the biggest prize in the presidential election.
   That magic minute for Bush was comprised of two 30-second
television commercials _ one attacking Dukakis for pollution in
Boston Harbor, the other focusing on the Massachusetts program
permitting furloughs for prison inmates.
   Before those commercials began airing on TV stations throughout
the state, Dukakis held a strong, often double-digit, lead over
Bush among California voters in public opinion polls.
   The Massachusetts governor had been scoring heavily with strong
attacks on the Reagan-Bush administration's environmental record
and with speeches linking the vice president to Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, whom Dukakis described as a ``drug-running Panamanian
dictator.''
   But since the Bush campaign began its Boston Harbor and crime
commercials, the gap between the two candidates has narrowed in the
nation's largest state.
   Dukakis has counterattacked with a commercial contending that
``it was Bush's administration that cut funds to clean up Boston
Harbor.'' The spot accused the administration of cutting money
allocated to clean up the California coast as well.
   ``So when you hear George Bush talk about the environment,
remember what he did to the environment,'' the commercial
concludes. Dukakis has the support of major environmental
organizations in California.
   The lure of this state's 47 electoral votes _ nearly one-sixth
of the 270 needed for election on Nov. 8 _ has brought the state a
steady stream of campaign visits and an avalanche of money.
   ``California is an integral part of nearly every winning
scenario,'' said Dukakis campaign communications director Leslie
Dach.
   Dukakis has spent 10 days in California since Labor Day and will
be in the state at least six more days before Election Day.
   Bush has been in the state nine days over the same period and
also will return before the election. He can expect determined help
here from his chief campaign surrogate, President Reagan, who was
twice elected governor of California.
   Steve Hopcraft, spokesman for Dukakis' state campaign, said at
least $10 million would be spent in California boosting the
Democratic nominee's election.
   Bush campaign aides were unable to supply a figure, but there
seemed little doubt that the vice president's backers also were
spending millions in the state.
   ``We've been sitting in a dead heat for a couple of weeks now,''
said Bill Lacy, who is directing the Bush effort in California.
   ``We are ahead in this state,'' claims Tony Podesta, Lacy's
counterpart with the Dukakis campaign. But if the Massachusetts
governor is leading, it is by the narrowest of margins.
   The most recent public poll said Dukakis was leading by 4 points.
   No state polling data has been available since the final
presidential debate was held in Los Angeles on Oct. 13, but
national surveys said Bush was given the edge in that confrontation.
   Both campaigns are working hard to build grass-roots
organizations capable of getting out the vote for their candidates.
   Hopcraft said the Dukakis campaign was making 30,000 telephone
contacts nightly to recruit volunteers, and would have a leader in
each of the state's 23,617 precincts by Election Day.
   Lacy said Bush phone banks have contacted 600,000 voters. The
Bush campaign also has the benefit of Republican Gov. George
Deukmejian's statewide organization.
   Lacy said California was ``too big to be organized simply as
another state.'' As a result, he said, the Bush campaign has carved
it into four distinct regions. They are the Republican heartland in
such southern counties as Orange and Ventura, the heavily
Democratic San Francisco Bay area, less heavily Democratic Los
Angeles County and rural areas that are proving to be an important
battleground in this race.
   During Bush's most recent appearances on a bus tour of the
central valley, he kept up his attacks on Dukakis as a liberal out
of step with mainstream America.
   ``When you hear those liberals talk, the 11 most feared words in
the English language are `I'm from the federal government and I'm
here to help you','' Bush told a rally in Stockton. ``The American
people don't believe that.''
   Before a Hispanic audience in Pasadena, Dukakis labeled the
attacks ``cynical'' and accused the Reagan administration and the
vice president of ignoring the concerns of the poor and middle
class.
   ``We can't take four years of that, we can't take four days of
that,'' he said.
   When speaking to Hispanics, Dukakis often lapses into Spanish,
which invariably gets a strong positive response. Hispanics are a
fast-growing part of the California electorate but their election
turnout is lower than among other groups of voters.

   Fire broke out aboard a Soviet passenger liner
carrying French tourists on a cruise of the Mediterranean, but the
blaze was put out by the crew and no passengers were injured, Tass
reported Monday.
   The Shota Rustaveli was 25 miles off the island of Malta when a
blaze broke out in the auxiliary engine room, the official news
agency said.
   ``The blaze was put out by the crew. There are no casualties
among the passengers,'' Tass said.
   It cited local news reports as saying the ship had docked at the
Maltese port of Valletta, and that its passengers had been offered
sightseeing trips around the island south of Sicily.
   The tourists were expected to continue their voyage on another
Soviet ship, and the crew of the Shota Rustaveli was to make
repairs and bring the ship home, Tass said.
   It was the second fire aboard a Soviet cruise ship in recent
months. On May 18, a blaze broke out on the liner Priamurye while
it was in the Japanese port of Osaka. Eleven Soviets were killed in
the Priamurye fire, and 26 others hospitalized in critical
condition, Tass reported. The ship was carrying 295 Soviets on a
youth cruise around Japan.

   The liberal-leaning Asahi Shimbun of Tokyo said Monday that
Thursday's debate between Republican Vice President George Bush and
Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts ``lacked meat.''
   ``Bush merely reiterated that he would not raise taxes and
indicated no convincing measure for reducing America's `twin
deficits' that have been affecting not only the U.S. economy but
the global economy as well. And Dukakis ... failed to explain how
he intended to fund his ambitious welfare policy.
   ``We found it most unfortunate that what we consider a
`mud-slinging contest' _ believed to have been started by the Bush
camp _ escalated in this debate and consequently blurred more
important policy issues. And Dukakis, who is said to be faltering,
apparently tried to recover his ground by pushing harsher measures
against U.S. trading partners and foreign investors as a means for
winning voter approval. We were alarmed and disturbed by this.''

   Vittorio Zucconi, reporting from Washington for the liberal

   Ennio Caretto, reporting from Washington for the moderate

the unknown factor of the Reagan inheritance, to make it recapture
the taste of combat and change.''

   Siegmund Ginzberg, reporting from New York for the Rome-based
Communist Party newspaper l'Unita, wrote that Bush won the debate
``not with a TKO but with boring technique.''
   ``Bush, magisterially prepared by his directors, turned out to
be, even in presenting himself with an unchanging `manly look,'
capable of touching the sentimental feelings of the public. Dukakis
instead turned out to appear like an iceberg, detached and
identifying himself with the image of a `computer without a

   The Roman Catholic daily Ya of Madrid said Saturday in an
editorial that Bush was leading after the debate. It lauded Bush
for upholding the legacy of President Reagan, including economic
growth and national prestige.
   ``What can Dukakis offer to confront this? The commentators ...
have concentrated on his qualities as a brilliant, intuitive man
along Kennedyesque intellectual lines. But they have forgotten that
these qualities, fascinating to Europeans, are not irresistible to
American voters who mainly look to their government leaders for
security, efficacy and consistency, qualities Bush has in good
supply. In addition, Dukakis is no Kennedy.''

   In Jakarta, the pro-government Bisnis Indonesia newspaper
editorialized Saturday that Bush and Dukakis brought up no new

   ``A number of people in Jakarta watching the debate ... saw that
Dukakis was not as aggressive as during the first debate. He looked
much more calmer and polite. ... Bush took every opportunity to
brand his opponent as a liberal.
   ``Many Indonesians _ especially exporters _ hope that Bush will
win so that the American door remains open to their products.''

   Actor and animal lover Ed Asner gave a sendoff
to about 190 people with dogs before a three-mile walk to raise
money for a program that puts dogs into nursing homes as therapy
for the elderly and disabled.
   Asner, who is appearing in a production of ``Born Yesterday'' at

Sterling the cat, a regular ambassador for Pets On Wheels.
   ``I can imagine the joy you bring into the hearts and minds of

   Action for Soviet Jewry presented Kennedy, D-Mass., with its
Freedom Award for lobbying the Kremlin on behalf of such Soviet
emigrees as Benjamin Charny and Yuri Zieman.
   The senator told an awards banquet Sunday he is encouraged by
the recent emigration of Soviet Jews, but is cautious about
indications that several stumbling blocks to emigration may soon be
dropped.
   ``There is some reason to hope that the Soviets will finally
open the gates of emigration and end the harsh persecution of their
Jewish citizens,'' Kennedy said in prepared remarks.
   ``But nothing is certain, and as long as teachers of Hebrew are
arrested, as long as books of Jewish learning are confiscated, as
long as innocent human beings are persecuted because of their
belief in the God of their fathers, none of us can be silent or

   Queen Elizabeth arrived Monday on the
first-ever visit of a reigning British monarch to Spain with just
one obstacle clouding the horizon: the Rock of Gibraltar.
   The Queen was met at the airport by two relatives, Crown Prince
Felipe and Princess Elena, and drove with them and the Duke of
Edinburgh through streets decked with red and yellow Spanish flags
and red, blue and white Union Jacks to El Pardo Palace, the
residence for state guests, on the outskirts of Madrid.
   There she was received with full military honors by her third
cousin, King Juan Carlos, Queen Sofia and members of the government
of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
   The five-day tour, which includes trips to Seville and Barcelona
and two private days on the Mediterranean island of Majorca, is
being hailed by the Spanish press as the final step in the
normalization of relations between the two countries that began
with Juan Carlos' visit to Britain in April 1986 and has been
coaxed along by members of Europe's two most important royal
families.
   The 62-year-old British monarch and the 50-year-old Spanish king
are third cousins through Britain's Queen Victoria.
   Press and radio commentators have noted that Britain is the only
country in the world with which Spain still maintains a major
dispute _ sovereignty over Gibraltar.
   The Rock was ceded to Britain by treaty in 1713 when Spain lost
the War of Spanish Succession.
   The Queen and Juan Carlos were expected to talk about Gibraltar,
but ``this will not be a political discussion, of course,'' said a
British source who asked to remain anonymous.

<HEAD>First Lady Borrowed and Returned Gowns, Press Secretary Says</HEAD>

   Nancy Reagan has borrowed and returned
expensive gowns and other clothing used for official functions, but
nothing in the government ethics laws required disclosure of these
transactions, her press secretary said today.
   Responding to a story in the Oct. 24 issue of Time magazine,
spokeswoman Elaine Crispen confirmed that the first lady had been
lent gowns since 1982. White House lawyers agreed in 1982 that any
borrowed dresses should be considered as loans and reported.
   ``I don't think the law (Ethics in Government Act of 1978)
required for those gowns to be reported,'' Mrs. Crispen said.
``They have all been returned.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked earlier to comment
on the Time report, said that President Reagan was ``very upset
about all these attacks'' on the first lady.
   Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman denied that the first lady had kept
any of the numerous dresses and matched outfits loaned to her by
designers.
   Time said neither the disclosure forms nor Reagan tax returns
from 1982 through 1987 listed loans or gifts of dresses to Mrs.
Reagan, and Mrs. Crispen did not deny that there had been no such
disclosures. She said there had been earlier disclosures, but that
it was subsequently decided that they were not required in
instances where dresses were returned.
   ``To a typical woman, there are some gowns that are so
spectacular that you would only wear it once,'' she said in a
telephone interview. ``Forget to report them? I don't know. ... I
do know that there was no law broken.''
   Mrs. Crispen said that there were some disclosures in 1981
because it was decided to list the dresses borrowed, even though
officials did not believe it was required, just to allay any doubt
about the transactions.
   The spokeswoman had said last week that Mrs. Reagan told her she
has bought all the clothes she has worn since early 1982, according
to the magazine. Today, Mrs. Crispen amended that to say that ``she
considers her personal wardrobe to have been bought. There have
been things that have been borrowed _ and returned _ since 1982.''
   When asked whether an internal inquiry had been commenced in the
White House counsel's office to determine the validity of the
assertions about Mrs. Reagan's use of clothes, Fitzwater replied,
``No. At this point, I don't know that there's any need for one.''
   Los Angeles designer David Hayes said Mrs. Reagan has borrowed
60 to 80 made-to-order outfits during the past eight years. She
returned more than half and kept the others, he said.
   ``We think of it as loans. It's wonderful,'' Hayes told Time.
``She has been a sensation for my business.''
   An unidentified executive at Harry Winston jewelers in New York
City told Time that Mrs. Reagan continued to borrow expensive
accessories, including a pair of diamond earrings worth $800,000.
   Mrs. Crispen said today that Mrs. Reagan on two occasions
borrowed jewelry from Harry Winston jewelers _ for the 1981
presidential inaugural and for the wedding of Prince Charles and
Lady Diana later that year.
   Chris Blazakis, who works with designer James Galanos and is
writing a book about the Reagans, said he has identified more than
300 photographs since 1982 showing Mrs. Reagan wearing outfits he
estimates are worth a total of more than $1 million retail.
   In November 1981, Mrs. Reagan disclosed she had been accepting
clothing as gifts. On Jan. 14, 1982, she announced that she would
consider dresses accepted in 1981 as loans, and would select the
best and give them to 13 museums.
   According to Time, the museums report that the last such
donation was in 1982.
   Mrs. Crispen said there have been no such museum donations since
then because Mrs. Reagan returned the dresses to the designers.

<TEXT>
   Environmentalists can point to some successes
in the soon-to-end 100th Congress, although efforts to reach
compromises to strengthen the Clean Air Act proved once again to be
elusive.
   Congress enacted legislation to improve the Endangered Species
Act, switch the nation's vehicles to alternative fuels and launch
campaigns against indoor pollution from radon gas and to control
increasing amounts of improperly discarded medical waste.
   But gathering dust along with the clean air bill were proposals
to give the Environmental Protection Agency more clout over
hazardous waste generated by other federal agencies and to set
ground rules for disposing of ash from growing numbers of municipal
incinerators.
   Also left undone was one of the Reagan administration's more
controversial land-use proposals to the 100th Congress, a plan to
allow petroleum development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
   Environmentally, the 100th Congress began in January 1987 with a
fiscal battle against the White House over the future of the Clean
Water Act, the law credited with improving the quality of many of
America's waterways.
   A 1986 bill to give local governments $18 billion through 1994
to build waste water and sewage treatment facilities had been
pocket-vetoed as too costly by President Reagan after the 99th
Congress adjourned.
   By huge majorities in both chambers, the 100th quickly sent the
same bill to the president, who was trying to cut the funding to
$12 billion and vetoed the package a second time.
   Republicans deserted the White House in droves as the House
voted 401-26 and the Senate 86-14 to override the second veto.
There was a major element of pork-barrel in the outcome: every
state and virtually every district was in line for a share of the
money.
   While this fight occurred on the front lines, the struggle over
the clean air bill took place in the trenches, with neither the
House nor Senate able to bring a proposal to the floor for debate.
   Led by Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, the Environment Committee
drafted an ambitious package to attack urban smog, acid rain and
airborne toxic chemicals. The administration opposed major portions
of it, and the bill's depth and breadth brought it a wide variety
of industry foes.
   Mitchell spent much of 1988 trying to unite diverse economic and
regional interests but abandoned efforts in early October, saying
there was a lack of will to compromise among the environmental and
industry lobbies.
   On the House side, a clean air bill never came up for a vote in
the Energy and Commerce Committee despite efforts by middle-ground
members to bring together environmentalist Henry Waxman, D-Calif.,
and chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., who opposed Waxman's plan to
clean up auto emissions.
   While deadlocked on low-level air pollution, committees on both
sides of the Capitol were raising their sights with a series of
hearings on global warming, the greenhouse effect that scientists
say threatens the planet with climate changes and rising sea levels.
   Legislation was introduced in both chambers to begin clamping
down on the greenhouse gases that are trapping the sun's heat in
the atmosphere. More hearings are planned for the 101st Congress,
which will be looking to the new president to exercise leadership
against a global environmental threat.
   On another global issue, the Senate this year ratified the
international agreement to reduce emissions of chlorofluorocarbons,
the chemicals said to be destroying the Earth's vital ozone layer.
   The 1987 agreement was largely the result of a worldwide
diplomatic effort by the Reagan administration, which for nearly
eight years has fought Congress on many proposals to improve the
domestic environment.
   One exception was the joint work by the administration and
Congress on the recently passed bill to combat radon, the naturally
occurring gas that seeps into buildings and is described as second
only to cigarette smoking as a cause of lung cancer.
   The bill sets a long-term goal of having indoor air as free of
radon concentrations as the air outdoors. It would authorize $30
million to help states set up radon control programs, require EPA
to survey schools for radon and mandate standards for radon
abatement contractors.
   One of the potentially far-reaching acts of the 100th Congress
was a plan to switch cars, trucks and buses away from gasoline to
alternative fuels made from coal, natural gas and grain.
   The legislation attempts to wean the nation away from petroleum
imports by giving automakers incentives to produce the vehicles
that are necessary to spur production of alternatives to gasoline.
   Responding to increasing reports of medical waste washing up on
shorelines, Congress recently passed legislation to require EPA to
set up controls to track this sometimes dangerous trash.
   The initial program would be geared to Connecticut, New Jersey
and the eight states bordering the Great Lakes. It could, however,
become national in scope because any other state could ask to be
included.

   Fires threatened a wildlife sanctuary and
burned closer to a grove of centuries-old giant sequoia trees today
as three major blazes burned in California's heartland and near
home-studded mountain ridges surrounding Los Angeles.
   The fires fanned by 30 mph gusts erupted during the weekend as
an autumn heat wave blasted California with temperatures near 100
degrees in some areas.
   Flames burned through more than 4,000 acres by this morning in
the three large blazes and two smaller blazes. The largest fire, a
2,000-plus acre blaze in the Angeles National Forest, challenged
firefighters trying to protect homes about 30 miles north of Los
Angeles.
   ``We'll either catch it, or we'll chase it,'' said Los Angeles
County firefighter Stan Pearson. ``It's burning some areas that
haven't burned in a real long, long time.''
   The fire, raging through Placerita Canyon north of Sylmar, sent
a plume of smoke 7,000 feet high, and two firefighters suffered
minor injuries battling the blaze, authorities said. The smoke was
visible 50 miles away at Los Angeles International Airport and at
Dodger Stadium during Sunday's Game 2 of the World Series.
   The fire moved closer through the night to homes on the
northeast rim of the San Fernando Valley, but no evacuations were
ordered, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Kim Vanderhaar said.
``They can look out their back yards and see the fire,'' she said.
   Flames pushing to within a mile of the Wildlife Way Station
worried workers at the non-profit refuge for more than 1,000 wild
animals, said spokeswoman Martine Colette, adding it was an
unusally quiet night at the compound.
   ``The lions stopped roaring and the coyotes stopped howling.
They can smell the fire and they are extremely quiet because of
it,'' she said. A dozen water tankers surrounded the facility at
dawn.
   ``We will have to make our stand here. It would not be feasible
to evacuate the animals,'' she said.
   More than 500 firefighters worked through the night to turn the
blaze as it burned dry brush in highly inaccessible mountainous
terrain, Pearson said.
   Swirling winds sent flames in three different directions,
compounding the effort, he said.
   Three Los Angeles men accused of starting the blaze with an
illegal campfire were jailed on $2,500 bail, said Sheriff's Lt. Ed
Chenal. He said the blaze appeared accidental.
   In Sequoia National Park, a 1,000-acre fire burned near trees
more than 2,000 years old in the three-square-mile Giant Forest was
met by nearly 500 firefighters, said U.S. Forest Service
spokeswoman Michele Case.
   A successful backfire set to broaden a buffer around the grove
of what are considered the largest living things on Earth gave
officials hope the area around the majestic trees would not be
burned, she said.
   But the giant sequoias themselves are considered relatively
immune from fires because their bark doesn't burn easily, and
because their branches are so far above the ground, experts said.
   About 100 campers fled the flames that broke out Sunday morning
in the Potwisha Camp Ground about 30 miles northeast of Visalia and
175 miles north of Los Angeles.
   The fire was blamed on a careless camper, Ms. Case said.
   An 800-acre brush fire in Riverside County near Hemet burned out
of control about 85 miles southeast of Los Angeles, but
firefighters were gaining the upper hand and predicted control
later today, said California Department of Forestry spokeswoman
Joanne Evans.
   Two smaller fires erupted in the mountainous eastern portion of
the Angeles National Forest. One, a 55-acre blaze started by
children playing with matches and a cigarette lighter, destroyed a
house before it was extinguished. Firefighters were keeping the
other one, a 150-acre fire, from crossing a ridge this morning but
had not contained it, authorities said.

<HEAD>Former Reagan Aide Linda Chavez Quits U.S. English Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House aide Linda Chavez said today
she is quitting as president of U.S. English after being told that
at least one major contributor to the group has advocated forced
sterilization.
   ``I am resigning,'' she said. ``To me, it is just not consistent
with the views I hold.''
   Veteran CBS newsman Walter Cronkite resigned from the group's
advisory board last week after being told of a 1986 memo by U.S.
English Chairman John Tanton that raised the spectre of the United
States becoming overwhelmed by foreign-speaking have-nots.
   Ms. Chavez, the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate from
Maryland in 1986 and a former aide in the Reagan administration,
told The Associated Press last week that she might follow suit if
Tanton did not step down following a weekend board meeting.
   On Monday, she said she had since learned that at least one
major contributor had helped reprint ``an awful, awful book''
called ``Coup of the Saints'' which she described as ``a paranoid
fantasy'' about ``undesirables of the Third World'' taking over
developed nations.
   At least one major contributor has given money to ``groups that
may be involved in eugenics research,'' she added.
   Ms. Chavez did not identify the contributor or contributors
about whom she was speaking but said she asked Tanton whether he
knew of the contributors' other activities. He told her he wasn't
aware of them.
   A proposition bankrolled by U.S. English that is on the Arizona
ballot next month would change the Arizona Constitution to
designate English as the state's official language and limit
government use of foreign languages in courts, meetings and schools.
   Similar measures are on the ballot in Colorado and Florida.
   Ms. Chavez said she had planned to leave the group anyway
following the weekend board meeting but decided after hearing about
the contributors that ``I don't feel that I wish to wait until
other details are worked out.''
   At their meeting in Alexandria, Va., the U.S. English board of
directors decided to review Tanton's activities in
immigration-reform and population-control groups and his 1986 memo
before taking any action.
   Tanton did not immediately return a call seeking comment, and an
operator at U.S. English in Washington said no one else was
available.
   Ms. Chavez said she had sought assurances about the type of
backers the organization had before she joined it and had given up
administrative control of U.S. English several weeks ago because
the organization's financial records weren't being kept in
Washington.
   ``I feel that there were some misrepresentations made,'' she
said in a telephone interview from her home in Maryland.
   In Phoenix, a spokesman for opponents of the ballot proposition
said word of her resignation would help his efforts.
   ``This resignation confirms what we have been saying,'' said
spokesman Perry Baker. ``It is hard for anyone to support John
Tanton and Proposition 106 when the facts are known. One shadowy
figure from Michigan is pushing his grisly vision upon the people
of Arizona.''
   Ms. Chavez said she still supported the idea behind U.S. English
and believed the proposition could stand on its own merit no matter
who supported or opposed it.
   Supporters of Proposition 106 say it would unify the state and
help minorities join the mainstream more quickly. Critics claim it
would disrupt the operation of civil courts, English-proficiency
classes, tourism and commerce with other countries.

   Boy Scout leaders seeking to ward off child
molesters are telling their troops in a ``yell and tell'' campaign
that it's okay for a Scout to be rude and even to holler ``no'' if
someone tries to do something wrong.
   The assertiveness training is part of a nationwide Youth
Protection Training program unveiled this year by the Boy Scouts of
America.
   ``We know that perverted individuals seek out youth
organizations such as Scouts, choirs and teams. What we have done
is sharpen our scrutiny and make the Boy Scouts of America very
uncomfortable for pedophiles,'' said Bill Kephart, Denver area
scouting director.
   In his eight years as executive director of Denver scouting
headquarters, Kephart said he had heard only four official
complaints of molestation. In 24 years of scouting work before that
he recalls only one complaint, he said.
   But Ted Accus, spokesman for the Boy Scouts national
headquarters in Irving, Texas, said at least 100 official
accusations of sexual assault have been registered in the past
decade nationwide. The program has 1.5 million leaders operating
each year.
   In the past year, Explorer Scout posts in the Denver area have
been involved in two sexual assault cases.
   A former Douglas County sheriff's deputy was sentenced in May to
nine years in prison for sexual assault on a minor. Three Scouts
testified he used his position to gain their trust and manipulated
their loyalty to seduce them.
   Last month a former Explorer Scout accused a Cherry Hills
Village patrolman of sexually abusing her in 1984. The case has not
yet come to trial.
   Kephart has scheduled a Youth Protection workshop Oct. 22 for
leaders of nearly 150 metro-area Explorer Scout Posts.
   Effective last month, anyone wanting to become a Boy Scout
leader must submit an application that lists any drug, child abuse
or other felony charges.
   Scouting adminstrators also are teaching leaders to avoid being
accused, Kephart said.
   ``At one time, Scout leaders counseling a kid could shut the
door and sit down to talk with him. But now we tell them not to get
alone with Scouts,'' Kephart said.
   In addition to the ban on one-on-one contact, new rules require
that at least two supervising adults accompany outings such as
campouts.
   ``It is a great dilemma,'' Kephart said. ``There are plenty of
kids out there who really need an arm around their shoulder and
some affection. I don't really think that hugging is completely out.
   ``But if I want to put an arm around a Scout who has done well,
I do it in public and standing in the middle of the room.''

<HEAD>Philippines Bases Pact Finalized</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top 6 grafs new with final details of pact agreed on; picks
up 5th graf pvs, Clark and Subic.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

   Final agreement was reached today on a
military pact between the United States and the Philippines that
ensures continued U.S. use of crucial Pacific air and naval bases
while boosting American aid to the Asian nation.
   ``It is a very important achievement,'' said Charles E. Redman,
the State Department spokesman.
   He said the agreement would be signed later today by Secretary
of State George P. Shultz and Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus.
   Negotiators for the two governments worked on final details
until a few hours before the ceremony. ``We have reached basic
agreement,'' Redman announced, saying no details would be left over
for negotiators to grapple with later.
   The agreement covers use of the two largest U.S. military
outposts abroad __ Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Navy Base _ and
four smaller installations.
   On Sunday, Manglus said the pact included $481 million in annual
payments, other U.S. concessions, an agreement on nuclear weapons
and U.S. backing for a bond program aimed at reducing the
Philippines' $28 billion debt.
   Clark and Subic are considered vital to regional and Western
security interests across a wide part of the world stretching from
the Pacific to the Persian Gulf.
   The agreement falls far short of the $1.2 billion that
Philippine sources say Manglapus originally wanted. Manglapus,
however, said U.S. and Philippine officials were never far apart on
actual cash compensation in talks that began in April in Manila. He
said their disagreements were over U.S. failure to approve benefits
and concessions that would not require congressional approval.
   For five years, the Philippines has been receiving $180 million
in annual military and economic aid tied to the bases. Additional
U.S. aid has boosted the total to more than $450 million a year
since Philippine President Corazon Aquino took power in February
1986.
   Mrs. Aquino announced Sunday that the signing ceremonies would
take place in Washington. She gave no details and U.S. State
Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck said during the weekend only that
U.S. officials hoped for a conclusion of the agreement today. A
U.S.-Philippines working group continued to iron out technical
details on Sunday.
   Manglapus, however, disclosed the broad scope of the agreement
in a telephone interview.
   The pact is expected to lead to talks next year on the long-term
future of the bases, which many Filipinos want removed after the
lease lapses in 1991. Mrs. Aquino has not said whether she supports
U.S. use of the bases after 1991. Any new treaty would have to be
approved by a two-thirds vote of the Philippine Senate and a
possible referendum.
   Failure to conclude the bases review, originally scheduled for
July, has delayed Reagan administration endorsement of a $5 billion
multilateral aid program proposed by two Republican and two
Democratic members of Congress. White House sources have said
President Reagan backs the plan, but it could not be set up until
the amount of the base compensation was set.
   U.S. officials have not said what the U.S. share of the
so-called ``mini-Marshall Plan'' would be, but Philippine
government sources have said $300 million annually has been
discussed, with a like amount expected from Japan and the rest from
other countries.
   Manglapus said that while the multinational aid plan is separate
from the bases, a new debt-relief portion of the bases pact will
allow more help from other countries to come in the form of direct
aid rather than debt relief.
   The bases-linked debt-relief plan is a complex arrangement,
calling for the United States to put up U.S. Treasury bonds that
would back a Philippine bond issue that initially would be
exchanged for outstanding debts at 50 cents on the dollar,
Manglapus said.
   He said the value of the plan to the country would depend on the
bond market. Philippine officials previously said they would ask
that the United States put up $100 million in U.S. Treasury bonds
to back a Philippine bond issue.
   Manglapus said one Philippine proposal was to have this come
from the first installment of the U.S. share in the multinational
aid plan. But he said U.S. officials agreed to an even more
beneficial arrangement, with the money coming from stepped up
payments of delayed fiscal 1988 and 1989 aid that previously could
not be used to pay off the debt.
   Manglapus, who came to Washington after he and U.S. Ambassador
Nicholas Platt failed to reach agreement in Manila, said a U.S.
pledge to give the Philippines title to all improvements on U.S.
facilities at the bases is ``an important concession.''
   The bases were deeded to the Philippines under a previous
agreement but are used by U.S. troops under the pact.
   Manglapus declined to give details of a nuclear weapons
agreement he said was in the documents being signed.
   The Philippine Senate has voted to ban nuclear weapons, but
officials in Aquino's government have interpreted the law to allow
the president the last word on whether exceptions might be made in
the national interest. With Aquino's agreement, this could allow
the United States to continue its policy of neiher confirming nor
denying the location of nuclear armaments.
   During the politically charged negotiations in Manila, Manglapus
said the bases were not necessary for Philippine security, and U.S.
officials said they could be moved if the Philippines demanded too
much compensation.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis on the Attack With 3 Weeks to Go</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 25th graf, Meanwhile, to show St. Petersburg
newspaper recommends Dukakis rather than Bush</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Attacking vigorously with just over three weeks to the election,
George Bush said today his Democratic rival should ``stop running
down our defenses,'' while Michael Dukakis said Bush doesn't care
enough about people to protect them from nuclear-poisoned water.
   Far from conceding the presidential race is over, despite polls
showing Bush with a lead, the two contenders were out campaigning
early and hard as the week began.
   Dukakis, seeking votes in Ohio, one of the states it is now
clear he must win to have a chance on Election Day, said that Bush
as vice president has ``sat on his hands while America's industrial
heartland has been fighting for its life.''
   ``Here in Ohio you've lost thousands of manufacturing jobs. And
just last week we learned that we had more imports coming into the
United States in August than in any month in history,'' Dukakis
said.
   He also said that while Bush talks about ``a kinder, gentler
nation,'' his record contradicts that message.
   ``His record tells the people of Ohio, `We don't care enough
about you to protect you from the nuclear weapons facilities that
are poisoning your water and threatening the safety of your
workers,''' Dukakis said.
   Bush, meanwhile, resumed his attack on Dukakis as weak on
defense.
   In remarks prepared for delivery at a Denver defense plant, Bush
said Dukakis is ``trying desperately to jump into the mainstream''
by talking of a need to modernize land-based defenses.
   ``But there is strong reason to doubt that he would do it,
especially when it comes to modernizing our land-based missiles,''
he said.
   Bush added, ``It's time the liberal governor stopped spreading
what I'll call charitably `misinformation' about the state of our
forces. It's not 1980 any more. Our divisional war fighting
capabilities have improved by an average of 60 percent sine 1980.''
   A day earlier, Bush cautioned against overconfidence and
promised to stick to his campaign course, while Dukakis, facing an
uphill struggle in the presidential race, nevertheless predicted
victory on Election Day.
   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle echoed Bush's
sentiments today, saying at a campaign stop in Flint, Mich.,
``We're going to run like we're 10 points behind.''
   The vice president, buoyed by polls showing him widening his
lead over Dukakis, said Sunday that his presidential transition
team, headed by former Navy Undersecretary Chase Untermeyer, is
already at work and that he will be ready to name his Cabinet
quickly.
   ``He has drawn up wiring diagrams, what we should do if we
win,'' Bush said. ``You have to hit the ground running.''
   But the GOP nominee, in his first news conference in more than
two weeks, dismissed suggestions that he has already decided on the
Cabinet members he would choose.
   ``I can't let myself think about that ... I'm not going to do
something that dumb and shift gears,'' Bush told reporters in
Denver where he said his campaign will ``keep on with our original
game plan, keep working hard, keep traveling to key states... keep
moving forward.''
   ``All I know is to just drive down to the wire,'' he said.
   Dukakis, encouraged by a warm reception from hometown supporters
in Boston's historic Faneuil Hall, described himself as the
campaign's underdog, but warned Republicans about toasting success
three weeks before the election.
   The GOP is ``already celebrating; they're popping champagne
corks in their penthouses,'' the Massachusetts governor said. ``But
I've got news for those Republicans; we're going to be the ones
celebrating on Election Night.''
   On Sunday, Bush promised to follow his campaign strategy with
the focus on Election Day _ not Inauguration Day, and deflected
questions about his presidential agenda.
   ``I can tell you I've been encouraged _ certainly not one
scintilla of overconfidence,'' said Bush.
   Questioned about possible budget cuts to reduce the deficit and
additional aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, Bush responded: ``I'm
having trouble with these questions because they are putting me
beyond where I want to be. So if I don't answer some of them from
here on in it is because I'm focusing on November 8 and I don't
want to be dragged beyond that because things seem to be going well
now.''
   On the budget question, Bush said that he will work it out with
Congress when the time comes. ``You have to sit down and know the
facts at the time,'' he said.
   And on aid to the Contra rebels, Bush said, ``I can't give you
what I'll do after I become president, but I'm a strong believer
that we made a big mistake, the Congress did, in not supporting the
resistance.''
   Meanwhile, Dukakis picked up the editorial support of the St.
Petersburg (Fla.) Times, which recommends candidates rather than
endorses them, while Bush was backed by three Ohio newspapers _ The
Columbus Dispatch, The Cincinnati Enquirer and The Elyria
Chronicle-Telegram.
   In his Sunday appearance, Dukakis cast the election as a battle
between the work ethic of the middle class and the rich Republicans
who support Bush.
   ``I believe in the value of work,'' the Democratic nominee said.
``(Bush) saw nothing, said nothing and did nothing while his
Republican colleagues in the Congress used every trick in the book
to keep the minimum wage at poverty level.''
   ``Ask Mr. Bush,'' Dukakis added, ``if he can look a woman in the
eye who scrubs floors for a living to support her family on $3.35
an hour.''
   Dukakis described himself as an ``underdog, fighting for the
values I believe in.''

   A motorist involved in a fatal head-on
traffic collision committed suicide at the scene while medics were
treating people injured in the wreck, police said.
   An autopsy completed Sunday showed that Ronald Paquette, 42, of
Plymouth, shot himself in the head, police said. They declined to
speculate on a motive.
   State Police Capt. Ernest Loomis said blood tests had not been
completed on Paquette. Loomis said he had several drunken driving
convictions.
   Loomis said Paquette apparently tried to pass several cars on a
two-lane highway and struck an oncoming car Saturday evening.
   Loomis said Paquette turned a pistol on himself while sitting
alone in his car as medical attendants were treating people injured
in the other car. State police also were nearby. One person in the
other car was killed.
   Paquette had been treated minutes earlier for multiple head and
chest injuries that were not life-threatening, Loomis said.

   A Japanese man who works for a trading company
forced four other Monopoly players into bankruptcy Monday to win
the eighth world championship in a record, 2\-hour final.
   ``Most pleased!'' said Ikuo Hiyakuta, gasping for breath after
his victory. ``I really wanted to win. I was determined.''
   The 36-year-old from Chiba City, Japan, defeated Chen Shabtai,
13, of Israel, to win $15,140 in cash, the same amount that comes
in each Monopoly set.
   The final game, in which five players competed, was the longest
of the eight championships held so far, organizers said. The game
ends when one person has forced everyone else into bankruptcy.
   Hiyakuta has been playing Monopoly seriously for four years and
is Japan's national champion.
   The runners-up, who each won $1,000, were Shabtai; Roger Edblom,
17, of Sweden; Carmen Arroyo, 28, of Puerto Rico; and Tony Andrews,
37, of New Zealand.
   Thirty players from 29 countries participated in the two-day
event.
   On Sunday, all the contestants played three, 90-minute rounds in
groups of five. The players who finished with the most money
advanced to the final.
   The championships are held every three years.
   Monopoly was developed by Charles B. Darrow of Germantown, Pa.,
and he sold the rights to U.S. based Parker Brothers in 1935. The
game has been translated into 19 languages and about 100 million
sets have been sold worldwide.
   A Russian-language version was launched Monday.

<TEXT>
   Safinaz Zulficar, who reigned as Queen
Farida of Egypt for 11 years before being divorced by her husband
King Farouk, was buried today after a simple funeral.
   Farida, 67, died on Sunday, almost two weeks after being
admitted to a hospital for pneumonia. She spent four days in a coma
before her death.
   President Hosni Mubarak assigned his first chamberlain to join
about 700 mourners at the funeral. Although it was not a state
affair, several senior government officials walked at the head of
the procession.
   The funeral was a far cry from Farouk's nighttime burial in
Cairo, without a procession and with only a few of his closest
family members allowed to attend.
   Farouk, overthrown by the army in 1952 and sent into exile in
Italy, died in Rome on March 18, 1965. At the family's request, his
body was brought to Egypt 12 days later and was buried at Cairo's
Al-Rifai Mosque next to his father, King Fuad I.
   Farida, Arabic for unique, was the name Farouk decided to give
his bride after their marriage in 1938, two years after he became
king. He was 18 then, she 17. They had three daughters, Feria,
Fawzia and Fadia.
   What seemingly began as a happy marriage began to crack up after
Farouk started public affairs with other women and frequented night
clubs and gambling casinos in the mid-1940s. His popularity dropped
as scandal involving him became common knowledge.
   At the same time, Farida, widely regarded as the wronged
partner, gained in public stature.
   Women in Egypt could not sue for divorce at the time, but Farida
demanded a divorce, and continued in her efforts despite pressure
from government officials to dissuade her, said Al-Akhbar newspaper
columnist Mustafa Amin, who was close to the royal family.
   In 1948, Farouk granted the divorce. No reason was given, and
other reports said the divorce was caused because Farida did not
bear him a son.
   The ex-queen moved with the daughters to Switzerland and later
moved to Paris, where she took up painting.
   Farida returned home in 1982 and settled in a small apartment in
Cairo. She held several exhibitions of her paintings, which were
mainly depictions of life in Egypt.
   Al-Ahram reported today that Farida's last wish was to see her
daughters. All three were summoned from Switzerland, where they
live, and were at their mother's bedside when she died.
   Farida never spoke ill of Farouk in public, despite the anguish
she reportedly endured.
   In a eulogy published today, Amin wrote that she once told him:
   ``Remember, he was the father of my daughters. Any bad word I
utter about him would hurt them.''

   Scholars say few people would have been more
surprised by the Pledge of Allegiance's prominence in the 1988
presidential campaign than the man who wrote it. He was a socialist.
   The pledge first appeared in a Boston magazine, The Youth's
Companion, 96 years ago, on Sept. 8, 1892.
   Although there are competing claims to authorship, most
authorities credit the Rev. Francis Bellamy, a Baptist minister who
preached against big business and served as vice president of the
Society of Christian Socialists.
   His daughter-in-law, Rachel Bellamy, 92, of Rochester, N.Y.,
recalls him as tall, proud and ``kind of stuffy.'' She said he
eventually left the ministry because he felt the church ``was not
doing enough to help the working man.''
   Louise Harris of Providence, R.I., who has written two books on
the history of the pledge, believes Bellamy's congregation grew
tired of his political homilies _ one was entitled ``Jesus the
Socialist'' _ and forced him out of the pulpit.
   In any event, Bellamy joined the staff of The Youth's Companion
in 1891 and apparently composed the pledge a few months later,
while the magazine was in the midst of a campaign to sell American
flags.
   The Youth's Companion had pioneered the sale of subscription
``premiums'' ranging from school uniforms to silver tea services.
But it achieved its greatest commercial success, and its enduring
legacy, with its drive to put a flag in every school in the land.
   The flags were priced at $3.30 to $13, depending on size. To
help schools raise the money, the magazine provided ``flag
certificates'' that pupils could sell for 10 cents apiece.
   Starting a year early, The Youth's Companion urged school
children to prepare to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Columbus'
voyage to America, which was coming up in October 1892.
   To show it was truly companionable, the magazine even published
a suggested ``Columbian Celebration'' ceremony. Most of it just
happened to require a flag.
   Sandwiched between a presidential proclamation and an ode to
Columbus, both long forgotten, was the original 23-word pledge,
memorable both for its sentiment and its economy of phrasing: ``I
pledge allegiance to my flag and to the republic for which it
stands: one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.''
   It was not until 1923 that the words ``my flag'' were replaced
by ``the flag of the United States of America'' out of concern that
immigrant children might otherwise think they were pledging
allegiance to some other flag.
   The phrase ``under God'' was inserted in 1954 at the behest of
President Eisenhower, who said that ``in this way we shall
constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be
our country's most powerful resource in peace and war.''
   The original version of the pledge was not signed, but once it
had caught on in the schools, rival claims to authorship quickly
emerged. One group pushed for James B. Upham, an editor of The
Youth's Companion. The other favored Bellamy.
   Harris and a few other scholars argue that Upham was the author.
But two formal investigations, one conducted by the U.S. Flag
Association in 1939 and the other by the Library of Congress in
1957, concluded that Bellamy was responsible.
   David Whitman, a researcher in Washington, D.C., says Bellamy
espoused ``a relatively benign form'' of socialism.
   ``The Nationalist Movement, which he belonged to, wanted to
nationalize chunks of the American economy but have them controlled
at the municipal level. ... He did not practice or preach violent
overthrow of the government by any means,'' Whitman said.
   Controversy over the pledge erupted in the 1940s, when Jehovah's
Witnesses refused to recite it in the public schools. Members of
the sect said swearing allegiance to a material object violated
their religious principles, which dictated allegiance only to God.
   The Supreme Court initially rejected such arguments, ruling in a
1940 case that public schools could expel children who did not
recite the pledge. The court reversed itself in 1943 and said
children could not be compelled to recite the pledge.
   Meantime, Jehovah's Witnesses had been subjected to vicious
attacks in dozens of communities. In Richwood, Va., for example,
members of the sheriff's department and American Legion forced
seven members of the sect to drink large quantities of castor oil,
then tied them together and paraded them through the town.
   ``Bellamy was an avid fan of saying the pledge,'' said Whitman,
``but I can't imagine how he would have felt about it if he had
lived to see the mob violence of the 40s.''

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the World Jewish Congress and
East German leader Erich Honecker on Monday discussed efforts to
fight anti-Semitism.
   Neither side would comment publicly on a plan for East Germany
to aid Holocaust victims.
   Before the meeting, Edgar M. Bronfman said he hoped a final
decision could be reached during his visit on reparations to Jewish
victims of Nazi persecution.
   But the state-run news agency ADN, in several extensive
dispatches, made no mention of discussions about compensation.
   Bronfman also refused specific comment on the issue, saying only
that the talk was ``pleasant, very warm and very cordial.''
   ``We agreed on all the fundamentals,'' he said, adding that
details of the discussions would be announced Tuesday.
   Bronfman has said that an admission of shared responsibility for
the Holocaust was as important as financial contributions to
victims.
   ADN said Honecker told Bronfman of East Germany's efforts to
educate its young people about the horrors of Nazi Germany.
   ``The struggle against racism and anti-Semitism belongs to the
anti-fascist tradition of East Germany,'' Honecker was quoted as
saying. ``We will never forget that many Jews, together with
communists and Social Democrats ... were active in the struggle
against the Nazi dictatorship.''
   ADN quoted Bronfman as telling Honecker that ``I believe that
today we have built a bridge.''
   The news agency said Bronfman thanked Honecker for recent
government efforts on the part of Jews, including funding for the
reconstruction of an East Berlin synagogue.
   After Bronfman arrived Sunday, he told The Associated Press he
believed the East German leadership was sincere in offering
reparations.
   Such an agreement would mark a major change in the communist
nation's previous policies.
   ``I'm optimistic,'' he said. ``What is at stake here is moral
culpability.''
   More than 6 million Jews were killed during Adolf Hitler's Third
Reich, a fact that East Germany does not dispute. Since its
founding in 1949, however, East Germany has argued that it bears no
reponsibility for Nazi atrocities because the nation was born after
World War II ended.
   In past months, East German media have reported on government
efforts to improve relations with East Berlin's Jewish community.
   In June, East Germany said it was willing to provide
``humanitarian aid'' to Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, but
negotiations have continued on the reparations themselves.
   West Berlin Jewish leaders have said that East Germany has been
considering paying up to $100 million.
   In 1952, West Germany signed an agreement with the World Jewish
Congress to compensate Holocaust victims and families. Since then,
West Germany has paid more than $48 billion to Holocaust survivors
worldwide.
   West Germany also was founded in 1949.
   Bronfman also planned to meet with leaders of East Berlin's tiny
Jewish community before departing Tuesday. There are an estimated
450-600 practicing Jews in East Germany.

   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
has returned from Washington, where he received his fourth
chemotherapy treatment for liver cancer.
   Duarte, 62, planned to work in his office Monday but no public
appearances were scheduled, government sources said. He returned
Sunday on a commercial flight.
   During the seven-day stay at Walter Reed Army Medical Center,
Duarte also underwent examinations to determine the results of the
previous treatment.
   Part of his stomach was removed at Walter Reed in June and
doctors said the cancer had spread to his liver. He was given six
to 18 months to live.
   His Salvadoran doctor, Jose Luis Saca, said recently that
Duarte's health has improved.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo's son Andrew said
Monday he has quit his partnership in a law firm to work full time
on building housing for the homeless.
   ``I believe in my heart and soul this is the right thing to
do,'' Cuomo, 30, said. ``I don't want to do this forever, but for
now, there's nothing I'd rather do.''
   Cuomo reportedly earned more than $225,000 annually at the firm
of Blutrich, Falcone and Miller, which he joined three years ago as
a partner.
   His salary as head of HELP, a not-for-profit organization, will
be between $50,000 and $60,000 annually, said Jeffrey Sachs,
director of operations for the group.
   Cuomo founded HELP three years ago to provide transitional
housing for women with children as an alternative to welfare
hotels, and worked out of the law firm's offices as its head.
   His resignation was effective immediately, he said.
   During his father's 1986 re-election campaign, questions were
raised about whether the law firm might be benefiting from having
the governor's son as a partner. The firm did not represent clients
before state agencies that were under the governor's control while
Cuomo was a partner.

<HEAD>Joint Naval Exercises Resume After 7 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Argentine warships began
joint maneuvers Monday for the first time in seven years.
   The former military junta withdrew from the annual ``Unitas''
maneuvers in 1982, following U.S. support for Britain in the war
over the Falkland Islands.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Horacio Altamirano said the exercises
in the South Atlantic are being held to ``increase the preparedness
and professionalism'' of Argentine sailors, and coordinate
procedures for aiding ships in distress.
   The daily newspaper La Nacion reported the U.S. flotilla
includes the missile-carrying destroyers Sampson and Nicholson, the
nuclear-powered attack submarine Shark, and the frigate W.S. Sims.
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy said she could not confirm
the types of U.S. warships. The maneuvers are bilateral, she said,
and not part of ``Unitas.''
   The joint maneuvers, which end Saturday, are a sign that
military relations between the two countries are warming after
years of tensions.
   The military junta that unseated Isabel Peron in a 1976 coup
also pulled out of the 1977 and 1978 ``Unitas'' drills because of
President Jimmy Carter's criticism of the dictatorship's human
rights abuses.
   The attempted reprovisioning of U.S. warships in 1984 at Puerto
Madryn, 960 miles south of Buenos Aires, sparked public protests.
   Last month, Defense Minister Horacio Jaunarena traveled to
Washington at the invitation of Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci,
and Navy chief Adm. Ramon Arosa toured the U.S. aircraft carrier
Independence off Argentina's coast.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gunman who had apparently tried to
steal $1 million in jewels belonging to the late Liberace was shot
and killed by police when he fled the entertainer's museum with a
74-year-old hostage, authorities and witnesses said.
   The dead man was identified as Hugh Perry, 47, of Las Vegas.
Metro Police Lt. Kyle Edwards said Perry had a lengthy arrest
record dating back to the 1960s.
   Hostage Margaret Bloomberg, who had worked at the museum 10
years, was not injured. She was able to give the police the
opportunity to shoot the gunman by sitting on the sidewalk as if
her legs had buckled underneath her.
   The museum is one of the city's top tourist attractions,
featuring memorabilia of the entertainer who gained fame here and
retained a home not far from the Las Vegas Strip.
   Liberace died in February 1987 of complications due to AIDS.
   Mrs. Bloomberg said she was just closing the office Sunday when
the suspect appeared, saying he wanted to deliver a plant. The man
produced a gun, forced his way into the museum, and refused offers
of money, she said. Another worker was able to summon police, she
said.
   Dora Liberace, sister-in-law of the entertainer and
administrator of the museum, said the man carried a bag of tools,
including a crowbar, and obviously intended to break into a case
displaying $1 million in jewelry owned by Liberace. Ms. Liberace
arrived at the museum shortly after the shooting occurred.
   When Perry spotted police, he forced Mrs. Bloomberg out the
front door at gunpoint and made his way toward a car he had driven
to the scene, officials said.
   Mrs. Bloomberg ``just sat down on the sidewalk, pretending her
legs had collapsed under her,'' Mrs. Liberace said. ``He tried to
lift her in the car but couldn't. He leaned back for a minute and
the police shot him.''
   ``When I sat down I figured the police would pick him off,
maybe,'' Mrs. Bloomberg said.
   John Sullivan, deputy chief of detectives, said the man
threatened Mrs. Bloomberg ``and she started to resist while he
tried to force her into a car.''
   She fell to the ground and an officer shot Perry with one
bullet, Sullivan said.

<HEAD>Business Inventories Continue to Rise, But Sales Outstrip Them</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories continued their steady
rise in August, the government said Monday, but economists remain
untroubled because the expansion is not outpacing strong sales.
   The Commerce Department said goods held on shelves and backlots
rose 0.8 percent to $733.7 billion, following a 0.7 percent gain in
July. It was the 20th consecutive monthly increase.
   Rising inventories can be a sign of economic sluggishness as
manufacturers order production cuts and layoffs while goods in
reserve are sold off.
   However, analysts are not particularly troubled by current
inventory levels because sales also have been strong. Compared with
a year ago, inventories are up 8.7 percent while sales are up 8.0
percent.
   The department said August sales totaled $487.7 billion, up a
brisk 1.1 percent from July, when the gain was a slight 0.1
percent. It was the ninth increase in a row.
   ``If we're looking for a reason for a slowdown in 1989, it won't
be excess inventory building. ... Typically recessions develop when
there are excess levels of inventory and we're not looking at those
levels this year,'' said John Hagens, an economist with The Wefa
Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm.
   Inventory accumulation in August was led by a 1.4 percent rise
at retailers, where sales are the slowest. Wholesale inventories
were up 0.6 percent while inventories at factories, where an export
boom has kept sales strongest, increased 0.5 percent.
   However, half of the inventory buildup among retailers is
accounted for by a 2.9 percent rise at auto dealers. Car sales have
been strong this year, so dealers did not offer price cuts or
financing incentives to move cars from the old model year off their
lots.
   ``Inventories are in pretty good shape, with the notable
exception of apparel,'' said Maury N. Harris, an economist with
PaineWebber Inc. ``However, the overall inventory level won't
remain in good shape unless retail sales pick up in October and
November. But I think they will.''
   In sales, a 2.1 percent increase at manufacturing plants more
than offset a 0.1 percent decline at the retail level. Wholesalers
reported a 0.7 percent increase.
   An advance estimate of retail sales for September, released last
week, showed a 0.4 percent decline.
   The combination of moderately strong gain in inventories and an
even more robust sales increase left the inventory-to-sales ratio
at 1.50, unchanged from July and June and up slightly from 1.49 a
year ago. That means it would take 1.5 months to exhaust
inventories at the August sales pace, a ratio not considered
unusually high.

<TEXT>
   Two Sikhs sentenced to death for the
1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi won't be
executed until the president rules on a petition for mercy, news
reports said Monday.
   The executions of Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh were scheduled
for Oct. 19 but will be delayed until President Ramaswamy
Venkataraman rules on the mercy plea, the United News of India
reported.
   The news agency, quoting an unidentified governement spokesman,
said a new date for the executions would be announced if the
petition is rejected.
   The mercy plea was filed by Kehar Singh, 54, but both executions
will be stayed, the agency said. Satwant Singh, 24, has refused to
file a similar plea.
   The announcement of the postponement came hours after two courts
declined to stay the hanging of the two men.
   The Delhi High Court rejected a petition for the stay until
police investigate a complaint filed by Satwant Singh that security
guards shot at him after disarming him following Mrs. Gandhi's
assassination, the Press Trust of India said.
   A magistrate's court in New Delhi, another court where Satwant's
complain was being heard, also rejected a plea to delay the
execution.
   Both courts said they had no jurisdiction to stay the hanging
after it was upheld by the Supreme Court.
   The petition also noted authorities recently arrested a Sikh
terrorist who allegedly helped plan Mrs. Gandhi's murder and an
investigation was pending, the report said.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot and killed in the garden of her New Delhi
home on Oct. 31, 1984, by two of her Sikh bodyguards, Satwant Singh
and Beant Singh.
   The two men are not related. Sikhs by doctrine of their faith
take the name Singh, which means lion.
   Mrs. Gandhi apparently was murdered in revenge for an army raid
she ordered four months earlier on the Golden Temple, the Sikhs'
holiest shrine in the northern city of Amritsar. More than 1,200
people died in the attack, most of them Sikhs.
   Satwant Singh and Beant Singh were shot by other security guards
moments after the assassination, and Beant Singh later died of
bullet wounds.
   Beant Singh's maternal uncle, Kehar Singh, was arrested a month
later and charged with conspiracy in the assassination.
   Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh were convicted and sentenced to
death by hanging in January 1986 after an eight-month trial in New
Delhi.
   The Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court upheld the
convictions and death sentences.
   The Supreme Court on Aug. 3 overturned the death sentence of a
third man, Balbir Singh, ruling there was insufficient evidence to
prove he participated in the conspiracy.
   A district judge Wednesday authorized the execution of Satwant
Singh and Kehar Singh, who are being held at New Delhi's
maximum-security Tihar Central Jail.

   The retiring commander of U.S. forces in the
Persian Gulf met with Kuwaiti leaders Monday as part of a farewell
visit, officials said.
   Gen. George B. Crist, who steps down next month as head of the
U.S. Central Command, called on Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime
Minister, Sheik Saad Abdullah al-Sabah.
   He also visited Defense Minister Sheik Nawaf al-Ahmed al-Sabah,
and was a luncheon guest of Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, Kuwait's
petroleum minister and director of its state-owned oil company.
   Kuwait-based sources, asking not to be identified, said the U.S.
flagging of Kuwaiti oil tankers was discussed. But they said no
decision was expected on how long the American commitment might
last in the aftermath of the Iran-Iraq cease-fire that went into
effect Aug. 20.
   Kuwait is not likely to remove the U.S. flags from 11
state-owned tankers re-registered by the United States last year
until a ``substantive peace agreement'' between Iran and Iraq is
reached, the sources said.
   Crist had said during a visit to Bahrain that any decision on
ending the reflagging would be made by Kuwaiti officials, and until
then the ships would continue to have the ``traditional
protection'' of the U.S. Navy.
   The four-star Marine Corps officer, whose headquarters in Tampa,
Fla., controls the U.S. military operations in the gulf, came to
Kuwait from Bahrain, where he called on top officials including the
Emir, Sheik Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa.
   The Kuwaiti tankers were reflagged to qualify for U.S. naval
protection from Iranian attack. The United States recently ended
full-time convoys of the tankers, but U.S. warships in the gulf
continue to monitor their movements, U.S. officers say.

   A power outage darkened buildings in
scattered pockets of downtown when a high-voltage transformer
failed Monday, but all electricity was restored within an hour,
officials said.
   Lights flickered across the Salt Lake Valley when the
transformer failed at 10:23 a.m. MDT, but only the downtown area
lost power, said Utah Power & Light Co. spokesman Dave Mead.
   The failure of the transformer in a substation blew fuses there,
knocking out power to a second substation and triggering a
``cascade effect'' in the area, he said.
   It was not known what caused the failure of the transformer,
which reduces a 12,000-volt feed to 4,000 volts, Mead said.
   Power to 90 percent of the area was restored by 10:45, with the
remainder by 11:20 a.m., he said.
   The transformer remained out of order Monday afternoon, but Utah
Power transferred power feeds to alternate circuits, Mead said.

<HEAD>Rocket Test Firing Scheduled Wednesday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A space shuttle main rocket engine will
be test-fired Wednesday at the Marshall Space Flight Center, the
first extended firing since the roar of Saturn rockets echoed
across Huntsville in the 1960s.
   ``It's going to be something Huntsville hasn't heard for quite
awhile,'' Marshall spokesman Dom Amatore said.
   The 15-second firing is part of a series of tests on the shuttle
main engines and coincides with the city's ``Space Awareness Week.''
   NASA engineers want to determine how long the rocket motors,
fueled by hydrogen and oxygen from the shuttle's huge external
tank, can run if needed. The engines now operate for about eight
minutes during a shuttle launch.
   Shuttle engine No. 0208, installed in the test stand in August,
was ``warmed up'' in a 1.5-second start test last month.
   After this week's test, a third test firing of 45 seconds will
be scheduled in November. Amatore said the primary goal of the
first brief tests is to verify that Marshall can handle the firings
and whether a metal ``flame bucket'' on the test stand can handle
the rocket exhaust.
   The last test firing of a big rocket motor at Marshall was a
Saturn test on Sept. 11, 1969, about two months after men first set
foot on the moon.
   Marshall is NASA's main propulsion center. In addition to
developing the Saturn rockets, it manages space shuttle propulsion
systems, including the main engines and solid fuel booster rockets,
which are test-fired in Utah.
   ``Space Awareness Week'' includes a visit by the crew of the
shuttle Discovery.
   The five astronaunts who flew last month in the first
post-Challenger shuttle mission are to be in Huntsville on Thursday
and Friday to thank Marshall engineers.
   They also will lead a parade and appear at a public reception
Thursday.
   On Wednesday, singer John Denver and former New Mexico senator
and Apollo astronaut Harrison Schmitt will be in town to discuss
proposed new space missions.
   Denver, who hopes to ride into orbit with a Soviet crew in 1990,
will talk about Earth observation missions while Schmitt will
discuss proposals for manned missions to the moon and Mars.

   The strain on U.S. industrial capacity eased
in September for the first time in seven months as utilities scaled
back after the summer heat wave, the government said Monday.
   The Federal Reserve Board said the overall operating rate last
month at U.S. factories, mines and utilities fell to 83.6 percent
of capacity, down 0.2 percentage points from August.
   In July, the rate also was 83.8 percent, soaring to an
eight-year high from 83.0 percent in June as utilities produced
more electricity to run air conditioners.
   Utility operating rates fell from 83.6 percent in August to 79.9
percent last month, while electric utilities fell from 88.1 percent
to 83.5 percent.
   ``Utilities had their big surge in July and August and then they
came back to normal,'' said Robert G. Dederick, an economist with
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
   ``The relevant thing is what went on in the manufacturing
sector. ... There, I think we can say the pressure on resources
hasn't worsened, but it still remains relatively high and therefore
any easing of inflation pressures is unlikely,'' he said.
   The operating rate at manufacturing plants held steady at 83.8
percent, the same as August and down slightly from 83.9 percent in
July, the most recent peak.
   Economists have expressed concern that high factory operating
rates and a tight labor market are exerting inflationary pressure
on the economy. If overall operating rates get too high, overworked
factories can have trouble meeting demand, leading to higher prices.
   Capacity use at manufacturers of durable goods, ``big ticket''
items expected to last three or more years, edged up 0.1 percentage
points to 82.4 percent while the rate for non-durable goods edged
down by the same amount to 85.8 percent.
   The largest increase came at auto assembly plants, where the
operating rate rose 3.6 percentage points to 74.0 percent.
   ``The overall level of capacity utilization doesn't signal as
much price pressure as it might because the hot industries are
cooling and the cool industries are speeding up,'' said John
Hagens, an economist for The Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa.,
forecasting firm.
   Two areas of particular tightness _ paper and textiles _ have
cooled from levels a year ago. Capacity use among paper
manufacturers was 93.8 percent in August, the latest month
available, down from 95.7 percent in September 1987. The rate for
textiles has eased from 93.6 percent to 89.1 percent in August.
   The rate for the mining sector, which includes oil and gas
drilling, rebounded to 83.1 percent last month, up from 82.8
percent in August but still below the 83.2 percent July rate.

<HEAD>5th Circuit: U.S. Companies Overseas Don't Have To Meet Civil
Rights Laws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. companies operating abroad do not have
to comply with the civil rights law forbidding discrimination on
the job, a federal appeals court ruled Monday.
   The 2-1 ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a
lower court ruling against Ali Boureslan, a naturalized U.S.
citizen who was born in Lebanon and employed by Aramco in Dhahran,
Saudi Arabia.
   He filed suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
contending that he was fired in June 1984 after a harassment
campaign by his supervisor _ ``a campaign which took the form of
racial, religious and ethnic slurs,'' the 5th Circuit said.
   The seven-page majority ruling by Judge Eugene Davis said the
court could not find any indication in the law or in its
legislative history that Congress had meant to extend civil rights
protection to U.S. citizens employed abroad.
   Arguments that it is unfair to deny Americans employed abroad
protections to which they are entitled in this country are
appealing, but do not overcome other strong policy arguments, Davis
wrote.
   ``The religious and social customs practiced in many countries
are wholly at odds with those of this country,'' the ruling said.
``Requiring American employers to comply with Title VII in such a
country could well leave American corporations the difficult choice
of either refusing to employ United States in the country or
discontinuing business.''
   In a strong 17-page dissent, Judge Carolyn Dineen King said it
may be necessary to enforce the law abroad to be sure that
minorities and women have an equal chance at home.
   ``Today's decision means that one U.S. citizen assigned to the
Saudi office of a U.S. corporation, and another U.S. citizen
working for the same company in Texas could experience identical
acts of discrimination, but only the latter will have a remedy.
This situation creates a dilemma for minorities and women: foreign
assignments will be less attractive, while refusal of such an
assignment could limit an individual's opportunity for
advancement,'' she wrote.
   She noted that assignement to a foreign office is frequently a
required step for promotion within a multinational corporation.
This means, she said, that this country may have to enforce its
civil rights laws abroad to ensure equal chances at foreign
assignments that would affect employment opportunities in the
United States.
   Her dissent agreed with other arguments brought up by Boureslan
and the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, which entered a
friend-of-the-court brief.
   They argued that a section exempting aliens working for U.S.
corporations in other countries showed that Congress did intend it
to apply to U.S. citizens under such circumstances.

   The Soviet Union has built a quieter, more
economical passenger jet, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda
reported Monday.
   The Tupolev-204, which can carry 214 passengers and has a range
of 2,480 miles, will undergo flight trials this year and be
introduced into service by the state-run carrier Aeroflot in 1990,
Pravda said.
   Alexei Tupolev, head of the Tupolev design bureau, said the goal
was to create a plane that would consume less fuel and be cheaper
to operate. Pravda said aircraft builders believe the Tu-204 will
be the most economical Soviet plane in its class.
   Pravda also published a photograph of the airliner, showing its
two wing-mounted jet engines and a fuselage that resembles other
aircraft of the Tupolev bureau, including the Tu-154 passenger jet
that is one of the workhorses in the Aeroflot fleet.
   Tupolev said innovative production processes had ensured a
reduction in the new plane's weight and improved the performance of
its exterior.
   The Tu-204 will also be more comfortable for passengers and will
be quieter, Pravda said.

   Republican Dan Quayle grabbed a
Democratic line Monday as he campaigned in the industrial Midwest
pledging ``good jobs at good wages.''
   In a series of stops across Michigan, where the presidential
race is considered close, Quayle stressed economic themes, even
using some phrases that sounded more like Democrat Michael Dukakis
than the leader of Quayle's own ticket, George Bush.
   ``When we talk about the future. we're talking about jobs and
opportunity,'' Quayle told thousands of cheering high school
students in Flint. ``I'm talking about good jobs and I'm talking
about good jobs at good wages.''
   The good jobs-good wages line has been a staple in Dukakis
campaign speeches for months.
   As for the election, Quayle said the Republicans would ignore
polls showing them ahead with three weeks to go.
   ``It is down to the wire time,'' he said. ``We all think it's
going to be very competitive. We're going to run like we're 10
points behind.''
   In a state where the auto industry has been hard-hit by foreign
competition, Quayle said, ``We are talking about fair, free trade''
without resorting to ``protectionist barriers.''
   Later in the day, Quayle was traveling to Mount Pleasant,
Traverse City and Gaylord elsewhere in Michigan.
   Quayle, an Indiana Senator, appealed to regional pride at
various stops, where he was greeted by enthusiastic crowds inside
and knots of protesters outside.
   ``That man from Massachusetts may look down on us in middle
America, but come Election Day they'll be looking up to George
Bush,'' he said. ``Us Midwesterners have to stick together.''
   Quayle appreared relaxed and upbeat as he swung across the
state, surprising customers with an appearance at a fast-food
restaurant and occasionally joking with reporters on his campaign
plane.
   Questioned outside one stop, Quayle said that he was ``very
close personally'' with presidential standardbearer George Bush but
that joint appearances by the two would be ``a little bit
counterproductive.''
   ``I wouldn't ask for it,'' Quayle said. ``I want him to cover
his part of the country and I want to cover my part of the
country.''
   In his remarks to the students, Quayle said, ``My goal is the
same goal you have and that is a drug-free America.''
   ``When you have a drug kingpin involved in murder, that person
is going to get the death penalty,'' he said. ``It may sound harsh,
but those people are peddling and are merchants of death. When
they're going to murder our children and put poison in their veins,
yes, capital punishment is an appropriate response.''
   Quayle, who said last week that he had complained to Bush
campaign chairman James Baker III about anonymous criticism of him
from campaign officials, said they had had a ``very upbeat'' talk.
   Asked if Baker had offered him any advice for the final three
weeks of the campaign, Quayle said, ``No, I gave him my advice.''
   As he started his campaign day, Quayle dropped in at a Burger
King, surprising a handful of customers.
   He apologized for disturbing the relative tranquility of the
place as a crowd of reporters and photographers climbed over booths.
   ``You were sitting here nice and quiet and we ruined it,'' he
said.
   But he left with an exhortation: ``Tell them George Bush and I
will work hard for you.''

<HEAD>Rare Giant Fern Could Be Endangered By Development</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OVIEDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A giant fern so rare in the United States
that biologists had refused to reveal its whereabouts for fear it
would be wiped out now faces extinction anyway because of a
proposed development.
   In the continental United States, the cuplet fern grows only in
two small swampy spots a half-mile apart in the Black Hammock, a
7,680-acre wetlands area about 10 miles northeast of Orlando.
   Identified in 1802, the fern used to grow on the southern edge
of Lake Okeechobee but was plowed under for farmland decades ago.
The fern, Dennstaedtia bipinnata, also is found in the Carribean
and South America,
   ``It's a fern that's over your head. You can stand under it,''
said David Hardin, a research ecologist for the Florida Natural
Areas Inventory. ``When you get out in a clump of these giant ferns
you feel like you're out in the tropics.''
   But a tiny piece of the Black Hammock attracted the interest of
a retired priest, the Rev. John Caulfield of Lakeland, and he and
another priest bought 40 acres and planned to sell it off in
five-acre lots.
   The St. Johns River Water Management District discovered
Caulfield's plans 13 months ago when he had a road cut through the
wetlands south of Lake Jesup without a drainage permit.
   The road and the small development ``would bode most ill for the
fern,'' said Peggy Lantz, who edits publications for the Florida
Native Plant Society and the Florida Audubon Society.
   Hank Whittier, a University of Central Florida biology professor
who takes students on fern tours, says even cutting down trees
nearby could let in light and cold wind that could change the
fern's special climate.
   Whittier has transplanted a few ferns to the university's
arboretum, but they aren't as robust outside their native habitat.
   The water district regulatory agency planned to fine Caulfield
$1,000 and make him plant trees where the road was cut, but
Caulfield has applied for an after-the-fact permit to build the
quarter-mile road and develop eight lots. He already has sold two.
   The water management district says Caulfield is trying to figure
out a way to develop his property and protect the fern.
   The water district also is considering several ways to protect
the fern, said Pat Frost, the district's field office director in
Orlando.
   It will be difficult for Caulfield to convince the district that
he can develop the property without damaging the wetlands, Frost
said.
   ``We recognize the fern as a valuable resource and we would be
remiss to not even address it,'' Frost said.
   But the long-term outlook is not good. The entire Black Hammock
is slowly being nibbled away by turf farms, vegetable farms, tree
nurseries and rural homes, Whittier said.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Pat Swindall was indicted today on charges
of perjury, accused of lying to a federal grand jury investigating
money laundering.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr said Swindall, a Republican, was
indicted on 10 counts of perjury over his testimony before a grand
jury last February about a sting in which a federal agent posed as
a money launderer.
   Swindall's office said today he had no immediate response to the
announcement. But he had said Sunday, during a television
interview, that he expected to be indicted and was glad because he
hoped it would give him a chance to clear his name before his
re-election bid goes to the voters Nov. 8.
   In an unusually bitter race, Swindall, 47, is seeking a third
term from suburban Atlanta's 4th District against Democratic
opponent Ben Jones, 46, a former actor on television's ``Dukes of
Hazzard'' who lost to Swindall in 1986.
   Jones has criticized Swindall ever since the
money-laundering-related charges were first aired, while Swindall
has assailed Jones' past conviction on a charge of wife-beating, a
conviction Jones says stemmed from alcohol abuse that he has since
overcome.
   In Sunday's interview, Swindall said he expected to be arraigned
this afternoon and planned to waive a number of rights, including
the right to charge the government with misconduct in the case, so
that he can go on trial next Monday. Barr said he did not know
whether such a quick trial would be possible.
   Swindall said he planned to represent himself at the trial.
   ``I am actually excited because it will be the first opportunity
I am going to have to clear the air, clear my name and give the
voters a legitimate race based on the issues,'' Swindall said in
the interview Sunday.
   Angered by continued reports linking his name with the grand
jury investigation, Swindall took the House floor on Oct. 3 to
demand an immediate indictment.
   Barr said the timing of the indictment ``has nothing whatsoever
to do with politics'' or Swindall's request to be indicted.
   Swindall was first linked publicly to the money laundering
investigation earlier this year when it was disclosed that his Aug.
28, 1987, meeting with an undercover federal agent posing as a
money launderer for underworld figures had been videotaped.
   ``Money laundering'' is a term for various methods of getting
around federal currency laws by transferring illicitly raised cash
_ drug money, for example _ into bank accounts in such a way that
its origin is hid.
   Swindall was introduced to the undercover agent by Charles
LeChasney, a former Atlanta businessman who was active in
Republican circles. LeChasney is one of the two men scheduled to go
on trial next week on money-laundering charges.
   LeChasney and several Swindall aides testified before the grand
jury last month. Swindall testified before the grand jury in
February.
   In June, Atlanta newspapers obtained several tape recordings
from the investigation and published excerpts from a series of
conversations between Swindall, LeChasney and the undercover agent.
   The tapes showed that Swindall continued to pursue negotiations
for an $850,000 home construction loan after being told it might be
financed with drug money he would be helping to launder.
   Swindall was quoted on the tapes as saying that the source of
the money was ``Charles' problem,'' since LeChasney would be
obtaining the money to lend to Swindall. He added, ``I frankly
don't think it's incumbent upon me to go out and find out where XYZ
Corp. gets their money, or, for that matter, where Chrysler Corp.
gets their money. If they set back the odometer, that's their
problem.''
   He ended the negotiations after being told he would have to
accept the money in person in cash and sign a receipt.
   Swindall later apologized for his role in the negotiations,
calling it a mistake in judgment, but he denied any wrongdoing.
   He also asked the House ethics committee to determine if he had
violated any law or House rule. The panel agreed to investigate,
but has not issued a ruling.
   The indictment said Swindall lied when he told the grand jury
last February that he did not have any concrete indication that
LeChasney and the undercover agent were discussing illegal
activities.
   Swindall testified that he was suspicious of the agent, but did
not have enough information to report the matter to authorities,
the indictment said.
   Another count of the indictment accuses Swindall of lying when
he denied the agent discussed keeping the large cash loan from
being reported to federal regulators.

   More than 200 miners staged a protest
rally outside Gov. Arch Moore's office Monday, complaining about
the state's black lung fund and urging that he fire his energy
commissioner.
   Moore finally appeared with a state police escort and walked
through the demonstrators, greeting some and shaking hands.
   None in the crowd tried to confront Moore with the demands,
which were a mixed bag of complaints about commissioner Ken
Faerber, a $30 million loan from the black lung fund made last
fiscal year, and Workers' Compensation Commissioner Nelson
Robinson, who oversees the black lung fund.
   The rally was called by the Coal Miners Political Action
Committee, the political arm of the UMW. The committee has endorsed
Moore's opponent in the governor's race, Democrat Gaston Caperton.
   ``I think it's nice they express themselves,'' Moore said when
asked about the protest. ``And I would hope it's sincere.''
   Just after the rally and in the opposite wing of the Capitol,
the state Supreme Court agreed to consider a petition filed last
week by UMW President Richard Trumka against Faerber and Moore. The
petition said Faerber and Moore have interfered with the operations
of the Board of Coal Mine Health and Safety, which is supposed to
review each mine fatality and issue regulations if needed to
prevent a recurrence.
   The court unanimously set arguments for Nov. 2, six days before
the election.
   Faerber denied interfering with the board and said the suit was
politically inspired.
   ``Where's Arch?'' the crowd chanted during the protest outside
the governor's office. ``Where is Moore? ... We will not be moved.''
   Charles Whited of Chesapeake, who said he was part of the Black
Lung Disabled Workers Organization, said the miners were angry
because of a high death rate in the state's mines and because $30
million was borrowed from the miners' black lung fund to help keep
state government afloat last fiscal year.
   But Faerber said last year's mine death rate of nine was the
lowest in state history. He said 10 miners have died this year.
   In addition, the black lung loan was made by the Legislature,
not the governor's office, although Moore supported it, with the
concurrence of the UMW leadership.

   Political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche
Jr. and six co-defendants pleaded innocent Monday to federal fraud
and conspiracy charges in connection with alleged loans to his
enterprises.
   In an arraignment lasting less than 10 minutes, LaRouche and his
associates spoke only once: to swear, ``I do'' to a promise to
return to court for trial Nov. 21 and for a hearing on a motion
Nov. 10.
   U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. speeded the proceeding
by saying that he assumed that all the defendants were pleading
innocent and asking for a jury trial. Their lawyers nodded
agreement.
   LaRouche was more vocal at a news conference in Washington
earlier Monday, calling the indictment ``a heap of garbage'' and
asserting, ``I'm certainly not guilty.''
   ``This is purely a political stunt,'' the 66-year-old
independent candidate for president said. ``Nebulous charges never
occur this close to an election except as a dirty trick.''
   LaRouche was indicted in Alexandria last Friday on 13 counts of
mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to
defraud the Internal Revenue Service. Conviction on all counts
carries a prison term of 65 years and fines of $3.25 million.
   Six of his associates also were charged and face lesser
sentences if convicted. The grand jury said their scheme raised
more than $34 million in loans to LaRouche's political and
commercial groups from individuals nationwide between 1983 and 1987
with no intention of repaying them.
   The indictment said LaRouche conspired to defraud IRS by having
his expenses paid by friends and groups associated with him. It
added that he has not filed a federal income tax return since at
least 1979.
   ``This is a screwball charge,'' LaRouche said. ``The government
does not charge I evaded taxes, because I have made clear I have no
money income.'' He said he relied on the gifts of friends and being
``hosted'' by various organizations and conferences. ``There is no
tax liability.''
   LaRouche added, ``I had nothing to do with raising $34
million.'' He said he had counseled some groups but never had
authority over them and that the central organization described in
the indictment does not exist.
   ``This is a malicious, vindictive prosecution,'' he said.
   LaRouche, who is campaigning in 12 states and the District of
Columbia, said he believed that Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis prevailed on like-minded federal prosecutors in the
Reagan administration to seek the indictment, because LaRouche has
predicted dire consequences if Dukakis is elected.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said last Friday that LaRouche was
being treated like any other citizen accused of a crime.
   The seven defendants were all released on their own personal
recognizance but pledged to pay $5,000 if they fail to appear for
court dates.
   Judge Bryan allowed them unlimited travel in the United States
and abroad so long as they informed the court clerk in advance.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson had objected to international
travel but was overruled.
   Bryan made clear he plans to move the case quickly, saying ``90
percent of the (defense) motions in this case are going to come
straight out of the word processor and only two or three or four
will require serious thought. The rest I can recite by heart.''
   An earlier federal trial of LaRouche and other associates in
Boston ended in a mistrial because jurors objected to the length of
the case. The Boston case is scheduled for retrial in January.
   LaRouche's codefendants in Virginia are his fund-raising chief,
William Wertz; his chief legal adviser, Edward Spannaus; and four
fund-raisers, Michael Billington, Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg and
Joyce Rubinstein.

   A homegrown ballet company is hopping
mad over the city's invitation to the Cincinnati Ballet,
particularly since the larger company will perform the
``Nutcracker'' a week before its own version.
   ``We feel terrified,'' Cheryl Van Metre, artistic director of
the local Appalachian Ballet Company, said Monday. ``I hate to be
in competition with them. It boils down to having money.''
   The Knoxville Arts Council has welcomed a plan to have the
Cincinnati Ballet come south for the fall-winter season each year
as City Ballet. The council says it's a great way to bring
professional, big-city ballet to this east Tennessee city of
180,000.
   The smaller company, though, fears losing the audience for its
bread-and-butter production _ the popular Christmas classic
choreographed to Tchaikovsky's ``Nutcracker Suite.'' Its Nutcracker
is scheduled Dec. 4, a week after the Cincinnati Ballet's.
   ``We are a semiprofessional group of local dancers and we've
performed in Knoxville and all the surrounding areas for 11
years,'' said Ms. Van Metre, who studied at London's Royal Ballet
before returning home to Knoxville. ``(Nutcracker) makes the most
amount of profit for us. This is how we make our money to exist''
in addition to receiving grant money, she said.
   Her company, she adds, contributes to the community by bringing
ballet to public schools across an area often associated with buck
dancing and bluegrass music.
   Carol Hicks, project director for City Ballet, acknowledged the
struggle that the Appalachian Ballet has on its hands but said
there was little anyone could do.
   ``Our feeling is that we're bringing in a different caliber of
dance,'' she said. ``This is an opportunity for Knoxville to have a
world-renown dance troupe.
   ``It's regrettable. I know it's going to be a thorn in their
side. We've asked them to come to our meetings to talk about
things,'' she said.

<HEAD>House Report Says IRS Failing To Collect Billions in Business
Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is losing billions of dollars
in tax revenues each year because the Internal Revenue Service does
not use an enforcement program on business taxpayers that it has
been using effectively on individuals, a House panel said Monday.
   A report from the House Government Operations subcommittee on
commerce, consumer and monetary affairs estimated that between $3.2
billion and $8 billion a year in taxes on interest and dividends
earned by businesses is never collected because the income is not
reported to the IRS.
   While the revenue loss estimates ``are not statistically
precise,'' the report said they provide ample justification for the
IRS to include businesses in the document-matching program it now
uses to verify interest and dividend earnings on individual tax
returns.
   Under the existing document-matching program, the IRS compares
``information returns'' detailing interest and dividend payments to
individuals with the individuals' actual income tax returns. The
program in fiscal 1985 produced $2.35 billion in additional tax
revenue from individuals.
   Although banks and corporations are not required to file such
information returns on income payments to corporations, the House
report said the IRS received _ but never used _ 26 million such
returns in 1985, showing income payments to 5 million businesses
totaling $987 billion.
   ``By casting these information returns aside, IRS is not only
missing the chance to assess many billions of dollars of unreported
business tax liabilities but has created a double standard of
enforcement that is more lenient by far toward businesses than
individuals,'' said Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., chairman of the
subcommittee.
   IRS spokesman Frank Keith said Monday the agency has not seen
the House report and will have no comment until agecny officials
can review it.
   But at a hearing before Barnard's subcommittee last year, IRS
Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs said the costs of implementing a
document-matching program for corporations would not be justified
by the additional revenue that would be generated.
   Gibbs said the administrative costs of a document-matching
program for corporations would be much higher than for individuals
because corporations use different fiscal years, varying accounting
methods and different names.
   Although the problems cited by Gibbs all ``pertain to the way
income is reported'' to the IRS, the House report said the IRS
``never considered the desirably of modifying the reporting
requirements, nor assessed the feasibility of a partial
document-matching program encompassing those corporations to which
the difficulties do not pertain.''
   Gibbs told the subcommittee last year the IRS would begin using
document-matching to verify income reported on tax returns from
single-owner businesses and would initiate a multi-year study to
determine the extent of business underreporting of interest and
dividend income.
   He also promised to begin a test program using information
returns to detect corporations and partnerships that do not file
any income tax return.
   The House report said the test program in one district office
was so effective the IRS now has expanded it to nine more districts
and could have a document-matching program ready by next spring to
identify non-filers among corporations and partnerships nationwide.
   But despite such efforts, Barnard said the IRS ``has not been
sufficiently diligent in attempting to extend its sophisticated
computer matching capabilities to businesses.''
   ``Individuals, and now sole proprietors, who know that each and
every one of their returns will be scrutinized by IRS' computers
for unreported income deserve to know why corporate and partnership
returns are being excused from this automatic examination
process,'' Barnard said.
   The report said Congress should help the IRS set up a
document-matching program for corporate returns by enacting
legislation to require that businesses and financial institutions
report to the IRS all dividend and interest payments to
corporations.
   Barnard introduced such legislation earlier this year, but it
was never reported out of the House Ways and Means Committee.

<HEAD>Antarctic Ozone Hole Moderates This Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Antarctic ``ozone hole,'' which has raised
scientific concern in recent years, seems to have moderated
slightly, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
reported Monday.
   The so-called hole is a depletion in the amount of ozone high in
the atmosphere over the South Pole region. Some scientists also
have found indications of a similar North Pole depletion.
   This phenomenon was detected in the early 1980s and raised
concern because ozone _ a form of oxygen _ helps block harmful
ultraviolet radiation from the sun. That radiation has been
associated with skin cancer.
   Instruments sent up in balloons have found that the amount of
ozone in the air above Antarctica this month averaged 200 Dobson
units.
   By comparison, measurements averaged 135 Dobson units last
October and 165 the October before. They were as high as 250 units
in 1980.
   The Dobson unit is a measurement of ozone made by comparing how
much of each of two wavelengths of sunlight is absorbed in the air.
That ratio changes depending on the concentration of ozone.
   October, which marks springtime in the Antarctic, is the time of
year when ozone is most depleted over the area, according to Walter
Komhyr of NOAA's Environmental Research Laboratories in Boulder,
Colo.
   However, the apparent improvement does not mean the threat of
ozone depletion is reduced, Komhyr said.
   Rather, it seems to indicate that natural variations in the
atmosphere can lead to large year-to-year changes in ozone, he said.
   The ozone hole occurs within a vortex of west-to-east winds
which tend to circle the Antarctic during the winter and spring
months.
   This year, Komhyr noted, the temperatures high in the atmosphere
have been a few degrees warmer than during the last two years.
   The warmer temperatures reduce the formation of clouds in the
stratosphere and that may be helping protect the ozone. It is
within those clouds that chlorine compounds tend to do the most
damage to ozone, Komhyr explained.
   Reducing the release of chlorine compounds has become a major
focus in recent years. They are largely derived from
chlorofluorocarbons, man-made gases used in refrigeration,
industrial processes and as aerosol propellants in some countries.

<HEAD>Only One US College in Six Requires Language Study</HEAD>
<HEAD>By CARL HARTMAN</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only one of six four-year colleges in the
United States requires that all students getting degrees study a
foreign language, the American Council on Education reported Monday.
   The same proportion has raised its foreign language requirement
over the past five years.
   Foreign language requirements in other countries are
considerably heavier. It takes seven years of English to graduate
from an Israeli high school, for example.
   A study by Charles J. Andersen Jr., senior research associate
for the council, found that about one in eight of the colleges, 13
percent, requires some foreign language study of all applicants.
One in 12 increased its requirement between 1982 and 1987.
   There was much less interest in languages among two-year
community colleges, which are more oriented toward getting jobs for
their graduates. Only 1 percent required any foreign language study
as a condition of entrance and only about 13 percent required any
further instruction for the associate degrees they usually grant.
   The survey was based on replies from nearly 400 of more than
3,200 institutions listed by the U.S. Department of Education.
   Richard Brod, who does similar studies for the Modern Language
Association, said in a telephone interview that requirements have
been increasing since the late 1970s or early 1980s. He said the
trend is based on a recognition of a need for competitiveness
against rivalry from other countries.
   Language requirements here were much heavier before World War
II, when a smaller proportion of high school graduates went on to
college.
   ``There was a loosening in the 1950s and 1960s,'' Brod said.
``Then there was a revival _ based partly on the Soviets sending up
the first Sputnik (space satellite).''
   Brod found language study reaching a peak in 1965-66, and then
declining again. ``Now enrollments in foreign language classes are
increasing, at a time when enrollments in general are only holding
steady,'' he said.
   The council study also found:
   _77 percent of all four-year colleges require students to take
at least one internationally-oriented course, such as Western
history or world civilization.
   _63 percent of the colleges had programs permitting study in
other countries.
   _85 percent reported at least some foreign publications in their
libraries; among two-year colleges, 32 percent said they had none
at all.
   _Nearly half the four-year colleges increased the number of
foreign students in the past five years. More than half increased
the number of international courses, hired new faculty with
knowledge of international affairs and increased the size of the
international collections in their libraries.

<HEAD>Sudan Needs Half-Billion Dollars to Ease Starvation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudan is working with the United Nations
and the World Bank to raise nearly half a billion dollars urgently
needed to save millions of hungry people displaced by floods and
war.
   The United Nations plans a worldwide appeal for immediate
donations totaling $50 million to care for 2 million people
displaced in southern Sudan by a 5-year-old civil war, according to
Bryan Wannop, representative of the U.N. Development Program.
   In addition, experts from the Washington-based World Bank on
Monday proposed a two-year, $407 million reconstruction program
from August and September floods that destroyed $3.1 billion in
property.
   Sudan, Africa's largest country, has a foreign debt of $11
billion.
   In addition, the government is spending about $1 million a day
fighting the war in the south, which the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army seems to be winning. On Monday, a rebel radio
broadcast monitored in Kenya claimed the capture of a sixth
southern town in four weeks.
   The guerrilla war _ fought between Sudan's Arab Moslem majority
in the north and the Christian, animist minority in the south _ has
driven almost 2 million people toward the north and east into
Ethiopia.
   Fighting in the countryside forced the population to abandon
farming and cattle-breeding, to trek to government-controlled
cities and subsist on relief food, where war or bad weather often
blocks the delivery of supplies.
   Western relief officials say about a million southerners have
gathered in and around the capital of Khartoum, about 350,000 in
western Ethiopia and half a million in the rest of Sudan.
   Among those living at the edge of death are about 150,000 people
in Kordofan and Darfur, areas just north of the southern battle
zone. An estimated 10,000 have starved to death there during the
summer.
   The tragedy has prompted a $1 million airlift financed by the
U.S. Agency for International Development to the small village of
Abyei, 500 miles southwest of Khartoum, where relief officials say
10 people are dying every day. The 10-day airlift was half-finished
on Monday.
   Wannop, the U.N. development specialist, said relief
organizations plan to use the first $50 million relief to move
displaced people about 200,000 to 300,000 people from Kordofan and
Darfur toward their southern homelands but out of the reach of the
fighting.
   This would keep more refugees from inundating Khartoum, he said,
where about 1 million people are living in tin-and-canvas shanty
towns after scores have died in floods.
   Sudan's minister of public communications, Taj el-Sir Mustafa,
said the two-year relief plan he accepted Monday was based on
surveys conducted during field work by World Bank experts.
   The program will be presented to donor countries and
contributors next month, he said.
   Mustafa and Western experts said the study found the heavy rains
will help the economy in many ways. The rain ended an 8-year-old
drought, and the minister said Sudanese farmers should have bumper
harvests this year, with almost 10 times as much land under
cultivation as during the drought.

<HEAD>Official Says Vietnam Shifting Toward Capitalism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam is attempting to reverse a
deterioration in living standards by adopting a market-oriented
approach to its economy and by attempting to attract foreign
investment, a member of Vietnam's National Assembly said Monday.
   Nguyen Xuan Oanh, who also is a key economic adviser to the
Vietnamese government, said a major impetus to the economic policy
changes is the ``exploding'' growth rates of most capitalist
economies in East Asia.
   Speaking to a luncheon gathering at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, a private research group, Oanh acknowledged
that Vietnam is one of the poorest countries in the world.
   Oanh, who once taught at two American universities and was an
official of both the International Monetary Fund and the South
Vietnamese government, said Vietnam is moving away from a centrally
planned economy in order to ``free the forces of production.''
   He added that the foreign investment code is extremely liberal
because Vietnam is entering the competition for outside business
``quite late in the game'' and more advantageous terms are required.
   Oanh has conferred with U.S. business executives during his
visit to the United States. But American investment in Vietnam is
forbidden by a U.S. trade embargo against that country.
   Visits by Vietnamese officials to the United States have been
rare. A State Department official, asking not to be identified,
said Oanh's visit apparently was part of Hanoi's policy of trying
to expand ties to the West. He is in the United States at the
invitation of several academic institutions.
   Vietnam is one of a handful of countries with which the United
States does not maintain diplomatic relations.
   Official U.S.-Vietnamese contacts have been limited mostly to
humanitarian issues. The United States has said there can be no
progress on developing political relations until Vietnam pulls its
troops out of Cambodia and Hanoi gives as full accounting as
possible of the estimated 1,700 American servicemen still missing
from the Vietnam War.
   Oanh reaffirmed Vietnam's intention to withdraw from Cambodia
and said his government also is determined to do what it can to
assist on the MIA issue.
   The two countries recently initiated joint on-site inspections
in Vietnam in the search for the missing Americans.

   Jerry Lewis will play a clothing manufacturer
who gets caught up in a crime scandal in the garment district in
CBS' ``Wiseguy'' this season, executive producer Stephen J. Cannell
said Monday.
   That wasn't the only unusual bit of casting news Cannell had for
reporters at a CBS news conference. The first villain of the
season, a charismatic leader of a white supremacist sect, will be
played by Tennessee attorney Fred Dalton Thompson, best known for
his 1970s television appearances as real-life minority counsel on
the Watergate Committee.
   Thompson made his film debut in the movie ``Marie,'' starring
Sissy Spacek. Thompson played himself, the attorney for Marie
Ragghianti, the parole board chairwoman who blew the whistle on a
pardons-for-money scheme. Dalton was later cast as the head of the
CIA in the movie ``No Way Out.''
   Thompson will star in a four-episode storyline. Lewis will guest
star in the next set of episodes.
   Cannell said he decided to offer Lewis the guest shot after he
saw ``The King of Comedy'' again recently. In that film, Lewis had
a rare dramatic role as a famous talk-show host held hostage by an
aspiring comedian (Robert De Niro).

   Friends of the Earth, an international
environmental organization, has accepted a Soviet organization as
an affiliate in the first East-West linkup of such groups.
   A meeting of Friends of the Earth affiliates in Krakow, Poland
earlier this month accepted the Estonian Green Movement as an
associate member, said Geoffrey Webb, international director of the
Washington-based U.S. affiliate, Friends of the Earth-USA.
   New affiliates of London-based Friends of the Earth, which now
counts member organizations in 33 countries, normally spend a year
as ``associate'' members on probation, and the Estonian group
should become a full member next year if all goes well, Webb said.
   The Estonian Green Movement, formed only in May, is the first
environmental organization in the Soviet Union seeking links to the
West that is independent of the Soviet government or Communist
Party, said Webb.
   Two years ago, Friends of the Earth accepted the Polish Ecology
Club as a similar independent affiliate.
   Environmentalists from Latvia and Lithuania, sister Baltic
republics of the Soviet Union, and from East Germany,
Czechoslovakia and the Urkaine also attended the meeting. Latvian,
Lithuanian and Ukrainian groups could become affiliates next year,
Webb said.
   ``Perestroika made possible the Estonian group,'' said Webb.

   The following is the citation by the
Nobel Assembly for the 1988 Nobel Prize in medicine announced
Monday, and the summary of the winners' achievements as released in
an English-language statement:
   The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute has today decided
to award the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for 1988 jointly
to Sir James W. Black, Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings
for their discoveries of important principles for drug treatment.
   Summary:
   The discoveries awarded with this year's Nobel Prize in
physiology or medicine concern important principles in drug
treatment, principles that have resulted in the development of a
series of new drugs.
   Sir James W. Black realized the great pharmacotherapeutic
potential of receptor blocking drugs and developed in 1964 the
first clinically useful beta-receptor blocking drug, propranolol.
This type of drug is now being used in the treatment of coronary
heart disease (angina pectoris, myocardial infarction) and
hypertension.
   In 1972 Black characterized a new group of histamine receptors,
H2-receptors, and subsequently developed the first clinically
useful H2-receptor antagonist, cimetidine. A new principle in the
treatment of peptic ulcer was thereby introduced.
   Gertrude Elion and George Hitchings, who have collaborated since
1945, demonstrated differences in nucleic acid metabolism between
normal human cells, cancer cells, protozoa, bacteria and virus. On
the basis of such differences a series of drugs were developed that
block nucleic acid synthesis in cancer cells and noxious organisms
without damaging the normal human cells.
   Over the years Elion's and Hutchings' research philosophy has
formed the basis for development of new drugs against a variety of
diseases. During 1950-51 they developed thioguanine and
6-mercaptopurine against leukemia and pyrimethamine against
malaria. Azathioprine, a drug that prevents rejection of
transplanted organs and allopurinol which is used in the treatment
of gout were developed in 1957 and 1963, respectively.
   An important discovery was that the chemotherapeutic effects of
pyrimethamine and trimethoprim were markedly enhanced by
sulphonamides. A recent, successful application of their research
ideas is exemplified by acyclovir (1977), the first effective drug
in the treatment of herpes virus infections.

   Amal militiamen pounded the elder brother
of confessed hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi with rifle butts and beat
up three other security officers of the rival Hezbollah militia,
Shiite sources said Monday.
   Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, 27, Hezbollah's security chief, suffered
severe rib bruises from Saturday's beating, the sources said on
condition of anonymity.
   Both militias are Shiite Moslem, but Syria backs Amal, the
mainstream Shiite militia headed by Nabih Berri, and Iran backs
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Abdul-Hadi led the four Hezbollah men in a 12-member committee
that was assigned to halt a five-hour clash Saturday with Amal in
south Beirut.
   The committee also had four Amal representatives and four
officers from a Syrian army contingent in charge of south Beirut's
security, police said.
   A Hezbollah statement said on Monday, ``Hezbollah's
representatives were seized by Amal's Chiyah (district) commander
and his aides, insulted and beaten up before the Syrian brothers
stepped in and ensured their release.'' It mentioned no names.
   Police said six people were killed and 25 wounded in Saturday's
clashes with mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns.
   Abdul-Hadi is believed to have masterminded the kidnapping of
two West Germans, businessman Rudolf Cordes and engineer Alfred
Schmidt, in Beirut in January 1987 in a bid to trade them for his
brother.
   Schmidt, 47, was released Sept. 7, 1987 and Cordes, 54, was
freed Sept. 12.
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi, 24, is on trial in Frankfurt, West Germany,
on charges of air piracy and murder in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA
jetliner to Beirut. A U.S. Navy diver was killed.
   Hamadi has confessed that he was one of the hijackers but not
the one who murdered 23-year-old Robert Stethem.
   Another Hamadi brother, Abbas, was convicted by a Duesseldorf
court in April on charges related to kidnapping Schmidt and Cordes.
He was sentenced to 13 years in prison.

   A new computer system of evaluating the
production potential of dairy cows has been devised to help farmers
select only the best animals, the Agriculture Department said
Monday.
   The genetic evaluation system, called the Animal Model, takes
into account more of a cow's relatives than does the older system,
the Modified Contemporary Comparison, which has been used since
1974, the department's Agricultural Research Service reported.
   Under the new system, milk production of a cow's daughters will
be considered when the mother is being evaluated. And the
evaluation of bulls, based in part on the records of the male's
offspring, also take into account the impact of the bull's mate on
those offspring.
   The new system will be used for the first time in dairy genetic
evaluations to be prepared in July 1989, the report said. The
information then will be reported to dairy farmers, who can use it
to decide which cows and their calves to keep in the herd.
   ``With this information in hand, the farmer can select with more
accuracy the calves likely to be the most efficient milk
producers,'' the report said.

   A gunman took a 74-year-old woman hostage after
he was foiled in an attempt to steal $1 million in jewelry
belonging to the late Liberace, but police shot and killed the man
outside the entertainer's museum.
   ``I just tried to stay cool,'' said hostage Margaret Bloomberg,
who sat down to give police a clear shot at the man and escaped
unharmed in Sunday evening's incident at the Liberace Museum.
   ``The man had a bag of tools, including a crowbar, and was going
to smash into the jewelry case,'' said Dora Liberace, administrator
of the museum and sister-in-law of the late entertainer. ``He
wanted the jewelry and he came prepared to take it.''
   Mrs. Bloomberg, who has worked at the museum 10 years, was
closing the office when the man appeared, saying he wanted to
deliver a plant, Mrs. Liberace said.
   The man produced a gun, forced his way inside and refused offers
of money, Mrs. Bloomberg said.
   ``Margaret offered him the day's receipts, even offered him the
money in her purse, but he wasn't interested,'' Mrs. Liberace said.
``He said `I don't want the cash. I want the jewelry.' He obviously
had been in there before and checked out the place. He seemed to
know where everything was.''
   Mrs. Bloomberg was able to warn a cleaning woman, who slipped
out a back door and called police.
   The gunman tied Mrs. Bloomberg's hands and feet, taped her
mouth, then untied her, moved her to another part of the museum and
tied her again.
   ``He was getting ready to pop the jewelry case when he heard a
noise outside,'' Mrs. Bloomberg said. ``He went and saw the police.
I told him I'd get him out the back door. When we tried that,
police were there, too.''
   The gunman walked out the front door with a gun pointed at the
bound hostage.
   ``He told police he would shoot me if they didn't let him get to
his car,'' she recalled. ``I just tried to stay cool.''
   ``She just sat down on the sidewalk, pretending her legs had
collapsed under her,'' Mrs. Liberace said. ``He tried to lift her
in the car but couldn't. He leaned back for a minute and the police
shot him.''
   ``When I sat down I figured the police would pick him off,
maybe,'' Mrs. Bloomberg said.
   Mrs. Bloomberg, somewhat shaken and her hands still bearing
marks from the ropes, was back at work Monday.
   ``I thought I was better off working than staying at home and
dwelling on it,'' she said.
   The gunman, identified as Hugh Perry, 47, of Las Vegas, had a
lengthy arrest record dating back to the 1960s, said Metro Police
Lt. Kyle Edwards.
   The museum is one of the city's top tourist attractions,
featuring memorabilia of the entertainer who gained fame here and
retained a home not far away.
   Mrs. Liberace said the museum has one of the most sophisticated
security systems in the city but will now add guards.
   Liberace, who died in February 1987 of complications due to
AIDS, founded the museum 10 years ago to fund the Liberace
Foundation for the Performing Arts, which provides scholarships for
music and art students at 27 colleges and universities across the
United States.

   A small group of environmental activists gathered
outside George Bush's Massachusetts campaign office Monday,
denouncing the Republican presidential candidate's environmental
record and calling him a hypocrite for bad-mouthing Michael
Dukakis' role in Boston Harbor pollution.
   The group released a report compiled by a national environmental
lobby that said Bush, as vice president, took or endorsed numerous
steps that have harmed or endangered the nation's waters and
wetlands.
   ``George Bush was not an idle spectator in the Reagan
administration's assault on the environment,'' said the report by
Clean Water Action. ``Rather, for eight years, he aggressively
pursued an agenda which responded to the special interests of
polluters and resulted in massive destruction of wetlands
throughout the country.''
   The report focused on Bush's role as chairman of a regulatory
task force that rescinded or relaxed several regulations affecting
sewage treatment and wetlands protection programs.
   The group also credited Dukakis with beginning the cleanup of
Boston Harbor despite cutbacks in federal cleanup funds because of
Reagan administration cuts endorsed by Bush.

<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet spokesman on Monday refused to define the
duties of former Soviet ideology chief Yegor K. Ligachev but denied
that Ligachev or anyone else is No. 2 on the ruling Politburo.
   ``All members of the Politburo are equal and some are more equal
than others,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov, paraphrasing George Orwell's satire of communist society
in the novel ``Animal Farm.''
   But he said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has no official
second-in-command despite Western reports that Ligachev once
chaired meetings of the 12-member ruling body of the Communist
Party.
   Ligachev has been considered the top conservative rival of
Gorbachev, who is waging a campaign for economic and political
reform.
   ``What you call No. 2 doesn't exist,'' Gerasimov told reporters
at a government news briefing.
   Still, Ligachev appeared Monday at Gorbachev's right side at the
opening of a national conference of doctors in the Kremlin.
   Gerasimov left strong doubts whether Ligachev came out of a
recent Politburo power play with control over agriculture,
traditionally the nation's toughest assignment.
   After being deprived of the key ideology portfolio this year,
Ligachev was named chairman of a new Central Committee commission
on agriculture in a shake-up of the Kremlin leadership Sept. 30.
   Since the core of the powerful Central Committee apparatus will
consist of just six of these commissions, the job was hardly a
removal from power, but it clearly gave Ligachev less clout than
his former post as overseer of ideology.
   Gerasimov hedged when he was asked point-blank who is
controlling agriculture _ Ligachev, or fellow Politburo member
Viktor P. Nikonov, who had that job before the shake-up.
   ``It is the commission'' that will run agriculture, Gerasimov
said.
   Specific duties are still evolving, and those of Ligachev and
Nikonov have yet to be defined, he said.
   At a similar briefing several days ago, Gerasimov promised to
explain what Ligachev's and Nikonov's new duties are.
   Last week, Ligachev was notably absent from an important
agriculture conference where Gorbachev edged closer to dismantling
the collective farm system controlled from Moscow with a plan to
allow farmers to lease fields nationwide.
   Gerasimov said Ligachev was on vacation during the meeting and
that he didn't have to be present for all discussions of farm
issues.
   Ligachev has publicly doubted Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
openness on selected topics. He was reported losing his grip on
power and the ideology job in April, when reports said he was ``on
vacation'' after receiving a reprimand from Gorbachev.
   The former party bureaucrat from Siberia rose to the
policy-making Central Committee and a key job assigning party
personnel under former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov in 1983. He
joined the Politburo in 1985.
   Nikonov is an agriculture expert with roots in Gorbachev's home
soil in southern Russia, and his career climbed with Gorbachev's.
When Gorbachev became party chief for agriculture in 1978, Nikonov
became deputy Soviet minister for agriculture, essentially a top
aide in the parallel government bureaucracy.

<HEAD>Too Many Mickeys in Moscow, Disney Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roy Disney met Mickey Mouse in Moscow this
weekend, but it was the wrong rodent.
   ``A bad copy,'' Disney said ruefully Monday, describing the
costumed figure who has been enticing parents into ordering
pictures of their children from a state photographer on the Arbat
pedestrian mall.
   Such counterfeiting is a big obstacle keeping Soviet children
from enjoying the same Disney fantasies as their foreign
counterparts.
   A Soviet festival of Disney films is playing in Moscow but it
won't expand beyond that until the counterfeiting issue is solved,
said Disney, a vice chairman of the company.
   Disney films have not been shown in the Soviet Union since a
lone appearance in a film festival 50 years ago, according to
Soviet media. Yet, the company's cartoon characters are popular
motifs for Soviet fashion. Unfortunately for Disney, none of the
manufacturers has paid a penny in royalties.
   ``We need to talk it out,'' Disney said. Soviet officials are
aware that Disney requires protection of its ``intellectual
property'' through copyrights or similar means, he added.
   Disney would like to show its films, sell Mickey ears and
publish its familiar books and music in the Soviet Union, he said.
But Disney added that he expects no concrete deals on this visit,
because the intellectual property issue must be settled first.
   Disney is discussing possible joint productions with the Soviet
film agency, but this requires a story best filmed in the Soviet
Union, Disney said.
   Soviet officials said earlier they were discussing Disney
involvement in building ``Wonderland,'' a planned theme park.
   In answer to a question, however, Disney said he doubted his
company would ever build a Soviet version of Disneyland.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Bill Regulating Indian Gambling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Monday signed legislation
setting up a commission to regulate and monitor high-stakes
gambling on Indian reservations.
   The legislation provides for joint regulation by the tribes and
the federal government of bingo, lotto, and certain card games. It
would permit casinos, and horse and dog racing on reservations only
if the tribes enter into specific contracts with state governments.
   Indian tribes, faced with cutbacks in federal money and a
limited tax base, have instituted gambling operations to raise
needed revenues. Bingo is the predominant, but not the only, form
of gambling.
   Bingo, lotto, and card games will be monitored by the National
Indian Gaming Commission to be established. Card games will be
subject to state regulations regarding hours of play and betting
limits.
   Other forms of gambling, including casinos, horse and dog
racing, and jai-alai, will require tribes to enter into compacts
with the states.
   The national commission will be composed of five people, three
of whom must be members of federally recognized tribes. The
president would appoint the chairman, who would need Senate
confirmation.
   The commission is empowered under the act to close tribal games
permanently, enforce the collection of fines, conduct background
investigations of employees, and monitor all Indian gaming
activities.
   The measure also authorizes $2 million for the first year of the
commission's operation, and requires that its operation be financed
at least 50 percent by the tribes, through assessments on gaming
revenues. The remainder would be paid by federal appropriations.

   Lawyers representing 24 Britons charged
with involuntary manslaughter in a 1985 fatal soccer riot appealed
Monday for a fair trial as the proceedings opened.
   Families of some of the 39 people killed in the Heysel stadium
riot attended the trial, which was interrupted twice by bomb
threats.
   ``This trial must restore the honor which Belgium lost in the
Heysel stadium,'' said defense lawyer Serge Moureaux. ``It must be
a fair trial. The court should not try to choke the truth. Justice
must repair everything.''
   Also present were some of the survivors of the riot, which
injured 400 people. One Frenchman, who refused to identify himself,
said outside the courtroom that he survived the stampede and added:
``When I see them (the British fans) laughing, I could kill them.''
   The stampede began when the fence separating British and Italian
fans at the European Cup soccer final between Liverpool and
Juventuis Turin broke, Britons charged, Italians retreated in panic
and the 39 were trampled to death.
   Belgian police forces were blamed for their incapacity to quell
the riot. Moureaux quoted a Belgian state police sergeant as
telling investigators: ``I never saw such a lack of command.''
   The incident provoked the resignation of Belgian government
several months later.
   Moureaux quoted a Belgian state police sergeant as telling
investigators: ``I never saw such a lack of command.''
   The sergeant reportedly added that he saw a police officer run
away from the riots.
   Another defense lawyer, Georges-Henri Beauthier, asked the court
president to reject videocassettes of the incident. He also
rejected the alleged identification by Italian witnesses of the
defendents from photographs.
   ``We fear the immolation of a few of our clients on the altar of
collective frenzy,'' he said. ``We don't find it good and
comfortable to condemn a few people chosen at random from films to
reassure public opinion.''
   The defendents, if convicted, face up to 10 years in jail. The
proceedings are expected to last at least until Christmas.
   English soccer clubs have been banned competing in Europe's
three main cup tournaments since the riot.
   In Ascoli, Italy, on Monday, a 32-year-old soccer fan died from
head injuries received in clashes between rival fans on the opening
day of the Italian soccer season Oct. 9, doctors reported.
Nazzareno Filippini succumbed to heart complications which followed
two operations on his skull, the attending physicians at Umberto
Primo Hospital said.
   On Sunday, rioting broke out among hundreds of gate crashers at
an overcrowded soccer game in Cairo, Egypt, that had been blacked
out on local television. One person was killed and 50 injured,
police said.

<HEAD>Survey Suggests Millions of U.S. Children May Suffer Hunger</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A house-to-house survey of nearly 800
low-income families in Washington state suggests that as many as 5
million of America's children suffer from hunger, a private
activist group said Monday.
   The Food Research And Action Center is extending the study to
seven other states over the next 15 months. But on the basis of the
early data from Washington state ``... we estimate conservatively
that 2 million to 5 million children in this country could now have
a serious hunger problem,'' said Robert J. Fersh, executive
director of the center.
   ``We believe that this estimate is conservative because it
attempts only to estimate the number of children living in poverty
who might be hungry,'' said Fersh. ``It does not include any
children from families with incomes above the poverty line who
might be hungry.''
   At the same time, Fersh acknowledged that he has no way of
knowing whether the survey results in Washington state will be
replicated in larger studies.
   Similar studies are now under way in Minnesota, Florida,
Connecticut, California, Michigan, Alabama and New York.
   The survey techiques were first used in a 1986 survey in
Connecticut and refined for the Washington state and ongoing
studies, all of which involve selecting low-income families at
random and then conducting face-to-face interviews that take about
45 minutes each.
   The responses given by mothers to a lengthy questionnaire are
correlated with other information such as family income and what,
if any, public assistance such as food stamps they receive.
   Among the questions: Does your household ever run out of money
to buy food to make a meal? Do your children ever eat less than you
feel they should because there is not enough money for food?
   A respondent had to answer ``yes'' to at least five such
questions before being placed in the hunger category.
   Dr. Victor Sidel, a professor of social medicine at the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, headed the Food
Research and Action Center's technical advisory committee and said
the survey techniques used are the best yet developed for measuring
hunger.
   ``The evidence is in. The evidence is clear. The evidence is
scientific,'' he said.
   Sidel emphasized that the kind of hunger seen among America's
children is not of the dramatic, life-threatening variety common in
African countries.
   But he said there are ``other kinds of medical and physical
consequences'' inexcusable in a country as rich as the United
States.
   ``It is a violation of equality of opportunity to force (poor)
children to go to school hungry,'' said Sidel.
   Fersh said one major finding of the Washington state study is
that it shows ``people do not supplement to the extent the food
stamp program assumes'' the amount of assistance they get from that
particular Agriculture Department program.
   The reason, he said, is that they are paying ever higher prices
for rent, child care and medical costs. ``The food budget is the
most elastic,'' he said, and that is what is cut first.
   Washington state was not singled out because hunger was believed
better or worse, but as an outgrowth of the Governor's Task Force
on Hunger created there in 1986 to try to document the extent and
nature of hunger in the state.
   The Food Action Research Center relies on the support of
foundations, religious groups, corporations, individuals and others
to carry out its hunger and poverty programs.

<TEXT>
   Guerrillas continued fighting government
troops at camps near the Thai border Monday after capturing several
hills controlled by the military regime, a government spokesman
said.
   The ethnic Karen guerrillas first attacked the camps near
Methawaw, about 130 miles northeast of Rangoon, on Sept. 26. Since
then, they have killed 35 government soldiers, including one
officer, and wounded 95, said government spokesman Kyaw Sann. Three
others were missing, he said.
   Rebel casualties were believed heavy, but a count was not
possible because the guerrillas dragged away their dead and
wounded, Kyaw Sann said.
   Methawaw is on the west bank of the Moei River, which forms the
border between Burma and Thailand.
   The Karens, who are fighting for the autonomy of an area along
the border, form the strongest of Burma's dozen insurgencies.
Karens represent about 2 million of Burma's 38 million people.
   Kyaw Sann said about 1,000 guerrillas were involved in the
attacks near Methawaw. The guerrillas said they recaptured several
hills Wednesday in an area government forces had seized more than
four years ago.
   Kyaw Sann said government troops also attacked two other Karen
strongholds, at Maela on Oct. 9 and at Wangkha on Oct. 13. Seven
soldiers were killed and 24 were injured, and fierce fighting
continued at Wangkha on Monday, he said.
   Kyaw Sann also said students who recently fled to the border
areas to join the guerrillas must return by Nov. 18 or they will be
regarded as rebels. He said the government has established
``reception centers'' at 27 towns in areas bordering Bangladesh,
India, China, and Thailand.
   ``The government regarded these students as youths misled and
gone astray,'' he said. ``They will be welcomed at reception
centers where they will be well looked after before sending them
back to their respective homes. We will have to regard them as
rebels after the deadline of Nov. 18.''
   Officials of various rebel groups say more than 9,000 students
and other civilians have arrived at rebel camps since military
commander Gen. Saw Maung seized power in Rangoon Sept. 18 and
crushed pro-democracy demonstrations in the cities.
   Radio Rangoon announced that two more political parties
registered Monday, bringing to 20 the number formed after Saw
Maung's coup.
   The two parties, the Peoples Volunteer Organization and the
Democratic Progressive Allies Party, have elderly leaders who were
politically active before Burma achieved its independence in 1948.

<TEXT>
   Government researchers are investigating whether
as many as 20,000 people who lived near the Hanford nuclear
reservation in Washington state in the 1940s and early 1950s were
contaminated by radioactive spills.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control said the leakage over
about nine years of several radioactive elements, especially Iodine
131, apparently is the most massive radioactive leak of any
facility in the country.
   The reservation opened in 1944 and produced the plutonium for
the atom bomb that destroyed Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945.
   ``A lot of Iodine 131 was released into the atmosphere at
Hanford,'' said Dr. Dan Hoffman, assistant director of the CDC's
Center for Environmental Health and Injury Control, which is doing
the study.
   He said research in Utah and the Marshall Islands in the Pacific
indicated Iodine 131 can cause thyroid problems.
   Records of the Hanford leak and the size of the dose were not
released until a Spokane, Wash., environmental group obtained them
in 1986 under the Freedom of Information Act.
   Congress last month authorized the study, which Hoffman said may
take 5 years and cost up to $6 million.
   He said there is no proof yet that there have been long-range
damaging effects from the radiation spill.
   ``It's all anecdotal so far,'' he said. ``The most difficult
task will be to find the people, to reassemble the populations and
try and track them down.''
   He said the CDC will use birth and school records to try to find
people who lived downwind, to the west, of the nuclear reservation
in Richland in southeastern Washington state.
   ``That will be our hardest job,'' he said. ``I imagine they have
spread out all over the place.''
   He said Iodine 131 has a radioactive half-life of only eight
days, thus deteriorates quickly and does not linger in the
environment and remain a problem. Some radioactive materials are
thought to remain dangerous for centuries.
   The Department of Energy, which owns the reservation, also is
trying to determine the size of the dose nearby residents may have
received.
   There are nine nuclear reactors at Hanford and eight are closed
permanently. The ninth was placed on ``cold standby'' earlier this
year after the Energy Department decided not to restart it after
safety improvements were completed. A plutonium processing plant
continues to operate.
   Last May, about 50 people who lived near Hanford met in Spokane
to discuss possible related health problems.
   June Casey of Oakland, Calif., a student at Whitman College in
Walla Walla in December 1949, when high levels of Iodine 131 were
released, said she soon developed an underactive thyroid and lost
her hair, which never grew back.
   Lois Camp, a third-generation farmer who grew up near Hanford,
said she and her entire family had been stricken with thyroid and
cancer problems.
   She said she has had cancer twice in the past eight years and
that her oldest son developed a bone tumor two years ago.

<TEXT>
   A researcher experimenting with a new,
more sensitive test for the AIDS virus said Monday that the virus
does not appear to be carried in sperm cells.
   That discovery could eventually mean that men with AIDS could
father children by separating their sperm cells from infected semen
and using those cells for artificial insemination.
   Semen, which is ejaculated, is made up of both sperm cells and
seminal fluid.
   But Dr. Bernard Poisez, a researcher at the State University of
New York Health Science Center at Syracuse, said it's a discovery
that needs more study.
   ``All we're saying is that we have a test that's so good we can
detect these things and now we need to do some very carefully
conducted clinical tests,'' Poisez said.
   He said he wouldn't recommend that men infected with AIDS
attempt to pursue fatherhood through artificial insemination and he
doesn't think fertility clinics or in vitro centers would agree to
try this without further testing.
   Poisez said determining whether the AIDS virus is carried inside
a sperm cell is one of many studies to exploit a new means of
testing for the AIDS virus.
   The new technique, developed by Cetus Corp. of Emeryville,
Calif., uses a chemical reaction, called a polymerase chain
reaction, to amplify genetic material _ such as that from the AIDS
virus _ a million times, making it easier to detect. Poisez said
the test is faster, more accurate and cheaper than some current
AIDS tests.
   Another finding with the new test, Poisez said, is a decline in
the number of men with AIDS who have the virus in their semen.
Other researchers using the test have documented similar findings,
he said.
   Poisez said he has looked at 500 semen samples over the past
four or five years, and that over that period, even with a more
sensitive test, the number of samples containing the virus has
fallen.
   Initially, about 75 percent of the men had the virus in their
semen, but recently Poisez said researchers have found the virus in
just 20 percent of homosexual men who had similar characteristics
as the initial group.
   ``We think this is because they have fewer white blood cells in
their semen,'' said Poisez. ``As a result of safe sex and better
care, we believe the amount of infections and level of inflammation
has been reduced.''
   Without the infections and inflammations, the number of white
blood cells decreases, Poisez said.
   This is another finding that needs to be studied, but Poisez
said it could eventually mean that researchers could determine when
it's especially dangerous to have even safe sex.
   He said researchers at the State Health Center are currently
studying whether the test can be used to determine:
   _ how effective about six or seven AIDS-fighting drugs are by
measuring how quickly they are reducing the number of AIDS-infected
cells in the body.
   _ whether some mothers infected with AIDS would be better
candidates for pre-natal use of AIDS-fighting drugs.
   _ If there are particular times when it's more likely for an
unusually large number of AIDS-infected cells to be present in the
semen.

and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen said in a statement. ``A
variety of traditional and nontraditional facilities received the
funds, which are to be regarded as seed money.''
   With nearly 300,000 people expected to be suffering from AIDS
within three years _ compared with about 75,000 diagnosed so far _
a major challenge facing the health care industry is for
cost-effective ways to care for such patients.
   AIDS sufferers often are not in constant need of the costly care
supplied by acute-care hospitals, yet are too sick to be cared for
at home.
   The grants announced Monday were to 19 facilities in nine states
to renovate or construct non-acute care intermediate and long-term
care facilities for patients with AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   The nine states are Arizona, California, Indiana, Maryland,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Texas and Washington.
   Bowen said the grant recipients had to guarantee that a
reasonable volume of services would be provided to patients unable
to pay and that services must be made available to all people
living or working in a facility's service area.
   The grant receipients are:
   _Phoenix Shanti Group, Inc., Phoenix, Ariz., $369,000.
   _Barlow Hospital, Los Angeles, $300,000.
   _Davies Medical Center, San Francisco, $605,858.
   _San Francisco Department of Public Health, $355,952.
   _AIDS Task Force, Inc., Fort Wayne, Ind., $100,000.
   _Earthide, Inc., Baltimore, Md., $61,268.
   _Boston Department of Health and Hospitals, $250,000.
   _St. John of God Hospital, Brighton, Mass., $350,000.

<HEAD>Goetz Seeks To Overturn Conviction On Gun Charge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for subway gunman Bernhard Goetz
asked the state's highest court Monday to give weight to ``little
words'' and overturn a gun possession conviction stemming from his
1984 shooting of four teen-agers.
   Attorney Mark Baker told the New York Court of Appeals that
state Supreme Court Justice Stephen Crane's charge to jurors last
year that they ``must'' convict if they found the prosecution had
proven its case, amounted to taking away the jury's
constitutionally granted discretion. Baker said the judge should
have used the word ``may.''
   ``That's what this profession is all about, much ado about
little words,'' Baker said after his court appearance. ``The word
`must' to a conscientious jury precludes it from perhaps exercising
its own discretion.''
   However, during the hearing, Judge Joseph Bellacosa questioned
Baker about the possibility that judges might be giving jurors a
show-mercy message with ``a wink and a nod'' if they didn't tell
them of their duty to convict if the case against the defendant had
been proved.
   Gregory Waples, an assistant district attorney in New York City,
raised the same concern in arguing that Goetz's conviction should
be upheld. Waples said that for trial judges to be forced to use
``may'' instead of ``must'' would be ``a red flag in some cases for
jurors to decide cases on their personal predilections and contrary
to the rule of law.''
   Baker said that if juries weren't allowed to have some
discretion, ``then we don't need a jury, we need a computer.''
   Goetz, who was not at Monday's hearing, can't expect a decision
from the Court of Appeals for several weeks.
   Goetz, an electronics technician, was convicted in June 1987 of
third-degree criminal possession of a weapon in connection with the
December 1984 shooting aboard a subway train of four black youths
he said were trying to rob him. The youths, who all survived, said
they were simply panhandling for money.
   Goetz was acquitted of all other charges against him.
   Goetz's case drew national attention with supporters claiming he
was a hero who reacted properly to a wave of subway and street
crime. Opponents complained that his supporters were glorifying
vigilantism.
   A year ago this week, Crane sentenced Goetz to six months in
jail, 280 hours of community service, five years probation and
psychiatric counseling, and fined him $5,000.
   On the initial appeal of Goetz's conviction, a lower state court
refused to throw out the conviction, but did order that Goetz be
re-sentenced on the prison portion of his penalty.
   The Appellate Division of state Supreme Court said Goetz should
have been given an indeterminate sentence or, under terms of New
York's tough gun-control law, a one-year term with no probation.
   While Goetz's attorneys have fought to have the conviction
itself overturned and get a new trial on the weapons possession
charge, they have favored a one-year jail term rather than six
months. Because of a quirk in New York's law, the six-month
sentence meant Goetz would have had to serve at least four months
before he could be released, while with a one-year sentence he
could have been freed after just two months.
   Baker said Goetz is ``trying to get on with his life'' and
``does travel around the country servicing his clients'' as an
electronics expert.
   He said that while Goetz still rides the subway, he probably
doesn't carry a gun.
   ``I certainly hope not,'' said Baker. ``I don't want to have to
go through this again.''

   Two North Carolina
researchers who won the Nobel prize for medicine Monday said the
best reward for their work was seeing people overcome disease with
the medicines they developed.
   ``There's nothing that gives you a lift like seeing somebody get
better from a serious disease,'' said biochemist Gertrude B. Elion.
``The Nobel is something that is going to disappear in a few days.
But the other (seeing patients recover) is permanent.
   ``Not taking anything away from the Nobel prize, but the prize
is recognition, not reward,'' she said. ``The reward is seeing the
improvement your work makes.''
   ``I'm pleased more for my descendants than I am for myself,''
said George H. Hitchings, a colleague of Ms. Elion's at Wellcome
Research Laboratories Inc. ``I've had a lot of honors, but the most
important honors for me have been meeting patients whose lives have
been saved or whose children's lives have been saved by drugs I've
invented.''
   Hitchings, 83, and Ms. Elion, 70, began collaborating 44 years
ago, and have developed drugs for use against leukemia, malaria,
gout, organ transplant rejection, herpes virus infections and
bacterial infections. Both carry the title scientist emeritus and
are officially retired but come to the lab daily.
   The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute said their ideas also
paved the way for development of azidothymidine, or AZT, which is
the best documented drug so far in the treatment of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome and the only one approved for use in the United
States.
   The two North Carolina scientists share the $390,000 prize with
Sir James W. Black of King's College Hospital Medical School in
London. His research led to a beta blocker drug for heart disease
and a drug for peptic ulcers.
   Ms. Elion said she had not known she had been nominated for the
prize and had never seriously considered that she might win it.
   ``The only people who thought I might get it was my family,''
she said. ``When I got the first call from a reporter about 6:30
a.m., I told him I thought it was a practical joke and not a very
funny one.''
   Although she officially retired five years ago, she makes daily
trips to Burroughs Wellcome to consult with other researchers.
   ``What's the use of retiring?'' she said. ``If you don't have
anything to contribute anymore, people will tell you. But as long
as you can make a contribution, you should.''
   Ms. Elion has worked at Wellcome Research Laboratories since
1944 and as a senior research chemist since 1950. Since 1983, she
has been a scientist emeritus at the laboratory and a research
professor of pharmacology at Duke University.
   Hitchings, after teaching at Harvard and Western Reserve
University, joined Burroughs Wellcome in 1942. He became its
research director in 1955 and retired in 1975 as vice president for
research. He was a director of the company from 1968 to 1984 and is
president of the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, a non-profit organization
that supports academic research.

   The Bethel Home for Children is back in
business as a religious boarding school for troubled youths, four
months after the state tried to take custody of its students
because of reports of abuse.
   Some of the children who had been under the care of the Rev.
Herman Fountain, a former heroin addict turned independent Baptist
pastor, have returned since the June confrontations, and a few new
students have enrolled.
   Religious boarding homes aren't regulated under Mississippi law,
but several lawmakers concerned about schools like Fountain's say
they'll offer various licensing and registration bills when the
Legislature convenes in January.
   No charges have been filed against anyone at Bethel in
connection with the allegations of abuse and neglect. However,
several children's testimony of abusive practices resulted in their
removal from Fountain's custody.
   Next week, a grand jury will consider whether to charge Fountain
with assaulting law officers when they stormed his church and took
custody of some of his students.
   A girl answering the telephone Monday at the Bethel Home for
Children said Fountain was out working and unavailable for comment.
   Fountain has claimed his right to freedom of religion exempts
him from any state oversight, and says there's nothing wrong with
his ``spare the rod, spoil the child'' view of discipline.
   However, state welfare officers were ordered June 10 to take
custody of the residents of Fountain's home and school, on a
28-acre compound outhside the southern Mississippi town of
Lucedale. The order came from a Youth Court judge looking into
several allegations of beatings and other abuse.
   Some state officials say Fountain told the children to flee
before welfare officers arrived; he denies this. However, many of
the youths _ there were up to 120 at Bethel, according to Fountain
_ took off, and law officers spent several days rounding them up
from the streets.
   Fountain says 50 troubled youths have never been accounted for
and he fears they are roaming the streets as prostitutes or drug
dealers.
   On June 13, law officers stormed Fountain's locked church to
take custody of some of the children who had fled three days
before. Several witnesses, including members of the news media, saw
Fountain swing at officers during the incident.
   A Circuit Court grand jury will consider whether to bring three
counts of felony assault on a law officer against Fountain. The
pastor has been free on bond pending the grand jury session.
   He has appealed a separate disorderly conduct conviction in
Justice Court, for which he was fined $200.
   A civil contempt hearing involving Fountain's refusal to give
Youth Court authorities a list of names of children who had lived
at his home is set for Oct. 25 in Chancery Court at Lucedale, a
clerk said.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Monday praised Roman
Catholic schools for teaching young people spiritual values as well
as the educational basics.
   Addressing students of two parochial high schools in northeast
Washington, Reagan said ``it amazes me that while you are exploring
the mysteries of God's love and all that goes with it ... others
around the nation deny the public importance of the private virtues
you are mastering.''
   Reagan, accompanied by Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos,
visited Archbishop Carroll High School, where students of that
school were gathered in a gymnasium with students from All Saints
High School.
   The president said he believes the government should do more to
help parents who wish to send their children to parochial schools.
   ``Catholic schools across America are showing that private
virtue and public interest do indeed live together,'' he said. ``I
know that your parents all make great sacrifices so that you can
come here. ... For years, I have been urging Congress to allow your
parents to support your education either through tuition tax
credits or vouchers.''
   ``We need a Congress that shares and supports the values of the
American people,'' he said.
   Reagan praised the young people for preparing themselves for
leadership positions in the future.
   ``Isn't that because you are not only learning the ABCs but also
about right and wrong, good and evil, and the nature of God's
love?'' he said.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Rules Comatose Patient May Have Feeding Tubes
Removed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A comatose woman has a constitutional
right to have her feeding tubes removed, despite objections by a
state attorney that she would starve to death, a federal judge
ruled Monday.
   An individual has a constitutional right to control fundamental
medical decisions affecting one's own body, even if that will
result in death, U.S. District Judge Francis J. Boyle said.
   ``Medical ethics incorporates the principle that the patient,
not the health care provider, determines what the course of care
should be,'' the judge said.
   Marcia Gray, 49, has been in a coma since Jan. 4, 1986, when a
blood vessel burst in her brain. She had told her husband and
relatives on several occasions that, if stricken, she would not
want to be kept alive by artificial means, Boyle's opinion noted.
   Although she breathes on her own, doctors agree she suffered
massive brain damage and is in a ``persistent vegetative state,''
Boyle's decision said.
   The case attracted national attention last year when Bishop
Louis E. Gelineau of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence
approved a theologian's opinion that it was morally permissible to
withdraw Mrs. Gray's nourishment. That opinion, which has been
criticized by other moral theologians, said Mrs. Gray's feeding was
``circumventing'' the dying process.
   Her husband and guardian, H. Glenn Gray, asked to have her
feeding tube removed in March 1987. Officials of Rhode Island
Medical Center General Hospital, which is run by the Department of
Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals, refused, setting up the
state's first legal test of a patient's right to die.
   Mrs. Gray has a constitutional right to privacy, and ``the right
to protect one's bodily integrity,'' Linda A. MacDonald, attorney
for the Gray family, argued at a June hearing.
   John L.P. Breguet, the state's attorney, argued that no federal
constitutional issues were involved and, even if they were,
implementation of those standards was ``really up to the individual
states to decide.''
   Boyle said an argument by Breguet that Mrs. Gray would suffer a
painful death was ``hollow in light of the medical testimony that
Marcia Gray is incapable of suffering any sensation, including
pain.''
   Boyle ruled that if Mrs. Gray cannot be promptly transferred to
a health care facility that will respect her wishes, General
Hospital must remove the feeding tubes.
   General Hospital will try to find another facility to accept
Mrs. Gray, and failing that, will consider appealing the decision,
Breguet said Monday after speaking with MHRH Director Thomas D.
Romeo, who was the defendant in the lawsuit.

   Iran's foreign minister said Monday his
country would accept a United Nations formula for implementing a
peace pact in its 8-year war with Iraq but on one condition, the
official Iranian news agency reported.
   The report by the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Foreign
Minister Ali Akhbar Velayati as saying the condition is that a 1975
accord that placed the southern border between the two countries as
running through the middle of the Shatt al-Arab waterway be
maintained.
   The dispatch, monitored in Nicosia, said U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar proposed the compromise plan and listed its
four points as: withdrawal of all forces to international
boundaries; agreement not to search ships in the Persian Gulf;
exchange of prisoners of war, and dredging of the Shatt al-Arab.
   The dispute over the estuary, which is Iraq's only waterway
access to the gulf, was a key issue in the war.
   Peace talks that started Aug. 25 stalled quickly over Iraq's
insistence that the Shatt al-Arab be dredged. Iran claimed that was
a secondary issue that could be settled later.
   Peace negotiations are scheduled to resume later this month in
Geneva.
   There was no immediate reaction from Iraq to the Iranian
announcement, but Iraq rejected the 1975 treaty years ago. Iran
insists that the pact, known as the Algiers Treaty, is valid.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein tore up a copy of the 1975 treaty
in a televised broadcast five days before his troops invaded Iran
in September 1980.
   Velayati was quoted as saying Monday that ``future peace talks
in Geneva will be fruitful if Iraq relents its current obstinacy
and is ready to cooperate for the implementation of the U.N.
chief's plan.''
   The agency said Velayati made the comments at a news conference
at the Foreign Ministry.
   It reported Velayati also made these statement on other matters:
   _Iran will not change its policy toward the United States as
long as Washington continues its ``hostile behavior'' toward Iran.
   _Talks with Britain about restoring relations were continuing
and ``cannot be said to have reached a deadlock.''
   _``Some difficulties'' exist in relations with Saudi Arabia,
which in April severed diplomatic relations with Iran, accusing it
of supporting terrorists.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski on
Monday told the first meeting of his Cabinet that the new
government begins its work ``in conditions of substantial
disorder.''
   ``Only palpable, measurable effects of improvement can overcome
the attitude of hopelessness in society,'' Rakowski said, according
to a report by the PAP news agency.
   It said Rakowski also declared that law and order must be
maintained and accused anti-government protesters who demonstrated
Sunday of trying to block planned talks between the communist
authorities and the opposition.
   Rakowski became prime minister Sept. 27 and his Cabinet was
approved by the Sejm, or parliament, last Friday.
   Polish television broadcast scenes of hundreds of pro-Solidarity
demonstrators marching Sunday in the port city of Gdansk _
birthplace of the now-outlawed independent trade union movement _
and then demonstrators hurling stones at riot police.
   Rakowski said: ``The government holds the opinion that the
manifestations of political adventurism ... were provocations aimed
at torpedoing national agreement,'' PAP reported.
   Such incidents ``drastically disturb the atmosphere'' before the
promised round-table discussions, he said, adding:
   ``The government discussed indispensable measures to counteract
attempts at destabilizing the country and to enforce law and public
order.''
   Round-table talks that would include the topics of trade unions
and political and economic reforms had been expected to begin this
week, but disagreements over the way they would be conducted and
who would participate have forced a delay, said Andrzej
Stelmachowski, a mediator attempting to arrange the discussions.
   The government has said Solidarity representatives would not be
allowed to participate.
   Other opposition leaders turned down offers to join the new
government pending results of the talks, but PAP said Rakowski told
his Cabinet the government would carry out reforms before the
negotiations begin.
   It reported he said restructuring the economy ``must be
radicalized and accelerated,'' market supplies increased and price
increases curbed.
   Economic reform will mean that ``people who want to work better
... can count on increased incomes,'' he said.
   Referring to strikes that shook Poland in May and August,
Rakowski said, ``The sources of conflicts have not disappeared.
Thus, the welfare of workers and all working people, their needs
and perceptions, must remain at the center of the government's
attention.''
   Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, head of the communist party and
Poland's top leader, attended the meeting and called the new
Cabinet ``a government of great opportunity,'' according to PAP.
   It reported the general spoke of ``various kinds of
provocation'' but said authorities remain ``fully and deeply
convinced about the necessity for reconciliation.''

   The U.S. bases agreement with the Philippines
for the first time explicitly bans American soldiers and sailors
who test positive for AIDS from serving in another country.
   State Department officials said Monday it was the first time
such a provision was included in a bases agreement. It also may
ease a dispute with Manila over reported cases of the infectious
disease among bar hostesses.
   Pentagon policy since January 1987 has barred overseas
assignments for service personnel who test positive for acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Testing of recruits began in
October 1986.
   Soldiers or sailors with AIDS may remain in the service, within
the United States, unless and until they show symptoms of the
disease. At that point, they are honorably discharged.
   Under a section of the bases agreement dealing with AIDS as a
``social issue'':
   _The two governments affirmed their ``common concern over the
global problem'' of AIDS and ``their common interest in the
prevention and control of this disease.''
   _The two governments agreed to exchange ``releasable
information'' on the incidence of the infection.
   _The U.S. government pledged that U.S. military personnel who
tested positive would not be assigned abroad.
   _The two governments agreed to have a committee look into ways
to cooperate in prevention, education, testing, detection and
control.

<HEAD>Administration OKs Use of Temporary-Hire Firms at Federal Agencies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration on Monday proposed
allowing understaffed government agencies to hire temporary
employee services to fill short-term manpower needs in peak service
periods and as substitutes for absent federal workers.
   Reversing a two-decade policy that banned use of temporary help
suppliers except for a few rare instances, the Office of Personnel
Management said the new policy will increase agencies' flexibility
in times and areas of labor shortages.
   The new policy, published Monday in the Federal Register and
scheduled to become effective in December or January, amends
rulings in 1967 and 1968 that effectively prohibited using
temporary help firms as a violation of civil service laws.
   OPM Director Constance Horner, in an address Monday to the
National Association of Temporary Services at its convention in
Phoenix, Ariz., contended the new policy will benefit federal
employees as well as the agencies they work for.
   ``By permitting agencies to use temporaries ... we make it far
easier for managers to say `yes' to employees who need time off for
family responsibilities,'' she said. ``And by allowing agencies to
use temporary help services, we ensure that managers can get the
replacement help they need when they need it.''
   Government employee unions immediately attacked the proposal,
calling it the administration's latest attempt to contract out work
now performed by their civil service members.
   Robert Tobias, president of the National Treasury Employees
Union, said the government would pay ``significantly more'' by
contracting with suppliers of temporary workers than if it hired
more temporary workers directly by offering them higher pay.
   Tobias said a beginning clerk-typist under civil service is now
paid between $13,500 and $15,000 a year, or $6 to $7 an hour.
   ``In the Washington area, temporary help suppliers are charging
anywhere from $12 to $15 an hour for a person,'' he said. ``It
would be a lot cheaper if they cut out the middleman and offered to
increase the pay by 20 percent.''
   Under the new regulations, an agency could use temporary help
services only in cases in which a regular federal employee is
absent because of emergency, accident, maternity leave or illness,
or to fill a short-term gap when a worker is transferred or their
job is being contracted out.
   But temporary help services also could be relied upon if the
work ``is in a shortage occupation which the agency is aggressively
seeking to fill permanently.''
   James Lafferty, an OPM spokesman, said the government is facing
large shortages of clerical workers and secretaries in high-cost
cities where unemployment rates are low. Specifically, he cited
Washington, New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago and San
Francisco.
   Red Evans, a spokesman for the National Federation of Federal
Employees, called the second provision a ``loophole'' that would
allow widescale use of temporary workers and substantial abuses to
the detriment of a permanent civil service.
   ``It's a copout as far as we're concerned,'' he said. ``They're
having a hard time filling these jobs because they don't pay
enough.''
   Some agencies already have latitude to use temporary help
agencies in special circumstances. For example, the U.S. Forest
Service has been utilizing them since the end of World War II to
supplement their crews during peak fire seasons.
   The new policy would limit the use of any one employee from a
temporary help service to 45 working days during a six-month
period. Temporaries also could not be used more than 90 working
days a year for a particular position or to displace any current
federal employee.

<HEAD>Economic Gaps Widens Between Black And White Families</HEAD>

   Increases in poverty rates and income
stagnation among blacks have helped push the economic gap between
black and white families below figures from the late 1970s and
1960s, a private research organization said Monday.
   A study by the liberal-oriented Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities concluded that both black married and single-parent
families lost economic ground behind white families during the last
decade.
   ``In 1987, the income of the typical black family _ at $18,098 _
equaled just 56.1 percent of the typical white family's income
($32,274), a lower percentage than any year in the late 1970s or
late 1960s (59.2 percent),'' center Director Robert Greenstein said
in a statement.
   Median family income for black families decreased by $854
between 1978 and 1987, while the median income for white families
increased $276, the study said.
   Greenstein said the center, which studies government spending
and public policy issues as they affect low- and moderate-income
Americans, used 1978 as a comparison year because economic
conditions, such as overall unemployment rates (6.2 percent in
1978), were similar to those of 1987 (6.1 percent).
   ``Black unemployment has dropped significantly in recent years,
but this has not been matched by comparable increases in black
family income and declines in black poverty,'' he said.
   ``The evidence indicates that declines in wages for black
workers, compared to the 1970s, and budget cuts at both federal and
state levels in programs for low-income families have contributed
to black economic slippage,'' Greenstein said.
   The study said that, after adjusting for inflation, the typical
black full-time black worker earned $315 a week in 1987 _ figure
lower than that in any year in the 1970s when the wages ranged from
$340 to $330. This is compared to the 1987 salary given to their
white counterparts, whose salary ranged hovered around $420
throughout the 1970s.
   Regionally, income disparities between black and white families
have increased since the late 1970s everywhere except in the West,
the study said. The gap widened most in the Midwest, where typical
black family income was nearly $4,700 lower in 1987 than in the
late 1970s, while the income of the typical white family was only
$700 below the late-1970s figures.
   The most recent figures, for 1987, indicate that black median
family income was 63.4 percent of white income in the West, 58.6
percent in the Northeast, 56.3 percent in the South and 52.1
percent in the Midwest.
   The study noted the growing income disparity between blacks and
whites is a result of the growing income gap between upper- and
lower-income families in the nation as a whole.
   ``In 1987, the gap reached its widest point in 40 years,'' it
said, as ``the poorest two-fifths of American families received
15.4 percent of the national family income in both 1986 and 1987,
their lowest share since the Census Bureau first collected data in
1947.''
   Conversely, the richest one-fifth of all families received 43.7
percent of the national family income in 1986 and 1987, the highest
percentage on record, it said.
   Other findings included:
   _Poverty rates for both blacks and whites climbed above levels
in the 1970s, with 2 million more blacks and 8 million more
Americans overall living in poverty in 1987 than in 1978.
   _Despite a fifth year of economic recovery, the black poverty
rate rose from 31.1 percent in 1986 to 33.1 percent in 1987, while
the white poverty rate declined from 11 percent to 10.5 percent.
   _Budget reductions in programs for low-income households has
disproportionately affected blacks, who are three times more likely
than whites to be poor.

<NOTE>EDs: New lead to UPDATE with press secretary and ethics office
agreeing that no apparel transactions needed to be reported;
INSERTS grafs 5-7, ``Mrs. Reagan'' to show first lady's regrets,

   First Lady Nancy Reagan expressed regret
Monday that she failed to heed the advice of White House lawyers
that she formally disclose her borrowing of gowns and other
designer apparel. But her press secretary and a government ethics
spokesman said there was no legal requirement that she do so.
   Press Secetary Elaine Crispen acknowledged that Mrs. Reagan had
reported such loans when the issue first arose in November 1981,
saying the first lady then decided ``to err on the side'' of
compliance with the law.
   Since 1982, Mrs. Reagan has continued to borrow and return items
without reporting the transactions, Mrs. Crispen said, even though
White House lawyers originally had recommended disclosure as a
precautionary measure.
   ``Mrs. Reagan regrets that she failed to heed counsel's
advice,'' Mrs. Crispen said in a formal statement late Monday.
``Nevetheless, no reporting rules or laws were violated.''
   A spokesman for the Office of Government Ethics confirmed that
the office had supported a conclusion of then-White House Counsel
Fred Fielding in 1982 that such reporting was not required under
the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.
   ``The apparel Mrs. Reagan received was either paid for, given to
her personally as gifts by old friends and not subject to
reporting, or loaned to her and returned. All reporting
requirements were met,'' the statement released by Mrs. Crispen
said.
   Donald Campbell, a spokesman for the ethics office, said
officials there agreed with Fielding's contention that no reporting
was required under the act _ and said that Mrs. Reagan has been
operating under that guidance since that time.
   Campbell said officials in the federal ethics office had
received a letter from Fielding in which ``he laid out the fact
that the first lady had borrowed certain gowns for certain events
and, in his opinion, that was not something that needed to be
reported.''
   Campbell said that J. Jackson Walters, then the director of the
federal ethics office, agreed with Fielding's conclusion.
   But he also said in a telephone interview that ``since the
question has been raised, we will look at it again, to see if we
made the right decision.''
   Mrs. Reagan is not considered an official or employee of the
U.S. government, and is therefore not required to file her own
disclosure form _ as the president must do on an annual basis. She
did make the initial disclosures of clothes transactions on her
husband's disclosure form covering 1981 in what Campbell described
as ``an abundance of caution.''
   The issue was raised anew by the current issue of Time magazine.
It said that Mrs. Reagan has continued to accept and to wear
expensive evening gowns and other outfits, furnished by leading
couturiers such as James Galanos and David Hayes, without reporting
the practice.
   ``There are no taxpayers' dollars that go toward the first
lady's wardrobe whatsoever,'' Mrs. Crispen said in a telephone
interview. The spokeswoman said she thought the story was unmerited.
   ``I think she (Mrs. Reagan) has made Americans so proud'' of the
way she has represented them at official events, the press
secretary said. ``For any first lady, there have been mounds of
things that you have to go to, and you have to borrow, and it's not
illegal.''
   Mrs. Crispen said ``there have been things that have been
borrowed since 1982 _ and they were returned.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater described Reagan as
``upset over these attacks'' on the first lady. He said that no
internal review had been commenced in the wake of the Time report,
saying ``I don't know that there needs to be one.''
   The Time magazine article included pictures of Mrs. Reagan
posing with, among others, French President Francois Mitterrand and
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and wearing expensive
gowns. The article said she borrowed gowns ranging in value to as
high as $22,000 for one such outfit.
   Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman denied that the first lady had kept
any of the numerous dresses and outfits loaned to her by designers.
   ``To a typical woman, there are some gowns that are so
spectacular that you would only wear it once,'' she said.
   Los Angeles designer David Hayes said Mrs. Reagan has borrowed
60 to 80 made-to-order outfits during the past eight years. She
returned more than half and kept the others, he was quoted as
saying in the Time article.
   ``We think of it as loans. It's wonderful,'' Hayes said. ``She
has been a sensation for my business.''
   An unidentified executive at Harry Winston jewelers in New York
City told Time that Mrs. Reagan continued to borrow expensive
accessories, including a pair of diamond earrings worth $800,000.
   Mrs. Crispen said the first lady on two occasions borrowed
jewelry from Harry Winston jewelers _ for the 1981 presidential
inaugural and for the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana
later that year. But the spokeswoman placed no value on the
merchandise.
   Chris Blazakis, who worked with designer Galanos and is writing
a book about the Reagans, said he has identified more than 300
photographs since 1982 showing Mrs. Reagan wearing outfits he
estimates are worth a total of more than $1 million retail.
   Reagan's presidential salary is $200,000 a year, and his 1987
tax form disclosed modest income that Mrs. Reagan had received in
talent fees and residuals from appearances on network television
shows, but no information about her clothing.

<HEAD>Group Seeks Apology For Female Reporter Denied Access To Athletes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vanderbilt University's athletic director
should apologize to a female reporter who was denied access to
athletes after a football game, the American Society of Newspaper
Editors said Monday.
   In a letter to university Chancellor Joe B. Wyatt, the newspaper
group said reporter Karen Rosen, of the Atlanta Journal and
Constitution, had asked to interview two football players who were
available to male reporters in the locker room after the
Vanderbilt-Georgia game on Oct. 8.
   The request was ``either not relayed or ignored,'' said Jean H.
Otto, chairman of the ASNE Press, Bar and Public Affairs Committee,
noting that Ms. Rosen had not asked to enter the locker room.
   ``For any reporter to be denied reasonable access to events or
people who are available to other reporters is unacceptable in that
it limits access by the public,'' Otto said in the letter.
   Otto noted that Wyatt had apologized for the incident and had
promised it would not happen again. But the ASNE official said
Athletic Director Roy Kramer had not apologized, adding, ``Until
that is forthcoming, this incident cannot be considered closed.''
   ASNE asked Wyatt to seek an apology for Ms. Rosen from Kramer
and any other university official involved in the incident, and to
devise a rule to guarantee equal access to all reporters covering
sports in the future.

   A foot-long crack and 29 smaller cracks were
discovered by chance on a Continental Airlines Boeing 737 recently
in roughly the same area where a similar Aloha Airlines jet broke
apart in flight last April, officials said Monday.
   Metallurgists from the National Transportation Safety Board were
examining the 30-inch section of the aircraft where the cracks were
found along a ``lap joint,'' or section where the outer metal skin
overlaps, near a window of the first-class section.
   NTSB Chairman James Kolstad said the ``chilling discovery'' was
made by Continental workers Oct. 5 when they began stripping paint
from the 19-year-old Boeing 737 to prepare it for repainting.
   Kolstad in a speech delivered to an aviation group in Montreal
called the discovery ``frightening'' in part because the cracks
were found by chance and because they were ``in the same general
area'' where the Aloha plane broke apart.
   But Federal Aviation Administration officials cautioned against
comparing the Aloha incident and the cracks found on the
Continental plane.
   One FAA official, speaking on condition he not be further
identified, said the cracks on the Continental jet were found at a
point lower on the aircraft near a window and where there
apparently had been repair work performed by a previous owner of
the plane.
   The Aloha incident, which remains under investigation by the
NTSB, is widely believed to involved cracking caused by corrosion,
but corrosion does not appear to have been a factor in the cracks
on the Continental aircraft, this official suggested.
   An FAA spokesman, Bob Buckhorn, said the agency expects to issue
a new directive soon to airlines broadening the inspection
requirements on older Boeing 737s in search of cracks including
increased use of testing by high-frequency electronic equipment.
The new rule also will require that the planes be stripped of paint
when being inspected, he said.
   A spokesman for Continental said the airline inspected all 42 of
its older Boeing 737s within 72 hours after the foot-long crack was
discovered when the plane was being prepared for repainting at the
airline's Los Angeles repair facility.
   He said no cracks were found in any of the other planes.
   ``This appears to be an isolated incident,'' said Continental
spokesman Ned Walker in Houston.
   Walker said the plane, which was built in 1969, had undergone a
visual inspection for cracks last May 20 in accordance with a
directive from the FAA and no cracks were found then.
   According to the safety board, the Continental plane had about
55,446 takeoffs and landings. This was considerably fewer than the
89,000 cycles attributed to the Aloha Boeing 737 involved in last
April's incident in which a 20-foot section of the plane's roof
ripped away during flight.
   A flight attendant was swept to her death, but the plane
miraculously landed safely with passengers and flight attendants
clinging to their seats to keep from being sucked through the
gaping hole.
   The Aloha 737 was the 152nd off the Boeing assembly line, while
the Continental jet was No. 17O. Both were built in 1969 and were
among the 291 737s on which a so-called ``cold bonding'' process
was used to fix sections of metal sheets onto the fuselage.
   Shortly after the Aloha incident, the FAA required airlines to
conduct special inspections of more than 200 older 737s. Those
aircraft with more than 30,000 takeoffs and landings were required
to be visually inspected for cracks, while those with more than
50,000 takeoffs and landings were to undergo inspections with
high-frequency electronic equipment.
   The so-called ``eddy current'' tests are designed to uncover
extremely tiny cracks that might be overlooked in a visual
inspection.
   Although the Continental plane where the foot-long crack was
found Oct. 5 had more than 50,000 cycles the eddy current
inspection was not required on the section of the aircraft where
the crack later was discovered, Walker said. He said a visual
inspection of that section of the plane showed no cracking last May.
   The Boeing 737 is widely used for short-haul flights. According
to the Boeing Co., 212 older Boeing 737s operated by 19 U.S.
airlines in domestic service were subject to the special FAA
inspection requirements last May.
   Boeing spokesman David Jimenez said in Seattle the company was
referring any questions to Continental regarding the discovery of
cracks.

   Severe thunderstorms raked Missouri and Illinois with hail and
strong winds Monday, cloudy skies prevailed in the Northeast and
sunny skies warmed the southern and far western portions of the
nation.
   Two schools and a factory near Peoria, Ill., were evacuated as
the storm battered the area, downing trees and power lines. No
injuries were reported.
   In the central Illinois community of Colfax, hail the size of
golfballs fell during the thunderstorm. The storms produced large
hail and damaging winds in Woodford County. The St. Louis area had
small hail and strong winds.
   Over an inch of rain fell at O'Hare International Airport in
Chicago.
   The thunderstorms developed near a warm front in an area of
abundant low-level moisture and strong winds in the upper
atmosphere.
   Rain also fell Monday in Minnesota, Wyoming, Nebraska, northern
Idaho and over the northern Rockies.
   Rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included 0.63
inches in St. Louis; 0.41 inches in Houlton, Maine; and 0.35 inches
at O'Hare.
   Afternoon temperatures Monday were in the 70s and 80s from the
south Atlantic and Gulf coastal states to the southern Plains and
as far north as Missouri and southern Kansas. Temperatures reached
the 90s in parts of Texas.
   San Francisco had 92 degrees, and Redding, Calif., had 94, both
records for the date.
   Temperatures were in the 40s and 50s from Michigan across the
upper Mississippi Valley and northern Plains into the northern
Rockies.
   Record high temperatures were recorded in Lubbock, Texas, 92;
Roswell, N.M., 90; and Wichita, Kan., 87.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 42
degrees at Duluth, Minn., and Hibbing, Minn., to 98 degress at Palm
Springs, Calif. The nation's low Monday morning was 17 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Tuesday called for showers and thunderstorms
from New England to the Ohio Valley and mid Atlantic coastal
states. Some rain was expected to develop along the Washington and
Oregon coasts.
   High temperatures were expected in the 80s from the south
Atlantic and Gulf coastal states across the lower Mississippi
Valley to Texas, with a few readings near 90 degrees in Texas.
Temperatures were predicted in the 80s and 90s over the desert
Southwest and interior valleys of California. High temperatures
were to be in the 50s from Washington state across Montana, the
Dakotas and the upper Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes region
with some 40s over northern Michigan and northern Minnesota.
Afternoon highs were to be in the 60s and 70s elsewhere across the
nation.

<HEAD>Bakkers' Attorney Says Salaries and Benefits Were Legal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TRIP DuBARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The salaries and benefits given PTL
founders Jim and Tammy Bakker were properly approved and legal, the
Bakkers' lawyer told a judge Monday in the trial of PTL's $52
million lawsuit against the couple and a former aide.
   In his opening statement, Ryan Hovis said the case against the
Bakkers boiled down to allegations they mismanaged the ministry,
which went into bankruptcy three months after Bakker resigned in a
sex-and-hush money scandal.
   Hovis said he would show that the Bakkers' salaries were
authorized by the ministry's board, the benefits they enjoyed were
properly donated by the ministry and the cash advances they
received were reimbursed.
   But because the ministry's records are now dispersed among other
legal actions, including bankruptcy court, Hovis said he may be
unable to provide precise documentation.
   ``A lot of the records are simply not available,'' he told U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds.
   Instead, Hovis said, he would show a ``pattern of
reimbursement'' and prior approval.
   Hovis' comments marked the start of the second half of testimony
in the lawsuit against the Bakkers and former aide David Taggart.
   Last month, PTL attorneys Tom White and Brad Leggett entered
into evidence financial records from Bakker's time as leader of PTL
and brought in PTL officials and an Internal Revenue Service agent
to testify on behalf of its claims of mismanagement.
   Among the items admitted as evidence were receipts for
extravagant purchases by the Bakkers, including installing a water
slide at their lakefront home.
   PTL also presented IRS documents that the Bakkers and Taggart
received compensation and bonuses far in excess of accepted IRS
guidelines.
   On Monday, Herbert Moore, who said he has done financial
consulting work for hundreds of churches including PTL, testified
that standard financial procedures for businesses were not the norm
for churches, which found needs first and then sought the revenues
to pay for them.
   ``Is it fair to say that financial matters of the church are
dealt with on faith?'' Hovis asked.
   ``Yes,'' Moore replied.
   PTL sought protection in June 1987 under Chapter 11 of the
bankruptcy code, which shields an operation from creditors while it
reorganizes.
   On Monday, Reynolds, who is overseeing the bankruptcy case, said
he wants to see how the proposed sale of the ministry's Heritage
USA complex shapes up before considering whether to liquidate PTL's
assets.
   Reynolds postponed until Nov. 16 consideration of several
motions by creditors to move the ministry from Chapter 11 to
Chapter 7. If granted, it would mean the Heritage USA Christian
entertainment park and other ministry assets such as satellite
television facilities, a hotel and real estate would be sold by an
immediate auction rather than by an arranged sale.
   Canadian businessman Stephen Mernick has signed a contract with
PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton to buy Heritage USA for
$115 million, and Nov. 16 is the date Benton is to present the
proposed sale to the court.
   ``As you'll observe, I'm stacking everything up to the 16th, to
see what washes out by then,'' Reynolds said.
   Meanwhile, Benton said the ministry's payroll has continued to
shrink, with about 150 people laid off since Labor Day, including
about 100 seasonal and temporary employees.
   The trustee said the ministry's labor force was down to about
400 people evenly divided between the for-profit debtor corporation
holding the ministry's assets, and the non-profit ministry.
   The ministry had about 1,480 full-time employees at the time it
filed for bankruptcy protection.

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers complained Monday that the
Philippines settled for too little in a pact on U.S. military bases
and warned the terms could boost those who want the facilities
closed when the lease expires.
   President Corazon Aquino urged the public to wait for more
details before judging the new agreement, which was signed Monday
afternoon in Washington by Secretary of State George Shultz and the
Philippines' Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus.
   The pact sets the terms for the remaining two years of the U.S.
lease on the bases, which expires in 1991. Under the terms, the
Philippines will get $962 million in U.S. aid in exchange for use
of the bases.
   The negotiations were technically a review of an existing bases
agreement that the Aquino government never hinted at canceling. But
tension between the United States and its former colony were high
because of bargaining over the aid package as well as nuclear and
other issues.
   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile said Monday the upper chamber
should have the chance to ratify the agreement as if it were a
treaty because ``there are rights and obligations growing from it.''
   He cited a constitutional provision which says no treaty or
international agreement shall be valid without the concurrence of
two-thirds of the Senate. The Aquino administration has not
indicated that the agreement needs Senate approval.
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, chairman of the Senate Defense Committee,
said the accord showed that ``it seems this administration is not
ready yet to stand up to Washington.
   ``A publicly unacceptable compensation package certainly
strengthens the hands of those who are batting for no extension (of
the bases lease) after 1991,'' Maceda said.
   Philippine sources have said that Manglapus, head of the
Philippine negotiating panel, originally asked for $1.2 billion a
year for use of the two largest U.S. bases abroad _ the Clark Air
Base and the Subic Navy Base _ and four smaller installations.
   Mrs. Aquino refused to comment on the agreement, saying only:
``Why don't we just wait until all the details are laid out and
expressed by Secretary Manglapus.''
   She has not said whether she will support extending the
agreement after 1991, one year before her term ends. The
Constitution requires that any extension be approved by two-thirds
of the 23-member Senate, where anti-bases sentiment is strong.
   Rep. Gualberto Lumauig of the lower chamber's Foreign Relations
Committee, termed the agreement ``welcome news'' because it would
mean more money for the country's debt-strapped economy.
   The agreement represents an increase of $258 million in economic
and military aid as part of a complicated arrangement that permits
the Philippines to use a ``substantial portion'' to reduce its debt
and bars American soldiers who test positive for AIDS from serving
in the country.
   But Sen. Wigberto Tanada, a leading opponent of the bases and
chief sponsor of the senate's anti-nuclear weapons bill, said
financial compensation was not the only issue.
   ``I don't think it is enough to settle the issue of compensation
if the threat of national destruction due to nuclear weapons and
the derogation of national sovereignty is still there,'' he said.
   Left-wing groups pressing for the dismantling of U.S. facilities
branded the agreement a ``sell-out'' and said Manglapus should not
have linked continued U.S. presence here to the debt issue.

   The Communist Party chief urged
Yugoslavia on Monday to unite behind reform or face destruction,
but a defiant Serbian leader defended the mass rallies that are
fueling ethnic unrest.
   Worker dissatisfaction over the economy together with ethnic
discontent have stirred speculation recently about a possible
military takeover or an eventual break-up of the six republics and
two autonomous provinces that make up Yugoslavia.
   Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Veljko Kadijevic said, however, it was
``false and malicious'' to suggest the army ``should take power
through a putsch.''
   The crisis is Yugoslavia's gravest since World War II.
   A key meeting of the Communist Party's policy-setting Central
Committee opened Monday with party chief Stipe Suvar urging
quarreling leaders to unite behind reform.
   ``All of us in this country are faced with a choice _ either we
all resolve the crisis together, or we all head to destruction,''
Suvar warned in a two-hour speech.
   But Serbian party chief Slobodan Milosevic, hailed by supporters
as ``the second Tito,'' a reference to Yugoslavia's longtime late
leader, responded with a stinging attack on past inability to
control the country's worst postwar economic and social crises.
   Yugoslavs will not accept another ``marathon, sclerotic
session'' that does nothing to ease ethnic tension and economic
hardship, Milosevic told the closed-door session in a speech later
broadcast on national radio and television.
   Workers battling a 217 percent inflation rate and austerity
measures imposed to curb a $21 billion foreign debt have
increasingly blamed Communist leaders for their plight, and have
protested on the streets.
   Milosevic defended his drive to extend Serbian control over its
two autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, where the Serb
minority alleges harassment at the hands of the ethnic Albanian
majority.
   Hundreds of thousands of Serbs have been rallying to back
Milosevic's demands, causing unprecedented rifts with communist
leaders of Yugoslavia's five other republics.
   Suvar demanded an end to ``reckless confrontations'' and said
the mass rallies ``are leading us nowhere.''
   But Milosevic said: ``Any banning of the meetings is
unacceptable,'' and said claims that the rallies fuel unrest are
``sad and shameful.''
   The non-Serbs fear Milosevic seeks to boost his national power
and that of Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic.
   Milosevic assured them, ``Serbia has no claims to the territory
of other republics. It does have claim to territory in its own
republic.''
   Vojvodina and Kosovo are historically part of Serbia.
   His speech indicated that rifts that opened up in clashes last
week with Suvar and party chief Milan Kucan of liberal, northern
Slovenia still divide Yugoslavia's three most important Communist
leaders.
   Suvar, a Croat, advocated ``a fundamental renewal of socialism''
and urgent economic and political reforms to solve mounting foreign
debt and stagnation.
   Kucan later expressed unreserved support for Suvar's speech.
   Milosevic made plain he wants the problem of control over Kosovo
sorted out before economic reform goes ahead.
   The meeting was billed as a historic gathering to shake up the
party leadership.
   ``All the incompetent and compromised people must go, and this
society must be ensured of a perspective,'' Suvar said Monday.
   But no immediate word surfaced on any sweeping personnel changes.
   Azem Vlasi, the top ethnic Albanian leader from Kosovo, rejected
Serbian calls to step down.
   To date, four members of the 23-man Politburo have said they
will resign. Their resignations are expected to be formally
accepted by the 162-member Central Committee on Tuesday.
   Suvar said last week up to one-third of the Central Committee
could be replaced.
   Few leaders who spoke Monday offered any new suggestions to
solve Yugoslavia's woes.
   Kucan however advanced the novel idea of a referendum to test
the party's popularity in Slovenia and denied that the republic's
liberal leadership has no popular support.
   The party chief of the republic of Montenegro, Marko Orlandic,
attacked the federal government of Premier Branko Mikulic and
blamed it for for failing to solve the economic crisis.
   Suvar advocated expanded private ownership, increased foreign
investment and the shutdown of unprofitable state enterprises. He
said key managerial positions limited to communists might be opened
to non-party members.
   Suvar also said a new constitution might be drafted and
discussed at the next national party congress in 1990.
   The constitution, adopted in 1974 under Josip Broz Tito, created
a loose confederation. Many see it as a main cause of the problems
now because it leaves central power weak.

<HEAD>U.N. Officials Say U.S. Still Will Withhold Some Dues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The United States will continue
withholding some of its dues to the United Nations despite
President Reagan's pledge last month that they would be paid, U.N.
officials said Monday.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Washington would retain $59 million in dues to force the United
Nations to adopt an austerity budget.
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the withholding of funds will
endanger U.N. peacekeeping projects, such as military observers in
Iran and Iraq and possible future missions to South-West Africa and
other areas.
   Reagan told the General Assembly on Sept. 13 that he would
release the $188 million in dues owed for last year and this year
and added he was satisfied with the organization's progress on
budgetary and administrative reforms.
   The $188 million is $44 million from the previous fiscal year
and $144 million for the current fiscal year.
   Washington paid $15 million in September and on Friday it gave
the United Nations $85.6 million.
   That still leaves more than $$87 million from the $188 million
owed. Reagan had said the full amount would be paid by the end of
the year.
   But the U.N. officials said Washington informed U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that $59 million would be
frozen until the General Assembly's main financial committee, the
Fifth Committee, adopts an austerity budget recommended last month
by a subcommittee.
   Even if the United States pays all $188 million it will still
owe millions more to the world organization in funds withheld
during earlier years.
   Friday's payment reduced the U.S. arrears to the regular budget
to $366.3 million. And U.N. officials estimate America owes about
$300 million more for unpaid assessments for other projects
including peacekeeping forces and payments to U.N. special agencies.
   Reagan last month pledged a ``multi-year'' payment plan for all
the back dues. U.N. Undersecretary-General Joseph V. Reed has said
the State Department told him the payments would be on a
three-to-five-year plan.
   Since Reagan took office nearly eight years ago his
administration has harshly criticized the United Nation, accusing
it of having an anti-Western bias and of bureaucracy and waste.
   The United States is assessed one-fourth of the U.N.'s regular
budget, and was supposed to pay $212 million this fiscal year but
Congress only appropriated $144 million.
   U.N. officials have said that continued withholding of funds
could force the world body to close in November.
   The United Nations has no reserve funds and operates by spending
dues it collects almost as soon as it receives them.
   Eckhard said so far the United Nations has collected only a
fraction of the $35.7 million it assessed its members for the first
three month of operations of the Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group.

   NASA officials are discussing possibly installing
U.S. scientific instruments on a Soviet spacecraft as part of a
joint superpower project to monitor damage to the Earth's ozone
layer, Tass said Monday.
   The Soviet news agency quoted the head of a Soviet delegation to
recent superpower talks on space, Albert Chernikov, as saying the
discussions in Moscow dealt with the launching of a U.S.-made
spectrometer on the Soviet Meteor-3 satellite in 1990-91.
   In Washington, Charles Redmond, a spokesman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, confirmed on Monday that a
NASA official is now in the Soviet Union for discussions on placing
a spectrometer on a Soviet satellite to monitor the ozone layer.
   U.S. equipment has been used aboard a Soviet spacecraft in the
past, but Redmond said this venture would be the first in which the
United States would actually supervise its own equipment by working
with the Soviets.
   Tass said the goal of the joint program was to measure the
Earth's ozone layer from space and calculate regional ozone
depletion, especially over Antarctica.
   ``The program has been worked out in accordance with the
agreement, reached at the Soviet-U.S. summit in 1988, on expanding
cooperation within the framework of the Soviet-American agreement
on space exploration,'' Tass quoted Chernikov as saying.
   He said the project also would help implement the goals of the
international Vienna convention for protection of the ozone layer.
   The next meeting of Soviet and American specialists is scheduled
for January in the United States, Tass said.

<HEAD>Lawyers React Cautiously To Proposed Changes In Libel Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libel lawyers reacted cautiously Monday to a
proposal for sweeping changes in libel law, predicting it could
lead to many frivolous suits and saying they doubted such a plan
would be politically appealing.
   The proposal is designed to resolve disputes quickly with a
focus on deciding the truth of disputed statements, rather than on
the awarding of damages. The centerpiece of the proposal is the
``no fault'' trial where no damages would be awarded, only court
fees paid by the loser.
   While the media would get relief from the prospect of huge
damage awards, they also would give up protections that have
restricted libel rulings.
   Although many libel lawyers and media representatives were
reluctant to embrace the proposal in its entirety, they said they
were encouraged that a panel of 11 lawyers, judges, journalists and
others of diverse backgrounds and philosophies could find consensus
on the thorny issue of libel.
   ``There are a lot of aspects the media side would find
favorable, and I'm impressed that they could bring together both
sides and get them to agree'' on a package of proposed reforms,
said Henry R. Kaufman, a New York libel lawyer who also is general
counsel of the Libel Research Defense Center.
   ``But this doesn't break totally new ground. Some of these
proposals have been aired before ... and we know what the reactions
are likely to be,'' he said. ``On both sides there would be some
serious reservations.''
   The study panel was put together by the Annenberg Washington
Program of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.
   The panel's proposal breaks libel action into three stages. In
the first, the emphasis is on retraction and replies. If a
newspaper or broadcast station agrees to print or air a retraction
or a reply by the person complaining about news coverage of them,
then the case is settled and a lawsuit cannot be filed.
   If there is no retraction or reply, either side can demand that
a lawsuit be tried for ``declaratory judgment,'' with the loser
paying the legal costs of the winner. Such trials would have to
begin within 120 days. The only issue would be the truth _
regardless of intent or negligence _ and no damages would be
awarded.
   If neither side wants a declaratory judgment, then a lawsuit for
libel would proceed along a path similar to the current one, except
that damages would be limited to the plaintiff's actual loss _
punitive damages would not be awarded. Also, no one could sue over
statements of opinion, such as an editorial cartoon. Only facts
would be considered, and at this stage, each side would have to pay
their own legal fees.
   Kaufman said the Libel Research Defense Center, which represents
the media in libel cases, does not take positions on such matters.
But, speaking as a libel lawyer, he said neither libel plaintiffs
nor the media are likely to work aggressively to push such a
proposal through.
   ``I have no reason to think plaintiffs' lawyers would be
supportive of something that removes from them the possibility of a
pot of gold at the end of the libel rainbow,'' he said.
   The media's reluctance revolves around the proposed change that
would eliminate the requirement that public figures suing for libel
prove that defamatory statements about them were published with
``actual malice,'' meaning with the knowledge that they were false,
or with ``reckless disregard'' of whether they were false.
   ``If I were a publisher, I wouldn't willingly trade
constitutional protections for the illusion of some kind of an
expedited low-cost, dispute-resolution process,'' said libel lawyer
Richard N. Winfield with the firm Rogers & Wells. ``I wouldn't give
up constitutional protections lightly.''
   The American Newspaper Publishers Association declined to
embrace the proposal, but said ``It deserves careful review.''
   In a statement, ANPA President Jerry W. Friedheim said, ``The
search for the best way to resolve disputes between the news media
and people who believe they have been wronged in news coverage is
well worth continuing.''
   Attorney Floyd Abrams, a noted constitutional lawyer, said that
while he would like to see libel reforms, any proposal as sweeping
as the Annenberg one should be tested in a small area before it is
put into practice on a large scale.
   ``The main danger of the proposal is that it could lead to an
explosion of new libel litigation in which people seek declarations
that something that was said about them was not true,'' he said.
   Abrams also was skeptical about the chances for getting such a
proposal implemented.
   ``I think it will probably take some new disastrous libel case
before we have any major structural change, some enormous verdict
in some highly publicized case,'' he said.

<HEAD>Newspaper Group Protests South African Warning Against Newspaper</HEAD>

   The American Society of Newspaper Editors on
Monday criticized the South African government for ``consistent and
arbitrary'' censorship of the press in that country.
   The ASNE, in a letter to South African President P.W. Botha,
expressed ``urgent concern'' over a warning issued to the Weekly
Mail by Stoffel Botha, minister of Home Affairs and Communications.
   The action ``reinforces the fear we expressed in our last
communication that it is the intention of the government to
cripple, one by one, any inconvenient publication,'' Bill Kovach,
chairman of the ASNE International Communication Committee, said in
the letter.
   ``Censorship for whatever reason is repugnant to any people, but
it is especially so to those who profess to have some voice in
governing themselves,'' said Kovach, editor of the Atlanta Journal
and Constitution.
   ``At this most critical time in the spread of the notion of a
free press in the world it is especially deplorable that the
government of South Africa chooses to continue its course down the
road of darkness and fear,'' Kovach wrote.
   He urged the South African government not to take further steps
against the Weekly Mail and to restore the right to publish to
other publications that have been shut down.

   The pilot of a Uganda Airlines jet tried three times
to land in thick fog at Rome's main airport before the Boeing 707
crashed into houses and trees early Monday, killing 31 of the 52
people aboard, authorities reported.
   The fog, a possible ``misunderstanding'' between pilot and
control tower at Leonardo da Vinci Airport, and lack of
sophisticated equipment on a seldom-used runway were cited as
suspected factors in the crash.
   All 21 survivors were hospitalized, many in critical condition
with burns, fractures and shock. Only one of seven crew members, a
steward, survived.
   Wreckage was strewn for half a mile, but only one injury was
reported on the ground.
   Rome police headquarters spokesman Paolo Moscarelli said late
Monday that one passenger died in a hospital, raising the death
toll to 31.
   Among survivors was British dairy farmer Geoffrey Gait, who said
he and his wife Ruth, who was holding their 8-month-old son, jumped
from the wreckage right before it went up in flames. The family
suffered slight burns.
   The jet missed the runway by several hundred yards. It tore
through a wooden house, clipped a garage, demolished a brick house
under construction and plowed through the parking lot of a car
rental agency, where an engine and a wing tore off and a fire
destroyed 75 cars, according to authorities.
   An occupant of the wooden house, Carlo Satta, 30, was hit on the
nose by a beam as he slept in bed in Fiumicino, 21 miles southwest
of Rome.
   Flight No. 775 began at London's Gatwick Airport late Sunday and
was bound for Entebbe, Uganda, with a one-hour stopover scheduled
in Rome.
   Most of those aboard were Ugandans. The British Embassy in Rome
said the passenger list included seven or eight British citizens.
Two Nigerians were listed among the injured.
   Airport authorities said Monday evening they did not have a list
of the dead by name and nationality.
   Alberto Di Giulio, head of the National Flight Safety Office,
said the jet tried to land three times at the seaside airport
before it crashed.
   Passenger John Harigye, a former Ugandan ambassador to the
Vatican, told reporters from his hospital bed that a flight
attendant told him just before the crash that the plane tried once
to land, had to circle because of the fog, and was about to try
another landing.
   He said that next came a violent collision and he found himself
upside down in his seat, held by his seatbelt.
   ``I realized one side of the plane was gone. I pushed through a
hole,'' helping a family friend seated near him to leave the plane,
he said.
   Outside the jet, ``I saw a woman who was calling me. She knew
me. I told her to move away,'' then the plane exploded, said
Harigye, whose hand bandage was soaked with blood. The fuel
apparently ignited after the crash.
   Guido Chiucini, commander of Rome Province's fire department,
speculated in a telephone interview that a ``misunderstanding'' may
have developed between the control tower and the pilot since the
landing was begun at a very low altitude.
   Chiucini, who helped coordinate the rescue, did not elaborate.
   Later the air traffic controllers' union denied there was a
misunderstanding.
   Asked about Chiucini's remarks, Di Giulio said the tapes of
cockpit conversation had yet to be reviewed.
   Since Sunday evening, a heavy fog had enveloped the Rome
seacoast including the airport.
   ``The fog appears to have been the main culprit,'' Di Giulio
said.
   Without citing its sources, RAI state television said the pilot
began the third attempt too low. Italy's ANSA news agency said the
pilot had approached from three different directions because of
shifting fog banks.
   Andrea Gariup, of Italy's main pilots' union, was quoted by RAI
as saying the runway on which the pilot tried to land lacked
sophisticated equipment to help in instrument landings and was not
normally used.
   Authorities reported both the flight instrument data recordings
and the recordings of conversations between cockpit and tower were
recovered.
   Gait said he was involved in a charity project to provide Uganda
farmers with cows.
   He told The Associated Press in an interview at Sant'Eugenio
Hospital that he heard the planes' wheels come up, go down and then
go up again moments before impact.
   ``The flames came through the cabin, my wife says. I don't
remember ... We jumped out of a hole in the fuselage behind us . ..
Ruth jumped backward, holding (baby Richard) to her chest and then
fell about six feet to the ground. I picked them up. We walked
about 200 yards and then some Ugandans came out.''
   The three Gaits were expected to be discharged by Wednesday.

<HEAD>Official: Passengers On More Than 120 Flights May Be Affected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bacterial illness linked to food served on
at least eight Northwest Airlines flights since Sept. 15 may
ultimately affect passengers on more than 120 Northwest flights, a
state official said Monday.
   ``We have received hundreds of calls as this has hit the
national media,'' state epidemiologist Michael Osterholm said at a
news conference. Some complaints have come from as far as Japan and
East Germany, which are on Northwest's flight routes, he said.
   Confirmed cases of the illness, shigellosis, have been found
among passengers who flew with the airline as late as Oct. 12.
Osterholm said it's not clear if food now being served on Northwest
planes is safe.
   ``I can't confirm that it is safe and I can't say it isn't,'' he
said.
   The disease causes intense diarrhea and other symptoms that can
last for five to seven days. It spreads easily from person to
person. Of people exposed to the bacteria, about 10 percent usually
get sick, Osterholm said.
   All the illnesses confirmed so far have been traced to food
prepared in Marriott Corp.'s airline kitchen at the Minneapolis-St.
Paul International Airport. The facility serves 100,000 meals a
week for Northwest.
   The investigation began after 21 Minnesota Vikings became ill
after eating food prepared for a flight to an Oct. 2 football game
in Miami.
   Investigators initially focused on the possibility that
ingredients in the meals may have been contaminated or that one or
more sick food preparers transmitted the bacteria, and Osterholm
say the latter now appears more likely.
   Shigellosis has been confirmed in passengers on eight flights
from the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul to Detroit; Miami;
Nashville, Tenn.; Newark, N.J.; Seattle and St. Louis. Two flight
attendants are among those confirmed as having been infected.
   Osterholm said it's probable that ``several hundred'' passengers
on more than 120 additional flights may have been affected.
   The Minnesota Health Department has set up extra telephone lines
to receive calls from people who believe they may have been
infected.
   ``We're working around the clock here _ literally,'' Osterholm
said.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, stalking Reagan
Democrats on the Texas-Arkansas border, scoffed Monday at
Republican charges that Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis favors
harsh gun controls and would weaken the military.
   ``I saw those ads about Mike Dukakis going to take the guns away
from you, confiscate the guns, not even pay for them.'' Bentsen
told 200 supporters at an airport rally during a refueling stop on
his way to California.
   ``Let me tell you, a fella like Lloyd Bentsen likes to go quail
hunting like I do,'' said the Democratic vice presidential
candidate. ``(I) sure wouldn't be running with any fella if I
thought he was going to take my shotgun away from me, no way.''
   While Dukakis does support gun control, Bentsen said, he
believes sportsmen should have guns and people have the right to
defend their homes. He said GOP nominee George Bush was ``the only
one of the four candidate who has voted for national gun control''
as a congressman in 1968.
   Bentsen said it was untrue that the Democrats wanted to cut
defense spending. He scorned Republican commercials on the defense
issue featuring former test pilot Chuck Yeager.
   The Texas senator said Yeager should return to writing books and
lobbying for a defense contractor, and stay out of politics.
   Later in California, Bentsen told a crowd of several thousand
students at the University of California at San Diego that the
Republicans were squandering America's technological future.
   In 1980, he said, 60 percent of color televisions sold in
America were made in the United States. Today, less than 10 percent
are, and the United States makes no video cassette recorders,
compact disc players or fax machines.
   He also decried what he said were Republican distortions of
Dukakis' record, invoking, as he did over the weekend, the image of
Harry Truman's come-from-behind campaign.
   ``It was Harry Truman who said that you have to appeal to the
best instincts of people, not to their worst,'' he told the crowd,
few of whom were born when Truman was in the White House.
``Sometimes you can win a few elections that way, but you really
hurt your country.''
   ``Well, some of you recall when Harry Truman ran for
re-election, he had a very arrogant opponent that knew he'd won
it,'' Bentsen said referring to Thomas E. Dewey. ``But the people
kept yelling to Harry, `Harry, give `em hell.' But Harry would say,
`I just tell the truth and the Republicans think it's hell.'
   ``Well, Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen are offering the truth,''
he said.
   Bentsen's Texarkana stopover was aimed at both East Texas and
Arkansas, which are strong in loyal Democrats but where the party
has been struggling to reverse its sagging fortunes in the
Bush-Dukakis presidential race.
   Bentsen has refused to concede Texas, although the Democratic
ticket is more than 10 points behind Bush and running mate Dan
Quayle in some polls. The contest is closer in Arkansas but the
Democrats have suffered there.
   Rep. Tommy Robinson, D-Ark., said last week that Dukakis was
``not welcome'' in his district.
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., rode to Texarkana with Bentsen on
the campaign jet and told reporters that his state was still there
for Dukakis to win if he improves his organization and his message.
   Alexander said favorite Dukakis-Bentsen topics such as world
trade are too esoteric for many Arkansas voters.
   So far, Alexander said, the Massachusetts governor has proved to
be a disappointing campaigner who is unwilling to exploit issues
where Republicans are vulnerable, such as the war on drugs.
   ``He's got to show some passion, commitment, leadership,''
Alexander said. ``He may have made an A-plus in political science,
but so far he hasn't passed politics.''
   ``He could capture the hearts and minds of the people of the
South in the next three weeks if he'd come out swinging,'' he said.
``He can do it. ... Someone's gotta get him off in the corner, grab
him and tell him what to do.''

<TEXT>
   Ralph S. Morton, a former Associated
Press war correspondent in Asia, has died at the age of 80.
   It was announced that he died Sunday at a Halifax hospital but
the cause of death was not given.
   Morton, born in Bedford, Nova Scotia, was graduated from
Dalhousie University in Halifax. He worked as a reporter at the
Halifax Herald from 1932 to 1934, when he joined The Canadian Press
and became that news agency's first Prince Edward Island
correspondent.
   He served with CP in Boston and Toronto from 1937 to 1939 and
then was managing editor of the Protestant Digest in New York.
   Morton joined the AP in 1943 and worked on the world service
desk in New York. In 1945, he became a U.S. citizen.
   He went to Asia as a war correspondent in 1945, served in the
Philippines and New Guinea and also covered the revolutionary
conflict in Indonesia.
   Morton was AP chief of bureau in Australia from 1945 to 1948,
then returned to New York. He worked on the AP foreign desk for six
years and also taught at the Columbia University school of
journalism.
   In 1954, he and his wife, journalist Ruth Macaulay, founded the
weekly Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Free Press, which they owned and
operated until Morton retired in 1968.
   Morton continued writing for publications and radio stations,
however. In 1970, he was appointed editor of Hansard, the official
record of the debates in the Nova Scotia legislature and worked
there for eight years.
   He retired again but continued to teach at the Kings College
school of journalism.
   His survivors include two daughters and five grandchildren.
   A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Wednesday in St.
Matthews United Church in Halifax.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Trade Attacks on Military, Jobs With 3 Weeks to Go</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with Dukakis comments on poll; Bush in Skokie, new
Bush ad; EDITS to tighten.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

   George Bush, signaling he won't sit on his lead in the
campaign's final weeks, returned to the attack Monday and said
Michael Dukakis should ``stop running down our defenses.'' Dukakis
charged Bush with ignoring the nation's loss of industrial jobs.
   Battling the notion that he is slipping hopelessly behind, the
Democratic presidential nominee stopped at a factory, a diner and a
bowling alley as he began a campaing swing through industrial
states. He said Bush ``sat on his hands while America's industrial
heartland has been fighting for its life.''
   Dukakis was confronted with an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll
showing Bush has opened a huge lead, 55 percent to 38 percent,
nationally since their final debate last Thursday.
   ``Well I can only tell you that there are other polls that say
very different things about where we are and where the race is,''
Dukakis told an interviewer for a Chicago television station.
   ``Now, we've got a new set of numbers that has absolutely no
relationship to anything that we have or other polls have, so you
spend two or three days'' answering answering questions about it,
he said.
   The poll was conducted Friday trough Sunday among 1,378 likely
voters, and found even half of Dukakis' own supporters expected
Bush to win.
   Dukakis' running mate Lloyd Bentsen launched an attack on Bush
in the South as ``the only one of the four candidates who has voted
for national gun control.'' He referred to a 1968 vote while Bush
was in Congress.
   With three weeks left in the presidential race, aides to Dukakis
said he would seek to sharpen the differences between himself and
the vice president, particularly on economic issues.
   But as he arrived in Ohio, a big state crucial to his chances, a
new statewide poll by the Akron Beacon Journal showed Bush holding
a double-digit lead.
   Bush, buoyant but cautioning against overconfidence, toured a
Denver-area defense plant where Star Wars research is conducted. He
then spoke at the dedication of a Holocaust memorial in Skokie,
Ill., where he said ``the relationship between Israel and the
United States has never been better.''
   He used the Denver setting to say Dukakis has a ``total lack of
understanding of our military'' and is ``trying desperately to jump
into the mainstream'' by acknowledging a need to modernize
land-based nuclear missiles.
   ``But there is strong reason to doubt that he would do it,''
Bush said. ``He still opposes the MX and he thinks the Midgetman
costs too much. So he says he's going to work with Congress to find
another way.
   ``Wake up governor,'' Bush said, ``we've done all that.''
   He defended the Reagan administration's record on conventional
forces against Dukakis' past charges that such forces have been
slighted in the push for new, big-ticket strategic weapons systems.
Bush dismissed that as ``misinformation.''
   ``Governor, it's time to stop running down our defenses,'' he
said.
   He also ridiculed Dukakis for supporting some research into Star
Wars while dismissing the proposed space-based missile-defense
system as a fantasy.
   Dukakis and his campaign staff were embracing the idea of
running as the underdog. To underscore his resolve, Dukakis said
``My spirits are good'' and took trumpet in hand to play ``Happy
Days Are Here Again,'' a Democratic standard.
   Dukakis declared he was ``fighting for the values I believe
in,'' and, in a touch of populism, told workers at a copper and
brass plant, ``I want to be the president who stands up and fights
for you.''
   He pointed to recent trade figures showing imports to the United
States were at an all-time high in August and said Bush ``has not
given the American people a clue as to what he would do'' to
reverse the trade deficit.
   ``George Bush sat on the sidelines for eight years while America
got beaten in world markets, ... while a piece of America was being
sold off every day at bargain-basement prices,'' he said.
   He also disputed Bush's standard speech line that he wants ``a
kinder gentler nation.''
   ``His record tells rural America, the fewer family farmers the
better. His record tells middle class families, the glory days are
over. Your kids may not do as well as you,'' Dukakis said.
   Bentsen, trying to save some of the South for the Democrats,
said Dukakis was not planning cuts in defense spending and defended
him against television ads playing in the South that hit Dukakis as
an advocate of gun control.
   ``I sure wouldn't be running with any fellow if I thought he was
going to take my shotgun away from me,'' Bentsen said in Texarkana,
on the Texas-Arkansas border.
   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle dropped in
unannounced at a Flint, Mich., Burger King restaurant, where he
talked about sports and wood-burning stoves over coffee with
customers.
   He also took a page from Dukakis' campaign book by pledging
``good jobs at good wages'' _ the phrase Dukakis has used since the
primaries.
   In a series of stops across Michigan, where the auto industry
has been hard hit by foreign competition, Quayle called for ``fair,
free trade'' without resorting to ``protectionist barriers.''
   Meanwhile, Bush won the endorsement of the Teamsters executive
board Monday after a poll of the nation's largest union gave him a
four-point margin over Dukakis, union officials said.
   Just 21,207 members of the 1.7 million-strong Teamsters voted in
the poll, said union president William J. McCarthy, who is from
Massachusetts and has been critical of the governor.
   The union has not endorsed a Democrat for president since 1968
but had a falling out with the Republican Reagan administration in
1986 over the indictment of union president Jackie Presser.
   The union would endorse neither Quayle nor the Republican Party,
however.
   The Bush campaign, meanwhile has begun a new television ad
saying Bush would be more qualified to negotiate with Soviet Leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. ``This is not time to train somebody in how
to meet with the Russians,'' the ad says. ``This is the time for
somebody who's ready on day one to be president.''
   The 30-second ad began running over the weekend.

   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres said
Monday that if he is elected prime minister in Nov. 1 elections,
Palestinians in the occupied territories will elect delegates to
peace talks with Israel.
   Peres spoke on a day when 16 Palestinians were reported shot in
clashes with troops in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Also Monday, two Israeli soldiers were wounded, one seriously,
apparently from a Palestinian firebomb attack, an army spokesman
said. He said the circumstances of the incident in the West Bank
village of Azzun were unclear and still under investigation.
   A home-made bomb was thrown on Monday at police guarding the
home of former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon in the Moslem sector
of the walled Old City, police said. They said no injury or damage
resulted and that the attacker escaped despite police gunfire.
   It was the second unsuccessful attack on the house in less than
a month.
   Sharon, now industry minister, was away, on a private visit to
Hungary.
   Peres said balloting in the territories would be held only if
calm is restored.
   ``If the violence is restrained, we will hold free elections in
Judea, Samaria and Gaza so that a Palestinian ... delegation can be
elected to represent the Palestinian side in negotiations,'' Peres
said, using the biblical names for the West Bank.
   The suggestion was rejected by several Palestinian leaders,
including Israeli-deposed Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natsche. He told The
Associated Press that before any elections, ``Israel must recognize
our right to self-determination and our right to choose our own
representatives.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, whose hard-line Likud bloc is
Labor's main opponent, said ``nothing will remain'' of Palestinian
protesters if they carry out threats to use weapons against Israel.
   Likud opposes giving back any of the territories occupied by
Israel since the 1967 Middle East war. Labor favors trading some
land for peace.
   Polls say the two major parties are in a close race. Much of the
campaigning has centered on the Palestinian uprising, which has
claimed the lives of 299 Arabs and six Israelis since Dec. 8.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a Labor Party member who joined
Peres at a news conference to announce the peace talk election
proposal, said Palestinian representatives must be chosen ``from
residents of the territories, by residents of the territories.''
   Rabin said any resident of the territories could run in the
elections. But he said at least three months of calm would have to
precede the balloting.
   The last elections in the West Bank were mayoral elections in
1976 under a Labor administration. The elected officials supported
the Palestine Liberation Organization and refused to participate in
peace negotiations.
   Peres said that if formal peace negotiations fail, he would
transfer local and municipal affairs now handled by the army to
elected Palestinians.
   Peres continues to insist that Jordan be part of any peace talks
despite King Hussein's statement this summer that he was breaking
all links with the West Bank, which Jordan held from 1948 until
1967.
   Peres is trying to win the votes of Israeli Arabs, who comprise
17 percent of the electorate and traditionally split their votes
between Labor and the Communist Party.
   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Shamir, criticized the Labor
proposal and said holding elections during the uprising would only
serve to give radicals the upper hand.
   Among the casualties Monday were four Palestinians in the Nablus
area, including a 13-year-old boy who was shot in the back after
youths hurled rocks at troops, an Arab reporter said.
   In the Gaza Strip, troops shot eight youths with plastic bullets
and wounded four with live ammunition during stone-throwing clashes
in four Palestinian refugee camps, Arab reports and hospital
officials said. One of the wounded was a 13-year-old boy hit in the
eye with a plastic bullet, the officials said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   Israel radio quoted an army medical officer as saying 575
soldiers and 321 Israeli civilians have been injured in the
uprising. Most were hit by stones.
   Israeli officials have said more than 7,000 Palestinians have
been injured in the revolt.

   East bloc nations will hold a human rights
conference in Moscow on Nov. 21-25 as part of U.N.-sponsored
activities marking the 40th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, Tass said Monday.
   The official Soviet news agency quoted Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov as saying the seminar ``on human
rights and the administration of justice'' would be the first
organized by the United Nations with the participation of socialist
countries.
   Tass said the conference would be attended by prominent foreign
and Soviet specialists, including U.N. officials, representatives
of law enforcement institutions, legal scholars and public figures.
   Jan Maertenson, U.N. deputy director general and director of the
U.N. Center on Human Rights, will speak at the opening ceremony,
Tass said.
   The Soviet Union also has proposed holding an international
conference on human rights in Moscow, but the United States and
other Western countries have been cool to the idea.
   U.S. representatives have said they are seeking guarantees that
members of non-governmental groups will be allowed to attend, as
well as private foreign citizens who have grievances to air.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury indicted Rep. Pat Swindall
on perjury charges Monday, accusing the two-term Republican
congressman of lying during a money laundering investigation.
   Swindall, locked in what has been called one of the country's
dirtiest congressional re-election battles, pleaded innocent to all
counts during an afternoon arraignment and was free on his own
recognizance.
   He said he hoped to bring the case to trial next Monday in order
to clear his name by the Nov. 8 general election.
   ``When I am exonerated, obviously the only issue that remains is
whether the 4th District wants a Dukakis liberal or a Bush
conservative,'' he told reporters at U.S. District Court.
   Swindall said he would resign if he were convicted of the
charges, even though not required to by law. He said he expects to
serve a jail term if found guilty.
   He said he would step down ``because under the circumstances, I
don't think it would be fair to the voters of the 4th District'' to
remain in office.
   His Democratic opponent, former ``Dukes of Hazzard'' television
actor Ben Jones, commented, ``I feel concern for the congressman
and for his family at this point. ... It is a matter for the courts
to decide.''
   The 10-count indictment accused Swindall of lying to the grand
jury last Feb. 2 during its investigation of a proposed $850,000
home mortgage loan the congressman had discussed with an Atlanta
businessman and an undercover agent posing as a financier.
   Among other things, the indictment charged that Swindall lied
when he told the grand jury he did not go to authorities to report
the loan negotiations, because, he said, ``I never satisfied myself
of anything with respect to criminality.''
   The indictment also charged Swindall lied when he said there had
never been discussions about trying to conceal the trail of the
money, and that he lied when he denied having been specifically
informed by the undercover agent that the source of the loan could
be illicit drug money.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr said that if convicted, Swindall could
be sentenced to five years in prison and fined $10,000 on each
count.
   Swindall, who had been notified of the pending indictment in
advance, announced Sunday night that he expected to be indicted and
said he was excited by the prospect because it would give him a
chance to clear his name.
   He said he would waive a number of rights, including the right
to charge the government with misconduct, so the case could go to
trial next Monday. Swindall said he would act as his own attorney.
   Swindall entered his innocent plea before U.S. Magistrate
William L. Harper, who then assigned the case to U.S. District
Judge Robert Vining.
   Vining had previously been scheduled to try Atlanta businessman
Charles LeChasney and a second person accused of money laundering
next Monday. Harper said there were indications LeChasney and the
second man might step aside and allow Swindall's case to be tried
ahead of their cases.
   Swindall, who defeated Jones in 1986, this year has made an
issue of Jones' arrest record, including a conviction for
assaulting his wife. Jones has said the incidents occurred during a
bout with alcoholism that ended in 1977.
   Jones, who starred as ``Cooter'' in the long-running television
series, ``The Dukes of Hazzard,'' once suggested that Swindall
submit to drug tests, insinuating the congressman's behavior was
unstable.
   The indictment stems from negotiations Swindall undertook last
year with LeChasney to finance a mortgage loan for his $1.2 million
home.
   LeChasney, who has since been indicted on money-laundering
charges, introduced Swindall to Michael Mullaney, an undercover
Internal Revenue Service agent posing as a money broker.
   In June, Atlanta newspapers obtained several secretly made
government tape recordings of conversations among Swindall,
LeChasney and the undercover agent.
   The tapes showed that Swindall continued to pursue negotiations
for an $850,000 loan after being told that the source might be drug
money he would be helping to launder.
   He accepted a $150,000 check as the first installment on the
loan, but returned it uncashed three days later, saying he was
suspicious of LeChasney's business dealings.
   Swindall has since apologized for his role in the negotiations,
calling it a mistake in judgment but insisting there was no
wrongdoing.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Teamsters, the nation's
largest union, voted Monday to back George Bush for president,
breaking with the AFL-CIO's endorsement of Michael Dukakis.
   However, union President William J. McCarthy emphasized that the
endorsement applied only to Bush personally, not his running mate,
Dan Quayle, nor the Republican party.
   The action came after only 21,207 of the union's 1.7 million
members returned mail-in presidential ballots giving Bush a 50.2
percent to 46.4 percent margin over his Democratic rival, said
McCarthy.
   He said the union would have backed Dukakis if the membership
poll had gone the other way, but he applauded the decision to back
Bush.
   ``We feel he is more qualified and can do a greater job for this
country,'' McCarthy said after the union's 18-member board of
directors ratified the membership vote during a meeting at the
Grenelefe Resort. ``We feel we can get a fair shake from him.''
   Reacting to the snub while campaigning in Midland, Mich., Quayle
said, ``The important thing is that they endorsed George Bush and
that's good news for me.''
   ``It's going to be important to have their votes,'' Quayle said.
   The union president insisted that the poll was fair despite the
small number of voters, saying all members had the opportunity to
register their opinions.
   The Teamsters have not backed a Democrat for president since
Vice President Humbert H. Humphrey in 1968.
   But when the union rejoined the AFL-CIO a year ago following a
30-year absence, officials for both had anticipated the Teamsters
would go along with the federation's expected endorsement of the
Democratic nominee.
   The deal apparently fell through when McCarthy took over the
union following the death of Jackie Presser.
   The AFL-CIO announced its endorsement of Dukakis in August, and
the Teamsters were one of three unions that abstained while 88
unions supported it, 87 of them unanimously.
   Teamster officials said then they expected the union to make no
endorsement, a stand the Teamsters last took in 1976 when Jimmy
Carter defeated incumbent President Gerald Ford.
   McCarthy, who headed the Teamsters in New England before taking
over the union, had crossed swords with Dukakis in Massachusetts,
backing his electoral opponents there.
   But he denied Monday that the Bush endorsement was intended to
spite Dukakis.
   ``I have no opinion of him,'' McCarthy said of the governor.
   Union spokesman Duke Zeller said the vote indicated Teamsters
are satisfied with the economy because they ``are concerned with
such bread-and-butter issues as jobs.''
   The Teamsters endorsed Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984, but the
union had a falling out with the administration in 1986 over
Presser's indictment.
   When he died in July after a long bout with cancer and heart
disease, Presser was under indictment in Cleveland for allegedly
hiring ghost employees for the union.
   The union is also the target of a federal civil racketeering
suit that was filed June 28. That suit seeks to have Teamsters
officials who violated racketeering laws removed from office and
replaced with a trustee.

<TEXT>
   A malfunctioning fan in a
plutonium-processing area caused the evacuation of about 100
employees at the Savannah River Plant Monday, but officials said
there was no contamination of the workers or the atmosphere.
   The fan broke down at 2:46 p.m., and was restarted about 30
minutes later, said plant spokesman Cliff Webb. The cause of the
equipment failure was under investigation.
   The exhaust fan is used to pull fresh air from the outside
through the building and out to filters that trap any radioactive
material. The air flow serves to remove any releases of
contamination from the building.
   But a fan failure could produce a reverse air flow, which could
allow contamination to accumulate in the building or be forced
outside.
   The amount of contamination would depend on how much plutonium
was being processed when such an accident occurred. Officials will
not discuss specifics on plutonium production.
   A backup fan normally would have been activated, but the second
unit was out of service for routine maintenance, Webb said.
   Meanwhile, about 700 employees elsewhere in F-Area, where
plutonium is refined for use in nuclear weapons, were detained
about an hour while an inventory of nuclear materials was
completed. Such inventories are routinely conducted, Webb said.

   The Cincinnati Post endorsed Republican George
Bush for president, praising him in an editorial in its Monday
afternoon editions for his experience in business and government.
   The editorial also called Bush's rival, Democrat Michael S.
Dukakis, ``one of the least prepared candidates for president in
recent years'' whose experience in government is limited to the
Massachussets Statehouse in Boston.
   Bush received endorsements Sunday from three other Ohio
newspapers: The Columbus Dispatch, The Cincinnati Enquirer and The
(Elyria) Chronicle-Telegram. Dukakis has received no Ohio newspaper
endorsements so far.
   The editorial by the Scripps Howard newspaper compared Bush's
resume as a wartime naval flier, businessman, congressman,
Republican national chairman, United Nations ambassador, U.S. envoy
to China and CIA director and said the comparison with Dukakis'
portfolio ``isn't even close.''

   A national poll Monday said George Bush held a
17-point lead in the presidential race, garnering 55 percent
support among likely voters compared with 38 percent for Democrat
Michael Dukakis.
   Bush's lead in the NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll was his
greatest of the campaign and considerably greater than in surveys
earlier this month. It was the first full-sized poll conducted
after last week's debate.
   Bush led by 10 points in smaller, overnight polls done
immediately after Thursday's debate, but they were conducted only
among debate viewers, a more Republican group. He led by five or
six points in most pre-debate polls.
   In the NBC-Journal poll, conducted Friday through Sunday among
1,378 likely voters, almost three-quarters said they expected Bush
to win the election, including half of Dukakis' own supporters.
   Dukakis and campaign chairman Paul Brountas disputed the
figures, as did running mate Lloyd Bentsen.
   ``Now we've got a new set of numbers that has absolutely no
relationship to anything that we have or other polls have, so you
spend two or three days'' answering answering questions about it,
Dukakis said.
   ``If there has been an increase in the gap it may be
attributable to some of the stories about the debate,'' Brountas
said.
   ``I don't think it's accurate,'' said Bentsen. ``You see wide
fluctuations among those polls. That's what's happening.''
   Dukakis' campaign received two blows last week: A 50-state poll
by ABC News and the Washington Post said Bush had an overwhelming
lead in the race for electoral votes, and polls said Bush was seen
as the debate winner.
   Bush was favorably rated by 55 percent in the NBC-Journal poll,
up from 50 percent a month ago. Dukakis' favorability rating
dropped to 36 percent, down from 50 percent a month ago.
   Bush's advantage was chiefly among men: They backed him by a 2-1
margin, 64-30, while the race among women was a nearly even 48-44.
A gender gap has been apparent, to varying degrees, throughout the
campaign.
   The poll's margin of error was plus or minus three percentage
points.

   Choreographer Rallou Manou, widely
recognized for introducing modern dance in Greece, has died of a
stroke at the age of 73.
   Ms. Manou, who directed the Hellenic Chorodrama that she helped
set up with leading Greek artists in 1951, died Saturday.
   The daughter of a wealthy Greek army officer, Ms. Manou studied
dance in West Germany before working under American modern dance
pioneer Martha Graham at New York University in the 1940s.
   Works presented by the Hellenic Chorodrama, of which Ms. Manou
was the principal choreographer, blended avant-garde dance forms
with classical drama.
   She insisted that the dance group, which performed each summer
in the open-air Lycabettus theater in Athens, be inspired by Greek
tradition.
   ``I don't think ballet is the kind, type or spirit of dance that
can best express Greece,'' she once said. ``Modern dance is the
best form and also the one which comes nearest to ancient Greek
dance.''

   A tropical storm off the South American coast
reached hurricane force Monday with winds of more than 80 mph as
the system gathered strength over open water, forecasters said.
   Hurricane Joan, the fifth hurricane of the Atlantic season, was
upgraded from tropical storm status Monday night and could
intensify as it moves away from the Colombian coast and into the
western Caribbean, the National Hurricane Center reported.
   The storm's winds, which had dropped to 45 mph Sunday, rose to
at least 80 mph in an area northwest of the center and 75 mph winds
over most of the system, just above the minimum 74 mph hurricane
level.
   At 9 p.m. EDT, Joan's center was near latitude 11.9 north and
longitude 74.1 west, or just west of the Guajira Peninsula of
Colombia, and 520 miles east of the island of San Andres off the
coast of Nicaragua. The hurricane was moving west at 10 mph and was
expected to continue that motion through Tuesday.
   Four to 8 inches of rain is forecast along Joan's path.
   ``It's a straight shot to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, but it's not
there yet. There is no threat for the next 60 hours or so,'' said
center forecaster Jim Gross.
   Joan became the 10th named system of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane
season Oct. 11 when top winds passed the minimum 39 mph mark to
qualify for classification as a tropical storm.
   There have been four other hurricanes so far this season,
including Hurricane Gilbert, which left more than 300 people dead
and caused billions of dollars in damage as it tore through
Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.
   The hurricane season extends from June 1 to Nov. 30.

   Michael Dukakis reached for the common touch
on Monday, visiting a metal factory, a diner and a bowling alley as
he tried to reinvigorate a faltering presidential campaign.
   ``I want to be a president who stands up and fights for American
companies, American products and American workers,'' Dukakis said,
depicting Republican rival George Bush as the candidate of
complacency.
   The Massachusetts governor embraced the role of underdog as
polls in Ohio and elsewhere showed him losing ground since last
week's presidential debate.
   An NBC Wall Street Journal poll reported Bush leading 55 percent
to 38 percent, but Dukakis disputed the fundings.
   ``Well I can only tell you that there are other polls that say
very different things about where we are and where the race is,''
Dukakis told an interviewer for a Chicago television station.
   Dukakis, in a series of interviews, described the race as ``very
tight'' and said, ``the business of polls is really having a
terrible effect'' on the campaign process.
   ``Now we've got a new set of numbers that has absolutely no
relationship to anything that we have or other polls have, so you
spend two or three days'' answering answering questions about it.
   He declined to say what his internal campaign polling shows.
   The governor's day was designed to counter criticism that he has
failed to connect emotionally with middle class voters,
particularly those in the industrial states.
   Dukakis ended his day more than 12 hours after he began at a
rally in Columbus attended by blacks and he took a veiled shot at
Bush. ``Something is very wrong when a presidential candidate calls
Jesse Helms a hero, and Jesse Jackson a hustler,'' he said. Bush
once used that term to describe Jackson in a newspaper interview.
   His first stop was a brass and copper factory in Euclid near
Cleveland, where he toured the plant wearing a jacket that bore two
pocket patches, one saying, ``Mike'' and the other ``Next
President.''
   Addressing workers at a factory-floor rally, he criticized Bush
for opposing increases in the minimum wage and for advocating a
trade policy that he said seemed like ``a re-run of Let's Make a
Deal.''
   He said Bush has ``sat on his hands while America's industrial
heartland has been fighting for its life.''
   Next was a brief visit to Shorty's diner in Cleveland, where he
joined a patron and his daughter at a booth. ``Let's kick some ass
out there,'' said the man, Tim LaChina. ``OK, very good, we'll do
it,'' said Dukakis.
   In Dayton, he went to a bowling alley for a meeting with
families, many of whom said they were worried about the threat of
drugs and concerned about meeting the costs of higher education.
   In his factory speech, he said Bush assures the voters
``everything's fine, not to worry. ...
   ``But his record sends a very different message. ... His record
tells America's industrial heartland, `Let it rust,''' Dukakis said.
   The Massachusetts governor told reporters, ``My spirits are
good'' as he set out on a campaign swing through industrial states.
And he twice took trumpet in hand to make a stab at a few bars of
``Happy Days Are Here Again.''
   But the political news for Dukakis was anything but happy as
newspaper polls in the wake of last week's presidential debate
indicated Bush holds a double-digit lead in Ohio. Dukakis is
expected to return two or three times before Election Day to the
state, one of several in the Northeast and Midwest that form the
core of his hopes for a come-from-behind victory in the race for
the White House.
   Dukakis has decided to campaign as the underdog he is for the
final three weeks of the campaign, and in his new campaign speech,
he said he is ``fighting for the values I believe in, the values
that are at the core of this campaign.''
   He said Bush has ``sat on his hands while America's heartland
has been fighting for its life'' and now won't be specific about
what he would do as president.
   ``Take trade, for example. ... Mr. Bush's trade policy is like a
re-run of `Let's Make A Deal.' Letting the voters guess what's
behind door No. 1, door No. 2 and door No. 3,'' Dukakis said.
   ``George Bush sat on the sidelines for eight years while America
got beaten in world markets ... while a piece of America was being
sold off every day at bargain-basement prices,'' he said.
   Dukakis said he would work hard to create good jobs at good
wages, adding, ``That's not just a slogan, that comes from the
gut.''
   Bush says he believes in the dignity of work, Dukakis noted. But
he said the vice president opposed legislation mandating a 60-day
notice to workers before their factory could be closed and voted
for a budget plan that would have frozen Social Security
cost-of-living increases.
   ``...Mr. Bush saw nothing, said nothing and did nothing while
his Republican colleagues in Congress used every trick in the book
to keep the minimum wage a poverty wage,'' of $3.35 an hour, he
said.
   Dukakis taunted Bush's oft-repeated declaration that he wants a
``kinder, gentler nation.''
   ``His record tells rural America, the fewer family farmers the
better. His record tells middle class families: `The glory days are
over. Your kids may not do as well as you.'''

   A man who barricaded himself in his apartment
building shot and killed two police officers Monday before he was
killed by police to end the nearly seven-hour siege, authorities
said.
   Relatives said the gunman, identified as Charles Knowles, was
distraught because he had been beaten and robbed Sunday night.
Police spokesman Fred Zaharoff said Knowles, 50, had a history of
mental instability.
   Police went to the three-story apartment building about 8 a.m.
after receiving reports that Knowles had threatened other tenants
and was pouring gasoline inside the building, said Zaharoff.
   Knowles fired through the door of his apartment about 9:30 a.m.,
striking Lt. James L. Schmit in the chest, Zaharoff said. Schmit
died at Samaritan Hospital after surgery for a chest wound,
hospital spokeswoman Kay LeMon said.
   Negotiations with Knowles continued while about 25 families in
and near the apartment building were kept from their homes,
Zaharoff said.
   ``Exhaustive attempts by police officers and members of the
Knowles family to talk him into surrendering were of no avail,''
the spokesman said. ``The decision to enter the dwelling was made
after considering the fact that Mr. Knowles had poured gasoline
through the apartment building which may have been ignited as
children were about to be dismissed from schools in the area.''
   The police's Special Response Unit forced their way into
Knowles's apartment about 2:05 p.m., Zaharoff said. Knowles fired
as they entered and struck Officer Frank E. Walls, who died about
30 minutes later at St. John Hospital, officials said.
   Other officers returned fire and killed Knowles instantly,
Zaharoff said.
   Schmit, 41, was a 20-year veteran, and Walls, 39, was a 13-year
veteran.
   The gunman's nephew, Rick Knowles, said his uncle was retired,
lived alone and had been a victim of other crimes in recent months.
   Charles Knowles's apartment had been burglarized several months
ago after police took him into custody, Rick Knowles said. The
nephew said he did not know what offense was involved in that
arrest but added that Charles Knowles had bought a rifle afterward.
   ``The police came in today, he probably said, `Leave me alone,'
'' Rick Knowles said. ``They tried to get in anyway, and he just
popped them.''

<HEAD>Israel Says Egypt Agreed To Delay Taba Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Egypt has agreed to postpone talks on the
future of the disputed Taba border area until after the Israeli
elections, Israel's Foreign Ministry said Monday.
   Egypt informed Israel of its decision through its ambassador in
Israel, Mohammed Bassiouny, and through the Israeli ambassador in
Cairo, Shimon Shamir, a ministry official said. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Israel radio said the decision followed U.S. pressure to delay
the negotiations until after Nov. 1 parliamentary elections in
Israel and the U.S. presidential elections Nov. 8.
   The radio said talks were expected to begin at the end of
November or the beginning of December.
   Israel captured Taba, a 250-acre Red Sea beachfront resort,
along with the Sinai desert from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war
but did not return it when Israel returned Sinai to Egypt uder a
U.S.-mediated peace treaty.
   Last month, after more than 16 months of study, an international
panel of arbitrators ruled that Taba should be returned to Egypt.
The five-member panel awarded Egypt some key border points but said
it was not authorized to determine the final position of the border.
   In addition to demarcating the border, the ongoing
Israeli-Egyptian negotiations are supposed to determine the future
of the strip's popular Sonesta Hotel and a cabana Israel has had in
Taba since 1967.

   Three young whales trapped by ice were
battered and bleeding and appeared to be weakening Monday, while a
huge military helicopter prepared to tow an ice-breaking barge
hundreds of miles in a last-ditch effort to free them.
   Rescuers used chain saws to keep two small breathing holes open
in the six-inch thick Arctic Ocean ice, but freezing temperatures
threatened to close them. The whales became trapped nearly two
weeks ago while migrating south to warmer waters.
   The endangered California gray whales, about 24 to 30 feet long,
were bleeding and battered from continually bashing into the jagged
ice and were exhausted from swimming against the ocean current to
remain in place.
   ``They don't look as spry. Their movements are diminished,'' Ron
Morris of the National Marine Fisheries Service said Monday.
   ``Their condition has worsened since they were first spotted.
One has a little pneumonia but the others are all right. But
there's no question in my mind that they'll be here when the
vehicle arrives,'' said Morris.
   The whales were trapped about 18 miles northeast of this Inupiat
Eskimo village. They were only a few hundred feet offshore in 45
feet of water, with their largest breathing hole about 10 feet by
20 feet.
   The whales ordinarily can stay underwater nearly four minutes,
said Geoff Carroll, a wildlife biologist with the North Slope
Borough. Carroll said they have been surfacing about every two
minutes, indicating they were becoming tired and stressed.
   Rescuers were racing against onshore winds that threatened to
close leads in the ice that would serve as the whales' escape route
if the ice-breaking barge is able to free them.
   Environmentalists, federal authorities and the oil industry have
joined in an unlikely alliance to rush a barge to the whales so
that it can smash a path to open water some seven miles away.
   A spindly Army National Guard CH-54 Skycrane planned to lift off
from Prudhoe Bay to tow the 185-ton barge 200 miles northwest to
the beleaguered whales. The trip was expected to take from 25 to 40
hours.
   Crews labored around-the-clock during the weekend to get the
barge and the Skycrane ready to go. The vessel, a Hovercraft-type
barge, belongs to Veco Inc., an oil field service company.
   Crews were being especially cautious as they prepared the rig
Monday.
   ``We're checking under the rig, checking the airbags and
checking anything that can go wrong,'' said Pete Leathard, a Veco
spokesman. ``We're not going to move that thing until we can make
sure we'll have a clean run to Barrow. The Arctic is not a good
place to break down in winter.''
   Plans called for the helicopter to pull the 85-by-60-foot barge
with an 800-foot cable, said Mike Haller, spokesman for the Alaska
National Guard.
   ``The plan has great potential for danger because of the atitude
of the helicopter in the towing position. The nose is down,'' he
said. ``The danger is that if a line snaps and comes back up and
gets in the rotors, we've got real trouble.''
   The helicopter, which costs $1,500 to $3,000 an hour to operate,
will trade off with a second Skycrane which has been flown to
Prudhoe Bay. The barge carried 20,000 gallons of fuel for the
helicopters and the barge, Haller said. The fuel was provided by
Arco Alaska Inc.
   Oil company officials have estimated the rescue effort could
cost as much as $500,000.
   Greenpeace representative Cindy Lowry arrived in Barrow on
Sunday with recordings of migrating whales which she wants to play
along the ice floe to lure the whales to safety.
   The population of endangered California gray whales numbers
about 20,000 and has been growing at an annual average of 2.5
percent for the past decade, authorities said.
   The whales spend their winters in the warm waters off Mexico and
Southern California.

<TEXT>
   The United States and the Philippines
concluded an agreement Monday to guarantee U.S. military use of
strategic air and naval bases in the Southeast Asian country
through 1991 in exchange for $962 million in American aid.
   That represents an increase of $258 million in economic and
military assistance as part of a complicated arrangement that
permits the Philippines to use ``a substantial portion'' to reduce
its debt and bars American soldiers who test positive for AIDs from
serving in the country.
   The successful conclusion of what at times had been difficult
negotiations could foreshadow extension of the U.S. military
presence in the strategic Asian nation beyond 1991, but the terms
will have to be negotiated between the two sides, probably
beginning next year.
   Another key provision of the agreement, which was released as
Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Foreign Secretary Raul
Manglapus signed the pact, maintains the U.S. policy of not
disclosing whether ships or planes stopping at the bases or passing
through carry nuclear weapons.
   ``These transits, overflights or visits will be conducted in
accordance with existing procedures, which may be changed or
modified, as necessary, by mutual agreement of both parties,'' the
memorandum said.
   However, the Philippines government has the power to prohibit
storing nuclear, chemical or other non-conventional weaponry on its
territory.
   The nuclear issue was one of the key items that had to be
settled before the United States could be assured continued use of
Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and four lesser installations.
   The accord also deeds to the Philippines all permanent
facilities and improvements on buildings at the bases. The two
governments pledged, meanwhile, to take steps to ensure a smooth
transition of the bases to Philippine control if the United States
decides in the future to abandon them.
   In a ceremony in the State Department's Treaty Room, Manglapus
said that once Filipinos realize what the agreement gives them,
they ``will accept it as an agreement that is in keeping with the
expectations of our people, not only in the matter of compensation
... but also to other issues that we feel to be relevant to the
question of national dignity.''
   The agreement covers only the next two years. A U.S. statement
said the United States hoped to begin talks with the Philippines
government on use beyond 1991 ``in not too distant future.''
   Manglapus said the review does not resolve issues of criminal
jurisdiction and military operations, which are likely to come up
in the next talks. The Philippines wants jurisdicton over U.S.
soldiers who commit crimes and prior notice on any U.S. military
operations conducted from the bases.
   Manglapus said President Corazon Aquino would be influenced on
the future of the bases by Filipinos' reaction to the agreement but
was ``keeping her options open.''
   Shultz quipped: ``Both sides are keeping their options open.''
   He said the United States was ``just thrilled'' with the return
of democracy in the Philippines and takes great pleasure and
satisfaction with developments in Manila.
   ``I`m bullish on the Phillipines and this is a continuation of
that effort,'' Shultz said.
   The agreement set the terms for U.S. use of the bases through
1991. Technically, the negotiations were a review of an existing
bases agreement that the Aquino government never hinted at
canceling, but the bargaining over the U.S. aid package, the
nuclear issue and other key features contributed to a dramatic and
politically tense chapter in U.S. relations with the former
American colony.
   President Reagan on Monday wrote Mrs. Aquino in a three-page
letter released at the ceremony that the agreement confirmed that
the bases arrangement ``continues to meet our mutual needs and
interests.''
   But he reminded the Philippine president that Congress has the
authority to appropriate the aid covered in the accord.
   Military and economic aid to the Philippines is to be boosted to
$481 million a year. That is more than 2{ times the $180 million a
year Reagan pledged in 1983 over a five-year period to former
President Ferdinand Marcos and $129 million above the $352 million
the United States is providing this year to the Aquino government.
   Manglapus said Sunday that the pact also includes an agreement
on nuclear weapons and U.S. backing for a bond program aimed at
reducing the Philippines' $28 billion debt.
   Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base are considered vital to
regional and Western security interests across a wide part of the
world stretching from the Pacific to the Persian Gulf.
   The terms fall short of the $1.2 billion that Philippine sources
said Manglapus originally wanted. He said, however, that U.S. and
Philippine officials were never far apart on actual cash
compensation in talks that began April 5 in Manila. He said the
disagreements were over U.S. failure to approve benefits and
concessions that would not require congressional approval.
   Apart from the U.S. military and economic aid, the agreement
calls for U.S. underwriting of the cost of Philippine security
measures up to $4 million a year if funds can be found.
   The pact is expected to lead to talks next year on the long-term
future of the bases, which many Filipinos want removed after the
lease lapses in 1991. Mrs. Aquino has not said whether she supports
U.S. use of the bases after 1991. Any new treaty would have to be
approved by a two-thirds vote of the Philippine Senate and a
possible referendum.
   Failure to conclude the bases review, originally scheduled for
July, has delayed Reagan administration endorsement of a $5 billion
multilateral aid program proposed by two Republican and two
Democratic members of Congress. White House sources have said the
president backs the plan, but it could not be set up until the
amount of the base compensation was set.
   The debt relief plan linked to the bases accord is complex. It
calls for the United States to put up U.S. Treasury bonds that
would back a Philippine bond issue that initially would be
exchanged for outstanding debts at 50 cents on the dollar,
Manglapus said.
   Philippine officials previously said they would ask that the
United States put up $100 million in U.S. Treasury bonds to back a
Philippine bond issue.
   Manglapus said U.S. officials agreed that the money would come
from stepped-up payments of delayed fiscal 1988 and 1989 aid that
previously could not be used to pay off the debt.

   Syria's allies in Lebanon staged a
daylong general strike throughout the country's Moslem regions on
Monday to protest Iraq's recognition of a Christian military
Cabinet as the constitutional government.
   It came as Christian deputies decided to boycott a session of
Parliament set for Tuesday to elect a new speaker. Leaving
Parliament without a speaker would undermine one of the last
vestiges of a united Lebanon.
   The strike shut schools, stores, banks, cafes, restaurants and
other businesses in west Beirut. Police said similar shutdowns
paralyzed Lebanon's northern, eastern and southern provinces.
   Street posters in west Beirut, Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre and Baalbek
read, ``Iraq's meddling threatens to break Lebanon'' and ``Hands
off Lebanon.''
   The strike reflected Syrian alarm over Iraq's military and
political support of Christian forces seeking the withdrawal of
40,000 Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon.
   Iraq and Syria, governed by rival wings of the Arab Socialist
Baath party, have been at odds since the mid-1960s.
   Christian areas north and northeast of Beirut and a border
enclave run by Israel and its predominantly Christian militia
allies in south Lebanon did not participate in the strike.
   Iraq reportedly shipped multibarreled rocket launchers, tanks
and armored personnel carriers to the Lebanese Forces, the
Christians' main militia in Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war.
   The arms were seen as intended to stir trouble for Syria, Iran's
main Arab ally in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war that was halted by a
cease-fire Aug. 20. Syria considers Lebanon within its sphere of
influence.
   Iraq last week became the only Arab country to recognize the
military Cabinet of Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun,
appointed by President Amin Gemayel minutes before Gemayel's term
ended Sept. 22.
   In Damascus, an editorial in the English-language Syria Times
accused Iraq of collaborating with Israel to undermine Lebanon's
unity.
   Other Arab states have have remained neutral in the struggle
between Aoun's three-man Cabinet and the Syrian-backed, five-man
government of acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem.
   The power struggle is solidifying a de facto partition of
Lebanon into sectarian cantons because of Parliament's failure to
elect a successor to Gemayel. Right-wing Christian members of
Parliament have sabotaged the required quorum by boycotting
sessions to elect a new president.
   The Christian deputies said they will boycott Tuesday's session,
called to extend Shiite Moslem speaker Hussein Husseini's mandate,
or elect a successor.
   That could lead to disintegration of the Parliament.
   The Christians also are demanding a different meeting site for
Parliament, citing security.

   A new Czechoslovak independent political
group, Movement for Civil Freedom, issued a manifesto Monday
calling for political pluralism, a new democratic constitution and
freedom of intellectual life.
   A copy of the manifesto, made available to news media in Vienna,
said, ``The totalitarian form of government is the real cause of
the present crisis in Czechoslovakia.''
   The Czechoslovak government underwent a major reshuffle this
month.
   The document, signed by 122 Czechoslovak citizens, said the
Movement for Civil Freedom was set up in Prague on Oct.15.
   Among those listed as signing the manifesto were prominent
members of the Charter 77 rights group and other intellectuals in
official disgrace, including sociologist Rudolf Battek; journalist
Jiri Dienstbier; playwright Vaclav Havel; philosopher Ladislav
Hejdanek; Karel Srp, chairman of the Jazz Section, and writer
Ludvik Vaculik.
   Other demands in the manifesto included freedom of religion;
independent trade unions, and a demilitarized society.

   Japan and the United States have agreed to allow
90-day visits to each country without requiring visas, Foreign
Minister Sosuke Uno announced Tuesday.
   Uno said in a ministry press release that the new accord will go
into effect on Dec. 15. It exempts from visa requirements visits of
less than 90 days for non-occupational purposes.
   The United States is the 51st country to conclude such a pact
with Japan.
   In 1987, all but 100,000 of more than 2.3 million Japanese who
visited the United States stayed for less than 90 days and 410,000
of the 440,000 U.S. visitors to Japan were short-term travelers,
according to Japanese immigration officials.

   Two former officers of a western Pennsylvania
firm pleaded guilty Monday to providing false information on a
defense contract that inflated the cost of a fighter plane's radar
by $1.8 million.
   Wendell E. Hager, 58, of Greensburg, former president of Nuclear
Automation Inc. of North Huntingdon, Westmoreland County, and H.
Ray Rambler, 50, of Greenville, S.C., former vice president of
operations, entered guilty pleas before U.S. District Judge Donald
Ziegler.
   The men pleaded guilty to two counts of an 83-count federal
indictment handed up June 15. U.S. Attorney J. Alan Johnson said
the Justice Department will dismiss the remaining counts in return.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter V. Marcoline said the men
falsified documents when presenting Hughes Aircraft Corp. of El
Segundo, Calif., with hourly costs for the manufacture of actuators
used in the radar units of F-15 fighter planes.
   Johnson said the actuator is a hydraulically operated component
of the radar system located in the nose of the F-15. Each fighter
has two actuators to move the radar horizontally and vertically, he
said.
   In seeking payments from Sept. 1, 1982, to Oct. 1, 1986, the men
had Nuclear Automation's controller inflate the time needed to
build each actuator from 70 to 93 hours, resulting in an
overpayment by the government to Hughes, according to Marcoline.
   Johnson said the actuators were priced at about $6,500 each when
they averaged about $5,100 each to manufacture.
   Nuclear Automation, owned by Esterline Corp. of Darien, Conn.,
until November 1984, when it was acquired by Neoax Inc. of
Stamford, Conn., is still making the devices for the Air Force, the
government said.
   Hager and Rambler were released on bond pending completion of
presentence reports. Officials said they are to be sentenced Nov.
30 and face a maximum of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine on
each count.

   The Irish Republican Army said
it killed the sales manager of a contracting firm Monday because
the company carried out building maintenance for security forces.
   Norman McKeown, 39, died when a bomb attached to his car
exploded after he drove about 200 yards from his home in Dundonald,
on the outskirts of Belfast, said a spokesman for the Royal Ulster
Constabulary.
   McKeown's wife, Evelyn, was in the car but escaped with minor
injuries, said the spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with
British custom.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to drive the British from
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite the province with
the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland under a
socialist government.
   The IRA began a campaign to stop construction work for security
forces in August 1985.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Soviet U.N. delegation
amplified on Monday his nation's call for establishment of a U.N.
navy and an expanded role for peacekeepers.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky's statement to a U.N.
committee echoed Soviet proposals already put before the General
Assembly, but emphasized Soviet willingness to keep its innovations
within the current U.N. Charter.
   ``We regard as generally sound the existing order under which
U.N. peacekeeping operations are carried out,'' said Petrovsky.
   However, he reiterated a Soviet proposal for ``possible
stationing of U.N. observers along frontiers within the territory
of a country that seeks to protect itself from outside interference
at the request of that country alone.''
   Under present U.N. practice, peacekeepers are not deployed
unless all countries in the area consent.
   Petrovsky's proposal would be of interest to Afghanistan, a
Soviet ally, which has lodged numerous complaints that Islamic
rebels are using Pakistan as a base for staging cross-border raids
into Afghan territory.
   More than 100,000 Soviet troops are withdrawing from Afghanistan
under the U.N.-mediated Geneva Accords.
   Last month, however, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
said the next phase of the pullout depends on whether the Soviets
and Afghans receive a satisfactory response to their complaints of
Pakistan's alleged violations of the accords.
   Petrovsky also called for the use of U.N. peacekeepers in
troubled areas before conflict breaks out, and posting observers
along tense borders.
   The Soviet Union stands ready to set aside units of its military
forces for use in U.N. peacekeeping, he said, suggesting that many
nations also set aside troops who would serve as a reserve guard
for U.N. peacekeeping.
   Petrovsky offered the use of Soviet transports and logistical
support for the U.N. plan for independence for South-West Africa,
also known as Namibia, which is ruled by neighboring South Africa.
   Noting his previous calls for a U.N. naval task force for the
Persian Gulf, Petrovsky expanded the concept by suggesting the
formation of a U.N. navy, including minesweepers and escorts to
protect commercial ships in dangerous international waters.
   The United States, Britain, France and other Western democracies
have blocked similar packages of Soviet peacekeeping and
international security proposals in the last two General Assembly
sessions.
   Diplomats for the Western allies say many of the Soviet
proposals have merit, but when combined into a ``comprehensive''
security proposal, they amount to a restructuring of the U.N.
Charter, which the West opposes.
   Petrovsky's references to innovations ``in accordance with the
U.N. charter'' appeared to be intended to allay such fears.

   Two shoppers suspected of having a stolen
credit card shot and seriously wounded two security guards who
tried to apprehend them in a department store Monday, authorities
said.
   Customers and employees screamed and dove to the floor when
shots rang out Monday afternoon at the Lazarus Department Store in
Glendale Mall.
   ``I heard a lot of screaming,'' said salesman John Langdon. ``I
heard the gunshots and the glass breaking, people hitting the floor
and just screaming.''
   Police spokeswoman Wendy Snitko said five people went to the
store's handbag department, and two tried to use a credit card to
buy clothing.
   The clerk checked the card number, found that it had been stolen
and alerted security. Two unarmed plainclothes security officers
answered the call.
   ``We're not sure what caused the suspects to shoot,'' she said.
``One of the male suspects fired two shots, each shot striking one
of the security guards.''
   Randall Wright, 30, was in serious condition at Methodist
Hospital with a gunshot wound to the stomach. The other guard, Eric
D. Simmons, 25, was in serious but stable condition at Wishard
Hospital with a chest wound.
   Ms. Snitko said the clerk was not injured.
   Two men and a woman were arrested, and police were seeking two
other suspects, including a man believed to be the trigger man. No
charges had been filed.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Ng Plotted Sex Slayings with Accomplice</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor said Monday that Charles
Ng, wanted in California for allegedly carrying out a string of
murders, joined forces with a mass murderer in the early 1980s to
kidnap targets for sex slayings.
   As Ng's extradition hearing got under way amid tight security,
Federal Crown prosecutor Bruce McFarlane told a packed courtroom he
will argue that Ng and his companion Leonard Lake ``were acting in
concert to achieve the same overall objectives.''
   Ng, 27, has been serving a 4{-year sentence in Canada since his
conviction in December 1985 of armed robbery during a botched
shoplifting attempt in Calgary. He came to Canada after Lake
committed suicide.
   Lake later was linked to the deaths or disappearances of 22
people. That investigation led to the charges against Ng.
   McFarlane told the court that Ng _ whose name is pronounced Ing
_ and Lake became acquainted in the early 1980s.
   He said the two men moved to Calaveras County, about 120 miles
east of San Francisco, and built a series of underground rooms
referred to as ``the bunker.''
   There, McFarlane told the court, Ng and Lake began to formalize
a plan to kidnap people in the California area and take them to the
bunker for what he called their own sexual gratification.
   The extradition hearing, scheduled to last 5{ weeks, is to
determine whether there is sufficient evidence to send Ng back to
California, where he faces 25 charges, including at least 10 of
murder.
   Canada has a policy of not extraditing criminals who could face
the death penalty, and is entitled to ask for leniency under the
1986 Canada-U.S. extradition treaty. The final decision regarding
extradition rests with Justice Minister Ray Hnatyshyn.
   During Monday's court appearance, Ng, a former marine, sat in
the prisoner's box, wearing a navy T-shirt, and showed no emotion.
   He was shackled at the wrists and flanked by armed officers.
Spectators entering the courtroom were searched with metal
detectors.
   Sharon Sellitto, 40, of San Francisco, whose 39-year-old
brother, Paul Cosner, is one of a dozen people Ng is accused of
murdering, said outside the courtroom Monday she wanted to see Ng
face to face.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, I don't want to hate a 2-by-2 picture
that appears in all the newspapers,'' she said. ``I wanted to see
him in person and make it real.''
   Ng's lawyer, Don MacLeod, said that even if enough evidence is
found to extradite Ng, he will press Canadian authorities to demand
a U.S. guarantee his client won't be executed.

   Lawyers for former President Gen.
Leopoldo Galtieri asked a court Monday to cancel his trial for
alleged human rights abuses in a case that led to tensions between
soldiers and the civilian government.
   Galtieri was due to appear in Rosario Federal Court Wednesday to
answer charges stemming from the December 1976 shooting deaths of
13 political prisoners.
   Eighteen other retired generals or admirals face similar charges
in trials that are resuming after a lapse of more than a year.
Officers still are reluctant to testify. They have said the
proceedings should be in military, not civilian court _ if held at
all.
   ``There is a situation of understandable uneasiness,'' Defense
Minister Horacio Jaunarena was quoted as saying in an Oct. 11
interview in the newspaper La Nacion. ``(But) there is not the
remotest possibility of a change in the (political) order.''
   Low pay also has contributed to grumbling in the barracks,
Jaunarena said. He said a general earns about $1,053 a month and a
conscript is paid about $5 a month. The national minimum wage is
about $87 a month, he said.
   Military salaries have not kept up with inflation, which has
soared 440 percent during the past 12 months. Also, the military
share of the federal budget has shrunk by half since President Raul
Alfonsin took office in December 1983. It now stands at about 2
percent.
   Alfonsin replaced a military dictatorship that had ruled since
President Isabel Peron was ousted by a coup in 1976. The human
rights abuses occurred for the most part in the mid-1970s during
the military's crackdown on leftists.
   A government commission issued a report in 1985 that said almost
9,000 people were arrested by security forces and never seen again.
   In December 1985, five of the nine military officers who served
in ruling juntas between 1976 and 1983, including former presidents
Gen. Jorge Videla and Gen. Roberto Viola, were convicted by federal
court for crimes including kidnapping, torture and murder.
   Galtieri, president from December 1981 through June 1982, was
commander of the 2nd Army Corps in Rosario on Dec. 13, 1976, when
the political prisoners were slain.
   Soldiers of the 2nd Army Corps said the 13 tried to escape while
being transferred from one jail to another. Witnesses said they
were deliberately killed.
   Galtieri's attorneys initially asked the Supreme Court to cancel
the trial because only the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the
military's highest court, was legally empowered to try Galtieri.
   The Supreme Court rejected that argument on Oct. 3.
   On Monday, defense attorneys claimed Galtieri was tried and
acquitted of the massacre during the 1985 trial. Prosecutors
rejected that claim. The Rosario Federal Court was expected to rule
shortly whether trial would go ahead as scheduled.
   Rosario, Argentina's third largest city with 1 million
residents, lies 185 miles northwest of the capital, Buenos Aires.
   Galtieri currently is serving a 12-year sentence after he was
convicted by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces in May 1986 of
mismanaging the 1982 war with Britain over the Falkland Islands.
   A civilian court is reviewing that decision. Prosecutor Luis
Moreno Ocampo has asked Buenos Aires Federal Court to increase the
sentence to 18 years in prison.
   Relations between the civilian government and the military, in
power for most of the years between the 1955 coup that ousted
President Juan D. Peron and Alfonsin's election five years ago,
have always been sensitive.
   In April 1987, three garrisons revolted after Maj. Ernesto
Barreiro refused to appear in court and face trial for alleged
human rights violations.
   A month later, Congress passed the ``Due Obedience'' law that
stated only generals could be charged with human rights abuses from
that point on. Cases against hundreds of lower-ranking officers
were dropped, because they allegedly were only following orders.
   Alfonsin, who proposed the legislation, said it was necessary to
avert civil war.

   A Uganda Airlines jet with 52 people aboard crashed,

   All of the surviving 23 people on Flight 775 from London's
Gatwick airport to Entebbe, Uganda, via Rome, were apparently

demolished an unoccuppied brick house and then barreled through the
parking lot of a rental car agency.
   At that point, an engine and part of a wing fell off and the
impact started a fire that destroyed about 75 cars.

1988 Nobel Prize in medicine today for their discoveries leading to
a series of new drugs.
   The Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute, which awards the

in the treatment of heart disease. The work of Elion and Hitchings,
who have collaborated since 1945, led to a series of drugs for the
treatment of cancer.
   The Americans' research also led to the development of drugs for

   A year after Black Monday, Americans are
optimistic about the economy and their personal finances, but are
deeply wary of Wall Street, a Media General-Associated Press poll
has found.
   Seventy-one percent of the 1,125 adults in the national survey
said they regard the stock market as a risky investment, and a
third saw a good chance it will plummet again in the next year or
two.
   But three-quarters said the crash had little or no effect on
their lives, and only one in 10 said their finances had worsened
during the past year. Even among the wealthiest, seven in 10 felt
little impact from the crash.
   The survey found a receptive audience for Republican
presidential nominee George Bush's theme of national prosperity,
with most expressing satisfaction with their family's income.

   The 100th Congress plans to adjourn this week
once it clears its desk of unfinished business including a
campaign-year attack in the war on drugs.
   The fate of dozens of bills lies in the balance as the House and
Senate begin what both sides agree will be the last week of the
two-year Congress. The biggest of the bills is a massive anti-drug
package passed by the Senate last Friday.
   The Senate bill isn't as tough on drug users as one passed
earlier by the House and negotiators from both bodies will be
meeting to try to resolve the differences. If they agree on a
single package, a final vote will be needed in the House and in the
Senate before it can go to President Reagan for enactment into law.

   The Communist Party's policy-setting
Central Committee opened today what is billed as a historic session
to approve the most sweeping personnel changes in the four decades
since the party came to power.
   The expected changes come as Yugoslavia experiences its worst
economic and social crisis in 43 years of communist rule. Amid
growing ethnic and social unrest, living standards have fallen by
one-half since 1980, and austerity measures adopted in May have
slashed salaries as prices rise. Inflation is at 217 percent and
the foreign debt stands at $21 billion.
   Striking workers have taken to the streets in increasing
numbers, prompting alarmed officials to seek permission from the
International Monetary Fund to relax the austerity program.
   Fourteen of the 23 members of the Communist party's ruling
Politburo could be up for replacement at the meeting, including
four senior leaders whose recent resignations will have to be
formally accepted at the meeting.

   With South African troops out of southern

   Guerrilla officers promise few prolonged battles of the kind
that UNITA and South African forces waged early this year in the
siege of Cuito Cuanavale.
   Angolan government units were temporarily driven out of the
southern town, they say. But, eight months later, UNITA is back in
defensive positions east of Cuito, awaiting an enemy campaign.
   The departure of several thousand South African soldiers seven
weeks ago, as part of regional peace negotiations, ``has weakened
our position,'' Savimbi said in a recent interview.

   Rescuers used chain saws to keep two small breathing holes open
in the six-inch thick Arctic Ocean ice, but freezing temperatures
threatened to close them. The whales became trapped nearly two
weeks ago while migrating south to warmer waters.
   The endangered California gray whales, about 24 to 30 feet long,
were bleeding and battered from continually bashing into the jagged
ice and were exhausted from swimming against the ocean current to
remain in place.
   ``They don't look as spry. Their movements are diminished,'' Ron
Morris of the National Marine Fisheries Service said Monday.

   A foot-long crack and 29 smaller cracks were
discovered by chance on a Continental Airlines Boeing 737 recently
in roughly the same area where a similar Aloha Airlines jet broke
apart in flight last April, officials said Monday.
   Metallurgists from the National Transportation Safety Board were
examining the 30-inch section of the aircraft where the cracks were
found along a ``lap joint,'' or section where the outer metal skin
overlaps, near a window of the first-class section.
   NTSB Chairman James Kolstad said the ``chilling discovery'' was
made by Continental workers Oct. 5 when they began stripping paint
from the 19-year-old Boeing 737 to prepare it for repainting.
   Kolstad in a speech delivered to an aviation group in Montreal
called the discovery ``frightening'' in part because the cracks
were found by chance and because they were ``in the same general
area'' where the Aloha plane broke apart.

   First Lady Nancy Reagan expressed regret
Monday that she failed to heed the advice of White House lawyers
that she formally disclose her borrowing of gowns and other
designer apparel. But her press secretary and a government ethics
spokesman said there was no legal requirement that she do so.
   Press Secetary Elaine Crispen acknowledged that Mrs. Reagan had
reported such loans when the issue first arose in November 1981,
saying the first lady then decided ``to err on the side'' of
compliance with the law.
   Since 1982, Mrs. Reagan has continued to borrow and return items
without reporting the transactions, Mrs. Crispen said, even though
White House lawyers originally had recommended disclosure as a
precautionary measure.
   ``Mrs. Reagan regrets that she failed to heed counsel's
advice,'' Mrs. Crispen said in a formal statement late Monday.
``Nevetheless, no reporting rules or laws were violated.''

   The pilot of a Uganda Airlines jet tried three times
to land in thick fog at Rome's main airport before the Boeing 707
crashed into houses and trees early Monday, killing 31 of the 52
people aboard, authorities reported.
   The fog and a reported possible ``misunderstanding'' between
pilot and control tower at Leonardo da Vinci Airport were suspected
factors in the crash.
   All 21 survivors were hospitalized, many in critical condition
with burns, fractures and shock. Only one of seven crew members, a
steward, survived.
   Wreckage was strewn for half a mile, but only one injury was
reported on the ground.
   Rome police headquarters spokesman Paolo Moscarelli said late
Monday that one passenger died in a hospital, raising the death
toll to 31.

   Lions stopped roaring as flames threatened a
shelter for abandoned exotic animals Monday, and a second blaze
headed toward ancient trees in Sequoia National Park as fires
burned more than 4,300 acres in California.
   ``If the wind picks up it could flare up into a 40-foot sheet of
fire and a fireball could roll over us without batting an eyelid,''
said Martine Colette, spokeswoman for Wildlife Way Station, the
animal shelter in Angeles National Forest's Placerita Canyon area
30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
   Several blazes, including a 1,000-acre fire burning near trees
up to 2,700 years old in Sequoia, erupted during the weekend when
California was blasted with temperatures near 100 degrees in some
areas and dry desert wind gusting to 30 mph.
   National Weather Service meteorologist Mark McKinley said
southern California will experience a cooling trend in the next
couple of days but, with 25-mph mountain wind conditions, wouldn't
change much for firefighters until Tuesday night or Wednesday
morning.

   Two 15-year-old boys despondent at
being separated when one of their families moved away took their
lives together during a weekend reunion, sharing a hunting rifle
that each fired at his own head, police said Monday.
   The bodies of the two _ Michael J. Kruczkowski of South
Milwaukee and William A. Bollis, who had recently moved to Malone _
were found Sunday evening by Kruczkowski's mother in the attic of
the boy's home.
   ``They were best of friends and they had been separated,''
Police Chief Erick A. Slamka said. ``One family moved to a rural
community. That's about it. The kid from up north had come down to
visit for the weekend, and it was when the father came to pick him
up that the bodies were discovered.''
   Both boys were killed by a single shot to the head, and the
wounds of both appeared to be self-inflicted, the chief said. The
evidence indicated Kruczkowski shot himself first.

   The United States and the Philippines
concluded an agreement Monday to guarantee U.S. military use of
strategic air and naval bases in the Southeast Asian country
through 1991 in exchange for $962 million in American aid.
   That represents an increase of $258 million in economic and
military assistance as part of a complicated arrangement that
permits the Philippines to use ``a substantial portion'' to reduce
its debt and bars American soldiers who test positive for AIDs fro
serving in the country.
   The successful conclusion of what at times had been difficult
negotiations could foreshadow extension of the U.S. military
presence in the strategic Asian nation beyond 1991, but the terms
will have to be negotiated between the two sides, probably
beginning next year.

   State officials Monday sought to retain
custody of 59 hungry children taken from a farmhouse where an
8-year-old girl allegedly was beaten to death by staff members of a
California religious center.
   The girl, the daughter of Ecclesia Athletic Association founder
Eldridge Broussard Jr., was taken to a fire station Friday by four
adults connected to Broussard's group. She was already dead.
   Dayna Lorea Broussard had been beaten and whipped severely,
state Medical Examiner Dr. Larry Lewman said.
   Some of the other children bore marks and scars, said Bart
Wilson, Clackamas County branch manager of the state Children's
Service Division, which planned to go to court Monday afternoon to
keep the children in state custody.
   ``We're led to believe that abuse had occurred,'' Wilson said.
``It's our recommendation that these children remain in protective
custody, at least for a period of time.''
   The children, ranging in age from 1{ months to 16 years, were
hungry and sleeping on pillows on the floor of the sparsely
furnished four-bedroom house, Wilson said. They were placed in
state juvenile centers and foster homes over the weekend.

<HEAD>`Accused' Seeks to Challenge Rape Stereotypes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inside a scruffy tavern called The Mill,
patrons sip beer, a boxing match flickers on television, a jukebox
plays and back in the game room, a group of men gang-rape a woman
atop a pinball machine while others cheer them on.
   In the new movie ``The Accused,'' it's just another wild night
out for the rapists and their chanting throng.
   ``The Accused,'' which chronicles the crusade of a rape victim
(Jodie Foster) to bring both her assaulters and their applauding
spectators to justice, shows in frank detail what rape is really
about.
   And for actress Kelly McGillis, who plays the prosecutor, the
movie had an even more personal note.
   ``I was raped by two men in my apartment in New York City in
1982, so for me it's far more than a movie,'' said McGillis, who
found that while watching the completed film was ``difficult,'' it
did address some important issues.
   The actress only recently began talking publicly about the
crime. In a recent interview with the New York Daily News, she said
she decided to speak out after attending a fund-raiser at a Los
Angeles rape treatment center. ``I was overwhelmed by the strength
of the women I met and thought that I had been a coward by not
speaking out myself,'' she said in the interview.
   McGillis was not the only person associated with the film who
had an intimate knowledge of rape and its aftermath. A former
girlfriend of Jonathan Kaplan, the movie's director, was gang-raped
for 12 hours in their apartment while Kaplan was out of town, he
said.
   ``Rape has almost become a right of initiation at fraternity
houses,'' said Sherry Lansing, who co-produced ``The Accused'' with
Stanley Jaffe.
   ``That's appalling. ... What I hope will happen is that no one
will everlook at a rape victim the same way again,'' Lansing said.
``No one will ever say, `She asked for it.'''
   Foster's character, Sarah Tobias, is a provocative and
foul-mouthed waitress who likes to have a good time. But the film
points out, as courts and women's groups have over the past few
years, that the Sarah Tobiases are just as much a victim as women
who are more demure and sheltered.
   ``The incredible thing about the rape scene in the movie is that
it isn't sexual,'' Foster said. ``It's about violating humanity,
and saying, `This isn't a person. This is like a piece of something
to serve my purposes.'''
   Hollywood has confronted rape before, and fairly graphically in
movies such as ``Lipstick'' and ``Extremities.''
   However, ``The Accused'' comes more directly from real life. It
is strongly reminiscent of a 1983 case in New Bedford, Mass., in
which a woman was gang-raped on a pool table at Big Dan's bar, as
several patrons either whooped encouragement or failed to
intervene. The tavern was in a section of New Bedford heavily
populated by Portuguese-Americans.
   Six men, all of Portuguese descent, were charged in the case.
Four were convicted and two were acquitted. Paramount Pictures,
responding to criticism from Portuguese-American groups who said
the movie will open old wounds, issued a disclaimer saying ``The
Accused'' was not based on the New Bedford incident.
   The movie, in part, focuses on the prosecution of the onlookers,
who are charged with criminal solicitation.
   ``The movie came about because I've wanted to do a movie about
the responsibility that you have as a bystander, a witness, and how
sometimes you're just as culpable when you watch something as when
you actually participate,'' Lansing said.
   To challenge the myth that women who say ``no'' actually mean
``yes,'' Sarah Tobias is brazen. That she chooses, on one evening
at The Mill, to be sexually aggressive and let her guard down does
not mean she wants men to do whatever they please.
   ``For a minute in her life she said, `I'm not going to feel
danger.' And she ends up paying the consequences for being herself,
and that's a really sad thing,'' Foster said.
   ``If I want to show that a woman always has the right to say no
_ no matter if she's drunk, or stoned, or sexy or whatever _ I have
to paint a character who, in the beginning, I want to dismiss,''
Lansing said. ``But by the time you see what happened, I don't
think anybody could walk out of that movie and think that girl
deserved to be raped.''
   Lansing said it would be wrong to consider this a message film.
   ``If you want to send a message, you go to Western Union,'' she
said. `First and foremost, you have to do a piece of entertainment
that people will enjoy. And then you slip your message in. The best
film entertains you, and then you walk out of the theater and start
to talk.''
   Said McGillis: ``I don't think a film can change a whole social
pattern. But I do hope that what this film will do is to inspire
people to start asking questions. That's the beginning of
education.''

<HEAD>Once-Homeless Rapper Returns After Partner's Slaying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York City _ the home of rap music and
rappers Run-DMC, Kool Moe Dee and LL Cool J _ is also home to more
murders each year than any other place in the nation: 1,691 last
year.
   Lawrence Krisna Parker _ aka rapper KRS-One _ learned a lot
about both in 1987. Parker, voice of the group Boogie Down
Productions, scored a successful debut album with ``Criminal
Minded'' just months before his music partner was gunned down by
two teen-agers during a Bronx street dispute.
   It was the latest twist in the strange tale of Parker's life, a
life in which he's lived in city subways, city shelters and a city
jail.
   ``Every little bit of negativity I was up against was grounds
for me to stay positive,'' Parker said in an interview during the
band's recent tour. ``It kept me alive.''
   Parker left his home in Brooklyn at age 13; he moved into the
borough's lush Prospect Park, sleeping outdoors in the summer and
in the subways when the temperatures dropped.
   He eventually entered the dangerous city shelter system; at one
point, a drug bust landed him in the Bronx House of Detention for
60 days.
   ``It was like a chopped-up situation _ from shelter to apartment
to shelter to street,'' said Parker. ``That whole period was from
age 15 to 20.''
   While residing at the Franklin Avenue shelter in the South
Bronx, he met counselor Scott Sterling, better known as DJ Scott
LaRock.
   ``I was the youngest client, he was the youngest social
worker,'' recalled Parker. ``It was like we were destined to hook
up.''
   It wasn't John Lennon meeting Paul McCartney at the Quarry
School for Boys in Liverpool, but it was enough to convince both
they had a future in music. They picked up several other residents
from shelters, and some other friends. Boogie Down Productions was
born.
   When ``Criminal Minded'' was released last year, they scored a
hit; despite very little radio support, it sold more than 300,000
copies.
   LaRock and Parker were heavily into preparing the follow-up when
the DJ was murdered on Aug. 26, 1987, after intervening in a
dispute over a woman. In May, two Bronx teen-agers were arrested
and charged in the slaying.
   Although Scott's violent death cast a pall over Parker and
company, the rapper says he did not consider quitting.
   ``Never. The thought never crossed my mind for a second,'' he
said. ``This album was already done before Scott passed away _ not
done on tape, done in our heads. I'm just carrying out an agreement
that me and Scott made.''
   Included on the second LP, ``By All Means Necessary,'' are two
cuts which decry the city's problems with the drug ``crack'' and
with crime: ``Stop The Violence'' and ``Illegal Business.'' The
problem, says Parker, is delivering the message without giving a
lecture.
   ``The approach is not to sound like their mother and father _
people don't want to hear that,'' he said. ``The approach is to
sound like their brother or their homeboy.''
   The approach is also to sound fresh, Parker added.
   ``Personally, I listen to the radio to know what not to sound
like,'' he said. ``I could run the list down for days of who not to
sound like. You could say everybody in the music industry at this
point except Gil Scott Heron.''

<HEAD>6th-Century Coffin Yields Evidence of Korean Cultural Influence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By K.P. HONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese archaeologists say a 6th-century stone
coffin opened in a previously untouched tomb contains dozens of
treasures showing a strong likelihood of Korean cultural influence
in Japan.
   A government research team lifted the two-ton lid off the
vermillion-colored coffin Oct. 8 at the Fujinoki Tumulus, or mound,
in Nara prefecture, the heartland of ancient Japan.
   Japanese newspapers and television have given the discovery
extensive coverage while the archaeologists carefully drain water
from the coffin to retrieve the encrusted articles.
   They say the treasures include at least three swords, a pair of
gilt-bronze shoes, a golden necklace, earrings, ornaments and other
accessories. The coffin also contains human bones and remnants of
cloth.
   Officials at Kashihara Archaeological Research Institute of Nara
prefecture, in western Japan, say recovery of the relics and
remains will take several weeks. The identity of the person buried
in the tomb is not known.
   Professor Kyoichi Arimitsu of Kyoto University, who directed the
Kashihara Institute in 1980-1984, said the relics were believed to
be from one of Korea's three ancient kingdoms _ Silla, Paekche or
Koguryo.
   ``They are similar to those found in tumuluses in the Korean
Peninsula,'' he said in a telephone interview after inspecting the
excavation.
   Kazu Uehara, a professor of art history at Seijo University in
Tokyo, agrees with Arimitsu.
   ``When a set of harness was found at the Fujinoki Tumulus three
years ago, some people disagreed with my view that it might have
come from Korea,'' he said. ``They said the harness looked more
like Chinese.
   ``The remains in the stone coffin, I believe, will correct their
theory. I know, of course, there are similarities between ancient
Chinese culture and that of Korea. However, they are not the same.
For instance, hexagonal ornaments extracted from the stone coffin
have been found only in Korean tumuluses.
   ``There are some Japanese scholars who would hesitate to accept
the fact that Japan received more cultural heritage from Korea than
China. ... The tendency, I believe, stems from an attitude of
looking down on a small country like Korea.''
   The tomb and mound date from the Yamato period, which ran from
early in the Christian era through 710.
   Yamato is the ancient name for mountainous Nara prefecture,
where the first unified state in Japan was based. Members of its
ruling class were buried in mounds.
   Japan and Korea made their first peaceful contacts during the
Yamato period and Japan began its long history of adopting and
adapting the cultures of others.
   Writing in Chinese characters was imported from Paekche in Korea
in 285. In the next 300 years, through contacts with Korea, the
Japanese learned of the formidable and advanced culture of the
Asian mainland.
   Arimitsu said the Fujinoki mound was believed to have been
created between 551 and 575. It is about 600 yards from the
Buddhist temple Horyuji, built between 601 and 607 in the town of
Ikaruga, 8 miles southwest of Nara.
   Excavation of the mound, which is 30 feet high, began in 1985.
About 3,500 relics have been found, including exquisite gold and
bronze objects, in addition to the stone coffin.
   Archaeologists viewed the coffin's interior in June, using a
flexible instrument with a lens on the end, and set up a
chain-and-pulley mechanism to raise the heavy, peaked cover.

   Skull and Bones, the oldest and most
secret senior society at Yale University, boasts many distinguished
alumni but none more prominent today than a ``spook'' from the
class of 1948 _ George Herbert Walker Bush.
   Little is known about the strange rituals and practices of the
156-year-old society, and that's the way its members want it. The
rites are rumored to include placing initiates in a coffin and
requiring them to plunge naked into a pile of mud.
   Some of the rumors come from rival societies, and may be
suspect. No one but members really know what goes on inside the
windowless, mausoleum-style structure of brown sandstone to which
Bonesmen retreat.
   But as the Republican presidential nominee's own experience has
shown, membership in the society forms powerful bonds of friendship
that endure long after graduation.
   The vice president was one of 15 Yale juniors tapped for Skull
and Bones in 1947. To this day, the Bonesmen who once heard him
recount some of the innermost secrets of his life remain his good
friends.
   Perhaps because of the pledge of secrecy that Bonesmen take,
Bush did not mention his Skull and Bones membership in his
autobiography, ``Looking Forward.''
   The society has long been suspected of ritualistic thefts. A
group of history buffs in El Paso, Texas, claimed that the skull
referred to in the society's name belongs to Mexican revolutionary
Pancho Villa, whose grave was robbed in 1926.
   Endicott Davison, a lawyer who says he speaks for Skull and
Bones, said the society does not have the skull.
   The former chairman of the San Carlos Apache tribe in Arizona
charged recently that Bush's father, Prescott Bush, stole the skull
of Apache chief Geronimo years ago, and that it is still on display
at Skull and Bones' inner sanctum. That claim was denied by the
vice president's brother, Jonathan Bush.
   One thing is not disputed: Bush the Bonesman is in powerful
company.
   Brothers of the order have included Henry Stimson, Averell
Harriman, Henry Luce, Potter Stewart, McGeorge Bundy, Archibald
MacLeish, William F. Buckley Jr. and William Sloan Coffin Jr.
   Prescott Bush, a Republican senator from Connecticut, was a
member. So was Bush's oldest son, George W. Bush, and about a
half-dozen other family members.
   Skull and Bones is arguably the most famous and influential
secret society in the United States, having served as a model for
others that followed at Yale and other institutions.
   It was founded by William Russell, a member of the Yale Class of
1833, apparently in reaction to the stripping of secrecy from Phi
Beta Kappa, the honorary scholastic society, during the rise of a
national anti-secrecy movement.
   Skull and Bones is a private organization incorporated as the
Russell Trust Association. It pays taxes to the city of New Haven
and owns Deer Island, a resort on the St. Lawrence River.
   Giving Skull and Bones the benefit of the doubt, Brooks Mather
Kelly, in a 1974 history of Yale, wrote of the society: ``Its
purpose and programs were not revealed when it was founded and have
never since been known. But that like most Yale societies it
pretends to some intellectual and educational purpose can probably
be assumed.''
   The society ``comes from a tradition of elitism of which Yale
was at the center,'' said Dan A. Oren, author of ``Joining The
Club,'' a book published in 1985 about the relationship between the
university and Jews.
   Skull and Bones became the first of the secret societies to
admit a Jew in 1937. During the 1960s, the society tapped a number
of outspoken radicals. Even today, however, it remains steadfastly
all-male. Of Yale's seven secret undergraduate societies, only one
other _ Wolf's Head _ refuses to admit women.
   Having women as members would interfere with one of the ways
Bonesmen become true brothers. By all accounts, Skull and Bones
initiates must lay bare their souls, telling their sexual histories
and life stories in graphic detail.
   ``The danger of secret societies and entering into the club
world is it allows members to lose sight of the common folk who
aren't part of the elite,'' Oren said. But he said that Bush's
experiences in World War II combat worked the other way.
   ``For so many veterans, their fight was against the racists and
the bigoted values of Nazi Germany, so when they came back, they
were embued with a strong sense of egalitarianism,'' Oren said.
   Bush, 21 and already married, entered Yale in 1945 after his
discharge from the Navy, which awarded him the Distinguished Flying
Cross and three Air Medals for his wartime exploits. While on one
combat mission, Bush's plane was shot down and he was rescued by a
submarine. Two fellow crewmen perished.
   Bush recounted his brush with death for Bonesmen in 1947 with
great emotion, says former Rep. Thomas W.L. Ashley, D-Ohio, another
member of the Bones class of 1948.
   ``What comes to mind was, he was an awful young guy who had had
an idyllic kind of childhood who suddenly found himself in an
airplane that was on fire facing a lot of death around him and
almost certain death himself,'' Ashley said.
   Ashley and other Bonesmen in his Yale class are still close
friends of Bush. ``Obviously, we became fond of each other,''
Ashley said. ``This was something kind of special to us.''
   He added: ``George Bush is exactly just as loyal to other
friends as those who happened to be in the society with him. His
friendship across the social range is known to everyone.''
   Members of the Bones class of 1948 came to Washington in 1981
for a reunion that included dinner at the vice president's mansion
and a tour of the White House Oval Office.
   ``His having been a member of Skull and Bones and his continued
involvement as an alumnus means he would probably be likely to draw
upon past connections for the White House,'' Oren said.
   ``But his choice of people _ James Baker III to be campaign
manager, Dan Quayle as vice president _ shows he's willing to go
beyond Yale,'' Oren said.
   ``He has always maintained close connections to Skull and Bones,
but his world certainly goes beyond New Haven.''

<HEAD>Paul Winchell Brings Cartoon `Tiggrrrrer' To Life</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ventriloquist Paul Winchell asks, `How do you
spell Tigger?'' and slips into a voice fitting for a cartoon tiger:
`` T-I-double grrrr-E-R.''
   Winchell, during an interview, frequently demonstrates the range
of cartoon voices he does for Disney and Hanna Barbera.
   But there are faint echoes across the executive dining room atop
the animation building at the Disney Studios. You hear a ``Quack,
Quack!'' here and a ``Quack, Quack!'' there. Other people at other
tables are also doing cartoon voices.
   For a moment you feel you've wandered into the Ink and Paint
Club in ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?''
   For the last 20 years, Winchell has been the voice of Tigger,
the zany tiger in the animated versions of A.A. Milne's beloved
``Winnie the Pooh.'' The first effort, ``Winnie the Pooh and the
Blustery Day,'' won an Academy Award as best animated movie short
in 1968. It has now become a Saturday morning series on ABC as
``The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.''
   Winchell, in fact, does voices for two other Saturday morning
shows: Disney's ``Gummi Bears'' and Hanna Barbera's ``The Smurfs.''
He's also done voices for such movies as Disney's ``Aristocats''
and ``The Fox and the Hound.''
   Until he began working on cartoons, Winchell was better known as
a ventriloquist and the man behind dummies Jerry Mahoney and
Knucklehead Smith. His dummies are now at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington.
   At the age of 13 he was a winner on radio's ``Amateur Hour'' for
doing his imitation of Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy.
Ventriloquist Bergen was his childhood hero, and Winchell said one
of the greatest thrills of his life was a joint appearance with
Bergen on the game show ``Masquerade Party.''
   ``We appeared as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,'' he said. ``After we
unmasked, we picked up each other's dummies. I did Charlie
McCarthy, and he did Jerry Mahoney. It was a magic moment.''
   Winchell made his television debut in 1947 and within a year was
host of ``The Bigelow Show.'' He was also host of a number of
children's shows, including ``The Paul Winchell-Jerry Mahoney
Show'' and ``Circus Time.''
   ``I first met Walt Disney 25 or 30 years ago,'' he recalled.
``He said, `We're both in the same business. I use cartoons and you
use dummies and we both entertain children.' That was long before I
started working here. Walt gave me a VIP tour of the studio. I
remember people doing voices. I said, `Gee, that must be fun.' And
here I am.
   ``Ventriloquism today is in a slump. Children today haven't been
exposed to it. Edgar Bergen was an enormous hit in radio. But I
think television defeats ventriloquism. Children are so used to
seeing puppets that when they see a real ventriloquist they don't
understand it. On television, everyone talks and they don't care
about the mechanics.''
   Winchell, white-haired at 66, suffered a heart attack two years
ago. ``My cardiologist said I could still do voices,'' he said,
``but to avoid working with the rest of the cast to avoid the
stress. The studio's been very nice to me. I can come in, do my
voices alone. I was able to do some of them in a recording studio
in Miami when I was visiting there.''
   He said when he does a voice he likes to create an entire
character. ``Many people do different voices, but the basic rhythm
is always the same,'' he said. ``I try to do more than just using a
falsetto or pitching my voice. I always look for little
distinctions in each voice. Little characteristics or
idiosyncrasies.
   ``Tigger, for instance, has a little lisp and a little laugh. My
wife is British and has a lot of sayings that I throw in. She'll
say, `TTFN. Ta-ta for now.' So Tigger will say that and laugh. It
gives a character more dimension.''
   Winchell is writing an autobiographical novel, which he jokingly
calls ``Dummy Dearest.'' It's actually called ``The Strange Saga of
Jimmy Flood'' and will closely parallel his own career and life.

fun can result in carelessness on their part. Grown-ups need to be
aware of this and be ready to compensate.
   Jack-o-Lanterns containing candles, for example, should be kept
away from landings and doorsteps where long flowing costumes could
come in contact with the flames, warns the federal Consumer Product
Safety Commission.
   Indoors, make sure that these lanterns are away from curtains,
decorations and furnishings that could be ignited.
   Homes welcoming the visits of costumed youngsters should display
a light, and residents ought to pick up things like garden hoses
and lawn ornaments that could trip children.
   Parents, the Safety Commission says, should tell their offspring
to go only to homes where a welcoming light is on.
   And they should be warned never to enter the home or apartment
of a stranger. Setting a specific time for them to be home can be a
good idea.
   When shopping for costumes, look for ones labeled flame
resistant, the commission says. This doesn't mean the product won't
burn, but at least it will resist ignition, and will extinguish
easily if a fire starts.
   Flimsy skirts and costumes with big, baggy sleeves should be
avoided because of the danger of contact with fire.
   Make costumes short enough to avoid tripping, and dress
youngsters in shoes that fit _ mom's high heels can be a hazard to
youngsters, the National Safety Council warns.
   Make costumes light and bright enough to be easily visible to
motorists. Decorating or trimming the costume with reflective tape
can be a big help.
   These reflective tapes can be seen by drivers even when
traveling at high speeds, the American Optometric Association
reports.
   Bags intended for goodies can also be decorated with reflective
tape, and children should also carry flashlights to help them see
and be seen.
   The commission urges using natural masks of cosmetics rather
than buying the child a plastic or cardboard mask which can
obstruct vision and even restrict breathing.
   Swords, knives and similar costume accessories should be soft
and flexible.
   Warn children not to eat any of the treats before they get home
and then examine all the items carefully before allowing them to be
eaten.
   Be especially wary of treats that are not wrapped in original
wrappers. In many areas local hospitals offer to X-ray Halloween
treats and some local police departments have programs too.
   Small children should be accompanied by an adult on their rounds
and all youngsters should be warned against running out from
between cars or across lawns, where ornaments, furniture or
clotheslines may prove dangerous to them.
   Adult drivers need to be aware of the large numbers of children
who will be out and need to watch for them in the streets or
darting out unexpectedly. Be especially wary when pulling into
driveways and alleys.
   And finally, bring in your pets on Halloween night, urges the
Humane Society of the United States.
   Black cats seem to be particularly subject to cruelty on this
evening, and even dogs in their own yards aren't safe from
thoughtless or cruel people, the society warns. Keep pets inside or
on a secure leash if walking them.
   Dogs or cats frightened by the sight of costumed children may
also bite or scratch, the society warns, and keeping the pet away
from the holiday confusion can prevent these problems.
   And remember, pets are like children in one way, letting them
consume candy, gum and cookies can lead to an upset stomach.

<TEXT>
   Sidney Rittenberg came to China as a young
idealist and his reward was 16 years in prison. Now he helps other
foreigners find keys to the doors of commerce in his adopted land.
   Rittenberg, 67, is president of Kamsky and Rittenberg, a
consulting firm that helps foreign clients, most of their American,
get information and access to Chinese officials.
   Since establishing the firm a year ago, Rittenberg has found
markets and Chinese partners for U.S. makers of gas turbines,
pencils, jeans and electrical appliances, and guided them through
the enigmatic world of Chinese contract negotiations.
   He has organized tours for such as evangelist Billy Graham and
Gov. Ray Mabus of Mississippi, sometimes acting as interpreter in
impeccable Mandarin at meetings with senior Chinese leaders.
   ``I like the feeling that we're building little bridges,'' he
said in an interview.
   Rittenberg began building his bridges decades ago, with some
disastrous consequences. He is a native of Charleston, S.C., and
first came to China in 1945, as a U.S. Army interpreter after
studying Chinese at Stanford.
   Like other young American liberals caught up in the turbulence,
Rittenberg was attracted by the zeal and idealism of Mao Tse-tung's
revolutionaries.
   ``I was taken with the idea they were going to build a new kind
of just, democratic socialist society,'' he said. After leaving the
Army he decided to stay in China, at the urging of Chou En-lai and
other leaders, to help establish an English-language radio service.
   When Chinese authorities put him in the back of a truck going to
Beijing in 1949, he thought he was being enlisted to help negotiate
relations between the United States and Mao's new Communist
government. ``I was euphoric,'' he said.
   Instead, Rittenberg was imprisoned on charges of being an
American spy.
   He learned later that Soviet dictator Josef Stalin demanded his
arrest, claiming Rittenberg was an accomplice of American
journalist Anna Louise Strong, who had been arrested in Moscow for
spying. She and Rittenberg were collaborating on a biography of Mao.
   Six years in prison followed, the first of them in an unlighted
room with black cloth over the windows.
   When he was released and cleared of wrongdoing in 1955, ``Mao
apologized to me,'' he said. ``They really felt bad about it and
took me into the family.''
   Back at Radio Beijing, he was made privy to material seldom
revealed to outsiders. ``That was power, access to inside
information,'' he said in the interview.
   His world collapsed once more during the Cultural Revolution of
1966-76.
   Again he was deceived. He said he thought the Cultural
Revolution, with which Mao dislodged the entrenched bureaucracy,
``was a great day, a kind of town hall democracy.''
   But the radical leftists who gained power revived the old spying
charges and jailed him in 1968. He spent 10 years in solitary and
his Chinese wife, Yulin, was sentenced to three years in a labor
camp.
   ``There was only one real issue, keeping your sanity from day to
day,'' he said of the lost decade. ``I tried not to be bitter. In
solitary, bitterness is the enemy. But who are you going to be sore
at? It was the whole system.''
   He said he felt freedom was near when he heard Mao's widow,
Jiang Qing, yelling from a nearby cell. Jiang, who Rittenberg says
personally prolonged his prison term, was arrested in late 1976 as
ringleader of the notorious ``Gang of Four.''
   Again released and again exonerated, he was given a sinecure
with the Academy of Social Sciences, helping arrange academic
exchanges. In 1979 he returned to the United States for the first
time in 34 years.
   Rittenberg now spends about half the year in the United States.
His consulting firm has an office in New York and he has a home in
Seattle, where one of his four children also lives.
   His hope that Chinese communism would be ``different from the
Russians, more civilized and democratic,'' dissolved long ago.
   ``Mao went back on his promises,'' he said, and if the
democratic socialism he once envisioned for China ever comes, ``it
will be nothing resembling Marxist-Leninist societies so far.''
   After so many years away, Rittenberg said, he finds the United
States to be a more humane country.
   ``The leaders of the Chinese revolution didn't understand that
if not everyone is protected by law then no one is,'' he said.
``Our forefathers were smart enough to build that into the system.''
   Rittenberg worries about corruption in China, where young people
``have no 10 Commandments and no Communist ideology'' and party
officials are among the greediest. He said there are ``thieves
galore built into the system,'' but believes a ``kind of
self-correcting mechanism'' will see China through.
   China and the United States ``have a special chemistry and
there's no reason it shouldn't cement and grow,'' Rittenberg said.
``I feel kind of good it is happening now.''

<HEAD>Ellen Malcolm: Filling the Smoke-Filled Vacuum for Women
Candidates</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Election-Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Bolstered by a personal fortune worth
millions, Ellen Malcolm is on her way to becoming a force in the
Democratic Party, a power-broker with the clout to make and break
candidates.
   Forget the men in smoke-filled rooms. Malcolm is a new breed of
wheeler-dealer, driven by a conviction that society will be a
better place if more women are elected to high office.
   To that end, Malcolm four years ago created Emily's List, a
political action committee that funnels money to select women
candidates around the country.
   Malcolm has three criteria for her list. Candidates must be
Democrats, support the Equal Rights Amendment and endorse a
pro-choice stand on abortion.
   ``When you're on Emily's List, that really means something,''
said Malcolm, 41, a tall, straight-talking woman with few pretenses
and a relaxed manner.
   Usually what it means is enough money, early on, for a candidate
to run a viable campaign through the general election.
   ``Emily's List was absolutely crucial to my campaign,'' said
Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., one of the two women in the Senate.
   Peggy Connally, spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, said it is a ``tremendous boost'' to be placed
on the list. ``They are willing to come out early and endorse; most
national groups are reluctant to make an early endorsement.''
   Malcolm came up with the name Emily's List to underscore her
commitment to backing candidates early in a race. The name Emily
stand for ``Early Money Is Like Yeast'' _ it makes the dough rise.
   In 1986, Emily's List endorsed only two candidates, Mikulski and
Harriet Woods, who lost her bid for the Missouri Senate seat.
   This year, nine women _ all House candidates running in open
seats or trying to oust incumbents _ have been recommended as
beneficiaries of more than $500,000 collected from list members.
   Emily's List differs from many political action committees in
the way it distributes money. PACs are restricted from giving more
than $5,000 in the primary and $5,000 in the general to any
candidate.
   Emily's List recommends women and then asks people to write
checks to the candidate of choice. Emily's List processes the
checks and distributes them.
   The practice, called ``bundling,'' allows a candidate to collect
unlimited funds from a number of invididuals, each of whom can give
no more than $1,000 in the primary and the general election. About
2,000 people contribute to candidates on Emily's List.
   A committed Democrat, Malcolm worked in a variety of public
interest jobs before she founded Emily's List. She was an organizer
for Common Cause, the public interest lobby, and served as press
secretary for the National Women's Political Caucus.
   Malcolm's wealth springs from her multi-million dollar
inheritance from her great-grandfather, a founder of IBM. She
serves as a volunteer, giving Emily's List a maximum allowable
contribution of $25,000 annually.
   A graduate of Hollins College, Malcolm holds a degree in
experimental psychology and a business degree from George
Washington University.
   One political development that disconcerts Malcolm is the
failure of Democratic women to move more quickly into high
positions. Republican women, many of them moderates, have made
faster gains in modern day politics.
   ``The reason Republican woman are moving up quickly is that the
party helps recruit women,'' providing them with needed financial
support early in their careers, she said.
   Ann Stone, a fund-raiser for Republican candidates, thinks there
are other reasons why more GOP women get elected, even though more
women run as Democrats.
   ``Polling data shows that Democrats have a problem being seen as
competent and Republicans have a problem being seen as
passionate,'' she said. That perception helps Republican women
because they are easily able to counter the notion they are
unfeeling.

<HEAD>Radical Students Take Over National University</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Centrists run the national
administration and rightists dominate the legislature, but the
radical left has gained control of El Salvador's leading university
during nine years of civil war.
   Portraits of Che Guevara and Farabundo Marti, the revolutionist
for whom the Marxist-led guerrilla army is named, gaze from campus
walls at students moving between classes at the University of El
Salvador.
   ``Long live the people up in arms!'' is written across the
School of Humanities facade. Leftist folk songs boom over the
public address system.
   Conservative groups in El Salvador, a nation of 5.5 million
paople about the size of Massachusetts, say the 35,000-member
student body has become a fifth column of subversives.
   Some students, teachers and alumni contend, however, that
radical student unions do not represent the majority.
   Like nearly all national universities in Latin America, El
Salvador's is financed by the state but remains autonomous. The
government has virtually nothing to do with its administration.
   Police and soldiers are forbidden by law from entering the
grounds, but that did not prevent a military-dominated regime from
invading the school in 1980 and shutting it down for four years.
   When President Jose Napoleon Duarte, a Christian Democrat,
visited the campus last year to inspect damage done by a severe
earthquake, catcalls and shouted insults drowned out his attempts
to speak.
   ``If we examine the institutions that identify with the needs
and aspirations of the Salvadoran people, we find they are all
politicized because we are in the middle of a war,'' said Luis
Argueta Antillon, a leftist economist who is the university's
rector.
   ``These institutions cannot withdraw themselves from that war.
No one can remain neutral,'' he told an interviewer in his office.
   A conservative alumni group alleged in paid announcements
published last month that ``the standard bearers of terrorism'' had
taken over the student body with the object of ``fomenting social
disorder.''
   Student unions use demonstrations for increased government
spending on education as a pretext for ``acts of terrorism'' in the
streets, the ads said.
   Among about 3,000 students in a march for more funds Sept. 13
were 200 with bandannas over their faces, carrying iron staves or
nail-studded wooden clubs. The military says some masked marchers
are guerrilla ``urban commandos.''
   That march ended in a melee of tear gas and flailing clubs when
300 riot troopers moved in on the demonstrators. The driver of a
police truck was killed, allegedly shot by a marcher.
   About 250 people were arrested and 14 charged with subversive
affiliation. All eventually were released for lack of evidence.
   Argueta said security forces frustrated at release by the courts
of people they consider subversive might resort to kidnapping and
murder to quell student action.
   Two young men carrying books entered a university cafeteria Oct.
3, walked up to custodian Raul Escamilla, drew pistols and shot him
to death. A university statement called the killing ``part of a
government and military campaign against the university.''
   Escamilla, 34, was arrested by the National Police and held for
several days last year on suspicion of affiliation with the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   Eli Ruiz, a journalism professor, worries about the effect of
radical activism on academic standards.
   ``The effort to keep classes from politicizing is constant,''
Ruiz said, and he tries to teach according to ``scientific''
criteria, ``but because of the context of conflict that is very
difficult.''
   The rector, Arqueta, contends ``We cannot think in terms of
academic level for its own sake.''
   He said medical school graduates had enjoyed success in North
America and Europe, a testament to their training, ``but the fact
we turned out good doctors did not lower our infant mortality rate
or provide better conditions of public health or increase life
expectancy.''
   Argueta is presiding over a revision of the rules to require
that future graduates contribute 500 hours of ``social service'' in
their fields.
   Asked why no centrist or rightist student union had been formed,
he noted that 75 percent of students were from families of workers
or peasants while ``the expressions of the center and the right are
minority expressions.''
   ``Realizing they are in the minority, they don't want to get
into an open confrontation of ideas,'' he said of students from the
political center and right.
   One student, speaking privately, said conservatives on campus
are intimidated by the radical ``minority.''
   ``When they come into a lecture hall and announce that class is
suspended for a march or a sit-in, maybe three or four out of 80
take part in the activity,'' she said.
   Many conservative students express their opinions on lavatory
walls. A tour turned up condemnations of the guerrillas and leftist
student unions, generally unprintable, and ``Vivas'' for Ronald
Reagan and Roberto d'Aubuisson.
   D'Aubuisson leads the rightist Arena party, which won control of
the legislature this year, and is said to have headed rightist
death squads accused of killing thousands of alleged leftists in
the early 1980s.

   Here is a list of key congressional races in
which women candidates are raising strong challenges. Also listed
are races in which women incumbents are facing stiff challenges.
   
   WISCONSIN: Susan Engeleiter, 36, a Republican state senator with
a law degree from the University of Wisconsin, is trailing Democrat
Herb Kohl in the race to succeed retiring Sen. William Proxmire, a
Democrat known for his shoe-string campaigns. Internal polls by
both campaigns show Engeleiter about 10 points behind, but she is
seeking to capitalize on her experience in state economic matters.
Kohl, 52, a wealthy businessman and owner of the Milwaukee Bucks,
is a political novice. Using his own money, Kohl is expected to
spend up to $7 million compared with Engeleiter's $3 million.
   
   CALIFORNIA: Anna Eschoo, a Democratic San Mateo County
supervisor, is making a strong showing in her bid to fill the House
seat of Rep. Ernest Konnyu, a one-term Republican who was the only
representative to lose in a primary. Tom Campbell, a political
newcomer who teaches law at Stanford University, defeated Konnyu in
the primary. Polls show a close race.
   
   COLORADO: Martha Ezzard, a former Republican state senator who
switched parties last year, is challenging incumbent Dan Schaefer
in a district that includes the Denver suburbs. The environment is
an issue.
   
   IDAHO: Jeanne Givens, a Democratic state legislator, would be
the first native American women in Congress if she unseats
incumbent Larry Craig, a four-term incumbent. Givens has traveled
the length of the state's first district in a bus to solicit votes.
   
   LOUISIANA: Faye Williams, a Democratic lawyer, is in a rematch
with Rep. Clyde Holloway, a one-term Republican. Williams would
become the first black woman elected in Louisiana if she unseats
Holloway in the 8th district race. Black registration in the
district is about 36 percent. Williams, who has strong support from
Democratic stalwarts, was hurt in her 1986 race by revelations that
her estranged husband had beat Williams and shot to death the man
she had been dating in 1971.
   
   MARYLAND: First-term Republican Constance Morella is facing a
challenge from Peter Franchot, a member of the Maryland
legislature, in Montgomery County, a wealthy suburb of Washington.
Morella is a moderate Republican who narrowly won a formerly
Democratic seat in 1986.
   
   MICHIGAN: Lana Pollack, a state senator, is trying to oust Rep.
Carl Pursell, a six-term Republican incumbent in the 2nd district.
The disparate district includes Ann Arbor, the home of the
University of Michigan, as well as the Detroit suburbs.
   
   NEW YORK: Nita Lowey, former New York assistant secretary of
state, faces incumbent Rep. Joseph DioGuardi, a Republican, in
heavily populated suburban Westchester County outside New York
City. DioGuardi, an accountant, was first elected by the 20th
District in 1986.
   
   NEW YORK: Rosemary Pooler, a former public service commissioner,
is running a strong race in the 27th district to succeed Rep.
George C. Wortley, a Republican who is retiring. Facing Pooler is
James Walsh, a council member from Syracuse. The district is
halfway between Albany and Buffalo.
   
   NEW YORK: Rep. Louise Slaughter, a Democrat from the 30th
district, was the only woman to defeat an incumbent in 1986. She is
facing John C. Bouchard of Rochester in the race to keep her seat
in what has traditionally been a Republican district.
   
   SOUTH CAROLINA: Rep. Liz Patterson, a first-term incumbent
Democrat, has a tough fight to keep her seat in the 4th District
where Republicans are strong. Her opponent is Knox White, a city
councilman from Greenville who has patterned his positions after
those of Vice President George Bush.
   
   WASHINGTON: Jolene Unsoeld, a Democratic state legislator, is
favored to win the seat vacated by Rep. Don Bonker, a Democrat.
Unsoeld faces Bill Wight, a former aide to Republican Sen. John
Warner of Virginia. Unsoeld, an avid environmentalist and a
mountain climber, lost her husband and her daughter in separate
mountain climbing accidents.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The government of Brazil this month announced an
environmental plan aimed primarily at slowing the uncontrolled
burning of the Amazon jungle by farmers and ranchers, a practice
which among other things has aggravated the worldwide ``greenhouse
effect.'' Here is a report on the slash-and-burn land clearing that
has destroyed 240,000 square miles of rain forest in the past 10
years.
</TEXT>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTO VELHO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acrid smoke rises two miles high from
the slash-and-burn fires ravaging the Amazon rain forest as peasant
farmers and big cattle ranchers alike try to tame the jungle for
food and profit.
   With tens of thousands of square miles of lush green vegetation
put to the torch each year, many scientists and environmentalists
view it as an ecological disaster, not only destroying the forest
but poisoning the earth's atmosphere.
   The World Bank has estimated that since 1978 this type of land
clearing has destroyed 240,000 square miles of rain forest cover,
an area larger than California.
   ``At this rate, the Amazon jungle could become an immense desert
within 100 years,'' says Alberto Setzer, an environmental engineer
with the Brazilian government's Space Research Institute.
   Further, a report by the institute said the amount of smoke from
the burnings is 1,000 times more than that emitted by the 1982
eruption of Mexico's El Chichon volcano, which caused ``serious
alterations in the chemical composition of the earth's atmosphere.''
   Critics charge that Brazil has allowed haphazard and destructive
settlement of the Amazon Basin, which covers an area roughly
two-thirds the size of the continental United States and
encompasses 30 percent of the world's tropical rain forests.
   Saying he was alerted by the disclosure that scientists had
found more than 6,000 man-made fires in the Amazon in a single day,
President Jose Sarney on Oct. 12 announced a new
environmental-protection program.
   The program, called ``Our Nature,'' calls for a temporary end to
government tax and financing benefits for large-scale cattle
ranching in the northern Amazon and a ban on exports of unprocessed
tropical timber.
   ``We must create nationwide consciousness that we are all
passengers in the adventure of Man on Earth,'' Sarney said in
announcing the program. ``The era of unlimited natural resources is
over.''
   The ``Our Nature'' program also contains a recommendation to
Brazil's Congress to cut mercury imports. Free-lance gold
prospectors throughout the Amazon use the highly toxic element to
separate gold from river silt and then throw the waste into the
water.
   ``This program is going to shake up powerful economic
interests,'' said Antonio Jose Guimaraes, president of Brazil's
federal Forest Service. ``But the government is resolved to carry
it out.''
   Earlier laws designed to colonize and develop the poor Amazon
Basin permitted land developers to burn off 50 percent of their
properties _ the fastest and cheapest way to open up clear areas _
and then gave them tax deductions for doing so.
   Brazil already had some environmental-protection laws in place,
but because of the country's vast size, deteriorating economic
situation and scarcity of real enforcement power, the laws were
largely ignored.
   Scientists at the Space Research Institute say that jungle fires
last year released nearly 500 million tons of carbonic gases into
the atmosphere, making Brazil one of the chief contributors to the
``greenhouse effect'' that is dangerously warming the earth's
climate.
   Scientific studies warn that rising global temperatures could
eventually cause the inundation of major U.S. and European coastal
cities and the parching of prime heartland farm areas in North
America, Europe and the Soviet Union.
   In Porto Velho, capital of the jungle state of Rondonia in far
western Brazil, Compton Tucker, a physical scientist with the U.S.
space agency, said the burnings in the Amazon were responsible for
10 percent of the carbon dioxide existing in the earth's atmosphere
today. Carbon dioxide is ``the major greenhouse gas,'' he said.
   The fires in Brazil also are responsible for large quantities of
carbon monoxide, methane and nitrogen oxides, scientists say.
   Tucker works for NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in
Greenbelt, Md., and his main task is to trace emissions in the
atmosphere from tropical forest burnings.
   The state with the largest percentage of its Amazon forest cover
destroyed by fire is Rondonia, roughly the size of Oregon, which
has become a mecca for hundreds of thousands of down-and-out
peasant farmers and free-lance gold prospectors, along with some
big-scale farmers and ranchers.
   Luiz Alberto Catanhede, Rondonia director of the Brazilian
Forest Service, says than 26,000 square miles of jungle, or close
to 28 percent of the state's territory, has been burned over the
past 13 years.
   During the May-to-October dry season, the burning Amazon casts a
cloud of smoke over Porto Velho, partially blocking out the sun.
Drivers have to switch on their headlights during the day, and the
airport is frequently shut down because of lack of visibility.

   Marcos da Costa Pereira, a physicist with the space institute,
says, ``The burning of the Amazon is not only poisoning the
atmosphere and affecting the earth's ozone layer, it is also
reducing the rain forest's capacity to produce oxygen.''
   He says that although it is an exaggeration to call the Amazon
the ``lungs of the world,'' a phrase often found in press accounts,
the Brazilian jungle is a ``major contributor of the oxygen
breathed by mankind.''
   Along BR364, the 900-mile asphalt highway that slices through
the jungle to connect Porto Velho to Cuiaba, capital of the state
of Mato Grosso, the charred and still smoldering remains of once
majestic Brazil nut, rubber and brazilwood trees stand in mute
testimony to man's destructiveness.
   Along the highway, homesteaders, their faces blackened by trees
turned to charcoal, struggle to clear their land and plant crops
such as rice, corn and cassava before the rains come.
   Raimundo Nonato de Souza, 50, owns 123 acres of land about 60
miles outside Porto Velho. He burned about 50 acres to plant
cassava, a tropical root that yields a coarse flour and serves as
``bread'' for impoverished peasants.
   During a break from work, he wipes perspiration from his brow
with his forearm and says, ``This is the second time I have burned
this plot. Next year, nothing will grow on it, and I will have to
burn some more of my land.''
   Neither Souza, his 38-year-old wife, Raimunda, nor their two
young children have any idea what the greenhouse effect is all
about. But, expressing a kind of instinctive concern, the Brazilian
says, ``I know it's wrong to burn the jungle, but I have no other
choice. I have no money to buy a tractor, which would let me clear
the land without burning it.''
   Souza, like thousands of other homesteaders, received his plot
free of charge from the government. ``But before I could receive
title to my land, I was told I had to clear it off, and the best,
cheapest and fastest way to do so was to slash and burn.''
   Another peasant farmer, Oscar Fernandes, 48, asks, ``Where am I
supposed to grow the food to feed my family? On top of the trees?
If I don't cut down the forest and burn it, I will starve.''
   Catanhede, of the Brazilian Forest Service, says the worst
offenders are the owners of large cattle ranches who ``burn more
and more land each year to create pastureland to feed their growing
herds.
   ``After two or three burnings the land is completely depleted of
all its nutrients. Nothing will grow on it. The farmer then slashes
and burns some more virgin forest to continue growing crops, and
the cattle raiser does the same to get more pastureland.''
   The Forest Service tries to control the burnings by issuing
special licenses and setting limits on how much can be burned on a
given property.
   Penalties for burning without a license are fines equivalent to
$725 dollars per acre affected and prison sentences of up to one
year.
   But the law is widely flouted. Debt-ridden Brazil doesn't have
enough forest rangers or policemen to make the rules stick, and,
besides, most of the jungle burners couldn't afford the fines
anyway.
   ``What we would really like is to be able to enforce the law
that says a property owner must reforest the area he has
destroyed,'' Catanhede says. ``But with only 15 forest guards to
keep an eye over more than 90,000 rural properties in the entire
state and with no funds to increase our manpower, controlling the
burnings becomes an impossible task.''
   Francisco de Assis Araujo, head of Rondonia's Environmental
Protection Agency, says his office has been trying to educate
farmers to plant perennial crops such as coffee, cacao, and rubber,
mango and orange trees.
   ``The land would have to be slashed and burned only once to grow
such crops and thus repeated burnings and further destruction would
be avoided,'' he says.
   But homesteaders like Souza and Fernandes, who have little or no
education and who emigrated from other parts of Brazil where their
lives were even more wretched than in Rondonia, say they never
received any instructions or guidance from the government.
   Araujo says the Rondonia state government was about to implement
an ``agro-ecological zoning plan'' to specify which areas were
ecologically suitable for different agricultural activities and
cattle raising, thereby protecting, theoretically, the jungle from
unnecessary destruction.
   But he says Brazil's federal government, facing political
opposition because of a record 800 percent annual inflation rate,
views efforts to educate farmers about the proper use of the soil
as ``superfluous expenditures which just increase the public
deficit.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The magazine hit the newsstands at a time when
movies such as ``Platoon'' and ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' and TV
series such as ``China Beach'' and ``Tour of Duty'' were finding an
eager audience. But the success of Vietnam magazine surprised even
the publishers themselves. ``All of a sudden there is almost a

   As its circulation nears 250,000 after only
three issues, Vietnam magazine is receiving poems from Boat People
and letters from kids wanting to know more about the war Dad at
last is beginning to talk about.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if we started hearing from old Viet
Cong cadre telling how they got ready for Tet,'' says Harry
Summers, a retired Army colonel and twice-wounded Vietnam veteran
who edits the magazine.
   ``We never know where our readers are, there's such renewed
interest in Vietnam everywhere. We've had letters from Korea and
Australia. Nippon TV just did a feature on us.''
   Gregg Oehler, the 31-year publisher of Vietnam, was in the 6th
grade when the evening TV news showed the Tet battle for the U.S.
Embassy in Saigon. Vietnam has fascinated him ever since, but he
had no idea that the quarterly he launched in March almost on a
whim would attract such a readership. By January it will become a
bimonthly and expand from 68 to 84 pages, 32 in full color.
   ``The beer and tobacco advertisers are knocking on the door,''
Oehler says. ``They don't usually bother with anything under a
half-million circulation. It's incredible. The first issue drew
3,000 letters. We touched a sensitive public nerve that had been
long suppressed and it exploded. In my wildest dreams I never
thought we'd reach sales of 100,000 in two years.''
   The magazine hit the newsstands at a time when movies such as
``Platoon'' and ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' and TV series such as
``China Beach'' and ``Tour of Duty'' were finding an eager audience.
   ``All of a sudden there is almost a nostalgia for Vietnam. The
vets are breaking out their faded jungle fatigues and boonie hats
to march in Veterans Day parades. We get letters recalling how
beautiful the beaches were and asking about tours back to Nam,''
says Summers. ``Our mail and reader surveys show that their wives,
widows and kids want to learn more about our least-understood war.''
   Summers served as an infantry officer in War Zone D and then
returned to negotiate with the North Vietnamese. He was evacuated
by helicopter from the roof of the U.S. Embassy when Saigon fell.
   ``Our aim is to tell what happened, not why, as accurately and
dispassionately as possible, without glory or gore. This is not
`Rambo' or `Soldier of Fortune','' adds Summers, who has taught at
the Army War College, authored several textbooks on military
tactics and writes a syndicated column on military affairs.
   The average age of Vietnam veterans is now 41, and this baby
boom generation is beginning to examine its youth.
   Executive Editor C. Brian Kelly credits the Vietnam Memorial
with ``encouraging the 2,594,000 veterans who did a tour in Vietnam
to come out of hiding, rejoin the mainstream and claim the pride
that is their due. The memorial has become both their Wailing Wall
and the place to meet up with old buddies.''
   Since its dedication on Veterans Day 1982, the memorial has
become second only to the White House as a magnet for visitors to
Washington.
   The gradual but growing visibility of Vietnam veterans 15 years
after the last American units ``stood down'' in Southeast Asia is
reflected in the ranks of the American Legion, which now counts
800,000 of them in its 2.3 million membership.
   This August, for the first time, several hundred Vietnam
veterans turned up in Washington for the annual convention of the
Society of the First Infantry Division. There are 77 Vietnam
veterans in Congress.

<TEXT>
   Empire Press, which publishes Vietnam magazine, specializes in
historical publications. It publishes seven other magazines _
including World War II, American Civil War, Age of Napoleon and
Great Battles _ from a quaint colonial building in the historic
district of Leesburg, Va.
   Kelly points out that ``a 12- to 15-year lag in books and
articles also occurred after the Civil War, which tore apart the
country even more than Vietnam did.'' Gen. William T. Sherman
published his memoirs in 1875, but it was 1881 before Jefferson
Davis wrote his ``Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government'' and
Ulysses S. Grant's memoirs didn't appear until 1884.
   In telling the what, rather than the why, of the war, early
issues of Vietnam gave graphic accounts of MIG vs. Phantom
dogfights over North Vietnam, the battle for Song Be in the Mekong
Delta, and B-52 raids on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Other articles
looked back at ``The Pentagon East,'' the command complex at
Saigon's Tan Son Nhut airbase, the huge American-built port at Cam
Ranh Bay now crowded with Soviet warships, and French historian
Bernard Fall, who was killed in a mine explosion along Route 1, his
``La Rue Sans Joie'' _ street without joy.
   ``This war was fought on so many different levels, from lonely
jungle outposts and huge bomber bases to tunnel rats and gunboat
crews on the Mekong, that there is real hunger among our readers to
find out what the other guys were doing there and how it all fitted
together,'' Oehler says. ``Also we know from the mail there is a
lot of interest in the 7,500 women who served in Vietnam and their
effect on the expanding role of the female in modern warfare.''
   Advertisements at the back of the magazine show a growing market
for Vietnam videotapes, insignia, authentic fatigues, infrared
goggles and military watches, and a lively competition among
collectors of battlefield souvenirs such as Viet Cong bamboo
canteens and helmets, authentic ``calico noir'' _ or black pajamas
_ even pungi stakes, clay grenades and other guerrilla weaponry.
   Upcoming issues include a look at how Australian forces operated
on jungle patrols, an interview with Neil Sheehan about his
biography of Vietnam guru John Paul Vann, and a step-by-step
recounting of how Army surgeons operating behind a wall of sandbags
removed a live grenade from a GI's back.
   ``We have no shortage of manuscripts,'' Summers says. ``And
almost every week somebody offers us 1,000 or so pictures he took
out there. We're always willing to have a look, but we stay away
from the grisly stuff.''
   Despite the continuing avalanche of both, Vietnam does not print
poems or letters to the editor. ``But we may review our policy
there,'' the editor says. ``A lot of poignant poetry comes from
Vietnamese refugees.''
   Try as it might to avoid controversy, the magazine wandered into
a politcal mine field while Congress was considering a bill to move
the starting date of the undeclared Vietnam War back to Feb. 28,
1961, so more veterans could receive education and pension
benefits. Eligibility now dates from Aug. 5, 1964, when President
Lyndon Johnson told Congress U.S. destroyers had been attacked in
the Gulf of Tonkin.
   The Vietnam Memorial commences its long gray granite line of the
dead in 1959. Vietnam magazine, in its second issue, moved the date
of ``America's first Vietnam casualty'' all the way back to Sept.
26, 1945 with an account of the assassination ``by Communist
bullets'' of OSS Maj. A Peter Dewey, who was on a mission ``to
locate 214 Americans at two Japanese POW camps in the Saigon area.''
   Controversies of this sort, Oehler says, ``show how much mystery
and confusion still shroud the Vietnam War. If we can shed any
valid historic light on any area of this enigma that still baffles
the national conscience, the magazine will be worthy of the
interest it has generated among a generation that has been so sadly
ignored.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It was less than a decade ago that a federal
judge in Michigan ruled that women in prison were not being
afforded education, employment and legal services equivalent to
those for men. Since then many prisons have instituted reforms, but
not without prodding. Here's what happened at a women's prison in
Pennsylvania.

   Women convicted of even minor felonies often
enjoy fewer privileges behind bars than men serving time for murder
or rape, prison reform advocates say.
   ``Women prisoners' concerns do not get the priority men's do,''
says Ed Koren, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties
Union's National Prison Project. ``If they're thought about at all,
they're way down the list. They don't complain about it, so
correctional people are not really required to do anything about
it.''
   The numbers may be one reason. Only about 5 percent of the state
and federal prisoners nationwide are women.
   But buoyed by some court rulings in recent years, female
prisoners are beginning to see some changes.
   In 1983, for example, women at the State Correctional
Institution at Muncy wanted a law clinic, a privilege established
long ago in men's prisons. Officials denied the request, leading
Sharon Wiggins and four other inmates to file a class-action
lawsuit in U.S. District Court.
   The suit also alleged that vocational, educational, medical,
rehabilitation and psychological services at Muncy were inferior to
those at prisons for men. They also claimed exposure to fire
hazards and asbestos endangered their safety.
   ``We decided that maybe it was time to take a look at not only
the legal situation, but a lot of other things that we were
concerned about _ education, the medical department, the way we
were placed in jobs,'' says Miss Wiggins, who is serving a life
term for killing a man during a bank robbery.
   Prison reform advocates say the claims are similar to those
involving women's prisons in many states.
   In the landmark Glover vs. Johnson case in Michigan, U.S.
District Judge John Feikens in 1979 ruled that education,
employment and legal services for women prisoners were inferior to
those for men. He later ordered a series of improvements in those
programs and the creation of a trust fund to benefit female
prisoners.
   The federal General Accounting Office in 1980 warned that such
suits would increase as long as female offenders did not have
facilities, training or services equivalent to those for male
offenders.
   Reform advocates say advances have been made as the number of
women in state and federal prisons has doubled during the 1980s.
   ``The number increase will ironically increase the numbers of
programs,'' says Martha Stone, legal director of the Connecticut
Civil Liberties Union.
   Charlene Snow, an attorney for the plaintiffs in the Glover vs.
Johnson case, said, ``My sense is that the Glover decisions have
enabled complainants in other states to use the language of the
judge and the decisions to bring suits and get things settled.''
   At Muncy, Miss Wiggins said, the inmates felt rejection of the
law clinic was the last straw.
   ``I decided that it was just time for me to either stand up and
be heard or stop complaining and never doing anything about it,''
she said.
   The lawsuit has not come to trial. But attorneys for both sides
say many of the inmates' complaints have been resolved. They now
have access to a legal program, a drug and alcohol treatment
counselor, a mental health clinic and strengthened vocational and
eductional programs.
   ``Unquestionably, a number of the changes that were made are a
direct result of this litigation,'' said Susan Cary Nicholas,
managing attorney of the Philadelphia-based Women's Law Project,
which is co-counsel for the plaintiffs along with Thomas Place, a
professor at the Dickinson School of Law.
   Muncy, nestled in the lush farmland of the Susquehanna Valley,
today is a prison of stone cottages where inmates can grow
vegetables and play softball with teams from nearby towns. They
also can qualify as paralegals and learn house painting,
upholstery, computers and auto mechanics.
   Muncy administrators speak of a window of opportunity to change
the lives of inmates, most of whom are mothers and will leave
prison after less than five years.
   ``They need to be able to leave prison with something in their
bag of tricks besides themselves,'' says Superintendent Ann M.
Goolsby.
   The path often starts with basic education, and inmates who need
it can receive one-on-one tutoring from the staff, outside
volunteers and other inmates.
   The prison was established in 1920 as the State Industrial Home
at Muncy. It was Pennsylvania's only state prison for women until
July 1, 1984, when a minimum-security women's prison opened at
Waynesburg. Eleven housing units and 10 other buildings are
clustered on Muncy's 62-acre campus.

   Mrs. Goolsby estimates that 70 percent of the 525 inmates were
imprisoned for drug-related crimes. They range in age from 18 to
69, with most between 25 and 39. Eighty are lifers. Six are men.
   ``The history of Muncy is very typical of women's prisons,'' Ms.
Nicholas says. ``It was built at a time when it was fashionable to
believe that the appropriate treatment of women offenders and
juvenile offenders was to send them far out into the countryside to
obtain fresh air and good healthy work and to remove them from the
corrupting influences of the city.''
   Muncy's setting in rural Lycoming County is within a short drive
of the Federal Correctional Institution at Lewisburg and the
Allenwood Federal Prison Camp, but it's a four- to five-hour drive
from Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, where most of Muncy's inmates
come from.
   The distance became a sex-discrimination issue in the lawsuit,
because many men's prisons are closer to major cities where
families can visit more easily.
   ``You cannot travel to Muncy by public transportation for
visiting hours,'' Ms. Nicholas says. ``This is absolutely
devastating to women who need to maintain contact with their kids.''
   A $4,000 contract with the Salvation Army to provide
transportation for children and care-givers is awaiting prison
approval, says Steve Jacobsen, president of Project IM-PACT (Inside
Muncy-Parents and Children Together), a new program that provides a
homelike setting for inmates to meet with children inside the
prison.
   Apprenticeships, following the example set in federal prisons,
were started at Muncy in 1979. Inmates can qualify for a license in
upholstery, caning and refinishing furniture, auto mechanics, food
services and building construction and maintenance.
   Elsie Denison, who promoted prison apprenticeships before
retiring from the Women's Bureau of the U.S. Labor Department, says
Muncy had an exemplary program that not only offered good training
but helped inmates find jobs or further training once they left
prison.
   Two job-placement specialists travel around the state looking
for jobs that would be suitable for inmates completing their terms
and helping them make the adjustment.
   The prison this fall will open a power sewing factory which will
be part of the prison system's Correctional Industries, allowing
inmates to earn a bonus while learning skills that could help them
find jobs outside prison.
   The suit's complaint that women with psychiatric problems
received inadequate treatment has been resolved with the temporary
conversion of one cottage into state-certified mental health
clinic. An $840,000 mental health addition to the prison infirmary
is awaiting an architect.
   The lawsuit's complaints about fire safety and asbestos have met
with divergent fates.
   ``Prisoners at Muncy are housed in buildings with antiquated
cell-lock systems, requiring that each of 40 to 45 cells be
unlocked by hand by the guard on duty in the event of fire or other
emergency,'' the suit stated.
   A $1.89 million project to install an electronic locking system,
fire detectors, emergency exits and lighting was completed Sept.
25, 1986, says Kenneth G. Robinson, press secretary for the
Department of Corrections. The project was part of a systemwide
improvement in the prisons' Life Safety Code, he said.
   Still unresolved is the presence of asbestos, a mineral fiber
once widely used in building products but now associated with
certain types of cancer.
   Two inspectors hired by the plaintiffs in October 1987 found
asbestos-containing materials throughout the institution. Jerry
Roseman and Lynne Lamstein of Occupational Health Consultation
Services Inc. in Bethlehem said in their report that prison
maintenance workers had tried to remove and repair the materials
without proper training.
   On March 8, nearly three months after the inspectors' report was
sent to state attorneys, two inmates and two staff maintenance
workers were asked to work above and around crumbling asbestos from
pipes, according to a court motion filed in April.
   Robinson says the department now has contracted with Lancaster
Laboratories of Lancaster to review the extent of the asbestos
problem.
   Miss Wiggins, interviewed in the formal conference room of the
prison administration building, said the suit has not endeared her
to all inmates.
   ``There are those inmates who feel, and maybe rightly so, that
we shouldn't make such a fuss,'' she says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He's called ``the grand old man of
birdwatching,'' a James Audubon of the 20th century. It's been more
than 50 years since Roger Tory Peterson published his guidebook for
birdwatchers, but it's still considered the bible of birding. And
at age 80 he's still going strong, promoting environmental causes
at every opportunity.

   Roger Tory Peterson, artist and bird
lover, started a ``revolution'' 60 years ago in the hilly meadows
and woods surrounding this small city in upstate New York.
   A walk in the woods hasn't been the same since.
   It was here that Peterson found the inspiration for an epic
work, ``A Field Guide to the Birds,'' a book that revolutionized
nature study. It took ornithology out of the laboratory and made
the feathered, fanciful world of the treetops more accessible to
the common man.
   Peterson's guidebook is found in more than three million homes
and libraries and is considered one of the main reasons 60 million
Americans take an interest in birds.
   More important to Peterson, it has increased people's awareness
of the environment, which he says was his underlying goal.
   ``Birding, afterformance. During curtain calls,
the entire cast showered Crawford with red roses. They were
assisted by members of the audience, some of them running down the
aisles of the Majestic Theater to toss flowers on the stage.
   An emotional Crawford spoke to the theatergoers, choking on what
he said was the same thing he told his mother on his 21st birthday.
   ``I'd like to thank you for having me,'' he told the cheering
crowd.
   ``You're perfection,'' yelled one enthusiastic woman.
   But Crawford has not hung up his ``Phantom'' mask and put away
his makeup for good. The actor plans to do at least a nine-month
engagement, beginning next May, in the Los Angeles company of
``Phantom.'' It's the best possible audition for the movies.
   ``The film people are there, and they'd see it,'' he says. ``I
have got very strong interest and offers from two studios. If I'm
in Los Angeles, I can work on development as it is happening.''
   Crawford has made movies before. Film buffs know him from ``The
Knack,'' ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,''
``Hello, Dolly!'' and ``How I Won the War.'' But this is the first
time a movie will be planned around him. What a difference a hit
musical can make to a career.
   ``I don't think I was known over here at all,'' Crawford says.
In England, he was a star. He appeared in several hit British
television series and had done three big musicals in London's West
End _ ``Billy,'' ``Flowers for Algernon'' and ``Barnum.'' The last
show, an American musical, had an even longer run in England than
it did in the United States.
   ``It ran so long we had births and deaths in the audience,''
Crawford says. ``People died, and we had a woman give birth once.
It was like life aboard a 747 on an around-the-world trip.''
   ``Phantom'' _ with the help of exposure on national television
shows such as ``West 57th Street'' _ has made his face familiar to
fans in the United States.
   ``When I first opened in `Phantom' in New York even the stage
managers would ask, `Are you Michael Crawford?,''' he says. Before
he left the show, there were crowds of 50 to 60 people waiting each
night at the stage door to see him.
   And the letters never stopped coming. Every day he would receive
more than 100 letters, some from overseas and addressed simply,
``Michael Crawford, Broadway, U.S.A.''
   Crawford's most dedicated followers have been an informal group
of Britishers called the OGRES, which stands for Opera Ghosts
Return Enthusiasts. Many of them came to New York for his final
Broadway appearance. Some had been here twice before, unfurling
banners down the Majestic alleyway that proclaimed ``Bring Him
Home.''
   ``There are about 25 of them and they won't let anyone else
join,'' he says. ``They are very exclusive. And if anyone
misbehaves, they are out. Or if they bother me. They don't like to
annoy me. They are very good to me.''
   Crawford also has widened his appeal with his first solo
recording, ``Songs From the Stage and Screen'' that he made before
he opened ``Phantom'' in New York.
   ``They have sold over 200,000 copies on the East Coast, so it's
on its way to gold,'' he says. ``And I'm very pleased. There was a
terrific amount of care gone into that record.''
   The album, which includes a medley of songs from ``West Side
Story'' and such Broadway classics as ``If I Loved You,''
``Memory'' and ``You'll Never Walk Alone,'' has sold well all over
the world.
   ``It's triple platinum in New Zealand, which means it has sold
20,000 copies,'' Crawford says. ``Even the sheep are buying it.''
   Crawford will go back into the recording studio early next year
in London to record a second album, this time a collection of love
songs. He hopes to include ``Music of the Night,'' his big number
from ``Phantom,'' if composer Andrew Lloyd Webber grants his
permission.
   The performer also is considering several new Broadway musicals,
although none he can talk about. ``But it's nice that I've been
asked,'' he says. ``And one of them is of particular interest to
me.''
   After ``Phantom'' closed, Crawford flew to Australia to make a
documentary film for a British charity. Then he may begin to relax
for a few weeks.
   Crawford admits he'll miss the hoopla that accompanied his
10-month ``Phantom'' run in New York, although there are tradeoffs.
   ``I'll be glad to have it quiet after all that attention,'' he
says. ``You need that quiet whenever you have finished a show that
is an event.''

<HEAD>Freed Prisoner Says Glasnost Has Not Improved Labor Camps</HEAD>

   Mart Niklus was awestruck when speakers
at a conference blessed by the Kremlin made the same statements
that had landed him in prison, but he said the new freedom had not
penetrated Soviet labor camps.
   Niklus, a dissident for decades who was freed July 8, heard two
days of speeches as a guest delegate to an officially sanctioned
meeting of the People's Front, an Estonian nationalist group.
   ``A lot has changed,'' he said. ``People have become less afraid
of publicity. They criticize the authorities boldly.
   ``People are more frank, open-hearted. National
self-consciousness has become very strong. It's surprising for me.''
   Niklus agreed that fewer people are going to jail for political
reasons, but also said the reform program President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev calls perestroika had not eased the misery of those
already there.
   ``There have been no changes. Perestroika hasn't reached the
correctional labor camps,'' he said.
   For Niklus, the memories of arrests and prison are too vivid to
permit complete belief in Gorbachev's reforms. He still holds his
hand over his mouth when speaking of politically sensitive matters.
   As a reminder to all, the 54-year-old former inmate wore the
black-and-gray striped uniform of ``special regime'' prisoners like
himself who are repeat offenders or considered especially dangerous.
   Speakers at the conference Oct. 1-2 in Tallinn's city hall urged
Moscow to renounce Josef Stalin's pact with the Nazis under which
the Soviet Union took control of independent Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania in 1940.
   ``I was sentenced for that. ... I got 10 years for that,''
Niklus said in the excellent English he learned while studying
ornithology before he was sent to prison.
   He and 47 other activists signed an appeal on the 40th
anniversary of the agreement, Aug. 23, 1979, demanding its
renunciation. He was arrested in April 1980 on charges of
``anti-Soviet propaganda and agitation'' and sentenced to 10 years
in prison and five in internal exile.
   It was Niklus' fourth arrest. He spent eight years in jail in
the 1960s.
   Now even the Estonian Communist Party is calling for a review of
Stalin's foreign and domestic policies.
   The party also has taken up some of nationalist demands: making
Estonian the official language, gaining local control over the
republic's economy and curbing immigration of non-Estonians.
   As a ``special regime'' prisoner, Niklus spent most of his time
in solitary. He was hospitalized for a month after his release,
being treated for chronic back pain that developed because he was
forced to sit for long periods and poor eyesight he said resulted
from confinement in a small, dark cell.
   To illustrate the decline of his health, Niklus displayed two
photographs _ one taken in 1976, before his latest imprisonment, in
which he had a full head of black hair and full cheeks; the other
taken after his release in July, showing a man with gray, thin hair
and sunken cheeks.
   ``You are not treated as a human'' in special regime, he said.
   Niklus described the standard diet was thin gruel, bread and
weak tea with sugar for breakfast; cabbage soup, bread and oatmeal
for lunch, except for Sunday when the main course was macaroni, and
hot water and a small piece of fish in the evening.
   Those meager rations may improve, however. On July 25, the
Soviet parliament directed that rations for prisoners in solitary
confinement or special regime no longer be reduced.
   Western estimates put the number of Soviet labor camps at more
than 1,000 and say they hold at least 1 million people, perhaps
twice that.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, says
about 200 people now are in labor camps, psychiatric hospitals or
internal exile because of political beliefs, compared with 10,000 a
few years ago.
   Soviet officials say all but a few people classified in the West
as political prisoners were freed by amnesties in February and June
1987. They say the ``anti-Soviet propanganda and agitation'' law
under which they and Niklus were convicted is being softened in a
revision of the criminal code.
   Perhaps, but Niklus said: ``They may arrest me again now. I have
been arrested four times. You never know when they will get you
again.''
   Then he added, with a slight chuckle: ``But I am not afraid. I
have a kind of immunity.''

<HEAD>Gigantic Tunnel Project Inches Toward Joining England and France</HEAD>

   A colossal tunneling machine
is boring beneath the English Channel from the white cliffs of
Dover, pursuing a dream born in Napoleon's time that is coming true
at last.
   Another is digging from the French coast in what the tunnel
builders call the largest civil engineering project now under way
in the world.
   The 31-mile tunnel, 24 miles of it underwater, will cut the
London-Paris journey from six hours to three, as fast as a
scheduled airline.
   It will enable freight to travel on one train instead of being
shifted to trucks for a cross-channel ferry trip subject to weather
and shipping strikes.
   Tunneling speed at the Dover end is less than 15 feet an hour
and the machine boring from the geologically more complex French
end moves even slower, which is why the tunnel will not open until
1993.
   For continental Europeans, accustomed to long-distance rail
travel, the tunnel is but a small spur on a vast network stretching
to Moscow and beyond.
   For the British, the change wrought by what many call the
``chunnel'' will be enormous. Some wonder whether Britain will be
ready for it.
   ``People still question whether the tunnel will be complete in
May 1993 and that's ridiculous,'' says Kathy Watson, co-author of a
book on the project. ``They're still arguing about whether it will
introduce rabies into this country, or let in terrorists.''
   ``They discuss it in terms of their being an island race, with a
channel that has kept out invaders,'' she said in an interview.
   State-owned British Rail will not commit itself to building a
high-speed link from London to the tunnel in time to make the
three-hour journey a reality in 1993. It intends instead to improve
existing tracks.
   Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French consortium that will own the
tunnel, is urging British Rail to speed its plans. Critics say the
tangle of commuter lines in southeast England, so obsolete that
trains can be delayed by a sudden fall of autumn leaves, will delay
tunnel traffic.
   The consortium forecasts 16.5 million passengers in 1993 but the
railroad says that figure will not be reached before 1998.
   Arriving channel trains will terminate at Waterloo station in
south London, at a large customs and immigration terminal. Critics
say this will waste time and Britain should follow the continental
practice of handling such matters on the train during the journey.
   British stations, bridges and tunnels are not built for the tall
loads commonly carried across the channel. That means many loads
will have to be repacked or transferred to trucks unless the
facilities are rebuilt.
   The grandiose project has been on and off the drawing boards for
more than 200 years.
   Napoleon wanted to bore a tunnel in 1802 but Britain's generals
warned him off. Digging began in 1882 but was halted by British
fears of French invasion through the tunnel.
   Britain's entry into the European Economic Community engendered
a spirit of unity and the digging began again in 1974, but two
years later a new British government shelved the project.
   With trade barriers among the 12 EEC countries set to fall in
1992, Colin Kirkland, technical director of Eurotunnel's on the
British side, says the tunnel will be completed this time.
   He says the entire cost of 5.2 billion pound ($8.8 billion)
project is privately financed and cancellation would cost the
governments ``enormous penalties'' to shareholders.
   Also, the governments signed a tunnel treaty in February 1986
and both would have to agree to cancellation.
   ``There's no way that politicians will cancel this project,''
Kirkland said in an interview. ``It's quite difficult to get one
government to agree. To get two is bloody nigh impossible.''
   Money's power to move the tunnel forward was demonstrated in
August, when drilling fell behind schedule.
   Eurotunnel ordered a management shakeup and threatened
Trans-Manche Link, the consortium of 10 British and French
engineering companies building the tunnel, with penalties of $25
million if the diggers did not pass the three-mile mark by Nov. 1.
   From a a rate of 380 feet a week, the pace quickly accelerated
and recently achieved a week's record of 480 feet, Kirkland said.
The timetable calls for 650 feet a week and Kirkland is confident
of reaching it.
   The tunnel, 80-130 feet below the seabed, was 2 miles into the
channel from this end Oct. 9, the most recent measurement
available, and the French had progressed about 1,300 feet. Digging
began last December.
   At its peak, the project will employ about 11,000 workers and 11
tunneling machines.
   Construction of the two one-way train tunnels begins in
December. A smaller service tunnel running between them now is
being dug.
   Tunneling machines simultaneously dig, remove rock and put up
tunnel walls. With a laser beam to keep the driver on course, the
700-foot-long behemoth creeps along, pressing curved slabs of
Scottish granite and pulverized ash into the newly exposed tunnel
wall.
   In an emergency like flooding, the cylindrical head of the
machine can expand to become a cork, blocking off the water and
spraying concrete into the cavity to seal the leak. Once the
all-clear is given, the two-story-high rotating blade with its
tungsten teeth resumes chewing ahead.
   Because the machines are too large to be removed, when the
digging is complete they will be rolled aside and walled in.
   The tunnels are to be completed in 1991, then the railroad
tracks will be laid. Eurotunnel will run shuttle trains once every
three minutes at peak times between terminals near Folkestone and
Calais, and British Rail and the Frenh state railroad will operate
trains from London and Paris.
   Cars and trucks will drive onto the shuttle trains and be able
to stay in their vehicles or stroll about during the 35-minute
tunnel passage.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Clara's Heart,'' ``Imagine: John Lennon''</HEAD>

   ``Clara's Heart''
   
   Clara Mayfield is a brutally direct woman who colors her human
relationships with a good deal of common sense, self-righteousness
and tenacity. She also has an overwhelming humanity about her, and
that specialness attracts people to her like a magnet.
   The relationship she forges with young David Hart is bound to be
a memorable screen joining.
   Clara is a vibrant and rich role, one that could easily turn
around Whoopi Goldberg's dismal film career. After such losers as
``Burglar,''``Jumpin' Jack Flash'' and ``Fatal Beauty,'' in which
the stand-up comic was required to do little more than imitate
Eddie Murphy and be the Butterfly McQueen of the 1980s, Goldberg
finally has a chance to demonstrate her talents as a dramatic
actress.
   Robert Mulligan (``To Kill a Mockingbird,''``Inside Daisy
Clover'') restrains Goldberg in his direction of this family
melodrama, allowing none of the bits and business that have become
the trademarks of her wealth of comic stage characters. That
restraint is essential to Clara herself, a Jamaican with a dark
secret.
   Clara enters the lives of the affluent Hart family from
Maryland's Eastern Shore, shortly after the crib death of their
daughter. Leona (Kathleen Quinlan) and Bill (MichaelOntkean) have
gone to Jamaica to help get over the tragedy. Clara is their hotel
maid.
   She coaxes Leona out of her depression and encourages her to get
on with life. Leona decides to bring her back to Maryland _ she
can't quite function without Clara's island sensibilities. But son
David Hart takes an immediate dislike to Clara and accuses his
parents _ rightfully so _ of bringing her home so they won't have
to deal with him.
   The Harts are in the process of a divorce. He has taken up with
a hot cutie, and she has taken up with a pretentious bore of a pop
shrink (Spalding Gray).
   Clara eventually wins over David to the point where he'd rather
spend his weekends in Baltimore with Clara and her West Indian
friends than with his parents. He also picks up Clara's island
patois, to the delight of her friends.
   But David's dependency on Clara ultimately leads to her dark
revelation. And it is here that the movie falters. There is no
build-up to this awful experience in her life, and its unfolding is
an abrupt twist. And with the tale, there remain loose ends:
Letters hidden in a suitcase and found by David are never
explained; the father of Clara's child also is a mystery.
   Still, ``Clara's Heart'' is a warm movie with many lessons to
tell, if one is willing to listen. Its force is aided by Goldberg's
performance and a noteworthy movie debut of Neil Patrick Harris as
David.
   The Warner Bros. release of an MTM Entertainment Production
features a lilting score by Dave Grusin. But Hollywood has yet to
learn through its endless quest for authenticity that steel music
and calypso are products of Trinidad, not Jamaica, where reggae and
soca bloom.
   Martin Elfand produced ``Clara's Heart,'' which is rated PG-13.

   ``Imagine: John Lennon''
   
   Rarely has a 20th-century phenomenon been so thoroughly
chronicled in every conceivable way as the Beatles.
   Yet the new documentary ``Imagine: John Lennon'' provides
previously unseen material on the most enigmatic of the Beatles, if
not any fresh insights.
   Yoko Ono, Lennon's ever-protective widow, released 200 hours of
tapes and films from their private collection to documentary and
miniseries producer David L. Wolper (``The Making of the President:
1960,''``Roots''). Wolper and producer-director Andrew Solt culled
through the material and also searched for newsreels and TV
appearances.
   The documentary material was combined with new interviews with
Yoko Ono and Lennon's first wife, Cynthia, sons Julian and Sean,
and various associates of Lennon. None of the three surviving
Beatles was interviewed.
   ``Imagine'' provides a gold mine for Beatle lovers and
especially those who revere Lennon, who was slain outside his
apartment in Manhattan by a crazed fan in 1980.
   But the film provides marginal entertainment for the average
moviegoer. Documentaries are never easy to endure in a theater.
``Imagine'' is no exception, despite the great skill that went into
its making.
   There are some riveting moments. The most scarifying comes when
John and Yoko encounter cartoonist Al Capp (``L'il Abner'') during
the Montreal Bed-in for Peace, a meeting as deadly in its way as a
mongoose's minuet with two cobras.
   The Lennons' penchant for shock is demonstrated in a nude
love-making scene which was filmed two weeks before he died,
intended for a music video. It is antiseptically graphic, hardly
erotic at all.
   Director Solt has capably maintained the kind of pace
established in the trend-setting Beatles feature ``A Hard Day's
Night.'' Only in the final sequence does the film falter. Lennon's
murder and the outpouring of grief from his candle-holding fans is
protracted into a kind of deification that hardly suits the subject.
   There is commentary by family and friends, and Lennon's own
voice narrates much of ``Imagine.'' Whether he was excessively
narcissistic or merely had a exceptional sense of history,
posterity should be grateful for his extensive record-keeping. How
valuable it would be to have such records of James Dean, Marilyn
Monroe, Elvis Presley and other icons.
   The Warner Bros. release was co-produced by Sam Egan and written
by Egan and Solt. Rated R for nudity and language. Running time:
103 minutes.

   ``Talk Is Cheap'' (Island) _ Keith Richards
   
   If Mick Jagger's solo records are Jagger without the Rolling
Stones, conversely, and somewhat symmetrically, Keith Richards'
first solo effort is the Stones without Jagger.
   Richards isn't much of a singer, but he manages a listenable
rasp on a series of tunes that wouldn't exactly tax Caruso. This is
a tough rock musicians' record, anyway, starting with Richards'
patented take-no-prisoners guitar backed by a stellar cast of
studio musicians, including Bernie Worrell on organ, Waddy Wachtel
and Mick Taylor (former Stone) on guitars, Bobby Keys and Macco
Parker on various saxes, plus the Memphis Horns.
   Charley Drayton is on bass most of the time, Steve Jordan drums
and Ivan Neville keyboards. Sarah Dash sings background. Patti
Scialfa (E Street Band and the Boss' main squeeze) is on one cut.
   All the songs were co-written by Richards and Jordan.
   ``Take It Hard'' and ``Struggle'' are especially worth blasting
loud enough to enrage the neighbors.
   Richards makes a mistake on ``Make No Mistake'' with his
impersonation of Peggy Lee on steroids. Dash comes in to save it,
though, giving Richards a Tom Waits-like charm by comparison. They
team again on the wonderfully soulful ``Rockawhile.''
   ``Locked Away'' is a real pretty tune. Richards should hire
someone else to sing it. By the last cut, ``It Means a Lot,'' it
seems Richards-Jordan had run out of ideas.
   But the closer of Side 1, ``You Don't Move Me,'' is another
four-star effort that could apply to anyone you know who needs a
verbal thrashing but here, it was obviously meant for Jagger: ``You
lost the feeling, got so appealing. Why do you think you think you
got no friends? You drove 'em all 'round the bend. Ah, yeah, you
don't move me anymore. ... It's no longer funny, it's bigger than
money, you just don't move me anymore.''
   As the record says, ``Talk Is Cheap,'' so you better be able to
move 'em yourself. And most of the time Richards does, with room to
spare.

   ``Tighten Up Vol. 88'' (Columbia) _ Big Audio Dynamite
   
   Mick Jones, once the fiery guitarist of punk heroes The Clash,
now seems a little like a roguish older brother.
   He lectures a lot, mostly about respecting the rights of others.
His music, once loud and brash, is more melodic and _ dare we say _
nearly laid back. The cover of his group's new album shows him
dressed in a tuxedo, although with a lipstick stain on his face and
clutching a wine bottle.
   Big Audio Dynamite's first album a few years back was an
exciting synthesis of rock and urban rhythms, mixed in with the
``found sounds'' of old movie clips. The second album was a less
exciting take on the same idea.
   Jones and his usual writing partner, Don Letts, are neither
melodically adventurous nor particularly good singers, so many
B.A.D. songs tend to sound the same. The group needed to stretch
out a bit, and for the most part do it successfully on ``Tighten Up
Vol. 88''
   Jones' old group wanted to save the world, now the ambitions are
scaled back. ``No one gets 10 out of 10,'' he sings on ``Other
99,'' ``You gotta strive for five.''
   In ``Funny Names,'' he sings, ``You're not like me. I'm not like
you. Don't mean we can't get along.''
   Their utopian outlook would sound naive if it wasn't so
good-natured. B.A.D. doesn't take itself too seriously, unlike the
Clash. One of the best songs here, ``Just Play Music,'' rejects
rock star trappings and suggests good music is really quite simple.
   That's not just a lyrical approach. B.A.D. uses some familiar
Chuck Berry riffs, borrows from the old standard ``Battle of New
Orleans'' and generally goes for straightforward rock on this
album. But many of the songs are sweetened by synthesizers and few
have a particularly hard edge.
   Big Audio Dynamite can consider this a rebound from the
sophomore slump.

   ``Hot Water'' (MCA) _ Jimmy Buffett
   
   There was a time when Jimmy Buffett sang cleverly, and sometimes
even movingly, about everything from life, love and loneliness to
cheeseburgers, gas station robberies and the sea.
   That was more than a decade ago now, before Buffett began a
long, sad slide that finds him, again, in ``Hot Water,''
desperately trying to breathe life into the cliche that he has
become, America's Official Tropical Hedonist.
   The new LP is cruise-line predictable. He softly sings the
praises of the Louisiana air (or, as he affectedly sings en
francais, ``L'Air de la Louisiane'') _ only a dozen years after he
sang the same song about ``Biloxi,'' one state away. Here comes the
``Prince of Tides.'' There goes the ``King of Somewhere Hot.''
   This isn't rock 'n' roll; this is the Weather Channel.
   Musically, things are little better. There's an all-star guest
list _ Steve Winwood, the Neville Brothers, even Grover Washington
Jr. _ but what you hear here, mon, is the misplaced sound of steel
drums.
   And if the pseudo-Caribbean schtick weren't wearing thin by now,
``Hot Water'' finds Buffett pretentious _ three of these songs
begin with spoken soliloquies _ and mean-spirited. When he's not
complaining that his songs aren't on the radio, he's bordering on
misogyny: complaining that ``baby's gone shopping'' when she ought
to stay home, forsaking ``bimbo limbo'' to search for a ``smart
woman in a real short skirt.''
   Buffett's magic with his audience has been that they wished they
could live their lives like his songs. Songs like these make it
hard to remember why anyone ever felt that way.

<HEAD>Star Watch: The Frank, Intense and Combative Kirk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kirk Douglas' autobiography, ``The Ragman's
Son,'' has spent weeks on non-fiction best-seller lists, a position
generally accorded such female stars as Lauren Bacall, Shelley
Winters and Ingrid Bergman.
   How did Douglas make the magic list when other actors have
failed? The secret may be that his book is just as frank, intense
and combative as the public's image of Kirk Douglas over the past
four decades.
   Douglas has never walked away from a fight. Many a producer,
director and co-star can recall scars acquired in encounters with
Kirk. He turned his back on a seven-year contract from Hal Wallis
at a time when most actors would grab it. He defied the industry
powers by hiring the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo to write
``Spartacus.''
   As revealed in ``The Ragman's Son,'' he romanced a wide range of
Hollywood's glamour queens, including Joan Crawford, Gene Tierney,
Marlene Dietrich, Ann Sothern and Rita Hayworth.
   Douglas seems to be a man who got everything he wanted. But he
had two great frustrations. He was madly in love with Pier Angeli,
but despite their engagement, he could never escape her
ever-present parents. He starred in ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest'' on Broadway but could never make a movie deal. He became too
old for the role, and son Michael co-produced the film, which won
an Academy Award for Jack Nicholson.
   Douglas, a vigorous 69, recently reminisced about his life and
times at the Beverly Hills offices of Bryna Productions, named for
his mother. He told of the inception of his autobiography.
   ``I was driving to Palm Springs one day, and I saw a sailor
hitchhiking. I had been in the Navy, so I picked him up. When he
got in the car, he looked at me and said, `Do you know who you are?'
   ``Well, I thought about that, and it's an interesting
question,'' he said.
   The actor's search for Kirk Douglas led him to Issur
Danielovitch, the son of illiterate, Russian-Jewish immigrants in
Amsterdam, N.Y. The father was a cold, distant, brawling alcoholic
whose love neither Issur nor Kirk could achieve.
   ``It's a terrible thing for a young kid who has a father who's
so physically strong,'' said Douglas. ``You think, `My God, I can
never be that strong, I can never be that big.' My father was a rag
man, yet to me he was somebody. So living with my six sisters and
my mother, I had no identity.
   ``When my father left, I thought, `Why am I not with my father?
I'm a boy! Why am I with the women?'''
   Young Issur escaped the ``suffocating'' female atmosphere to
attend St. Lawrence College, and he never went home again, except
for brief visits. He discovered acting in college, went on to New
York where his looks _ like carved granite _ and intense style
attracted Hollywood offers. And he went on his own terms.
   ``From the very beginning, I was always independent, a
maverick,'' he remarked. ``I didn't belong to any studio. There
were good things about that, but there were bad things, too. It was
lonely. Everybody else belonged to studios, and they were going to
singing and dancing lessons.
   ``There were a lot of good things to be said for the oldtime
studio system that I did not belong to. They developed stars and
got parts for them in movies. I wasn't part of that. I was sort of
outside.''
   Douglas' film career has been marked by an affinity for forceful
heroic roles, from his part as a calculating boxer in 1949's
``Champion'' to his depiction of Vincent Van Gogh in 1956's ``Lust
for Life.'' Both films earned him Academy Award nominations.
   In ``Spartacus,'' perhaps Douglas' greatest role, he starred as
the leader of slaves rebelling against Republican Rome. At the same
time, Douglas has shown a flair for the comic, especially as a
sharp-tongued inmate in the 1970 movie ``There Was a Crooked Man.''
   His first film role came in 1946's ``The Strange Love of Martha
Ivers,'' and his last appearance was in the 1987 NBC production of
``Inherit the Wind.'' Douglas has been known for his frankness, and
he had these evaluations about some of his friends and colleagues:
   John Wayne: ``One of the most remarkable men I ever worked with.
We never got along, though we did four pictures together.
Politically we were complete opposites.''
   Burt Lancaster: ``I like Burt. He's quite different; for
example, he's a great lover of music and opera. Most people would
never expect that of Burt. If I ever need Burt, I call him; if he
needs me, he calls me. It's a wonderful relationship.''
   Barbara Stanwyck (who starred in his first film): ``She was
pretty tough with me at first. I was new, didn't know anybody, and
she sort of ignored me for two weeks. But I always forgive any
slights like that when I see talent and a professional attitude.''
   Robert Mitchum: ``Never my kind of guy. I always kidded him
about those stories he'd tell about being a hobo; they seemed to
change every time he told them. But obviously he is a talented guy,
and listen, he's had a tremendous career.''
   Michael Douglas: ``The nicest thing I can say about Michael is
what I put in a note some time ago; he told me it's the only note
of mine he has kept. I said to him, `Michael, I'm more proud of how
you handle your success than I am of your success.' And I think
we'll still be hearing a lot from him.''
   Kirk Douglas: ``Kirk Douglas ... Issur Danielovitch, the
ragman's son. I've taken 450 pages to try to explain who I am. And
I'm not sure I know yet.
   ``The best way to sum it up would be in the character of
McMurphy in `One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest,' the role I so
desperately wanted to play on the screen. McMurphy tries to lift
this piece of machinery and fails. They're all looking and feeling
sorry for him. He turns to face them and says, `But I tried.
Dammit, I tried.'''

<HEAD>The Artists: International Applause for Opera in English</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lights go up on ``Carmen'' to reveal an
extravagantly gaudy junkyard that owes as much to ``West Side
Story'' as it does to the fiery passions of composer Georges Bizet.
   Another night sees Giacomo Puccini's ``Tosca'' updated to the
fascist Rome of World War II and performed on a tilted stage.
   The two productions are the season openers at the English
National Opera, a company that is making an international name for
itself not only on the strength of its singing but for its
imaginative stagings.
   Launched by Lilian Baylis as the Sadler's Wells Opera in 1931,
the company moved to its present home, the 2,358-seat London
Coliseum, in 1968. It changed its name to the English National
Opera in 1974, and has since gathered a burgeoning reputation for
productions that prize the work over individual stars, and artistic
vision over vanity vehicles.
   ``We are a theater and not a museum,'' music director Mark Elder
said in an interview. ``Theater needs to be exploratory, renewing,
inquisitive. ... It's not just a matter of doing the old classics
in a sensationalistic way.''
   Indeed not. For although the ENO has launched its 21st season at
the Coliseum with two warhorses, ``Tosca'' and ``Carmen,'' the
breadth of its repertory also includes Broadway musicals, Stephen
Sondheim's ``Pacific Overtures'' and commissioned British works,
such as David Blake's ``The Plumber's Gift.''
   Nov. 9 sees the European premiere of Philip Glass' ``The Making
of the Representative for Planet 8,'' the American composer's first
work at the ENO since ``Akhnaten'' in 1985. In December, ENO mounts
the first professional British staging of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's
1895 ``Christmas Eve.'' In January, the ENO will have the British
debut of Aribert Reimann's ``Lear,'' based on the Shakespeare
tragedy.
   It's the same eclectic mix of the tested and the untried that
has wrought what Nicholas Kenyon in The New York Times called ``a
revolution in the standard of theater being offered to
opera-goers.''
   ``I take for granted that ENO is the reference point of
adventurous, living music theater,'' said Peter Jonas, the
company's artistic director.
   ``Opera took a long time to be accepted as essential in British
life. ... We've done a certain amount to help that.''
   The ENO is responsible for 46 percent of the annual operatic
activity in Britain. During its 10-month 1988-89 season, the
company will present 204 performances of 18 operas in what Jonas
calls ``one of the heaviest repertory systems in the world.''
   Production costs range from $33,500 to $295,000. The upper
figure is about half the cost of the most expensive productions at
the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, the ENO's principal London
rival.
   In 1984, the company toured five American cities, winning raves
from Houston to New York with works ranging from Giuseppe Verdi's
1851 ``Rigoletto,'' transplanted to New York's Little Italy a
century later, to Benjamin Britten's patriotic 1953 ``Gloriana.''
   The company's white-tie-and-tails version of ``The Mikado'' was
to be broadcast by PBS in late October. In spring 1990, plans are
in the works to perform a Czech opera and Kurt Weill's 1949
``Street Scene'' in the Soviet Union.
   Wherever the ENO appears, one constant remains: It presents all
foreign-language operas in English translations, whether it's
Prokofiev or Puccini, Mozart or Massenet.
   ``What is missing is the texture of the original language,''
said British soprano Josephine Barstow.
   But Barstow understands the policy, even if she didn't always
agree with it: ``The fact that the ENO always does perform in
English is one reason why the audience has such a high level of
concentration. Nowhere in the world have I personally encountered
such concentration. Audiences come to listen and to think.''
   She said it proved useful to performers, too.
   ``It's an enormous advantage to young singers to sing a major
role like Salome in their own language,'' said Barstow, who first
sang Richard Strauss' vengeful heroine for the ENO in 1975. ``It's
quite easy to learn opera in a language you speak reasonably well.''
   Familiar works fuel the debate. A new production of Verdi's ``La
Traviata'' won mixed reviews both for peculiarities of its staging
and lapses in translation.
   But earlier stagings in English of Dmitri Shostakovich's
lesser-known ``Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk'' and Leos Janacek's ``The
Makropolous Case,'' both starring Barstow, helped secure those
operas' exalted positions within the world repertory.
   In November, Barstow travels to the San Francisco Opera to sing
``Lady Macbeth'' for the first time in Russian, which she might
never have done had she not attempted it first in English.
   ``I've tried out a lot of roles with the ENO before I've done
them elsewhere,'' said Barstow.
   She is one of several singers who has reached international
status through the ENO. Others include Thomas Allen, Felicity Lott
and Richard Van Allan.
   In September, she appeared as a soloist in Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony under the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In 1989-90, she is
scheduled to sing the Marschallin in Strauss' ``Der Rosenkavalier''
at the Houston Grand Opera.
   Peter Jonas is pleased that alumni-turned-stars more often than
not return to their roots: ``You do pinch yourself and think, `Oh
he's lost to us.' But quite a few come back in very favorable
positions.''
   ``I suppose I'm one of the most loyal ones, if you like,'' said
Barstow, who acknowledges the ENO as home base.
   ``It's comforting to feel you belong somewhere in the whole big
world of opera.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Marti Jones Wants a Part of the World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marti Jones doesn't want to take over the whole
world, just a small part.
   ``I don't have that drive to want to be this huge superstar
because I'm just having fun doing what I'm doing,'' said Jones,
whose third album, ``Used Guitars,'' was released this summer.
   ``But I'd be stupid not to notice when people hear the record on
the radio, they go out and buy it. I can go to Washington, D.C.,
and play halls, fill 1,400-seat halls. Other places, with no
airplay, you get maybe 50 people saying `Who is she?'''
   Jones has slowly accumulated a following over the last few
years, earning praise for interprations of songs by John Hiatt and
Graham Parker, and for the original material created by herself and
producer Don Dixon.
   It's tempting to define Jones as a ``Critics' Choice,'' someone
who receives good reviews but doesn't sell many records. Jones
would like to be successful both artistically and commercially, not
just for herself, but for the songwriters she covers.
   That spirit came out this summer at a concert at the ``Bottom
Line'' in New York, when Jones brought out many of the songwriters
featured on ``Used Guitars.'' Those appearing included Hiatt,
Parker and the team of Janis Ian and Kye Fleming, who wrote two
songs on the new record.
   ``We had so much fun,'' Jones recalled. ``Everybody tossed their
egos out the door. Everybody rooted for everybody else. Nobody
complained about having enough time.
   ``Nobody got paid. We covered their expenses for traveling and
that was it. What a bunch of pals. It was just the whole spirit of
the thing. It was like `Dick Clark's Cavalcade of Stars.' Everybody
does their best five songs.''
   Jones, who still lives in her native Ohio, grew up in the 1960s
hearing a wide variety of music.
   ``My parents had Burl Ives and the Kingston Trio,'' she said.
``My sisters listened to Top 40, the Beatles, Temptations and
Supremes. Later, I went into the heavy Joni Mitchell scene, but at
the same time I'd take out a Jimi Hendrix record and put it on.''
   She began singing at an early age and idolized the late country
legend Patsy Cline. But Jones' own vocals can best be compared to
the British singer, Dusty Springfield.
   ``I started reading reviews and they kept saying, `Dusty
Springfield, Dusty Springfield.' and I thought, `What does she
sound like?' Dixon had this compilation of British hits and we
listened to it and I went, `They're right.' I'm really flattered.
She's a great singer. It was eerie.''
   Jones was in her first band, ``Color Me Gone,'' when she met
Dixon, now her husband and also producer of R.E.M.
   ``Somebody had the brilliant idea to re-record two of the six
songs on the album,'' she said, rolling her eyes. ``We had already
done them 20 million times in 20 million ways.
   ``They flew in Don Dixon as a candidate for a producer. I really
liked him. He was a nice guy. He had this attitude that nothing's a
big deal. Great attitude.''
   After Jones left the group, Dixon got in touch with her.
   ``He said, `I caught your name at the bottom of my drawer and I
always liked your singing, what are you planning on doing?' The
record label put the two of us together.''
   Jones credits Dixon with helping develop her own sound.
   ``I wasn't sure what my sound was as a singer because I had been
singing songs that were not really the kind I wanted to sing,''
Jones said.
   ``He helped me pick out songs and built my confidence up.''
   Jones' first album, ``Unsophisticated Time,'' came out in 1984
and has set the tone for her career so far: original songs and
covers; good reviews and poor sales.
   ``The record company didn't push the record. They thought it
sounded like a demo,'' she said.
   ``Match Game,'' released in 1986, continued the pattern. Jones
combined original songs with covers of Elvis Costello and Marshall
Crenshaw among others.
   ``Used Guitars'' has 11 songs, three of them Dixon-Jones
originals. The songs range from ``Ruby,'' a bluesy ballad written
by Ian and Fleming, to the mainstream pop of ``Tourist Town,'' a
Dixon-Jones composition.
   The creative process of ``covering'' a song can be compared to
an actor reading a script _ taking words written by someone else
and turning them into the artist's own personal experience.
   Jones isn't concerned about how many of her own songs are put on
each album. She believes in using the best material possible, no
matter who wrote it.
   ``Hopefully, people are opening up a little more to realizing a
song is a song and it doesn't matter if the person's who's singing
it, wrote it,'' she said. ``I could write an album's worth of
material in two weeks but I don't think it would be good enough.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Striving for Perfection Is Not Perfectly Normal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karen makes $250,000 a year working for E.F.
Hutton and prides herself on being ``a shark.'' Anita runs miles
every day but has been bulimic for eight years. Marjorie has made
straight A's all her life but panics and overprepares for every
test.
   What all these women have in common, says Colette Dowling, is an
overwhelming desire to achieve perfection. In her book ``Perfect
Women'' (Summit, $18.95), Dowling argues that this striving for
ever-higher goals _ hours of aerobics every day, 60-hour work
weeks, making every meal from scratch _ is not a healthy exercise
to fulfill one's potential but a desperate scramble to fill an
inner void.
   ``An artistic drive is satisfying. A drive to perform is not.
... It's a kind of rigid, compulsive _ kind of a symptom, as
compared to something that's really joyful and self-expressive and
gives back to us,'' the author said.
   Dowling, best known for her 1981 best seller ``The Cinderella
Complex,'' recently talked about her new book in an interview at
her publisher's office.
   ``The whole drive to be perfect comes out of a feeling of
inferiority,'' she said. ``We wouldn't even be interested in the
idea of perfection if there wasn't something that we
psychologically were compensating for.''
   Asked why she thinks this striving for perfection is unique to
women, Dowling said, ``Women as an entire gender have been
disparaged culturally for eons, and it's a particular kind of
gender feeling about self that gets handed down from the mother to
the daughter.
   ``And now that there's so much opportunity available to women, I
think we've just stepped into a new kind of performance arena. I
think we're using our achievements to bolster our self-esteem, in
the way we used to use our appearance or our cooking or our
housekeeping skills or whatever.''
   She cites a litany of symptoms from which these overachievers
suffer: anorexia and bulimia; drug and alcohol problems; compulsive
shopping. All except the drug and alcohol abuse are overwhelmingly
female problems.
   The premise of the ``Cinderella Complex'' was that women had a
deep-seated belief that they could not take care of themselves,
that despite the gains of the women's movement they were still
waiting for a Prince Charming to whisk them off to happily ever
after.
   Dowling, 50, said that work was based on her own experience. In
the 1970s, after ending a 9-year-marriage to an alcoholic, she
moved in with a man she still lives with in New York's Hudson
Valley. There, Dowling, who had supported herself and her three
children as a free-lance writer, abandoned her career and became a
full-time housewife. Her partner's refusal to accept her
dependency, as well as the therapy she was undergoing, gave her the
initiative to write ``The Cinderella Complex.''
   ``Perfect Women'' is similarly based on Dowling's personal
experience. The author found that despite the success of ``The
Cinderella Complex'' (26 weeks on the best-seller list) she still
felt insecure about her work and at a loss for her next project.
   At the same time, her eldest daughter, Gabrielle, a star
scholar, athlete and beauty, dropped out of Harvard University and
revealed that she had been bulimic for years. Dowling realized that
her own relentless drive for success _ so she could like herself _
had been passed down to her daughter.
   In ``Perfect Women,'' Dowling cites psychological studies
detailing the mother-daughter relationship that starts at the crib.
   ``They (mothers) are not overly involved with us (daughters) as
separate persons; they're overly involved with us as extensions of
themselves,'' Dowling said. ``This sticky kind of bonding is very
unique to the mother-daughter relationship. This is not to say boys
don't have their own problems, because God knows they do, but this
is something very specific to the gender.''
   The way for a woman to get off the perfection treadmill, she
said, is to psychologically separate herself from her mother, which
can be done through therapy, self-exploration, perhaps
confrontation.
   ``Perfect Women'' suffers from the kind of generalized
prescription that most self-help books offer, but if it makes a few
self-improvement junkies stop buying these kinds of pop psychology
books and learn to accept themselves as they are, then it's done
its work.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Charlie Daniels And His Hard Driving Music</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firebrand fiddler Charlie Daniels called
the devil a nasty name in his million-selling record, ``The Devil
Went Down to Georgia.'' He also told the Russians where they could
go in his song, ``In America.''
   His new album, ``Homesick Heroes,'' is less polemical and
contains music that best portrays his band's style.
   ``It's what we are,'' he said. ``Hard driving music.''
   The rollicking album is the 18th in 17 years for the
irrepressible five-piece rock-country band that has performed in
all 50 states and several foreign countries.
   In it, Daniels plays a blazing fiddle to the flash point in
``Boogie Woogie Fiddle Country Blues,'' a hit single. He plays
rousing guitar licks on other songs, and sings sassy, gritty vocals
on still others.
   The LP is a turn away from his last album, ``Powder Keg,'' which
he described as the most rock-oriented LP he has recorded.
   ``It didn't do too well at all,'' Daniels said in an interview.
``It's still selling, but it never really got off the ground.''
   ``It was time for a change. The new album is a career move.''
   Country fans will welcome the sound from the ``kingfish of
Southern roots music'' whose traditional garb is a huge bullrider
cowboy hat, cowboy boots, jeans and vest.
   He and his band are best known for their Grammy-winning 1980
hit, ``The Devil Went Down to Georgia,'' the story of a feverish
fiddle contest between the devil and a boy named Johnny in which he
called the devil a mild obscenity. The single sold 1.6 million
copies and the ``Million Mile Reflections'' album that contained it
sold 2.3 million.
   ``It had mass appeal,'' Daniels said about the song. ``I guess
the lyrics of the song were responsible for 70-75 percent of the
popularity and the fiddle and the novelty value had a lot to do
with it.''
   The blunt lyrics in that song were similar to the ones in his
``In America,'' in which he issued his memorable directive to the
Soviets amid a burst of American pride.
   On topical subjects, Daniels' ``American Farmer'' focused on the
plight of agriculture in the mid-1980s. ``Still in Saigon'' was
about a former soldier haunted by his Vietnam experience. Other
songs by the band, such as ``Long Haired Country Boy'' and ``Uneasy
Rider,'' are more satirical.
   ``I poke fun at rednecks, hippies, politicians, all kinds of
people,'' said Daniels, a native of Wilmington, N.C.
   The band traveled 75,000 miles last year, making 116 concert
stops. In 1986, they grossed nearly $14 million and drew more than
750,000 paid admissions.
   Amid all the travel and hit records, Daniels has done a little
acting. He was in ``Murder, She Wrote'' and ``Lone Star Kid'' on
the Public Broadcasting Service.
   He and the band were featured in the movie, ``Urban Cowboy,''
and their ``Stroker's Theme'' was the title track for Burt
Reynolds' movie ``Stroker Ace.''
   Daniels' writing has not been restricted to songs. In 1985, he
wrote a book of short stories, ``The Devil Went Down to Georgia.''
   Daniels said one of his proudest achievements has been keeping
his band members together so long. Three members have been with him
at least 14 years.
   ``It seems like I've had Taz (DiGregorio, his keyboard player)
since two days after he was born,'' Daniels said.
   ``We're sincere,'' he said about the band's success and its
togetherness. ``I keep a 12-month payroll. We have the philosophy
that we do the best we can all the time. We get to stretch out some
as musicians. Everybody gets to use their ideas and share in the
songwriting royalties. I try to treat people well and look after
our folks.
   ``We try real hard,'' he said. ``I want to do the best I can do:
cut every record the best, write every song the best, do every show
the best, have the most efficient organization in the music
business.
   ``I want the deejays to pick up a Charlie Daniels Band record
and say, `Here's a record by the Charlie Daniels Band and I want to
play this.'
   ``Quality. You can't beat it.''

<HEAD>Biological Pest Controls, A Natural Solution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Mexican mite is being tested
against the Colorado potato beetle that also devastates tomatoes
and eggplants. A Chinese wasp may stop a butterfly that eats
broccoli, cabbage and Brussels sprouts.
   Humans increasingly have allies in the enemy camp in the war on
insects.
   Biological controls like these and others using insects against
problem plants have been used commercially for more than 100 years,
racking up hundreds of successes. In the last 10 years, though,
interest has grown.
   Last year, for example, the federal government spent more than
$85 million on nearly 800 biological control projects, four times
the number in existence a decade ago, said Jim Cate of the U.S.
Agriculture Department.
   ``We are now just getting back into an era where entomologists
are realizing you can't solve the problem with pesticides alone,'
said Robert Metcalf, who has worked more than 50 years on pest
controls. ``For a long time there were advocates of the sole use of
each one. Now I think you'll find almost everybody agrees you need
a little of each.''
   ``There are many different crop pests that have been serious and
are not serious because they have been able to find biological
controls,'' said Patrick Logan, a University of Rhode Island
entomologist working on potato beetles.
   The mites, Chrysomelobia lapidomerae Eickwort, live on adult
beetles and suck fluid from them. Up to 2,000 can infest each
beetle. They can shorten the beetles' lifespans up to 50 percent,
reducing the number of eggs laid, and they hinder the beetles'
flying ability, reducing migration, Logan said.
   University of Massachusetts researchers are studying a \-inch
wasp from northwest China named Apanteles rubecula, which inserts
its tiny needle into a cabbage butterfly larva and lays eggs. The
wasp larvae eat the pest.
   The wasps have flourished in a patch of collard greens in
Deerfield, Mass., and have attacked an estimated 40 percent of the
butterfly larvae in the field, said entomologist Roy Van Dreische.
The needles are too small to hurt humans.
   Most insects became pests after their natural environments were
upset, letting them run rampant. Others were accidentally imported
on vegetables and plants to areas where they had no natural
predators.
   Biological controls seek to restore nature's balance.
   ``It's a totally natural way to regulate (pest) populations,''
said Metcalf, 72, a professor at the University of Illinois in
Urbana and a member of the National Academy of Science. ``It
doesn't pollute, it doesn't cost anything if it works, it's
self-regulating and self-correcting.''
   Still, biological controls aren't always sucessful, and can be
virtually ineffective as with the gypsy moth.
   The gypsy moth escaped from a Massachusetts researcher in 1882
as he was trying to cross it with a silkworm to make stronger silk.
It feeds on oak trees and occassionally neighborhood rose gardens,
but isn't a problem in its native Europe where more than 100
insects prey upon it, Metcalf said.
   In this country, it ``can make a forest look like winter in
June,'' sad Tom ODell, a research entomologist at the U.S. Forest
Research Service in Hamden, Conn. This year the moth ravaged areas
of Virginia and Washington, D.C.
   From 1905 to 1911, researchers brought 2 million species of the
moth's natural enemies from Europe and the Soviet Union, said
Logan. But the effort failed because, ``in Europe there are a large
number of natural enemies, each of which controls a small number''
of the moths. Of the 127 species introduced against the moth, only
eight have survived in this country, said ODell.
   ``It's not like some of the other pests where we've been able to
to find a single natural enemy that regulates it,'' Logan said.
   One of 225 successful uses of biological controls was against
the Cottony Cushiony Scale, which almost wiped out the California
citrus industry after it was inadvertently brought to the United
States in the 1880s, said Cate, who is also a researcher at Texas A
& M University.
   An Agriculture Department entomologist brought the Vendalia
beetle, a type of ladybug and a natural enemy of the scale, from
Australia, said Metcalf. That worked until after World War II, when
DDT killed off the beetle.
   In fact, many pests became a problem when pesticides killed
their natural enemies, Logan said. But pesticides can also be
ineffective because the harmful insects develop a tolerance to the
chemicals, and development can't keep up.
   ``It costs several million dollars to formulate a new material _
to develop it, test it. It's very slow, very expensive,'' he said.
   The introduction of biological controls also is slow. Despite
the growth in the number of projects over the past decade, the
level of federal funding has stayed relatively stable when adjusted
for inflation, Cates said.
   Also, scientists face delays while they work to show the
government that their controls are harmless to all but the pest.
   The Mexican mite, being tested at the University of Rhode
Island, was quarantined for six months before scientists could
prove it was a species known in this country. Then the government
required tests to show it would not harm beneficial insects like
ladybugs or honeybees.
   It took seven years from the time the mite was found until it
was approved.
   Reassuringly, ``There just haven't been any notable examples of
anything going wrong with this process,'' said Metcalf.
   Biological controls also may be victims of their own success.
When they work ``people forget they had a problem,'' said Cate.
``You solve the pest problem and you walk away from it.''
   Companies that invest huge sums in research, ``want a return on
their investment,'' said Logan. ``Nobody is going to make any money
off importing exotic insects,'' Cate said.
   As a result, smaller, isolated pests, like the potato beetle,
are often overlooked by the large chemical companies.

<HEAD>Japanese Doctors Shy From Giving Cancer Patients Details</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost 200,000 Japanese died last year of cancer,
most without knowing they had it _ unless they figured it out
themselves.
   Their doctors hadn't told them the truth.
   Traditionally, the Japanese have been unlikely to question the
authority of the medical profession, but that appears to be
changing as a well-educated people want to know more about what
ails them.
   And doctors are thinking about revising their ethics, which have
been based on the belief that patients are depressed if told they
have cancer, and will die happier if they don't know.
   ``I guess about 90 percent of the doctors still don't tell,''
said Toshio Takahashi, professor of surgery at Kyoto Prefectural
University of Medicine.
   But to Jinro Itami, cancer specialist at Shibata Hospital in
Okayama, the real issue is not the propriety of informing patients
but how to reduce their fear of death and increase their ``fighting
spirit.''
   Itami four years ago founded a patient-support program called
Meaningful Life Therapy. Seven of his patients attempted a
morale-building climb of Mount Blanc in Switzerland last summer,
and three of them reached the summit.
   ``The earlier patients know about their condition, the better
off they are,'' he said, adding that witholding information can
create fear and sorrow and delay recovery.
   The debate, of course, is not limited to Japan. Soviet doctors
generally avoid telling a patient directly, according to Dr.
Nikolai Napalkov, president of the U.S.S.R. Oncological Society. In
the United States, doctors tend toward disclosure, said Dr. Steven
Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute.
   Itami said it is almost impossible to keep patients ignorant as
they hear about the disease and its treatments everywhere.
   But even he says that unless patients are ready for the worst,
telling them will only cause depression. Instead, he guides them to
want to know about their illness and its treatment. ``It is very
important for patients to know about their own lives and their
condition,'' he said.
   The public seems to agree. About 60 percent want doctors to tell
them even if there is no hope of recovery, according to a poll of
5,608 adults a year ago by the Mainichi Shimbun, a Japanese
national daily. If the disease is likely to be cured, 78 percent
want to know.
   A separate poll of 500 doctors showed 76 percent would not tell
the patient if the condition is hopeless.
   ``It should be us patients, not doctors, that decide how to live
the days left in front of us,'' said Haruyo Inouye, a 37-year-old
free-lance writer who had a breast cancer operation in April.
``Doctors should tell us so that we don't have to waste time being
scared because of ignorance.''
   She complained that her doctor had not told her the side effect
of a hormonal medicine she took after surgery. She was shocked when
her menstruation became irregular, thinking something else was
wrong with her.
   Toshiro Murase, pediatrician and executive member of the Japan
Medical Association's board of trustees, said it's important to
respect the patient's right to know but satisfying the right to
know is a different story.
   ``Some patients might be able to end their lives happier without
knowing everything,'' he said, adding that Japanese doctors' most
important task is to help reduce their patients' physical pain.
   There never has been a court ruling in Japan over the issue of a
patient's right to know, said lawyer Katsuji Hotta, who recently
was named to a committee to examine the issue for Japan's Medical
Association.
   The association has decided to investigate medical, moral and
legal aspects of medical treatment, and appointed 10 people from
various professions to talk about ``explanation and consent.'' The
group includes novelist Ayako Sono; the president of the Japan
Federation of Employers Association, Eiji Suzuki; philosopher
Yujiro Nakamura and professors of medicine.
   Cancer is Japan's No. 1 killer disease, causing 26.6 percent of
all deaths last year, with stomach cancer topping the list.

   A Mexican mite is being tested
against the Colorado potato beetle that also devastates tomatoes
and eggplants. A Chinese wasp may stop a butterfly that eats
broccoli, cabbage and Brussels sprouts.
   Humans increasingly have allies in the enemy camp in the war on
insects.
   Biological controls like these and others using insects against
problem plants have been used commercially for more than 100 years,
racking up hundreds of successes. In the last 10 years, though,
interest has grown.
   Last year, for example, the federal government spent more than
$85 million on nearly 800 biological control projects, four times
the number in existence a decade ago, said Jim Cate of the U.S.
Agriculture Department.
   ``We are now just getting back into an era where entomologists
are realizing you can't solve the problem with pesticides alone,'
said Robert Metcalf, who has worked more than 50 years on pest
controls.
   ``There are many different crop pests that have been serious and
are not serious because they have been able to find biological
controls,'' said Patrick Logan, a University of Rhode Island
entomologist working

<HEAD>Scientists Seek Physics Answers at Cornell Cold Spot</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Restores dropped word `temperature' in 2nd graf.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>

   There are no dangling icicles in Clark Hall,
no frost on the walls, and breathing doesn't produce vapor clouds.
But it's still one of the coldest known spots in the universe.
   ``It doesn't look very impressive but we are going to go a
million times colder than the coldest natural place we know of,''
says Robert C. Richardson, head of the low-temperature physics
group at Cornell University's Microkelvin Laboratory.
   Richardson and his colleagues, using a $1.5 million
super-refrigeration unit, will try to achieve absolute zero _ the
temperature at which even atoms stop rubbing together and creating
heat.
   ``We think we can take it down to between 1 and 10
microkelvin,'' he said. ``And each step of the way, we could be
finding new effects.''
   The only other U.S. deep-freeze laboratory is under construction
at the University of Florida. Labs in Japan and England have hit 12
microkelvin.
   How cold is that?
   The temperature of deep space, minus 270 degrees Fahrenheit, is
only 3 on the Kelvin scale, which uses absolute zero for a
reference point. Absolute zero in Fahrenheit is minus 459 degrees,
while room temperature would be 293 Kelvin.
   A millikelvin is a thousandth of a Kelvin, so a microkelvin is a
millionth.
   Dropping from 12 microkelvin to 10 microkelvin might seem
inconsequential, but Richardson adds this perspective: ``If you
increased room temperature by the same ratio, everything would melt
or disintegrate.''
   The researchers aren't simply out to break records, though.
   ``The importance of this type of research lies in realizing the
strange things that happen at low temperatures,'' said William
Oosterhuis, section head of the condensed matter sciences unit at
the National Science Foundation. ``One just never knows what's
going to happen. This research provides us with a probe into an
area where we've never been before.''
   Among the strange discoveries of extremely low-temperature
research has been superconductivity _ electricity with no loss to
resistance _ at 4 Kelvin.
   ``Sometimes it is the arithmetic or the theory behind the
research that has the practical application,'' said Donald H.
Liebenberg, who helped the lab get NSF funding before he left in
April for the Office of Naval Research.
   ``Sometimes the technology produced has broader applications in
other fields. The most important aspect, though, is that these
facilities will be breeding grounds of technological spinoffs for
future low temperature research,'' Liebenberg said.
   Individual scientists have conducted low temperature research
before, but the lack of a permanent facility to maintain such
temperatures indefinitely and allow for varied experiments has been
an obstacle, Richardson said. ``Now we have an adequate tool to
find _ or at least search properly _ for the answers to all the
open questions that remain in front of us.''
   The rooms adjoining Cornell's 2,800-square-foot underground
laboratory are designed to eliminate all stray heat, including that
produced from the most minute vibrations and from radio-frequency
electrical signals.
   To that end, they are lined with butcher block wood and
galvanized electromagnetic shielding and have specially grounded
electrical wiring and incandescent lighting. The low temperature
instruments are secured by concrete sewer pipes filled with sand.
   The supercooling machines themselves are rigid aluminum, filled
with liquid helium, copper and superconducting magnets. The
apparatus stands 12 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds, but the
focus is on a 36-inch vacuum cylinder.
   To reach microkelvin temperatures, a process that takes about
two weeks, scientists first polarize copper with a superconducting
magnet, then cool it to around 10 millikelvin in the refrigerator,
which uses liquid helium rather than freon gas for cooling. Once
the copper is at 10 millikelvin, the magnetic field is reduced and
the copper nuclei, which are now aligned and highly ordered, take
over, further cooling everything in the surrounding medium.
   ``We can never be sure what will be found,'' said Richardson.
``Maybe we'll have the good fortune to stumble upon a new science.''

   Food costs, showing further effects from the
drought, accelerated sharply in September, but a big drop in energy
costs kept the overall rise in wholesale prices at a moderate 0.4
percent, the government reported.
   The Reagan administration claimed that Friday's report showed
inflation was not heating up. But some private economists expressed
worries about what could happen if world oil prices suddenly
rebound.
   The September increase represented a drop from an August
increase of 0.6 percent.

dip of 0.1 percent in August and was the first back-to-back drop
since September-October 1987.

   Americans are confident of a stable national
economy and improving personal finances the next few years, but
they remain wary of Wall Street, a Media General-Associated Press
poll has found.
   A year after the stock market crashed, 71 percent of the 1,125
adults in the national survey said they regard it as a risky place
to invest, and fully a third saw a good chance it will plummet
again in the next year or two.
   But three-quarters said the crash had little or no effect on
their lives, and only one in 10 said their finances had worsened in
the past year. Even among the wealthiest, seven in 10 felt little
impact from the crash.
   There was one apparent residual impact from the market's crash:
More than six in 10 in the survey said they were being more
cautious with their money now than they were a year ago.
   The Dow Jones industrial average dived 508 points on Oct. 19,
1987, after dropping 108 points the previous Friday. Stock losses
amounted to $500 billion, but the crash did not spark a recession,
as had been feared.
   In the poll, 25 percent expected the nation's economy to worsen
in the next few years. But nearly as many said it would improve,
and a 43 percent plurality said they expected little change in the
economy.
   There was even greater optimism about personal gains. Fifty-five
percent expected their family's economic situation to improve in
the short term, a third expected to hold steady and only 6 percent
expected to do worse.
   The survey found a receptive audience for Republican
presidential nominee George Bush's theme of national prosperity.
Most expressed satisfaction with their family's income, with 57
percent saying they were ``doing all right'' and 9 percent rating
themselves ``well off.''
   Nonetheless, a considerable 29 percent said they were ``just
getting by'' and 5 percent said they were ``in hard times''
financially. The true number likely is higher because telephone
surveys exclude the poorest households, the 7 percent without
phones.
   A third in the poll said their family finances were better off
now compared to a year ago, and a 56 percent majority said their
situation was the same. Just 12 percent said they were doing worse.
   Seventy-three percent overall said they were saving for the
future. But the market was not a preferred choice for saving:
Seventy percent said they had no money in stocks, and 71 percent
saw the market as risky.
   Among the wealthiest Americans, those making $50,000 or more a
year, more than half had money in the market. But even in this
group, 71 percent said they regarded the stock market as a risky
investment.
   Even though three in 10 overall had stock investments, only 6
percent said the crash had a major impact on their lives, and only
15 percent said it had a moderate impact, for a total of 21 percent.
   By contrast, 28 percent said the market crash had little impact
on their lives and 47 percent said it had no impact at all _ a
total of 75 percent. Even among the wealthiest, 69 percent felt
little or no impact.
   On the outlook for the market, 33 percent said there was a good
chance of another crash in the next year or two and 26 percent were
unsure. The plurality, 41 percent, said another crash was ``not too
likely'' soon.
   The poll did not find broad support for greater government
regulation of Wall Street. While a quarter favored it, four in 10
said current oversight was sufficient and 9 percent wanted less
regulation. The rest were unsure.
   The poll, conducted Sept. 6-14, had a margin of error of plus or
minus three percentage points.

<TEXT>
   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews Sept. 6-14 with 1,125 adults in the
continental United States. The phone numbers were selected randomly
by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult who had
the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if
every adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be within plus or minus three points of the
poll's results, 19 times out of 20.
   The margin of error is higher for subgroups _ seven points, for
example, for respondents earning $50,000 or more a year.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, some totals are not
exactly 100:
   1. Overall, do you think the United States economy is going to
turn worse in the next few years, or improve, or stay about the
same? Worse: 25 percent. Improve: 21. Same: 43. Don't know-no
answer: 10.
   2. Regardless of how you may vote in the presidential election,
which candidate do you think would do a better job of managing the
economy _ George Bush, or Michael Dukakis? Bush: 50. Dukakis: 34.
DK-NA: 16.
   3. How would you rate your family's personal economic situation
right now _ are you very well off, or doing all right, or just
getting by, or are you in hard times financially? Well off: 9. All
right: 57. Getting by: 29. Hard times: 5. DK-NA: 2.
   4. Compared to a year ago, is your family's financial situation
better today, or worse today, or about the same? Better: 32. Worse:
12. Same: 56. DK-NA: 1.
   5. In the next few years, do you expect your family's financial
situation to get better, or worse, or stay about the same? Better:
55. Worse: 6. Same: 33. DK-NA: 5.
   6. Are you saving for the future, or not? Yes: 73. No: 26.
DK-NA: 2.
   7. Do you have any money in the stock market? Yes: 29. No: 70.
DK-NA: 1.
   8. Overall, do you think the stock market is a safe investment,
or a risky one? Safe: 16. Risky: 71. DK-NA: 12.
   9. The stock market crashed about a year ago. Would you say the
market crash had a major impact on your life, or a moderate impact,
or a little impact, or no impact at all? Major: 6. Moderate: 15.
Little: 28. None: 47. DK-NA: 4.
   10. Are you being more cautious with your money now than you
were a year ago? Yes: 63. No: 34. DK-NA: 3.
   11. What do you think are the chances of another stock market
crash in the next year or two _ would you say there's a good chance
of another crash, or do you think another crash is not too likely?
Good chance: 33. Not too likely: 41. DK-NA: 26.
   12. Do you think there should be more government regulation of
the stock market, less regulation, or should government regulation
of the stock market stay as it is? More: 24. Less: 9. Same: 40.
DK-NA: 27.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a glossary of some frequently used terms
related to the stock market:
   BARGAIN HUNTERS: Investors looking to buy shares at reduced
prices in a period of market decline.
   CIRCUIT BREAKERS: A post-crash reform proposal to temporarily
halt trading of stocks and futures contracts when prices plummet.
   COMPUTERIZED PROGRAM TRADING: A computer-run strategy enabling
big institutional investors to make lightning-quick trades of huge
amounts of stocks, stock index futures and options on index futures
in attempts to profit from price disparities.
   DIVIDEND: A payment made to shareholders of a corporation from
earnings, payable at a fixed rate on preferred shares and at a
varying rate, according to the size of profits, on common shares.
   DOW JONES AVERAGE: Refers to the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks, a closely watched barometer of blue-chip issues.
   GREAT CRASH: The stock market collapse that occurred on ``Black
Monday,'' Oct. 28, 1929, when the Dow Jones average dropped 12.8
percent. The historic event helped trigger the Depression of the
1930s.
   INDEX ARBITRAGE: The purchase of a stock-index future in one
market and sale of the stocks that comprise that index in another
market, or vice versa, in order to profit from temporary price
differences in the two markets. Index arbitrage is the most widely
used form of computerized program trading.
   MARGIN ACCOUNT: A credit line enabling an investor to speculate
in the market with shares bought with borrowed money that is backed
by collateral such as the investor's stock holdings. Under Federal
Reserve regulations, investors may borrow up to 50 percent of the
value of a stock purchase. When the value of an investor's
collateral falls below the amount of money the investor has
borrowed to buy stock, a brokerage firm will make a ``margin call''
requiring the investor t put up more collateral or face the forced
sale of the stock.
   MUTUAL FUND: An organization that invests the money of its
shareholders in a diversified group of securities of other
corporations.
   OPTION: An agreement, usually for a fee, which permits an
investor to buy or sell a stock or a stock index future within a
specified time period in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
   PORTFOLIO INSURANCE: A strategy in which investors sell options
or futures against the underlying stock in a portfolio to offset
price declines and enhance price increases.
   SHORT SELLING: The practice of selling borrowed securities,
expecting to be able to buy them later at a lower price before
having to return them to the lender.
   STOCK: The permanently invested capital of a corporation
contributed by the owners when the corporation is organized and
then divided into shares, each representing a proportionate
ownership in the company. Common stock enjoys an exclusive claim to
net assets and profits of a corporation if no other class of stock
is issued. Preferred stock, when issued, takes precedence over
common stock according to specified terms.
   STOCK INDEX FUTURES: Contracts that allow investors to buy and
sell theoretical packages of stocks for delivery at a future date.
   TRADING HALT: A measure designed to check a steep slide in the
stock market.
   VOLATILITY: Wild price swings in stock trading.
   YIELD: The difference between the purchase price and the face
value of a security.

   Last year's stock market crash decimated the
hopes of nearly half the companies waiting to go public and reduced
the amount of cash others could raise in the equity market, a study
released today said.
   Of the 229 businesses on file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Oct. 19, 1987 to issue stock for the first time, 45
percent had abandoned those plans nine months after ``Black
Monday,'' according to the accounting and consulting firm Grant
Thornton.
   ``The number of busted (initial public offerings) we identified
is unprecedented,'' said Chet Borgida, director of the firm's
capital markets group and head of the study.
   ``We all knew that going public was tougher after Black Monday.
We just didn't know how tough.''
   Fewer than 25 percent of the companies planning to go public
were able to do so since the crash, the study showed. Another 31
percent still were on file with the SEC to go public as of July 31.
   Those companies that braved the equities market succeeded in
raising an average $15.9 million. But Grant Thornton estimated that
each of those same companies would have raised an average of $7.2
million more had they completed their public offerings before the
crash.
   Small and mid-sized companies were most severely affected,
Borgida said. ``Most of the companies that wanted to go public
couldn't, and those that did had to settle for less capital than
they needed.''
   Of 51 companies that participated in a Grant Thornton poll, 27
said they had obtained financing from alternative sources including
commercial banks, private placements and, less frequently, from
venture capitalists.
   Despite the grim environment, 86 percent of the companies
participating in the poll _ including half of the businesses that
withdrew their initial public offerings _ said they would
considering going public if they could make the choice again.
   ``As least in the view of America's entrepreneurs, there is no
substitute for going public,'' Borgida said. ``Even in this most
difficult year for financing, companies still believe that they can
raise the greatest amount of capital most efficiently through the
public equity markets.''

   Australian brewers Elders IXL Ltd. launched a
takeover bid Monday for Scottish and Newcastle PLC, valuing the
British brewer at the equivalent of $2.8 billion.
   Elders, through its Courage Holdings PLC subsidiary, is offering
400 pence, or $7 a share in cash for the Scottish-based drinks
company best known for its Newcastle brown ale.
   The Australian company, which makes the popular Fosters brand
lager, said it already owns 9.65 percent of Scottish and
Newcastle's share capital.
   Following the announcement, Scottish and Newcastle stock shot
above the Elders offer price in London to 426 pence from Friday's
closing price of 351 pence.
   Elders already owns Courage, one of the best-known names in
British beer, which it bought in 1986 for 1.4 billion pounds.
   It also owns 13.5 percent of Greene King, another British
brewer, and just under 1 percent of the American company
Anheuser-Busch, the world's biggest brewer.
   Elders is best known for its beer and lager, but it also has a
financial services company and interests in agriculture and mining.

<HEAD>Finance Minister Appologizes Over Stock Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's finance minister apologized Monday in
Parliament for his involvement in an insider stock trading scandal
that has provoked a major debate over political ethics and delayed
passage of a controversial tax bill.
   Responding to questioning by opposition parties, Kiichi Miyazawa
said he was unaware a former aide, Tsuneo Hattori, had allowed a
friend to buy 10,000 shares of Recruit-Cosmos Co. stock in
Miyazawa's name.
   Miyazawa, the first Cabinet minister linked directly to the
Recruit-Cosmos scandal, did not offer to resign but expressed
regret for his involvement.
   ``I was truly careless,'' Miyazawa said. ``I'm sorry for failing
to supervise well.''
   Parliament remained stalemated Monday by opposition demands for
a full investigation into the Recruit-Cosmos scandal. Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, also said he had been ``careless.'' But
he described the scandal as part of a larger problem arising from
laws regulating financial dealings, tax administration and
political ethics.
   Several senior politicians reportedly obtained shares in the
real estate company in 1984 before the stock was offered to the
public. The stock nearly quadrupled in value shortly after it was
listed on the over-the-counter market, and the politicians made up
to $780,000 each in profits.
   Miyazawa admitted in Parliament last week that his aides had
bought the shares in his name, reversing earlier denials of his
involvement. But he said he had no previous knowledge of the
dealings.
   Last week, the Japan Communist Party released a list of nine
people, including Miyazawa, who allegedly purchased the shares
through a financial firm linked to Recruit-Cosmos. The list also
included aides to Prime Minister Takeshita, former Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone and Shintaro Abe, secretary general of the
governing Liberal Democratic Party.
   The dealings raised serious ethical questions but broke no laws
in Japan, where companies have routinely given politicians stock
certain to increase in value as political contributions. Parliament
has since tightened laws involving such transactions, but the
legislation is not retroactive.

   Stock prices were mixed today, marking time in
an atmosphere of continuing caution.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials inched ahead 1.42 to
2,134.60 in the first half hour of trading.

   Stock prices edged upward in quiet trading

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures were mostly lower in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting
pessimism about grain sales to the Soviet Union and an increase in
crop sales by farmers.
   But early losses were slight due to the supportive influence of
weekend rains in the Midwest and relatively dry growing conditions
in Brazil and Argentina, which are large producers of soybeans,
analysts said.
   ``Their situation is improving down there, but they still need
rain,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader in Chicago with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The weekend rain in the Midwest slowed the U.S. corn and soybean
harvest, which is more than half complete, Lespinasse said. More
rain was expected today and Wednesday.
   On Friday, negotiators for the United States and the Soviet
Union ended two days of talks in London without a new long-term
grain agreement. Disappointment over the failure to produce an
agreement continued to weigh on the markets today, Lespinasse said.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 2} cents lower with
December at $4.26 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1\ cents lower
with December at $2.93 a bushel; oats were 2{ cents lower across
the board with December at $2.50 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to
3{ cents lower with November at $8.02 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were mostly lower
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .18 cent lower to .05 cent higher with October
at 72.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent lower to .18
cent higher with October at 82.05 cents a pound; hogs were
unchanged to .30 cent lower with October at 40.25 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .02 cent to .30 cent lower with February
at 48.80 cents a pound.
   Cattle finished mostly lower on Friday while pork futures were
mixed.

<BYLINE>Saudis Hope To Curb Outflux of Petrodollars
^By DONNA FENN HEINTZEN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabians, fewer petrodollars
in their pockets and worried about security and culture shock, have
started looking for holidays at home and finding there is more to
the country than sand.
   In the oil price heyday of the 1970s, Saudi Moslems flocked to
the kingdom's air terminals to escape the heat and monotony of the
desert for the great tourist capitals _ Paris, London, New York and
Los Angeles, the French and Spanish Rivieras, Istanbul and Cairo.
   But local tourism has been on the rise for the past five years,
spearheaded by a government campaign to encourage Saudis to spend
their vacation dollars at home.
   ``There are quite a lot of religiously conservative families who
suffer when they go abroad,'' said Ibrahim al-Sayed,
director-general of tourism development in the country's
mountainous southwest Asir region. ``They don't want their
teen-agers to copy Westerners.''
   He added that many Saudis are also acutely aware that language
and cultural barriers make them attractive victims for con artists
abroad.
   ``I've traveled in Europe and I've faced some of the troubles,''
said Fahd al-Sayejh, public relations manager at the Riyadh
Intercontinental Hotel.
   ``My family's now looking for a villa in Abha. There are many
people who spend their summers there who used to go to Europe.''
   Abha is in the cooler, mountainous province of Asir in southwest
Saudi Arabia.
   He added: ``In the oil boom years, businessmen thought nothing
of driving to the airport and boarding any available international
flight. Now people are more aware of spending their money.''
   Tourism within Saudi Arabia may seem like a hard sell, given the
country's reputation as a ``desert kingdom,'' lacking much in the
way of amusement.
   But beaches in the country's Eastern Province on the gulf draw
big crowds.
   Jiddah on the Red Sea attracts scuba diving enthusiasts and
Najran, close to Yemen, offers unusual architecture. For a change
of scenery, many tourists try the southwest.
   ``The whole southwest area is very popular,'' said Antoni
Kuhnen, who runs the al-Baha Motel in that region. Kuhnen estimates
that the motel, opened in 1985, now books around 20,000 tourists a
year.
   Al-Baha, Saudi Arabia's smallest province, is situated between
Taif, where the government retreats into the mountains for the
summer months, and Abha, capital of Asir province, which boasts
1,736 square miles of national park.
   ``It's beautiful,'' said al-Sayejh. ``It reminds us of the old
days when we used to go to Lebanon every summer. The mountains are
the same.''
   A local newspaper noted that ``visitors to the Abha region
reached an unprecedented number, to the extent that the real estate
offices in Abha cannot cope with the great demand for furnished and
unfurnished flats.''
   An estimated 800,000 visitors were reported to have made it
despite a relatively small airport.
   The recent popularity of in-country tourism is due largely to
the government. Five years ago, the few tourists who came to
al-Baha and Abha had to either camp out or rely on the kindness of
strangers for accommodation.
   Now, there are five hotels in the area, some of them bankrolled
by the Finance Ministry. Private businessmen are also being
encouraged to invest in tourism.
   ``As long as the facilities are there, the tourists will come,''
said Kuhnen, who nonetheless feels the region suffers for lack of
recreational diversions.
   An amusement park would make al-Baha more attractive to Saudi
families who generally have large numbers of children to entertain,
he said. Land has already been allocated, but awaits an investor.
   Al-Baha does not lack scenic beauty. At nearly 10,000 feet above
sea level, the air is cool, crisp, and a bit damp _ a welcome
change from just about any place else in the kingdom during the
summer months.
   The mountains, rough, craggy, and dotted with scrubby green
plants, rise dramatically out of the Tihama Valley and are
populated by shepherds tending flocks of sheep and goats.
   Baboons lope down the mountainside, carrying scraps of food fed
to them by motel staff and early-rising guests.
   The historically minded tourist can retrace the Taif-Abha leg of
the ancient frankincense route, which originally started in
southern Oman and ended in Jordan.
   To the government, promoting internal tourism means more than
just providing its citizens with vacation options. At a recent
symposium on drugs, development of internal tourism was cited as
one way to discourage youth from traveling abroad and encountering
drug users and sellers.
   Newspapers frequently warn readers of the ``travails of foreign
travel,'' citing examples of how unsuspecting Saudis are cheated.

reported Monday.
   Last week's count had declined by four to total 914. A year ago,
the count was 1,134, Baker Hughes announced Monday.
   The rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling
activity and reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil
as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.
   Among major oil producing states, the big gainers were Oklahoma
with 10, Wyoming with six and Texas with five. New Mexico's count
increased by three and Colorado gained one more rig.
   The losers included Ohio, which lost five, California, which
lost four and Louisiana, which was down by three. Michigan's count
was down by two, while North Dakota and Kansas each lost one.

   Stock prices were little changed in quiet
trading today, getting little benefit from new evidence of a
slowing economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped .89 to 2,132.29
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 610 up, 600 down and 563
unchanged.
   Analysts said traders took a generally upbeat view of the
current state of the economy, believing that growth hasasonable basis.''
   Lawyers for the Securities and Exchange Commission had contested
Drexel's motion to remove Pollack.
   ``I think the judge's opinion was in accordance with our legal
position,'' said Barry Goldsmith, an SEC deputy litigation counsel
who is handling the day-to-day affairs of the Drexel case. ``Right
now we're looking forward to getting on with the merits of the
case.''
   Attorneys for others who have sued Drexel and Boesky also
applauded the ruling of Pollack, who is widely known as a
no-nonsense judge who often rules in the government's favor in
white-collar fraud cases.
   ``I am delighted by the decision,'' said David Berger, a lead
attorney for shareholders that have filed a class action suit
against Drexel and Boesky. He described the defense effort to
disqualify Pollack as ``just a litigation ploy, an attempt to stall
the evil day.''
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said in a statement: ``Our
attorneys had a professional obligation to bring this issue before
the court. Since it is their considered view that, based on the
facts in the motion, Judge Pollack's position is incorrect, the
matter will be placed before the 2nd circuit Court of Appeals.''
   The SEC filed a civil suit against Drexel, its high-yield bond
financier Michael Milken and three other employees of the firm
Sept. 7, alleging they schemed with Boesky to profit on insider
trading, manipulate stock, cheat Drexel clients and commit other
frauds.
   The defendants denied the allegations. Up to now the case has
largely been stalled over disputes about Pollack's impartiality and
pretrial evidence requests by both sides.

   Some housing and real estate folks are prepared
to quash any attempts to lessen the tax deduction of home mortgage
interest, suggesting that such efforts would be an attack on the
American dream itself.
   Others in the industry, however, question the threat to home
ownership, mainly because the current indebtedness cap _ the limit
on mortgage interest that may be deducted from taxes _ is $1
million.
   In their view, an allowance of that size benefits very few
Americans and, as a corollary, provides a huge tax deduction for a
privileged few _ one that may have very little to do with providing
shelter.
   The issue is controversial even within the industry.
   A commentary by Nestor R. Weigand Jr., president of the National
Association of Realtors, warning that some members of Congress
wished to cut the million-dollar cap, drew both negative and
positive responses.
   Perhaps typical of the negative responses was a letter to the
editor of Realtor News, the association's weekly newspaper, stating
that ``those fortunate enough to own a lavish home do not need the
large tax savings.''
   The most commonly cited reason for opposing any cut in the
deductibility seems to be that one cut might be followed by more,
perhaps even leading to eventual elimination of any deduction of
home mortgage interest.
   Defending that stand, another letter to Realtor News cautioned
that when Congress is thwarted in attempts to raise taxes, members
``could merely lower the cap on the mortgage interest deduction and
then tell their constituents that they were able to stave off any
attempt to raise taxes.''
   Whatever the merits or lack of them, the tax deductiblity has
produced some situations that are difficult to equate with the
promotion of home ownership.
   It can, for example, encourage homeownership as an investment
rather than shelter.
   In one instance, an individual can invest in a home far more
expensive than he or she might have purchased without the
deduction. The purpose: To obtain a maximum mortgage that generates
enough deductions to offset taxes on income.
   Moreover, any increases in the home's value is tax-deferred,
meaning that no tax is paid until the house is sold. The same money
invested in interest-bearing securities would be taxed annually.
   A big mortgage _ perhaps encouraged by the tax deductiblity _
also offers unusual leverage for an investor.
   If, for example, a $1.5 million house is purchased with the
assistance of a million-dollar mortgage, and in a year's time rises
4 percent in value to $1.56 million, the original $500,000 cash
investment has earned 12 percent.
   That $60,000 gain is, of course, tax deferred so long as the
house is not sold. Moreover, the homeowner may obtain an
additional, relatively low cost equity loan up to $100,000 for any
purpose, and deduct all the interest.
   While the issue of the $1 million cap is fairly dormant at the
moment, various proposals have been circulating through Congress,
convincing Weigand and others that sometime next year another
suggestion will be made to cut.
   As they see it, their stand is an effort to defend homeownership.
   As some critics view it, however, the issue is really whether a
house should be a home, or a personal bank instead.

<HEAD>High-Tech Trading Advances Despite Doubts Raised by Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market crash triggered worries about
the destructive effects of computers, but a year later the
high-tech revolution in the financial marketplace is forging ahead
relentlessly, especially outside the United States.
   Moreover, while U.S. policymakers agonize over ``program
trading'' and other high-tech investment tools that may have played
roles in the crash a year ago Wednesday, computer advances abroad
are raising serious questions about the competitiveness of American
financial markets in the 1990s and beyond.
   Such advances, for example, enable U.S. investors to use a
British-owned computerized trading network called Instinet to buy
or sell stocks abroad when domestic markets are closed.
   Elsewhere, from the world's oldest stock exchange in Amsterdam
to the bourses of Paris, Tokyo and Toronto, exchange officials have
replaced order scribblers and floor traders with super-fast
electronic display screens that enable investors of all
nationalities to buy and sell more cheaply.
   ``I'm not sure we're doing anything differently, we're just
doing it faster,'' said Robert Reid, executive vice president of
Instinet, a subsidiary of Reuters Holdings PLC that can
electronically trade stocks in 14 countries. ``All we're doing is
automating that which we've done before.''
   Many experts believe securities markets in general, and American
markets in particular, are in danger of becoming obsolete because
computers have made it so easy to cheaply trade stocks, bonds and
other financial items.
   ``Technology is inevitable,'' said Daniel Siegel, a market
expert and professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg graduate
business school. ``It allows people to communicate and transact
very quickly. That means the role of an exchange is more and more
vague.''
   The implications of this change are profound, Siegel and others
say. For one thing, it means the post-crash era will be marked by
more exotic investing techniques and a need for an even faster flow
of information, rather than a retreat to traditional, conservative
patterns.
   The change also means that the titan New York Stock Exchange,
which still handles most of U.S. stock trading, could face serious
threats to its survival as investors find it more efficient and
cheaper to trade elsewhere.
   ``The NYSE's greatest asset is its building,'' said Richard
Niehoff, president of the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, one of the
first U.S. exchanges to totally automate and bypass the humans who
match buyers with sellers.
   ``Dinosaurs go,'' Niehoff said. ``Over time, I just don't see
the need for (trading) floors. I can see a lot more at a terminal
than I can see at a floor post.''
   Congress, alarmed not only by the market weaknesses during the
crash but by the role computers will play in the future, has
ordered a major study into the relationship between technology and
the securities industry. Conducted by the Office of Technology
Assessment, it is expected to be done by December 1989.
   The NYSE, also sensing a threat, is aggressively expanding its
own computer capacity to handle enormous volumes, from 250 million
shares a day in 1984 to 600 million a day this year and 1 billion
daily in the next decade.
   The exchange also has tinkered with other innovations that it
says will enhance the ability of its market makers, known as
specialists, to price stocks fairly and trade them efficiently,
keys to any stock market's success.
   Critics say the NYSE's efforts, in the long run, are a futile
attempt to preserve dominance of the specialists in a world they no
longer can control. Some liken the exchange's use of computers to
an ultra-modern telephone system in which all calls must still be
placed through human operators.
   Other U.S. financial markets have taken a markedly different
approach to the future, acknowledging the inevitability of 24-hour
automated trading and the possible exodus of American investment
business overseas.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, for example, plans a joint
venture with Reuters for an electronic network, called Globex,
allowing all-night trading of currency futures and options and
interest-rate futures on Treasury bills.
   ``If the Merc closes down at night and allows Tokyo and London
to establish markets in its commodities, it might decline faster,''
said Paul Tattersall, executive vice president for Globex, which
intends to start by next summer.
   The U.S. securities industry's differing approaches to
technology in the post-crash era have alarmed some experts, who say
a strong and unified stand is crucial.
   ```If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' is the cry of too many
industry leaders today,'' Junius W. Peake, a capital-markets
consultant and founder of Bermuda-based Intex, the first fully
electronic exchange, told a recent New York conference on market
technology. ``Just because something works doesn't mean that it
isn't approaching obsolescence or is actually obsolete.''

<HEAD>Kodak Planning First Manufacturing Facility in Japan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. announced plans Monday
to open its first manufacturing plant in Japan, a move that could
be viewed as a tit for tat with rival Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.
   Kodak expects to open its finishing and packaging facility for
certain graphic arts films by the end of the year, said company
spokesman Ron Roberts. It is in Yokohama and will initially employ
10 workers.
   ``There may be some thought that this will send a message to
Fuji that if they do more in the U.S., Kodak will do more in
Japan,'' said Peter Enderlin, a stock analyst with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   Kodak's announcement comes 10 days after Fuji held
groundbreaking ceremonies for its first manufacturing plant in the
United States, said Fuji spokeswoman Carol O'Laughlin.
   That plant, located in Greenwood, S.C., will also make products
for the graphic arts industry. It will employ about 150 people and
be about seven times larger than Kodak's facility.
   Roberts said Kodak's decision to open a plant in Japan had
nothing to do with Fuji or any other competitor.
   ``This is not a reaction to that. The two are not related,''
said Roberts. ``Our decision is a business decision, a response to
what we see in the market.''
   Roberts said Kodak is opening the plant, which will cut and
package huge rolls of the company's film shipped in from Rochester,
to become more efficient in making several graphic arts products
that come in sizes unique to the Japanese market.
   Enderlin said the primary reason Kodak is planning to open a
plant in Japan is most likely to take advantage of currency
fluctuations between the dollar and the yen.
   Eugene Glazer, an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New
York, said it was clear that the small plant is ``the forerunner of
a greater effort'' and a way for Kodak to try out running a
manufacturing operation in Japan.
   ``It will also keep Fuji nervous, keep Fuji on its toes in
Japan,'' Glazer said.
   Analysts also said the Japanese manufacturing facility also
continues Kodak's increased emphasis in Japan, where the company
recently opened a large research and development facility.
   Kodak also has introduced its new ``Ektar'' line of color film
for serious amateur photographers in Japan before putting it on
shelves in the United States.

<HEAD>Court Refuses To Block Vaccine Lawsuit in Virginia Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $10 million lawsuit against the maker of a
whooping cough vaccine that allegedly caused brain damage in an
infant should go to trial, the Supreme Court ruled Monday.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling in a Virginia
case that federal law does not foreclose such suits under state
regulations that protect consumers against defectively designed
products, even if the federal government approves the products.
   In other business-related cases, the justices:
   _Refused to hear an appeal by Hallmark Cards Inc. of an
injunction barring it from selling greeting cards resembling those
produced by Blue Mountain Arts, a small company in Colorado.
   _Agreed to consider allowing states to give larger retirement
benefits to public employees forced to quit work before age 60. The
case involves an Ohio pension law provision that gave a 61-year-old
state employee lower disability retirement benefits than she would
have gotten if she had been younger.
   _Agreed to hear a Reagan administration appeal aimed at making
it easier for the government to conduct tax-fraud investigations.
The justices said they will use a California case involving the
Church of Scientology to settle a dispute over the power of the
Internal Revenue Service to obtain and use confidential documents.
   The vaccine case involves Tracy Abbot, who was 5 months old in
August 1983 when she was inoculated with a vaccine called
Tri-Immunol manufactured by Lederle Laboratories, a division of
American Cyanamid Co.
   Her mother sued Lederle in 1986 charging the vaccine caused
brain damage in Tracy and asking $10 million in damages.
   Tri-Immunol is a vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and
whooping cough _ or pertussis _ and is administered to millions of
children without serious side effects. But it has caused serious
injury in a small number of children.
   The vaccine is approved by the federal Food and Drug
Administration and other government health agencies. Only one other
company in the United States is licensed to produce a whooping
cough vaccine.
   Whooping cough claimed thousands of lives before the vaccine was
developed. The most serious U.S. epidemic was in 1934 when there
were 265,000 reported cases and 7,500 deaths.
   The Abbot suit contends Tri-Immunol is ``unreasonably
dangerous'' and says Lederle failed to develop a safer vaccine even
though other forms of the vaccine have been used outside the United
States.
   A federal judge threw out the suit, but the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals reinstated it in April.
   The appeals court rejected arguments that the federal
government's interest in promoting use of the vaccine would be
frustrated by permitting suits alleging violation of state
regulations. Federal law does not pre-empt such suits, the appeals
court said.
   In a somewhat related issue, the Supreme Court ruled in June
that the government may be forced to pay damages when a vaccine it
licenses causes the disease it was intended to prevent. That case
reinstated a suit in behalf of a boy who contracted polio after
receiving a dose of federally approved vaccine.
   The Reagan administration has not announced a position on the
Abbot suit. But the Justice Department has pointed out that
alternative vaccines to the type Lederle produces have not been
proven safe and effective.
   Congress has passed a law, which took full effect Oct. 1,
creating a fund to help compensate children injured by vaccines.
The new law places a tax on some vaccines to provide funds for
injuries that occur from vaccinations after 1986.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to wet
weather in the Corn Belt, dry conditions in South America and new
wheat demand from China.
   Showers slowed the rapid harvest pace in the Midwest, where corn
and soybean gathering is approaching completion. Forecasters
predicted more rain on Wednesday, which sparked additional buying.
   Soybean prices received an additional boost from reports of
lighter-than-expected weekend rains in the soybean-growing regions
of Brazil and Argentina.
   ``The situation has improved down there, there's no doubt about
that, but they're not out of the woods yet. They need more rain,''
said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The wheat market rallied on news that China had submitted a bid
for 280,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat, he said.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 4 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.30{ a bushel; corn was \
cent lower to 1\ cents higher with December at $2.95 a bushel; oats
were 1{ cents to 2} cents higher at $2.55\ a bushel; soybeans were
5 cents to 8 cents higher with November at $8.10{ a bushel.

<HEAD>U.N. Says Governments, Private Banks Must Slash Debt Of Third
World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Governments and private lenders must write
off part of the Third World's debt if they hope to see those
nations recover from economic stagnation, Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar said in a report released Monday.
   Perez de Cuellar is scheduled Wednesday to address the U.N.
committee dealing with the world debt crisis, and the committee's
resolution will go to the floor of the General Assembly for debate.
   In introducing the secretary-general's report, Jean Ripert, head
of the U.N.'s office of Development and International Economic
Cooperation, said that ``the service of their debt is killing
investment in these (developing) countries.''
   ``The report before you relates the debt problem squarely to the
current crisis of development in a large part of the world,''
Ripert said. ``Lack of finance, low commodity prices, high interest
rates, severe protectionism are leading to substantive net transfer
of resources from developing and debtor nations to the developed
countries.
   ``If the present trends continue, the debt crisis will remain an
obstacle to growth in the indebted countries for at least another
decade.''
   Writing off debt, unthinkable in the financial community a year
ago, ``is no more a taboo'' since the seven major industrial
democracies advocated forgiving part of Africa's debt at their
summit in Toronto last summer, according to the report.
   The secretary-general's report notes the so-called ``moral
hazard'' of forgiving debts if that leads to new borrowing, but
notes that ``politicians are not generally considered successful by
their constituents if they need an international rescue.''
   If the 15 most indebted developing countries received
forgiveness of 30 percent of their private bank debt or interest
payments due, about $10 billion would be available for
growth-producing investment, the report says.
   Those 15 countries are Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ecuador, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru,
Philippines, Uruguay, Venezuela and Yugoslavia, which together owe
about $300 billion to commercial banks.
   Developing nations owed a total of about $1.2 trillion to
governments and commercial lenders at the end of 1987.
   Much of the new investment ``could be expected to be channelled
into imports of capital goods from developed market-economy
countries,'' benefiting their economies, says the report.
   The report estimates that those orders would boost the economies
of the developed countries by about 1 percent of their industrial
output.
   Governments in developed countries should also forgive debt owed
to them as a result of foreign aid loans, the report says.
   The secretary-general's report was prepared with analysis by the
U.N. Conference on Trade and Development in consultation with
leading financiers.

   A consortium of West German banks
on Monday signed a $1.6 billion credit agreement for the Soviet
Union.
   Deutsche Bank AG, West Germany's largest commercial bank which
is heading the consortium, said it signed the agreement with
Moscow's Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs.
   The bank in May announced it was heading an effort to extend the
credit to the Soviets to boost their consumer goods production and

exports aimed at expansion and modernization of the Soviet consumer
goods industry, notably the food, leather, textile and clothing
sectors.
   The agreement will be finalized with another signing ceremony
scheduled for Oct. 24 in Moscow, when Chancellor Helmut Kohl
arrives in the Soviet capital for an official visit.
   Separately, the West German Economics Ministry said it was
encouring German companies to seek more joint ventures with Soviet
enterprises as a means of boosting economic relations.
   Trade between West Germany and the Soviet Union dropped to $8.3
billion in 1987 from $10.30 billion in 1986, but the Economics
Ministry said total trade volume is expected to stabilize this year.

<HEAD>U.S. Supreme Court Refuses To Hear Hallmark Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday without comment refused to hear
Hallmark Cards Inc.'s appeal of an injunction that bars it from
making and distributing greeting cards at issue in a lawsuit filed
by a small Colorado firm.
   The ruling is the latest development in the legal dispute
between Hallmark, the Kansas City, Mo.-based greeting card giant,
and tiny Blue Mountain Arts of Boulder.
   At the center of the dispute is Blue Mountain's contention that
Hallmark copied a line of cards featuring watercolor decorations
and long free-verse poetry.
   Hallmark contends the market should be open to competing
versions of the cards. Blue Mountain, on the other hand, is bent on
protecting what it believes is a unique creation.
   ``This legal battle is emotionally draining and is tiring us
out, but we are strongly committed to this fight for artists'
rights,'' Bob Gall, general manager of Blue Mountain Arts, said.
   Blue Mountain Arts had filed a lawsuit against Hallmark accusing
the company of copying the cards. The case is scheduled to go to
trial Jan. 2 in Denver U.S. District Court.
   ``Given the procedural precedents, this action was not
unexpected,'' said Steve Doyal, Hallmark's corporate media
relations manager, in reaction to the Supreme Court's move.
   Hallmark has denied the ``copycat'' allegations, and it
challenged a November 1986 injunction imposed by Denver federal
Judge Jim Carrigan that prohibits Hallmark from producing and
distributing the cards. Hallmark has since stopped printing the 83
cards in question, said Doyal.
   Hallmark attorneys had said the injunction gives Blue Mountain a
monopoly on such cards that is ``unlimited in time and scope.'' But
with the Supreme Court's refusal to hear the appeal, the injunction
will stand.
   ``The legal issues now to be tried concerns whether any card
company should have the right to create a monopoly simultaneously
with an artist's completed work product,'' said Doyal. ``While such
a legal policy would ultimately benefit Hallmark, given our size
and creative staff, it would actually stifle the viability of small
companies such as Blue Mountain.''

   Financier Carl Icahn and leaders of ailing
Eastern Airlines' unions have reached an impasse in their talks on
a joint takeover offer for Eastern, sources close to the
discussions said Monday.
   Icahn, the chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., met with the
union leaders over the weekend, said the sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The talks broke down mainly because Icahn
was seeking wage concessions from the Eastern unions that the union
leaders considered too severe, the sources told The Associated
Press.
   In addition, a source close to Eastern said no further meetings
between Icahn and the unions had been scheduled.
   According to a report in Monday's editions of the New York
Times, Icahn planned to meet _ possibly Monday _ with Frank
Lorenzo, the chairman of Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent. Lorenzo
has said publicly that Icahn recently approached him about a
possible bid for Miami-based Eastern.
   Lorenzo has given Icahn an exclusive right until the end of the
week to make an offer for Eastern to the Texas Air board of
directors, the Times said, quoting unnamed sources. After that
deadline, other interested parties could come forward 1.7498  .5757

<TEXT>
   Hopes appeared to fade on Monday for an
agreement to end a computer industry split over the future of Unix,
a base layer of software that makes it easier for different brands
of computers to communicate.
   The fight over Unix has dismayed computer users, who are left
undecided about which rival version of Unix they should adopt as
their own. Programs that work with one version of Unix may not work
with the other.
   Several companies involved in the high-stakes tussle are
planning to issue a statement Tuesday rallying around American
Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s version of Unix, the weekly trade
newspaper Computerworld said in Monday's editions.
   Such a group would be a rival to the Open Software Foundation,
which includes such giants as International Business Machines
Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
   Although AT&T invented Unix, members of the Open Software
Foundation say its development should be controlled by an
industrywide organization so AT&T does not have an unfair advantage
with it.
   AT&T has said it will not join the Open Software Foundation
unless it uses AT&T's version of Unix as the core of a new
operating system. But the foundation is sticking with plans to use
IBM software as the core.
   Robert Kavner, president of AT&T's Data Systems Group, told
Computerworld that AT&T and 10 other companies will form a group to
develop jointly future versions of Unix.
   AT&T spokesman Dick Muldoon confirmed the accuracy of the
article, although he said Kavner has denied that the new group is
intended to counter the influence of the rival Open Software
Foundation.
   Kavner would not identify the companies that would belong to the
new Unix group, but said candidates would include Unisys Corp., NCR
Corp., Amdahl Corp., Ing. C. Olivetti & Co. SpA, Sun Microsystems
Inc., Fujitsu America Inc. and others.
   NCR spokesman Kelly Kramer said there were tentative plans for
some kind of joint statement by several companies on Tuesday. He
said he did not know what it might say.

<HEAD>Upjohn's Profit Up 20 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Upjohn Co. reported a 20 percent rise in
its third-quarter profit from a year earlier, due largely to an
increase in foreign sales and favorable foreign-exchange rates.
   The pharmaceutical company said Monday that its net income in
the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to $89.6 million, or 49 cents
a share, from $74.6 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter sales were up 7 percent, to $651.8 million from
$608.5 million.
   Foreign sales, which account for 39 percent of Upjohn's total
sales, jumped 14 percent in the quarter while U.S. sales rose only
3 percent. The continued slide in the dollar against other major
currencies made Upjohn's products cheaper and more competitive
overseas.
   Upjohn said its Rogaine anti-baldness formula led its major
products in foreign sales growth.
   Rogaine was approved Aug. 17 for marketing in the United States
and is expected to contribute to continued foreign and domestic
gains, Chairman Theodore Cooper said.
   Rogaine now is sold in more than 50 countries including Canada,
where it is called Regaine.
   ``But the U.S. approval was critical to realizing the product's
full potential,'' Cooper said.
   Upjohn announced last week that Rogaine was available in
pharmacies for men whose doctors prescribe it. The company said it
was briefing physicians on the product in preparation for a public
promotional campaign.
   Upjohn also reported third-quarter sales gains for its Xanax and
Halcion central nervous system agents and its Micronase oral
antidiabetes medication.
   A 19 percent increase in sales of agricultural items, including
animal health products and seed, also helped sales, the company
said.
   In the first nine months of the year, net income rose 17 percent
_ to $272.8 million, or $1.47 a share, from $234.1 million, or
$1.25 a share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month sales grew 9 percent, to $2.04 billion from $1.87
billion.

   Insurance officials in California and
Illinois have given their approval for Batus Inc. to acquire
Farmers Group Inc., the companies said in a joint announcement
Monday.
   The statement said affirmative action was taken by California
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespiee and Illinois Insurance
Director John Washburn.
   Batus and Farmers, a California insurance company, announced
Aug. 24 that they had entered into an agreement providing for Batus
to acquire Farmers at a price of $75 per share in cash, or about
$5.2 billion.
   Arizona, Idaho and Washington ruled favorably on the plan
earlier but it still must be accepted by four other states.

   Stock prices struggled to a small gain in quiet
trading today, aided by new evidence of a slowing economy.
   Analysts said traders took a generally upbeat view of the
current state of the economy, believing that growth has slowed of
late to a steady, sustainable pace.
   Those hopes drew some fresh support from government statistics
issued this morning that showed a drop in capacity use in September.
   But inflation worries haven't been entirely snuffed out on Wall
Street, and brokers said investors were looking ahead warily to
Friday's scheduled report on the consumer price index for September.
   Furthermore, just about all market-watchers agree, stocks are
likely to be a tough product to sell all week with the anniversary
Wednesday of last fall's crash, and all the attendant publicity.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Chase Manhattan Corp., the nation's second-largest banking
company, on Monday reported its third-quarter profit jumped 25
percent, while earnings rose 6.6 percent at No. 4-ranked J.P.
Morgan & Co. and 80 percent at First Chicago Corp., the nation's
11th-largest banker.
   Chase said it earned $283 million, or $3.09 a share, during the
three months ended Sept. 30, up from $226 million, or $2.55 a
share, in the same period a year earlier.
   For the first three quarters of 1988, Chase said it had earnings
of $784 million, or $8.62 per share, compared with a loss of $1.05
billion for the same period last year. The results for the 1987
period included a second-quarter charge of $1.6 billion to cover
shaky Third World debt.
   Morgan said its third-quarter net income totaled $233.6 million,
or $1.25 a share, up from earnings of $219.2 million, or $1.18 a
share, in the same period a year ago.
   For the first nine months, the company had a profit of $743.7
million, or $4 a share, compared with a $140.8 million loss in the
same period of 1987. The year-earlier results included an $875
million loan-loss provision similar to those taken by Chase and
other major banks.
   First Chicago said its third-quarter profit jumped 80 percent,
to $111.1 million, or $1.73 per share, from $61.8 million, or $1.05
a share, in the same period of 1987.
   For the nine-month period, First Chicago earned a record $375.8
million, or $6.13 a share, compared with a $474.2 million loss last
in the first nine months of last year, when it added $855 million
to its loan-loss reserves.
   Chase said its third-quarter earnings included an after-tax gain
of about $103 million from changes in its pension plan. The company
said the results also included higher foreign exchange trading
income, investment banking fees and trading account gains.
   The company reported a decline in net interest income because it
placed about $538 million in credit to Argentine borrowers on
nonaccrual status. That means the bank will no longer include on
its own statements the interest and other charges due on the loans
until the money is actually received.
   Morgan attributed its improved earnings performance partly to
higher non-interest operating income, due largely to foreign
exchange and trading profits, which more than doubled from a year
ago.
   The company's provision for credit losses of $20 million was
unchanged from the 1987 quarter.
   First Chicago said its provision for loan losses declined to $50
million from $75 million a year ago, and that helped improve the
earnings picture in the third quarter.
   ``Our progress ... is shown by the improvement both in capital
ratios and in credit quality, where we have the lowest provision
for credit losses in four years,'' Chairman Barry F. Sullivan said
in a statement.

   Sharp Electronics Corp. introduced a laptop
computer on Monday and revealed that it is the source of the
high-quality screens used on a laptop from Compaq Computer Corp.
that was also unveiled Monday.
   The Compaq and Sharp machines are the first laptops capable of a
high standard of graphics display known as VGA, for Video Graphics
Array.
   Compaq said its flat screen was from a Japanese source, but had
declined to say which company. ``We're the ones,'' said Sharp
spokesman Ted Smits.
   Compaq says companies that use the same flat screen it uses
would not necessarily have as good graphics, because the display
quality also depends on a Compaq-designed chip. The company said it
could not compare its screen with Sharp's because it had not seen
Sharp's yet.
   The machines from Sharp and Compaq are similar in other respects
as well: both weigh 14 pounds and have the same kinds of
microprocessors, main memory, data storage and batteries. Sharp's
suggested price is about $400 lower, at $5,595 for a version with a
40-megabyte hard disk drive.

<TEXT>
   A new, $50 million Nissan
research and development center, planned for operation by 1990,
will design and create a new vehicle for the United States, Nissan
officials said Monday.
   ``If we weren't going to do this next project, then we'd have no
reason to do this research and development,'' Duane Miller, vice
president for design engineering for Nissan Research & Development
Inc. said at a ground breaking for the new center northwest of
Detroit.
   ``Sometime next year, we will begin the next vehicle to be
manufactured in the Tennessee plant,'' Miller said of Nissan Motor
Corp. in U.S.A.'s factory in Smyrna, Tenn., where the company makes
its Sentra cars and light trucks.
   He declined to characterize the new vehicle. The Smyrna plant
has room for another assembly line and enough land for new
factories.
   Also at the ceremony, Takeshi Tanuma, president of the research
and development company, said the center will provide design and
other research work for a minivan to be assembled as a joint
venture between Nissan and Ford Motor Co. and the unspecified
vehicle.
   Tanuma and Miller said the new vehicle would not be exported
from the United States.
   ``Our main objective is to design a car and truck for this
country,'' Tanuma said. He said the decision to put the center in
the Detroit area came because of the number of automotive engineers
in the area.
   Tanuma also said the company was considering putting an engine
plant in the United States, a move some people have seen as
essential to broadening the company's assembly capabilities in the
United States.
   The center, to occupy 200,000 to 250,000 square feet at the site
of a former golf club, will employ about 400 people, three-fourths
of them U.S. citizens, officials said. Construction is to begin
next spring.
   Nissan Research is a joint venture between Nissan Motor Ltd. of
Japan and its U.S. automaker. Nissan Research now has offices in
Ann Arbor and Plymouth, some which will be consolidated at the
center in Farmington Hills.
   Officials said Monday that design work on the new vehicle and
other projects are going on now in Ann Arbor. Nissan operates other
research and development facilities in Tokyo and Newcastle, England.

   Stock prices eked out a modest gain in quiet
trading Monday, aided by new evidence of a slowing economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.29 to 2,140.47.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 749 up, 669
down and 552 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 119.29 million
shares, down from 160.24 million in the previous session and the
lightest total since a 113.72 million-share day on Sept. 28.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 140.82 million shares.
   Analysts said traders took a generally upbeat view of the
current state of the economy, believing that growth has slowed of
late to a steady, sustainable pace.
   Those hopes drew some fresh support from government statistics
issued Monday morning that showed a drop in capacity use in
September.
   But inflation worries haven't been entirely snuffed out on Wall
Street, and brokers said investors were looking ahead warily to
Friday's scheduled report on the consumer price index for September.
   Furthermore, just about all market-watchers agree, investors are
likely to be leery ofstocks all week with the anniversary Wednesday
of last fall's crash, and all the attendant publicity.
   ``As we approach Oct. 19, 1988 it looks to me very little like
Oct. 19, 1987,'' said Edward Kerschner at PaineWebber Inc. in a
bulletin to the firm's brokers and customers.
   ``Nonetheless, absent a loosening of (the Federal Reserve's
credit) policy, the stock market, while not poised for a debacle,
looks vulnerable.''
   Hospital Corp. of America rose } to 49 in active trading. A
special committee of outside directors rejected a $51-a-share
buyout bid by management, asserting that there were other parties
that might be willing to make a higher offer.
   Philip Morris climbed 1] to 100. The company reported
third-quarter earnings of $2.76 a share, up from $2.11 in the
comparable period last year.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included Chrysler, up } at
26[; International Business Machines, up 1] at 121[, and American
Telephone & Telegraph, up [ at 26}.
   Unisys fell 1] to 28| as traders registered their disappointment
over the size of the quarterly earnings gain posted by the company.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $7.13 billion, or 0.26
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .41 to 155.87.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 1.05 to 317.75, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up .91 at 276.41.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
.42 to 385.01. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 303.27, up .72.

   The dollar rose Monday against most major
currencies after reports of intervention by the Bank of Japan
lifted it from its lows of the day.
   Gold prices rose. In late trading, Republic National Bank of New
York said gold was bid at $411.90 a troy ounce, up from $409 an
ounce late Friday.
   The dollar opened lower in Tokyo, but was forced upward by the
Japanese central bank's dollar purchases, traders said.
   After the upward spike in Tokyo, the dollar drifted in uncertain
trading in Europe and the United States, ending the day below its
highs, said Bob Morrissey, senior trader at the Bank of Boston.
   ``The market's still looking for a lower dollar,'' Morrissey
said.
   Speculators were reluctant to try pushing the dollar lower
because larger short positions would make them vulnerable to big
losses in case the dollar shot up, dealers in Europe said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 127.20 yen, up from its opening levels but
down 1.05 yen from Friday. Later, in London, it was quoted at
127.35 yen. At the end of the trading day in New York, the dollar
rose to 127.07 yen from 126.70 yen late Friday.
   The British pound fell against the dollar to $1.7530 from
$1.7550 late Friday. Later in New York, the pound fell to $1.7464
from $1.7598.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Friday's
rates, included 1.8088 West German marks, up from 1.8040; 1.5275
Swiss francs, up from 1.5243; 1.2038 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2048; 6.1710 French francs, down from 6.1765; and 1,346.50
Italian lire, up from 1,344.75.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.8120 West German marks, down from 1.8128; 1.5295 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5305; 6.1790 French francs, down from 6.1945;
2.0390 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0470; 1,348.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,352.50; and 1.2047 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2048.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose 32 cents a troy ounce to close at a bid
$414.06 an ounce. In London, gold traded at $412.25 a troy ounce,
higher than late Friday's $409.10. In Zurich, the late bid was
$412.30 an ounce, up from $408.60 bid late Friday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $412.20 an ounce, up from $409.10 Friday.
   Silver was quoted in London late Monday at a bid price of $6.43
a troy ounce, up from Friday's $6.33. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery rose to $6.405 a troy ounce from
$6.365 an ounce Friday.

   Corning Glass Works more than doubled its
net income in the third quarter to a record $123.9 million from $50
million during the same period last year, the company said Monday.
   Corning Chairman James Houghton said ``the excellent results
came from equity companies as well as strength across the board in
virtually all Corning businesses, where the rate of profitability
was the best we've seen for a third quarter in the last decade.''
   Even without one-time gains of $59 million stemming from
transactions in Japan, the third-quarter results were a company
record.
   On a per-share basis, Corning returned $2.74 compared to $1.08 a
year ago. Sales for quarter totaled $625.4 million, up 2.5 percent
from $610.1 million in the same period a year ago. The company said
the figure was up 11 percent if adjusted for the disposition of the
electronics business in 1987.
   For the 40 weeks ended Oct. 9, the company reported net income
of $243 million, up from $148.5 million, and sales of $1.58
billion, up from $1.54 billion.
   Charles Ryan, analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York, said
Corning's restructuring efforts during the past few years have paid
off. The glass maker based in upstate New York has focused its
research and development in four main areas _ fiber optics and
telecommunications; medical diagnostic services; ceramics and
specialty glasses; and household products.
   Optical fiber sales were modestly improved, according to Stephen
Albertalli, a Corning vice president.
   ``We projected a flat year in the volatile fiber optics
market,'' Albertalli said. ``We're doing a little better than we
expected.''
   The company's clinical testing service subsidiary, MedPath,
Inc., expanded exports to Latin American and Asia and was part of
the reason for a 31 percent increase in income from equity
companies.
   A new manufacturing facility being built by Corning and Asahi
Glass in Osooka, Japan is expected to expand Corning's presence in
the world market for specialty glass. The plant, which is due to
open in 1989, will manufacture glass used in the display modules of
portable computers and other electronic devices.
   The companies household products unit, which manufactures
Corning Glassware, also showed strong sales gains.

<HEAD>Chubb Says $20 Million Issued For Claims On Drought Insurance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARREN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Insurance Co. paid out $20
million for claims on drought insurance it issued to farmers in
seven Midwestern states, its parent company, Chubb Corp., announced
Monday.
   Federal also paid $11 million in ``goodwill'' payments to
farmers who applied for the insurance but did not receive coverage,
Chubb said.
   Chubb, the nation's 16th largest property and casualty insurer,
was criticized this summer for backing away from an insurance offer
that would pay off if there was not enough rain.
   Chubb said the 8,800 applications for $350 million in coverage
far exceeded the $43 million in coverage it could provide. About
7,000 farmers who did not get insurance were paid twice the amount
of their premium as compensation.
   ``This completes the loss payments on all the (1,176) policies
we issued,'' said Chubb spokeswoman Gail E. Devlin. ``It's
premature to talk about drought insurance'' for next year.
   Chubb estimated it would have paid an additional $55 million for
claims if it had provided coverage for all the farmers who wanted
it.
   Ms. Devlin said she knew of no change in the status of lawsuits
pending against the company in several states.
   The estimated state-by-state payments were:
   _Illinois, issued 265 policies worth $10 million, paid $5.9
million in losses, paid $1.3 million for 721 goodwill payments.
   _Indiana, issued 463 policies worth $16.3 million, paid $9.8
million in losses, paid $2.1 million for 1,543 goodwill payments.
   _Iowa, issued 135 policies worth $4.8 million, paid $1.2 million
in losses, paid $3.3 million for 1,922 goodwill payments.
   _Kentucky, issued no policies, paid $116,000 for 54 goodwill
payments.
   _Michigan, issued three policies worth $73,000, paid nothing for
losses, paid $2.2 million for 1,090 goodwill payments.
   _Minnesota, issued 228 policies worth $8.7 million, paid $2.7
million in losses, paid $1.4 million for 773 goodwill payments.
   _Missouri, issued no policies, paid $34,000 for 18 goodwill
payments.
   _Ohio, issued 68 policies worth $2.8 million, paid $100,000 in
losses, paid $700,000 for 663 goodwill payments.
   _Tennessee, issued no policies, paid $44,000 for 10 goodwill
payments.
   _Wisconsin, issued 14 policies worth $500,000, paid $133,000 in
losses, paid $200,000 for 183 goodwill payments.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Rally; Some See Bullish Trend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices rose sharply Monday on speculative
buying, leading gold and silver higher in what analysts said may
indicate a bullish turnaround in the precious metals market.
   On other futures markets, energy, cattle, grains, soybeans and
stock-index futures advanced while pork futures were mixed.
   Precious metals prices appear to be steadying and may be
charting an upward course after falling sharply last month,
analysts said.
   Platinum is expected to be in short supply for the next five
years and does not face technical resistance as stiff as that which
gold and silver must overcome to rally substantially, they said.
   But the gold and silver markets also have shown surprising
resilience in the past 10 days, defying some analysts' predictions
that gold was heading back below $400 a troy ounce.
   ``There's some bullish tone for the first time in quite a while.
It smells more bullish at these levels than it did before,'' said
Richard Levine, vice president of the precious metals and foreign
exchange group at Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   Platinum settled $9.70 to $11.20 higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, with the contract for delivery in October at
$538.40 a troy ounce.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $3 to $3.10
higher with the spot October contract at $412.20 a troy ounce and
December at $415.50; silver was 4 cents higher across the board
with December at $6.475 a troy ounce on the Comex.
   Monday's weaker dollar and higher energy markets helped boost to
the inflation-sensitive precious metals but there was more to the
buying, Levine said.
   ``It's not just because of crude or just because of the lower
dollar,'' he said. ``There's some momentum building here that I
just didn't see when gold was at $406 (last week).''
   The buying interest may be due to a readjustment of attitudes
about inflation, said Paul Cain, manager of precious metals for New
York-based Deak International, a large dealer of precious metals
and foreign currencies.
   Gold rallied late last year and early this year on fears of
double-digit inflation, he said. Those worries eased _ and gold
prices fell _ as monthly government reports showed inflation
holding steady at 4 percent to 5 percent.
   But now investors may be growing uncomfortable with even a 4
percent inflation rate and could be buying precious metals as an
inflation hedge, Cain said.
   Oil prices posted solid gains on the New York Merc on news that
oil ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council had thrown
their support behind a plan to increase OPEC's output quotas as a
way to stabilize prices.
   The proposed cap of 18.5 million to 19 million barrels a day
would be less than what OPEC is producing now but might lessen the
pressure to overproduce, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 22 cents to 29 cents
higher with November at $15.21 a barrel; heating oil was .06 cent
to .67 cent higher with November at 43.88 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was unchanged to 1.34 cents higher with November at 46.76
cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures made new life-of-contract highs in all delivery
months on expectations that Friday's quarterly cattle-on-feed
report from the Agriculture Department will show the first
quarterly decline since spring 1987 in the number of cattle being
fattened for slaughter, analysts said.
   Pork futures finished mixed on a combination of lower cash
markets and spillover strength from the cattle pits.
   Live cattle settled .18 cent to .60 cent higher with October at
73.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .75 cent higher
with October at 82.22 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .55
cent higher with October at 39.97 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .28 cent lower to .10 cent higher with February at
49.05 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade in reaction to wet weather in the Corn Belt, dry
conditions in the soybean fields of South America and new wheat
demand from China, analysts said.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 4 cents higher with December at
$4.30\ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1\ cents higher with December
at $2.95 a bushel; oats were { cent to 2} cents higher with
December at $2.55\ a bushel; soybeans were 5{ cents to 8 cents
higher with November at $8.10} a bushel.
   Stock-index futures rose strongly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled 1.35 points higher at 278.25.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Co. on Monday reported an increase of
8.9 percent in third-quarter profit from a year earlier, largely
due to an increase in volume.
   The soft drink maker and distributor said its net income in the
third quarter rose to $295.6 million, or 81 cents a share, from
$271.4 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue was up 5.7 percent, to $2.1 billion from
$2.0 billion.
   ``The momentum established in the first half of 1988 continued
in the third quarter, reflecting the success of our unit volume
building activities around the world,'' said Chief Executive
Officer Roberto C. Goizueta.
   The company said soft drink and syrup shipments in the third
quarter were up 5 percent in the United States and 7 percent
overseas, with Europe and the Pacific leading the international
markets.
   Soft drink unit volume grew 6 percent worldwide in both the
third quarter and the first nine months of the year, Coca-Cola said.
   For the January-September period, net income rose 11.9 percent _
to $809.2 million, or $2.20 a share, from $723.2 million, or $1.91
a share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue increased 11.4 percent, to $6.3 billion from
$5.7 billion.

   Unisys Corp. and NCR Corp. reported record third-quarter profits
on Monday, but both of the computer makers said they expected a
slowdown next year. They said demand was softest in the United
States.
   Meanwhile, Lotus Development Corp., the maker of personal
computer software, said its profit fell 25.1 percent and blamed the
decline on the cost of promotions for its 1-2-3 spreadsheet program.
   Unisys said it expected its results next year to be hurt by
``weak conditions'' in the U.S. computer market, the tight U.S.
defense budget and the renewed strength of the dollar, which makes
American-made goods more expensive in foreign markets.
   Unisys said it was aiming for single-digit revenue increases but
double-digit earnings gains in 1989.
   NCR also said it expected single-digit percentage gains in
revenue next year, but made no profit forecast. The company said
its orders had fallen in the latest quarter from the record levels
of a year earlier.
   Unisys, which has headquarters in Blue Bell, Pa., and Detroit,
said its profit rose 16.4 percent to a record $151 million, or 72
cents per share on a fully diluted basis, from $129.7 million, or
65 cents per fully diluted share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2
percent to $2.27 billion from $2.22 billion.
   Fully diluted refers to the number of shares that would be
outstanding if all convertible preferred stock were converted into
common shares.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Unisys said its
earnings rose 28.1 percent to $462.6 million, or $2.22 per fully
diluted share, from $361.1 million, or $1.84 a fully diluted share,
a year earlier. Revenue rose 1.6 percent to $7.03 billion from
$6.91 billion.
   NCR, based in Dayton, Ohio, said its revenue and earnings were a
record for a third quarter. Earnings rose to $103.1 million, or
$1.26 a share, from $97.8 million, or $1.05 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose to $1.41 billion from $1.34 billion.
   For the nine months, profit rose 12.3 percent to $289.7 million,
or $3.49 a share, from $257.9 million, or $2.74 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue to $4.19 billion from $3.82 billion.
   Lotus, of Cambridge, Mass., said it took a charge against its
earnings to reflect the costs it will incur when it gives free
upgrades to its upcoming version of Lotus 1-2-3 to the people who
purchased existing versions under a special promotion.
   Lotus, which repeatedly has postponed introduction of the new
software, said it earned $14.3 million in the quarter ended Oct. 1,
or 31 cents a share, down from $19.1 million, or 42 cents a share,
a year earlier. Sales rose to $116.8 million, from $101.2 million.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Lotus said its
profit rose to $49.9 million, or $1.08 a share, from $49.1 million,
also $1.08 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $356.2 million,
from $280 million.

<HEAD>Sale Of Pump, Cable Operations Boost TRW Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   TRW Inc.'s third-quarter earnings increased 7.9
percent to $68 million because of the sale of the company's TRW
Reda Pump and TRW Oilwell Cable operations, the company said Monday.
   TRW's earnings for the third quarter last year were $63 million.
Net earnings per share rose to $1.11, from $1.01 last year.
   Sales totaled $1.65 billion, off 3 percent from $1.70 billion a
year ago.
   The company said its $63 million after-tax gain from the sale of
TRW Reda Pump and TRW Oilwell Cable were partially offset by an
after-tax charge of $43 million to cover the cost of a program to
resolve claims from dealers and truck owners arising from the
recall of integral steering gears for heavy-duty trucks.
   ``Our space and defense business was down somewhat, as expected
given the current market uncertainty and last year's very strong
third quarter,'' said Ruben F. Mettler, chairman and chief
executive officer. ``Without the recall costs, our automotive
business would have posted another good quarter and what has been a
very good year for the segment.''
   Sales in the space and defense segment dropped 5 percent from
$827 million to $786 million. In the automotive segment, TRW said
its third-quarter sales rose 11 percent from $513 million to $679
million. Sales in the information systems segment rose 6 percent
from $128 million to $135 million, the company said.
   For the nine months, the company reported net earnings of $205
million, up from $177 million, and net sales of $5.27 billion, from
$5.08 billion.

   Mid-Continent Resources Inc. laid off 140
miners Monday and blamed federal mine inspectors for oppressive
enforcement.
   The coal company claims that excessive inspections by the U.S.
Mine Safety & Health Administration, including 273 safety orders
and 1,381 safety citations in the past year, prevents Mid-Continent
from filling a South Korean coal contract.
   The layoffs came four days after a federal judge declined to
issue an injunction requested by Mid-Continent to halt what the
company views as overzealous inspections by MSHA.
   However, the top federal inspector for western coal mines said
he put round-the-clock inspectors at the Coal Basin mines because
Mid-Continent continually failed to meet safety standards.
   In 1981, 15 miners died in a methane explosion at a
Mid-Continent mine. The company's property is in the Crystal River
Valley of western Colorado, about 40 miles from Aspen.
   John DeMichiei, western manager for MSHA, said Mid-Continent
miners shouldn't be exposed to the hazards he's found in the deep,
gassy mines.
   ``We're not fabricating problems,'' he said. ``A failure to
comply will inevitably result in another incident.''
   Diane Delaney, spokeswoman for Mid-Continent, said the layoff of
29 percent of the company's work force was ``too bad, because it's
not necessary. But until we get this worked out with MSHA, we can't
work.''
   The company is backing out of its hard-won, 10-year coal
contract with Pohang Iron and Steel Co., Delaney said, citing a
loss of $30 million in trade each year.
   Delaney said the South Korean company bought 80 percent of the
mine's coal in 1987 and kept Mid-Continent afloat during the
13-month steelworkers' strike at Geneva Steel in Orem, Utah,
Mid-Continent's other major customer.
   A company news release described ``an increasingly adversarial
and counterproductive relationship'' between Mid-Continent and MSHA.
   The judge who heard company arguments about MSHA advised
mediation last Thursday and estimated a ruling might be made in
three or four months.

<HEAD>Arthur Andersen Consultants Get Own Identity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arthur Andersen & Co., the largest accounting
firm in the nation, announced a new name for its lucrative
consulting division Monday in a move thought to be prompted by
concerns over ethics and personnel.
   The change in the division's name _ from U.S. Management
Information Consulting to Andersen Consulting _ ``creates a clear,
separate identity,'' said Duane R. Kullberg, managing partner and
chief executive officer of the Chicago-based company.
   Andersen's consulting service helps businesses tailor computer
systems to their specific needs.
   Andersen launched a study last month to consider a possible
restructuring of the entire company, which some observers believe
may be a prelude to splitting off consulting as an independent
business.
   The growth of consulting services at major accounting firms has
raised questions about the ethics of supposedly objective
accounting companies advising their clients on managerial decisions.
   Some experts have said the ethical problems can only be solved
by splitting off consulting as a separate business.
   Consultants at accounting firms complain that although they are
responsible for much of their firms' revenue growth, they are
treated and paid as second-class citizens by managing partners who
came up through the tax and audit business.
   The rift has cost Andersen some of its top consulting partners,
including four who quit on Friday to join a new consulting venture.
   The consulting arm of Arthur Andersen accounts for about 40
percent of the company's total revenue and is growing at a rate of
about 30 percent a year, officials said.
   Consulting fees are expected to total more than $1.3 billion at
privately held Andersen this year, compared with $1.7 billion in
revenue from the company's tax and audit portion.

<HEAD>Two Computer Officials Settle with SEC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former officials of a computer software
company accused of misusing $1.1 million from a stock offering to
buy securities and a condominium for themselves settled charges
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.
   Frederick S. Plotkin of New York, former chairman of Intex
Software Systems International Ltd., and his brother, Arthur J.
Plotkin of Guttenberg, N.J., a vice president and director of
Intex, were charged in an SEC civil complaint with making false
statements in disclosure documents between May 1986 and February
1987.
   The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in New York, says
the documents failed to disclose that the Plotkins used $1.1
million from a stock offering to purchase securities for Frederick
Plotkin and repay loans that he incurred and to purchase a
condominium apartment in Guttenberg, N.J., for use by Arthur
Plotkin.
   Without admitting or denying the charges, the brothers agreed to
a court order forbidding them from further securities law
violations. They were dismissed by Intex' board of directors in
March 1987.
   Awni K. Abboushi, the current president of Intex, which is based
in New York, said it was ``heartbreaking'' that the SEC was not
extracting a financial penalty from the Plotkins. He said Intex has
sued the brothers for damages and compensation but said the company
lacks the money to pursue the suit.
   Harry J. Weiss, SEC assistant director of enforcement, said the
Plotkins were not charged with using corporate funds for their
personal benefit, but rather with failing to disclose the misuse.
He said there were no penalties possible under the charges in the
complaint.
   Arthur H. Christy, an attorney for the Plotkins, said his
clients had no comment.
   Intex sells computer word-processing packages that permit the
operator to enter text in one or more languages.

   General Electric Co. announced Monday that
it has landed a $150 million order from All Nippon Airways of Japan
to provide GE engines for six Boeing 747-400 jet planes.
   Officials at GE's jet engine plant in this Cincinnati suburb
said the order was for the company's CF6-80C2 engine. They said the
CF6-80C2 remains the best-selling engine worldwide for the 747-700
widebody jets.
   Three jets will be delivered to All Nippon in both 1990 and 1991.
   GE officials said the order solidifies the company's position in
the Japanese market. In October 1987, GE announced that it had
nosed out a major competitor, the Pratt & Whitney division of
United Technologies Corp., and obtained an order to provide engines
to Japan Air Lines for five new Boeing 747-400 jets.
   Japan Air Lines has been the largest operator of the four-engine
747s. Until the October 1987 deal with GE, all its 747s had used
Pratt & Whitney engines.

<HEAD>British Airways Weighs Purchase Of Boeing Aircraft</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: adds Boeing comment in new 8th graf.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways may purchase a number of Boeing
737 aircraft to replace its aging fleet of short
takeoff-and-landing passenger planes, a spokesman for the airline
said Monday.
   The small, two-engine 737 is among several aircraft British
Airways is sizing up as a successor to the BAC 1-11s due to be
removed soon from London's main airports, Heathrow and Gatwick,
said the spokesman on condition of anonymity.
   The 99-seat BAC 1-11s, manufactured by British Aircraft
Corporation Ltd., will be transferred to provincial airports, said
the spokesman.
   A decision from top British Airways management on which
replacement aircraft to purchase is expected soon, the spokesman
said. Other aircraft under consideration are the British Aerospace
BAe-146, the Fokker 100 and the Airbus A320.
   ``Historically, we've tended to be a Boeing airline,'' said the
spokesman. ``Their aircraft fit the profile we want.''
   The spokesman denied a report in London's Times newspaper that
British Airways directors had already decided to purchase 35
aircraft from the Seattle, Wash., aircraft manufacturer.
   The newspaper said British Airways would purchase 25 of the 737s
worth more than $750 million and about 10 longer-distance 767
medium-sized jets. The 737 aircraft would be from the 300, 400 and
500 series, providing between 110 and 160 seats, the story said.
   In Seattle, Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman David Jimenez
declined comment on the report. Boeing's policy is not to discuss
aircraft sales or negotiations until a customer announces them.
   In May, Boeing and Airbus Industrie of Europe split the biggest
commercial aircraft order in history, a 130-plane purchase by
International Lease Finance Corp. of Beverly Hills, California.
   Boeing got the largest part of that contract, selling 100 planes
for $3.69 billion. Among the aircraft were 72 of the 737 series.

<TEXT>
   A major stockholder in Allegheny International
Inc. has sued the company's board of directors, claiming they hid
the firm's deterioriating financial position from investors and
sold off subsidiaries at below market value.
   Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, a New York brokerage and investment firm
which owns 25 percent of preferred stock and 7 percent of common
stock, filed suit in U.S. District Court on Friday, naming 11
current and former directors as defendants.
   The New York firm said it and others ``had invested millions of
dollars in Allegheny in reliance on defendants' material
misrepresentations, omissions and acts of fradulent concealment.''
   It charged Allegheny International began selling
income-producing assets in 1986 to pay its debts because of failed
investments in real estate and in oil and gas. It charged the
company then overstated the value of its remaining operations.
   Although the Pittsburgh-based conglomerate realized more than
$500 million from the sales, the money representated ``far less
than ... their real market value,'' according to the lawsuit.
   The lawsuit also charged that a March 1987 tender offer by a
subsidiary of the investment banking firm First Boston Inc. of New
York relied on inflated projections of Allegheny International's
performance.
   Spear, Leeds & Kellogg purchased additional shares of Allegheny
International stock based on the projections, according to the
lawsuit.
   The lawsuit charged that the true financial state of the company
was reflected in Allegheny International's announcement that it has
lost $285.4 million for the fiscal year ending Sept. 27, 1987.
   Allegheny International spokesman Edward Romanoff declined
comment on the lawsuit.
   Allegheny International sought protection under Chapter 11 of
federal bankruptcy laws in February. The company manufactures
Sunbeam and Oster products, among others.

   United Auto Workers and Caterpillar Inc.
negotiators met Monday for extended contract talks amid speculation
that the two sides had agreed at least in principle on an
acceptable job-security package, considered a major roadblock.
   ``It's my understanding they're just working out the language on
the details,'' one UAW source, who declined to give his name, said
of the reports that accord was near on 85 percent job security.
   ``Progress has been made,'' Local 974 bargaining chairman Jerry
Brown said. ``We're moving. That's good.''
   Bill Casstevens, international UAW secretary-treasurer, said
negotiators were to meet again Monday night with hope of ironing
out more contract details.
   ``I'd like to get out of here tonight, not physically but at
least with an agreement,'' Casstevens said. `We're going to work at
it (and) try to do it, but I don't know if it will happen. I got
out of the prediction business a long time ago.''
   Casstevens declined to confirm the 85 percent job-security
provision in the new contract, instead noting that several issues
remained on the table.
   ``We're not going to pick and choose. We're going to work on all
of them,'' he said. ``Just when you think the minefield is clear
you end up stepping on one if you're not careful.''
   Also still to be resolved is whether provisions concerning
special job classifications will be decided at the local or the
national level. The union has said that Caterpillar wanted to
create new special job classifications that would restrict workers
from transferring to other jobs within the company.

<TEXT>
   Mexico will receive a short-term loan of up to
$3.5 billion from the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve to
support new economic reforms the country is instituting, officials
said Monday.
   ``The U.S. financial authorities believe that these measures (in
Mexico) build upon the progress already achieved in the sustained
adjustment effort undergone by the Mexican economy,'' the Treasury
and central bank said in a statement.
   The loan from the Fed and Treasury is intended as a ``bridge''
until Mexico can develop a longer-term loan program with the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
   The Mexican government on Saturday announced a series of
measures designed to cope with the unanticipated decline in world
oil prices.
   They included more privatization of state-owned businesses, a
plan to hold down the Mexican budget deficit and the extension,
through the end of the year, of the so-called Economic Solidarity
Pact.
   The pact, among the business, labor and government sectors,
includes a series of inflation-fighting moves including a freeze on
peso currency exchange rates and on the minimum wage and on prices
for government-regulated goods and services.
   The U.S. statement praised ``Mexico's adjustment record'' in
reducing its budget deficit and improving its trade balance, which
it said ``has established the basic conditions for the renewal of
sustained economic growth.''
   ``U.S. and Mexican authorities have agreed that Mexico's
strengthened economic policies merit support,'' the statement said.

<TEXT>
   Two researchers from the United States
and one from Britain won the Nobel Prize in medicine Monday for
helping develop drugs to fight AIDS, herpes, leukemia, malaria,
heart disease and stomach ulcers.
   The award capped more than four decades of pioneering work for
Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings, who began collaborating
in 1945. They work at Wellcome Research Laboratories in Research
Triangle Park, N.C.
   They share the $390,000 prize with Sir James W. Black of King's
College Hospital Medical School in London. His research led to a
beta blocker drug for heart disease and a drug for peptic ulcers.
   ``I wished I had my beta blockers handy,'' Black, 64, quipped at
a news conference at King's College after he learned he won.
   Dr. Gosta Garton, a member of the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska
Institute, which awards the prize, said the three winners were
``well-chosen.''
   ``You can see the direct working effects'' of their research,
said Garton. ``The entire research world knows that they have been
in the picture for years.''
   The Nobel Assembly credited Elion, 70, and Hitchings, 83, with
helping develop six different drugs that can be used for at least
nine serious conditions.
   They included 6-mercaptopurine and thioguanine for leukemia;
azathioprine for organ transplant rejection and autoimmune
diseases; allopurinol for gout; acyclovir for herpes virus
infections, pyrimethamine for malaria; and trimethoprim for
bacterial infections and pulmonary infections brought on by AIDS.
   The assembly said their ideas also paved the way for development
of azidothymidine, or AZT, which is the best documented drug so far
in the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   AIDS, usually transmitted through sexual contact, infected
needles or blood transfusions, renders the immune system unable to
resist disease. AZT is the only federally approved drug for
treating AIDS in the United States.
   ``I'm pleased more for my descendants than I am for myself,''
Hitchings said from his office at Wellcome. ``I've had a lot of
honors, but the most important honors for me have been meeting
patients whose lives have been saved or whose children's lives have
been saved by drugs I've invented.''
   Elion said from her home in Chapel Hill, N.C, that she couldn't
believe she won and didn't even know she was nominated.
   Asked about her greatest achievement, she said: ``You can't
discriminate among your `children.' Each one in its own time was
the most exciting.''
   Elion and Hitchings broke new ground in finding the difference
in the processing of genetic material between normal cells and
cancer cells, protozoa, bacteria and viruses, the Nobel Assembly
said.
   Knowing those differences allowed researchers to attack
disease-causing organisms by interfering with their replication
without harming healthy ones, the assembly said.
   Black helped develop propranolol, a beta blocker used to treat
heart disease and high blood pressure.
   Beta blockers block the stimulating effect of adrenaline on the
heart, reducing the rate and the force at which the heart pumps
blood through the body _ and reducing high blood pressure.
   ``Previously used drugs acted by increasing the oxygen transport
to the heart. In contrast, Black's idea was to decrease the oxygen
demand of the heart,'' the announcement said. Specialists said
Black also contributed to treatments for stroke and high blood
pressure.
   Physiologist Bengt Pernow, another member of the Nobel Assembly,
said Black made ``the greatest breakthrough when it comes to
pharmaceuticals against heart illness since the disovery of
digitalis 200 years ago.''
   In 1972, Black developed another medication, cimetidine, which
introduced a new principle in the treatment of peptic ulcer.
   ``Black in the laboratory has relieved more human suffering than
thousands of doctors in a lifetime at the bedside,'' said Desmond
Laurence, head of pharmacology at University College in London.
   Black said scientists are under too much pressure to produce
immediate practical results. ``I think there needs to be much more
money for scientists to do experiments they are almost ashamed of
because they're so untested,'' he said.
   Black was born in Scotland and earned degrees in surgery and
medicine at the University of St. Andrews.
   Elion has worked at Wellcome Research Laboratories since 1944
and as a senior research chemist since 1950. Since 1983, she has
been a scientist emeritus at the laboratory, which is the research
arm of the Burroughs Wellcome Co. pharmaceutical firm.
   Elion has been a research professor of pharmacology at Duke
University since 1983. She earned her bachelor's degree from Hunter
College in 1937 and a master's degree from New York University in
1941.
   Hitchings received a bachelor's degree from the University of
Washington in 1927 and a doctorate from Harvard University in 1933.
   After teaching at Harvard and Western Reserve University, he
joined Burroughs Wellcome in 1942. He became its research director
in 1955 and was a director of the company from 1968 to 1984.
   No U.S. researcher won the medicine prize until 1933. But the
United States has dominated in the past 20 years, with Elion and
Hitchings becoming the 31st and 32nd Americans to win. During that
time, there have been 20 laureates from other countries.
   Last year's medicine winner was Susumu Tonegawa of Japan for his
study of the body's immune system at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   The Nobels were first awarded in 1901 as a stipulation in the
will of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist who made a fortune
on his invention of dynamite.
   U.N. peacekeeping forces won the Nobel Peace Prize, announced
Sept. 29 in Oslo, Norway. Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz last
week becamethe first Arabic-language literature laureate.
   The economics prize is to be announced Tuesday and chemistry and
physics on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Bath Iron Works will pay only a fraction of a
record $4.2 million fine for alleged health and safety violations
under the terms of a settlement announced Monday with the U.S.
Labor Department.
   Under the settlement, Bath Iron Works agreed to pay $650,000 in
fines by January, to correct any outstanding violations by April
and to drop any legal challenges to the actions by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration.
   ``This settlement reflects BIW's acknowledgment that some
violations did exist and its commitment to implement action where
further improvements were needed,'' company Chairman William E.
Haggett told reporters at the shipyard.
   ``The company also believes the dramatic fine reduction and
elimination of (violations categorized as willful) is a significant
vindication of BIW's employees and the shipyard's past operational
practices.''
   An OSHA spokesman at the agency's regional headquarters in
Boston said it agreed to the 85 percent reduction in the fine
because of the company's willingness to accept the terms of the
settlement.
   ``OSHA is not terribly interested in the money,'' John Chavez
said. ``OSHA is interested in the health and safety of the
workers.''
   The shipbuilders union, which had initially vowed to oppose any
reduction, applauded the settlement Monday.
   The company and union ``now must concentrate our efforts on
compliance and safety rather than needless litigation,'' said John
``Stoney'' Dionne, a spokesman for Local 6 of the Industrial Union
of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America.
   Bath Iron Works, a major contractor for the Navy's Aegis cruiser
and destroyer programs, is the state's largest private employer
with more than 10,000 workers.
   Last November, OSHA proposed the original $4.2 million fine
against Bath Iron Works for underreporting employee injuries and
illnesses which allegedly occurred between January 1985 and May
1987. OSHA also cited the presence of asbestos-laden dust at the
shipyard and inadequate testing of toxic concentrations of the dust.
   The company denied trying to hide or misrepresent worker-injury
records and appealed the fine, which was the largest penalty OSHA
has ever levied against a single company.
