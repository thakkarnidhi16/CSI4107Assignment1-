<HEAD>Fight Wimpdom, Abolish Vice Presidency, Professor Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The vice presidency converts respectable
politicians into champagne-sipping wimps and ought to be abolished,
a political scientist says.
   William Gormley said Richard M. Nixon, Hubert H. Humphrey and
Walter Mondale were examples of vigorous congressmen who became
victims of a job that has little authority.
   Gormley, an associate director of the University of Wisconsin's
Robert M. La Follette Institute of Public Affairs, also said the
office is outmoded because the founding fathers conceived of the
vice presidency as an advisory post. Yet presidents today have
plenty of advisers, he said.
   Worst of all, Gormley said, is the effect the vice presidency
has on the people who hold the office.
   ``The vice presidency turns a vigorous, robust individual into a
wimp,'' he said. ``After a few years as vice president, even a
previously vigorous and creative political leader turns into a
wishy-washy, mealy-mouthed sycophant.''
   ``Vice presidents have always been wimps. Nixon, Humphrey and
Mondale were all wimpy vice presidents,'' he said.
   ``In order to do the job as vice president, they must play the
role of a meek and humble servant, a presidential loyalist, a
defender of the president's position,'' he said.
   The country could easily turn to the secretary of state or the
speaker of the House of Representatives for a successor if a
president were to die in office, he said.
   The secretary of state also could perform many of the vice
president's functions, he said.
   ``The secretary of state can sip champagne at diplomatic parties
and look somber and dignified at state funerals,'' Gormley said.
``The vice president is eminently dispensable.''

<HEAD>Police Arrest Lebanese Gunman After Standoff At Libyan Embassy</HEAD>

   Police ended a nearly 12-hour standoff
with an armed Lebanese man barricaded in the Libyan Embassy by
rushing in and grabbing the gunman after he had fallen asleep,
officials said.
   No shots were fired in the incident Thursday, and a handful of
Libyan embassy employees who had been trapped on the top floors
were not injured, police said.
   Police identified the man as El-Ibrahim Edelbi, 22, and said he
had escaped from a prison in Goettingen on July 8 along with a
Turkish accomplice who has since been recaptured.
   Edelbi was serving a three-year prison term for assault, police
said.
   For nearly 12 hours police negotiated with Edelbi, who pulled
out a pistol inside the embassy's first-floor reception room after
he was denied a visa for Libya. Embassy employees were able to flee
the building quickly or run to the upper floors, leaving Edelbi by
himself, police said.
   ``He had become very weak since his escape and looked exhausted
during the negotiations,'' said Ulrich Fischer, head of the Bonn
police team that captured Edelbi.
   Fischer's team was able to watch Edelbi by making use of a video
camera that is a normal part of embassy security.
   At about 9:15 p.m., police noticed Edelbi had fallen asleep and
they rushed him, Fischer said.
   ``Finally, he just fell asleep from exhaustion,'' said Fischer.
``He did not offer us any resistance.''
   Police said they did not know where Edelbi got the pistol.
   Edelbi was taken to a local hospital for examination, officials
said.
   A team of police officers negotiated with the gunman for almost
12 hours by telephone as well as through a metal-barred door at the
entrance to the structure.
   ``He demanded that he not be returned to prison. He said he
wanted to go to Libya because the Libyans always help the
Lebanese,'' said Fischer.
   Police spokesman Hans Georg Classen said Edelbi was born in
Beirut. But he said Bonn police did not know how long Edelbi had
lived in West Germany, whether he had any relatives in this country
or know any other details about the man other than his prison
record.
   Edelbi had been at the prison in Goettingen for about 18 months,
Classen said.
   Shortly after the standoff began, heavily armed police officers
wearing combat gear climbed through a second-story window into the
embassy, known as the Libyan People's Bureau.
   Those officers guarded access to the upper floors of the
five-story building in case Edelbi tried to take hostages from
among the employees on the higher floors, Fischer said.
   Omar K. Bukhries, head of the embassy, had given police
permission to enter the building, Classen said. Bukhries was able
to escape through a side door shortly after the standoff began.
   Police sealed off the area after embassy employees signaled an
alarm shortly before 10 a.m.

<TEXT>
   As Mikhail S. Gorbachev made his way
around Poland this week, he fell further and further behind
schedule, leaving thousands of people who had been invited to see
him waiting for hours _ sometimes in vain.
   The Soviet leader arrived in the western port city of Sczcecin
on Wednesday already an hour behind schedule, and by the time he
reached his first scheduled event, a speech at a shipyard, he was
two hours late.
   Polish authorities, anxious to ensure all went smoothly for
their Soviet visitor, had seated the workers nearly two hours ahead
of time. So when Gorbachev finally arrived, the 3,000 people in the
audience were squirming after sitting practically silent on
backless wooden benches for four hours.
   Organizers of the trip kept adding events to Gorbachev's
schedule, including a visit to a private farm on his way to the
airport to return to Warsaw.
   It was nearly midnight when the Communist Party chief arrived
back in the capital, just about four hours late. The delay forced
cancellation of a special chamber music concert that had been
arranged for Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, in a palace on the
outskirts of the capital.
   Although most of the unannounced stops had been arranged in
advance, with state-run television often set up to record the
events, Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban attributed the
delays to what he called Gorbachev's extraordinary popularity among
the Polish people.
   Never before, he said, had a visitor drawn such crowds or
generated so much ``spontaneous joy.''
   But at all those events reporters were permitted to witness, the
crowds were screened in advance, and Polish security often checked
peoples' invitations against their identification cards before
permitting them within sight of the Soviet leader.

<HEAD>Few Controls On Ingredients, FDA Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans have indicated they would like to
see more federal regulation of the $17 billion-a-year cosmetic
industry, which currently lacks stringent controls, an official of
the Food and Drug Administration says.
   Heinz J. Eiermann, director of the FDA's division of cosmetic
technology, said people are often surprised to learn that
cosmetics, which usually contain chemicals, have so few federal
guidelines.
   Eiermann made his comments in a telephone interview Thursday
after a House subcommittee heard testimony about the potential
danger of some of the chemicals in cosmetics.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairman of the small business panel,
said some of the chemicals in cosmetics can cause cancer, birth
defects, central nervous disorders, skin and eye irritations and
allergic reactions.
   Wyden promised to have additional hearings in the fall to weigh
whether Congress should take action to enforce additional testing
and labeling of cosmetics. About 8,000 chemicals are used in
cosmetics and perfume.
   He said the FDA does not have the authority to test cosmetics
for safety before they are sold, and cannot require manufacturers
to provide test data on a product's safety.
   The only actions FDA can take are to seize contaminated products
and to ask manufacturers to change their advertising claims, he
said.
   Retail products sold to consumers must be labeled as to
contents, but that regulation does not apply to products sold to
business establishments, such as hair styling salons.
   Eiermann said it is Congress' responsibility to decide whether
Americans want cosmetics to be subject to the same standards
applied to food and drugs.
   But he said the FDA did a food survey in the 1970s and included
questions about cosmetics. ``There is a preponderance of the
population ... they think the products should be regulated,'' he
said.
   Results of the study were never published because they were part
of the broader survey, he said.
   The Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, a group that
represents the industry, said cosmetic companies are committed to
safety. ``Because of this commitment, personal care products are
among the safest of any consumer products and are used confidently
by millions of persons on a daily basis,''it said in a statement.
   The industry has a program of self-regulation that involves
testing ingredients, the statement said.
   Beth Shulman, vice president of the United Food and Commercial
Workers International Union, said Congress should pass legislation
requiring that all cosmetic products contain ingredient labels.
   Secondly, she said, more studies need to be done to determine
the long-term effects on people who use the chemicals.
   Dr. James Cone, chief of the occupational health clinic at San
Francisco General Hospital, urged Congress to take steps to warn
consumers and beauticians about any possible health hazards in
cosmetics.
   He suggested that products contain detailed labels that clearly
spell out the nature of any chemicals in the cosmetics and explain
possible health hazards.
   Moreover, the government should collect better information about
the chemicals and their effects and remove any that are deemed
dangerous, Cone said.

<TEXT>
   At least 1,000 NAACP members, some carrying a
casket to symbolize the burial of apartheid, prayed and
demonstrated before the South African Embassy to protest that
nation's system of racial discrimination.
   Raising their fists and chanting ``let our people go,'' the
demonstrators lifted the grey casket before the embassy entrance,
as NAACP executive director Benjamin L. Hooks led the crowd
Thursday in a series of prayers that ``hearts might be changed.''
   Hooks prayed that ``those white folk in South Africa, that call
themselves Christians, may start acting like Christians and
recognize that they are their brother's keeper ... that we are all
one blood.''
   ``We come here today in the spirit of Walter White, Roy Wilkins,
Martin Luther King ... to say that we won't be satisfied until the
walls of segregation, apartheid and oppression are brought low in
South Africa,'' said the Rev. Jerry Guess, NAACP communications
director.
   ``We come today praying that our own pharaoh, who sits at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue, will hear these voices (and realize that) we
cannot exist in this world, half slave and half free,'' Guess
prayed, referring to the White House address.
   Hooks then pointed to the casket and pronounced sentence on the
policies of apartheid, segregation, hatred, racial discrmination,
unjust treatment and inequality.
   He led the crowd in the closing words over the coffin, saying,
``dust to dust, ashes to ashes _ apartheid you'll never rise
again!'' The coffin was placed in a white hearse as the
demonstrators sang ``Oh, Freedom,'' a song from the civil rights
movement.
   The half-hour march was the culmination of South Africa Day at
the 79th annual convention of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People. There were no arrests.
   In the morning sessions, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and
Randall Robinson, head of TransAfrica, a lobby group for the
Caribbean and Africa, urged the delegates to support legislation to
impose stronger economic sanctions on the African nation.

<TEXT>
   The nation's largest private television
stations began limiting coverage of guerrilla violence in a bid to
encourage peace, and the government prolonged a state of emergency
to combat the rebels.
   Also Thursday, Maoist rebels from the group known as Shining
Path shot to death the city administrator of Chincha, 120 miles
south of Lima, police said.
   Television coverage of Peru's eight-year rebel insurgency had
become a battle ground among stations in ratings wars, with some
channels dedicating up to 15 minutes a night to violent footage.
   ``The accord of a minute'' was agreed to by Lima channels 2, 4,
5 and 9 _ most of the city's stations. It calls for the time
alloted to local news reports of violence held to 60 seconds per
broadcast.
   Channel 5 press director Carlos Paz said the goal of the
self-imposed pact was to contribute to national pacification.
   President Alan Garcia prolonged a state of emergency for two
months in the coastal capital of Lima and parts of six other states
in the Andes Mountains and Amazon jungle. The announcement was made
in a decree in the official gazette El Peruano.
   Police said three Shining Path guerrilla gunmen killed
administrator Mario Casas, a member of Garcia's center-left Aprista
Party, near his Chincha home and escaped before authorities
arrived. The official was leaving home for work.
   The assassination was carried out like dozens of others by the
rebel band against government and party officials.
   But most of the more than 10,000 people slain during the
insurgency have been highland peasants caught in the fighting
between guerrillas and government forces.
   The state of emergency was first imposed in highland Ayacucho
two years after the Shining Path, inspired by the late Chinese
leader Mao Zedong, launched its insurgency there in 1980 to topple
Peru's elected government and install Marxist rule.
   A state of emergency suspends citizens' rights to meet publicly
and travel freely, while permitting government forces to conduct
searches without warrants and hold suspects for long periods before
filing charges.

<HEAD>Tax Bill Gives Breaks to Mail Carriers, Pistachio Growers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pistachio growers, mail carriers and freelance
writers are in for tax breaks under a bill approved by the House
Ways and Means Committee. Some farmers, moonlighters and pipe
smokers will help pick up the tab.
   After a month of off-and-on work behind closed doors, the
committee on Thursday voted 33-3 for a package providing $7.1
billion in specialized tax relief over the next three years.
Because of budget restrictions the bill also carries the tax
increases to pay for the cuts.
   The bill originally was designed solely to correct hundreds of
errors that showed up in the landmark tax overhaul enacted in 1986.
But since this is the only tax bill with a chance of passing
Congress this year, committee members ended up adding numerous
amendments extending some expiring tax benefits and dozens of
others providing relief to specialized groups of taxpayers.
   For example, the bill would allow an 80 percent tax deduction
for contributions to college athletic scholarship funds when such
``gifts'' guarantee a fan the privilege of buying a game ticket.
   Because the bill would raise other taxes on some people, there
is enough controversy associated with it to make enactment far less
than certain. For one thing, the Reagan administration opposes some
of the increases.
   Too, there is some doubt that Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, will interrupt his vice
presidential campaign to handle a bill that raises taxes on anybody.
   Some of the dozens of provisions in the bill would:
   _Allow rural mail carriers to deduct 33.75 cents for each mile a
personal car is driven on a mail route; most people are allowed
just 22.5 cents a mile for business-related mileage.
   _Give certain producers of pistachio nuts a break on how they
account for production costs.
   _Exempt freelance writers, artists and photographers from a new
requirement that they deduct expenses of an endeavor only after it
starts producing income.
   _Impose a tax of $2.67 per pound of pipe tobacco; that is
equivalent to the existing 16-cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes.
   _Tighten depreciation provisions for single-purpose farm
structures, such as poultry houses, and farm machinery.
   _Prohibit any person with a home-based business (including
moonlighters) from deducting any part of the base monthly telephone
charge as a business expense.
   _Renew at a reduced level the tax exclusion for
employer-provided educational assistance. Only $1,500 of such aid
per year could avoid tax, down from $5,250.
   _Extend several expiring provisions, including credits for
research and experimentation and for owners of low-income rental
housing and a tax exemption for bonds used to help lower-income
families buy their first home.
   _Relieve farmers from a 1987 requirement that they pay tax on
off-road diesel fuel and then apply for a refund.
   _Allow owners of mutual fund shares to deduct certain fund
expenses without regard to the usual 2 percent floor under
miscellaneous deductions.
   _Remove some tax benefits from single-premium life insurance
policies.
   _Raise taxes on various corporations, including those that own
parts of other corporations and defense contractors.
   _Assure that fellowships created to honor the memory of
Challenger astronaut Christa McAuliffe are tax-free so long as the
recipient teacher uses the money for academic improvement.
   _Permit operators of offshore or Alaska oil rigs and of some
commercial vessels (but not luxury liners) to deduct the full cost
of meals provided to employees; most business may deduct only 80
percent.
   _Allow a surviving spouse to defer taxation on certain profits
from the sale of a principal home, just as though the spouse had
not died. Present law denies such a break if a spouse dies after a
home is sold and before a new one is built.

   The nation's top court dropped
illegal arrest and extortion charges against the most prominent
civilian in a former military government.
   But the Federal Court on Thursday also upheld the same charges
against former President Gen. Jorge Videla and former Interior
Minister Gen. Albano Harguindeguy.
   Thursday's decision freed former Economy Minister Jose Martinez
de Hoz. The court gave no reason for its action.
   All three had been charged in the case of two Argentine
businessmen who said they were victimized by the government leaders
in 1976.
   The former economy minister, jailed with Harguindeguy in this
capital since April 27, drove off from prison Thursday without
comment.
   Videla already is serving a life sentence in connection with his
conviction for human rights violations during the military's
1976-83 rule over Argentina.

   Senate Republicans say they'll ``make no
effort'' to wage a floor fight for Bernard Siegan, a conservative
appellate court nominee whose writings were cited as too extreme to
win Democratic backing.
   In a vote that had similarities to the rejection last year of
Supreme Court nominee Robert H. Bork, the Democratic-led Judiciary
Committee voted 8-6 along party lines Thursday to recommend Senate
rejection of Siegan.
   The professor of constitutional law at the University of San
Diego was President Reagan's nominee for the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, covering nine Western states.
   Like Bork, Siegan wrote often on the law, and _ like Bork _ his
views often were contrary to precedents set by the Supreme Court,
especially on civil rights and civil liberties.
   But while senators decided a Supreme Court nominee deserved a
full Senate vote, even Siegan's supporters said no such effort
would be made for him.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., whose motion to report the
nomination without recommendation failed on a 7-7 tie, said
afterwards that Republicans ``will make no effort to take it to the
floor. It's obvious that it's over.''
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah and another Siegan supporter, agreed
that there would be no floor fight.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz. first voted for rejection, but
then sided with the Republican no-recommendation motion.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who offered the motion to
reject Siegan, criticized the nominee's almost total lack of
experience before federal courts _ he had one case three decades
ago _ and said the nominee practiced ``judicial activism in the
extreme.''
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., agreed that Siegan's writings were
``extreme'' but voted for him anyway, arguing a law professor
should have freedom to write what he chooses.
   Specter, who opposed Bork, said he would be more concerned about
Siegan's views if he were a Supreme Court nominee. An appellate
court candidate would have no choice but to follow Supreme Court
rulings, he said _ a point Siegan made in two confirmation hearings.
   Siegan wrote that prayer in schools could be constitutional,
although the Supreme Court has said otherwise. He contended that
equal weight should be given to property rights and human rights.
He said framers of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees basic
freedoms, never intended its scope to be as broad as that defined
by the Supreme Court.
   Siegan also disagreed with the high court's reasoning in its
1954 decision outlawing school segregation, although he agreed with
the result.
   The landmark ruling, Siegan said, should have been based on the
right of black students to travel to the schools of their choice.
His critics said this would have left students at the schoolhouse
door, without guaranteeing a seat inside.
   Siegan, 63, was only the second judicial nominee to be rejected
by the Judiciary Committee since the Democrats regained control in
January 1987. Bork was the first.
   Although the two men disagreed on some areas of the law, both
wrote often from their positions as law school scholars. Bork went
on to become a federal appellate judge, although he resigned after
his defeat for the high court.
   Siegan, after a state court practice, went on to become a
professor. His lack of federal court experience was cited by
Democrats opposing him.
   ``He hasn't handled a case since I was 12 years old _ 36 years
ago,'' said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over
Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada,
Oregon, Washington, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.

   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen is promising to keep up
his push for trade legislation even though he expects to spend
considerable time on the vice presidential campaign trail.
   ``I'll be taking some of my time to work on that trade bill here
in the Senate,'' the Texan said Thursday at a meeting of his Senate
Finance Committee. He said he had ``talked to Governor Dukakis on
that'' and received approval to keep working on the trade measure.
   The measure was approved by the House on Wednesday and sent to
the Senate, where there could be floor action before mid-August.
   The decision by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis to tap
Bentsen as his running mate heightens prospects for Senate approval
of the legislation, in the view of some Democrats.
   In related action, a legislative blueprint for implementing the
U.S.-Canadian free trade agreement won approval Thursday from the
Finance Committee. The plan also cleared the House House Ways and
Means Committee.
   Tariffs between the two nations would be phased out over the
next 10 years under the agreement.
   Under special procedures reserved for international trade pacts,
the administration will now introduce implementing legislation that
follows closely the blueprint drawn up by the two committees.
   Congress guarantees in turn that the legislation gets speeded up
consideration, with amendments ruled out.
   Administration officials promised the Finance Committee that the
legislation would not include subsidies for the U.S. uranium
industry, which had been delaying action by the two committees.
   Both Bentsen and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., balked at the uranium subsidy plan. Other
squabbles also were settled and officials said the path appeared
clear for approval of the agreement and the bill.
   ``We've set an example for the entire world on what can be
accomplished with free trade,'' Bentsen said. ``This is a historic
moment.''
   Rostenkowski issued a statement saying the lawmakers had
``reached agreement among ourselves and with the administration on
the details of the implementing legislation.''
   ``I believe that this consultative process has developed a
sound, well crafted implementing bill, which balances all
interests,'' he said.
   ``It fully carries out our obligations under the agreement but
also protects the legitimate intrerests of those few industries
concerned about possible adverse effects on their current business
dealings,'' he said.

   U.S. and Soviet teams monitoring compliance
with the new medium-range missile treaty have found no violations
of the pact so far, says Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie, head of the
American inspection contingent.
   ``There have been no difficulties,'' Lajoie told reporters at
the Pentagon on Thursday. Lajoie, the chief of the U.S. On-Site
Inspection Agency, headed a team on the first round of American
on-site visits to the Soviet Union at the beginning of this month,
and was expected to begin the second U.S. round over the weekend.
   Four Soviet teams of 10 people arrived Thursday evening aboard a
special Ilyushin-62 at Dulles International Airport and were to
begin their second round of inspections today or Saturday.
   The sites the Soviets were expected to visit were a Martin
Marietta Corp. plant near Baltimore; Cape Canaveral, Fla.; the
Redstone Arsenal at Huntsville, Ala; Fort Sill, Okla.; and
possibily the Longhorn Army Depot at Marshall, Texas.
   Although U.S. and Soviet inspectors were a little wary at first,
said Lajoie, the process has gone smoothly since President Reagan
and Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev exchanged articles of
ratification in Moscow on June 1 and the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces treaty went into effect.
   During a 60-day period of ``baseline inspections,'' the Soviets
are visiting 30 sites in the United States and Western Europe, and
Lajoie and his team are inspecting 133 sites in the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe, to determine the accuracy of data exchanged by
the two sides.
   Under the treaty, which calls for elimination of all superpower
missiles with ranges of 340 miles to 3,000 miles over about three
years, the Soviet Union is to destroy about 6,000 items, consisting
of missiles and related components, and the United States is to
destroy 2,000 items, Lajoie said.
   With inspections about 25 percent complete, said Lajoie, ``the
count has been exactly on.''
   ``Inspectors tend to be congenitally suspicious, which is
probably a healthy attitude,'' he said. ``Both sides are wary that
the other will be concealing or hiding items. That has not been the
case on either side.''
   The on-site inspectors are confined to strictly defined areas
and do not have the right to roam through woods or caves looking
for hidden missiles.
   ``There are other sources that hopefully will give us the
confidence there is not something'' in areas inspectors cannot
visit, said Lajoie, alluding to satellites which take photographs
and collect electronic intelligence.
   ``It is too early in the life of this treaty to be philosophic
or to make grand pronouncements,'' he added.
   But Lajoie, who has served twice as military attache in Moscow
and once in Berlin, said ``there are some dramatic differences in
the Soviet Union from when I was there, leaving for the last time
in 1983, and the relationship I had with the Group of Soviet Forces
in Germany from '83 to '86.''
   Lajoie was in Germany in 1985 when Soviet soldiers fatally shot
Maj. Arthur D. Nicholson while the soldier visited East Germany,
and ``clearly there was a considerable tension in our relationship.
All of that is gone now.''
   The Soviets, under severe pressure from the United States,
apologized last month for shooting Nicholson.

<HEAD>Gap Grows Between Religious `Believers and Belongers'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The number of Americans who believe in the
divinity of Jesus Christ has increased in the last decade, but a
smaller percentage belong to organized churches, according to a new
Gallup Poll.
   ``The churches of America have made no headway in narrowing the
gap between religious belief and church involvement, between
believers and belongers,'' said the polling organization's
co-chairman, George Gallup, in previewing the survey results
Thursday.
   The nationwide survey, called ``The Unchurched American,'' found
that 84 percent of those surveyed believe Christ is either God or
the son of God, compared with 78 percent in a similar 1978 Gallup
Poll. The number of survey respondents declaring they were
``committed to Jesus Christ'' increased from 60 percent to 66
percent.
   Forty-four percent of respondents were classified as
``unchurched'' because they have not attended regular services in
six months, compared with 40 percent of those polled a decade ago.
   The survey projects that 61 million American adults did not
belong to any church in 1978, with the number increasing to 78
million today.
   While churchgoers tend to have stronger beliefs than those who
do not attend, the survey found considerable ``faith'' among the
unchurched, Gallup said at a news conference.
   The poll showed that 72 percent of those who do not attend
church believe in Christ, 77 percent believe in God, 63 percent
believe the Bible is inspired, 58 percent believe in an afterlife
and 25 percent say they have had a ``religious experience.''
   The $163,000 study, based on in-person interviews with 2,556
adults, was conducted by the Gallup Organization of Princeton,
N.J., for 22 major religious organizations and is to be distributed
at a National Festival of Evangelism in Chicago Aug. 4-7.
   Gallup said the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points, making the 10-year change in results on church
participation and religious belief statistically significant.
   ``One might maintain that churches have done well to keep
slippage at a minimum in view of the continued high mobility among
Americans during the last decade, the distractions of modern life,
and the apparent growing appeal of cults and non-traditional
religious movements,'' Gallup said.
   The percentage of all respondents who said they believe that
most churches are too concerned with organizational rather than
spiritual issues has grown from 51 percent in 1978 to 59 percent in
the new survey. And, 41 percent said they believe churches are not
concerned enough about social justice, compared to 35 percent in
the previous survey.
   Gallup said the survey found more criticism of churches from
those who attend than those who do not, but he did not give
details. Complete survey results are to be released at the Chicago
convention.
   There was no significant change over the 10-year period in the
view held by more than three-fourths of those surveyed that a
person can be a good Christian or Jew without attending a church or
synagogue. In both surveys, about 80 percent also said they believe
that a person ``should arrive at his or her religious beliefs
independent of any church or synagogue.''
   Paul Benjamin, executive director of the Chicago conference,
said the survey results showed little differences in opinions
between Protestants and Catholics. He said it was not possible to
break down the results by denominations because the individual
samplings were not large enough.
   He said religious leaders have yet to analyze the survey results
but they seem to indicate that while church membership has sagged,
Americans are ``deeply religious and the churches have a tremendous
opportunity to reach out.''
   ``Many times we churches are only concerned about our needs and
become self-centered and ingrown,'' Benjamin said.
   The poll interviewed more blacks and Hispanics than the
percentages existing in the general population in order to find if
there were any significant differences in responses by race, Gallup
said.
   It found no relationship between race and church status or
religious values, he said, but more black respondents said they had
``real religious experiences,'' believed more strongly in personal
freedom, and were critical of churches for inadequate commitment to
social justice.

   The political survey season is coming
mercifully to an end for the 6,438 Democratic and Republican
convention delegates who have had to endure 1,001 questions from
the news media. And so, too, for the rest of us who've suffered the
cumulative results.
   Is there a collective national amen?
   The delegates, chosen by their fellow party members to pick
candidates for president and vice president, were telephoned,
polled, interviewed, prodded, bothered, analyzed, classified,
categorized, pigeonholed, sorted, shuffled and mostly picked clean
for their opinions by newspapers, wire services, radio and
television. Then they were dissected by age, sex, race, voting
record, ethnicity, religion, region, income, education, height,
weight and pet ownership.
   As in, tall, red-haired female college graduates who own Great
Danes can be counted for George Bush. Or, perhaps, the other way
around.
   It was a Herculean task, draining considerable media talent, for
there are 4,161 delegates to next week's Democratic National
Convention and 2,277 to next month's Republican bash in New Orleans.
   The survey effort, which started with the selection of the first
Michigan Republican delegates in January, cries out for a summing
up.
   What made you hate surveys? How many calls did you get? How much
time did you spend on them? Whose survey did you like best, whose
least and what was the dumbest question you were asked, present
company excepted?
   ``I think questions about my race, religion and sex would be
illegal if the government asked them,'' said Republican delegate
Ben Bailey, the top aide to West Virginia governor Arch Moore. ``If
we in government asked those questions they would be considered
insulting or suspect.''
   Bob Douglas handled survey questions for his boss, Maryland Gov.
Donald Schaefer.
   ``Surveys have ranged from one paragraph to what look like FBI
grand inquisitions,'' was his answer to the survey of surveys. The
longest, he said, was the Los Angeles Times which spread its 132
questions over 16 pages and ``you virtually need a Ph.D. and two
weeks time to answer that survey.''
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste was asked Dukakis' strongest point.
   ``His record as governor.''
   Dukakis' weakest point?
   ``His record as governor,'' said Celeste.
   Of such stuff are trends discerned.
   ``There must be at least 50 surveys,'' said Jacksonville, Fla.,
attorney Steve Pajcic, a Dukakis delegate. ``It seems to me there
is more inefficiency in the media than there is in government.''
   Some people do exaggerate.
   ``There were too many surveys,'' groused John Willis, Maryland
state Democratic party vice chairman. ``You get some that are 15
and 20 minutes long. That's crazy.''
   Bernice Covilli, 61, of West Frankfort, Ill., was bothered by
the 20 or so interviewers who wouldn't accept her insistence on
being uncommitted.
   ``Who's your choice? Who's your choice?'' she mimicked.
   Illinois State Representative Monique Davis, a Jackson delegate,
was irritated by the ``what-if'' questions about vice presidential
possibilities. ``Finally, I just told one guy: Put down Jesse
Jackson every time you get to that question.''
   Delegate Carmen Canino, a Massachusetts Democrat who works for
the state welfare department, was reluctant to answer questions.
Then she wasn't crazy about question No. 1, her age. Then she
wanted to know if the questions had been cleared by the Democratic
Party. Then she hung up.
   Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts, accustomed to
interviews, was willing to answer questions until he found out it
was a survey. ``I'm not doing any of these,'' he said and hung up.
   Some delegates, it must be said, were flattered by the attention
and said things like ``Thank you for asking my opinion.'' The
survey of surveys failed to ask whether it was their first
interview or the 15th.
   As for the dumbest question, there were several candidates.
   ``How much money I plan to spend in Atlanta,'' said James P.
Jones, a super delegate from Virginia.
   ``What was it in Atlanta that I wanted to see more than anything
before I left,'' said Monique Davis, the indomitable Jackson
delegate. Her reply: ``I told them, `Jesse Jackson as the vice
president or the president.'''

   Eight years after Jimmy Carter left the White
House in defeat and despair, his long political exile is coming to
an end here in his native Georgia.
   No longer is he shunned by the Democratic establishment or
scorned as the hapless leader who turned over the keys of the White
House to Republican Ronald Reagan.
   With the Democratic convention threatened by discord, Jesse
Jackson turned to Carter to mediate his high-profile differences
with Michael Dukakis. ``He has earned respect of all of us,''
Jackson explained.
   Jackson said he wants Carter to play ``a real role'' in settling
the differences. ``He understands the equation,'' Jackson said.
   Carter will deliver an opening-night speech before the
Democratic convention on Monday. He is hosting receptions for the
media, former Cabinet members and other dignitaries.
   And, the Carter Presidential Center will be the site for many
convention-related activities, such as forums on domestic and
foreign policy issues.
   At long last, Carter is an undisputed elder statesman of the
party.
   Democratic chairman Paul Kirk said Americans have changed their
opinion about Carter after ``eight years of three-by-five cards and
hands-off government'' under Reagan.
   ``People understand the sincerity and the seriousness of purpose
and the enlightment of values and views that President Carter
brought to his administration,'' Kirk said.
   ``And I think he will be greeted and welcomed at the Democratic
convention as he should be _ just as a president whose roots were
planted and nutured here in Georgia but who made a great
contribution to values around the globe,'' Kirk said.
   Those must be sweet words to Carter, particularly since they
come from a man who wanted to see Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., not
Carter, as the Democratic nominee for president in 1980.
   It hasn't been easy for Carter since Reagan turned him out of
office in 1980, humiliating him with a 44-state sweep. Even after
losing the White House, Carter remained a favorite target of Reagan
and Republicans, blamed for the sagging economy and ridiculed by
George Bush for talking about America's ``malaise.''
   For a long while, Carter was remembered as the president who
left American hostages in Iran, the leader who authorized a rescue
attempt that ended in failure in the desert. He presided over a
nation that waited in long lines for gasoline and had to pay
double-digit interest rates for loans.
   But Reagan has had his setbacks, too: 242 servicemen killed in
Lebanon, Americans held hostage in Lebanon, record budget deficits,
the Iran-Contra scandal and, most recently, the picture of an
American warship shooting down a civilian airliner over the Persian
Gulf, killing 290 people.
   Perhaps these events have softened the Republican-promoted image
of Carter as inept.
   On the campaign trail, Bush, certain to be the Republican
presidential nominee, is likely to pass over Carter and talk about
``McGovern Democrats.''
   A relationship with Carter has proven not to be a political
liability, as evidenced by the election successes of former
administration members such as Carter's secretary of
transportation, Brock Adams, who won a Senate seat from Washington
state, and Andrew Young, former U.N. ambassador who now is mayor of
Atlanta.
   Though Carter's name is not frequently invoked by Michael
Dukakis, all of the Democrats who ran for president _ Dukakis
included _ made a pilgrimage to Georgia to pay respects this year.
   Carter's success is in marked contrast to that of another former
president, Richard Nixon. Fourteen years after Nixon resigned in
disgrace, he still avoids the Republican presidential conventions
and plays only a backstage role in offering occasional advice to
Reagan and Bush.

Jackson</HEAD>

   Black leaders say it is urgent that Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis heal his rift with Jesse
Jackson, the man he defeated, and they predict next week's party
convention could be ``on the wild and ragged side.''
   ``There has to be a real healing process set in motion,'' said
Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, adding that he would try to play
a role in reconciling the two sides in Atlanta.
   ``I'm concerned that the black community not feel that in
snubbing Mr. Jackson, Gov. Dukakis has snubbed them,'' Hooks said.
   ``Up to now the Jackson campaign has been healthy for the
Democratic party, and I see no reason why it shouldn't continue to
be healthy,'' said Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young.
   Black members of Congress planned a series of meetings for this
weekend and early next week aimed at reconciling the party's split
factions. Sessions were being set first with Jackson to develop a
unified strategy, then with Dukakis or his top aide, Paul Brountas.
   ``Clearly the way Jesse Jackson was dealt with, on a personal
basis, looms as a monumental issue,'' said Rep. Ron Dellums,
D-Calif. ``It speaks to how black people are perceived in this
election. He is the personification of the hopes of millions of
people. Whether Mr. Dukakis understands that or not is something
that remains to be seen.''
   Dellums said the snub gives the appearance that Dukakis is
courting conservatives who have been fickle to the Democratic party
and taking for granted the black voters who have been its most
loyal supporters.
   Several black leaders said they expect the path to
reconciliation to be rocky, and Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., vowed to
stage several protests, including a Monday march from the grave of
slain civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to the Omni
convention center.
   ``I think there's going to be a lot of confusion down in
Atlanta, a lot of pain down there,'' Dellums said.
   Added Hooks: ``It will be a little on the wild and ragged side.
But we'll leave there together.''
   Jackson and his supporters were stung by Dukakis' selection of
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen for the vice presidential spot on the
Democratic ticket, and the hurt was compounded when Jackson first
learned about the choice from reporters rather than directly from
Dukakis.
   Dukakis telephoned Jackson on Wednesday to try to mend the
damage, and Jackson said Thursday he had asked former President
Jimmy Carter to mediate between the two camps. Jackson also said he
got an apology from a top Dukakis aide but no apology from Dukakis.
He said he wasn't seeking one, though.
   The lawmakers said their concerns extended beyond the personal
tiff to the appearance that issues of concern to blacks were being
given short shrift.
   ``We are trying to salvage this,'' said Rep. Mervyn Dymally,
chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, acknowledging that
there is a wide range of intensity about the matter among the 23
black House members who make up the caucus. ``We are practical
politicians.''
   Some caucus members said they recognized the danger to their
political standing if Jackson appears to be going to the convention
purely as a spoiler, and Young hinted that Jackson should be ready
to compromise.
   ``This party has elected Michael Dukakis as its nominee,'' Young
said. ``His primary responsibility is to bring victory. He can't do
anything for Jesse Jackson or for me or the cities unless he wins
election.''
   The black caucus was working through Rep. Nicholas Mavroules,
D-Mass., to set up meetings with the Dukakis camp, and Mavroules
said he expected there to be a lengthy meeting, perhaps on Tuesday.
   ``I think it would be a very wise idea on the part of the
Dukakis people,'' Mavroules said. ``They can talk at length about
problems, about issues. And if they want, they can talk about the
Jackson thing. ... I would like very much if we could have a nice,
good, normal, united convention.''
   Mavroules said the members of the Congressional Black Caucus
``play a very key role. We need them with us. I think most of them
want this settled.''

   President Reagan, back from a look at what he
called the ``worst natural disaster since the Dust Bowl,'' is
sending a team headed by Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng on a
tour of 11 drought-stricken states from Tennessee to the Dakotas.
   Reagan inspected corn and soybean fields in southern Illinois on
Thursday and appealed to Congress to focus its attention on drought
relief, putting aside partisanship and efforts to rewrite the
overall farm laws.
   ``Politics must stop at the parched field's edge,'' Reagan said
in Davenport, Iowa, paraphrasing a traditional foreign policy
slogan that partisanship should stop at the water's edge.
   The president spoke at a luncheon in Davenport after inspecting
crop damage at the Du Quoin State Fair grounds and the nearby farm
of Herman Krone near Marion, Ill.
   ``We should keep our eye on the ball,'' he told the luncheon
audience. ``Drought relief should be just that, drought relief.''
   Both in Davenport and at the fair grounds, Reagan urged the
lawmakers to avoid amendments not relevant to the drought crisis.
   ``What I saw was not a pretty sight,'' Reagan said after walking
through the shriveled fields and viewing them from a helicopter.
   ``We can't make it rain but we can help to ease the pain, and
that's what the federal government will do,'' he told state
agriculture officials and farmers gathered at the fair grounds.
   ``From Montana to Texas, from California to Georgia, and right
here in Illinois, farmers face the worst natural disaster since the
Dust Bowl of the 1930s,'' the president said.
   On Air Force One flying back to Washington, Lyng said he and his
task force plan to visit 11 states, beginning next Tuesday. He
listed Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee, Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, North
Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin. He said he
would be accompanied by representatives of the Interior Department,
Army Corps of Engineers and several other agencies.
   Meanwhile in Washington, the Senate Agriculture Committee
approved a $5.5 billion drought relief bill after adopting 10
amendments. The corresponding committee of the House is considering
a similar bill.
   Lyng told reporters that the Senate bill appeared to be ``pretty
close to the package we've been talking about.''
   In Davenport, Reagan spoke at a luncheon sponsored by Radio
Station WOC and the local chamber of commerce after taking part in
65th anniversary observances of the station, where he began his
entertainment career as an announcer in the 1930s.
   In an interview with WOC, Reagan said he is waiting for the farm
relief bill. ``I will sign it the minute it is delivered to me,''
he said.

   Nobody really expected Jesse Jackson to go gently
into the campaign to win the White House for Michael Dukakis.
   And Jackson's grievances against the Democrat who defeated him
were inevitable. For Jackson, it's too soon to have them settled.
   Without his complaints _ notably Dukakis' failure to give him
advance word that Sen. Lloyd Bentsen would be the Democratic vice
presidential nominee _ there would be nothing but symbolism to keep
the campaign going.
   And Jackson has gone far beyond symbolism in his second campaign
for the presidency.
   In defeat, Jackson has risen higher in the realm of presidential
politics than any black man before him. He is not ready to end his
campaign quite yet.
   So as his convention cavalcade rolls from Chicago to Atlanta on
a final campaign bus tour, he is demanding a clear and influential
role in the campaign and in the councils of the Democratic Party.
   Dukakis says he'll have one. ``I want Jesse Jackson to be deeply
involved in the campaign as a party leader,'' the Massachusetts
governor said. ``I hope and expect that he will be.''
   Neither has defined the precise nature of the role or the deep
involvement. Precision is difficult if not impossible anyhow.
   Jackson says he is not satisfied. ``We are prepared to
deliberate and debate Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday,'' he said,
accounting for all the business sessions of the Democratic National
Convention.
   Lacking the vice presidential slights _ he isn't it and he
wasn't told of Bentsen _ Jackson would have had to find other
issues for debate, or lapse into silence, which is not his way.
   Now he's even involving innocent bystanders, as in the
suggestion that former President Jimmy Carter mediate his
differences with Dukakis. Carter declined to comment on that notion.
   The eventual settlement will be the drama of the Democratic
National Convention opening Monday, with all its decisions made in
advance. Debate is one thing; delegates are another. Dukakis has
more than 2,500 to Jackson's 1,150. Any time delegates vote,
Dukakis is in control. Jackson's claim that the floor will be
``wide open'' on a vice presidential nomination simply isn't so, on
any item of business.
   But Dukakis needs to claim his victory and enforce his decisions
without alienating the Jackson forces, doubly difficult and also
crucial, because he is dealing with a black leader and a
predominantly black constituency.
   ``Presently, I do not know the proposed strategy to win,''
Jackson said in Chicago on Thursday. ``At this point, my
constituency has no place on the team.''
   That constituency cannot be turned on and off at will, not even
by Jackson's command. This time the unity show that is the
traditional convention finale will have to be built on a base more
substantive than handshakes and victory waves.
   Jackson's supporters are echoing and escalating the complaint
that he heard from Dukakis on the Bentsen choice only after it had
been made public.
   ``It speaks to the way black people are perceived in this
election,'' said Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif. ``Whether Mr. Dukakis
understands that or not is something that remains to be seen.''
   Dukakis said he was sorry he hadn't been able to contact
everybody in advance, and noted that he had not reached Ohio Sen.
John Glenn, either. He has talked with Jackson by telephone at
least twice since announcing the Bentsen selection.
   The nominee-in-waiting is trying to be conciliatory without
appearing to surrender control of the convention and the party he
now leads. He needs Jackson's help _ and Jackson needs a continuing
role in the 1988 campaign.
   This is, after all, only the preliminary. The real prize will be
awarded on Nov. 8, Dukakis versus Vice President George Bush.
   The real test of whatever reconciliation Dukakis and Jackson
reach won't come in Atlanta. It will come in the campaign months
that follow.

   State budget problems are dogging Michael Dukakis
in the days before he travels to the Democratic National Convention
to receive his party's presidential nomination.
   While most of his headquarters campaign staff made a wholesale
move to the convention site in Atlanta on Thursday, Dukakis spent
most of the day in a search for ways to deal with deficits in
budgets for the current and past fiscal years.
   The governor and his fellow Democrats who dominate the state
legislature were determined to resolve the budget problems before
Dukakis heads for Atlanta on Sunday and deny Republicans an
opportunity to attack the Democratic candidate's claim to be an
efficient manager.
   ``The Atlanta express is rolling,'' Massachusetts House GOP
leader Steven Pierce said during the legislative budget debate.
``You Democrats want out of here. You don't (care) what happens to
the budget.''
   Vice President George Bush, who has clinched the Republican
presidential nomination, already has attacked Dukakis for approving
more than $100 million in new taxes as part of a budget-balancing
plan.
   While Dukakis was trying to clear his desk of state problems, he
also was confronted by threats to his goal of a party convention
that will reflect party unity.
   Jesse Jackson, saying ``I simply want respect and
responsibility,'' suggested that former President Jimmy Carter step
in and mediate differences between the Dukakis and Jackson camps.
   Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan, asked about Jackson's call for
mediation, said only that the two sides had been talking throughout
the campaign and would keep doing so.
   In Atlanta, Carter spokesman Carrie Harmon confirmed that Carter
had spoken with Jackson by telephone, but would not comment on
whether he would get involved in any mediation effort.
   Both Dukakis and his aides minimized the prospect that Jackson's
displeasure over the handling of Dukakis' selection of Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate would endanger party unity.
   But as he left Chicago on a bus caravan for Atlanta, Jackson
refused to rule out the possibility of a convention challenge to
the choice of Bentsen.
   Later, however, after his caravan arrived in Indianapolis,
Jackson said, ``We hope in the next three or four days that matters
will be resolved.''
   And Dukakis, asked during a CBS interview if he expected a
display of unity in Atlanta that would include Jackson, said ``I
expect that you will.''
   ``Democratic conventions seldom begin on a note of unity,'' said
senior Dukakis campaign aide Kirk O'Donnell. ``But in recent years
they have ended on one.''
   Dukakis, as he has done in the past, took a tough line toward
Jackson's complaints about his vice presidential selection process.
   ``Obviously in a contest like this somebody wins and somebody
loses and I'm the guy who's won and it's my job to go out and pick
a running mate,'' he said in the CBS interview.
   Jackson complained that he wasn't notified in advance of the
selection of Bentsen and learned of it from a reporter.
   Mark Gearan, a Dukakis spokesman, said the nominee-to-be called
Jackson on Wednesday. ``The governor obviously made it clear that
it was his own intention for the Reverend Jackson and all of the
candidates to hear the news from no one else but the governor,'' he
said.
   Gearan declined to say whether the governor had apologized.
   Jackson spokesman Ron Brown termed Dukakis' gesture an
``important call and a good start'' toward healing relations, but
made it clear he expects there will be a number of conversations
between the two men in the days ahead.
   Dukakis' only public foray outside the statehouse on Thursday
was a visit to two state troppers recovering from gunshot wounds
suffered in a drug raid.
   Outside Boston City Hospital, Dukakis, using a police cruiser as
a table, signed legislation toughening sentences for people
convicted of possession of cocaine.
   ``We're serious about a war on drugs in this state,'' said the
governor, sounding a familiar campaign theme.

<HEAD>Politics Played No Part In Bush's UN Appearance, Aides Insist</HEAD>

   George Bush is satisfied with his appearance
before the UN Security Council on the accidental U.S. downing of an
Iranian airliner in the Persian Gulf, but aides are reluctant to
say whether he will reap political advantage.
   But while Bush and his supporters insist that political
considerations did not figure in his Thursday appearance, the
assignment did provide the vice president with a high-profile forum.
   ``Any time you can go and speak forcefully about bringing peace
to this part of the world, it's worth doing,'' said Bush chief of
staff Craig Fuller. ``He didn't do it for political reasons. I do
not believe it will be harmful politically.''
   After an angry 1{-hour denunciation of the United States by
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati for ``barbaric acts,''
Bush told the world organization the United States felt grief for
the loss of innocent lives that ``transcends political differences
and boundaries.''
   But he also condemned Iran for allowing a civilian airliner
carrying 290 people ``to proceed on a path over a warship engaged
in battle'' and said Iran must share responsibility for the tragedy.
   Coming days before Democrats convene in Atlanta to install
Michael Dukakis as their presidential nominee, Bush's appearance
gave him high visibility in an area that he is presenting as one of
his strong suits: foreign policy.
   Still, it was the first time that Bush had been selected to
address the Security Council in his 7{ years as vice president,
even though he served there as U.S. ambassador under President
Richard Nixon in the early 1970s.
   Bush told reporters President Reagan had decided to give him the
assignment ``to put some real emphasis on the policy of the United
States by elevating the level of representation.''
   ``There's so much at stake, I'm not sure people have a heart for
talking about how it helps him politically,'' said campaign press
secretary Sheila Tate. ``This was serious business, it wasn't
politics.''
   Bush more subdued in his UN presentation than he has been in
recent public appearances when he characterized the July 3 disaster
as ``just an unhappy incident'' while telling audiences that ``life
goes on.''
   Departing from his prepared text, Bush turned to face Velayati
across the semi-circular council table. Speaking in a calm voice,
the vice president said: ``Of course we feel badly about it, of
course we have compassion. Of course we care.''
   Aides said that Bush's presentation was written by three or four
White House speechwriters, with most of the ideas for its wording
coming from him. The text was coordinated with both the State
Department and the National Security Council before Bush delivered
it, the aides said.
   Fuller, his chief of staff, would not confirm speculation that
Bush himself had proposed the assignment to Reagan, saying only
that he and Reagan had worked out the arrangements.
   Fuller told reporters on Air Force II after Bush's appearance
that the vice president ``feels very good about'' the way his
20-minute address to the world forum came across.
   It was Bush's last scheduled public appearance until next
Wednesday, when he begins a six-day campaign swing.
   He has no public events planned for today, and on Saturday he
leaves for a 4{-day fishing trip at a remote, undisclosed location
in Wyoming with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, a close
friend and adviser.
   Bush on Thursday also gave his first public reaction to the
naming by Dukakis as former rival Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his running
mate, beyond a cryptic ``that's interesting'' on the day of the
announcement.
   He called the selection of Bentsen ``an unusual choice'' but
told reporters aboard Air Force Two he did not think it would hurt
him politically, even in his adopted state of Texas. Bentsen
defeated Bush in a 1970 Senate race.
   Asked if the selection would make him campaign harder for Texas'
29 electoral votes, Bush said, ``I don't know. I certainly won't
lighten up.''
   ``I plan to spend a lot of time in Texas anyway. I am certainly
not going to take Texas for granted and I will win Texas.''
   ``The race is going to be determined, as I said in 1980 and as I
said in 1984, by the top of the ticket. That's what will determine
it in Texas and elsewhere.''

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen is predicting that he and
Michael Dukakis will triumph over Republican George Bush this fall
in the vice president's adopted home state of Texas. But he's not
claiming it will be easy.
   ``I think it will be close. I think it will be tough, but I
think we'll win it,'' the Texas senator said Thursday.
   ``Vamos a ver,'' he said _ Spanish for ``We're going to see.''
   One new poll suggested that Dukakis' choice of Bentsen as his
running mate went down well with Texans. Dukakis pulled even with
Bush in the state after picking Bentsen, CBS News reported Thursday
night.
   Its poll of 580 registered voters on Tuesday and Wednesday found
48 percent supporting Dukakis to 44 percent for Bush. With a margin
of error of four percentage points, that is statistically a dead
hea.
   Polls that were taken before Dukakis picked Bentsen had found a
big Bush lead in Texas.
   Bentsen deferred to his new political partner on Thursday on the
matter of mending the rift with Jesse Jackson, who had lobbied for
the vice presidential nomination.
   ``I know he (Dukakis) has a high regard for Reverend Jackson. I
assume he'll have a meeting with Jackson,'' Bentsen said in a
session with reporters from his home state.
   Bentsen said he believed he was chosen as Dukakis' running mate
because of his legislative experience ``which exposes you to so
many facets of this country of ours,'' his proven ability to work
with Congress, and his exposure through the years to various heads
of state.
   A senator since 1970, Bentsen is being opposed in his
re-election bid this year by Rep. Beau Boulter, a Republican who
has been fighting an uphill battle in the race. Bentsen is legally
allowed to run for both races under a law passed in Texas that
allowed Lyndon B. Johnson to run for vice president with John F.
Kennedy as well as the Senate.
   Bentsen could remove his name from the Senate ballot before
Sept. 6, but the Democrats could not replace him. Boulter says
Bentsen's dual candidacy is unethical.
   If Bentsen wins both elections, he would have to choose one post
or the other. If he gave up his Senate seat, as expected,
Republican Gov. Bill Clements would name an interim senator and
then call a special election to pick someone to complete the
six-year term.
   Already, Texas politicians were moving to stake out a possible
candidacy in the event of such a special election.
   Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby said he would ``certainly seriously
consider'' running if such a special election takes place. State
Agriculture Commissioner John Hightower also said he'd consider a
Senate race. Hightower already had been looking at a 1990 race
against Republican Sen. Phil Gramm.
   Among other Democrats looking to enter the fray are former Gov.
Mark White and Reps. Mike Andrews and Mickey Leland, both of
Houston, and John Bryant of Dallas. Attorney General Jim Mattox
also has expressed interest.
   On the Republican side, Reps. Jack Fields of Houston and Steve
Bartlett of Dallas have shown interest.
   The 1961 special election to replace Johnson in the Senate drew
more than 70 candidates. Republican John Tower won.

<BYLINE>Army Engineers Reject Diversion of Great Lakes Water to
Mississippi</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers says it
turned down a request for emergency diversion of Great Lakes water
to the drought-depleted Mississippi River because the action would
do little to help shipping.
   The decision was based on analysis of water flow and economic
considerations, said Robert Page, the Army's assistant secretary
for civil works, after testifying Thursday before the Senate
merchant marine subcommittee. ``It was not politically motivated,''
Page said.
   Illinois Gov. James Thompson and other officials whose states
have an economic stake in the Mississippi asked last month for an
increase in water flow from the lakes to the river from 3,000 cubic
feet per second to 10,000 cubic feet per second.
   They asked that the increased flow continue for 100 days.
   The officials said increasing the flow would enable barge
traffic to resume movement down the Mississippi. The river's level
has fallen because of the drought, and some 3,000 barges were
reported stranded as a result.
   Barge shippers have estimated losses as a result of the stalled
shipping at up to $60 million.
   But Page said increasing the outflow to 10,000 cubic feet per
second would not do much to help Mississippi navigation, and shoals
would continue to impede the flow of goods.
   ``We will still have flow'' on the Mississippi'' through the
summer, he said. ``We see in the foreseeable future based on our
forecast we don't need (increased diversion) at all.''
   Don Vonnahme, director of water resources for the Illinois
Department of Transportation, said the agency had no problems with
the decision.
   ``If they feel the waters wouldn't do any good, then we
certainly wouldn't want to take them out of the lake,'' he said.
   Great Lakes state senators praised the decision.
   The corps' position ``gives us more ammunition in the continuing
struggle to prevent any diversion,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, a
Michigan Democrat. ``I have maintained that we should explore
alternatives to diversion, such as lightening the loads on barges
or utilizing truck or rail for transporting goods.''
   Sen. Donald Riegle, a Michigan Democrat, said ``this decision
will let us protect our water, conserve it, and use it in the
proper ways in the future.''
   The governors of four Great Lakes states opposed the diversion,
and only Thompson supported it among the leaders of the eight
states surrounding the lakes. Canadian officials also protested the
proposed diversion.
   Supporters of diversion argued the increased flow out of the
lakes would have a minuscule impact on the Great Lakes but would
have great benefits downriver.
   Opponents argued that the lakes water was needed in the Midwest
and Northeast, increasing diversion would set an unacceptable
precedent, and the federal government could not increase diversion
without the concurrence of all eight governors of Great Lakes
states.

<HEAD>Reagan Expected to Sign Disaster Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan appears all but certain to
sign a disaster bill containing payments of up to $100,000 for
drought-stricken farmers, the Senate Agriculture Committee chairman
says.
   ``The prospects are virtual certitude that there will be a
drought bill,'' Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., said Thursday after
the committee approved a blueprint that could cost up to $7 billion
or even more.
   ``We assured the president that we would stay within the budget
and we will,'' Leahy said.
   Reagan said after touring drought-stricken Illinois cornfields
with Gov. James R. Thompson that he was ``a little edgy'' about
proposed amendments that flooded into the Agriculture Committees
Wednesday night. But he said he stood ready to approve the basic
legislation.
   ``I will sign it the minute it is delivered to me,'' Reagan said
in an interview on radio station WOC in Davenport, Iowa. He said in
a speech that lawmakers should not use the bill as an excuse to
rewrite farm programs.
   ``Drought relief should be just that, drought relief,'' Reagan
said. ``Partisanship should be kept out of the issue of drought
relief. Politics must stop at the parched field's edge.''
   The government, meanwhile, declared Ohio and Missouri disaster
areas because of the drought, making farmers in those states
eligible for emergency low-interest loans, officials from both
states said.
   Thomas Dayley, spokesman for the Agriculture Department, said
the disaster designation had been requested by the governors of the
two states.
   Other states logged as of Thursday for official designation
were: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Idaho, Iowa,
Minnesota, Montana, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.
   In Washington, Leahy and Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., said at
a news conference that best-guess estimates placed the cost of aid
to crop growers at around $5.5 billion and to livestock producers
at $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
   Overall drought costs, however, could be considerably higher
than that, with farm analysts saying the cost of an avalanche of
federal crop insurance claims alone could reach $1 billion.
   The bill would provide farmers with disaster payments capped at
$100,000 for 65 percent of pre-drought expected earnings on crop
losses in excess of 35 percent of their historical yields.
   And both committees are studying ways to enrich the formula a
bit for the hardest hit farmers in the Grain Belt.
   In putting on the finishing touches, senators added special
provisions that could aid key industries.
   One such plan would allow corn refiners who produce ethanol fuel
to buy corn from federal stocks at 110 percent of the government's
cost of acquisition. Influenced by drought, crop prices have
skyrocketed since much of the corn was acquired. Under the bill,
ethanol producers could buy up to 2 million bushels each every
month.
   Senators said the bill's costs could be offset by government
savings, primarily a reduction in deficiency payments due to the
drought.
   These payments to growers of wheat, corn, cotton, rice and a few
other crops represent the difference between the value of a
farmer's harvest at the market and its value at a so-called target
price set by Congress.
   The budget calls for $17 billion in spending by the
government-owned Commodity Credit Corp. for deficiency payments and
price-support loans.
   But the market price of corn is now more than the target price
and that would automatically mean a dramatic slash in program costs
the market prices held for the rest of the year. Even if not,
though, the cost to the government is going to be much smaller than
expected. Estimates of the savings range from $5 billion to $10
billion.
   Many farmers, however, already have received up to 40 percent of
their deficiency payments in advance and, unless rescued by
legislation, will have to refund all or part at a time when they
have much reduced income. The bill would allow them to keep what
they have received in advance.
   Emergency feed programs for livestock producers would be
expanded and capped at $50,000 for each individual, and a planned
50-cent per hundredweight cut in dairy price supports set for next
year would be called off.

<HEAD>`Have a Beer For Us,' Satisfied Party Chief Tells Construction
Workers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The construction crews are still at work, but the
hall where Michael Dukakis will claim his Democratic presidential
nomination next week is complete enough for party officials to
begin to breathe easier.
   Easy enough, anyway, to feel assured the whole thing will be in
place by Monday's opening gavel and easy enough to bring the
construction workers into the delegates' chairs Thursday for a
little ceremonial ribbon-cutting.
   ``When you're at home watching this convention, having a Bud or
whatever, have one for us,'' Democratic party chief Paul Kirk told
the assembled workers, who were treated to plastic-wrapped
sandwiches on the floor of Atlanta's Omni Coliseum.
   ``Don't take for granted it was just another day's work,'' he
said. ``It's a page in history.''
   The towering walls of podiums, risers, camera platforms and
network studios inside what is otherwise home for the Atlanta Hawks
basketball team are impressive. But the built-in features are so
big that the hall itself _ cramped anyway by arena standards _
seems amazingly small.
   In fact, the convention floor isn't big enough. More than half
the 4,212 delegates will be in bleachers halfway up the side of the
arena.
   The inside of the hall looks like nothing if not a television
set. That is basically what it is.
   ``I approached it from that standpoint,'' said Rene Lagler, a
California television set designer who planned the convention
interior.
   Lagler also came up with the color scheme. He says it's red,
white and blue, but to others it looks like pink, gray and pale
blue _ colors that the party officials say will look less harsh on
television screens.
   ``On camera the whole thing will look red, white and blue,'' he
said. ``Just squint: that's what it will look like on television.''
   Some squinters, however, found the colors remained pink, gray
and pale blue.
   Kirk and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young showed off the fancy
moveable podium sections. They are controlled with hydraulic lifts
by a stage manager who will sit behind the speakers _ and adjust to
compensate for the speaker's height. Nominee-to-be Dukakis is five
foot eight.
   Overhead, lights swiveled by remote control, as they will when
the convention begins, and canned music poured from giant speakers
that were sniffed by bomb-detecting dogs before they were lifted
overhead. For delegates in seats so remote they can't see, giant
television screens will provide a view.
   Mike McCurry, the convention's director of communications, said
that while all looks pretty close to completion, there are constant
demands for adjustments.
   ``I walked in here yesterday and thought, `My Lord, they're not
going to be ready,''' McCurry said. ``But they've done a lot in two
days.''
   Even as the ribbon was cut, however, television microwave
receivers were still being installed above studio ``skyboxes'' that
allow anchor people to look down on the whole spectacle. There was
a din of resumed hammering and sawing.
   A workman in shorts scaled a rope ladder and crawled along a
suspension system near the 12-story-high ceiling, adjusting the
focus of lights to please technicians below.
   Just off the floor is the Hawks' office, where general manager
Stan Kasten declared the hall unrecognizable. ``It's amazing,'' he
said.
   Most of the 13,500 or so journalists won't even get in the hall,
or will only part of the time. They're being accommodated in the
vast Georgia World Congress Center, dubbed the ``Media Village.''
There's plenty of room _ but it's across the street from where the
action is.
   Outside, scores of satellite uplink trucks were being put in
place, their dish antennas pointed skyward. There's a mobile-home
village of network equipment _ and the handful of trailers the
Dukakis and Jackson campaigns each will use as command posts.
   Back inside, Lagler was looking over his labors when one of his
hard-hatted workers came up with a question: When was the meeting
to discuss tearing it all down after Thursday night?
   ``That'll be another problem,'' Lagler said, ``getting all this
out of here.''

   John Zaccaro Jr., the son of former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, is appealing his
conviction for selling $25 worth of cocaine to an undercover
officer.
   Attorneys for Zaccaro filed the brief notice in Vermont District
Court in Rutland on Thursday, indicating an appeal of both
Zaccaro's conviction and sentence, said Court Clerk Ann Dingler.
   The case now goes to the Vermont Supreme Court for final review.
   Zaccaro, 24, has already begun serving his four-month sentence
under a special house arrest program.
   The former Middlebury College student was convicted in April by
a jury of selling the drug to former Trooper Laura Manning.

<TEXT>
   South Korea called Friday for student
exchange visits with communist North Korea to help ease tension and
establish relations, but the North refused to accept the proposal.
   Education Minister Kim Young-shik proposed an exchange visit and
``pilgrimage'' in which about 1,000 students from each nation would
march across the other's territory to promote peace.
   ``It would help restore a sense of national trust and identity
among the young generation and provide a foothold for multilateral
nation exchanges,'' Kim said in a nationally broadcast speech.
   South Korean officials, who spoke on condition of not being
identified, said the North Korean government refused Thursday night
to agree to receive a letter on Friday outlining the student
exchanges. The North said the plan was pointless, they said.
   President Roh Tae-woo of South Korea on July 7 unveiled a plan
to end the confrontation between the pro-Western South and the
communist North by broad political, trade, cultural and
humanitarian exchanges. Roh said the plan could lead to eventual
peaceful reunification.
   But North Korea rejected the Roh proposal as pointless. ``This
is nothing new and not worth examination,'' North Korea said in a
July 11 statement.
   The two Koreas have no relations and the border is sealed. The
two nations technically are still at war since no peace treaty was
signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953.
   Both governments say they want reunfication, but on their terms.
Each side insists it is the only legitimate Korean government and
most observers doubt there will be any dramatic change in relations.
   The education minister proposed the two sides hold talks by the
end of July on a plan to allow about 1,000 students from each
nation to march sometime this year. Roh had said in June that he
would call for student exchange visits with the North.
   North Korea has said no need exists for government involvement
and student exchanges and meetings should be independent. Its
position is designed to support radicals in the South, even though
any North Korean student delegation would be under strict Communist
Party control.
   South Korean students would march from the border across North
Korea to Mount Paektu on the Chinese border. North Korean students
would march across the south to Mount Halla on the southern island
of Cheju.
   The march could clear the way for sports events between colleges
in the North and South involving about 200 students, Kim said. The
first sports event would be in Pyongyang in October, followed by a
second sports meet in Seoul next April, he said.
   If the first exchanges are a success, Kim said they could be
expanded to cultural and artistic exchanges and tours by students
from both nations.
   The Roh government issued the call for improved relations after
South Korean radical students demanded immediate reunification. The
government used riot police to stop thousands of students marching
to the border June 10 for talks with North Korean student delegates.
   Roh's administration was caught offguard on the issue as people
debated reunification. It has since attempted to catch up on the
issue.
   But Roh's proposals were similar or identical to past iniatives
by both governments since 1971 on improving relations. All failed
to produce results. The two Koreas arranged small-scale family
reunification visits and cultural exchanges in 1985.
   North Korea, which has staged a number of attacks on the South
over the years, is demanding to act as co-host at the Olympic Games
in Seoul this September. Olympic authorities rejected the demand
and the North said it will boycott the games.
   The Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by U.S. and Soviet
forces that ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War
II. The North invaded the South in 1950 and set off the three-year
Korean War. The United States and other nations fought for the
South under the United Nations flag, opposed later in the conflict
by Chinese forces.

<HEAD>Parents Wrongly Assume Bathtubs Safe For Unattended Toddlers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many parents incorrectly assume it's safe to
leave babies older than 9 months alone in the bathtub, says a study
that found old people and children face a similar risk of drowning
in tubs and swimming pools.
   Doctors should remind parents ``that the bathtub is still a
potentially lethal place and that the child should not be left
alone even for brief periods,'' the researchers wrote in today's
issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``We're recommending parents just let the phone or doorbell
ring, or wrap the child in a towel and take them with them,'' said
study co-author Dr. Ellen Alkon, a pediatrician at the Los Angeles
County Department of Health Services.
   Researchers also found that 89 percent of all Los Angeles County
drowning victims age 2 to 3 died in private swimming pools. They
said that figure underscores the hazard of pools without
self-latching fences and pools where house walls with doors serve
as one side of the fence.
   More surprising is that ``we may not have appreciated it isn't
just toddlers and infants for whom swimming pools and bathtubs are
a hazard,'' said Dr. Patrick W. O'Carroll, an epidemiologist at the
national Centers for Disease Control. ``These represent potential
drowning sites for the elderly.''
   O'Carroll conducted the study with Alkon, the county's medical
director for public health programs, and Billie Weiss, a county
epidemiologist. They analyzed coroner's records of 1,587 drowning
deaths in Los Angeles County from 1976 through 1984.
   The study found that 44.5 percent of the drownings occurred in
private pools and 15.6 percent in bathtubs.
   But among children who drowned before age 2, 55 percent died in
private pools and 25 percent in bathtubs. Among people who drowned
after their 70th birthday, 50 percent died in private pools and 36
percent in bathtubs.
   ``It was a surprise,'' said Alkon. ``It does suggest that maybe
the elderly should think about having somebody around when they're
swimming'' and perhaps when bathing.
   A review of death certificates from the two years covered by the
study found that, of bathtub drowning victims younger than 2, none
were younger than 9 months.
   ``Parents begin to think it's safe at about 9 months, and it
clearly isn't,'' Alkon said.
   About 5,300 people drown annually in the United States, and
there are up to three times as many near-drownings, O'Carroll said
by phone from Atlanta.
   One-third of near-drownings result in moderate to severe brain
damage, Dr. James Orlowski of Cleveland wrote in an accompanying
editorial, which said pool deaths have made drowning ``an accident
of affluence.''
   Alkon and O'Carroll said Los Angeles' County's drowning rate is
lower than the national average, probably because the county has
relatively few lakes and rivers. County and national rates have
dropped in recent years for unknown reasons, they said.
   O'Carroll blamed Los Angeles County's inadequate enforcement of
pool-fencing laws, its warm climate and numerous pools for the fact
that 44.5 percent of its drownings occurred in pools, 4{ times the
national average. Alkon said enforcement has been much more
vigorous since 1984.
   The study shows drowning prevention programs must focus on the
pattern of drowning in each local area, O'Carroll said. For
example, Los Angeles County's high proportion of pool drownings
contrasts with studies showing 70 percent of drownings in Georgia,
Maryland and New Mexico occur in lakes, rivers and other freshwater
bodies, he said.
   In addition to the 15.6 percent of county drownings in bathtubs,
17 percent occurred in the ocean, 11 percent in freshwater lakes or
streams, 3.8 percent in public pools, 2.1 percent in reservoirs, 2
percent in hot tubs and 4 percent in other sites, including basins
and toilets.

   A Cabinet minister was hit by a rock Thursday
when his car was stoned as he drove through the Israeli-occupied
West Bank, where the army imposed or mantained curfews on several
towns and refugee camps.
   The military administration in the West Bank meanwhile ordered
closed all eight Palestinian schools in Qalqiliya and 15 schools in
nearby Tulkarem until the end of the school year following student
riots, the army said.
   The army reopened 800 West Bank schools on Monday for the first
time in a week. The schools were closed because the army views them
as a focal point of the 7-month-old Palestinian uprising in which
222 Palestinians and four Israelis have died.
   Yosef Shapiro, a minister without portfolio, said on Israel
radio that when his car was stoned near Hebron, ``One stone went
inside and hit me. But we are strong people, and therefore we threw
out the stone and continued to drive.''
   He said it was the third time his car came under Palestinian
attack in the occupied lands.
   ``I think that the government could have done more original and
aggressive things, and in time, so we would not witness these riots
for such a long time,'' the right-wing minister added.
   The army clamped a curfew on Ein Yabrud near Ramallah in the
West Bank after a student protest broke out in the village, Israel
radio reported.
   It said Anabta and Beit Sahur villages; the western part of
Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, and Askar and Aida refugee
camps were also under curfew.
   The army also imposed a curfew on Qalqiliya, where a 12-year-old
boy from the Jewish settlement Ginot Shomron was struck in the head
by a rock Wednesday night. The boy was uncsoncious for hours but
was reported in good condition Thursday.
   Dozens of enraged Jewish settlers tried to enter Qalqiliya after
the attack but were turned away by soldiers, the army said. The
army was investigating reports that windows of three Arab-owned
cars there were smashed.
   Leaders of the Palestinian uprising have called on residents of
the occupied territories, which were taken by Israel from Jordan
and Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day War, to give Palestinian schools
nationalistic names.
   In the biblical West Bank city of Bethlehem, the Nativity School
became Palestinian Eagles School and Bethlehem School is now called
Palestinian Revolution School.
   In east Jerusalem, police arrested a 16-year-old Arab caught
throwing an empty bottle at an Israeli bus, one of about six such
incidents in the city Thursday morning. No one was hurt, a police
spokesman said.
   In central Israel, a small bomb apparently planted by
Palestinian militants exploded just outside Tel Aviv University,
but caused no casualties or damage, police said.
   In Haifa, a district court sentenced an Israeli Arab, Ali Nasser
of Araba village, to 15 months in prison and 18 months suspended
sentence after finding him guilty of erecting a roadblock and
raising outlawed flags of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Police in Beirut, Lebanon, said Moslem guerrillas fired nine
rockets into an Israeli military outpost near Marjeyoun in south
Lebanon before dawn on Thursday. They said the attack was in the
eastern sector of Israel's self-proclaimed security zone, but that
no casualty report was available.
   The police said that hours later, about 40 Israeli troops in
seven armored personnel carriers advanced into Jabal al-Dahr, a
mountainous area north of the security zone, and strafed the area
with machine-gun fire.
   They said three guerrillas were killed Wednesday when Israeli
soldiers and allied Lebanese militiamen of the South Lebanon Army
clashed with Hezbollah fighters in Libbaya, two miles from Jabal
al-Dahr.
   The police said Mohammed Bjaiji, commander of the pro-Iranian,
Shiite Moslem Hezbollah organization in southeast Lebanon, was
among those killed.
   Israel said it lost one soldier in the search-and-destroy
mission Wednesday.

   The persistent Veterans' Peace
Convoy went through one Mexican customs station Thursday after
crossing the Rio Grande with 14 trucks and a school bus in defiance
of a U.S. trade embargo with Nicaragua.
   ``They're on their way south,'' said Tom Hansen, a spokesman for
the group that opposes U.S. policies toward Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government.
   Convoy members were later delayed for a time at a secondary
customs area after Mexican authorities discovered firecrackers in
one of the vehicles, an official said.
   The firecrackers, which were left over from the Fourth of July,
were disposed of and weren't the main cause of the delay, said
Juanita Singer, a convoy spokeswoman in Laredo, Texas.
   Convoy organizers spent much of the day arranging for escorts to
accompany the trucks to the Guatemala border, which are required of
any imports being taken through Mexico in unsealed trucks, she
said. Non-convoy trucks passing through the customs station also
were required to arrange for escorts, she added.
   The convoy paid about $650 for two guards Thursday evening and
headed for Saltillo, Mexico, about 3{ hours away.
   On at least three separate occasions, the U.S. Treasury
Department has blocked the group's trucks from leaving the United
States, contending that taking the vehicles to Nicaragua would
violate a 3-year-old trade embargo.
   The government maintains the food and medical supplies qualify
as humanitarian aid exempt from the Nicaraguan Trade Control
Regulations, but that the vehicles are not humanitarian aid. Convoy
members disagree.
   Eight ``convoyistas'' were arrested Saturday in a tense
confrontation with U.S. Customs officials, Border Patrol agents and
Laredo police after Customs refused to let the convoy cross the
border.
   One of the eight was rearrested early Monday and charged with
blocking traffic at the same bridge when Customs again refused to
let him cross.
   Later Monday, however, the group said it started crossing
vehicles and finally drove the last one across Wednesday. The group
said the first 11 passed without question, while the last four were
told to provide personal and vehicle identification.
   ``A very funny thing that happened was that different officials,
police and border and treasury officials ran into us in Laredo and
different places and advised us to go one at a time late at
night,'' said convoy spokesman Jay Singer. ``And so we tried it and
it worked.''
   ``They `mace' us, they arrest us, they break our windows, they
impound our vehicles _ and then all of a sudden they let us pass,''
said convoy coordinator Raul Valdez, 40, of Austin.
   Valdez said he drove ``Pathfinder,'' the lead convoy vehicle,
directly past U.S. Customs officials and paid his 75-cent bridge
toll at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday. The truck was involved with all three
incidents at which U.S. Customs has blocked the group's exit.
   Customs spokeswoman Donna De La Torre said Thursday that the
convoy had crossed into Mexico without the knowledge or approval of
the U.S. government, and that the group still faces possible
prosecution if it does not return the vehicles within 30 days.
   Violating the Nicaraguan Trade Control Regulations could mean
fines of up to $50,000 and up to 10 years in prison.
   Some of the vehicles bear signs and brightly painted slogans,
including a multicolored school bus emblazoned with, ``Veterans
Peace Convoy to Nicaragua,'' and ``Bikes, Not Bombs.''
   Ms. De La Torre said the government's policy toward the convoy
had not changed.
   Last month, a convoy attempt to cross with 38 vehicles and 106
people was blocked by customs officials who stood in the roadway
and temporarily detained four of the group's trucks. The activists
then drove to Washington, D.C., tried unsuccessfully to meet with
federal officials and returned to Laredo last Friday.
   The convoy is sending some 300 tons of supplies by ship. About
10 tons of supplies were loaded on the vehicles when the group
arrived in Laredo last week for its second attempt at crossing the
border.

Lebanese group called the Organization of Martyrs paid for his
visit to Islamic holy places in Iran.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, told the court Thursday that
he visited Islamic holy sites at Qom and Mashhad, traveling via
Tehran. Asked by the judge to give a date for his trip, Hamadi
first said he could not remember but later said it could have been
in 1985.
   Hamadi has said he spent two years as a fighter with the Amal
militia in Beirut, but has repeatedly denied being a member of
Hezbollah, a radical, Iran-backed Shiite Moslem group in Lebanon.
   The group is believed to be an umbrella organization for
kidnappers holding foreign hostages in Lebanon. One of Hamadi's
brothers, Abdul-Hadi, is Hezbollah's security chief.
   The TWA jetliner was hijacked in June 1985 on a flight from
Athens to Rome.
   U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem of Waldorf, Maryland, was shot
and killed after the hijackers forced the plane to land in Beirut.
Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage during the 17-day ordeal.
   A court document introduced Thursday also indicated that Hamadi
was being sought on a murder charge in Beirut in 1983.
   The document, read by Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger, gave no
details. Hamadi said he was not aware of the charges.
   The document was obtained after West German federal
investigators asked authorities in Lebanon for assistance in their
investigation of Hamadi.
   Hamadi's defense attorneys questioned the value of the document
as evidence, saying it was an unsigned telex with few details.
   Hamadi also said that he smuggled explosives into West Germany
because he was afraid of ``committing a sin'' against Islam.
   ``I did not say no because I'm a Moslem and its my duty to obey
those who are wiser,'' Hamadi said, referring to a man he said
ordered him to smuggle liquid explosives into West Germany.
   ``The Koran says obey Allah, obey the prophet and obey those who
give you orders. I was afraid of committing a sin if I did not
accept.''
   He refused to identify the man who ordered him to smuggle the
explosives.
   On Wednesday, Hamadi admitted bringing explosives into West
Germany on two occasions. He was arrested at Frankfurt airport in
January 1987 when liquid explosives were found in his luggage, but
he said he had succeeded in smuggling another shipment a few weeks
earlier.
   In other testimony, Hamadi said he fought in southern Lebanon
against Israeli forces and took part in street battles in Beirut
against ``government soldiers'' and Christian Phalangist militiamen
in Lebanon between 1984 and 1987.
   He said he had been wounded in the arm by a bullet in streeting
fighting in 1985, but could not remember if his arm was still in a
cast in June, when the hijacking took place.
   Hamadi has testified that he was a member of the Shiite Moslem
Amal militia from 1980 to 1982. He said he also took part in
fighting during that period.
   He arrived in West Germany late in 1982 and applied for
political asylum, but returned to Lebanon in November 1984 after
his request was turned down.
   West Germany last year rejected a U.S. request for Hamadi's
extradition.
   A Duesseldorf court sentenced one of his brothers, Abbas Ali
Hamadi, to 13 years in prison in April for the January 1987
kidnappings of two West Germans in Beirut in an attempt to gain
Mohammed's freedom.
   The trial is scheduled to continue on Tuesday.

   A nursing-home worker indicted on charges he
raped nine elementary-school girls now claims he has assaulted as
many as 60 children in the last nine years, a spokeswoman for the
county prosecutor said Thursday.
   Anthony Johnson, 22, is ``one of the greater threats to female
children in Chicago who has ever lived,'' said Cook County Criminal
Court Judge Michael Bolan in ordering Johnson held without bond.
   ``We told the judge that in the course of his confession,
Johnson said that he could have assaulted or raped 50 or 60 girls
since the age of 13,'' Lisa Howard of the state's attorney's office
said Thursday.
   ``If any person should be held without bail, it's him,'' Bolan
said at a hearing Wednesday for Johnson.
   Johnson admitted raping eight of the girls aged 6 to 9 who were
cited in the indictment and possibly the ninth, said Assistant Cook
County State's Attorney Paula Becker.
   ``He can't remember all his victims,'' she said.
   There was no comment Thursday from Johnson's attorney, Howard
Towles. The telephone at his office went unanswered.
   The prosecutor's office announced Johnson's indictment Wednesday
on nine counts of criminal sexual assault, as well as on counts of
aggravated unawful restraint and armed violence.
   According to the indictment, the nine victims were assaulted on
the South Side between January and June 24. They were forced into
abandoned buildings and raped after being threatened with death if
they did not cooperate, prosecutors said.
   A knife and brass knuckles were brandished in one of the
attacks, Ms. Howard said. Ms. Becker said police recovered brass
knuckles from Johnson's home.
   He was arrested July 6 after a 9-year-old raped in April
identified him on the street while she rode in a car with her
mother.
   Johnson told police he worked as an orderly for Avenue Care
Center, a South Side nursing home. A woman who answered the phone
there Thursday said an orderly by that name had not been to work in
several days.
   Johnson's arraignment was scheduled for Aug. 4.

<HEAD>Pasta Resistance: Italy Loses Its Noodle Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The land of pure pasta and taut tortellini is afraid
that Italians won't be using the old noodle anymore.
   Italy, the mecca of macaroni since the days of Marco Polo, is
bracing for what purists say will be an invasion of rubbery
ravioli, squishy spaghetti and, heaven forbid, limp linguine.
   ``In the coming weeks, Italians will have to say goodbye to
their beloved firm pasta,'' said the newspaper La Repubblica.
   On Thursday, Italy lost its bid to maintain its so-called
``pasta purity'' law, a 1967 rule requiring all pasta sold in the
country to contain durum wheat, which is firmer and more expensive
than other varieties of wheat.
   The European Economic Community's Court of Justice ruled that
Italy could not use the law to block pasta imports from the other
11 Common Market nations, even though Italy still can compel its
own pasta makers to use durum wheat.
   ``That flavorful and firm macaroni, the product of our able
pasta makers, will be challenged, and maybe even replaced, by the
gluey and insipid pasta from Germany or Holland,'' La Repubblica
moaned.
   Italians have been eating pasta for at least 700 years and claim
it was brought to Italy by Marco Polo. It is always cooked ``al
dente,'' or firm.
   ``We have a profound respect for pasta,'' said Giuseppe Menconi,
director of the Italian Union of Pasta Makers.
   ``Go to Germany and eat their pasta,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``It practically melts on the plate. Our pasta is alive
on the plate.''
   Italian pasta makers insist the issue was not one of trade
barriers.
   ``This is a question of protecting the consumer,'' said Albino
Ganaspini, the spokesman for Barilla, the world's largest pasta
producer with an output of 450,000 tons a year.
   Italian firms produce about 1.8 million tons of pasta a year,
and the average Italian gulps down about 55 pounds of noodles
annually.
   Ganaspini said imported pasta could cost up to 30 percent less
than the kind made with durum wheat, but predicted few Italian
customers would lower their standards.
   The pasta case was brought to the Common Market's court by West
German pasta producer Drei Glocken after an Italian court sought to
block the company's export of pasta made with a wheat blend.
   The court's decision was based partly on a similar case in March
1987, when it ruled that West Germany's beer purity law violated
EEC free trade rules.
   The German rule had banned beers that did not contain the four
``pure'' ingredients: hops, yeast, malt and water.
   Despite the presence of the cheaper foreign beers, West Germans
have remained loyal to their pure domestic brews. Will Italians
stick to their pure pasta or go for the new wave of noodle?
   ``Sure I'd buy it, because it's cheaper,'' said Orsolina
Petrini, a Roman seamstress.
   But Claudio Cecarelli, owner of a pasta shop in central Rome
founded by his grandmother, said Italians will not mind paying more
for the purer pasta.
   ``When we eat pasta it is with a certain amount of
religiosity,'' he said.

   Rock star Michael Jackson launched his first
British tour with a spectacular two-hour concert during which he
rode over the heads of 72,000 screaming fans in a cradle suspended
from a crane.
   ``Shall I come down there?'' he teased as he dangled within
inches of their outstretched arms at London's Wembley Stadium on
Thursday night.
   But he didn't, confining himself instead to blowing kisses at
the fans and telling them, ``I love you.''
   During the performance, the 29-year-old star repeatedly
disappeared in puffs of smoke and behind silver curtains, only to
reappear seconds later hundreds of feet away.
   Among entertainers in the audience were British pop stars Boy
George and Terence Trent D'Arby and singer Diana Ross.
   The concert was the first of 13 Jackson is scheduled to give in

   The movie, inspired by Carlos Fuentes' book about the lives of
two North Americans who find themselves in Mexico in 1913 during
the Mexican Revolution, is directed by Luis Puenzo, who also
directed the Oscar-winning Argentine film ``The Official Story.''
   Fonda said the film, due to be released in the spring next year,

<HEAD>Mystery Woman Getting Facelift After 1,700 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ZIPPORI, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like Mona Lisa, the mystery woman has
dark hair, soft brown eyes with a come-hither look and full red
lips with a faintly amused expression. But after 1,700 years, she
is getting a facelift.
   ``The greatness of this woman is that she speaks to you from
beyond time,'' said Ehud Netzer of Hebrew University, co-director
of a project to move and preserve the woman's portrait in a 4th
century mosaic on the floor of a Roman villa.
   On Thursday, archaeologists began the arduous task of lifting
the 430-square-foot mosaic, rolling it up strip by strip and moving
it 125 miles south to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.
   The woman's beauty and ambiguous expression have prompted a
comparison a famous Leonardo da Vinci painting, the Mona Lisa,
which hangs in the Louvre Museum in Paris.
   ``It's the eyes. They follow you. There is nothing like her in
contemporary Roman art,'' said Eric M. Meyers, an archaeologist
from Duke University in Durham, N.C., who is directing the project
with his wife, Carol.
   The scholars still don't know whether the woman was a real
person or an artist's concept of ideal beauty. They say she could
be a famous actress from the nearby theater, a woman the artist
loved or a depiction of Aphrodite, the ancient goddess of love.
   ``Maybe she was supposed to be Aphrodite, but maybe she was a
real live person as well,'' said Meyers.
   One clue to the woman's identity may be in the building itself,
which Meyers speculates might have been an inn housing visiting
actors for the 3,000-seat theater next door.
   Brackets on the floor indicate three couches were placed around
the mosaic and that the room was used for dining, maybe even as an
after-theater restaurant.
   The border of the mosaic contains theater masks and the theme of
the panels is connected to the god Dionysis, who was associated
with the theater. So the mystery woman might have been an actress,
an Elizabeth Taylor of her day.
   ``The betting is 2-to-1 that she was a real person,'' said Laura
Zucker, 20, one of about 100 American students and volunteers
helping on the dig.
   The portrait and other panels of the mosaic are done in tiny,
naturally colored stones that Meyers said were laid down over a
watercolor blueprint painted by the artist.
   The state of preservation as well as the subtle artistry are
remarkable. For example, there was still a blush of color on the
cheeks when the portrait was daubed with a wet sponge.
   The task of giving the mosaic a facelift has fallen to Dodo
Shenhav, an Israel Museum expert who compares raising the
18-by-24-foot mosaic to surgery.
   Shenhav, whose past challenges have included removing the Dead
Sea Scrolls from sealed ceramic jars, said the operation will
involve fixing a water soluble glue to the mosaic and covering it
with burlap and additional glue.
   Once the seal is fixed, workers chisel under the stone carpet
and roll it up in a half-dozen strips.
   The pace is expected to be slow, and Shenhav said it could take
two to three weeks.
   Sepphoris, site of the modern-day cooperative farm of Zippori,
was the capital of the Galilee province of Roman Palestine.
   It was a cosmopolitan city, one of the few places where Jews,
pagans and Christians lived in harmony. The mosaic is contemporary
with Rabbi Yehuda Hanassi, who codified the Jewish law of the
Mishna in the city about A.D. 220.
   The city, only four miles from Nazareth, is also sacred to
Christians as the birthplace of the Virgin Mary.
   The city, which had a population of 20,000 in Roman times, was
devastated by an earthquake in 363. The tremors brought down the
villa in which the mosaic was located and the rubble helped
preserve the mosaic.

   Eight years after Jimmy Carter left the White
House in defeat and despair, his long political exile is coming to
an end here in his native Georgia.
   No longer is he shunned by the Democratic establishment or
scorned as the hapless leader who turned over the keys of the White
House to Republican Ronald Reagan.
   With the Democratic convention threatened by discord, Jesse
Jackson turned to Carter to mediate his high-profile differences
with Michael Dukakis. ``He has earned respect of all of us,''
Jackson explained.
   Jackson said he wants Carter to play ``a real role'' in settling
the differences. ``He understands the equation,'' Jackson said.
   Carter will deliver an opening-night speech before the
Democratic convention on Monday. He is hosting receptions for the
media, former Cabinet members and other dignitaries.
   And, the Carter Presidential Center will be the site for many
convention-related activities, such as forums on domestic and
foreign policy issues.
   At long last, Carter is an undisputed elder statesman of the
party.
   Democratic chairman Paul Kirk said Americans have changed their
opinion about Carter after ``eight years of three-by-five cards and
hands-off government'' under Reagan.
   ``People understand the sincerity and the seriousness of purpose
and the enlightment of values and views that President Carter
brought to his administration,'' Kirk said.
   ``And I think he will be greeted and welcomed at the Democratic
convention as he should be _ just as a president whose roots were
planted and nurtured here in Georgia but who made a great
contribution to values around the globe,'' Kirk said.
   Those must be sweet words to Carter, particularly since they
come from a man who wanted to see Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., not
Carter, as the Democratic nominee for president in 1980.
   It hasn't been easy for Carter since Reagan turned him out of
office in 1980, humiliating him with a 44-state sweep. Even after
losing the White House, Carter remained a favorite target of Reagan
and Republicans, blamed for the sagging economy and ridiculed by
George Bush for talking about America's ``malaise.''
   For a long while, Carter was remembered as the president who
left American hostages in Iran, the leader who authorized a rescue
attempt that ended in failure in the desert. He presided over a
nation that waited in long lines for gasoline and had to pay
double-digit interest rates for loans.
   But Reagan has had his setbacks, too: 242 servicemen killed in
Lebanon, Americans held hostage in Lebanon, record budget deficits,
the Iran-Contra scandal and, most recently, the picture of an
American warship shooting down a civilian airliner over the Persian
Gulf, killing 290 people.
   Perhaps these events have softened the Republican-promoted image
of Carter as inept.
   On the campaign trail, Bush, certain to be the Republican
presidential nominee, is likely to pass over Carter and talk about
``McGovern Democrats.''
   A relationship with Carter has proven not to be a political
liability, as evidenced by the election successes of former
administration members such as Carter's secretary of
transportation, Brock Adams, who won a Senate seat from Washington
state, and Andrew Young, former U.N. ambassador who now is mayor of
Atlanta.
   Though Carter's name is not frequently invoked by Michael
Dukakis, all of the Democrats who ran for president _ Dukakis
included _ made a pilgrimage to Georgia to pay respects this year.
   Carter's success is in marked contrast to that of another former
president, Richard Nixon. Fourteen years after Nixon resigned in
disgrace, he still avoids the Republican presidential conventions
and plays only a backstage role in offering occasional advice to
Reagan and Bush.

   Gov. Michael Dukakis' selection of Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen as his Democratic running mate has made the presidential
race a dead heat in Texas, according to the results of a recent
poll.
   CBS News reported Thursday night that a poll of 580 registered
voters in the Lone Star state on Tuesday and Wednesday found 48
percent supporting Dukakis to 44 percent for Bush. The margin of
error was plus or minus four percentage points, pulling Dukakis
even with Bush.
   Polls taken before Dukakis named Bentsen on Tuesday showed Bush
with a big lead in Texas but indicated the lead would narrow if
Bentsen were chosen,
   and the CBS poll confirmed that outcome.
   The survey also found that 57 percent of the respondents don't
think of Bush, who maintains an apartment in Houston, as a ``real

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. says he's raised
enough money to pay off the $2.1 million debt accumulated when he
ran for president during the Democratic primary and caucus season.
   ``This has been not only accomplished in record time but it has
been accomplished without asking any business person who provided
services to the campaign to take any discount,'' Gore told a news
conference on Thursday.
   Gore said a 10-week fund-raising effort among supporters across
the nation, plus federal matching funds will make it possible for
him to retire his campaign debts.
   Federal matching funds probably accounted for 35 or 40 percent
of the money raised while political action committees for special
interests provided another 5 percent Gore said in his announcement
at a fund-raising reception hosted for him by Gov. Ned McWherter,
chairman of his Super Tuesday campaign in the South.

   Although Jesse Jackson's campaign officials
have halted platform negotiations with officials from Michael
Dukakis' campaign, the platform chief for Dukakis says talks are
continuing.
   Former Maryland congressman Mike Barnes emphasized however, that
the two camps were just ``talking,'' not negotiating, over disputed

   ``We're continue to talk. I've talked to Eleanor (Holmes Norton)

   Norton, a Georgetown University law professor and Jesse
Jackson's chief platform negotiator, was unavailable for comment.
   The Jackson campaign halted the platform negotiations Wednesday
in response to the way Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis
handled the selection of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate.
   The Jackson forces reserved the right to take 13 issues still in
contention to the floor at the Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta on Tuesday, its second day when delegates will take up the
platform.

   One man who had been considered a possible
running mate for Michael Dukakis says the Democratic front-runner
made a mistake in not notifying Jesse Jackson about the vice
presidential choice before Jackson learned the news from a reporter.
   ``I'd say it was a mistake,'' said New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley,
who added, Dukakis ``should have informed Jackson first'' about his
selection of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen for the Democratic ticket's
No. 2 spot.
   Jackson was told of the choice by reporters as he arrived at
National Airport here on Tuesday morning. He later received a call
from Dukakis before the public announcement was made that afternoon.
   Bradley, who has become a favored Dukakis adviser, also
predicted the party's convention next week in Atlanta will end in
unity despite threats by Jackson supporters to oppose Bentsen.
   Relying on what he called a ``hunch,'' he said, ``When the
convention is over, I think Jesse Jackson will be looked at as
someone who played a role of unity.''

   Bert Lance, who has advised Jesse Jackson during
the presidential campaign, says he doesn't believe Jackson ever
thought he would be selected as the vice presidential nominee by
Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   ``I really don't think that from my own knowledge of Jesse
Jackson that he necessarily thought that he was ever going to be
the choice of Dukakis as related to the vice presidential
nomination,'' Lance said. ``I don't think that he ever thought that
was going to happen.''
   Lance's comments came in an interview with John McLaughlin for
his syndicated television show ``One on One,'' to be aired Sunday.
   The former budget director in the Carter administration, said
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen would not be considered too conservative
by Jackson supporters, and he predicted Jackson and his
constituency would back the Democratic ticket.

<HEAD>Sandinista Crackdown Spurs Dissidents, Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leftist Sandinista government's
violent crackdown on its critics has backfired and given new
momentum to opponents, dissidents say.
   ``These actions are going to strengthen the attitude of the
common people who don't want this regime,'' said Virgilio Godoy, a
former Sandinista labor minister and the president of the
Independent Liberal Party. ``This is the start of the opposition
moving from words to actions.''
   Meanwhile, President Daniel Ortega said that any U.S. decision
to resume arms shipments to the Contra rebels would revive a war in
which a truce was declared months ago.
   ``We hope they (the United States) do not commit this madness,
since it would be newly legitimizing'' the civil war, Ortega said
Thursday on state-run Voice of Nicaragua radio.
   During the crackdown this week, the government broke up a
demonstration, closed independent news outlets and expelled the
U.S. ambassador. The fallout continued Thursday, when the U.S.
House voted 385-18 to condemn Ortega's government for ``brutal
suppression of basic human rights.''
   A similar resolution was passed Wednesday by the Senate. That
measure included the possibility of military aid to the Contras if
present Sandinista policy does not become more democratic.
   ``It's tremendously interventionist and illegal,'' Deputy
Foreign Minister Hugh Tinoco said of the Senate resolution. ``We
call this imperialism.''
   Tinoco defended the crackdown as a response to growing threats
from the Contras and from attempts to destabilize the government.
   ``We can't take this with our arms folded,'' he said in an
interview with The Associated Press. ``What country in the world
wouldn't take measures?''
   On Sunday, government troops used tear gas and truncheons to
crush a demonstration by 100,000 people in Nandaime, south of
Managua.
   The government said 31 demontrators were sentenced to six-month
jail terms on Thursday for violating public security laws. Five
others received the same sentences on Wednesday.
   On Monday, the Sandinistas expelled U.S. Ambassador Richard
Melton and seven diplomats, charging them with crimes against the
Nicaraguan people and saying they authored a destabilization plan
that included the Sunday march.
   At the same time, the government closed the Roman Catholic radio
station and suspended for 15 days the only opposition newspaper, La
Prensa.
   ``The free press was used as part of the destabilization plan,''
Tinoco said.
   La Prensa repeatedly attacked the government. The newspaper had
backed the Sandinistas when they came to power in a 1979
revolutionary war that deposed the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza.
   The Sandinistas and the Contras negotiated a truce in March and
agreed to discuss a permanent end to their 7-year-old civil war.
But a series of high-level talks collapsed without agreement on
June 9.
   In recent weeks there has been a sharp increase in the number of
Contra attacks reported by the Defense Ministry. At least eight
civilians and several dozen soldiers have been killed in ambushes.
   A source in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic said
Thursday that Contra leaders planned to meet there this weekend to
reorganize the rebel organization and select new leadership. The
source spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The rebel group has been plagued by internal disputes between
moderates and hardliners and a lack of cash since U.S. aid was cut
off earlier this year.
   Opposition political groups inside the country, however, said
the government crackdown has fueled the anti-Sandinista movement.
   Enrique Bolanos, head of the Superior Private Enterprise
Council, said the Sandinistas reacted harshly because ``they cannot
stand the tremendous opposition that is gaining momentum.''
   The often fragmented political opposition showed more unity on
Sunday than ever before in striking out against the battered
economy.

   The dollar opened at 133.37 yen, up 0.42 yen from Thursday's

<HEAD>Many Cancer Screening Practices Not Used Enough, Survey Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans have failed to use several effective
cancer screening techniques often enough, possibly because of a
lack of publicity and the reluctance of some doctors to recommend
them, researchers say.
   However, two well-known tests, Pap Smears and breast exams, are
widely used, the national Centers for Disease Control reported
Thursday in its preliminary findings in a 1987 National Health
Interview Survey on cancer control.
   The survey asked people about the six major tests recommended
for early detection of cancer in their age and sex groups. Results
point to work that needs to be done in spreading the word about
some recommended tests, the Atlanta-based agency said.
   ``Efforts to increase the (routine) use of these screening tests
must include educating the public,'' the CDC said. ``This practice
permits the early detection of disease when treatment is most
effective _ that is, before symptoms occur.''
   For instance, while 97 percent of those surveyed had heard of
Pap Smears, only 68 percent of survey respondents had heard of
proctoscopy, the CDC report said, citing results from 5,723
interviews over the survey's first three months.
   The six tests are annual Pap Smears for women 18 and up _ and
earlier if sexually active _ to check for cervical cancer; regular
breast exams and mammograms for women 40 and over for breast
cancer; and the three checks for colon or rectum cancer: periodic
digital rectal exams for people 40 and over, yearly blood-stool
exams for those 50 and over, and proctoscopic exams every three to
five years for those 50 and over.
   Only 3 percent of the women 18 and over had never heard of Pap
Smears and 8 percent of the women 40 and over had never heard of
breast exams.
   But findings were much lower for the other tests. Seventeen
percent of those who should have such tests had never heard of
mammography, 20 percent had never heard of digital rectal exams, 17
percent had never heard of blood-stool exams and 32 percent had
never heard of proctoscopic exams.
   Furthermore, for every test except Pap Smears and breast exams,
between 19 percent and 45 percent of those surveyed who had heard
of the test had never had one. In contrast, 94 percent of women who
had heard of Pap smears have had one, and 92 percent of women who
know about breast examination have had it.
   ``With the exception of the Pap Smear and physical breast
examination, cancer screening procedures are underutilized in the
United States,'' the CDC concluded.
   ``It might simply be a lack of publicity,'' said Dr. Grey
Thompson, a fellow in cancer prevention and control at the National
Cancer Institute in the Washington suburbs. ``Some research
indicates that some physicians aren't recommending them.''
   That, she said, could be due in part to early concerns about the
radiation involved in mammograms. Newer-model machines emit much
less radiation, ``so now that fear can be pretty much put away,''
she said.
   Also, she noted that Pap Smears and physical breast exam
techniques have been in use longer than some of the other tests.
   The survey results also found discrepancies between blacks and
whites in knowledge of the tests. For instance, while 15 percent of
white women over 40 had never heard of mammography, 30 percent of
black women over 40 never had. While 29 percent of white
respondents over 40 had never heard of proctoscopy, the figure for
blacks was 55 percent.
   Researchers ``definitely'' believe the racial differences are
tied to education levels and socioeconomic status, Ms. Thompson
said.
   The findings were for January-March 1987. At the end of this
year, researchers hope to release the results from the complete
12-month survey.

<HEAD>Government Bans Mandela Birthday Concert</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government banned a
birthday concert for Nelson Mandela because it is terrified of any
event that honors the jailed black leader, anti-apartheid activists
said.
   Activists had hoped to the pop music show would be the highlight
of celebrations marking Mandela's 70th birthday.
   But Aubrey Mokoena, an activist who coordinated arrangements for
the ``Concert for Peace,'' said the Justice Ministry told
organizers Thursday that the show would be scrapped.
   The day-long concert was to feature some of South Africa's top
black musicians and take place near the black township of Soweto.
It was scheduled for Sunday, the day before Mandela's birthday.
   Mandela is probably the most popular leader among South Africa's
disenfranchised black majority. Mokoena said the government
declined to give reasons for the ban.
   ``The only possible conclusion is that the South African
government is terrified of the concept of the Mandela
celebration,'' Mokoena said.
   The organizers had anticipated a crowd of 25,000 people at the
concert and planned to donate the proceeds to charities. They had
arranged to hire a private security firm to ensure that no
disturbances occurred.
   Police last week arrested several people organizing a separate
Mandela birthday celebration in Cape Town. Activists fear that
event will also be banned, but the government has made no
announcement.
   Activists said at a news conference after the arrests that they
were determined to find a way to honor Mandela.
   ``In spite of all the intimidation, in spite of the obvious fear
of the government, our decision is clear: we will celebrate,'' said
the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed
Churches.
   ``If we cannot come together in our streets and halls,'' he
said, ``we will celebrate in our homes and churches, but we will
make sure Mandela's birthday does not go by unnoticed.''
   Police refused comment on a South African Council of Churches
report that officers raided offices of Cape Town anti-apartheid
organizations Wednesday, confiscating posters advertising Mandela's
birthday.
   ``The police were looking for documents and posters they could
submit to a magistrate as part of their argument for having the
Mandela birthday celebrations banned,'' the church council said.
``We fail to conceptualize how the celebration of Mr. Mandela's
birthday with song and dance can constitute a threat.''
   Mandela has been jailed since 1962 and received a life sentence
in 1964 after being convicted of plotting a sabotage campaign to
overthrow white-minority rule. When arrested, he was leader of the
guerrilla wing of the outlawed African National Congress.
   Surveys indicate Mandela probably would be elected president if
blacks could vote in national elections.
   His release from Cape Town's Pollsmoor Prison has been sought in
a prolonged international campaign.
   But the government has said it will not free him until he
publicly renounces violence. He has rejected the condition unless
the government lifts its ban on the guerrilla group and dismantles
apartheid.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   A woman who gave birth in an
airliner restroom, then left her newborn daughter stuffed beneath a
sink is ``very remorseful'' and wants the child back, the woman's
lawyer said.
   Christina Marie Locasto, 24, surrendered to authorities early
Thursday and pleaded innocent to felony child endangerment charges.
She left the San Mateo County jail arm-in-arm with her husband
after posting bail of $50,000.
   Locasto, a New York City resident and the mother of two
toddlers, faces up to six years in prison if convicted.
   The blue-eyed, brown-haired baby was in good condition at Mills
Memorial Hospital in San Mateo, which has received hundreds of
calls from people offering to adopt the 8-pound, 9-ounce infant,
spokeswoman Traci Ward said.
   San Mateo County officials took temporary custody of the child,
dubbed Elizabeth by a hospital nurse, after the infant was found
swathed in bloody towels, crying beneath a sink on the United
Airlines DC-10 on Wednesday.
   The jetliner had just completed Flight 35 from Newark, N.J., to
San Francisco. The child was believed to have been under the sink
for six hours.
   Louis Locasto, 26, was unaware his wife was pregnant or had
given birth aboard the plane, investigators said.
   Flight attendants told investigators that as the jetliner crew
was preparing for takeoff from Newark, a female passenger asked to
use the bathroom. The flight was delayed for a half-hour as flight
attendants knocked on the restroom door, urging the woman to come
out so the trip could begin.
   The woman finally emerged and joined her husband and their two
children, investigators said. Flight attendants found the bathroom
splattered with blood, but sealed it off in the belief the woman
had an extreme case of diarrhea. It remained locked until after the
plane landed.
   About 20 minutes after the plane landed Wednesday morning at San
Francisco International Airport, a cleaning crew found the infant
crying amid a pile of blood-soaked towels under the sink. The
Locastos left the airplane with other passengers.
   After the flight, blood was found on one of the Locastos'
airplane seats.
   Using a passenger list, sheriff's detectives contacted the
Locastos' relatives on the East Coast, and they in turn called
relatives the couple were visiting in Los Altos, 25 miles south of
San Francisco.
   Locasto surrendered Thursday after her husband called sheriff's
detectives.
   None of the relatives were aware the woman was pregnant, said
sheriff's Lt. Mike Dow.
   ``I am confident she did not plan to have the child on the
plane,'' her attorney, John L. Williams, said after she appeared in
court in an orange jail jumpsuit.
   Williams described his client as ``very remorseful, very
distraught,'' adding she told him she wants to keep the baby. He
refused to discuss the case further or reveal details of Locasto's
background.
   Assistant District Attorney Stephen Wagstaffe said he did not
know why she left the child on the airplane, and would not say
whether Locasto has a criminal record or a history of mental or
other problems.
   A court hearing Monday will determine whether county officials
should be given permanment custody of the infant. Elizabeth was
placed in the custody of the Children's Protective Services section
of the county Department of Social Services after being found.
   Little else was known about the Locastos, who were described by
their New York neighbors as a reclusive family.
   The San Francisco Examiner reported that the couple married in
April 1986, and moved to a quiet Staten Island neighborhood two
years ago. The woman's husband reportedly operates a limousine
business.
   ``They're regarded as loners,'' an unidentified neighbor told
the newspaper ``Particularly, her. She would say hello one day and
walk right by you the next.''

   Robert X. Williams Jr., the only
obstetrician-gynecologist in two poor counties with high infant
mortality rates, just ``worked himself to death,'' one of his
nurses said after he died while performing surgery.
   His son, Robert X. Williams III, a third-year medical student,
watched helplessly as Williams suffered a massive heart attack
Wednesday at Bullock County Hospital.
   ``He never turned patients down _ no matter what their financial
status,'' Williams said, recalling times when his father received
$5 a month from a patient trying to pay off a medical bill.
   The elder Williams, 54, had been delivering 60 to 80 babies a
month in Bullock and Macon counties, which have some of the
nation's highest infant mortality rates, according to the state
Department of Public Health.
   ``I think there were times when, for a period of several weeks,
he was on call constantly,'' said hospital administrator Duane
Brookhart, adding that he was amazed at Williams' heavy workload.
   ``I asked him how he was able to keep such a schedule. He would
shrug and say, `You get used to it.'''
   Because of Williams' death, obstetrics patients will have to be
referred to Montgomery hospitals 40 miles away, Brookhart said.
Finding a replacement to serve the two counties will be difficult.
   ``It's a very medically needy and also a medically risky and
underinsured population,'' he said, adding that most obstetricians
prefer to share their practices and workloads with a partner.
   ``We're a small, rural community. I don't think we can support
two obstetricians. And I don't think we're going to find another
obstetrician who is willing to work this whole area by himself.''
   Dr. Henry Johnson, a Montgomery obstetrician who studied under
Williams, said he influenced many young black doctors.
   ``He took care of essentially anyone who came to see him,''
Johnson said. ``I can't remember too many times when he left the
area for a vacation or whatever. He was pretty much on call 24
hours a day.''
   Williams had nearly completed a hysterectomy when he died. St.
Margaret's Hospital in Montgomery used its emergency helicopter to
fly Dr. Judi Jehle to Union Springs to complete the surgery, which
was done without complications, hospital spokeswoman Cathy Ellis
said Thursday.
   ``The patient was given a spinal (anesthesia) and she was awake
during the entire thing,'' Ms. Jehle said. ``When I got there ...
she seemed pretty calm, but she watched the whole thing.''
   Williams had delivered several babies Tuesday, ``and I could
tell from his on-call room he had been at the hospital all night,''
Ms. Jehle said. ``When I left, one of the nurses shook her head and
said, `He worked himself to death.'''
   Williams had planned to leave on a cruise this weekend to
celebrate his 32nd anniversary, Ms. Jehle said.
   His son stood by in the operating room as medical personnel
tried to save his father's life.
   ``That was one of the worst feelings I have ever had in my
life,'' the younger Williams said Thursday. ``I felt helpless.
   ``He was a good person at heart, and he was the best teacher and
mentor I had in my life,'' Williams said.
   He said he hopes to return to Macon or Bullock counties as a
doctor after he completes his medical training.
   ``There's no one to take his place down here,'' he said.

<HEAD>Sugar Making Comeback Relative To Other Sweeteners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar is making a comeback among American
consumers after years of trailing other sweeteners and might be
about ready to hold its own, says an Agriculture Department analyst.
   Robert Barry of the department's Economic Research Service said
that in 1987 Americans used more sugar, instead of less, for the
first time in 12 years. Per capita consumption rose 3 pecent to an
average of 62.2 pounds for the year.
   The deliveries of refined sugar to the food and beverage
industries, and wholesale and retail markets, rose 5 percent from
1986 to more than 7.6 million tons.
   Despite the increase, sugar still made up only about 40 percent
of the 152.4 pounds average 1987 per capita consumption of all
sweeteners, including those with calories and those without.
   Barry said in the July issue of Farmline magazine that growth in
the U.S. population and higher incomes have contributed to greater
sugar use. But there are other reasons, and one of the most
important involves HFCS, or high fructose corn syrup.
   ``After more than a decade of seizing markets from sugar in such
diverse products as beverages, baked goods, jams and other
processed foods, the cheaper to produce HFCS has come close to
reaching its technical limit of substitutability,'' he said. ``This
has stanched the dramatic losses of sugar in the past 12 years.''
   Barry added: ``Of course, there is the possibility of a
technical breakthrough (such as) lower-cost forms of dry fructose
or low-calorie sweeteners.''
   The sugar industry had been threatened by rival sweeteners for
many years but suffered no major losses until about 1975 when HFCS
emerged. Sugar prices were high at the time, and HFCS was cheaper
to produce, an advantage it still holds.
   At the time, in 1975, the beverage industry was sugar's largest
single market, using 25 percent of the sugar available. By last
year beverages used only 3 percent, turning to HFCS and non-caloric
sweeteners for diet drinks. Sugar deliveries to the beverage
industry dropped to 212,000 tons in 1987 from 2 million in 1975.
   But in other industrial uses, sugar and HFCS are not always
interchangeable, Barry said. For example, sugar deliveries to
bakery and cereal manufacturers rose to 1.5 million tons last year
from 1.2 million in 1975.
   Candy makers increased sugar use last year by 9.1 percent from
1986. One reason is that HFCS, a liquid, is less adaptable in candy
manufacture.
   A big question for the future of HFCS involves federal sugar
policy. Barry said that much will depend on whether sugar will
continue to be supported by the government at current price levels,
which encourage the development of substitute sweeteners.
   The U.S. sugar policy also involves imports and measures used to
protect domestic producers from cheaper foreign sugar flooding the
market. Although there was some strengthening, in May the world
price of sugar was still only 9 cents per pound, or only half of
the U.S. support price.
   Bills are in Congress which would lower the support levels,
thereby reducing domestic output and boosting imports. That is the
approach favored by the Reagan administration.
   ``Another initiative by the administration seeks to liberalize
trade through multilateral trade negotiations of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),'' he said. ``The goal is to
eliminate trade-distorting subsidies and allow better market access
for sugar worldwide.''
   Barry said a freer world market could reduce sugar prices for
American consumers but would probably also reduce the size of the
U.S. sugar industry.

   Missouri and Ohio are the first states to be
officially designated by the Agriculture Department as a natural
disaster areas because of this year's drought, but others are in
line.
   The designation opens the way for farmers in the designated
areas to apply for Farmers Home Administration emergency loans. The
Missouri designation was announced Wednesday by Gov. John Ashcroft
and U.S. Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, who also announced the Ohio
designation.
   Oxley said 92 percent to 100 percent of Ohio's corn crop will be
lost because of the drought, according to federal estimates.
   According to FmHA officials, 514 counties in Missouri and at
least 13 other states have been logged for official designation. As
of Thursday, those included: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,
California, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, New York,
South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.
   Other states also have submitted requests, too, the agency said,
including one from Gov. George Sinner who asked that all of North
Dakota be designated. Those, however, had not yet been registered
by FmHA, a spokesman said.
   In his letter to Ashcroft, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng
said the Missouri request was based on drought damages ``Jan. 1,
1988, through June 24, 1988, and continuing.''

   James W. Glosser, head of the department's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service, said Thursday the rule-making procedure
is a result of a petition filed by humane welfare groups asking
that USDA substitute freeze branding or comparable substitute for
the hot-iron method.
   The branding is used to identify cattle and other animals
infected or exposed to brucellosis and tuberculosis.

   Richard J. Hemmelsbach is finding
that being adopted by a childless baron is a costly honor.
   The Ferrysburg businessman was one of 10,000 people who
responded to a search by a German baron looking for an heir. The
search was first publicized June 3 on the nationally syndicated
television show, ``A Current Affair.''
   Hemmelsbach, 57, met Baron Theordor von Liebieg last week at the
baron's 100-bedroom castle on the Mosel and Rhine rivers in West
Germany and was chosen heir. He will inherit the castle when the
76-year-old baron dies.
   But there's a catch.
   One of the stipulations was that Hemmelsbach help the baron pay
off a $600,000 mortgage on the castle.
   ``I already have been adopted, but now I have to go out and slay
the dragon,'' Hemmelsbach said.
   He said his adoptive father said he sold the castle several
years ago to a developer who began turning it into a hotel and
restaurant but ran into financial trouble. Now a bank wants to
repossess the castle, Hemmelsbach said.
   Hemmelsbach said the baron also wants his heir to help him raise
$1 million to turn the hotel into an international hotel.
   ``He just does not have the vim and vigor to go out and do these
things, so he said, `This is something my new heir can do, my new
son,''' Hemmelsbach said.
   ``One of the reasons he chose me is because I have an
entrepreneurial background.''
   Hemmelsbach owns two small businesses in the Ferrysburg area,
including a sales company that represents acrylics manufacturers.
He also owns a company that developed an electronic warning device
for the elderly, he said.
   While the television show reported the 1,428-year-old castle was
on 89,000 acres, blueprints show only 100 acres, Hemmelsbach said.

   Gov. Henry Bellmon says he has had a sense
of deja vu on more than one occasion during his second term as
governor, since his first term was more than 20 years ago.
   At a meeting with Democratic leaders this week, several people
said the Republican governor addressed Senate President Bob
Cullison as `Clem' _ Clem McSpadden, that is, who was the Senate
president pro tempore during Bellmon's first term in office.
   Bellmon said Thursday he did not remember the slip but ``it
could have happened. I talked a lot with Clem.''
   He said there was a similar situation recently when he was
talking to a woman who worked at the governor's mansion.
   ``I kept saying Polly, but it wasn't Polly. She worked there 20
years ago. I couldn't believe it.''

   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A social register that for 67 years has
helped the elite sort out who is who among South Florida's
prominent residents has fought off a nouveau rival, its attorneys
said.
   The Social Index-Directory last month filed suit against The
Palm Beach Social Index, claiming the publication incorporated May

   But a hearing scheduled for Thursday was canceled when The
Social Index agreed to change its name to the Palm Beach Society
Blue Book and print a retraction of a June 10 news release in which
it made several disputed statements about the Index-Directory.
   ``We're 100 percent vindicated and 100 percent victorious,''
said Andrew Rafkin, the Index-Directory's attorney. ``We got
everything we wanted, which is not usual.''
   Index-Directory publisher Susan Kennedy said she did not mind
competition but said she didn't want people to be confused between
the two publications. Haley Ennis, publisher of what is now the
Blue Book, said she and her colleagues had not meant to insult the
Index-Directory's new owners.
   Both registers plan to publish listings of socially connected
people in the Bahamas and South Florida before Christmas.

<HEAD>Opposition Presses Protests; Salinas Urges Unity, Change in Shaken
PRI</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition candidates began a nationwide
round of rallies to press their charges that the governing party
stole the presidential election.
   The victor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, said the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party must respond to calls for change
after its biggest losses ever in the July 6 balloting.
   An estimated 15,000 supporters of conservative National Action
Party candidate Manuel J. Clouthier withstood a downpour Thursday
in the western city of Guadalajara to hear him accuse the
government of manipulating the election.
   He said his appearance in Mexico's second largest city was the
first in a national tour to gather signatures in a referendum to
decide whether the party should seek to have the election annulled.
   Clouthier, who won in Guadalajara but finished third nationwide
in results announced Wednesday by the Federal Election Commission,
said he does not know who won. But he said neither Salinas nor
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate of the left, can claim a credible
victory.
   The commission, dominated by the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, said Salinas won with 50.36 percent of the vote.
Cardenas followed with 31.12 percent and Clouthier with 17.07
percent.
   Cardenas, candidate of the leftist National Democratic Front and
the Mexican Socialist Party, planned to begin a national tour next
week after a major rally in the huge Zocalo Plaza on Saturday.
   He said he would target regions where he considers ``fraud was
the most brutal and ran roughshod on our party members.'' The son
of one of Mexico's most popular presidents, Cardenas led a
dissident movement in the PRI before breaking away to become
candidate of several small parties.
   Commission figures showed he won in the Federal District, the
adjacent states of Mexico and Morelos, the central western state of
Michoacan and Baja California, the northern half of the peninsula.
   The loss was the biggest ever since the PRI was founded in 1929,
but it still retained control of both houses of Congress.
   Parties supporting Cardenas won four of the 64 Senate seats in
an unprecedented loss for the PRI. Both the left and the right made
inroads in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Congress.
   The absence of any official presidential returns for a week
after the balloting fed reports of fraud and rumors of feuding
between old-guard PRI leaders who wanted their traditional
overwhelming victories and supporters of Salinas, who said he
wanted a clean election.
   Salinas, receiving congratulatory visits from party-affiliated
organizations Thursday, said he had been given ``a clear mandate
for change'' and called for unity among all parties and factions.
   ``The PRI today has the capacity and flexibility to face
successfully the call for change,'' he told state governors and the
party's executive committee. ``May no one try to convert political
plurality into national division.''
   Lorenzo Meyer, academic coordinator at the prestigious Colegio
de Mexico, said that since Mexican independence, elections have
been used to transfer power within a group or party rather than to
decide which would govern or who the leaders would be.
   ``It is because of this tremendous weight of anti-democratic
history that what is happening today is important and it is for
that same reason that the change in electoral custom _ from
non-competitive elections to true elections _ finds so many
obstacles,'' he wrote in the newspaper Excelsior this week.
   Change, he said, is only beginning.
   ``It's obvious that the birth of modern Mexico is turning out to
be a difficult and prolonged delivery and that it's still not known
if it will reach a happy ending,'' he said.
   Some of the PRI's losing candidates said the party must reform
to survive.
   ``With the triumphs obtained by the opposition a profound
restructuring ... of the party to recover the ground lost in the
past elections becomes indispensable,'' Cuauhtemoc Sanchez Barrales
told the newspaper El Sol de Toluca, 40 miles west of Mexico City
in the state of Mexico.
   He lost a congressional election in the Toluca-Metepec district
to a candidate from Cardenas' coalition.
   Julio Millan, an economic consultant who lost a congressional
race to National Action in the capital, said the party ``now has to
demand from officials greater efficiency and dedication, a pure
honesty and an attitude of service that the population is
demanding.''

   Government agents arrested a British

proper business license, immigration officials said today.
   Ponciano Ortiz, an intelligence officer at the Commission on
Immigration and Deportation, said Vincent Charles Browne ``will
definitely be deported,'' but did not specify any date.
   Ortiz said in a telephone interview that Browne was arrested
Thursday in an office at the Manila suburb of Makati where he
allegedly recruited Filipino women as prospective brides for
clients in Britain.
   A report in the Philippine Daily Globe quoted Browne as saying
he was not aware that he had violated any laws since his office was
an ``ordinary introduction agency.''
   No formal charges have been filed against Browne, who was being
held in a detention center for foreigners awaiting deportation.

   China has sent a delegation to the United States
to monitor the American presidential election and study democracy
in action, an official newspaper said today.
   The 10-member group, which left Wednesday, will attend the
conventions of the Democratic and Republican parties and interview
presidential candidates and other important politicians, the Legal
Daily reported.
   The daily said Chinese delegates planned to meet with American
politicans to discuss U.S.-Chinese relations, China's economic and
political development and international affairs.
   The delegation is made up of members of the Chinese People's
Institute of Foreign Affairs, a scholarly group; and the Law
Association of the National People's Congress, China's legislature.
   The newspaper said the delegation was invited to the United
States by the Washington-based Center for Democracy, which includes
members of both American political parties. It advocates democratic
change throughout the world.
   Under the liberalization program begun by senior leader Deng
Xiaoping, China has begun to reform its political system to include
elements of democracy.
   Some elections have been held in cities and counties for
government posts, although most of the candidates have been picked
by the Communist Party.
   Despite the changes, the party remains the dominant force in
Chinese political life, and no serious calls for a multiparty
system have been considered by the authorities in Beijing.

<HEAD>Panel To Restudy Issue of Federal Funds for Test Tube Baby
Research</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Reagan administration official says the
government is going to take another look at whether it should
finance research into test tube fertilization to produce babies.
   Dr. Robert E. Windom, the Health and Human Services Department's
assistant secretary for health, acknowledged under questioning
before a House subcommittee Thursday that a new ethics advisory
board is being formed but said the new panel might not be completed
in time for action before the Reagan administration leaves office
in January.
   Windom told the human resources subcommittee of the House
Committee on Government Operations that the decision to form a
panel to restudy the question on whether to lift a de facto ban on
federally financed research is in response to a recommendation from
Dr. James B. Wyngaarden, director of the National Institutes of
Health. Wyngaarden has recommended the government approve a grant
from Washington University in St. Louis to conduct in vitro
fertilization research.
   Although some 200 private clinics offer such services and some
5,000 babies have been born as a result, the matter of federal
involvement has been an unresolved issue dating back to the Carter
administration.

   The National Weather Service says it is
shifting eastward its focus on the drought plaguing much of the
nation, but the agency says there's still little relief in sight
for most areas.
   The agency's new short-range forecast on Thursday predicted hot,
dry weather to expand eastward from the Rockies through the Ohio
Valley to the Mid-Atlantic states through next Monday.
   Rapidly moving weather systems are expected to drag weak fronts
along the U.S.-Canadian border, possibly triggering scattered
showers in the extreme northern Plains and upper Mississippi
Valley. The heavy rain which has hit portions of Texas is expected
to diminish.
   Long-term drought conditions now cover a large area of the Great
Lakes region and the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the agency's
Climate Analysis Center reported.
   In addition, drought conditions persist over large areas of the
northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountains.

   President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari
says he has a mandate to modernize the nation's political and
economic systems because he is the youngest elected chief executive
in more than 50 years.
   Salinas de Gortari, 40 was declared the winner in the July 6
election as the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party,
or PRI, which has governed Mexico since 1929. He takes office in
December.
   The youngest chief executive this century was Lazaro Cardenas,
one of Mexico's most revered presidents, who was 39 when he took
office in 1934. Today, half of Mexico's population is 16 or younger.
   Cardenas' son, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, was one of two opposition
candidates who gave Salinas a tough race that resulted in the
slimmest victory margin for the PRI in its history. Also running
was Manuel J. Clouthier of the conservative National Action Party.
   Critics of the PRI contended the party won the election through
fraud.
   Salinas insists that he does not mind the lower margin of
victory, that it represents a first step in modernization as a
recognition of opposition forces and recent changes in Mexico.
   In claiming victory the day after the polls closed, Salinas said
the end of the era of virtually exclusive power for the PRI must be
recognized.
   ``It is the new political reality of the nation, and with which
we will have to coexist in a harmonious and respectful fashion,''
he said.
   Salinas spoke during the campaign of the need for ``democratic
reforms,'' clean elections and less state intervention in the
economy.
   He will have to prove to Mexicans weary of six years of economic
hardship that growth can start again, jobs can be generated and the
steady erosion of purchasing power halted.
   Salinas' main problem after his inauguration will be to foster
faith in his government so it can support any reforms he plans to
undertake.
   An increasingly greater number of Mexicans have become
disenchanted with and skeptical of the PRI and the country's
political institutions, as indicated by the high number of
abstenteeism at election time _ about half the registered voters,
according to government figures.
   Like his three precedessors, Salinas has had no experience in
elective office. He joined the PRI when he was 18 and rose through
the ranks of the government bureaucracy by dint of party loyalty to
become outgoing President Miguel de la Madrid's budget and planning
secretary.
   But unlike the other three, he comes from a family of seasoned
PRI politicians. His father, Raul Salinas Lozano, was commerce and
industry secretary in the 1958-64 administration of President
Adolfo Lopez Mateos and is currently a PRI senator for the family's
home state of Nuevo Leon bordering the United States.
   An uncle, Elias de Gortari, is a university professor and PRI
ideologue. His mother, Margarita de Gortari Carvajal, an economist
active in party politics, helped found and was the first president
of the Association of Women Economists.
   The Salinas' are an old Spanish family that first settled in the
small Nuevo Leon town of Agualeguas in the 18th century.
   The new president was born in Mexico City on April 3, 1948. He
and his wife, Cecilia Occelli Gonzalez, have three children.
   An economist, Salinas is among the best educated of Mexico's
presidents. He holds two master's degrees and a doctorate in public
administration, all from Harvard.
   He speaks and reads English and French in addition to his native
Spanish.
   Salinas also is an avid sportsman. As a member of Mexico's
equestrian team, he won a silver medal in riding at the 1971
PanAmerican Games.
   He often runs several miles a day, plays tennis and is a soccer
fan.
   Short, slim and balding with a full mustache, Salinas is always
smartly dressed and groomed. His closest associates say that behind
his genial demeanor is a sharp mind and forceful character.
   Political writer Adrian Lajous described him in a biographical
sketch as ``exceptionally intelligent and also very fast mentally.''

   President Reagan has given conflicting
indications on whether he will veto a Pentagon budget bill that
deeply cuts his request for Star Wars spending and restricts his
arms control policies, lawmakers say.
   ``I don't think we have a clear signal,'' Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan., said. ``I'm not certain the president will sign
this bill.''
   Dole spoke on Thursday shortly before the Senate voted 64-30 for
the measure, hours after the House approved it, 229-183. Both
Democratic-controlled chambers split along party lines as they sent
the bill to Reagan's desk.
   Dole and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, told their colleagues that Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci had indicated Reagan was likely to sign the bill.
   But Sen. Daniel Quayle, R-Ind., who made an unsuccessful attempt
to strip the provisions Reagan disliked, said the administration
opposed the measure.
   The bill permits $4 billion for the Strategic Defense
Initiative, as Reagan's 5-year-old Star Wars anti-missile program
is formally known. That is slightly above the current SDI budget of
$3.9 billion but far less than the $4.8 billion Reagan wanted.
   As part of the Star Wars budget, the bill deeply reduced
spending for the space-based interceptor, which is being developed
as the first phase of an eventual SDI program. The Pentagon wanted
$330 million for the program, but the bill restricts the total to
only $85 million.
   The final measure was worked out by a House-Senate conference
committee and is a compromise between bills passed separately by
each chamber.
   Shortly before the final vote, the Senate rejected, 58-35, an
effort by Quayle and other conservative Republicans to return the
bill to a conference committee and strip out the Star Wars
reductions and other arms control restrictions opposed by Reagan.
   The bill authorizes Pentagon spending of $299.5 billion for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The total is a slight reduction from
the $301 billion authorized this year and marks the fourth straight
year of either freezes or reductions in the defense budget,
following large increases during Reagan's first term.
   Highlights of the bill:
   ARMS CONTROL _ The measure requires withdrawal and retirement of
three aging missile-firing Poseidon submarines as new
missile-firing boats are introduced into the fleet. That continues
the policy of generally keeping the United States near weapons
limits imposed by the unratified SALT II nuclear treaty.
   The bill also directs the Energy Department to prepare for a
comprehensive treaty banning nuclear tests, a longtime goal of arms
control supporters.
   The measure bans flight testing of ``depressed trajectory
missiles'' as long as the Soviets refrain from testing their
versions of those weapons. Depressed trajectory weapons, which fly
relatively low, could be launched from submarines and could
theoretically be launched off each nation's shores with relatively
little warning time.
   MILITARY-DRUGS _ The bill includes $300 million to increase the
military's role in the anti-drug effort and orders the Pentagon to
provide more intelligence and tracking information to civilian law
enforcement agencies.
   PAY RAISES _ The nation's 2.1 million uniformed military
personnel will receive a 4.1 percent pay increase. Reagan had
sought a 4.3 percent increase.
   NUCLEAR WEAPONS _ The measure proposes $250 million each for the
single-warhead Midgetman and the railroad version of the MX, a pair
of land-based nuclear missiles. Reagan wanted only $200 million for
the Midgetman, which is strongly backed by Democrats, and $793
million for the MX. The bill also contains $250 million that the
secretary of defense in the new administration next year can spend
for either program.
   NAVY SHIPS _ The bill includes money for one more Trident
missile-firing submarine, a pair of Los Angeles-class attack subs,
the first of a new Seawolf class of attack subs, three destroyers,
two oilers and an amphibious assault ship.
   OTHER WEAPONS _ The measure provides money for 180 F-16 jet
fighters, 36 F-15 fighters, a dozen F-14 jets for the Navy, 84
FA-18 jets for Navy carriers, 24 AV-8 Harrier jets, four of the new
long-range C-17 cargo planes, 669 M-1 tanks, 581 Bradley Fighting
Vehicles for the Army, 1,310 Standard missiles and 72 Apache attack
helicopters for the Army, 72 Blackhawk helicopters for the Army,
1,310 Standard missiles, 261 of the top-line MK-48 torpedoes, 815
Patriot air defense missiles, and 48,000 rockets for the Army's
multiple-launch rocket system.

<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hearing-impaired boy whose origins
mystified authorities for months until he was recently reunited
with his family has been placed in a children's home in Mexico.
   Jose de Jesus Garcia Aguilera, 9, was moved to the home in
Ciudad Victoria operated by the Integrated Family Development
agency. He can receive special education for deaf children there,
an agency spokeswoman said Wednesday.
   The boy, known as Sabath, was found last November near downtown
Ciudad Juarez, across the Rio Grande from El Paso. Because he could
barely hear or speak and couldn't write, authorities could not
determine his identity. Finally, the freckle-faced boy's mother was
located in Tampico, a port on Mexico's Gulf Coast.
   The boy, nicknamed Chuy, is staying at a home about 200 miles
from Tampico.
   Social workers tried unsuccessfully to persuade Chuy's mother to
giveup her son for adoption, DIF spokeswoman Juana Barazas de
Galindo said.
   ``She said she couldn't take care of him,'' Ms. Barazas de
Galindo said. ``She didn't want to give him up for adoption because
she was afraid she wouldn't be able to see him. His grandmother
feared he would run away again.''
   The mother reluctantly accepted the agency's decision to move
him to the school, DIF officials said.
   The boy was called Sabath because he was found on a Saturday _
sabado in Spanish. His drawings of what looked like a plane crash
prompted speculation he had survived a crash that killed his
parents and sister. Authorities now believe the pictures might have
been an attempt to tell them Chuy lived near an airport in Tampico.
   His mother, who had been searching for her son for about nine
months and suspected Sabath was her missing child, answered an
advertisement placed by an El Paso Times reporter in a Mexican
newspaper.
   The two were reunited June 28 in Juarez.
   ``His mother will be able to see him every couple of weeks. It's
a long drive but it's possible,'' his uncle, Nicolas Aguilera
Paredes, told the Times in a phone interview.

   Neighbors said they feel certain that rival crack
dealers firebombed a duplex apartment in which four innocent people
died and six other people were injured.
   ``There's been threats to blow up the house. You sit on the
porch and you hear it every day: `I'm going to get my stuff and
I'll be back and I'll blow you up,''' neighbor Dorethea Harrison,
20, told The Detroit News.
   Harrison and her mother and another family were left homeless
Thursday morning when the fire spread to their adjacent duplex on
East Philadelphia, a narrow, tree-lined street on the city's north
side.
   Harrison and other residents said crack cocaine was sold and
used for years at the firebombed apartment.
   Fire Department Lt. Thomas O'Neill identified the dead as
Carroll Jones, 66; Michael Conerly, 32; George Hill, 47; and
Dorothy Jackson, 39.
   The four victims were alcoholics and had nothing to do with the
illegal drugs, Harrison said.
   ``They just drank,'' she said. ``They'd fuss about their wine
and where to get money for wine.'' The victims weren't related,
Harrison said.
   Six people in the two-story building were injured and were taken
to Detroit Receiving Hospital, said hospital spokesman Dennis
Archambault.
   A nursing supervisor who declined to give her name said this
morning that none of them was still there.
   Police and fire officials have disclosed few details of the fire.
   ``All the witnesses that were interviewed have indicated there
was a firebombing,'' said a police arson inspector who wouldn't
give his name. No arrests have been made, police spokesman Sgt.
George Anthony said today.
   ``They did their business right outside,'' Harrison said. ``From
what I'd heard, they'd been arguing earlier (Wednesday) about
money, and they said they'd be back later to settle it.''
   Harrison's mother, Dorethea Thompson, said authorities arrested
several alleged crack dealers and boarded up the duplex about four
months ago.
   ``We were really happy,'' Thompson said. ``Then, a month and a
half later, (crack dealing) started again.''
   Otto Cureton, who lived with his girlfriend and two daughters in
the same duplex as the Thompson family, said he was awakened before
dawn Thursday by the sound of breaking glass. He said he went
outside, saw the fire and also saw five men fleeing on foot.
   Crack was dealt from the duplex next door ``on and off for the
past four years,'' Cureton said. ``Different crews would come in
and deal.'' He agreed with Harrison that an argument among dealers
on Wednesday prompted threats of violence.
   Thompson and Cureton stood in front of their burned duplex and
watched arson investigators throw ashes and charred wood with
shovels out of a window of the unit where the four alcoholics'
bodies were found. Temporarily homeless, they expressed sharply
different feelings about relocating.
   Asked whether she might find a new home in a part of Detroit
untouched by crack, Thompson said: ``I doubt it. Crack is all over.
So I don't know.''

<HEAD>Vice President Of Southam Newspaper Group Dies At 80</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Watson Southam, a vice-president of the
Southam newspaper group for 27 years, has died at the age of 80.
   Southam died Wednesday of a heart attack after a game of tennis
in Toronto. Southam Inc. is Canada's largest communications and
information company and owns 15 daily newspapers.
   A third-generation member of the family dynasty, Southam was the
son of William James Southam, a former publisher of the Hamilton
Spectator.
   He began his career as a reporter for the Vancouver Province in
1930 and held various positions in the newsroom. By 1945, he was
production manager and moved to Southam's head office in Montreal
to become vice-president.
   Southam's son Peter, 54, said Thursday his father was most
interested in the production of the newspapers.
   ``He was mostly in the technical side,'' said Southam, manager
in the company's department of corporate and technical services at
the head office in Toronto.
   ``He had a deep interest in the presses, in the material things
and in the administrative side all along.''
   Southam retired in 1972. He travelled widely and played tennis
three days a week. He and his wife, Kitten, spent their winters in
Florida.

<HEAD>FAA Expert: Better Inspections Key To Avoiding Repeat Of Aloha
Accident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Proper aircraft inspection is the ``weak link''
in efforts to prevent accidents like the one that ripped the top
off an Aloha Airlines jetliner at 24,000 feet, a Federal Aviation
Administration expert says.
   A National Transportation Safety Board panel, which winds up
four days of testimony here today, is trying to determine the cause
of the April 28 accident and what it can teach about the problems
of operating aging airplanes.
   Tom Swift, an FAA national resource specialist on aircraft
structures from Long Beach, Calif., also told the hearing Thursday
that he believes the Boeing 737 broke open because a bonded
fuselage joint separated, leading to a rapid failure of the metal
along a line of rivets.
   ``It was the worst-case condition,'' Swift said.
   Another FAA witness told the inquiry board that tiny cracks were
found in nearly half the Boeing 737 jetliners known to have been
inspected under an FAA airworthiness directive issued after the
Aloha accident.
   An 18-foot section blew away from the top of the pressurized
Aloha jet over Hawaii, throwing a flight attendant to her death and
injuring 61 of the 94 people aboard. Passengers in the forward
cabin were exposed to the air while the pilot made an emergency
landing.
   Asked by inquiry chairman John K. Lauber what ``the bottom
line'' was for preventing another such accident, Swift replied it
rested with the airlines and their inspection programs for
corrosion and metal fatigue.
   ``I know where the weak link is, and it's in the inspection,''
Swift said.
   Such inspections are mind-numbing jobs, he said, adding that
research was needed to take the ``human element'' out of the
inspections.
   ``Hell, we put a man on the moon, why can't we develop an
inspection program that can guarantee we can find these cracks?''
he asked.
   The Aloha jet, built in 1969, had had 89,680 landings,
second-highest of any 737.
   Swift, one of the FAA officials who examined the jet, said he
believes adhesive gave way along a lap joint where parts of the
fuselage are bonded and riveted together, most likely because of
corrosion.
   Within a week of the Aloha accident, the FAA ordered all 737s
with 30,000 or more landings to undergo a special visual inspection
of fuselage lap joints, and 737s with more than 50,000 landings to
have additional inspections using high-frequency electronic
equipment.
   Airlines were required to fix any problems found and report test
results to the FAA.
   James W. Hart Jr., manager of the airframe branch in the FAA's
Seattle aircraft certification office, told the NTSB panel 291
planes were affected by the order. As of this week, he said, the
FAA has received reports on 100 planes, of which 49 had cracks.
Five or more cracks were found in 14 of those planes, he said.
   Bill Ashworth, manager of the FAA's Seattle aircraft
certification division, said he was concerned about the cracks but
saw no imminent danger to the planes or to air passengers.
   ``We of course are requiring that all cracks we find be
repaired. That's only prudent maintenance,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bishop Says Drug Traffickers Donate To Parish Priests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug traffickers in many Latin
American countries are donating money and offering drugs to parish
priests, and the Roman Catholic Church is not sure what to do about
it, a Venezuelan bishop said.
   Monsignor Baltazar Porras, assistant bishop of Merida, 350 miles
southwest of Caracas, said in a recent telephone interview that in
recent years more priests are being offered the gifts for personal
gain or for use in charities.
   But he said the church isn't sure the money should be turned
down because some of the traffickers consider the donations
retribution for their sins, Porras said.
   The growing problem was one of the key issues discussed by
Venezuelan bishops during their annual Episcopal Conference, which
ended Tuesday.
   ``Priests are being offered money and drugs, primarily at the
parish level. This has been going on for several years now in Latin
America,'' he said.
   ``Some see it is a way to launder money they don't know what
else to do with, but it is possible that the donation could be
licit if it is for use in charities, to forgive sins.''
   A Spanish-born priest from a poor parish near Caracas was
arrested last April carrying 46 pounds of cocaine as he waited in
Maiquetia International Airport outside Caracas for a flight to
Madrid.
   It was the first case in Venezuela of a church official being
arrested for involvement in the drug trade.
   The priest, who confessed he had made at least two previous
trips to Spain in which he carried and later sold drugs, said he
used the proceeds from the sales to pay for a new chapel,
improvements in the parish school and charity.
   ``There is no doubt that money is one of the biggest temptations
of this society (and) these are all charities that require money.
This is a human failing from which (priests) are not exempt,''
Porras said.
   ``To accept it for the church is not correct. Any church works
done using money derived from drugs cannot be consecrated,'' he
said. ``But I think it could be acceptable for charities.''
   The bishop said knowledge of the offers is transmitted to higher
church levels through confession, and that Pope John Paul II in
Rome has been informed of the matter through regular church
channels.
   The pope has not issued any specific instructions, the bishop
said.
   ``To know whether the intention (of the donor) is good or bad is
difficult,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the church cannnot cooperate fully with law
enforcement agencies because of the confidentiality of confession,
he said.
   Venezuela's Justice Minister Pedro Torres Agudo met with the
church officials during the five day episcopal conference, but no
formal agreement was reached between the church and the government,
he said.
   ``There is no type of institutional help because of the position
of the church on confidentiality,'' he said.
   Instead, he said, ``the church is doing what it can to insist
upon moral values and to help out needy families. This is the labor
we must do.''

<HEAD>Activists Head Into Mexico Wondering Why They Were Allowed To</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-eight peace activists headed
through Mexico on their way to Nicaragua still wondering why U.S.
officials suddenly stopped enforcing a trade embargo and let them
drive across the Rio Grande.
   ``It's had a lot of us shaking our heads,'' said Gerry Condon,
41, of Santa Cruz, Calif., a coordinator of the Veteran's Peace
Convoy.
   The group cleared Mexican customs stations Thursday night with
14 vehicles after the group paid about $650 for two escorts to
accompany them to the Guatemala border.
   ``It feels great,'' Condon said after the convoy was cleared by
Mexican officials to leave Nuevo Laredo. ``We've been ready to go
for a long time. We feel it's a big victory, even though we have
far fewer people and vehicles than when we came down last month.''
   The U.S. Treasury Department blocked the group's trucks from
leaving the United States at least three times, contending that
taking the vehicles to Nicaragua would violate a 3-year-old trade
embargo.
   The government agrees the food and medical supplies qualify as
humanitarian aid exempt from the Nicaraguan Trade Control
Regulations, but says the vehicles are not humanitarian aid. Convoy
members refused to sign forms promising to return the trucks.
   Eight ``convoyistas'' were arrested Saturday in a confrontation
with officials at the border and one of the eight was rearrested
early Monday when Customs again refused to let him cross.
   But later Monday, the group said it started crossing vehicles
and finally drove the last one across Wednesday.
   ``Maybe they had a policy of going ahead and letting us slip
across as long as we were quiet about it,'' Condon said. ``There
were times when people looked the other way and in fact in some
cases there was nobody looking.''
   U.S. Customs spokeswoman Donna De La Torre in Houston said the
policy toward the convoy had not changed.
   ``We do not routinely stop vehicles heading south,'' Ms. De La
Torre said. ``But if someone announces that they'll be violating
the law, we'll know about it and will be waiting for them,'' she
said.
   She said three of the convoy drivers were allowed to cross
because they told Customs they were going to Mexico.
   The convoy cleared one Mexican customs station Thursday, but at
a second, some firecrackers were confiscated by Mexican
authorities, who insisted the vehicles have escorts. Escorts are
required for people transporting imports through Mexico, customs
officials said.
   The convoy left a psychedelic-painted bus, named ``Peace
Train,'' in Nuevo Laredo, for a charity organization, because they
did not think it would make the trip.
   The convoy first tried to cross the border at Laredo in June
with 38 vehicles and 106 people, but were refused permission. They
returned to Laredo last week with fewer people and vehicles,
because some members of the group had to return to work.
   Thirteen vehicles will stay in Nicaragua, they said, and one
will return.

<TEXT>
   A former Navy analyst convicted of spying
for Israel has ended a four-day hunger strike at a federal prison
at the urging of his father.
   Jonathan Jay Pollard, 33, began eating Thursday, officials at
the U.S. Bureau of Prison's maximum security penitentiary said.
   ``We are very relieved,'' said Pollard's father Morris, a
biology professor at the University of Notre Dame. The elder
Pollard has kept in daily contact with his son since the hunger
strike began Sunday, and said he convinced Jonathan to end it.
   ``He proved his point and we didn't want this to continue too
long,'' Dr. Pollard said.
   Jonathan Pollard was transferred to Marion last month from a
federal medical facility for convicts at Springfield, Mo., his
father said. Since then, the elder Pollard said, his son's letters
have been diverted to Naval Intelligence in Washington for security
checks, but have never been forwarded to addressees.
   The prisoner began a hunger strike because he believed his
letters weren't being delivered, and because he thought attorneys
were being barred from visiting him, his father said. Pollard also
complained that his ailing wife Anne, also convicted and
imprisoned, was not receiving proper medical care.
   Randy Davis, executive assistant to the warden at Marion, said
Pollard was not visited by an attorney because the court has not
appointed one yet. Naval officials were not available Thursday
night to comment on the allegations concerning his letters.
   Pollard began refusing food Friday morning but ate later in the
day, Davis said. He ate breakfast and lunch Saturday, but refused
to eat dinner, and skipped all meals from Sunday until Thursday,
when he ate breakfast and lunch, the prison said.
   ``He's fine,'' Davis said. ``He wasn't on it (the hunger strike)
long enough to hurt himself.''
   ``I would imagine he thought he got his point across,'' Davis
added.
   Pollard was sentenced last year to life in prison without
parole. He was charged with passing classified information to
Israeli agents in 1985.

<HEAD>South Korea Calls For Student Exchange Visit With North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea today urged communist
North Korea to let students from both sides march across the
divided peninsula in a pilgrimage to ease tension, but the north
refused to accept the proposal.
   The south's education minister, Kim Young-shik, proposed that
about 1,000 students from each side should march north or south
across the 600-mile peninsula to build mutual trust and help open
the way for normal relations.
   ``It would help restore a sense of national trust and identity
among the young generation and provide a foothold for multilateral
nation exchanges,'' Kim said in a nationally broadcast speech.
   But North Korea notified the south Thursday night that it would
not accept a letter outlining the proposal. A North Korean
statement monitored in Tokyo said the plan would only be considered
if Seoul apologized for refusing to accept its last three official
messages.
   Radical student groups in the south, who have been pressing for
reunification, criticized the government proposal as a sham.
Student leaders, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was a
bid to divert attention from unpopular government policies.
   On June 10, the government used riot police to stop thousands of
students marching to the border for talks with North Korean student
delegates.
   On July 10, South Korean President Roh Tae-woo unveiled a plan
to end the confrontation between the pro-Western south and the
communist north by broad political, trade, cultural and
humanitarian exchanges. Roh said the plan could lead to eventual
peaceful reunification.
   But North Korea rejected the Roh proposal as pointless. ``This
is nothing new and not worth examination,'' North Korea said in a
July 11 statement.
   The two Koreas have no relations and the border is sealed. They
technically are still at war since no peace treaty was signed at
the end of the Korean War in 1953.
   Both governments say they want reunfication, but on their terms.
Each side insists it is the only legitimate Korean government and
most observers doubt there will be any dramatic change in relations.
   The education minister proposed the two sides hold talks by the
end of July on a plan to allow about 1,000 students from each
nation to march sometime this year. Roh had said in June that he
would call for student exchange visits with the north.
   North Korea has said there is no need for government involvement
and student exchanges and meetings should be independent. Its
position is designed to support radicals in the south, even though
any North Korean student delegation would be under strict communist
party control.
   South Korean students would march from the border across North
Korea to Mount Paektu on the Chinese border, while North Korean
students would march across the south to Mount Halla on the
southern island of Cheju.
   The march could clear the way for sports events between colleges
in the north and south involving about 200 students, Kim said. The
first sports event would be in Pyongyang in October, followed by a
second sports meet in Seoul next April, he said.
   If the first exchanges are a success, Kim said they could be
expanded to cultural and artistic exchanges and tours by students
from both nations.
   Roh's proposals were similar or identical to past iniatives by
both governments since 1971 on improving relations all failed to
produce results. The two Koreas arranged small-scale family
reunification visits and cultural exchanges in 1985.
   North Korea, which has staged a number of attacks on the south
over the years, is demanding to co-host the Olympic Games in Seoul
this September. Olympic authorities have rejected the demand and
the north has said it will boycott the Olympics.
   The Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by U.S. and Soviet
forces that ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War
II. The north invaded the south in 1950 to trigger the three-year
Korean War.

   The first person to undergo a liver-pancreas
transplant in the United States is making steady progress and
appears to have been cured of his insulin-dependent diabetes, his
doctors say.
   ``He can go to the ice cream parlor now and nothing will happen
to him,'' said Dr. Andreas Tzakis, one of about 10 surgeons who
took part in the landmark operation.
   The 39-year-old New York City man, whose identity was withheld
at his request, received the organs during 16 hours of surgery July
1 at Presbyterian-University Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   In addition to being diabetic since 1969, the man had hepatitis,
an inflammation of the liver, which he got from blood transfusions
during a 1964 heart operation. The diabetes, unrelated to the
hepatitis, struck him when he was 20.
   The man eventually would have died from his condition.
   ``Both he and his wife ... are a very strong couple.
Psychologically, he's doing very good,'' Tzakis said at a news
conference Thursday.
   The man could have been saved with a new liver alone, but
doctors worried the single organ might have failed without a new
pancreas to overcome the diabetes.
   The pancreas, a pear-shaped organ behind the stomach, produces
insulin, a hormone needed to convert sugar, starches and other food
into energy. Severe diabetes prevents the body from producing or
properly using insulin, making daily injections necessary.
   Complications include kidney and heart disease, blindness, nerve
damage and gangrene leading to amputation. Tzakis' patient had
experienced only mild nerve damage and eye problems, which studies
show can sometimes be reversed.
   ``Our patient was an ideal candidate for this operation because
he unfortunately suffered from both diabetes and hepatitis, had the
proper motivation to undergo a complicated procedure and understood
the risk,'' Tzakis said.
   The operation had been performed only twice before, both times
in England, according to Tzakis.
   The patient was in serious condition Thursday, considered
normal, with the main threats being organ rejection or infection,
Tzakis said. He could be discharged in a month or so and remain
near the hospital for another few weeks before returning home.
   Two other diabetics currently are awaiting liver-pancreas
transplants in Pittsburgh, according to Tzakis.

<HEAD>Experts: Public Interest In Climate May Dry Up After Drought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SMYRNA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public interest in the Earth's troubled
climate may be washed away with the heavy rains that are needed to
end the current U.S. drought, weather experts warned during a
drought symposium here.
   ``Society tends to flit from hysteria to hysteria,'' said Pat
Michaels, Virginia's state climatologist and moderator of the
symposium.
   He said the 1988 drought, although not as dry as a 1986 drought
in many places, has drawn much attention because some of the
affected areas include large media centers.
   ``I'm worried ... that when the next drought happens, we are
going to have to rediscover the climate problem,'' said Michaels,
president of the Association of State Climatologists.
   Experts said Thursday that the greenhouse effect _ the warming
of the Earth's atmosphere _ has brought needed attention to changes
in the global climate, even though it is not directly related to
the drought.
   Many of the 13 climatologists and meterologists at the symposium
agreed that the Earth's temperature is warming, but they debated
whether it is a short- or long-term phenomenon and its impact on
Earth.
   However, Alan Hecht, director of the National Climate Program in
Washington, D.C., said the uncertainty means policymakers should
begin to deal with the possible effects, especially undertaking
policies that ``make sense in their own right.''
   Mankind must reduce reliance on fossil fuels, he said, by
becoming more energy efficient, replanting forests and
investigating alternative energy supplies.
   Scientists have warned in recent years that Earth's atmosphere
is gaining in carbon dioxide and other gases, which trap heat and
cause the overall temperature to rise. Besides fossil fuels, the
depletion of forests in South America has been blamed for the
increase of carbon dioxide and methane.
   Some have warned that higher temperature will change the
character of many countries, for example drying out the U.S.
Midwest or melting polar ice caps.
   The symposium was sponsored by The Weather Channel, an
Atlanta-based cable network, which broadcast the meeting live.
   Earlier Thursday, the climatologists were told the movement of
planets and the moon and sunspots may help lead to drought in the
Southeast.
   ``There is some evidence that as Jupiter goes around the sun at
its fastest point, there are drought conditions in the Southeast in
the months of April and October,'' Georgia state climatologist
Gayther Plummer said.
   However, David Rodenhuis, director of the federal Climate
Analysis Center in Washington, said he was skeptical of Plummer's
thesis.
   ``There's an enormous number of possibilities that one could
chase,'' Rodenhuis said. ``The next business of the scientist is to
... extend the range of analysis and look for cause and effect.''

   A man charged with killing seven people
and wounding three others at a defense plant said on a tape played
in court that he quit his shooting spree after ``it wasn't fun
anymore.''
   Richard Wade Farley also told police that if the woman who
spurned him had gone out with him ``just once'' he would have left
her alone. Farley's obsession with his former co-worker apparently
culminated in the killings, police said.
   ``I hope she'll never do this to anybody else again. She can't
play with people's lives,'' Farley, 39, said of Laura Black in a
telephone conversation with a police hostage negotiator taped
during the 5-hour siege at ESL Inc. on Feb. 16.
   The tape was played at Farley's preliminary hearing Thursday at
Santa Clara County Municipal Court.
   He indicated to police Lt. Ruben Grijalva on the tape that he
was still angry with Black for spurning his advances. He said Black
got him fired from the company by disclosing a series of letters
he'd written to her.
   Farley also told Grijalva that he knew only one of the 10 people
he gunned down. He said on the tape that the rest just ``popped
up'' in the hallways of the company, and he shot them.
   The former ESL software engineer is charged with seven counts of
murder, three counts of attempted murder, felony vandalism and
second-degree burglary. Police say he walked into the building
loaded down with weapons and ammunition and fired at least 100
rounds.
   ESL is primarily involved in developing computer programs for
Department of Defense classified projects.
   Speaking in a distinctive Texas twang, Farley told Grijalva on
the tape that, ``I came down here to do as much damage to equipment
at ESL as possible.''
   Once he had ``run around and got through being upset it wasn't
any fun anymore,'' he said on the tape.
   Shortly before he surrendered to authorities, he asked Grijalva
on the telephone if Black was still alive.
   ``She can't regret it if she doesn't live,'' he said in the tape.
   He said he believed Black took an ``immediate dislike'' to him.
``She tried to avoid me like the plague,'' he said.
   However, he said on the tape that he has had Black listed on his
life insurance policy as his beneficiary.

<HEAD>Prosecutors To Investigate 1,500 Suspected Nazi War Criminals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOGNE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cologne justice officials are about
to open murder investigations against about 1,500 suspected Nazi
war criminals, most of whom served in France, authorities said.
   Willi Dressen, an official with the West German Central Office
for the Investigation of Nazi War Crimes, said Thursday he would
turn over the names to Cologne prosecutors soon.
   Dressen said the estimated 1,500 names were obtained by his
office from United Nations archives.
   Most of the crimes concern transportation of Jews from France to
Nazi death camps, and most of the suspects are former Nazi secret
police or security officials who worked in France, Dressen said.
   Hans-Joachim Roeseler, a Cologne prosecutor whose specialty is
probing Nazi war crimes, said he was ``fighting against time'' and
he expected the investigations to be extremely difficult.
   ``Many witnesses have already died, or are not able to testify
because of their age, or are scattered around the world,'' Roeseler
said.
   Officials did not say whether all the suspects were known to be
still alive, nor did they provide any details on any of the cases.
   Dressen's office is responsible for initial investigations into
suspected Nazi war criminals and does not have prosecutorial powers.
   If there is ground for further investigation and possible
prosecution, the cases are turned over to prosecuting authorities.
   Since the end of World War II, the Ludwigsburg-based Central
Office for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes has carried out nearly
100,000 investigations, with more than 6,000 people convicted and
sent to prison.

<TEXT>
   A convoy of 67 trucks rolled into town
loaded with more than 45,000 bales of hay donated by Southern
farmers returning a favor to Ohio farmers, who are short of
livestock feed because of the drought.
   ``It's the greatest feeling in the world,'' said Charlie Rabb,
an Ellerbe, N.C., farmer who received donated Ohio hay during a
1986 drought. ``I should be home now. But you guys helped us two
years ago, and I'll never forget it.''
   The caravan was greeted Thursday night by people who stopped
their cars to wave from an interstate overpass and by Gov. Richard
Celeste, who thanked Rabb and others for the donated hay and labor.
   ``We're really very grateful for the generosity and human spirit
of these folks who we wanted to help a couple of years ago and who
now are helping us in an extraordinary way,'' Celeste said.
   The trucks carried 45,000 to 48,000 bales, said Tom Cotter of
the organizing Charlotte Motor Speedway.
   ``We're paying it back with interest,'' Cotter said, referring
to the farmers' hay gift in 1986. ``We took 20,000 bales two years
ago, and we're bringing back more than twice that, so we're happy.''
   The hay will be distributed to farmers in several counties
starting today, the Ohio Department of Agriculture said.
   More than 100 volunteers helped unload the hay, including eight
prisoners from the London Correctional Institution, about 30 miles
west of Columbus.
   North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin sent the trucks on their way
early Thursday, giving each driver the green flag as the convoy
made one lap around the 1.5-mile NASCAR superspeedway before
leaving.
   The convoy included about 20 rigs that normally haul NASCAR race
cars and trucks donated by companies and independent truckers.

<HEAD>China Calls for Communists and Nationalists to Join Hands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's leading daily said today the Communist
Party regards the Nationalist Party on Taiwan as its counterpart
and expressed disappointment that a recent Nationalist congress did
not end a ban on contacts with the mainland.
   The People's Daily, the official voice of the party, said in a
front-page editorial that the two parties have ``unshirkable
duties'' to carry forth the great traditions of the Chinese people.
   ``What we can contribute to the future of our nation and mankind
is unlimited. We hope that the two parties can rid themselves of
past differences and unite hand-in-hand to achieve the cause that
was left unfinished by our ancestors.''
   The Communist and Nationalist parties formed common fronts in
the 1920s and 1930s to fight Chinese warlords and the invading
Japanese, but fought a civil war following the end of World War II
that ended in the flight of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists to
Taiwan in 1949.
   The editorial said China ``highly appreciated'' the 13th
Nationalist Party Congress for dismissing the idea of an
independent Taiwan and calling for efforts to attain the historic
task of reunification.
   ``We believe that the trend of relaxing tensions will develop
after the conclusion of the 13th Party Congress. This is what the
people of the two sides expect,'' it said.
   But the daily expressed disappointment that the Nationalists
made no change in their policies of regarding the Communists as
enemies and maintaining the ``three nos'' policy of no contact, no
negotiations and no compromise with the mainland.
   ``This is really against the times and will of the people,'' it
said.
   The Nationalists, while saying the ban on official contacts will
stay, did approve a plan to ease the ban on visits to Taiwan by
mainland Chinese residents, allow import of raw materials from
China and permit Taiwan business investment on the mainland if it
is conducted through a third country.
   Last year the Taipei government removed restrictions on visits
to the mainland by Taiwan residents. Tens of thousands of tourists,
businessmen and people visiting family have since traveled to the
mainland.
   The editorial also said the Nationalists are unreasonable in
their statements that the Communist Party and the people of the
mainland should be separated.
   The Communist Party, it said, has become one with the people of
the mainland.
   The daily said China continues to welcome people from Taiwan for
visits and business and expressed confidence that the policy of
``one country, two systems'' can help reunify the nation.
   Under that system, Hong Kong is to retain its capitalist system
for 50 years after Britain returns the colony to China in 1997.

   A Denver neighborhood where two teen-agers were
shot and killed in a 24-hour period is ``at a very explosive point
right now,'' a minister who works with local gangs says.
   An undercover police detective Thursday shot and killed a
teen-ager who allegedly pointed a gun at him across the street from
the scene of a Wednesday night gang-related shooting death, a
police spokeswoman said.
   Rasheen Abdul Riley, 18, was pronounced dead at Denver General
Hospital, said Anne Montoya, police department spokeswoman.
   The plainsclothes detective, Bernard Montoya, yelled ``police''
and then shot Riley after Riley pointed a pistol at him in the
Fuller Park area, Ms. Montoya said.
   Undercover police officers had gone to the area to quiet a crowd
that had gathered to console Gracie Carolina, whose son was killed
Wednesday, Ms. Montoya said.
   One of the officers spotted four or five men lying in the park,
at least one of them with a gun, she said.
   ``This thing was just inflamed over there,'' said officer D.E.
Lindley.
   On Wednesday, Delontay Carolina, 16, was killed in a drive-by
shooting incident, Ms. Montoya said. He was reportedly shot at by
three people in a four-wheel-drive vehicle.
   One juvenile was in custody and warrants were issued for a
second juvenile and Darryl Wilson, 22, of Denver, she said.
   Authorities said the two shootings were not related. ``It is two
unfortunate incidents that occurred in the same area, but it's not
a related incident,'' said Ms. Montoya.
   The Rev. Leon Kelly, who works with youths at the Salvation Army
Red Shield Center, had said before the shooting that the animosity
gang members feel toward each other might spread to police officers
and that the neighborhood is ``at a very explosive point right
now.''
   He said the shooting Wednesday was inevitable. ``It was going to
happen,'' he said. ``It was just a matter of time.
   There have been at least two other gang shooting incidents in
the neighborhood in the past two months.

   A mother stabbed her 4-year-old daughter
to death and then fatally turned the knife on herself as her
2-year-old son hid in a rear bedroom of their apartment, according
to police.
   Laverne Romero, 20, was pronounced dead Thursday night at Eden
Hospital Medical Center in Castro Valley from multiple stab wounds
to the chest and abdomen. The girl, Veronica Ponce, died in surgery.
   Romero's son, Felipe Ponce, was unharmed, said Sgt. Thomas West.
The boy will be placed in protective custody, police said.
   West said the incident apparently occurred in the kitchen and
that Romero used at least three knives from the kitchen set.
   He said Romero, a single parent, ``was emotionally upset over
something'' and apparently stabbed the child several times before
she stabbed herself.
   Edward Ortega, a neighbor, said he could hear the girl scream:
``No, Mommy. Help, Mommy.''

   A batch of bad chicken salad was
believed to have caused an outbreak of food poisoning among 500
people who ate at the U.S. Air Force Academy's dining hall,
officials said.
   Most of the cadets were treated at the Academy hospital and sent
back to their rooms, a spokesman in the public affairs office said
Thursday.
   None was in serious or critical condition, officials said. By
Thursday afternoon, 330 of the 500 treated were released.
   About 200 medical personnel, including some from Peterson Air
Force Base and Fort Carson, were called in to assist after
Tuesday's lunch of chicken salad, which contained salmonella
bacteria.
   The salmonella bacteria causes food poisoning, with symptoms
including nausea, diarrhea, fever and dehydration. The recovery
period is normally 12 to 18 hours with more serious cases taking
two to three days.

   A former police officer was in custody today
after an eight-hour standoff in which he shot and critically
wounded a policeman and injured another man who attempted to evict
him from his home, authorities said.
   The suspect, identified as Tommie L. Hudson, 46, surrendered
Thursday waving a white flag, after about 50 canisters of tear gas
were fired into his home, police said. He was charged with
attempted murder, said Detective Jack Segers.
   Officer Bernard Domagala, 37, was shot in the forehead some six
hours after the suspect barricaded himself in the house, said
police and hospital officials.
   Domagala was listed in critical but stable condition early
today, but police said he was expected to survive.
   ``When the officer was brought into the emergency room, he was
conscious and he was talking to paramedics,'' said Commander
Richard Dwyer.
   Also wounded was Edgar Luna, a mover who was shot in the arm as
he was trying to evict Hudson earlier in the day for non-payment of
his mortgage, police said.
   They said the incident began when three movers tried to move
Hudson and his belongings from the building. When Hudson failed to
answer the front door, Luna knocked out a door panel with a
sledgehammer, authorities said. The door opened, and they saw
Hudson inside with a shotgun, said Deputy Sheriff John Knight.
   Knight said Hudson fired three shots and hit Luna, 27, who was
treated at a hospital and released.
   Domagala was shot as police negotiators were trying to talk
Hudson into surrendering in the late aftenoon. Police said Domagala
was peeking around a corner of the building and was shot from about
100 feet away with a handgun.
   Hudson had five handguns and a shotgun, authorities said.
   An Air Force veteran, Hudson was a patrolman from 1966 to 1971,
when he was terminated after he exhausted his medical leave with
the department but was still out sick, said Police Superintendent
LeRoy Martin.
   The superintendent refused to discuss Hudson's medical problems,
although he said Hudson was arrested in 1986 for shooting two dogs.
   Arthur Selikoff, spokesman for the Veterans Administration, said
the VA took possession of Hudson's brownstone house after Hudson
failed to pay his mortgage, which was insured by the VA. He said
Hudson had not made a mortgage payment since August 1984.

<HEAD>Boy Trapped in Freezer Four Hours Is Revived</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 8-year-old boy reaching for Popsicles on a
hot day became trapped in a chest freezer for four hours and his
body temperature dropped nearly 30 degrees before doctors were able
to revive him.
   ``It's kind of a miracle,'' said Dr. Stephen Evans, director of
the emergency room at St. Joseph Hospital in suburban Lorain, where
Joseph Krogg of Sheffield Lake was brought Thursday night.
   ``I have never seen anything like this in my 12 years in
medicine,'' Evans said.
   Doctors used intravenous fluids and warm blankets to slowly warm
Joseph's body, Evans said. The boy was listed in extremely critical
condition early today at Rainbow Babies' and Children's Hospital in
Cleveland.
   The youngster was reported missing by his parents after he
disappeared Thursday afternoon, when the temperature soared into
the 90s.
   Joseph apparently fell in the freezer while trying to retrieve
some Popsicles, his father, Dale Krogg, told Evans. The lid closed
on Joseph and he was trapped. Because of the freezer's location,
any pounding or yelling would not be heard.
   Krogg, who had last seen his son about noon, found him at 6:30
p.m. when he went to the freezer in the family's garage to get meat
for dinner.
   When Joseph was brought to the hospital at 7 p.m., Evans told
Krogg the chances of resuscitating the boy were one in a million.
   His body temperature had dropped to 70 degrees, icicles had
formed on his body and he had no pulse. His heart had stopped
beating, Evans said.
   About 11 p.m., Joseph's heart began beating again and by 1 a.m.
his vital signs were good, he had a strong pulse and good blood
pressure and his temperature had returned to normal, the physician
said.
   ``Obviously, he is not out of the woods yet,'' Evans said.
   It will take several days to determine whether Joseph has
suffered any brain damage, Evans said.

   Debra Murphree, the prostitute who bared her
soul and much more about fallen television evangelist Jimmy
Swaggart, has returned to her home town to live with her parents.
   Ms. Murphree, 28, said she plans to earn a high school
equivalency degree and become an interior decorator.
   ``Everybody's happy to see me home,'' said Ms. Murphree, after
recently completing a 10-city tour promoting her story. ``Nobody's
said anything to me, you know, rough or anything.''
   Earlier this year, Ms. Murphree said Swaggart paid her $20 a
visit and asked her to pose naked, talk dirty and perform other
acts. Swaggart has declined to answer any of her allegations.
   She has since told her story on ``Donahue,'' ``Larry King'' and
``Geraldo.'' Penthouse Magazine reportedly paid her between $75,000
and $100,000 to recreate the poses she said Swaggart paid her to
assume.
   The Assemblies of God ultimately defrocked Swaggart after he
acknowledged Feb. 21 that he had committed an unspecified sin and
then refused to accept the denomination's recommendation that he
take a year off from preaching.

<HEAD>Conservatives Win First Election Of Thatcher's Third Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a mixture of relief and jubilation, Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party today celebrated a
narrow victory in the first special parliamentary election of her
third term.
   Party chairman Peter Brooke hailed the Tory win in west London's
Kensington district as ``a solid vote of confidence in the
government and its policies.''
   Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson said, ``If there was a time for
protest, this was it _ and the opposition parties cold not
capitalize on it.''
   He said the Conservatives had done well, considering this was
the first chance for voters to protest Mrs. Thatcher's
controversial third term program, which includes an unpopular new
property tax.
   But voters in Kensington, where royal palaces and high-rise
tenements crowd into three square miles, drastically cut the
Conservatives' winning margin in the election Thursday.
   Conservative candidate Dudley Fishburn was declared the winner
with 9,829 votes to 9,014 for second-placed Labor's Ann Holmes when
results were announced early today.
   The winning margin was 815 votes. At the general election in
June 1987, the Conservatives' winning margin over second-placed
Labor in the 48,500-voter district was 4,500.
   The result was bad news for Labor. Bookmakers heavily favored
the Conservatives to keep the Kensington seat, but many political
commentators said Labor had a good chance of victory due to
widespread hostility to Mrs. Thatcher's latest policies.
   Since the 1987 general election, her government has introduced
laws to impose an unpopular new property tax, shaken up the welfare
system and ordered a review of the cherished National Health
Service.
   Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock, on a swing through southern
Africa, said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.
from Harare, Zimbabwe: ``I was optimistic about the possibility of
winning.''
   But he said the current contest for the Labor leadership had
helped damage the party's chances.
   Former Labor Cabinet minister Tony Benn, a hardline leftist, has
issued a formal challenge to take over from Kinnock as Labor leader
and the party is scheduled to vote on the issue this fall.
   Kinnock has renewed warnings to left-wing dissidents that Labor
must adapt its policies or risk a fourth successive general
election defeat. But in response, Benn has accused Kinnock of
seeking to water down Labor's anti-nuclear defense policy and its
traditional demands for more state ownership.
   The outcome of the Kensington poll was also bad news for
Britain's two centrist parties, which paid the price for an
acrimonious merger last spring of their former electoral alliance.
   Both the merged party, the Social and Liberal Democratic Party,
and a breakaway Social Democratic Party ran candidates, splitting
the already minority centrist vote.
   The Social and Liberal Democratic Party candidate William
Goodhart trailed third with 2,546 votes. The Social Democratic
Party candidate John Martin was fourth with 1,190 votes.
   The election of Fishburn, 42, an Eton and Harvard-educated
former senior editor on the respected weekly, The Economist, means
that the Conservatives' huge 101-seat majority over all the other
parties combined in the 650-seat House of Commons remains unchanged.
   The seat had been held for the Conservatives for 20 years by
legislator Sir Brandon Rhys Williams. The election was caused by
his death last November.
   The lackluster campaign in Kensington, which contains thousand
of highly transient apartment dwellers, failed to excite local
electors and only 51 percent voted.
   The Kensington constituency is one of the most starkly divided
in Britain. In its southern part, rows of elegant period houses
belong to some of the wealthiest people in the country.
   Kensington Palace is the London home of Prince Charles and
Princess Diana. Charles' aunt, Princess Margaret, and his cousin,
Prince Michael of Kent, also have apartments in the palace.
   North Kensington, a high immigrant district, is characterized by
shabby streets of state-subsidized housing.

   Powerful thunderstorms rumbled through sections of the
drought-battered Midwest today, triggering a flash flood watch in
southwest Nebraska, after storms in the Northeast toppled a barn
and downed power lines.
   Thunderstorms dropped heavy rain on Nebraska, and were building
in eastern North Dakota and northern Minnesota, where a severe
thunderstorm watch was in effect this morning.
   On Thursday, strong thunderstorms slapped New York state, New
Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont and New Hampshire,
knocking down trees and power lines.
   High winds toppled a barn in Winchendon, Mass., and overturned a
60-foot-long trailer and blew a roof off a house in Bethel, N.Y.
Hail fell in Goshen and Sussex, N.J., and 4 inches of rain fell in
one hour in Agawam, Mass.
   In the Midwest, powerful storms Thursday generated a tornado
that hit near Palisade in southwest Nebraska, winds gusting to 75
mph and 1}-inch hail in Gothenburg, Neb.
   Thunderstorms in the drought-hit Ohio Valley downed trees in
Indiana, and dropped hail up to an inch in diameter in Ohio and
Illinois.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
in Florida, widely scattered showers and thunderstorms in upper
Michigan, Wisconsin, northern Illinois, northeast Iowa and eastern
Minnesota.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 70s and 80s from New
England to the lower Great Lakes, Michigan, northern Wisconsin and
Minnesota, and from Montana to the northern Pacific Coast; the
upper 60s to the low 80s along the California coast; in the upper
90s to more than 100 degrees from Illinois to Missouri and the
southern two-thirds of the Plains; near 115 degrees in eastern
California and the desert Southwest; and the 90s in the rest of the
nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 46
degrees at Kalispell, Mont., to 95 at Phoenix, Ariz., and Luke Air
Force Base at Glendale, Ariz.

   No sun, no sand, no uneven tan is the
promise at a coin-operated laundry where customers bask under the
lights while their clothes spin in the machines.
   Joe Thomas, taking a cue from laundries that have installed
delis and bars, put a tanning bed at his laundry this spring and
the tanning lights stay on most of the day.
   ``It's called Joe's Washing Machine but I'm changing the name
right now to Joe's Washing Machine and Tanning Room,'' his mother,
Helen Archer, said Thursday.
   Mrs. Archer, who helps run the business, said her son ``has a
lot of ideas on everything, if there's a dollar involved.
   ``We had an extra room here and he wondered what we would do
with it. Then he came in one day and said we were going to put a
tanning bed back there.''
   ``We're thinking about putting in another bed,'' she said. ``The
room is big enough. We can put in a partition and have two beds.''
   ``We have a lot of young people coming in here,'' Mrs. Archer
said. ``About February they start talking about getting a tan. They
would shift from one foot to another while waiting for their
clothes.
   ``Now they can wash their clothes and get a tan and we can make
money all at the same time,'' she said. ``It tans people top and
bottom, on both sides, and they don't have to turn over.''
   The bed costs $4 for 15 minutes.

<HEAD>Strikers Converge On Capital</HEAD>

   About 1,500 striking workers from a
bankrupt food-processing plant converged on the capital today to
demand higher wages and more work, Belgrade radio reported.
   The employees of the Agrokomerc company were met by hundreds of
Belgrade police officers who sealed off an area around the
Parliament building, the scene of several previous protests by
disaffected workers in this cash-strapped country. No incidents
were reported today.
   The workers walked off their jobs at the plant in Velika Kladusa
on Thursday, filed into buses late last night and arrived here this
morning to give their complaints to officials, the radio reported.
Velika Kladusa is 250 miles west of Belgrade.
   The radio said a government delegation agreed to hold talks with
the workers.
   About 8,000 Agrokomerc workers are receiving guaranteed minimum
salaries of about $50 monthly, ``which is not enough for
survival,'' Fuad Pasalic, the head of the company's trade union,
was quoted by the radio as telling government officials.
   ``Our children are hungry and have no clothes to wear,'' he
said. He told the government delegation that the workers would not
leave Belgrade until they are given at least $70 a month, the radio
reported.
   The employees also are demanding the replacement of some city
and company officials.
   About 5,000 Agrokomerc workers walked off their jobs Thursday
and 2,000 marched through Velika Kladusa.
   The state Tanjug news agency said that many workers then decided
to head for Belgrade, ``to present their problems to the federal
parliament officials.''
   Agrokomerc was declared bankrupt after it issued uncovered
promissory notes worth the equivalent of about $1 billion.
   Charged with embezzlement and other charges are Fikret Abdic,
the firm's managing director, and several of his associates. They
currently are being tried in Bihac, a Bosnian town near Velika
Kladusa.
   Workers have staged several marches in the streets after the
introduction in May of a government austerity program that allowed
substantial price increases and hefty wage cuts.
   Hungary's austerity measures are designed to curb the country's
175 percent annual inflation and help in repaying a $21 billion
foreign debt by introducing a more market-oriented economy.

<TEXT>
   The murder of a 19-year-old black woman
whose body had been scrawled with the letters ``KKK'' may have been
racially motivated, the Ulster County district attorney says.
   ``A racial motive obviously is a legitimate investigatory lead
and we're actively pursuing it,'' Michael Kavanagh said Thursday.
``We don't know that (the killing) was racially inspired ... If it
is racially inspired, that's a horrible development.''
   The letters were scrawled on the body of Anna Kithcart,
apparently with a sharp instrument, Kavanagh said at a news
conference. Miss Kithcart's body was found Tuesday on an abandoned
railroad bed. She was last seen Monday evening.
   There are ``certain parallels'' between the murder and the
Tawana Brawley case, but there was no evidence of a connection in
the cases, Kavanagh said.
   Meanwhile, the Rev. Al Sharpton, an adviser to Miss Brawley's
family, said Thursday that he and his associates would start their
own investigation into whether there was any connection between the
cases.
   Miss Brawley, 16, of Wappingers Falls was found last November
with the letters ``KKK'' and racial epithets scrawled in a
charcoal-like substance on her skin after being missing for four
days. She later said she had been abducted and raped by a group of
white men, but she and her family have refused to cooperate with
the investigation.
   Kingston is about 25 miles north of Wappingers Falls, on the
opposite shore of the Hudson River.
   The existence of the letters on Miss Kitchcart's body was
withheld for more than two days to allow detectives time to
question hundreds of people before the case attracted widespread
attention, said police Chief James Riggins.
   ``I think that if we had announced this from the onset, we would
have had every nut in town calling us up,'' Riggins said.
   Riggins conferred with the FBI, he said, and was told the agency
was unaware of any activities in the area by the Ku Klux Klan or
similar groups.
   Preliminary autopsy results indicated Miss Kithcart was
strangled and struck on the head with a blunt instrument, Riggins
said. A bite on the neck and other marks also were found on her
body.
   Meanwhile, a man arrested Wednesday on a misdemeanor charge for
allegedly ``engaging in sexual conduct'' with Miss Kithcart's
corpse remained in jail on $10,000 bail. Police described the man,
Joseph Kiernan, 41, as a transient.
   The Kingston Daily Freeman reported Thursday that the young
woman's father, Eugene Kithcart, said he hadn't seen his daughter
in two months and believed that she had fallen victim to drugs.
   ``I'm almost positive it was a drug rub,'' Kithcart told the
newspaper.

<TEXT>
   The government said it will approve a new
anti-cocaine law that will ban most coca plantations and impose
tougher sentences on drug dealers and corrupt officials.
   The law is the first ban in Bolivia on cultivation of the coca
leaf, which is used to produce cocaine.
   The measure was approved by the lower house of Congress last
week and by the Senate on Thursday. President Victor Paz Estenssoro
said he will sign the law when it reaches his desk.
   The law limits coca plant cultivation to 29,652 acres and bans
production on 76,601 acres. Farmers will receive $2,000 for every
hectare of coca plants they destroy, with $365 of that amount
provided by the United States, which has long pressured Bolivia to
crack down on its cocaine trade.
   The law also toughens penalties against drug traffickers, coca
leaf producers and public officials who take bribes from drug
dealers or who interfere with the prosecution of traffickers.
   ``Over the next five years if the government can get
international backing, cocaine trafficking as it is known in
Bolivia can be seriously interrupted,'' said Frank Mocolini, head
of the DEA office in La Paz.
   Bolivia, South America's poorest country, produces an estimated
one-third of the cocaine that reaches U.S. and European markets.
   Last week, thousands of coca leaf farmers attacked a police and
U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency camp in the Chapare coca-leaf
producing region. Police say at least nine farmers and one
policeman were killed.

   A woman ordered by a judge to pay full
restitution for embezzling from an insurance company is accused of
generating the money by stealing from her next employer.
   Ernestine Allen, 37, was sentenced last August to one month's
probation and ordered to repay the $10,300 stolen from Gulf Life
Insurance Co. She told prosecutors family members had agreed to
loan her the money for restitution.
   She was arrested in June 1987 on grand theft charges after Gulf
Life's parent, Gulf Group Service Corp., discovered she had been
writing checks for undocumented insurance claims.
   Mrs. Allen later found a new job at Southeastern Metals
Manufacturing Co. Inc. and repaid the cash, but was charged
Wednesday with second-degree grand theft and five counts of forgery.
   Assistant State Attorney Lance Day said Mrs. Allen took $47,725
from Southeastern Metals by writing 87 payroll checks to a former
employee and depositing the checks in her own bank account.
   Day also accused Mrs. Allen of writing five fraudulent money
orders for a total of $21,100, including one for $10,300, the
amount of the insurance company restitution.
   Bond was set at $45,000 for Mrs. Allen, who was being held in
the Duval County Jail.

   Colombian guerrillas have agreed to
free a leading political figure they have been holding since May.
   A communique released Thursday after five hours of negotiations
at the Vatican Embassy here said the M-19 Movement would release
Alvaro Gomez Hurtado before a ``summit meeting'' of Colombian
leaders July 29. Hurtado is a former presidential candidate in
Colombia.
   The leftist group reiterated an offer of a cease-fire, the
statement said. Papal Nuncio Jose Sebastian Laboa read the
communique from representatives of the movement, the Roman Catholic
Church, labor unions and business.
   It said the decisions were made ``in the spirit of finding
routes that lead to a more equitable society, to the preservation
of human rights and reconciliation among Colombians.''
   A seven-member commission from the Conservative and Liberal
parties, the Patriotic Union, labor, industry, the guerrilla
movements and the church, based in Bogota, should prepare an agenda
for the meeting after Gomez Hurtado is released, the communique
said.
   ``The order for the release of Dr. Gomez will be issued by
Carlos Pizarro Leon, commander of M-19 at the earliest opportunity
that circumstances permit,'' it said.
   The communique said the government should participate in the
summit ``to contribute to the success of its deliberations.''
   The movement's formal name is the April 19 Movement.

   Gunmen fired on a parked bus
near Durban, killing the sleeping driver and wounding several
passengers, police said.
   The bus was parked in the black township of Inanda when men
fired on the vehicle at 1:30 a.m. Thursday, police said.
   Police said the bus had come from Transkei, one of four tribal
lands declared independent by the government but not recognized as
such outside South Africa. No other details were released.
   Also, police said four cars were damaged today from an explosion
behind a bus shelter in Claremont, a multiracial community that is
legally designated for whites. Police gave no further information
on the 12:45 a.m. attack.
   Police also reported finding the body of a black man who had
been stabbed to death in Ashdown, in Natal province. Supporters of
the anti-apartheid United Democratic Front and the Inkatha
organization have been fighting in the province for more than a
year.
   More than 400 people died last year in fighting among blacks
from the two political groups in the Zulu townships around
Pietermaritzburg. The violence has died down, but both sides still
accuse the other of periodic attacks.
   Police also reported that gasoline bombs had been hurled at the
home of a former town councillor in the Dobsonville area of Soweto
Wednesday night, extensively damaging the four-room home of Colin
Radebe and slightly injuring him. The family spent the night
extinquishing the fire and removing debris from the house.

   Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip are
facing a cash shortage because of curfews imposed by the Israelis
and strikes ordered by leaders of the Arab uprising, a United
Nations official said today.
   The curfews also have disrupted food supplies to Gaza, the
Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported today. But the U.N. official
said there is no food shortage in the region, where 650,000
Palestinians live.
   An 18-year-old Palestinian, meanwhile, was shot in the left leg
today when soldiers clashed with Moslem worshippers leaving a
mosque in the Bureij refugee camp in Gaza, a local reporter said.
An army spokesman had no information about the clash.
   The youths hurled rocks at the troops, who tried to disperse
them with tear gas and rubber bullets and finally used live
ammunition, wounding the man, who was identified as Ayman Taha, the
reporter said.
   An 11-year-old Palestinian was shot in the leg late Thursday in
Gaza's Shati refugee camp, hospital officials and Arab sources
said. They said the boy was shot when youths hurled rocks at
soldiers, who responded with tear gas and live gunfire.
   
   But an army spokesman said the Israeli army was not involved in
the incident. ``This is not an army matter. This is a local police
matter, and that's all I'm going to say,'' he said.
   The Gaza police spokesman was not in his office for comment, but
a policeman who answered the telephone at Gaza police headquarters
said he knew nothing of the incident.
   Since the Arab uprising began seven months ago, 222 Palestinians
and four Israelis have been killed.
   In the occupied West Bank, a curfew on Nablus, where 120,000
Arabs live, entered its fourth day today. Curfews also continued in
the town of Qalqilya, the Beit Sahour village and Aidah refugee
camp near Bethlehem, and the Ein Yabroud and Anabta villages.
   The longest curfew is in Beit Sahour, where villagers have been
restricted to their homes for eight days after a symbolic protest
in which Palestinians returned their Israeli-issued identity papers.
   A United Nations official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said similar restrictions were imposed on the Bureij refugee camp
in Gaza, where the army imposed a 15-day curfew last month after
the local Arab municipality resigned.
   Workers were barred from leaving to work in Israel for almost
six weeks, resulting in a cash shortage, the U.N. official said.
   Curfews have been lifted in all Gaza camps, but strikes ordered
by underground Palestinian leaders also have prevented workers from
reaching their jobs, the official said.
   Nevertheless, U.N. food trucks delivering basic food products
were continuing to arrive as scheduled, the official said.
   ``There is no food shortage in Gaza; what you've got is
shortages of money,'' the U.N. source said.
   The Ha'aretz newspaper quoted an Israeli reserve soldier as
saying, ``In the past few days I have given out watermelons,
cantaloupes and some even come and beg me for bread. We know there
is a severe food shortage in the camps.''

   A jury cleared a 19-year-old man of attempted
murder and other charges in the Howard Beach racial attack because
of a faulty identification and other ``loose ends,'' jurors said.
   A second jury is considering lesser charges against four other
defendants accused in the 1986 attack by a white gang on three
blacks, one of whom was killed by a car as he fled the mob in the
Queens neighborhood.
   Thomas Gucciardo was found innocent Thursday of attempted
murder, assault and riot after three days of deliberations. Cheers
filled the courtroom when the verdict was announced. Gucciardo
smiled broadly and hung his head back in relief.
   ``I was scared, but I knew that I hadn't done anything wrong,''
Gucciardo said. He said he was going to ``celebrate, then go back
to school'' at St. John's University.
   His eyes misting, he said, ``I'll go home the first time in a
year and a half a free man.''
   Gucciardo was charged with beating Cedric Sandiford with a tree
limb during the attack that left 23-year-old Michael Griffith dead.
Sandiford, 37, testified he was beaten by the gang until he feigned
unconsciousness.
   Three youths were convicted of manslaughter in an earlier trial.
A fourth youth was acquitted at that trial.
   Jury foreman George Isaris said, ``We had trouble with
identification. It was uncorroborated, and there were a lot of
other loose ends.''
   Gale Vinnette, one of two black jurors, said the description
given by Sandiford of the attacker ``did not match with the person
we saw.''
   Griffith's mother, Jean Griffith, said Thursday's verdict ``is
not justice.''
   ``Nobody knows the pain of what we're going through. For me, I
have nothing. ... I lost everything. My son is dead,'' she said.
   ``We picked the jury,'' said Ed Boyar, an asstant special
prosecutor. ``We believed they would be fair-minded people. For me
to criticize their verdict would be worse than sour grapes,'' he
said.
   The second jury is considering charges of riot against William
Bollander, Thomas Farino and James Povinelli, all 18, and John
Saggese, 20.
   ``I hope our jury sees it the way this jury does,'' said
Povinelli.

<HEAD>Businessman Hailed by Reagan as `Hero for 80s' Testifies at
Wedtech Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a day of fraught, sometimes rambling
testimony, Wedtech Corp. founder John Mariotta said illiteracy kept
him from knowing about the illegal goings-on at his scandal-plagued
company.
   ``My reading ability will go as far as a comic book is
concerned. Don't try to tell me to read The (New York) Times or any
technical thing. That's not my game,'' Mariotta, 58, testified
Thursday at his racketeering trial.
   Once hailed by President Reagan as a ``hero for the '80s,''
Mariotta is on trial with Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-Bronx, and five
others on charges of turning Wedtech into a racketeering enterprise
that paid out millions in bribes to obtain government contracts.
   Mariotta denied those allegations, but it was his wide-ranging
stream-of-consciousness responses to his attorney's questions,
accompanied by fist-pounding, hand-wringing and finger-waving, that
provided the courtroom drama.
   Mariotta, the son of Puerto Rican immigrants, has claimed he is
virtually illiterate and that other company executives kept him in
the dark about their illegal activities.
   ``My writing ability is nil,'' said Mariotta, lives in
Scarsdale, a wealthy New York suburb. ``For 20 years you could look
at my company's records, you will not find one letter or any
documentation or anything in my handwriting.''
   Asked if he finished high school, Mariotta, who grew up in New
York's Spanish Harlem, spoke of his parents' fights over his
father's drinking, nights spent riding the subways with his mother,
run-ins with truant officers and his difficulties taking tests.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary Shannon complained to the judge
that Mariotta was telling stories irrelevant to his lawyer's
questions.
   With jurors out of the room she asked U.S. District Judge
Constance Baker Motley to make Mariotta stick to the questions
asked ``and not go off on these tangents designed to evoke sympathy
from the jury.''
   Mariotta piped up: ``Your honor, I'm not an intellectual like
these people seem to think that I am. I am not. I am emotionally
upset because it took me 20 years to build this company and you
intellectuals robbed my company from me.''
   During the disjointed testimony Mariotta denied giving Wedtech
stock to Biaggi in exchange for the congressman's help in obtaining
no-bid government contracts.
   Four former Wedtech executives have pleaded guilty to state and
federal crimes ranging from bribery to fraud and testified for the
government in return for leniency. They and other witnesses have
said Mariotta helped create a multimillion-dollar company slush
fund for bribes, payoffs and off-the-books luxuries.
   Wedtech grew from a small machine shop into a $100 million
defense contractor through a Small Business Administration program
that awarded government contracts to minority-owned businesses
without competitive bidding.
   Prosecutors charge that Mariotta concealed from the SBA that he
no longer controlled the company. But Mariotta insisted he was the
dupe of greedy men who later forced him out.
   In 1984 Reagan lauded Wedtech for its hiring of rehabilitated
drug addicts, ex-convicts and former welfare recipients.
   In 1986, after Mariotta was forced out, the Bronx company shut
its doors and filed for bankruptcy.

   A secretary accused of kidnapping a
newborn from a hospital had told her boss she was pregnant, took a
maternity leave and then brought a baby to work to show it off, her
employer says.
   Employees put up an ``It's A Girl!'' banner, congratulated Linda
Lou German and held the baby during the office visit Wednesday.
   German, 26, of Wheelersburg, Ohio, was sent to a federal
penitentiary in Lexington, Ky. for psychiatric tests Thursday
following the safe return of three-day-old Lindsey Manns. The woman
was charged with kidnapping.
   It was ``just a case of desperately wanting a baby,'' said FBI
agent Roger Nicely.
   The infant was swiped from a maternity ward crib at Cabell
Huntington Hospital on Tuesday by a woman in a nurse's uniform.
   The baby was reunited with her parents, Linda and Donald Manns
of Harts Creek, early Thursday after German returned the child to
the hospital in good health.
   ``It's just an answer to our prayers to the Lord that got her
back for us,'' said Manns, 23, a coal truck driver.
   ``It was just the happiest time of my life to see my baby
again,'' said Mrs. Manns.
   German's relatives called a special hospital hotline Wednesday
night and German followed with her own call, telling FBI agents her
relatives did not believe the infant was her own, authorities said.
   ``She wanted to come in with the baby to prove to her mother and
her stepfather it was her baby,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Joseph Savage.
   German arrived at the hospital with the baby Wednesday night and
told FBI agents she had given birth in early July at a Lexington,
Ky., hospital, Savage said.
   A call to the hospital found no record of the birth, and a
doctor's exam concluded she had not given birth recently, Savage
said.
   German was taken into the room from which the infant was
abducted and ``began to cry and admitted she remembered taking a
baby, but was unable to remember what she did after she took the
baby or what hospital she took the baby from,'' FBI agent James
Kessler said in court papers.
   ``I realize now that this is not my baby,'' FBI agents quoted
German as saying.
   German worked at WUXA-TV in Portsmouth, Ohio, as office manager
and secretary to general manager Tom Watson. ``She looked pregnant
to me,'' he said. ``She came into the office yesterday with the
baby and showed it to the staff.''
   Watson said German, who joined the station in March, called July
6 to say she was taking maternity leave. German called the infant
Lauren Gray.
   ``We were shocked and very sad and my heart, our hearts, go out
to her,'' Watson said. ``She is a nice, softspoken person, and very
capable. Obviously, she thought it was her baby.''
   Watson said German, who has a 3{-year-old daughter, had a
history of miscarriages and might have lost her own baby. Savage
told a U.S. magistrate he believed German had faked her pregnancy
since December.
   The federal kidnapping charge carries a maximum life sentence.
   He said German was believed to have been involved in an
attempted abduction of another baby born at the same hospital.
   In that case, a Marrowbone Creek woman told police that after
she gave birth, a stranger visited her at home, brandished a knife
and threatened to take the baby before family members stepped in
and the woman fled.

<TEXT>
   Former mayor and ex-Klan leader James
R. Venable says he is appreciative but wants no part of the city's
effort to name a park for him on land he donated.
   City Council voted Tuesday to name a park for Venable, former
imperial wizard of the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, in a
move that came under criticism from the NAACP and the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
   ``I appreciate it,'' Venable said Wednesday, ``but I wouldn't
want any credit for it.''
   Robert Smith, one of the city's two black council members,
favored the move, saying Venable's past affiliation with the Klan
was ``not my concern.''
   ``I was born here and he was not the only one who did not like
blacks here,'' Smith said.
   Nickie Taylor, the receptionist at City Hall, said the phone
rang steadily Thursday. ``We've had people say they won't come into
our city now,'' she said.
   ``I think it's awful,'' said Coleman Seward, vice president of
the DeKalb County branch of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
   ``I'm not saying Venable shouldn't be honored in some way, but
not by a public park. I wouldn't go to a park with his name on
it,'' Seward said.
   Gloria Brown, head of a black civic organization here, did not
object. ``We all use the park; blacks on the Little League enjoy it
just like the whites. I think it's wonderful, regardless of his
views,'' she said.
   ``If he's generous enough to donate the land, I don't think it's
unusual that the park was named for him,'' said Ralph Shipp, a
black resident of Stone Mountain.
   Stewart Lewengrub, director of the Southeast region office of
the Anti-Defamation League, wrote Mayor Jane Rhodes, asking the
council to reverse its decision.
   ``The fact that Venable donated the land does not justify naming
the park for him,'' Lewengrub said in a statement. ``If Charles
Manson had donated the land, would they have named the park for
him?''

<HEAD>Conference Debates How Christianity Let Holocaust Happen</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 14 grafs to UPDATE with resumption of conference,
remarks from Reagan, Kohl; picks up 10th pvs: This crime...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clergymen, scholars and survivors of the Holocaust
today applauded a message from West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
acknowledging his nation's responsibility for the Nazi genocide.
   ``Germans became guilty of that crime as individuals, but they
are collectively liable for the injustice committed in their
name,'' said Kohl's message, read to 500 people attending
``Remembering for the Future,'' a conference on the Holocaust and
its impact on modern generations.
   Kohl joined President Reagan, British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, French President Francois Mitterrand, Israeli President
Chaim Herzog and European Economic Community head Jacques Delors in
sending messages to the conference on its final day.
   The West German leader's words were read by Robert Maxwell, the
Czech-born Jewish publisher who sponsored the weeklong conference.
Maxwell lauded West Germany's willingness to face its past, and at
his request, Kohl was given a round of applause.
   ``No one can rule out the possibility of comparable atrocities
happening again,'' said Kohl's message. ``It must not be forgotten.
It is an appeal to each one of us to examine our own thoughts over
and over again.''
   It said: ``We Germans are prepared to live with this terrible
truth.''
   Reagan's message said the world ``can never have reminders
enough about the tragedy that results when nations abandon their
reverence for the sanctity of every human life.''
   More than 500 scholars, concentration camp survivors,
theologians, artists and teachers met here to examine how
Christianity could have allowed the Holocaust to happen.
   ``The words `never again' must ever be the pledge of all who
pause in remembrance of those who have perished and of all who
cherish mankind's deepest hopes and ideals,'' Reagan said in his
message.
   The conference, which began in Oxford a week ago, concludes with
leaders of Christian churches joining in prayers for the 6 million
Jewish victims of Nazi Germany's genocide during World War II.
   Boston University professor Elie Wiesel, a Nobel prize-winning
author and survivor of the Buchenwald concentration camp where
10,000 people died daily, said that after a lifetime of studying
and writing about the Holocaust, he still could not understand how
it happened.
   ``Often I think of the children walking slowly, quietly,
obediently, to the flames or to the mass graves, and I am almost
grateful for the pain that links my memory to theirs,'' he said in
a keynote address.
   The conference ranked among the biggest of its kind held outside
the United States, where there has been an expansion in academic
studies of the Holocaust.
   Maxwell, 65, lost most of his family at the hands of the Nazis
in World War II.
   ``This crime, this disaster, has been examined mainly in the
United States,'' Maxwell said Thursday. ``Yet it was in Europe that
it happened.''
   Maxwell's wife Elisabeth, a French Protestant, was the main
organizer of the conference. As a child she lived in a largely
Jewish district of Paris from which most her friends vanished as
the Nazis rounded up the Jews.
   She has long believed that Christianity contained a strong
streak of anti-Semitism.
   The Jewish Chronicle, Britain's top Jewish newspaper, has
predicted that the conference ``could radically affect the way
British people and institutions think'' about the Holocaust.
   Herzog, in his message, said he hoped the meeting would ``help
to shape a future in which the horror will never be forgotten.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said it was important for generations who did not
live through ``those agonized years'' to learn how and why it
happened.
   ``That knowledge will help people everywhere who are determined
that nothing like this shall ever happen again,'' she added in her
message to the conference.
   Organizers timed the meeting just before next week's Lambeth
conference, an international gathering of Anglican bishops. Mrs.
Maxwell said the archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Robert
Runcie, pledged that the prelates will discuss the outcome of
``Remembering for the Future.''
   Leading participants included American academic specialists on
Jewish-Chr, A. Roy Eckardt and his wife, Alice L.
Eckardt; Holocaust historian Yehuda Bauer and the Rev. Franklin
Littell, an American Methodist minister who helped pioneer
Holocaust studies in the United States.
   In associated events, organizistian relationsers have arranged a London
exhibition of drawings produced by Jews in concentration camps and
a concert at the Royal Opera House featuring works by composers
Dmitri Shostakovich, Benjamin Britten and Gustav Mahler.

<HEAD>Nevada High Court OKs Use Of Some Police Decoys To Catch Thieves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nevada's Supreme Court, which banned
use of police decoys who pose as drunks with cash hanging from
their pockets, says it's OK if the decoy is alert, well-dressed and
more of a ``logical target'' for thieves.
   The high court Thursday rejected an appeal from Vincent
DePasquale, convicted in Las Vegas of larceny after a police decoy
operation in 1983.
   A plainclothes policewoman was used as a decoy, carrying a
shoulder bag in which a fake $100 bill was exposed, a zipper pulled
tight against the money. DePasquale claimed entrapment.
   The Supreme Court said it has ruled against use of decoys when
they pose as anyone who is helpless, drunk or feigning
unconsciousness with money exposed temptingly from pockets.
   That ``degree of vulnerability'' suggested entrapment, or
inducing someone to commit a crime he might not otherwise commit,
the court said.
   In the DePasquale case, however, ``the exposed valuables were
presented in a realistic situation, an alert and well-dressed woman
walking on the open sidewalks in the casino area,'' the court said.
   ``The fact that the money was exposed simply presented a
generally identified social predator with a logical target,'' the
court added. ``These facts suggest that DePasquale was predisposed
to commit this crime.''

<TEXT>
   A Secret Service agent has been indicted on
charges of beating and falsely arresting a lawyer who crossed paths
with a presidential candidate's motorcade while walking to his
apartment.
   Kevin Schatzle, 27, of Princeton, N.J., was charged Thursday
with two civil rights violations, each punishable by up to a year
in jail and $100,000 in fines.
   Richard Ward, agent in charge of the Secret Service's New York
office, said he couldn't recall any previous case in which an agent
was indicted for on-duty actions.
   The five-year veteran of the agency has been on sick leave
because of injuries sustained during the arrest April 10, said Ward.
   Schatzle was accused of kicking and punching Christopher
Gorayeb, 31, and then falsely arresting him near the motorcade of
Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn. The agent was part of the security detail
for Gore, who was then campaigning for the Democratic nomination in
the New York primary.
   Schatzle told passers-by who complained about his actions that
the lawyer had spit at him. Gorayeb claimed the agent attacked him
when he yelled an obscenity at the motorcade because one of its
cars almost struck him as he crossed the street.
   A witness videotaped the confrontation and presented the
evidence to authorities.
   Gorayeb, who specializes in personal injury cases, said he
suffered a broken nose and eye, neck and shoulder injuries.

<HEAD>34 Killed When Bus Hits Landmine In Northern Ethiopia</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: RESTORES dropped word in last graf.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A passenger bus traveling through
the war-torn northern provinces ran over a land mine and triggered
an explosion that killed 34 people and injured 39, the state-run
news agency said.
   The Ethiopian News Agency said the blast occurred Thursday 55
miles south of the Eritrean capital Asmara along the Asmara-Mekelle
highway, one of Ethiopia's main northern arteries for trade and
relief aid. Government soldiers have been fighting two separate
rebellions in the northern provinces.
   The news agency said the bus was destroyed and described the
accident scene as ``gruesome and horrifying.''
   The bus was carrying people back to their homes in Eritrea's
southern neighbor, Tigre, which the government claims it has
recaptured from Tigre People's Liberation Front rebels who overran
the province earlier this year.
   In Eritrea, the government has not reported any engagements with
the secessionist Eritrean People's Liberation Front since May and
June when the rebels tried to capture Keren, the province's second
largest city.
   The front has been fighting the Addis Ababa government for 27
years, while the Tigrean rebels took up arms in 1974.
   Ethiopia has restricted movement in and out of the north since
March, when it admitted for the first time to being at war with the
insurgencies.
   The government also ordered back to the capital about 60 foreign
aid workers who were helping feed drought victims in the north,
where Western relief officials estimated 3.2 million people were
threatened with famine.

   A helicopter ferrying workers from an
offshore oil rig made an emergency landing in the North Sea today,
and another helicopter rescued all 18 people who were aboard,
officials said.
   All the passengers and crew were safe, said officials at the
Norwegian Rescue Center at Sola Airport near this coastal oil
center.
   Rescue center spokesman Inge Kavle said a Super Puma helicopter
of the Norwegian Helicopter Service Company had to land in the
water about 80 miles southwest of Stavanger due to engine problems.
   ``It was a controlled emergency landing and no crash,'' Kavle
said.
   The 16 passengers and two crew members were picked up from
rubber dinghies by a Sea King helicpter from the same company.
   The Puma helicopter was on its way from the Ula oil rig when it
ran into trouble at 1:10 p.m.
   It was the second time in three days that a helicopter made an
emergency landing in the North Sea. On Wednesday, a helicopter
ditched east of Lerwick in the Shetland Islands. All 21 people on
board were rescued.

<HEAD>Shultz Says No Agreement With Chinese To Halt Middle East Missile
Sales</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George Shultz said today that
China made no promises to stop ballistic missiles sales to the
Middle East, but he said the United States should not stop the flow
of high technology to China in response.
   ``We didn't come to any agreements about it (missile sales), but
... I'm sure that the subject will continue to be an important one
on our agenda,'' Shultz told reporters after meeting with senior
leader Deng Xiaoping, Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang and Premier
Li Peng.
   When asked about news reports of a Chinese-Syrian missile deal,
Shultz said Chinese leaders told him their only ballistic missile
sales in the Middle East have been to Saudi Arabia.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that an agreement was
``consummated'' under which Beijing would sell intermediate-range
M-9 missiles to Syria.
   Senior U.S. administration officials traveling with Shultz have
said the Chinese are believed to be marketing the weapons, which
have a maximum range of about 370 miles, but that U.S. officials
have no indications of a sale.
   The officials say the M-9, which is potentially capable of
striking targets in Israel from Syria, is at least nine months away
from production.
   More than 100 U.S. congressmen sent Shultz a cable Thursday
warning that future transfer of U.S. high technology to China would
be ``jeopardized'' if the sale to Syria went through.
   Shultz said he got word of the cable only after his meetings
with top Chinese leaders, but added, ``I think the way to try to
get at it with the Chinese is other kinds of constructive ways.''
   Angry over alleged Chinese sales of anti-ship Silkworm missiles
to Iran, Washington last fall temporarily froze some high
technology sales to China. The United States has also been critical
of Beijing's sale this spring of intermediate range CSS-2, or East
Wind, missiles to Saudi Arabia.
   In his meeting with Shultz today, Deng said the United States
and China should bring their relationship to a ``higher plane.''
   The 84-year-old senior leader said relations between the United
States and China have improved steadily during President Reagan's
term although ``of course there are still some problems between
us.''
   Shultz held closed-door talks with Li and Zhao. It was his
second day in Beijing. On Saturday he flies to Seoul, South Korea,
the seventh stop on a nine-country trip through Asia and the
Pacific.
   Discussions here focused largely on missile sales and the Khmer
Rouge, the Chinese-backed Cambodian guerrillas who some fear may
muscle their way back into power if Vietnam pulls its troops out of
Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge massacred hundreds of thousands of Cambodians
after it took power in 1975. Vietnam ousted them when it invaded in
1978.
   Shultz said the United States and China have ``a very broad
agreement as to certain aspects of that situation,'' including
``rather similar views'' on stopping a Khmer Rouge return to power.
China officially supports a three-party Cambodian opposition
coalition that includes the Khmer Rouge.
   U.S. sources said Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told Shultz on
Thursday that senior Khmer Rouge leaders may retire.
   Shultz said both countries are pressing for a total withdrawal
of Vietnamese troops and both view non-Communist Prince Norodom
Sihanouk as the central figure in a future Cambodian government.
Sihanouk abruptly resigned this week as head of the anti-Vietnamese
coalition.
   Sihanouk and several others proposed a peacekeeping force to
ensure a cease-fire, the peaceful formation of a government and
free elections in Cambodia.
   Vietnam pledged to remove all its troops, currently estimated at
120,000 by U.S. sources, by 1990. This has sparked fears that the
Khmer Rouge would shoulder aside their two, less powerful
non-communist allies in the anti-Vietnamese coalition and seize
power once Hanoi's forces have left.

   Vietnam has confirmed it will attend
peace talks on Cambodia this month, official Vietnamese radio said
today.
   There had been doubts that Vietnam would participate in the
talks scheduled for July 25 in Bogor, Indonesia. The talks will be
the first among all the warring parties.
   Vietnam had accused the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
of trying to turn the talks into direct negotiations between
Vietnam and guerrilla groups fighting its occupation of Cambodia.
   Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, said Tuesday his
country would attend only if ASEAN confirmed it didn't change the
rules of the informal talks.
   Voice of Vietnam radio said Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Ali
Alatas, acting on behalf of ASEAN, asked Vietnam's ambassador to
Jakarta to convey to Thach assurances that ASEAN would respect
rules agreed upon in a July 29, 1987 communique signed by Vietnam
and Indonesia.
   The meeting between Alatas and the Vietnamese ambassador, Tran
Huy Chuong, took place in Jakarta on Tuesday, said the broadcast.
The report was monitored in Bangkok.
   The broadcast said Alatas gave assurances that ``the ASEAN
countries respect the joint Vietnam-Indonesia communique ... and
that ASEAN countries have no intention to turn this meeting into a
talk between Vietnam and the Kampuchean (Cambodian) factions.''
   Vietnam wants the talks held in two stages, with the Cambodians
discussing ``internal problems'' in the first stage and Vietnam
joining in a second stage to discuss ``international aspects'' of
the conflict.
   The three guerrilla groups and the Vietnamese-installed People's
Republic of Kampuchea are to attend the first stage. Vietnam, its
close communist ally Laos, and ASEAN countries are to attend the
second stage.
   The guerrillas are grouped in a coalition and include the
communist Khmer Rouge and the non-communist forces of former
Cambodian leaders Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Son Sann.

<HEAD>Drugs Were Delivered To Plutonium Building, Report Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Drug deals were made in a restricted
plutonium building at the Lawrence Livermore nuclear weapons
laboratory in 1986, the lab director disclosed.
   John Nuckolls made the disclosure to the University of
California Regents in a report Thursday on an undercover drug probe
dubbed Operation Snowstorm at the facility.
   The university operates Livermore and two other weapons
laboratories under a contract with the government. Livermore, near
San Francisco, conducts highly sensitive research on the ``Star
Wars'' missile defense system.
   As a result of the undercover operation, four contract workers
and two lab employees were arrested on drug charges and
successfully prosecuted, Nuckolls said.
   The total drug purchases amounted to less than $1,000. Nuckolls
said small amounts of methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana were
purchased both on and off the laboratory site during the 1986 probe.
   Two of the individuals prosecuted had what the lab director
termed ``Q-clearances'' giving them access to certain top-secret
buildings and materials.
   One of those with top security clearance made drug deliveries in
the super-sensitive plutonium building, Nuckolls said.
   Lab management and Energy Department officials have been under
criticism, accused of terminating the investigation prematurely.
   ``The laboratory's security investigators and the undercover
officer strongly opposed the decision to terminate'' the probe in
September 1986, Nuckolls said.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which participated in
the investigation, also opposed the decision, said Nuckolls, who
was appointed director in April.
   Energy Undersecretary Joseph F. Salgado told a House
investigative subcommittee last month that officials decided to
terminate the investigation ``because it had run for eight months
and was apparently not uncovering new productive leads.''
   He said the operation had served its purpose in putting
Livermore employees on notice that drug use would not be tolerated.
   In addition to the six workers prosecuted, 10 others, including
five with Q-clearances, resigned when confronted with evidence of
illegal drug activities, Nuckolls said.
   Nuckolls said allegations also were gathered on 36 additional
workers, but an internal review found insufficient information to
warrant disciplinary action.
   The lab director said two follow-up reviews concluded that
Operation Snowstorm was conducted professionally and competently.
Nuckolls acknowledged that a review by Congress was sharply
critical.
   The House subcommittee has asked the General Accounting Office
to review how effectively the lab controls government property,
including classified documents, high explosives and nuclear
material.

   Homeless people and their advocates occupied houses, pitched
tent cities and marched through streets demanding ``Housing Now''
as they sought to rally support across the nation. At least 78
people were arrested.
   ``We've made a strong statement that homeless people are going
to get off their knees and fight for their rights,'' said Brian
Flagg, head of the Southern Arizona Coalition for the Homeless,
minutes before he and 10 others were arrested Thursday while
occupying a vacant townhouse in Tucson, Ariz.
   Voter registration drives also were a part of Homeless Action
Day, a protest that organizers said involved at least 60 cities
nationwide.
   ``I'm not really all that far out of the mud, but I can still
see a little bit better than some of these people,'' said Ronald
Dized, a Nashville, Tenn., construction worker who said he used to
be homeless. ``I'd be less than I am if I didn't support this. I've
been through it; I know what it's like to want a home.''
   In Boston, two policemen and a demonstrator were injured in a
fight that erupted after demonstrators tried to occupy a boarded-up
Boston Redevelopment Authority building.
   Some of the 75 people who marched on behalf of the homeless used
crowbars to pry boards off the building, and when police tried to
stop them, they swung the boards at the officers, police spokesman
Thomas F. Santry said.
   Eighteen people were arrested, including one who was charged
with disorderly conduct and possession of a dangerous weapon. Three
others were charged with assault and battery on a police officer.
   Thirty-seven people were arrested when they blocked traffic near
the Capitol in Washington, D.C., including Mitch Snyder, leader of
the Community for Creative Non-Violence, which organized the
protests.
   Later Thursday, Wayne Vorhees, a volunteer with Snyder's group,
climbed a 767-foot broadcast tower in Washington, unfurling a
banner reading ``Housing Now'' and vowing to remain until the
government expands housing opportunities for the poor. Two
companions were arrested and charged with unlawful entry. Vorhees
was coaxed down by police early today and charged with the same
offense.
   Seven people were arrested on trespass charges in St.
Petersburg, Fla., during an attempt to clean and convert a
boarded-up, city-owned house into a shelter for women and children.
Some 100 people had gathered at one of more than 400 houses
purchased by the city on property to be donated to the University
of South Florida.
   Three people were arrested in Columbus, Ohio, on criminal
trespassing charges after an unsuccessful attempt by about 20
homeless people and activists to take over an abandoned building,
police said.
   Speakers at a rally outside The Omni in Atlanta, site of the
Democratic National Convention, said federal support for the
homeless has waned during the Reagan administration, but they said
Democrats share the blame.
   ``Though it's easy to blame the Republicans, the Democrats are
just as responsible for the situation that exists,'' said Keith
Summa of the National Coalition for the Homeless in Atlanta.
   In Philadelphia, the homeless occupied 13 empty government-owned
homes, demanding ownership of the houses and federal money to
rehabilitate them.
   Fifty homeless people and supporters in Nashville, Tenn.,
marched in 90-degree weather, carrying signs bearing such messages
as ``Street people are people.''
   New Jersey's homeless joined their counterparts nationwide by
erecting tent cities and filing a lawsuit against Newark's Housing
Authority, accusing it of demolishing low-income units without
replacing them, contrary to federal law.
   About 100 people demonstrated at Newark City Hall in support of
the class-action lawsuit filed Thursday in state Superior Court,
said David S. Burgess, a leader of the Newark Coalition for
Low-Income Housing.
   Housing Authority Executive Director Milton Buck denied Burgess'
charges and said the authority would fight the lawsuit.
   In Albuquerque, N.M., seven homeless people and 45 supporters
rallied at a park Thursday night, then marched two blocks carrying
signs such as ``Homeless, not helpless,'' and occupied an abandoned
city-owned house. There were no arrests.

<HEAD>Iran Plans New Oil Platform in Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRI TAYLOR</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran is building a new oil
platform in the Persian Gulf, and sophisticated equipment being
installed behind its armor plating could spell more trouble for
shipping, shipping executives said today.
   The platform will have landing pads big enough to handle two
large helicopters and one small one at the same time, the
executives said. It also is being reinforced with steel plating,
they said.
   The executives, who spoke on condition on anonymity, quoted
Iranian officials as saying the platform will become a base for
Iran's fleet of oil shuttle tankers serving the Larak Island export
terminal in the Strait of Hormuz.
   But some shipping industry experts say it also could be intended
for military purposes, including the electronic monitoring of
shipping traffic and warships traveling through the strait, where
some Iranian attacks on neutral shipping occur.
   Iran used drilling rigs as military communications bases in the
past, according to U.S. officials. Three have been destroyed or
damaged in attacks by American warships _ one in October and two
more on April 18.
   The attacks in each case were in retaliation for Iranian
military actions against American-related ships and aircraft in the
gulf, U.S. officials said.
   ABC television reported that the new triangular-shaped rig will
be capable of ``coordinating sea and airborne attacks upon the U.S.
Navy'' and refueling helicopter gunships and patrol boats.
   The shipping executives said the facilities, including cabins
for about 200 workers, should be completed in 45 days.
   Some shipping industry officials expressed skepticism that the
platform was for military use.
   ``The term armor-plated is exaggerated. They are reinforcing it
with steel, but they are not turning it into a tank,'' said one. He
added that the Iranians probably would arm it with anti-aircraft
guns, as they have other oil platforms in the gulf.
   Foreign tankers pick up oil cargoes brought to Larak Island from
Kharg Island, in the northern gulf, by Iran's fleet of state-owned
and chartered tankers.
   Despite being nearly 1,000 miles from Iraqi bases, Iraq raided
Larak several times. Its most recent attack was May 14, when
warplanes wrecked a Spanish tanker and damaged four others,
including two huge ships used to store and transfer oil to other
tankers.

   The last Volkswagen made in North
America has rolled off the assembly line, but it's not for sale.
   ``The car will remain with the company. It will be a permanent
fixture at Volkswagen,'' said Thomas McDonald, spokesman for
Volkswagen of America Inc., the West German automaker's U.S.
subsidiary.
   The white, two-door 1989 Golf model was completed Thursday
afternoon at the plant, the first foreign-owned automobile assembly
plant in the United States.
   Its final resting place has yet to be determined, McDonald said,
but officials are considering a corporate museum in Wolfsburg, West
Germany, which has about 100 cars.
   There was no fanfare as the car, the 1,197,411th vehicle built
at the plant, rolled off the production line. Photographers and TV
cameras were not allowed to record the event.
   The plant, which produced its first car in 1978, is about 35
miles southeast of Pittsburgh.
   Dogged by faltering sales of its American-built cars, Volkswagen
announced in November it would cut its losses by serving the U.S.
market with vehicles built in West Germany, Mexico and Brazil.
   About 2,500 people eventually will lose their jobs because of
the shutdown.

   Wholesale prices one step short of retail rose
a moderate 0.4 percent in June, the government said today. But the
drought searing much of the nation sent prices for raw food soaring
at their steepest pace in more than 2{ years.
   The Labor Department said raw costs jumped 4.2 percent last
month, a rate not seen since the 5.1 percent climb of October 1985.
Further along in the wholesale process, however, prices for foods
ready to be retailed rose 1.1 percent, reflecting earlier, though
less severe, increases in raw food costs.
   Some examples of price increases at the unprocessed-food level:
   _Wheat, 25.3 percent.
   _Corn, 24.3 percent.
   _Turkeys, 22.8 percent.
   _Soybeans 22.0 percent.
   _Chickens, 22.5 percent.
   Reflecting the fact that many farmers are slaughtering animals
they cannot afford or find feed for, cattle prices fell 5.2 percent
while hog prices were down 4.0 percent.
   The news was not quite so severe at the finished-goods level.
Prices for eggs rose 16.0 percent while turkey prices gained 9.3
percent, chicken prices jumped 7.3 percent and fresh fruit costs
gained 6.7 percent.
   Those gains were partially offset by a 5.7 percent decline in
vegetable prices and a 2.2 percent decrease for rice.
   Stacy Kottman, an economist at Georgia State University, said
that prices of foods made from grain, such a vegetable oils, bakery
products and pasta, likely will continue to rise, and that the drop
in vegetable prices won't last. Meat prices should continue to fall
through late autumn, but will then head higher after the
drought-induced slaughtering tails off, he said.
   ``Next year we'll probably see the full impact of the drought,
particularly if it persists. Up until this week we could say,
`Well, if we get some rain, we'll probably be all right.' But this
week is the last week we can say that,'' he said.
   Energy prices, meanwhile, fell at the finished level by 1.6
percent. Leading the way was a drop of 7.1 percent for fuel oil
while declines of 2.4 percent and 1.0 percent were posted for
gasoline and natural gas respectively.
   Further energy price declines are considered likely because
crude oil prices have fallen over the last month to their lowest
levels in nearly two years.
   ``We can just thank our fortunes that OPEC can't get together on
restraint of production. I hate to think what the report would look
like if oil prices were rising,'' Kottman said.
   In other economic news:
   _The Commerce Department said the U.S. trade deficit rose
slightly in May to $10.9 billion, but the imbalance was still the
second smallest in almost three years. The gap between imports and
exports widened by $627 million from a revised April imbalance of
$10.3 billion.
   _The Federal Reserve Board said production at the nation's
factories, mines and utilities rose a moderate 0.4 percent in June,
the ninth consecutive month without a decline. The June increase,
boosted by an increase in electricity use during the heat wave,
pushed industrial output 5.8 percent higher than it was a year ago.
   _Business inventories in May rose a moderate 0.6 percent to
$728.4 billion, held in check by a 0.9 percent jump in sales to
$483.7 billion, the Commerce Department said.
   Overall, if the June increase in wholesale finished goods prices
held for 12 straight months, the inflation rate would be 4.6
percent annually, more than double the 2.2 percent rise of 1987.
   Subtracting the effects of volatile food and energy prices,
wholesale prices rose 0.3 percent last month.
   Analysts consider this rate a better indication of the economy's
underlying inflation. Even with steep food price gains anticipated
for the several months, many economists feel the effect of those
gains will be only temporary.
   For the first half of 1988, prices one step short of retail rose
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.6 percent. Excluding food
and energy prices, wholesale costs rose 4.0 over that period.
   Prices from March through June have risen at a monthly rate of
either 0.4 percent or 0.5 percent.
   At the finished level, the department gave these other price
changes:
   _Passenger car prices, up 1.0 percent.
   _Women's clothing, up 1.0 percent.
   _Home electronic equipment, down 2.2 percent.
   _Cosmetics, down 0.6 percent.
   The June increase brought the wholesale price index for finished
goods to 107.9, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods
costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $107.90 last month, 40 cents
more than in May.
   This calculation is not adjusted for seasonal variations, as are
other calculations in the report.
   The Consumer Price Index, which tracks services and imported
goods not included in the wholesale price report, has risen at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.4 percent over the first five
months of the year, the same rate as for all of 19878.
   Consumer price figures for June will be released next week.

   A two-engine plane crashed in a jungle
in southern Venezuela and killed 10 of the 11 people on board,
authorities said today. A 5-year-old boy survived, they said.
   The boy, Remy Revilla, suffered serious burns and was
hospitalized in critical condition in Ciudad Bolivar, civil
aeronautics officials said. Ciudad Bolivar is 280 miles east of the
capital, Caracas.
   The boy's father was killed in the crash Thursday, the officials
said.
   Rescue patrols sent to the area said most of the bodies were
burned beyond recognition.
   The plane took off before noon from Ciudad Bolivar and was
headed to Icabaru, near the Brazilian border. Most of the
passengers, including four musicians, were to attend a party in
Icabaru.
   A few minutes after takeoff, the pilot reported failure in one
of the engines.
   ``Nothing was heard since from the pilot,'' a civil aeronautics
official said.

   Doctors who divided a donated liver and
transplanted it into two babies say the operation demonstrated the
procedure is ``technically feasible'' even though one infant died.
   Twelve-week-old Joseph Kovach of Geneva, Ill., who at 4.2 pounds
was the smallest human ever to receive a transplant, died of heart
failure Thursday at Wyler Children's Hospital at the University of
Chicago Medical Center.
   The second infant, 7-month-old Jaclyn Manrose of Crystal Lake,
was doing well three days after the operation, said Jill Goldmann,
a hospital spokeswoman. The child was listed in critical and stable
condition.
   The children were participants Tuesday in the first double liver
transplant in the United States, receiving the divided liver of a
1-year-old who died in an accident, the university said.
   The boy's heart had stopped briefly after the liver transplant
and he later suffered kidney and lung failure, said a hospital
spokesman, John Easton.
   Doctors had regarded the operation as a longshot for the boy but
his only hope of survival, said Dr. Peter F. Whitington. The boy
previously had undergone open-heart surgery to correct a birth
defect.
   Joseph suffered from cirrhosis, a type of liver damage, that
existed at birth from an unknown cause. Jacyln had a hereditary
defect called alpha-1--antitrypsin deficiency that can lead to
hepatitis or cirrhosis.
   Double liver transplants have been performed in Europe,
involving adult donors, Easton said.

<TEXT>
   Authorities in Azerbaijan are preventing vehicles
carrying foodstuffs from reaching a breakaway region of their
republic and have imposed an economic blockade on the mostly
Armenian area, a local journalist said today.
   The official Tass news agency blamed the supply problems on a
strike in the disputed region, Nagorno-Karabakh. It said more than
130 railway cars loaded with supplies were sitting at the train
station in Stepenakert, the region's main city. More than 300
containers with foodstuffs have not been unloaded, Tass said.
   The journalist from the state broadcasting authority said an
airliner was forced to turn back to neighboring Armenia on Thursday
after Azerbaijani authorities refused to let it land in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   ``There are no more fruits or vegetables in our shops,'' the
journalist said in a telephone interview from Stepanakert. ``We
have almost no economic ties now with Azerbaijan.''
   The legislature of Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave the size of
Delaware whose 160,000 inhabitants are mostly Armenian, voted
Tuesday to secede and join Armenia. The Azerbaijani government
called the vote illegal and declared it void.
   ``We are under a virtual economic blockade,'' said the
journalist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The Azerbaijanis
are trying to morally kill our movement, to strike down our just
demands.''
   For the past two months, Nagorno-Karabakh has been disrupted by
strikes by ethnic Armenians who want to be united with the Armenian
republic. Armenia followed suit with strikes on July 4 demanding
the annexation.
   The official Tass news agency reported that the situation in
Stepanakert remained tense. A general strike in the city continued.
   The journalist said none of the city's 20 factories was working
and that bus service between Stepanakert and the Armenian cities of
Kirovakan and Kafan was suspended.
   Buses to Yerevan, however, were setting out every other day with
an escort of police brought in from the Stavropol region of
southern Russia, he said.
   On Thursday, an Aeroflot airliner en route from Yerevan to
Stepanakert was forced to turn back after Azerbaijani authorities
refused to let it land in Stepanakert, the journalist said. The
airliner touched down in the Armenian city of Goris, and passengers
returned to Yerevan by bus, he said.
   The journalist said ``several thousand'' troops were patrolling
Nagorno-Karabakh today but that the area was quiet.
   A resident of Stepanakert said Thursday the ethnic dispute had
taken a heavy toll. ``Our situation is very bad because the strike
is continuing. No one is working,'' said the woman, who hung up the
phone before giving her name.
   She said Nagorno-Karabakh residents had to rely on food produced
locally. ``We aren't receiving food from Azerbaijan or Armenia,''
she said, but ``we get some potatoes from the Stepanakert area.''
   Activists said more than 150,000 people held a rally Thursday in
Yerevan urging Armenia's 10 deputies to the Soviet parliament to
press for annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   About three-fourths of the enclave's residents are ethnic
Armenians, most of them Christians, but the region was assigned to
predominately Moslem Azerbaijan in 1923.
   Armenians believe the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the
highest legislative body in the Soviet government, will meet Monday
to consider the Nagorno-Karabakh question.
   In Moscow on Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P.
Perfilyev said such a meeting was likely but that he didn't know
when it would occur.
   Khovik Vasilyan, an Armenian activist, said by telephone from
Yerevan today that most of the Armenian capital's factories were
still strikebound but that transport was functioning normally in
the city of 1.1 million people.
   He said another rally in Yerevan to press Armenian demands for
annexation was planned Saturday.
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, said Thursday the work
stoppage in Armenia had cost $65 million in lost production and
that $29 million worth of construction had not been completed.
   Thirty-two people were killed in ethnic riots in February at
Sumgait, Azerbaijan, 26 of them Armenians.
   Tass said that about 20,000 Azerbajanis living in Armenia had
fled to Azerbaijan and that as of Wednesday, 7,265 Armenians who
once lived in Sumgait and other Azerbaijan cities had returned to
Armenia.

<HEAD>Official: U.S. Will Operate Canal Whether Panama Helps Or Not</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States will carry out its
responsibility of operating the Panama Canal ``with or without the
participation of Panama,'' says the chairman of the board of the
Panama Canal Commission.
   The four Panamanian members of the nine-member bi-national board
boycotted the panel's quarterly two-day meeting, which concluded
Thursday in Savannah.
   ``The Panamanian government attempted to stop our meeting,''
chairman William Gianelli said.
   In response to the boycott, the U.S. board members voted
Wednesday not to hold any meetings in Panama until the political
unrest in that country settles down.
   The United States is seeking the ouster of Panamanian leader
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is under indictment on drug
charges in Florida.
   The board also approved a $500 million budget for the upcoming
year, a slight increase from the previous year, Gianelli said. The
budget now goes to the federal Office of Management and Budget for
approval.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter said earlier this month
that Panamanian representatives will not attend any meetings of the
board until ``the United States normalizes relations with Panama''
and recognizes nominees of the Noriega government.
   The U.S. president appoints the board members, including the
Panamanians, who are nominated by the Panamanian government.
   Noriega also was upset when the canal board canceled a meeting
scheduled for last April in Panama, Gianelli said.
   Gianelli said Panama's boycott of the meetings and the country's
interference in the operation of the canal are diminishing hopes
for a smooth transition to Panamanian ownership at the end of the
century.
   Panama is interfering by not allowing Panamanian canal
administrative staff members to attend the meeting and by
forbidding Panamanian staff to travel to the United States to learn
how to run the canal, Gianelli said.
   Panama has said it will not recognize any action taken by the
canal board members here.
   But Gianelli said any decisions taken by the board without the
votes of the Panamanian directors will be binding on the canal
operation because the commission is a U.S. government agency.

   Iranian gunboats struck a
Liberian-registered tanker in the Persian Gulf today and returned
twice more to attack it after the captain called for help from U.S.
warships, gulf-based shipping executives said.
   The U.S. missile frigate Robert G. Bradley responded to the
distress signal but did not confront the raiders, U.S. officials
said.
   The shipping executives identified the targeted vessel as the
85,989-ton Sea Victory, operated by the Piraeus, Greece-based
European Navigation Inc. They said the captain put out his distress
signal at about 2 p.m. and gave his location as five miles south of
Farsi island. The captain said the attack was carried out by two
Iranian gunboats.
   He was heard frantically shouting, ``American warship! Americans
warship!'' and within minutes he reported that the gunboats were
``returning to attack,'' said the executives who monitored the
radio calls.
   The captain was still shouting for help when the gunboats
returned a third time to raid the vessel, said the executives. They
said the attacks occurred within about 15 minutes.
   The attacks caused a fire, which the crew extinguished.
   In a radio telephone contact after the Iranians turned back, the
captain was overheard by monitors as saying the Iranians attacked
three times, and he described the condition of his ship as covered
with ``lots of holes.''
   He was overheard saying ``no casualties, thank God,'' but he
also said that his second officer suffered minor injuries.
   In Washington, the Pentagon said in a statement that the tanker
issued a call for help but was able to steam west under its own
power. When it reached international waters, it no longer required
assistance, the statement said.
   A U.S. Navy spokesman in the gulf, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the frigate Robert G. Bradley was on patrol in the
gulf more than 20 miles away and responded to the call and headed
toward the tanker.
   The Iranian gunboats did not pursue the tanker into
international waters, said the spokesman.
   The shipping executives, who also spoke on condition they not be
named, noted that the U.S. warship would not cross the 12-mile
territorial limit around Farsi, which would be Iranian waters.
   Under the existing rules of engagement for the Navy, vessels in
distress can be assisted only in international waters.
   Since May 3, the Navy rules of engagement have been expanded to
permit U.S. warships to intervene to stop attacks on neutral
shipping in international waters, if the ships under attack are not
carrying war-related materials and if they ask for assistance.
   It was the second raid by the Iranian gunboats in four days on a
tanker in the vicinity of Farsi, a stronghold for Iran's
paramilitary Revolutionary Guards.
   About 550 commercial vessels of different nationalities have
been caught in the tanker war. Iraq attacks ships sailing in
Iranian waters and Iran retaliates by raiding neutral shipping,
particularly vessels linked to Kuwait or Saudi Arabia.
   Iran accuses the two countries of aiding Iraq, its foe in the
nearly 8-year-old war.
   On Tuesday, the Iranian gunboats raided a Panamanian-registered
tanker, the 81,282-ton Universal Monarch, about 20 miles off Farsi,
setting its engine room ablaze and causing extensive flooding.
   The missile frigate Nicholas, on patrol in the area, had rushed
to the assistance of the vessel and two of its helicopters took
fire from the raiding gunboats. No casualties were reported.
   The raids on the Universal Monarch and the Sea Victory were
Iran's apparent retaliations for Iraqi strikes on two tankers _ the
Greek-owned Fellowship L and the Cypriot Star Ray _ a few days
earlier in the vicinity of Iran's vital Kharg Island oil terminal,
also in the northern part of the gulf.

   Dissident scriptwriters have filed a complaint
charging that the striking Writers Guild of America is unlawfully
preventing members from leaving the union and returning to work.
   The complaint filed Thursday by the Writers Coalition asks the
National Labor Relations Board to declare that the guild contract
illegally restricts a writer's ability to resign from it during a
strike.
   If the NLRB rules favorably, some writers may break ranks from
the guild and resume work, according to Writers Coalition spokesman
Lionel Chetwynd.
   Guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said the union will fight the
action. ``We are willing to take a case as far as necessary in the
legal system to have our rules declared legal and enforceable,''
she said.
   The WGA has been on strike against the Alliance of Motion
Picture and Television Producers since March 7 over creative
control and residual payments from reruns.
   The walkout by the 9,000 film and TV writers has resulted in
sweeping layoffs throughout the entertainment industry.
   The labor board will rule on the complaint within 30 days, said
Sidney Rosen, NLRB assistant regional director.
   Also Thursday, NBC announced that ``Magical World of Disney''
was the latest casualty of the strike. It will be pulled from the
fall schedule and replaced with a remake of ``The Hardy Boys,''
which ran on ABC in the late 1970s.

<HEAD>Court Sides With City In Dispute Over Convention Marches</HEAD>

   A federal appeals court today sided with the city
of Atlanta in a dispute with demonstrators who wanted to march on a
street adjacent to the Democratic National Convention site.
   Alternative '88, a coalition of protest groups planning to
demonstrate during the convention next week, went to court after
the city refused to allow parades on Marietta Street adjacent to
the convention site.
   U.S. District Judge Orinda Evans ruled last week that the city
has a significant government interest in guaranteeing delegates'
access to the convention and therefore was justified in barring
parades outside the Omni Hotel and the Georgia World Congress
Center.
   The coalition appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, arguing that ``if traffic problems can be a compelling
reason (for limiting demonstrations), then in fact the sidewalks
and streets are not held in trust for the use of the public.''
   The appeals court today upheld the lower court's ruling, noting
the city had given permission for demonstrators to march within one
block of the convention site.
   ``The visibility of the parade from the actual convention site
is not significantly diminished'' by holding it a block away, the
court said.

   Alderman Danny K. Davis has become the first
candidate to announce he will challenge acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer
in a special mayoral election prompted by the November death of
Harold Washington.
   Davis made the announcement Thursday, declaring the city ``on
the brink of disaster'' and ``leaderless.''
   Two other aldermen, Timothy Evans and Lawrence Bloom, have
indicated they also will challenge Sawyer for mayor. Other possible
candidates include Cook County State's Attorney Richard M. Daley
and U.S. Rep. William Lipinski.
   Sawyer was elected acting mayor by City Council shortly after
Washington's death from a heart attack. The special election Feb.
28 will choose someone to serve out the two years left in
Washington's term.
   Davis, 46, is a third-term alderman and Democratic committeeman
of his West Side ward.

   Former President Richard Nixon says if Michael
Dukakis can team up with someone as philosophically different from
him as Lloyd Bentsen, then George Bush should be able to patch up
any differences with Bob Dole.
   Nixon, in a memo to the Bush campaign, recommends Dole as a
running mate for Bush, the certain Republican nominee. However, the
former president also has kind words for Rep. Jack Kemp of New York
and California Gov. George Deukmejian, calling them ``strong
choices.''
   A copy of the note from the former president, who lives in
Saddle River, N.J., was made available to The Associated Press.
Nixon spokesman John Taylor confirmed Nixon wrote it for Bush's
``key strategists.''
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater said he received the memo late
Thursday.
   ``I'm reading it with great interest,'' Atwater said.
   ``If Dukakis and Bentsen _ with diametrically different views on
key issues _ can get together, Dole and Bush, who have no
significant philosophical differences, can get together, too,''
Nixon wrote, adding: ``Compared to the Democratic ticket, they
would look like Siamese twins.''
   Bush and Dole had some harsh exchanges back when they were
rivals for the Republican presidential nomination. But Nixon says
even if ``the pundits say'' Bush and Dole don't get along, the two
have a similar outlook and would make an effective team.
   By contrast, he wrote, differences between Dukakis, the governor
of Massachusetts, and Bentsen, the Texas senator, ``run to the
heart of virtually every major economic, social and foreign-policy
issue.''
   ``One is tall. The other is short,'' Nixon begins, ticking off
what he views as Dukakis-Bentsen differences. On such issues as tax
cuts, gun control and aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, the two are as
politically polarized as Dukakis and Bush, the former president
wrote.
   Nixon brushed aside comparisons between the Dukakis-Bentsen
ticket and the 1960 Massachusetts combination of John F. Kennedy
and Lyndon B. Johnson, which beat the ticket of Nixon and Henry
Cabot Lodge.
   ``They overlook a profound and obvious difference,'' Nixon said.
``Kennedy and Johnson were both mainstream Democrats.''
   He accused the Democrats of being ``willing to bury their
differences even if it means burying their principles'' in order to
have a shot at winning Texas, which he called ``the big enchilada.''
   Nixon described Bentsen as ``a mainstream Democrat'' but said
Dukakis ``definitely is not.''
   ``He is a card-carrying member of the McGovern-Mondale wing of
the Democratic Party,'' Nixon said of the Democratic nominee,
referring to former Vice President Walter Mondale and former Sen.
George McGovern of South Dakota, whom Nixon beat in 1972.
   The former president said the Dukakis camp was ``inept'' in
failing to reach Jackson and tell him of Bentsen's selection before
the word got out. But he said it will be in Jackson's own political
interests to stage a reconciliation with the Dukakis camp.
   In an aside, Nixon described Jackson as a ``fire-breathing
radical'' who has ``put on a three-piece suit and run for
president.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
leaders of the six other Warsaw Pact nations today began a two-day
summit expected to focus on disarmament and East-West dialogue.
   The meeting provided Gorbachev a showcase to inform his fellow
communist leaders in Eastern Europe on the latest developments in
Soviet ``perestroika,'' or restructuring.
   It was the first of the Warsaw Treaty Organization
political-consultative council since Gorbachev and President Reagan
held their summit in Moscow in early June.
   The leaders met in closed session and issued no information on
their deliberations. While they met, Gorbachev's wife, Raisa,
traveled to southern Poland to the former Nazi death camp at
Auschwitz-Birkenau and placed flowers there in memory of the 4
million people who died at the camp.
   The camp, about 140 miles southeast of Warsaw, was liberated by
the Soviet Red Army on Jan. 27, 1945.
   In June, Reagan and Gorbachev exchanged ratified copies of a
treaty to ban short- and intermediate-range nuclear weapons, most
of which are deployed in Europe.
   With the accord settled, attention has shifted to long-stalled
talks to reduce conventional forces in Europe. Gorbachev has
indicated that would be a top item on the Warsaw Pact leaders'
agenda.
   The pact meeting should ``point out the Warsaw Treaty's
priorities in disarmament,'' said a commentary Thursday in the
official Polish daily Zycie Warszawy.
   Conventional arms talks resume in Vienna this fall, and
Gorbachev suggested in Poland on Monday that informal talks be held
to search for a new starting point that could lead to progress.
   ``Poland and the U.S.S.R., as parties to the Warsaw Treaty,
attach special importance to the quickest possible inauguration of
negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and conventional
armaments in Europe,'' said a joint Polish-Soviet communique issued
Thursday.
   Both countries favor ``removing disproportions ... in this area
(and) are ready for a realistic and constructive dialogue,'' the
communique added.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization contends the East bloc
holds a dangerous 2-to-1 advantage in tanks, artillery and armored
personel carriers deployed near the borders separating East and
West Europe.
   In a speech to Parliament on Monday, the first day of his
six-day visit to Poland, Gorbachev proposed withdrawing an
unspecified number of ``analagous'' Warsaw Pact air forces if NATO
agreed not to deploy 72 U.S.-built F-16 fighter-jets in Italy.
   The Soviet Union has proposed that all armies leave foreign
territories across Europe by the year 2000.
   It was Warsaw's turn to host the annual session, held in the
stately Council of Ministers palace where the Warsaw Treaty was
signed in 1955.
   Five East bloc leaders arrived in Warsaw on Thursday, joining
Gorbachev and Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski. They are
Nicholae Ceaucescu of Romania, Milos Jakes of Czechoslovakia, Todor
Zhivkov of Bulgaria, Erich Honnecker of East Germany and newly
appointed Karoly Grosz of Hungary.
   The pact has been going through a period of ferment in recent
year, partially as a result of Gorbachev's reform policies and his
emphasis that each member country is free to choose its own path
toward restructuring.
   Poland and Hungary are enthusiastic backers of reform.
Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria take a cautious approach, while East
Germany shows only grudging interest in conducting similar reforms.
   Romania, where Ceaucescu continues to wield great centralized
control, is conspicuously out of step with the reform trend.

   A man claiming to be the ``No Joke
Bandit'' wanted in 35 bank holdups that netted $70,000 turned
himself in to police, the FBI said. The man told reporters a drug
habit drove him to steal.
   Russell Eugene Gadd, 25, walked into a police station Thursday
and identified himself as the man sought in the seven-month string
of robberies in which tellers were given notes saying, ``This is no
joke,'' said FBI spokesman Fred Reagan.
   Witnesses said the robber often reached for his waistband as if
he were armed, but no weapon was ever seen, Reagan said.
   Gadd said he turned himself in to ease pressure on his family
and friends by extensive news coverage of the robberies in southern
California, Reagan said.
   ``I had a bad drug habit and I just couldn't stop,'' Gadd told
KNBC-TV. ``I know I'm going to go to jail. I didn't want to keep
running, so I turned myself in.''
   If convicted, Gadd faces a maximum of 20 years in prison and a
$5,000 fine for each count.

   Nancy Weston, Braniff administrative assistant for maintenance,
said today the airline had no comment on the incident.
   A passenger, Lana Perkins, reported that the pilot came out of
the cockpit after other passengers reported fuel gushing from the
right wing about 15 minutes after takeoff late Thursday.
   ``Extinguish your cigarettes. Somebody forgot to put a cap on
the fuel tank. We've got to go back down,'' Mrs. Perkins quoted the
pilot as saying.
   ``People were angry. People were scared,'' added Mrs. Perkins,
32, of Fort Myers.

   A sailor convicted of
murdering and robbing a payroll officer aboard a U.S. destroyer was
spared the death penalty and given life imprisonment after
proclaiming his innocence.
   Petty Officer 1st Class Ruben Colon was sentenced Thursday by a
five-member court-martial panel. He was convicted Wednesday of
killing Lt. j.g. Ratish Prasad aboard the USS Hancock at dock here
March 15 and stealing $94,000 from the ship's safe.
   Colon, who had a 14-year military career as a Marine military
policeman and Navy electronic warfare technician, faced the death
penalty because he was found guilty of murder while committing a
robbery.
   The Navy has not executed one of its members since 1849.
   The sentence came after 34-year-old Colon, who did not testify
at his four-day court-martial, read a statement urging panel
members to reconsider the verdict.
   ``There was no one more surprised at your findings than
myself,'' Colon said. ``I was surprised for the simple fact that I
didn't do it.''
   Colon, of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, pointed out loose ends in the
investigation such as several other suspects who failed polygraph
examinations when questioned about the killing and theft.
   Colon was charged with taking more than $94,000 and 2,575 blank
U.S. Treasury checks. He was arrested April 12 after investigators
found more than $87,000 and the checks in a safe-deposit box rented
in his name.
   ``If you are all convinced Petty Officer Colon is the
perpetrator, death is not appropriate,'' defense attorney Lt.
Matthew Michels argued. ``Make Petty Officer Colon live with it the
rest of his natural life. Make him live with the horror and the
responsibility.''

   The U.S. trade deficit rose slightly in May to
$10.9 billion, but the imbalance was still the second smallest in
almost three years, the government said today. The good news sent
the dollar soaring on foreign currency markets.
   The Commerce Department reported that the gap between imports
and what America sells overseas widened by $627 million from a
revised April imbalance of $10.3 billion.
   The revised April trade deficit was the best showing since a
$9.9 billion deficit in August 1985, and the new figure for May is
the second best performance since that time.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the report
``represents good news in the continuing trend of reducing the
international trade deficit.''
   ``There is less deterioriation there than the markets had
expected, so the market reaction should be favorable,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Financial markets, which have been thrown into a tailspin by bad
trade figures over the past year, reacted favorably to the good
news. The dollar rose almost one cent against the British pound and
nearly one Japanese yen in London trading immediately after the
trade figures were reported.
   Jay Goldinger, an analyst with Capital Insight, a Los Angeles
investment firm, said the slight widening in the deficit for May
had been expected because the April number was held back by an
unusually low import figure. He predicted the trade deficit would
move into single digits in coming months as the country's trade
problem continues to show improvement after seven consecutive years
of steady deterioration.
   ``After the last few months of volatile movements, it was nice
to see only a small change,'' he said. ``We should have smooth
sailing for the rest of the year.''
   Imports did rise in May compared to April, climbing 3.4 percent
to $37.6 billion. But this increase was offset by a 2.3 percent
increase in U.S. exports, which rose to $26.6 billion, very close
to the record level for exports set in March.
   Analysts said the May trade figure was welcome news, proving
that sharp drops in the deficit in March and April were not flukes.
   The figures were also good news for the Reagan administration,
which is counting on strong export growth to propel the economy in
this presidential election year.
   For the first five months of the year, the U.S. trade deficit,
after adjusting for normal seasonal variations, has been running at
an annual rate of $140.7 billion, down substantially from the
record deficit of $170.3 billion run up last year.
   The improvement has come from a boom in export sales, which for
the first five months of this year are running a remarkable 30.4
percent above the same period in 1987. Imports were also up by 11.4
percent during the same period, reflecting in part price increases
caused by the decline in the value of the dollar over the past
three years.
   The administration in 1985 embarked on a coordinated strategy
with other major industrial countries of devaluing the dollar as a
way of curing the country's trade problems.
   A weak dollar makes American goods cheaper and thus more
competitive on overseas markets while making imports more expensive
for American consumers.
   The strategy took much longer than expected to show benefits,
but the administration is confident that the trade imbalance for
1988 will decline, marking the first annual improvement in eight
years.
   The increase in exports in May reflected a $0.3 billion rise in
agricultural shipments, a $0.3 billion advance in sales of capital
goods and a $0.1 billion rise in sales of American autos and parts
overseas.
   The rise in imports reflected increases of $1.1 billion in
industrial supplies and smaller rises in imports of capital goods.
Imports of autos fell by $0.6 billion during the month.
   Oil imports rose 17.7 percent during the month to $3.9 billion.
   By country, the biggest deficit, as usual, was with Japan, an
imbalance of $4.1 billion, down slightly from the April imbalance
of $4.4 billion.
   The substantial trade improvement has been a key factor in the
better-than-expected economic growth the country has enjoyed so far
this year. U.S. manufacturing has been enjoying boom times because
of a surge in export sales.
   The growth in manufacturing jobs helped to push the unemployment
rate down to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in June.
   Many economists believe almost half of the economy's growth this
year will come from an improving trade performance.
   David Wyss, senior financial economist for Data Resources Inc.,
said that he was not concerned that recent increases in the value
of the dollar would slow the long-term trend for an improving trade
deficit. He said he expects the dollar will resume its downward
progress in coming months.

   President Reagan today applauded overwhelming
House and Senate votes condemning Sandinista leaders for human
rights abuses and urged Congress to approve swiftly further aid for
Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, speaking for the
president, said Reagan ``is pleased with the overwhelming,
bipartisan votes'' on the issue.
   ``These votes send the message to the Sandinistas that the
United States is firmly committed to the achievement of freedom and
democracy in Nicaragua,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The Sandinistas' conduct makes clear that they will not
institute democratic reform and cease their threats to the security
of Central America unless effectively pressured and persuaded to do
so,'' the spokesman said.
   ``To achieve democracy in Nicaragua and security for all of
Central America clearly requires a viable and effective Nicaraguan
Democratic Resistance,'' he said.
   ``When the Congress returns, the president hopes they will move
swifly to enact legislation currently being formulated in the
Senate for further aid to the resistance,'' Fitzwater said.
   The House voted 385-18 on Thursday to condemn Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government for ``brutal suppression of basic
human rights.'' It urged the democracies of Central America to meet
to assess the situation.
   The House action followed closely on the 91-4 roll call by which
the Senate on Wednesday night adopted a stronger resolution warning
that military aid to the Contras could be approved if the
Sandinista government continues to frustrate democratic reforms and
does not end human rights abuses.
   Both resolutions condemn the Sandinistas for breaking up a
recent peaceful demonstration, jailing more than 40 people,
including opposition leaders, closing down the newspaper La Prensa
and the Catholic radio station and expelling U.S. Ambassador
Richard Melton and eight other American diplomats.
   Military aid was ended last February, but a $47.1 million aid
package containing $20 million for military purposes was introduced
late Wednesday in the Senate by Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   The White House on Thursday expressed support for the combined
humanitarian and military aid, which would last through next March.
   Under the measure, aid to the Contras would be authorized only
after the president certifies that it is necessary and after both
houses of Congress approve it.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday that the
White House was working with Congress on a new Contra aid bill and
said Dole has been ``very helpful'' in this effort.
   When Reagan was asked Wednesday whether he was supporting
efforts o get a new Contra aid package through Congress, he
responded, ``You bet I am.''
   Advocates of ending military assistance contended the step would
encourage the Sandinistas and Contras to negotiate seriously and to
cooperate in the Central American peace process fostered by Costa
Rican President Oscar Arias.
   American humanitarian assistance to the Contra forces has
continued.
   Until the Sandinista crackdown last weekend there had appeared
to be virtually no prospect that military aid to the Contras would
be restored.
   The House appeared divided on the issue on Thursday.
   ``I expect this body to take stronger action later,'' said Rep.
Robert J. Lagomarsino, R-Calif, echoing many of his colleagues.
   ``This resolution contains strong words; but it is just that _
strong words,'' he said. ``There are no teeth in this resolution.''
   But Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., also speaking for many of his
colleagues, said the United States should do nothing to fuel
further fighting in Central America.
   Bonior said that while it is important to ``condemn any
violations of the principle of democracy,'' he believes there is
still life in the peace process.
   ``The basis for progress, I believe, still remains,'' he said.
   In Senate testimony, Ambassador Melton said he believes
congressional resolutions do little to sway the Sandinistas.
   Melton said he does think ``the Sandinistas are impressed with
any evidence of resoluteness on the part of the Congress and
evidence of bipartisan resolve.''
   But he added, ``I think the Sandinistas are impressed more by
actions than by words.''

<TEXT>
   Sixty-four House Democrats are asking Gov.
Michael Dukakis to commit himself to a strong United States space
program to encourage young people to pursue science and engineering
careers.
   ``The present administration has allowed our space program to
lose direction and founder,'' said a letter handed to Dukakis on
Wednesday by Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, whose district includes
NASA's Lewis Research Center.
   She had originated the letter and circulated it among the others
for their signature.
   ``We as Democrats believe that our party must pick up the fallen
torch of space exploration and carry it high,'' it said. ``The next
president will have the choice of leading America to a permanent
presence in space or allowing other, more ambitious countries to

   The letter said that a successful space program needs a
well-educated workforce but that young Americans aren't pursuing
the necessary studies.
   ``More than half of all graduate degrees earned in science and
engineering at American institutions go to foreign nationals,'' it
added. ``A strong civilian space program provides incentives for
young people to pursue a career in science and or engineering and
is necessary to ensuring a sturdy American technology base.''

   Two women have been elected bishops of the United Methodist
Church, the fourth and fifth women to hold that position in the
church's 20-year history.
   Delegates of the North Central Jurisdictional Conference meeting
in De Kalb, Ill., on Thursday selected the Rev. Sharon Brown
Christopher, 43, to serve as bishop for the 9.1 million-member
church, the second-largest Protestant denomination.
   Christopher was elected on the 28th ballot by 339 votes.
   ``I am touched in the deepest of ways by the confidence my
Wisconsin colleagues have placed in me, a confidence in the
possibility of my giving leadership through the episcopacy,''
Christopher said.
   Her election came one day after delegates to a United Methodist
Northeast Jurisdictional Conference elected the Rev. Susan Morrison
a bishop in a surprise move.
   Morrison's name was forwarded as a candidate in the sixth round
of balloting Wednesday at the Northeast Jurisdictional Conference
in Buckhannon, W.Va. She won on the 18th ballot, receiving 255 of
392 votes.
   Christopher was assigned to the church's Minnesota district, one
of the jurisdiction's 10 episcopal areas. Morrison was assigned to
the Philadelphia area.
   Judith Craig of Detroit is the only other active female United
Methodist bishop. Leontine Kelly of San Francisco, who retired in
1984, and the late Marjorie Matthews of Wisconsin were the other
women bishops.
   Morrison said was surprised at her election because her name was
added to the ballot without her knowledge.
   ``I'm really kind of stunned,'' said Morrison, council director
of the church's Baltimore conference. ``Nobody approached me to ask
me.''
   The Northeast and North-central conferences were among five
regional conferences the United Methodist Church held this week.
   The Southeast Jurisdictional Conference elected only the second
black bishop in its 48-year history late Wednesday. Joseph Bethea,
55, district superintendent of the North Carolina Conference, was
elected on the 12th ballot.
   ``I see me serving as a kind of model for young people of all
races,'' he said Thursday.
   The United Methodist Church was formed in 1968 by the merger of
the Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren Church.

   Heavy rain in western Japan has killed at least
four people and left 11 missing as swollen waters flooded homes,
closed highways and disrupted local train service, police said
Friday.
   Regional police said on Thursday they recovered the bodies of
three family members who drowned when flooding waters washed their
car off a road near Toba, Mie prefecture, 205 miles southwest of
Tokyo along the Pacific coast.
   Police said they recovered another victim late Thursday who
drowned after his motorcyle was swept off a road in the same region
of Mie prefecture.
   Japan's Meteorological Agency said periodic downpours that began
early Thursday would continue in western and central Japan.
   The agency said early Friday that 3.4 inches of rain fell over a
one-hour period in the region of Tottori prefecture, 310 miles
southwest of Tokyo on the Japan Sea side, setting off minor land
slides.

   Authorities have seized hundreds of
rifles, grenades and other weapons in a nationwide crackdown to
ensure law and order during the July 24 general election, a police
official said Friday.
   Most of the weapons were seized in Chantaburi, Prachinburi and
Kanchanaburi provinces on Thailand's troubled borders with Cambodia
and Burma, said Lt. Col. Nopporn Sangsuwan of the Provincial Police
Policy and Planning Board.
   Police seized more than 1,700 rifles, including M-16s, 112 hand
grenades and 10,413 rounds of ammunition, he said.
   The general election was scheduled after Prime Minister Prem
Tinsulanonda dissolved Parliament in April when the main party in
his governing coalition challenged his policies.

   About 1,500 striking workers from a
bankrupt food processing plant met with government officials in the
capital Friday and returned home after winning a promise of higher
pay.
   More than 5,000 of Agrokomerc's 8,500 workers went on strike
Thursday, demanding more pay in the latest labor unrest caused by
the government's economic austerity plan.
   About 1,500 of the workers rode on buses to Belgrade, where they
were met by hundreds of police officers who sealed off an area
around Parliament.
   Shouts of ``Let's March to Parliament!'' and ``We Are Not Moving
Anywhere!'' went up from the Agrokomerc workers as they pressed for
wage increases and more state investment in the company.
   The workers are receiving guaranteed minimum salaries of about
$50 monthly, ``which is not enough for survival,'' Fuad Pasalic,
the head of the company's trade union, was quoted by Belgrade radio
as telling government officials.
   ``Our children are hungry and have no clothes to wear,'' he said.
   After meeting Bosnian and federal leaders in Belgrade, the
Agrokomerc workers, who appeared tired and dejected, said they won
a promise of a raise to $70 a month. They then boarded the 25 buses
to take them back home.
   Agrokomerc is in the Bosnia town of Velika Kladusa, 250 miles
west of Belgrade. Some of the workers wore the traditional
headscarves and colorful oriental trouser-skirts of the area.
   On Thursday, truck drivers blocked all traffic in Velika
Kladusa, the Politika Ekspres newspaper said.
   Agrokomerc, once touted as a model Socialist enterprise, is
being sold off gradually to cover debts incurred after it
circulated about $1 billion worth of uncovered promissory notes.
   The financial scandal, Yugoslavia's biggest since World War II,
was uncovered in August. Only 8,500 of the company's 13,000
workforce are still on the payroll.
   Workers throughout Yugoslavia are experiencing hardship as the
government implements an austerity program designed to reduce 175
percent inflation and limit the $21 billion foreign debt.
   On July 6, thousands of workers from Yugoslavia's largest rubber
and shoe plant broke into the parliament building to press demands
for higher pay.

   Police Chief Clarence Dickson announced his
retirement today after 3{ years at helm of an 1,100-member
department rocked by corruption and confronted by rising violence
against its officers.
   ``This was entirely my own idea,'' the department's first black
chief said at a news conference. ``I felt like the highlights of my
career I had already experienced.''
   Dickson, 54, who joined the force in 1960, became eligible for
retirement this year and said he simply decided to take it. He said
one of the highlights of his tenure was eliminating corruption
among Miami police.
   During his tenure, about 100 officers were convicted of crimes,
forced to resign or disciplined for offenses ranging from
participating in a deadly drug ripoff ring to personal drug use.
   In the same period, Miami police officers have been the target
of increasingly violent attacks, with three officers shot in the
line of duty this year, one fatally.
   Police have blamed the violence on rising drug trafficking and
drug use and easier access to guns in this racially mixed city of
370,000.
   City officials immediately announced that Dickson, whose
appointment was seen as a response to the bloody riots in Miami's
Liberty City section in 1980, would be replaced by Assistant Chief
Perry C. Anderson, who is also black.

<TEXT>
   The United Nations Command on Friday
accused North Korea of trying to undermine the 1988 Olympics in
Seoul by threatening war.
   The command made the allegation in response to North Korean
charges that the United States and South Korea were using the
Olympics as a cover to create a ``war machine.''
   ``The world will not be deceived or misled,'' said U.S. Rear
Adm. William T. Pendley, chief U.N. Command delegate to the
Military Armistice Commission.
   ``Your attempts to contrive an atmosphere of danger on the
Korean peninsula, in a transparent attempt to undermine the
upcoming Seoul Olympics, will not succeed,'' he said.
   The U.N. Command is made up of the United States and 15 other
countries that fought on the side of South Korea during the 1950-53
Korean War. The Korean peninsula has been divided into the
pro-Western South and the communist North since 1945.
   The command has repeatedly charged that North Korea is trying to
create military tension to try to disrupt the 1988 Summer Olympic
Games in September. The North has made a series of accusations in
recent months.
   North Korea demanded to co-host the Games, but international
Olympics authorities refused. The North has said it will boycott
the Games, and South Korean and U.S. authorities fear possible
sabotage.
   Pendley rejected North Korean charges of tension in the
Demilitarized Zone, the line separating the two Koreas. He said the
fact that North Korean soldiers were working on roads, dams and
sports facilities in the DMZ indicated a lack of tension.
   The chief North Korean delegate, Army Maj. Gen. Li Tae Ho, said
that North Korea called the meeting to protest a U.S. buildup of
troops, missiles, aircraft and tanks.
   He claimed the United States and South Korea were preparing for
war. He cited as examples the recent visits of the U.S. Navy
aircraft carriers the USS Midway and the USS Carl Vinson to the
area.
   ``The Olympics is not sponsored by the United States and it's
not responsible for its security,'' Li said.
   The United States, which has 42,000 troops based in the South
under a mutual defense pact against the North, is to help protect
the Olympic Games in September and plans to deploy aircraft carrier
groups off the Korean peninsula.
   The Military Armistice Commission consists of delegates from the
U.N. Command on one side and North Korea and China on the other.

<HEAD>Little-Known Work Brings Record; Turner Flops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a turnabout of fortune at Christie's art
auction house Friday, a little-known work brought 16 times the
artist's record price but one by the illustrious J.M.W. Turner did
not meet its minimum and was withdrawn.
   The Turner, a dreamy landscape in oil called ``Cicero at the
Villa,'' was among the last works by the English artist, who lived
from 1775-1851.
   It had been expected to break the record for the artist of 7.37
million pounds ($12.3 million) but the highest offer of 6.2 million
pounds ($10.3 million), was short of the minimum fixed by the
owner, Evelyn de Rothschild.
   ``Two Leopards Playing'' by the 19th-century Swiss artist
Jacques-Laurent Agasse, on the other hand, sold for 3.85 million
pounds ($6.44 million).
   Agasse's previous record was $385,000. He produced the oil,
which went to a telephone bidder, in 1808 for an English patron.
   ``The market's always full of surprises and sometimes it goes
both ways,'' said William Hanham, a spokesman for Christie's.
``We're pleased that the Agasse has done so well and obviously
disappointed about the Turner.''
   One reason for high expectations about the 1839 Turner work was
that most of his paintings are in museums.
   Anne Montefiore of the auction house said Christie's expects the
painting to be sold later through a private offer from a buyer
whose name was not revealed.
   The previous record for an Agasse was set in June 1987 with the
sale in New York of ``Lord Rivers Coursing on Newmarket Heath.''
Ms. Montefiore said interest in ``Two Leopards Playing'' was high
because the artist's works are ``very rare.''

<TEXT>
   While the United States bakes under
record-breaking heat waves, England has been sloshing through
another cool, wet summer.
   The sogginess, which optimists call unseasonal, has slightly
dampened the tourist trade. But for some parched visitors from the
United States, it's becoming an attraction.
   According to the London Weather Center, southeast England was
drenched with 1{ times the average amount of rain during the first
two weeks of July. Temperatures have been several degrees below
normal, the center says, and there has been only 80 percent of the
normal amount of sunshine.
   ``It's pretty bad,'' said a spokesman at the weather office, who
requested anonymity in keeping with civil service rules. ``We've
had three fairly poor summers in a row. If we keep on going, it'll
be a fourth.''
   That prospect worries some in the tourism business.
   At the London Zoo, spokeswoman Sue Copsey said attendance is
``slightly down'' because of the weather. ``We're obviously hoping
that August will be nice,'' she said.
   The sentiment is shared at Guided Tours of London, which
conducts walking tours of the British capital. An employee there
said because of the weather, ``We're finding that (people are) not
turning up.''
   But overall, British tourism officials say, the gray skies and
tepid temperatures haven't kept foreign visitors away.
   ``As far as overseas visitors, the weather doesn't affect
numbers,'' said Bob Barton, an official with the British Tourist
Authority. ``Most people coming to Britain expect to get bad
weather.''
   But bad is in the eye of the beholder.
   American tourists questioned at random said they found the wet,
cool London weather a welcome change from the searing heat in parts
of the United States.
   ``I came from a 105-degree heat wave and I'm very happy to be
here,'' said Joyce Fogg of Fair Lawn, N.J.
   Standing in a long line outside a tourist eatery under a sky
threatening yet another downpour, Ms. Fogg said she was not
disappointed with London's notoriously bad weather. ``I was told
that it would be rainy,'' she said.
   Her 14-year-old daughter Susan chimed in: ``I love it. It's
great to be out of the heat and be in the coolness.''
   Judy Tichenor, chaperoning a group of students from Portland,
Ore., admitted it would be nice to have had some sunshine. But she
added: ``It hasn't disappointed us that much. We brought umbrellas.
We brought a lot of them.''
   To Britons, the occasional sunny day is becoming a novelty.
   But Barton, the Tourist Authority official, sees a silver lining
in the rain clouds. ``For people from some parts of the world,'' he
said, ``our weather is a novelty, part of the attraction.''

   A woman who said she has received graphic
letters and telephone calls from readers of three ``swingers''
magazines has filed a $4.5 million lawsuit against the
publications, claiming they ran her address in ads without her
permission.
   Marie Mize sued the publishers of Southern Swinger Magazine,
Southern Swing Fever and Harvey for Loving People, according to the
lawsuit filed this week in U.S. District Court at Jackson.
   As a result of the advertisements, Mize has been ``inundated
with a voluminous amount of letters, cards and photographs'' from
readers containing graphic expressions of their sexual practices,
the lawsuit states. Mize also has received many anonymous calls,
according to the lawsuit.
   Neither Mize nor her attorney, Omar Craig of Oxford, would
discuss the lawsuit Thursday.
   Theresa Dickens, an employee of SSM Publications of Nashville,
Tenn., which publishes Southern Swinger, said she believes Mize may
be getting the mail of a couple who had Mize's post office box
before moving.
   ``This couple has placed numerous ads with us. They recently
moved to Illinois and are placing ads with us from there,'' Dickens
said.
   SSM President Bobby Hollingsworth said about 90 percent of those
placing ads are ``liberal-minded professional couples looking for
other liberal-minded professionals.''
   Another ad giving Mize's post office box appeared in Southern
Swing Fever, a magazine published by Jerome Phillips of Fort
Pierce, Fla., with a nude photograph of a woman with her face
scratched out, according to the lawsuit.
   The woman in the photograph looks similar to Mize, but is not
her, the lawsuit states.
   There were no listed telephone numbers for either Phillips or
his magazine in Fort Pierce. Harvey Shapiro of Harvey Shapiro
Enterprises of New York said Thursday he wasn't aware of the
lawsuit and couldn't comment.

   Heavy snowfalls have trapped
50,000 people in the mountains of Lesotho and many are without
food, firewood and proper clothing, the South African Broadcasting
Corp. said Friday.
   Ten people have been found dead in the past week, according to a
Radio Lesotho report monitored in South Africa.
   Nearly a dozen young boys who shepherd flocks in remote areas of
the mountains died in similar snowfalls in September, when the tiny
kingdom surrounded by South Africa appealed for blankets, rescue
equipment, fuel and food from the Pretoria government.
   A sick man who died before he could be taken to a hospital, and
three children who fell into a dam died in the Maluti mountains
earlier in the week.
   The bodies of three men and three children who died from
exposure in the Letseng-La-Terai area of the Mokhotlong district
were discovered Friday, Radio Lesotho said.
   Royal Air Force helicopters have flown over the Mokhotlong
district, where all roads have been closed by the snow. South
African vehicles have been brought in to scrape paths into the
mountain villages.
   ``Thousands of people have been cut off from the outside world
for a week and they have run out of food and firewood. Many people
have begun eating snow to stay alive,'' said Radio South Africa.
``In many places the children have no shoes, and only one blanket
to protect them from the cold.''
   It noted that when the snow begins to melt, conditions may
worsen, because access roads will be washed out, as they were last
year.
   The heaviest snowfalls in years also have cut off towns and
villages, disrupted road, telephone and electricity links in South
Africa's Natal and eastern Cape provinces.
   The main road from the central Johannesburg-Pretoria area to
Natal is closed, leaving thousands of motorists stranded, and about
100 hikers have been trapped in the Drakensberg Mountains in Natal,
Radio South Africa reported.
   It said the Karasberg Mountains in South-West Africa have
received the heaviest snowfall since 1965.

   The space agency announced Friday it
has transferred custody of the Delta space rocket launch complex
and East Coast Delta launch operations to the Air Force.
   The transfer ends an era during which NASA launched 143 Deltas
from two pads at Launch Complex 17 in 28 years. An additional 38
launches have been conducted from Vandenberg Air Force Base,
Calif., and the McDonnell Douglas-built rocket has achieved a 95
percent success record, orbiting more than 60 communications
satellites, 30 weather satellites and dozens of payloads for
science and Earth resources research.
   NASA's first Delta launch here on May 13, 1960, failed, but the
second, three months later, orbited the Echo communications
satellite. The agency's last launch, on Feb. 8 this year, sent a
Strategic Defense Inititive payload into space.
   The agency still has one Delta rocket remaining in its
inventory. It will boost a scientific satellite next year from
Vandenberg.
   President Reagan last year endorsed a private-sector commercial
launch business using unmanned rockets and directed NASA to
purchase launch services from companies like McDonnell Douglas and
General Dynamics. In April 1987, the space agency transferred its
authority over the Atlas-Centaur space rocket and Launch Complex 36
here to General Dynamics.
   Until the transfers of the two rockets, NASA had purchased the
boosters from the companies and had acted as its own launch agency.
Now it must buy launch services from the companies.
   The Air Force plans to use the two Delta launch pads here to
launch SDI and other military payloads with Delta and advanced
Delta 2 rockets purchased from McDonnell Douglas. The first Delta 2
launch is scheduled here later this year.
   McDonnell Douglas will negotiate with the Air Force for the use
of the pads to launch Delta 2 commerical payloads, with eight such
launches planned from 1989 to 1992.
   The Air Force also plans to take over Atlas-Centaur Launch
Complex 36 to launch an advanced model of the rocket with military
payloads. General Dynamics then will negotiate with the Air Force
for use of the two pads there for commercial satellite launches.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said on
Friday the United States should not try to stop the Chinese from
selling arms to Middle East nations by slowing high technology
sales to China.
   Shultz, on his second day in Beijing, said there were other,
constructive ways to persuade the Chinese not to sell the weapons.
He was responding to reporters' questions about a published report
that Beijing had agreed to sell intermediate-range, M-9 missiles to
Syria, an enemy of Israel.
   Shultz said Chinese leaders told him their only ballistic
missile sales in the Middle East have been to Saudi Arabia.
   More than 100 U.S. congressmen sent Shultz a cable Thursday
warning that future transfers of U.S. high technlogoy to China
would be ``jeopardized'' if the sale to Syria went through.
   Shultz said he got word of the cable only after his meetings
with top Chinese leaders. He met privately with senior leader Deng
Xiaoping, Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang and Premier Li Peng.
   ``I think the way to try to get at it with the Chinese is other
kinds of constructive ways,'' he said.
   The Los Angeles Times reported on Thursday that Beijing had
agreed to sell intermediate range M-9 missiles to Syria.
   Senior Reagan administration officials traveling with Shultz
have said the Chinese are believed to be marketing the weapons,
which have a maximum range of about 370 miles, but there are no
indications of a final sale.
   The officials say the M-9, which would be capable of striking
targets in Israel if launched from Syria, is at least nine months
away from production and that a prototype is still being tested in
China.
   He said the Chinese had not promised to halt ballistic missile
sales to the Middle East, but the subject was still open to
discussion. ``We didn't come to any agreements about it, but ...
I'm sure that the subject will continue to be an important one on
our agenda,'' Shultz told reporters.
   Angry over alleged Chinese sales of anti-ship Silkworm missiles
to Iran, Washington last fall temporarily tightened regulation of
high-technology sales to China.
   The United States also has been critical of Beijing's sale this
spring of intermediate-range CSS-2, or East Wind, missiles to Saudi
Arabia.
   On Saturday, Shultz flies to Seoul, South Korea, the seventh
stop on a nine-country trip through Asia and the Pacific.
   Discussions in Beijing also focused on the Khmer Rouge, the
Chinese-backed Cambodian guerrillas who some fear may muscle their
way back into power.
   The Khmer Rouge massacred hundreds of thousands of fellow
Cambodians while in power during the mid-1970s. Vietnam ousted them
when it invaded in 1978.
   Shultz said the United States and China have ``a very broad
agreement as to certain aspects of that situation,'' including
``rather similar views'' on stopping a Khmer Rouge comeback. China
officially supports a three-party Cambodian opposition coalition
that includes the Khmer Rouge.
   Although the Chinese have said little publicly about the
Cambodian problem during Shultz's visit, the American side has
strongly indicated that Beijing is sensitive to the Khmer Rouge
dilemma and willing to do something about it.
   Shultz said both countries are pressing for a total pull-out of
Vietnamese troops and both view Prince Norodom Sihanouk as the
central figure in a future Cambodian government. Sihanouk abruptly
resigned this week as head of the anti-Vietnamese coalition.
   There have been several proposals, including one from Sihanouk,
for a peacekeeping force to ensure a cease-fire, the peaceful
formation of a government and free elections in Cambodia.
   Vietnam has pledged to remove all its troops, currently
estimated at 120,000 by U.S. sources, by 1990. This has led to
fears that the Khmer Rouge would shoulder aside their two, less
powerful non-communist allies in the anti-Vietnamese coalition and
seize power once Hanoi's forces have left.

   A Vietnamese ship picked up three
U.S. Navy fliers whose plane had crashed in the South China Sea and
took them to Vietnam on Friday, the Navy said.
   Vietnamese authorities informed the State Department in
Washington that the three were aboard the ship and headed toward
Vietnam, said a statement telephoned to news agencies by the
information office at Subic Naval Base.
   ``Their conditions are unknown at this time,'' the statement
said.
   The official Voice of Vietnam radio said in a broadcast later
that the Americans ``were given care and good treatment'' by
Vietnamese workers living on some islands in the Spratly group.
   The aviators were returning on Tuesday from Singapore to the
U.S. military base at Subic Bay, 50 miles northwest of Manila, when
they radioed they were ditching their CT-39E twin-engine jet in the
vicinity of the Spratly islands.
   An extensive search had been under way for the three.
   The Voice of Vietnam broadcast, monitored in Bangkok, Thailand,
said Hanoi had ``informed the American government of this
incident.''
   The plane's crew members were identified by Subic Naval Base as
Lt. Richard K. Maurer, 30, the pilot, of Harvey's Lake, Pa.;
co-pilot Lt. j.g. Elizabeth A. Steinnecker, 29, of Corpus Christi,
Texas; and Petty Officer 1st Class Michael A. Neel, 34, of

   The metropolitan-area bus service has
reversed itself and agreed to carry a Quaker group's advertisement
saying ``Nicaragua is not our enemy.''
   The ad was to make its first appearance today on 18 buses of the
Kansas City Area Tranportation Authority.
   The American Friends Service Committee, a national Quaker
organization, asked the agency last fall to carry an ad that
pictured two Nicaraguan children and read: ``Nicaragua is not our
enemy. Let Nicaraguans live in peace.''
   The agency refused, citing its policy against controversial
advertising. It reversed itself after the Quaker group, with the
support of the American Civil Liberties Union, threatened to sue on
free speech grounds.
   Dick Davis, the authority's general manager, said the bus
service felt the case ``was not worth the litigation costs.''

<TEXT>
   There is one well-known Democratic
politician of Greek ancestry from Massachusetts who is not seeking
the presidency and isn't even going to the Democratic convention in
Atlanta.
   ``I have no political ambitions, whatsoever,'' says former U.S.
Sen. Paul Tsongas, once hailed as a liberal maverick on Capitol
Hill. ``We're much happier now than when I was in office.''
   He has scaled down his aspirations since he disclosed that he
had cancer and left the Senate one month before his 43rd birthday.
   The last traces of cancer are gone, but he prefers the limelight
of this old mill town to the spotlight of Washington.
   Though no longer a senator, Tsongas still makes headlines in The
Sun, a 55,000-circulation daily that serves his hometown. It has
been reporting his doings ever since he sat on the Lowell City
Council in the late 1960s and right on through his election to the
U.S. House in 1974, first Democrat to win the district in about 90
years, and to the Senate in 1979.
   One recent edition landed on Tsongas' side porch carrying an
article about his tangle over the ouster of the Lowell school
superintendent.
   He also created a statewide stir recently when, as the head of a
study commission on the environment, he called for a building
moratorium on Cape Cod. The matter, which will be on the November
ballot, is still being hotly debated.
   Tsongas enjoys watching his friend, Gov. Michael Dukakis, reach
for the White House, in particular because the likely Democratic
presidential nominee expounds Tsongas' philosophy that the
Democrats' survival depends on integrating the needs of business.
   ``Liberals have to be concerned with economics. Democrats have
to be the friends of business. ... The major issue facing the
country is the sense of decline, that we're going to be some
latter-day Great Britain,'' he said.
   Although he once floated the idea of running for president, it's
enough for Tsongas to stump for his friend to know he isn't missing
a thing.
   In some ways he prefers wielding influence as an ex-senator.
   ``I'm really struck by how much respect there is for the office
of senator,'' he said. ``It is very special ... and you can use
that. How many 47-year-old former senators do you know?
   ``Certainly in people's dealings with me, they are much more
accepting of me now than when I was in office. I have no political
ambitions, so I'm less tainted. Also, there's the illness issue.''
   In September 1983 he was diagnosed as having non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, a relatively mild cancer of the lymph nodes that attacks
part of the immune system. Nearly four months later, in the middle
of his second run for the Senate, Tsongas decided it would be
better for everyone if he took his wife, Nikki, and their three
daughters home to Lowell.
   Since then he has undergone a bone marrow transplant and has
been declared cancer-free.
   Tsongas works for a prestigious Boston law firm, Foley Hoag &
Eliot, making deals and serving on corporate boards and taking pro
bono assignments.
   His latest battle, over his proposal that construction on the
Cape be halted until the peninsula gets control of development, has
led to abuse from builders and developers while filling his mailbox
with letters from Cape Codders telling him to stick with it.
   ``I know I'm doing well because my political enemies are angry
at me,'' he said, with glee, recalling the wrath of a roomful of
developers at a public hearing on the issue. ``Six hundred people
were shouting at me!''
   He shrugged. `I have nothing to fear, politically, and, with
what I've been through ...''
   ``The day I turn around and there's nobody behind me, is the day
I get out of it. The mail I get is so passionate, you cannot read
that mail and say: `I'm going to walk away.' ''

   A drawing of a space shuttle lifting

   A picture of the patch, sprinkled with seven stars to

Friday by the space agency.
   Around the border are the last names of the five astronauts who
will fly the mission: Commander Robert L. Gibson, pilot Guy S.
Gardner and mission specialists Jerry L. Ross, Richard M. Mullane
and William M. Shepherd.
   NASA said each crewman contributed to the design.
   Their flight aboard shuttle Atlantis is scheduled for November
and will carry a classified Defense Department payload.
   The crew patch for the first post-Challenger flight _ that of
Discovery in early September _ shows a stylized shuttle lifting off
and includes in the background a sun and the seven-starred Big
Dipper as a tribute to the seven astronauts who died in the
Challenger explosion Jan. 28, 1986.

<TEXT>
   A burglar has been serving himself at a
restaurant, repeatedly making off with 14-ounce steaks from the
freezer, and the owner is cooking up a stakeout.
   ``That's all they take is steak. I just don't know what to think
any more, because they've gotten away with a lot of it lots of
times,'' said Tommy C. Hamby, owner of The Hoffbrau.
   The steakhouse was burglarized this week for the ninth time this
year, police said. Hamby said the haul has totaled hundreds of
steaks.
   Police are interviewing witnesses, Sgt. Jerold Seidl said.
``There appears to be a pattern. It sounds like someone is getting
full on steak.''
   Sixty 14-ounce, top sirloin steaks were taken after 11:30 p.m.
Wednesday, when someone broke in through the front window of the
restaurant.
   ``The alarm went off when he broke the window, but he went
straight to the icebox and got out before police got here,'' Hamby
said. ``He's pretty brave to do that on Sixth Street on a busy
night.''
   Hamby said 50 to more than 100 steaks have been taken each time
the restaurant has been hit, and the thief also has broken in
through the ceiling and the kitchen window.
   ``I had to put burglar bars on the side windows and would rather
not do that to the front, but I may have to because it's running up
there,'' Hamby said.
   He estimated his losses at $5,000 to $7,000, including repairs
on broken windows.

   Saying that America's greatest resource ``is
the genius of our people,'' President Reagan today presented medals
for advances in science and technology to 30 individuals prominent
in research and industrial technology.
   In a brief ceremony at the Old Executive Office Building, Reagan
said that the most important activity that his administration can
do is ``knock down the barriers to progress.''
   ``America's greatest resource is not the land,'' said the
president. ``No, America's greatest resource is the genius of our
people.''
   Earlier, one of the winners, Joseph L. Goldstein of the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said in
an interview that heart disease may be controlled within a
generation through a wider acceptance of healthier lifestyles and
the development of drugs now in the laboratory.
   Goldstein said he expects that people who are genetically
susceptible to heart disease eventually will be identified through
blood tests, and that the number of people killed by heart attack
will be reduced dramatically.
   ``We may control heart disease before we thoroughly understand
it,'' said Goldstein. He said he and other scientists now are
tracking down the precise genetic factors that lead to the
development of atherosclerosis, the major form of heart disease.
Goldstein said this could lead to a blood test that would enable
doctors to identify patients most at risk for heart attack long
before any heart disease has developed.
   Goldstein and Michael S. Brown, also of the University of Texas,
won the Nobel prize for discovery of the basic mechanism
controlling the formation of cholesterol, a major element in the
development of heart disease.
   Twenty of the medal recipients received the national medal of
science, an honor established by Congress in 1959 to recognize
achievements in physical, biological, mathematical, behavioral,
social or engineering sciences.
   In addition to Goldstein and Brown, those receiving the science
medal are William O. Baker of Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray
Hill, N.J.; Konrad E. Bloch, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.;
D. Allan Bromley, Yale University, New Haven, Conn.; Paul Chu,
University of Houston, Houston; Stanley N. Cohen, Stanford
University, Stanford, Calif.; Elias J. Corey, Harvard; Daniel C.
Drucker, University of Florida, Gainesville, Fla.; Milton Friedman,
Stanford; Ralph E. Gomory, IBM, Armonk, N.Y.; Willis M. Hawkins,
Lockheed Corp., Calabasas, Calif.; Maurice R. Hilleman, Merck and
Co., West Point, Pa.; George W. Housner, California Institute of
Technology, Pasadena, Calif; Eric R. Kandel, Columbia University
and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, N.Y.;
Joseph B. Keller, Stanford; Walter Kohn, University of California,
Santa Barbara; Norman F. Ramsey, Harvard; Jack Steinberger,
European Center for Nuclear Research, Geneva, Switzerland, and
Rosalyn S. Yalow, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, New York, N.Y.
   Reagan is awarding the national medal of technology to 10
people. The winners are Edwin H. Land, founder of the Polaroid
Corp. and now president of the Rowland Institute for Science in
Cambridge; John L. Atwood, Rockwell International Corp., El
Segundo, Calif.; Arnold O. Beckman, Beckman Instruments, Irvine,
Calif.; Paul M. Cook, Raychem Corp., Menlo Park, Calif.; Richard H.
Dennard, IBM, Yorktown Heights, N.Y.; Harold E. Edgerton,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge; Clarence L.
Johnson, Lockheed; David Packard, Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto,
Calif.; Raymond Damadian, FONAR Corp., Melville, N.Y., and Paul C.
Lauterbur, University of Illinois at Urbana.
   The technology medal was created in 1980 by Congress to
recognize those who advance American technology and improved the
nation's economy, environment or social well-being.
   A White House spokesman said the medalists were nominated by
committees directed by the Department of Commerce. The names then
were referred to Reagan, who awards the medals and certificates.

<TEXT>
   He marched with King, won election as Georgia's
first black congressman since Reconstruction and later championed
human rights as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
   Now Andrew Young is Atlanta's mayor and chief booster, using the
Democratic National Convention as a hometown showcase for the sales
pitch he makes around the world.
   With 13,000 reporters in town or on the way, Young is scheduling
daily news conferences in contrast to his usual practice of
scheduling none.
   As a prominent black Democratic office-holder, he came under
early pressure to endorse Jesse Jackson. But he steered clear,
saying that as host mayor for the convention he shouldn't be taking
such stands.
   ``I'd like to see Atlanta have a worldwide reputation as a
market center,'' Young said in a recent interview. ``We've been
trying to find ways to create jobs and to wipe out some of the
problems of poverty in our city by actually attracting and
generating new wealth.''
   Young's emphasis on improving Atlanta with private investment
has won enough support from white business leaders to have him
thinking aloud about a run for governor next year on a platform of
economic development.
   But the mayor also bears some bruises from charges he has
forgotten the poor while courting the rich.
   ``I think he has been good for Atlanta as a whole, bringing in
business, but I don't think the low-income community looks at him
as being good for them,'' said Louise Watley, president of the
tenants' association in the Carver Homes housing project.
   Young said he was wounded when Ms. Watley invited him and the
news media to a tenants' meeting and then issued a scathing
``indictment'' of him, starting 90 minutes of accusations by
project residents that he had failed them.
   ``It really hurt because these are people who have always been
my close friends and supporters,'' he said. He also said his
administration has brought jobs to the area around Carver Homes and
money for improvements in the project itself.
   Young said the incident has changed his outlook on handling such
functions _ ``I'm not a sucker and I'm not going to make myself
available to get set up any more'' _ but not his emotions about
dealing with criticism from the poor.
   ``I grew up middle class, so from early childhood I had to deal
with the question of middle class guilt, and I found it not very
productive. So you have to maintain your sense of responsibility,
your sense of vision and hope, but not pay much attention to your
critics,'' said the 56-year-old mayor.
   Young, trained as a minister, was a top aide to Martin Luther
King Jr. during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. After
King's death, he won a congressional seat in an Atlanta district.
Then came his tenure as Jimmy Carter's U.N. ambassador, giving him
an international reputation.
   Since his election as mayor in 1981, he has circled the globe in
search of new business for Atlanta.
   He displays a hands-off approach to the day-to-day running of
the city.
   ``Basically my style is to get intelligent and dedicated people,
get them committed to a vision and in a certain direction and then
give them all the support I can,'' he said.
   Young himself has plenty of supporters.
   ``We were losing a lot of investment to the suburbs, and we've
seen a lot of investment come back into the city'' during Young's
administration, said Dan Sweat, who recently concluded 15 years as
president of Central Atlanta Progress, a downtown business group.
   The Atlanta skyline bristles with new development, and the mayor
can rattle off projects worth several billion dollars, still on the
drawing boards.
   ``It's beyond the comprehension of most of us,'' said Charles
Loudermilk, a businessman and lifelong Atlantan who usually votes
Republican but was an early supporter of Young.
   ``Andy Young has to get a tremendous amount of the credit
because all of us feel good about ourselves, our businesses and our
city, and frankly that was not true when Andy came in,'' said
Loudermilk.
   ``He has an ability to open any door in the world,'' he said.
``I was with him in France and we met with (President Francois)
Mitterand, the mayor and all of the ministers and bankers, and
(Young) is an absolute, absolute world hero.''

<TEXT>
   A Metro-Dade police major was appointed
Friday as the state's first anti-drug czar, a move Gov. Bob
Martinez hopes will bring Florida's drug problem into the open as a
first step toward recovery.
   Douglas Hughes, 43, will chair Martinez's Drug Policy Task Force
and coordinate drug-war efforts among local state and federal
agencies.
   ``This is not a study commission. This is a recommending,
implementing group,'' said Martinez. ``What this policy unit does
it takes the drug problem out of the closet. It used to be and
still is in many areas, `Let's not acknowledge it because it's bad
for tourism, it's bad for business.'''
   Hughes has been director of Metro-Dade's substance-abuse control
program since its inception in March 1987, coordinating
interagency, school and private-sector efforts against drugs.
Martinez chose him mainly for that experience.
   ``No agency can do it alone,'' said Hughes. ``What you're seeing
much more than ever before, is law enforcement stepping forward ...
and saying we are aware that law enforcement alone cannot solve the
problem. That has brought agencies together.''
   Hughes has 22 years of experience in police work. He was a
member of the New York Police Department from 1964-71, and while a
member of the Metro-Dade force has been district manager for Dade's
Liberty City, an area torn by riots, drugs and poor economy.
   He will remain a member of the Metro-Dade force but will be on
loan to the state to protect his pension, said Martinez. He will
continue to collect a salary of $70,300.
   Brian Ballard, director of operations in the govenor's office,
said $125,000 has been earmarked for the new office. Also, three
departments each will assign one person to Hughes' office.

   The city of New Orleans has preliminary
approval from the state Bond Commission to borrow up to $30 million
to help pay its share of the Republican National Convention.
   The four-day convention opens Aug. 15 in the Louisiana Superdome.
   Paul Mitchell, New Orleans' finance director, told the
commission Thursday the city will repay the Louisiana Public
Facilities Authority by March 1.
   He said the city probably will need no more than $25 million to
cover such costs as police overtime.
   The commission will consider final authority for the loan at its
next meeting.

<HEAD>Marine With One-Lung Running Up Mount Whitney</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONE PINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Marine with one lung today neared the
final leg of a 146-mile run from scorching Death Valley, the lowest
point in the contiguous 48 states, to the summit of Mount Whitney,
the highest point.
   Maj. John Bates, 42, began his grueling trek at 8 p.m.
Wednesday. He was expected to reach the end of the paved road and
the start of the trail to 14,464-foot Mount Whitney before noon,
forest Ranger Clark Trowell said.
   Bates faced a 10.3-mile hike up a well-worn but extremely steep
path to the summit. The steepest part of the trail is between
12,000 and 13,700 feet, where even the most experienced hiker
struggles with the thin air.
   The Marine ate salty foods, drank large quantities of water and
took caffeine pills to stay awake but was suffering from cramps and
nausea. Bates, who lost a lung to a bullet in Vietnam in 1966, said
the run was for fun and to inspire other disabled veterans.
   He planned to run nonstop, going from 282 feet below sea level
to Mount Whitney's summit, in hopes of shaving five hours off the
record of 45 hours, 15 minutes.
   He appeared likely to break his personal best time: 63 hours, 12
minutes in 1986. He took two eight-hour sleep breaks during that
run.
   As his figure, blurred by heat waves, bobbed down the road
Thursday, his wife, Stephanie, followed in an air-conditioned
mobile home.
   ``I have been thinking about just yanking him into the car and
driving home,'' she said. She begged her husband to eat more tuna
sandwiches. ``They're a miracle cure _ lots of salt.''
   His run came during the hottest season for Death Valley, with
the daytime air temperature often reaching 120 degrees and the sand
200 degrees, said Death Valley Acting Chief Ranger Russell March.

<HEAD>Jackson's '88 Delegates Recall '72 Convention Fight With Daley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What a difference 16 years can make. Jesse
Jackson, the solo remaining also-ran in the field of candidates for
the Democratic presidential nomination, had to wage a bitter fight
just to win a seat on the Democratic convention floor in Miami in
1972.
   Nancy Jefferson remembers. One of Jackson's allies at that time
_ just as she is one of his delegates this time _ she was so
pleased with the rebels' victory at that steamy convention that she
took a plunge into a swimming pool with her clothes on.
   ``It was that kind of excitement,'' she says. ``It was a great
day.''
   The challenging bloc of four dozen renegade delegates faced
contempt of court and jail for pursuing their fight.
   Even after they won, it took a 9-0 decision by the U.S. Supreme
Court to nail down the victory. And the event may have played a
role in the demise of the political operation led by then-Chicago
Mayor Richard J. Daley, one of the most powerful big city political
machines in the country.
   Mrs. Jefferson, 64, chief executive officer of the Midwest
Community Council, a West Side group in Chicago, is headed to the
convention in Atlanta with at least four other Illinois delegates
who were with Jackson and then-alderman William Singer in the rebel
group in Miami.
   Here's how it happened:
   A week before the 1972 convention, the party's credentials
committee, which leaned toward George McGovern, granted the
Singer-Jackson delegates convention seats on a 71-61 vote. That
decision was challenged on the first day of the convention, a
session which lasted well into the next morning.
   The challenge failed in a floor vote. The memory still rankles
Thomas Lyons, one of the ousted Daley delegates.
   ``It was one of the most monstrous things I've ever seen,'' said
Lyons, 57, a former state senator. He said he and other delegates
received thousands of votes, ``and we were replaced by ... people
who met in somebody's living room. ... It was a theft.''
   McGovern, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1972, had
helped set the stage for the spectacle of keeping Daley from the
convention floor.
   After the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention in
Chicago, where anti-war demonstrators rocked the city and clashed
with Daley's city police force, McGovern chaired a commission that
rewrote party rules to make room for more minorities, women and
young people.
   ``The Cook County Democratic Committee, under Daley's
leadership, flagrantly violated every aspect of the rules,'' said
Saul Mendelson of Chicago, a Jackson delegate this year who was an
alternate with the 1972 rebels.
   The renegades held their own caucuses so they could offer an
alternative.
   The anti-machine Democrats in the city knew that a simple
protest would result in either a meaningless rebuke to the Daley
forces on the convention floor, or expulsion of the 59 Daley
people, leaving no representation for Chicago.
   Lyons saw the quickly called meetings as a political charade.
Singer agrees that his delegates, chosen in church basements and
living rooms, were not picked in orthodox ways. But ``I don't think
there was anyone in Chicago who didn't know what was going on,'' he
said.
   After the credentials committee action, Daley forces went to
court, and Cook County Circuit Judge Daniel A. Covelli prohibited
the Singer-Jackson delegates from taking their convention seats. He
threatened to jail leaders of the group if they disobeyed.
   Still, the rebels went to the convention, and faced a challenge
on the floor.
   That vote ``shaped up as the most dramatic moment of the 1972
convention,'' according to ``Clout: Mayor Daley and his City,'' a
1975 book by Chicago reporter and commentator Len O'Connor. ``The
power of the old guard was under challenge.''
   Mendelson said Daley, who was keeping in touch with the
delegation from his vacation home in Michigan, would not agree to
offers to split the delegate seats or take over leadership of the
renegades himself.
   When the floor vote was taken, the Singer-Jackson group kept
their seats.
   Critics said the Chicago rift would hurt McGovern's chances.
Maybe they did, but he lost 49 states, including Illinois, to GOP
incumbent Richard Nixon.
   Covelli's contempt-of-court order was stayed pending an appeal.
The Illinois Supreme Court later refused to hear the case, but the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled 9-0 for the Singer-Jackson group. The high
court said that a political party has the right to make and enforce
its own rules. That ended the threat of jail.
   Singer isn't convinced that the 1972 events led to the downfall
of Daley's machine. But Mrs. Jefferson thinks it was one step on
the path of opening political power in the Windy City to those who
had been shut out.
   ``I think it sort of ... changed the whole politics of
Chicago,'' she said.

following an explosion which damaged a park vehicle, military
headquarters said Friday.
   The suspects were killed Thursday during a combined army-air

far-northern section of the park near the border with Mozambique.
   Military headquarters said weapons were seized during the

   A federal judge today refused to provide
a sealed government affidavit to attorneys for defense consultant
Melvyn Paisley, a key figure in the massive defense procurement
investigation.
   Meanwhile, a federal magistrate in Los Angeles ordered the
government to unseal four other search warrant affidavits. However,
he delayed the unsealing until 5 p.m. EDT and the government said
it would appeal the decision.
   U.S. District Court Judge James C. Cacheris overruled a
magistrate who last week told Paisley's attorneys they could see
the 61-page affidavit so long as they showed it to no one else,
including Paisley.
   ``The court finds the magistrate's ruling is clearly
erroneous,'' Cacheris said.
   He agreed with U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson's arguments that the
government's case could be hurt by premature disclosure of the
affidavit, which outlines the government's case and provides a
wealth of detail about why investigators are looking into
activities of Paisley and his wife, Vicki.
   The affidavit was used by FBI agents to conduct searches of
Paisley's house and office.
   The government's sensitive investigation involves national
security issues as well as Pentagon officials, Cacheris said.
   E. Lawrence Barcella Jr., Paisley's attorney, said he was
disappointed with the ruling and was considering whether he should
appeal Cacheris' decision to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Hudson argued that the Paisleys and their lawyers only wanted
the affidavit to satisfy ``idle curiosity.'' But he said the papers
should remain sealed so the government can complete its probe.
   He promised Cacheris that the affidavit would be released to the
public within about a month.
   Paisley, a former assistant secretary of the Navy, is one of 40
people and companies that have been identified as targets of the
massive investigation of the Pentagon's $150-billion-a-year
procurement process.
   In Los Angeles, the search warrants ordered unsealed by U.S.
Magistrate Joseph Reichmann were executed on June 13 and permitted
government to search the offices of Northrop Corp., Teledyne
Industries, Litton Industries and the home of defense consultant
Fred Lackner.
   ``We are talking about the foundations of our country, the
defense of our country,'' Reichmann said in ruling on motions by
the Los Angeles Times, Copley Newspapers and the National
Broadcasting Corp.
   ``I've come to the conclusion there is this right of access, to
obtain things lodged with the court, prior to the return of an
indictment,'' he said.
   The investigation centers around allegations that defense
consultants paid bribes to Pentagon officials to obtain information
that would help contractors secure government projects.
   No charges have been filed in the investigation, but grand jury
subponeas have been issued to numerous people, including Paisley.

   Iran's foreign minister today accused the
United States of making excuses but not accepting responsibility
for its destruction of an Iranian jetliner and the deaths of the
290 people aboard.
   The Soviet Union said the U.S. Navy should leave the Persian
Gulf to avoid future tragedies like the shooting down of Iran Air
Flight 655. It said an international U.N. fleet should replace the
American warships.
   As the Security Council resumed debate on the July 3 incident,
the Soviets, Britain, France, China, Japan, and West Germany all
called on Iran to accept a year-old council resolution calling for
a cease-fire in the nearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali-Akbar Velayati said at a news
conference that ``the attitude of the U.S. administration is
similar to a rich man's son who drives when he's drunk. He thinks
money can buy everything, and that is not true.''
   The United States offered to pay compensation to the families of
the victims but said it did so out of humanitarian concerns and not
because it is legally obligated.
   Velayai said the U.S. offer would be acceptable only ``within
the context of the United States accepting responsibility for
shooting down the Iranian airliner.''
   U.S. officials say Navy forces shot down the airliner because
they thought it was an Iranian F-14 jet fighter.
   During debate, the Soviet representative, Valentin V. Lozinskiy,
said ``the tragedy has demonstrated once again that the United
States fleet must leave the waters of the Persian Gulf right away.''
   ``How can one regard as self-defense the destruction of a
passenger airliner flying within an established air corridor many
thousands of kilometers from the borders of the power that is
allegedly defending itself?'' he asked.
   British U.N. official John Birch expressed his country's
``profound regret'' over the loss of life but said the underlying
cause of the disaster, and of all war-related casualties in the
Persian Gulf, is Iran's refusal to accept the cease-fire resolution.
   Iran never decisively rejected the resolution but has insisted
that Iraq be branded the aggressor in the war as the first step
toward peace.
   France's representative, Pierre Brochand, said ``the
international community cannot pass judgment on such a tragic error
without the results'' of an inquiry by the International Civil
Aviation Organization in Montreal. The ICAO's governing council
agreed Thursday that such an inquiry should be conducted.
   ``We should of course take into account the conditions
prevailing in the region ... a region for years fraught with
insecurity because of the Iran-Iraq war,'' Brochand said, in
calling on Iran to honor the cease-fire resolution.
   The debate adjourned until Monday.
   Iran requested the council meeting to seek condemnation of the
USS Vincennes' downing of the Airbus A300 over the Strait of Hormuz
and to demand withdrawal of all American forces from the gulf. It
has not been able to muster the votes for a condemnation.
   On Thursday, Vice President George Bush called the incident a
``terrible human tragedy'' but said Iran shares responsibility. He
said the United States has a legal right to protect Middle East
shipping lanes.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said Iran and the 15 members of
the Security Council agreed that council President Paulo
Nogueira-Batista of Brazil would draft a document in consultation
with Iran and the members, which include the United States.
   Giuliani said it was not known whether the document would be a
resolution, which requires a vote, or a statement from the council
president adopted by consensus, which carries far less weight.
   The move was considered a confirmation that Iran had failed to
persuade a majority of the Security Council members to pass a
resolution denouncing the United States.
   The Vincennes and the USS Elmer Montgomery had skirmished with
Iranian attack boats just before the jetliner entered the area.
   The United States says the airliner did not respond to repeated
questioning by the Vincennes about its identity, and the cruiser's
captain believed it was an F-14 transmitting ambiguous signals and
descending in attack pattern.
   ``After seven unanswered warnings,'' Bush said, the captain
``did what he had to do to protect his ship and the lives of his
crew.''
   Velayati read what he said was a transcript of a communication
between Iran Air Flight 655, flying from a military-civilian
airport at Bandar Abbas, Iran, across the Strait of Hormuz to Dubai
in the United Arab Emirates, and the Bandar Abbas control tower
just before the attack.
   The transcript contained no warnings from the Vincennes or
communications with it.
   ``The shooting down of an Iranian civil airliner, flying on a
scheduled flight known to the U.S. warships, and using an
internationally established and published civilian airway and
transmitting signals identifying itself as a civilian airliner
could not have been a mistake,'' he said.
   Bush said, ``I will not dignify with a response the charge that
we deliberately destroyed Iran Air 655.''

   A federal magistrate ordered the government
today to unseal documents outlining the basis for the California
portion of its probe of fraud in the defense industry. The
government immediately appealed.
   The public has a right to know about matters of such interest
and importance, U.S. Magistrate Joseph Reichmann said in ruling on
requests by the Los Angeles Times, the Copley Newspapers chain and
NBC.
   ``We are talking about the foundations of our country, the
defense of our country,'' Reichmann said.
   The documents in question are affidavits filed in support of
search warrants. In the court papers, investigators set out the
wrong they believe has been done and what they seek in their
searches.
   The warrants were used June 13 to search the offices of Northrop
Corp., Teledyne Industries, Litton Industries and the home of
defense consultant Fred Lackner. They were among 33 search warrants
executed across the country that day.
   At the request of U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner, Reichmann delayed
the unsealing until 2 p.m. The government then said it was
appealing the ruling to U.S. District Judge David Kenyon, who
scheduled a hearing for 2 p.m.
   Bonner had argued that disclosure of the affidavits would alert
targets of the investigation and might encourage them to destroy
documents. He also contended that the First Amendment right of
access applies only after a defendant has been arrested or indicted.
   The investigation, which became public last month, centers on
allegations that defense industry consultants bribed Pentagon
officials for inside information useful in winning win
multimillion-dollar contracts.
   If Reichmann's order stands, Los Angeles would be the third
city, after St. Louis and Dallas, in which sealed documents
detailing aspects of the probe were made public.
   In Alexandria, Va., today, a U.S. District judge rejected a
similar unsealing request by attorneys for consultant Melvyn
Paisley, a former assistant Navy secretary who is a key figure in
the probe. Paisley's home and office were searched.
   Reichmann adopted the position argued by attorney Rex Heincke,
representing the Times, who said the outpouring of publicity on the
defense fraud probe in the last month makes the sealing unwarranted.
   ``It's important that these people that want to know, this small
band of people that read the papers, can feel they have some say to
check up on what people in all three parcels of our government are
doing,'' Reichmann said.
   The magistrate said citizens are entitled to ask, ``are we just
throwing our money away when we buy these defense programs?''
   ``Corruption, bribery, these are things that go to the heart of
how our government functions,'' he said.
   Reichmann disclosed that one of the affidavits has been
misplaced by the court clerk's office ``for no sinister reason''
and may not be available.
   Lackner's attorney, William Dougherty, had also urged at the
hearing today that the affidavits be unsealed to allow him to
properly defend his client, who he said has been ``effectively put
out of business'' by the seizure of all his business records.

<HEAD>Iranians Attack Tanker Near Farsi Island</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Speedboats attacked a tanker that passed
within five miles of the Iran's Farsi Island military stronghold
Friday, but the ship escaped with minor damage as an American
missile frigate raced to its aid.
   ``No assistance was required'' when the Robert G. Bradley
reached the 85,989-ton Sea Victory in international waters, a U.S.
Navy spokesman said.
   ``She went within five miles of Farsi and they came out to get
her,'' he said. ``She turned tail and ran straight out. They went
back home and left her alone.''
   U.S. officials said the warship could not have defended the
tanker close to the island because Navy ``rules of engagement''
allow intervention only in international waters and the United
States recognizes a 12-mile limit around Farsi.
   Shipping executives said Iran is preparing a new oil platform in
the southern Persian Gulf equipped with facilities that suggest
military purposes, possibly defensive, as well as civilian.
   A radio report from the Liberian-registered tanker's Greek
captain said the speedboats attacked three times, making ``lots of
holes,'' starting a small fire and slightly wounding the first mate.
   It was the second attack in three days near Farsi in the
northern Persian Gulf. Iranian Revolutionary Guards use the island
60 miles off Saudi Arabia as a base for attacks on neutral
commercial shipping from speedboats armed with machine guns and
grenade launchers.
   Attacks in the area have increased recently after months of
comparative calm. Gulf shipping executives said the Iranian raids
apparently were reprisals for two Iraqi air raids on Iranian
tankers last week.
   Iraq raids tankers owned or chartered by Iran in an attempt to
stop the oil exports with which its enemy finances the 8-year-old
war, and Iran responds with attacks on ships trading with gulf Arab
states. More than 500 ships have been attacked by both sides.
   U.S. helicopters and Iranian speedboats exchanged fire Tuesday
after the boats attacked a Panamanian-registered tanker west of
Farsi. U.S. pilots said one boat may have been damaged.
   On Friday, the Sea Victory was bound for Kuwait when speedboats
attacked at about 2 p.m., and the captain issued a distress call.
   The Bradley, on patrol 25 miles away, replied and sped toward
the reported location. When the two vessels met less than an hour
later, the fire was out and the Sea Victory was in no danger, the
Navy spokesman said.
   ``There was no involvement of U.S. forces with the gunboats and
no U.S. helicopters entered territorial waters. We do not violate
territorial waters of any country,'' he said.
   Although military officials said the distress message was a
``general Mayday call,'' shipping executives quoted radio monitors
as saying the tanker asked ``American warships'' for help. The
informants said later the captain shouted, ``We want the navy! We
want the helicopters to chase them away!''
   Under the broader ``rules of engagement'' that took effect two
months ago, U.S. warships may intervene in attacks on ships of
non-U.S. registry if they request help, are not connected wth
either of the belligerents and are in international waters.
   Before that, the Navy could offer armed protection only to
U.S.-flag ships.
   Shipping executives who mentioned the new Iranian oil platform
said any military role might be strictly defensive.
   The platform, under construction in a port on the Arab side of
the gulf, will have electronic gear, radar and landing pads to
handle three helicopters at once, and steel plating, apparently to
protect it from attack, the executives said.
   They quoted Iranian officials as saying it would be an
administrative base for Iran's fleet of shuttle tankers delivering
oil to the Larak Island export terminal in the Strait of Hormuz.
The informants spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Iran has used oil platforms as military communications bases and
U.S. forces demolished three, one last October and two on April 18,
in retaliation for attacks on ships and helicopters.
   ABC television said equipment being installed on this platform
could make it an offshore base ``capable of coordinating sea and
airborne attacks upon the U.S. Navy.''
   Some shipping executives agreed it could monitor traffic and be
a base for speedboat or helicopter raids, but were skeptical that
its main purpose was military.
   ``The term armor-plated is exaggerated,'' one said. ``They are
reinforcing it with steel, but they are not turning it into a
tank.''
   He said it probably would have anti-aircraft guns to help
protect Larak from Iraqi air raids.

<HEAD>GOP Candidate and Treasury Secretary Vacation in Wyoming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the eve of the Democratic National
Convention, Republican George Bush and his chief political mentor,
Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, are going fishing.
   Whether the two plan to spend 4{ days in the wilds of Wyoming
also casting for a prospective GOP running mate, Bush aides aren't
saying. But, the aides suggest, draw your own conclusions on what
the talk may turn to when the fish aren't biting.
   The vice president and Baker leave for Wyoming on Saturday, and
will remain there until Wednesday morning. Then, Bush plans to hit
the campaign trail hard, with events scheduled during the final two
days of the Democratic convention _ a break with tradition _ and on
through the next weekend.
   Sources said the two will be fly fishing in the Shoshone
National Forest in northest Wyoming _ which covers a lot of
territory.
   Campaign spokeswoman Sheila Tate says she has no idea where Bush
and Baker will be. The closest town, she said, is Cody.
   ``You're looking at someone with zero knowledge,'' said Ms.
Tate, who says she think she's being kept purposely in the dark on
Bush's whereabouts. ``It's the last chance he'll have in many years
to have a few days of normal vacation. He deserves it,'' she said.
   Normal vacation it isn't.
   Besides having with him the man soon expected to become his
campaign chairman, Bush will be taking along a small Secret Service
contingent and communications officers to keep him in touch with
the White House.
   And, because it's deemed an ``official'' vacation rather than a
campaign trip, taxpayers will be picking up the tab for the flight
out on Air Force Two.
   Bush aides also say there'll be a forest ranger along as a guide.
   ``He's the vice president of the United States and he will be in
touch if he needs to be,'' said vice presidential aide Stephen
Hart. ``He's not going to drop off the face of the earth.''
   Bush and Baker are not taking their wives on the vacation.
Barbara Bush will spend most of the time at the Bush's seacoast
retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   ``Happy campers are all boys,'' Ms. Tate said.
   It will be a change of pace for Bush, who does most of his
fishing in the Atlantic Ocean in his 27-foot powerboat off
Kennebunkport. ``He is in a great mood at the prospect of
reaquainting himself with fly fishing techniques,'' Ms. Tate said.
   Baker is a longtime friend and political adviser to Bush. He ran
Bush's 1980 presidential campaign and was senior counsel to the
1984 Reagan-Bush re-election campaign.
   Bush campaign sources say they expect Baker to resign as
treasury secretary to join the Bush campaign as its senior
official, most likely in early August, just before the Republican
convention.
   Although the two administration officials themselves have been
tight-lipped on specific plans, Bush makes it no secret that he
already relies on Baker unofficially for campaign advice. Baker
does not dispute this. ``I return my telephone calls,'' Baker said
in a recent interview.
   There had been speculation that Bush and Baker would be staying
at a cabin near Cody, Wyo., on the South Fork of the Shoshone River
owned by Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., a close friend of Bush's and
among those mentioned as a possible running mate.
   However, Simpson spokeswoman Mary Kay Hill said Friday that the
vice president would not be staying there and that Simpson had no
plans to join the fishing trip.
   Bush will reappear on Wednesday, the next-to-last night of the
Democratic convention, with two campaign apperances planned in the
the Detroit area. And on Thursday, the day when Dukakis will
deliver his acceptance speech, Bush dips into the South with
campaign events planned in Charlotte, N.C. and Greenville, S.C.
   That will break a longstanding tradition in which presidential
contenders have ceased political activity during the rival party's
nominating convention.
   Bush plans to campaign in Wisconsin and New Jersey the following
day and in Tennessee and Florida July 23. He will address a
business and professional womens' convention in Albuquerque, N.M.,
on July 24.

<HEAD>Superconductivity Products For Sale Within 3 Years, Expert Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Products using superconductivity may appear on
the market within three years, but it will take a decade or more
for major applications of the technology, a prominent researcher
said Friday.
   Paul C. W. Chu of the University of Houston commented in an
interview after President Reagan awarded him and 19 other
researchers the national medal of science. Reagan also awarded the
national medal of technology to 10 prominent leaders in the
technical industries.
   Chu, cited in the award description for a series of discoveries
that helped raise the temperature of superconductive materials,
said the new technology probably will be on the market in the form
of special batteries and smoke detectors within two to three years.
   Microelectronics, electrical switches and other thin film
electrical connectors will probably benefit from superconductivity
within five years, Chu said.
   ``But any large scale application is at least 10 years away,''
he said. He predicted that by the end of the century
superconductivity technology will be applied to the transmission of
electricty and in large magnets.
   Superconductivity is a material state that permits electricity
to flow without resistance. For decades, this was thought to occur
only in metals chilled to temperatures approaching absolute zero:
minus 459.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
   But Chu and other researchers, experimenting with ceramic
compounds, have discovered how to raise the minimum
superconductivity temperature to about inus 243 degrees, a
temperature easily maintained with relatively inexpensive liquid
nitrogen.
   Experts believe the technology will permit the manufacture of
large, powerful magnets that could be used in transportation and
medicine. The technology also could substantially reduce the cost
of electricity since about half of generated power is lost to
transmission resistance. Also, superconductivity could speed up
computers and permit the more efficient storage of electricity.
   Chu said many nations now are racing to develop
superconductivity technology and it is not clear who has the lead.
He said he could not predict which nation would make the first
practical application of the new technology, but ``I am very
impressed by the Japanese effort.''
   Reagan, in presenting the medals, said it is vital that the
United States continue to promote research into emerging
technologies that will have a major influence on life in the future.
   The president praised the medal winners as the ``men and women
who are leading us into the new age of technology'' and that one of
the most important jobs of government is ``knocking down the
barriers of progress.''
   ``America's greatest resource is not the land,'' he said. ``No,
America's greatest resource is the genius of our people.''
   Reagan gave 20 researchers the national medal of science, an
honor established by Congress in 1959 to recognize achievements in
physical, biological, mathematical, behavioral, social or
engineering sciences.
   In addition to Chu, those receiving the science medal were
Joseph L. Goldstein and Michael S. Brown of the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas; William O. Baker of Bell
Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J.; Konrad E. Bloch,
Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.; D. Allan Bromley, Yale
University, New Haven, Conn.;
   Stanley N. Cohen, Stanford University, Stanford, Calif.; Elias
J. Corey, Harvard; Daniel C. Drucker, University of Florida,
Gainesville, Fla.; Milton Friedman, Stanford; Ralph E. Gomory, IBM,
Armonk, N.Y.; Willis M. Hawkins, Lockheed Corp., Calabasas, Calif.;
Maurice R. Hilleman, Merck and Co., West Point, Pa.; George W.
Housner, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif;
   Eric R. Kandel, Columbia University and the New York State
Psychiatric Institute, New York, N.Y.; Joseph B. Keller, Stanford;
Walter Kohn, University of California, Santa Barbara; Norman F.
Ramsey, Harvard; Jack Steinberger, European Center for Nuclear
Research, Geneva, Switzerland, and Rosalyn S. Yalow, Mt. Sinai
School of Medicine, New York, N.Y.
   The 10 winners of the national medal of technology named by
Reagan were Edwin H. Land, founder of the Polaroid Corp. and now
president of the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge, Mass.;
John L. Atwood, Rockwell International Corp., El Segundo, Calif.;
Arnold O. Beckman, Beckman Instruments, Irvine, Calif.; Paul M.
Cook, Raychem Corp., Menlo Park, Calif.;
   Richard H. Dennard, IBM, Yorktown Heights, N.Y.; Harold E.
Edgerton, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge;
Clarence L. Johnson, Lockheed; David Packard, Hewlett-Packard Co.,
Palo Alto, Calif.; Raymond Damadian, FONAR Corp., Melville, N.Y.,
and Paul C. Lauterbur, University of Illinois at Urbana.
   The technology medal was created in 1980 by Congress to
recognize those who advance American technology and improved the
nation's economy, environment or social well-being.

<HEAD>Tass: Afghan Rebel Rockets Kill 20 In Kabul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan rebels fired more than 20 rockets into
residential areas of Kabul on Friday, killing 20 people, wounding
34 and damaging a mosque and other buildings in the Afghanistan
capital, the Tass news agency reported.
   The 5:30 a.m. attack, which Tass denounced as ``barbarous'' and
a ``crime,'' was the latest reported on a major population center
in Afghanistan. Fighting has spread throughout the rugged and
mountainous country as the Soviets withdraw their troops.
   Radio Kabul also reported the attack on residential areas of the
Afghan capital. The dispatch was monitored in Islamabad, Pakistan.
   However, Afghan guerrilla leader Abdul Haq told The Associated
Press in Islamabad the insurgents do not target residential
neighborhoods. He said the 15 to 20 rebel targets in Kabul, which
include the airport and Soviet Embassy, are not residential areas.
   Haq claimed Afghan government troops and their Soviet backers
fire rockets into Kabul's residential districts to discredit the
guerrillas and undermine their burgeoning popular support.
   ``We fire five rockets, and suddenly, we see 20 hit,'' Haq said,
disavowing responsibility for all bombardments in Kabul.
   Tass said it was ``monstrous'' to suggest Soviet forces would
fire on a city they still occupied and said one of the 21 rockets
launched on four Kabul neighborhoods Friday exploded next to the
Soviet Embassy. A label on one undetonated missile showed it came
from Egypt, Tass said.
   Afghan President Najib, speaking to members of the armed forces,
said Wednesday the insurgents have become bolder as Soviet troops
depart. Under an accord signed April 14 in Geneva, the Kremlin
committed itself to begin withdrawing its more than 100,000 troops
on May 15, and to complete the pullout by Feb. 15. Half of the
Soviet soldiers are to be home by August.
   ``More than 35,000 Soviet internationalists have returned to
their country,'' Najib said in a speech broadcast by official Kabul
radio and monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp.
   However, Najib said: ``Armed interference in the internal
affairs of our country ... is not only continuing, but has
intensified. ... The extremists engage in savage crimes against
peaceful people.''
   Tass said villages in the provinces of Paktia, Paktika and Kunar
were heavily bombarded by the insurgents Thursday and that at least
five people, including three children, were killed.
   Radio Kabul said a land mine planted by guerrillas exploded
Thursday in a crowded bazaar in Rodat, 30 miles from the border
with Pakistan. Two people were killed and one injured.
   More than 150 civilians were reported killed last weekend when
the anti-Marxist rebels, aided by the United States, used artillery
and rockets to shell populated areas in more than eight provinces.
   On July 8, a car packed with explosives blew up near a downtown
movie theater in the eastern city of Jalalabad, killing 31 people
and injuring 33 others, Soviet and Afghan media said.
   The Soviet withdrawal places the burden of warfare on the Afghan
army, a force many Western observers believe will be unable to
withstand the guerrillas. Tass, however, said Afghan troops had
staged several ``successful operations'' against the rebels
recently.
   It said the army wiped out an insurgent detachment of more than
20 fighters and captured three people who planned to commit
``terrorist acts'' near the southern city of Kandahar.
   Afghanistan's official Bakhtar news agency reported that about
100 anti-government guerrillas were killed in the past week and
that large quantities of weapons were seized, including rocket
launchers, mortars, machine guns, grenade launchers and three
U.S.-made Stinger missiles, Tass said.
   Soviet and Afghan officials maintain they are abiding by the
U.N.-brokered accords on Afghanistan. They have used increasingly
tough language in accusing Pakistan, which is also a signatory, of
blatant violations.
   In particular, the Soviets say Pakistan is allowing its
territory to be used to supply the rebels with weapons and
ammunition and as the home of a rival Afghan government. State-run
Radio Moscow accused Pakistan on Friday of ``crude violations'' of
the Geneva accords.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Vadim P. Perfilyev, told
a government news briefing Thursday the Kremlin may reconsider its
obligations under the agreements if the violations by Pakistan
continue.
   However, he shied away from mentioning any potential Soviet
reaction.
   The commander of Soviet forces in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. Boris
Gromov, said in a newspaper interview published Sunday that the
violations could force his country to reconsider the withdrawal
timetable.
   The Kremlin sent tanks and troops into Afghanistan in December
1979 to preside over the replacement of one Marxist leader by
another. The Soviets stayed on to fight the guerrillas in a brutal
war in which more than 13,000 Red Army soldiers lost their lives.

   Jesse Jackson avoided stirring new
controversy between himself and Michael Dukakis Friday as his
``Rainbow Express'' caravan rolled South, leaving ripples of
attention along the highways.
   The caravan, bound for next week's Democratic National
Convention, included seven buses and an equal number of cars.
Inside were about 120 reporters and photographers, 30 or so
supporters and about a dozen delegates, staffers said.
   They arrived in Lousiville at mid-day for Jackson to have lunch
at an inner-city church. As he entered, Jackson ignored shouted
questions from reporters about a possible meeting with Dukakis.
   He planned rallies in Louisville and in Nashville, Tenn., Friday
night.
   Construction workers stared curiously at the buses festooned
with banners and posters, and knots of people gathered each time
the motorcade swept into a city.
   At rallies along the way, Jackson focused on mobilizing his
supporters, though the Atlanta convention is sure to nominate
Dukakis for president and Dukakis' choice of Lloyd Bentsen for vice
president. Jackson battled Dukakis for the presidential nomination
for months, then lobbied for the No. 2 slot.
   In the midst of a tense, week-long focus on relations between
the Jackson and Dukakis camps, Jackson concentrated on the
Republicans and their expected nominee, George Bush.
   ``We survived Reagan, we can survive anything,'' Jackson said.
``We're getting ready to send Bush back into private life.''
   In meetings with reporters, Jackson said he'll meet with Dukakis
``at an appropriate time.'' Former President Carter could help
mediate ``at the appropriate time.''
   For the moment, Jackson seemed content to work on his convention
speech and prepare for a showy arrival in Atlanta on Saturday.
   His was the first bus in the caravan, equipped with a kitchen.
He was accompanied by his children and advisers.
   Wife, Jackie, was helping prepare for his arrival.
   ``She was wise enough to fly to Atlanta,'' Jackson said.
   ``We're not picking up passengers; we're registering,'' Jackson
said. ``Because of travel time, we're not encouraging additional
passengers.''
   Jackson did draw distinctions between the credentials of an
anointed leader of the party, and his own role.
   ``I may never get the leader label,'' Jackson said. ``But
leaders have followers and support.''
   ``When I look at those who have been to the White House and
those who are trying to go ... I may or may not get there, but I'm
qualified,'' Jackson said.

<HEAD>Reagan Says His Greatest Achievement Was Staying Alive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Looking back on nearly eight years as president,
Ronald Reagan said with a short, dry laugh that his greatest
achievement may have been staying alive.
   The 77-year-old U.S. chief executive, who was shot in the chest
in 1981, commented in the second of a three-part series on his
presidency broadcast Friday on British television's independent
Channel 4.
   David Gergen, former White House spokesman, said the public
attitude toward Reagan changed after the assassination attempt.
   ``You may not agree with him. You may think he's too simple .. .
not a man of the world, but there is a sense of conviction about
him,'' Gergen said. ``A strength of character emerges in the
shooting which transforms his presence.''
   The 50-minute program called ``Walking Tall'' covers Reagan's
first term.
   It starts with former aide Michael Deaver recalling that he
found his boss sleeping under a mound of bedcovers on the morning
of his inauguration, Jan. 20, 1981.
   ``I said, `Governor.' There was kind of a grunt,'' Deaver said.
``And I said `Good God, in an hour and a half you're going to be
sworn in as the 40th president of the United States.' He rolled
over and said, `Do I have to?'.''
   Much of the program focused on assessments by political analysts
and former members of Reagan's administration.
   To Howard Baker, former White House chief of staff, ``Ronald
Reagan is the most presidential man I've ever known. That will be
his principal legacy. And by that I mean he knows exactly who he
is. He is president of the United States and he has no trouble with
that. He is not offended by it, upset by it or intimidated by it.''
   Stuart Spencer, a long-time adviser, said: ``Nobody in American
politics has better style and form than Ronald Reagan.''
   Howard Philips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus political
group, called him ``the most typical, the most American, the most
average _ but in a good sense, in a likeable sense _ president we
could ever imagine.''
   The president's policies of increasing defense spending, cutting
social programs and refusing to raise taxes came in for tough
criticism.
   Reagan was asked how he responded to the fact that he never
balanced the budget and the United States now is the world's
biggest debtor nation.
   ``I'm just as critical of it as I was before I got here,'' he
replied.
   Donald Regan, former treasury secretary and chief of staff, said
the president never discussed economics or finance with him. Regan
said Congress made budget cuts almost impossible.
   David Stockman, the former budget director who urged Reagan to
raise taxes, had a harsh assessment:
   ``After time, when the full extent of the damage is clear, and
the heavy price we will pay for years to come is evident,
historians will record Reaganomics as the singular greatest episode
of sustained economic mismanagement in the 20th century history of
the United States.''
   Regan called that ``sour grapes on the part of David Stockman''
and added: ``He never got what he wanted, which was solely to have
taxes raised. ... That was not an antidote to get us out of
recession'' in 1982.
   Some of the first term's major events were shown, including the
assassination attempt, the October 1983 bombing of a U.S. Marine
barracks in Beirut that killed 243 military personnel and the
invasion of Grenada two days later.
   Recalling the assassination attempt, Reagan said: ``I heard what
I thought was firecrackers. ... I didn't feel a bullet hit me.''
   When asked what was his greatest achievement, he said:
``Sometimes I think,'' then laughed and continued, ``just staying
alive.''
   Even Reagan's critics praised his ability to control the media.
   ``These people have understood that they have a powerful
instrument of news management in their hand,'' said Richard
Neustadt, a Harvard University professor and author of
``Presidential Power,'' who described Reagan's mastery of the photo
opportunity and disdain of formal news conferences.

   Anyone looking for the RCA Building entrance on
Sixth Avenue next year is in for some confusion.
   They changed the name of Sixth Avenue to the Avenue of the
Americas years ago; early next year, they're changing the name of
the RCA Building, the 70-story landmark in the center of
Rockefeller Center, to the G.E. Building.
   General Electric purchased RCA and its network television
division, NBC, two years ago. The building is the network's
headquarters, and has carried the RCA name for more than five
decades.
   In a memo to employees Wednesday, NBC President Robert Wright
said the company intended ``to change the name of the building and
the signage to the G.E. Building, to reflect our current
ownership.''
   ``It seems sort of the obvious evolution of things,'' said NBC
spokeswoman Betty Hudson. The building is owned by Rockefeller
Center, but General Electric has the right to change the name.
   Five blocks away, there is another landmark building known as
the General Electric Building. It was once known as the RCA Victor
Building before G.E. moved in in 1933.

<HEAD>Military Administration Cuts West Bank School Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military administration said Friday it
would end the school year in the occupied West Bank in a week, and
Arab students complained they would lose a month of studies and
fail their final exams.
   Also Friday, a United Nations official blamed prolonged army
curfews and Palestinian commercial strikes for cash shortages in
the occupied Gaza Strip.
   The official, who requested anonymity, also reported problems in
the delivery of food supplies to Gaza's refugee camps. But he said
no one was going hungry in the strip, where 650,000 Palestinians
live.
   In another development, an 18-year-old Arab was wounded in the
leg during a clash with soldiers in Gaza's Bureij camp, a local
reporter said. The army said it was not aware of the incident.
   A spokesman for the Israeli military administration in the West
Bank said the school year would end on July 21, with final exams
likely to begin Saturday.
   Palestinian students said the step would chop a month off the
school year and give them no time to study for their exams. They
said the school year had been scheduled to end in mid-August.
   But the military spokesman, Olivier Rafovitz, said the dates in
August had only been tentative. He said the measure was not
political but ``a purely technical decision.''
   At the height of the Arab uprising in February, the army closed
800 West Bank schools, claiming they were major centers of
Palestinian unrest. The schools were reopened in a three-stage
procedure ending June 6.
   Since the reopening, the military administration ordered several
dozen schools closed until the end of the school year. It also kept
280,000 Palestinian students in the West Bank out of school for a
week after student riots.
   Arab students said the new measure meant they would fail their
exams.
   ``There is no time to study. If we go for exams, nobody would
pass,'' said Issam Ismaeel, 18, of Bethlehem High School. ``They
are trying to pressure us and it's clear they are after our
failure.''
   A curfew on Nablus, the largest West Bank city with 120,000 Arab
residents, entered its fourth day Friday.
   Curfews also continued in the town of Qalqilya, the vilage of
Beit Sahur and the Aida refugee camp near Bethlehem, and two other
West Bank villages. In Beit Sahur, villagers have been confined to
their homes for eight days.
   A U.N. relief official said prolonged curfews in Gaza have
caused financial shortages. He cited a 15-day curfew imposed last
month on the Bureij camp after its Arab municipality resigned in
response to threats from leaders of the 7-month-old Arab uprising.
   Since the uprising began in December, 222 Palestinians and four
Israelis have been killed.
   The official also blamed a six-week ban on Gazans leaving for
work in Israel and Arab-ordered commercial strikes for the economic
difficulties.
   The official said the army was letting U.N. relief trucks
deliver basic food supplies to the camps, and said there was no
real food shortage. ``What you've got is shortages of money,'' he
said.
   The Israeli daily Haaretz, however, quoted an Israeli reserve
trooper Friday as saying: ``In the past few days I have given out
watermelons, cantaloupes and some even come and beg me for bread.
We know there is a severe food shortage in the camps.''

Their Welfare</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gov. Arch Moore ceremoniously snipped a
ribbon Friday to open the last 36-mile link of interstate highway
system in his state, but businesses on a competing road say the new
route spells disaster for them.
   After two decades of delay, the completed stretch of Interstate
64 between Sam Black Church and Beckley creates 1,125 miles of
continuous four-lane travel from Norfolk, Va., to St. Louis.
   The new road should shave an hour off the travel time between
Charleston and White Sulphur Springs, in the southeastern part of
the state, reducing the trip to 1{ hours.
   At the opening ceremony, Moore called the $313.5 million link a
``monument to progress.''
   But for businesses along a 190-stretch of two-lane U.S. 60,
which has been southern West Virginia's lifeline for decades, I-64
can only mean a drastic drop in travelers.
   ``I think it'll be really disastrous,'' said Pat Rogers, who
works at Pioneer Village Country Store in Chimney Corner, 45 miles
east of Charleston.
   ``Given a choice, I don't think anyone will drive (U.S.) 60,''
Rogers said. ``You can be there for days.''
   U.S. 60 snakes over and around steep mountains, and the narrow
lanes are crowded by coal-truck convoys that often slow traffic to
15 or 20 mph.
   The 2{-hour trip from Charleston to Lewisburg on the Virginia
border is ``white-knuckle driving,'' state Department of Highways
spokesman John Gallagher said.
   The state expects a sharp decline in attendance at Hawks Nest
and Babcock state parks, along U.S. 60.
   ``I'm convinced that there will be an impact, and that it will
not be a positive one,'' said state Commerce Commissioner Robert
Trocin.
   But officials are hoping that the drop in visitors to the parks
will be more than offset by the expected boost I-64 will have in
the tourism economy of the depressed southern counties, now heavily
dependent on coal.
   They estimate that I-64 will increase the number of travelers on
the interstate system in southern West Virginia by 20 to 40 percent.
   ``We will see an influx of commercial building and development
that hasn't been available to us before,'' said Beckley-Raleigh
County Chamber of Commerce President Bill Wilbur.
   As originally planned, I-64 would have run along U.S. 60's
route. In the mid-1960s, however, the route was changed to protect
wetlands and to shorten the road, causing years of construction
delays. Instead of running directly from Lewisburg to Charleston,
it now runs to Beckley, 51 miles south of the capital.
   Friday's dedication took place on the east end of the $29
million Glade Creek Bridge on a platform festooned with red, white
and blue balloons. Joining Moore were former Govs. Hulett Smith and
Okey Patteson and the state's two U.S. senators and four
congressmen.
   The Department of Highways estimated the turnout at 10,000 but
Moore put the figure at 50,000. Traffic was backed up for several
miles in the broiling sun as motorists and spectators waited for
the dignitaries to snip the ribbon and open the road to traffic.

   Actress Jenny Seagrove, who recently starred in
the TV miniseries ``A Woman of Substance,'' was granted a divorce
Friday from a man the judge said trapped her in an emotional web
and made her totally dependent on him.
   Divorce Court Judge Clive Callman said actor Madhav Sharma had
failed to become a star in his own right, exercised a hypnotic
power over his 30-year-old wife and used her success to force
himself into the limelight.
   He said Sharma, 47, ``has an extraordinary, almost hypnotic
power over people and was Svengali to Jenny Seagrove'' for half
their four-year marriage.
   Callman dismissed as ``totally misconceived'' Sharma's
countersuit for a judicial separation in which he accused Ms.
Seagrove of adultery.
   Ms. Seagrove came to fame as the mysterious diver in the hit
Scottish movie ``Local Hero.''

   A friend of Prince Charles who broke
both legs in an avalanche that narrowly missed the prince returned
to England on Friday after a four-month hospital stay.
   Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson, walking on crutches, was released
from Davos hospital and flew home from Zurich accompanied by her
husband, Charles.

   What could comedian Jay Leno and
millionaire publisher Malcolm Forbes possibly have in common?
   Money? Senses of humor?
   But it was their love of motorcycles that brought them together
Thursday night at Caesars Palace.
   Forbes, who publishes Forbes magazine, stopped in Las Vegas
while on an 1,800-mile motorcycle ride from his Colorado ranch to
Los Angeles.
   The millionaire is scheduled to appear as Leno's guest on the
``Tonight Show'' in Burbank on Monday night.
   Forbes first appeared on the show as Leno's guest in 1985, and
the two have become friends. Both share an interest in motorcycles,
and they drew a crowd when they checked out the cycles used by
Forbes and his seven-person entourage on their cross-country ride.
   The 69-year-old Forbes said he began riding a motorcycle 21
years ago.
   He joked that he had a ``deprived childhood'' and didn't get a
motorcycle until he was 48.

   Buster Poindexter has it good: His act is on
tour, he appears in a widely seen liqueur ad, his song ``Hot Hot
Hot'' has hit the charts, and he even has a role in an upcoming
movie with Bill Murray.
   The permanently tuxedoed Buster Poindexter, who is an alter-ego
created by former rock star David Johansen of the flamboyant New
York Dolls, is thriving in his lounge-lizard character.
   For his nightclub act he draws on Gilbert and Sullivan, Patti
Page, Muddy Waters, Archie Bell and plenty of singers from the
1920s through the '40s.
   ``When the Beastie Boys came out, I thought they were the
hippest band since the Dolls. They were saying the same thing we
were _ I am somebody,'' Johansen said.
   Murray saw Poindexter's act and got Johansen a role as the Ghost
of Christmas Past in the movie ``Scrooged,'' to be released at
Christmastime. The credits will roll his real name.
   In addition to a new album and the success of ``Hot Hot Hot,''
Poindexter also is a star of an Amaretto advertisement. He was
approached when he became a semiregular on ``Saturday Night Live.''
Soon the ``Amaretto di Buster'' ad was splashed all over magazines.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary has asked U.S. experts for help
in a controversial, multi-billion dollar hydroelectric dam project
on the Danube river, the official news agency MTI reported Friday.
   The news agency said the government is consulting San
Francisco-based Bechtel Group Inc. about the dam's operation and
the likely environmental consequences of its construction.
   The Gabcikovo-Nagymaros dam on the Hungarian-Czechoslovak border
has pitted the communist government against environmentalists who
say the project and its 140-mile rerouting of the Danube will flood
fertile farmland and destroy natural forests and wildlife.
   Hungarian and Austrian environmentalists oppose the project.
Czechoslovak scientists also questioned the environmental
consequences of the project.
   Construction began in early 1980s and a completion date has been
pushed back several times. Government officials hope to complete
the project by 1990.
   Seventy percent of the construction work in Hungary will be
carried out by Austrian companies in exchange for 15 years of
electricity for Austria from the finished project.
   The new openness evident in Hungary's state-run media and
politics in the past six weeks prompted unprecedented public
coverage of environmentalists' complaints about the planned dam and
raised questions about halting construction.
   Similar vast projects in the Soviet Union were halted in the
past two years as Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
increased openness brought more attention to environmental
questions and catastrophes.
   In June, parliamentarian Zoltan Kiraly proposed that work on the
project be suspended while a team of foreign experts evaluated its
economic efficiency.
   His proposal for suspension was rejected, but word that the
government plans to consult Bechtel Corp. indicated it is now
willing to bring in foreign experts.
   The government is to report to the Parliament on the project in
the fall.
   Officials maintain that stopping construction would cost about
$1.1 billion in payments to Austria, Czechoslovakia and Hungarian
companies for breach of contract.
   Officials estimate the cost of completing the dam at $1.08
billion. Environmentalists contend inflation will push costs to
$2.6 billion.
   MTI quoted Ervin Zsuffa, deputy minister of environment and
water management, as saying the Bechtel study should examine
environmental aspects of the project so that water and energy
management could be adjusted accordingly.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says Carter Not Needed as Mediator</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Tops with 8 grafs to update with Dukakis, Jackson comments,
picking up in 2nd graf pvs, As Jackson</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>

   Michael Dukakis today dismissed as unnecessary Jesse Jackson's
proposal for former President Carter to act as a mediator between
their two campaigns.
   ``We don't need mediators,'' the nominee-to-be said in an
interview in the governor's office in Boston.
   Dukakis said he and Jackson talked eariler today, but he refused
to discuss the substance of the conversation.
   Asked if he expected Jackson's name to be offered to the
convention for the vice presidential nomination, Dukakis said he
didn't know.
   In Louisville, Jackson declined to discuss the phone call except
in general terms.
   ``Clearly, the governor understands the steps that are now
necessary for unity and partnership to be achieved,'' he said.
   Asked if he would allow his name to be put into nomination
Thursday night for vice president, Jackson replied: ``That's really
a moot question.''
   Dukakis' rejection of the mediation proposal came after
Democratic Party chief Paul Kirk dismissed the idea and aides to
Jackson also expressed doubts about it.
   As Jackson left Indianapolis today on the second day of his bus
trip to Atlanta and next week's national convention, his convention
manager Ron Brown said the tension between the campaigns ``isn't a
question of personal pique or personal relationships.''
   ``It's a question of equity. It's a question of partnership,''
Brown said on ``CBS This Morning.''
   Dukakis insisted Thursday he has a good relationship with
Jackson, even as his remaining rival asked Carter to help resolve
``the creative tensions'' between them.
   Kirk disagreed with Jackson.
   ``I don't think, in my view, that the fact that there has been
some miscommunication at this point requires the president of the
United States to come to the table,'' Kirk said on CBS. ``I think
that Ron and his counterpart, Susan Estrich ... ought to come to
the table within the next several hours, talk over the issues, get
the platform discussions back on track and be ready for a real
celebration of unity here as we prepare for the fall campaign.''
   Brown said that any role for Carter was ``not clear yet.
Frankly, we've come to no conclusion on that.''
   Bert Lance, the Jackson adviser and former Carter White House
official, said in an interview, ``I'm not sure it's necessary. ...
Mike and Jesse can deal with whatever they have to deal with.''
   However, Lance also said some involvement by Carter could help
Dukakis with Jackson's followers.
   Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, a Jackson supporter, said it
was Lance who came up with the Carter idea, but Lance declined to
confirm that. He was budget director for Carter in the White House.
   ``We will exercise all of our rights,'' Jackson said in Chicago
before joining a seven-bus motorcade. ``It is an open convention.
... We are prepared to deliberate and debate, Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday.''
   Jackson remained indignant over the handling of the selection of
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as Dukakis's running mate.
   ``The Boston-Austin connection leaves Chicago out of the
equation,'' he said. But he also spoke of reconciliation.
   ``We hope in the next three or four days that matters will be
resolved,'' Jackson said at an Indianapolis news conference. He
added that he expected a meeting with Dukakis at ``some appropriate
time.''
   Meanwhile, a new state poll suggested the choice of Bentsen had
helped the Democratic ticket in Texas, adopted home state of
Republican George Bush.
   And Bush took advantage of his status as vice president, going
to the United Nations to defend U.S. actions surrounding the
downing of an Iranian airliner.
   ``I will not dignify with a response the charge that we
deliberately destroyed Iran Air 655,'' Bush told the Security
Council. ``The foreign minister of Iran knows better. He knows that
this tragedy was an accident.''
   It was to be Bush's last public appearance for a week, as he is
scheduled to leave for a six-day fishing trip on Saturday.
   Jackson spent the night in Indianapolis, and his bus caravan was
taking him today to Louisville, Ky., and Nashville, Tenn.
   Dukakis was spending today focusing on state government business
in Boston.
   The Massachusetts governor avoided public questioning on
Jackson, but repeated in a CBS News interview that he had
apologized to Jackson for failing to reach him before news of the
choice of Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as his running mate.
   ``Jesse and I have had a good relations over the past couple of
months and that's going to continue,'' Dukakis said.
   Asked if he expects that television viewers will see Jackson on
the podium for a unity picture on the last night of the convention
next week, Dukakis was optimistic: ``I expect that you will.''
   Campaign aides said efforts were under way to arrange a meeting
between Dukakis and Jackson in Atlanta on Sunday, the day Dukakis
is scheduled to arrive. Jackson's bus trip is slated to wrap up
Saturday afternoon with a big Atlanta rally.
   Jackson raised new possibilities as he began his bus trip,
revealing that he had called Carter early Thursday morning to ask
him to mediate.
   A new NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll nationally gave Dukakis
about a 10-point lead. The survey of 1,695 registered voters July
8-11 gave Dukakis 46 percent, Bush 36 percent. That is a similar
margin to other polls, but five points below the margin found in a
June poll.

<HEAD>Peace Groups Stage Own Convention As Democrats Head For Town</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 70 national and local peace and justice
groups, hoping to influence political policy, began their own
meeting in Atlanta Friday, three days before the Democratic
National Convention gets under way.
   Organizers of the Fannie Lou Hamer Convention plan to create a
``People's Platform'' during their three-day meeting to be sent to
Democratic and Republican national convention delegates.
   The platform will be produced from workshops with such titles as
``Military Counseling and Equal Access to our Youth,'' ``U.S.
Government and the Drug Connection,'' ``Global Struggles for
Self-Determination and Basic Human Rights'' and ``Right Wing
Authoritarianism and the Fascist Mentality.''
   The convention is named after a black Mississippi woman who led
a challenge to that state's all-white delegation to the 1964
Democratic convention.
   The convention is being held in a downtown church, across the
street from the state Capitol where white supremacists are
scheduled to hold a rally Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for white supremacists and minority
activists involved in the Fannie Lou Hamer Convention agreed in
court Friday not to interfere with each other's planned activities
this weekend.
   The settlement in Fulton County Superior Court came in response
to a complaint filed by three activist organizations _ the Center
for Democratic Renewal, the National Rainbow Coalition and LEGAL, a
gay rights group _ and various individuals against the city of
Atlanta, the white supremacist Nationalist Movement and three of
its leaders.
   The complaint asked for a temporary restraining order and a
permanent injunction to prevent the white supremacists from
``parading with weapons, inciting to riot, intimidating,
threatening, harassing or otherwise interfering'' with the rights
of the plaintiffs during simultaneous activities set for Sunday in
downtown Atlanta.
   As the Hamer convention wraps up in a church Sunday, the
Nationalist Movement is set to start a march directly across the
street at the state Capitol.
   Under Friday's agreement, both parties are enjoined from
entering the other's area. This limits the supremacists to the
Capitol grounds and the activists to the church.
   The groups also are ``mutually restrained from making threats of
immediate violence to each other,'' said Janise L. Miller, the
activists' attorney.
   The agreement also limits the size of flagpoles and sign poles
used by the marchers.
   Sam Dickson represented the Nationalist Movement leaders, none
of whom was present. ``I think it's a sensible order,'' he said.
``I think the Garden Club and the Elks Lodge would agree to it.''

<HEAD>Court Rules In Favor Of City In Convention Marches Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city of Atlanta won a ruling from the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday in its dispute with
demonstrators who sought to march on a street adjacent to the
Democratic National Convention site.
   The appeals court noted that the city had given permission for
demonstrators to march within one block of the buildings housing
convention activities.
   ``The visibility of the parade from the actual convention site
is not significantly diminished'' by holding it a block away, the
court said.
   Alternative '88, a coalition of protest groups planning to
demonstrate during next week's convention, had filed suit after the
city refused to allow parades on a section of Marietta Street next
to the Omni Hotel and the Georgia World Congress Center.
   U.S. District Judge Orinda Evans ruled last week that the city
has a ``significant'' government interest in guaranteeing
delegates' access to the convention and therefore was justified in
barring parades on the street from Monday through Thursday.
   The appeals court upheld the lower court ruling.

<TEXT>
   Tammy Bakker defied a request by the PTL
bankruptcy trustee that she not visit certain parts of Heritage
USA, and the trustee says he may have to ban the Bakkers completely
from the religious theme park.
   Mrs. Bakker attended the filming of the ``PTL Today'' television
show Thursday, ignoring M.C. ``Red'' Benton's request that the
evangelical couple ``voluntarily restrict their activities to the
west side of the railroad tracks'' of Heritage USA.
   Jim Bakker's parents live on the grounds west of the tracks, and
Benton said Thursday he did not want to limit the couple's access
to them. The studio Mrs. Bakker visited is east of the tracks.
   The Bakkers moved back to the area recently to mount their drive
to regain control of the PTL ministry, which they lost in 1987 in a
sex-and-money scandal.
   Benton was appointed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to oversee the
sale of Heritage USA property to pay PTL's creditors. A buyer is
expected to be named next month. He said he decided to limit the
Bakkers' access to Heritage USA after several incidents in which he
felt the Bakkers' presence was disruptive.
   In one incident, Mrs. Bakker and Russell DeShields, a drummer in
the PTL band, engaged in a shouting match in front of the studio
audience.
   Benton said PTL's attorneys contacted the Bakkers' attorney,
Ryan Hovis, to ask the couple ``if they were going to deliberately
test me to see what I would do.''
   But Hovis said, ``I don't think that's fair, I don't think it's
right'' for the Bakkers to have to stay away from the ministry they
created.''
   Mrs. Bakker's visit to the studio on Thursday was without
incident, said PTL security chief Gene Ervin. He said she quietly
watched the show and left before it ended.
   ``Everything was nice and calm,'' he said.
   Bakker, meanwhile, said he wished Benton had contacted him about
the matter directly instead of going through attorneys.
   ``I think if Mr. Benton wants to say that he should have the
courtesy to call me or write a letter telling me so,'' Bakker said.
``I'll be glad to notify them. If they want to provide security,
that's fine.''

<HEAD>May Trade Deficit Second Lowest in Nearly Three Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States recorded a $10.9 billion
trade deficit in May, the second smallest imbalance in almost three
years, the government said Friday in a report that sent the dollar
soaring on foreign currency markets.
   The Reagan administration and private economists were in
agreement that the Commerce Department report offered conclusive
proof that the government's efforts to deal with one of the
country's biggest economic problems, a seemingly intractable trade
imbalance, were beginning to show results.
   The May deficit was actually $627 million higher than a revised
April imbalance of $10.3 billion. But the April figure was the
smallest imbalance since a $9.9 billion deficit in August 1985 and
the May deficit was the second smallest imbalance since that time.
   Financial markets, which had been braced for a higher deficit
figure, rallied on the news. The dollar jumped sharply on foreign
exchange markets, rising by almost one cent against the British
pound and nearly one Japanese yen in London trading.
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity noted that for the first
five months of this year, American exports have surged by 31
percent compared with the same period in 1987, reflecting the boom
conditions in American manufacturing brought on by the weaker
dollar.
   ``The merchandise trade figures for May are consistent with the
trend toward a lower trade deficit,'' Verity said. ``The
improvement in the trade balance in the first five months has been
widespread geographically.''
   The administration launched an effort three years ago with major
U.S. allies to devalue the dollar as a way of making American goods
more competitive on overseas markets.
   But the strategy took much longer than expected to bear fruit,
with continued huge deficits fueling protectionist fires in
Congress. Last year, the trade deficit soared to an all-time high
of $170.3 billion.
   For the first five months of this year, however, the deficit is
running at an annual rate of $140.7 billion, a $30 billion
improvement, if it holds for the rest of the year.
   ``There can be no doubt that we have turned the corner in a big
way on our trade deficit,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of
the Boston Co.
   U.S. exports climbed 2.3 percent in May to $26.6 billion, 31
percent higher than a year ago. This increase helped offset a 3.4
percent rise in imports, which climbed to $37.6 billion. The trade
deficit is the difference between imports and exports.
   Part of the increase in imports reflected a higher foreign oil
bill, which jumped 17.7 percent to $3.9 billion in May.
   Analysts said they looked for some further modest improvements
in trade for the rest of the year, with some suggesting that the
deficit would dip below $10 billion in coming months.
   But Bruce Steinberg, an economist with the Merrill Lynch
investment firm, said the bulk of the improvement in trade for this
year has already occurred.
   ``Imports aren't going to be falling because domestic demand is
sufficiently strong to keep that from happening,'' he said.
   The rise in imports in May reflected increases of $1.1 billion
in industrial supplies and smaller rises in imports of capital
goods. Imports of autos fell by $600 million during the month.
Analysts said this provided evidence that the price increases
caused by the weaker dollar were beginning to have an effect on
domestic demand.
   The increase in exports in May reflected a $300 million rise in
agricultural shipments, a $300 million advance in sales of capital
goods and a $100 million rise in sales of American autos and parts
overseas.
   By country, the biggest deficit, as usual, was with Japan, an
imbalance of $4.1 billion, down slightly from the April imbalance
of $4.4 billion. For the first five months of the year, the
Japanese trade imbalance has shrunk by 11 percent over the same
period a year ago.
   The improvement in the deficit with Western Europe has been a
much more substantial 47 percent over the same time period. For
May, the deficit with the European Community totaled $1.9 billion.
   The deficit with Canada, the largest U.S. trading partner, was
$1.1 billion, while the deficit with the newly industrialized
nations of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore was $2.4
billion in May.
   The substantial trade improvement has been a key factor in the
better-than-expected economic growth the nation has enjoyed so far
this year. Boom times in manufacturing helped drop the U.S.
unemployment rate to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in June.
   Many economists believe nearly half of the economy's growth this
year will come from an improving trade performance.

<HEAD>Court Rules Out Probe Into Slaying Of Allende Aide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court rejected a request to
reopen an investigation of the 1976 assassination in Washington of
a Chilean dissident.
   The request was filed by lawyers for the family of the
dissident, Orlando Letelier, and was based on new testimony in a
U.S. court by a former Chilean army major who acknowledged a role
in the killing.
   The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling was made Thursday night and
was published Friday by Santiago newspapers.
   Letelier family lawyers argued that the new investigation was
necessary following testimony before a Washington court by Armando
Fernandez Larios, the army major who surrendered to U.S.
authorities in January 1987 and admitted to being an accomplice in
the killing.
   Letelier and an American aide, Ronni Moffitt, were killed when a
remote-control bomb blew up his car on Sept. 21, 1976, as it
rounded Sheridan Circle on Washington's Embassy Row.
   Letelier, a Socialist and former ambassador and Cabinet minister
under Marxist President Salvador Allende, was a prominent and
influential critic of the right-wing military government of
President Augusto Pinochet.
   Pinochet took power in the 1973 coup that toppled Allende.
   The Supreme Court said in its ruling that Fernandez Larios' U.S.
District Court testimony ``cannot be considered as better
information.''
   It also noted the testimony was made after a plea-bargain
agreement. Plea bargaining is barred by Chilean law.
   In 1978, a Washington court indicted Fernandez Larios and two
other Chilean army officers, all secret police agents, in
connection with the Letelier killing. The Chilean Supreme Court
rejected a U.S. request for the extradition of the three officers,
but last year Fernandez Larios slipped out of the country and
surrendered to American authorities in Washington.
   In 1987, the Reagan administration again called on Chile to hand
over the other two officers, Gen. Manuel Contreras, a former secret
police chief, and a top aide, Col. Pedro Espoinoza. Chile refused.

<HEAD>Wholesale Prices Rise at Moderate Pace in June; Raw Food Prices
Soar</HEAD>

   Wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent
in June, the government said Friday, but analysts saw cause for
worry in the steep, drought-induced climb in raw food prices.
   The Labor Department said the hot, dry weather searing much of
the nation sent prices of unprocessed grain and poultry soaring by
more than 20 percent last month, pushing raw food prices 4.2
percent higher than in May. It was the biggest jump since October
1985.
   Food prices rose a lower, but still substantial, 1.1 percent at
the wholesale level, one step before retail stores. Economists said
that it was only a matter of time before price bulges at earlier
production stages show up on supermarket shelves.
   ``Food price inflation looks like it will be with us for many
months to come,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston
Co. ``The report suggests to me that we remain in the beginning
stages of a potentially spiraling inflationary process with no
relief in sight.''
   Other analysts, however, were less pessimistic, pointing to a
drop in energy prices and generally modest increases in other areas.
   Energy prices fell 1.6 percent, with a 7.1 percent decline in
fuel oil leading the way. Gasoline and natural gas fell 2.4 percent
and 1.0 percent respectively.
   ``That's a real break because the last few times we had
droughts, we also had double-digit increases in energy prices,''
said Michael K. Evans, a private economic consultant in Washington.
   ``Energy prices are heading down for the rest of the summer,''
he said, noting a sharp drop between mid-June and mid-July in the
price of crude oil, to the lowest level in nearly two years.
   Subtracting the effects of volatile food and energy prices,
wholesale prices rose 0.3 percent last month, the same as in May.
Analysts consider this rate a better indication of underlying
inflationary pressures in the economy.

slightly in May to $10.9 billion, up from $10.3 billion in April.
But the imbalance was still the second smallest in almost three
years. Both exports and imports increased.
   _The Federal Reserve Board said production at the nation's
factories, mines and utilities rose a moderate 0.4 percent in June,
the ninth consecutive month without a decline. Production at
utilities surged 2.6 percent, primarily for air conditioning during
the heat wave.
   _Business inventories in May rose a moderate 0.6 percent to
$728.4 billion, held in check by a 0.9 percent jump in sales, the
Commerce Department said. Sales rose to $483.7 billion.
   June wholesale price increases pushed the Labor Department's
Producer Price Index for finished goods to 107.9, meaning that a
selection of goods costing $100 in 1982 cost $107.90 last month, 40
cents more than in May. This calculation is not adjusted for
seasonal variations, as are other calculations in the report.
   If the June price rise held for 12 straight months, the
inflation rate would be 4.6 percent annually, more than double the
2.2 percent rise of 1987.
   For the first half of 1988, prices one step short of retail rose
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.6 percent. Excluding food
and energy, wholesale costs rose at 4.0 percent rate over that
period.
   Although overall wholesale prices rose a modest 0.3 percent in
January and fell 0.2 percent in February, they've been up 0.4
percent or 0.5 percent from March through June.
   The Consumer Price Index, which tracks prices at the retail
level and also includes services and imported goods not in the
wholesale price report, has risen at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 4.4 percent over the first five months of the year, the
same rate as for all of 1987.
   Consumer price figures for June will be released next week.
   Stacy Kottman, an economist with Georgia State University in
Atlanta, said the worst effects of the drought may not be felt by
consumers until late this year because meat prices will initially
come down as farmers slaughter animals rather than pay expensive
feed prices.
   Cattle prices, for example, fell 5.2 percent in June while hog
prices were down 4.0 percent.
   But when the drought-related slaughtering tapers off, curtailed
supply will drive up the price of meat, he said.
   ``It takes anywhere from 12 to 14 months to raise a calf from
birth to slaughter size so it will be well into nxt year and early
1990 before meat prices can come down again,'' Kottman said.
   The Labor Department offered these details from its producer
price report:
   _At the unprocessed level, wheat was up 25.3 percent; corn, 24.3
percent; turkeys, 22.8 percent; soybeans 22.0 percent; and
chickens, 22.5 percent.
   _At the finished-goods level, prices for eggs rose 16.0 percent;
turkey, 9.3 percent; chicken, 7.3 percent; and fresh fruit, 6.7
percent. Vegetable prices dropped 5.7 percent and rice was down 2.2
percent.
   _Also at the finished level, passenger car prices were up 1.0
percent; women's clothing, up 1.0 percent; home electronic
equipment, down 2.2 percent; and cosmetics, down 0.6 percent.
   The Producer Price Index measures the price of goods at three
levels of production: crude or unprocessed (for example, wheat or
cotton), intermediate (flour or cloth) and finished (wholesale
bread and clothing).

   Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann,
ending three days of uncertainty, said today he will comply with a
Reagan administration demand that he depart the United States.
   Tunnermann made his announcement less than three hours before
the 5:30 p.m. EDT State Department-imposed deadline for him to
leave the country.
   At the same time, Tunnermann said Nicaragua planned to take its
case against the U.S. expulsion order to the legal committee of the
Organization of American States.
   He said that OAS ambassadors should be protected against
``arbitary treatment'' by the United States. Tunnermann serves both
as ambassador to the United States and to the OAS.
   If Tunnermann had chosen to stay, he would have become an
illegal alien, but would have been protected by U.S. law from
summary expulsion and guaranteed a hearing.
   Asked why he did not defy the expulsion order, Tunnermann said,
``We think the U.S. administration could have used this as an
argument against us to continue its aggression against our people.''
   Tunnermann planned to take a 5:15 p.m. flight to Mexico.
However, his wife and seven children planned to remain in the
Washington area.
   She also is attached to Nicaragua's OAS mission and is not
affected by the expulsion order.
   President Reagan had said earlier he expected Tunnermann to
observe comply with the expulsion order by the deadline.
   Asked what the U.S. government would do if Tunnermann defied the
deadline, Reagan told reporters ``we're expecting him to leave at
that hour. Beyond that hour, he is here illegally.''
   ``I don't know where he'll hide,'' the president said,
indicating the government would enforce its expulsion order if
necessary. ``He's illegally here beyond that period of time. We
expect him to be going to the airport or to leave.''
   Reagan made the comments during an Oval Office picture-taking
session with visiting U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar.
   On Tuesday, Reagan gave Tunnermann and seven other Nicaraguan
diplomats 72 hours to leave the country, in retaliation for the
expulsion of U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton and seven colleages
from Nicaragua.
   ``The 72 hours is up at 5:30,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters. ``As the president said yesterday, we
expect him to leave. If he doesn't leave, he is subject to
enforcement of the laws.''
   He did not say which laws he was referring to.
   Tunnermann went before the Organization of American States'
permanent council Thursday to make his case against the U.S.
decision, accusing the Reagan administration of violating
international law by expelling him.
   Most of the OAS delegates remained silent during the 100-minute
meeting, with few willing to take a stand on either side of this
latest chapter in the long-running U.S.-Nicaraguan dispute.
   Tunnermann did not ask the group to take any actions on his
behalf, and no resolutions were introduced.
   Much of the time was spent with Tunnermann and U.S. ambassador
Richard McCormack dueling over responsibility for the continued
strife in Nicaragua.
   Tunnermann, who serves as Nicaragua's ambassador to both the
United States and the OAS, said the administration has no right to
expel diplomats accredited to the OAS.
   ``It is a sovereign decision of our states, that the host
country must respect, to designate its representation before the
permanent council,'' he said.
   McCormack said a 1975 agreement with the OAS gives the United
States the right to expel OAS envoys who behave in an undiplomatic
manner.
   He said Tunnermann and a Nicaraguan military attache, Major
Pedro Sampson, had engaged in ``certain activities'' which violated
their privileges of residence in the United States. The two were
among eight Nicaraguans ordered home by the United States after the
Sandinista government expelled eight American diplomats, including
Ambassador Richard Melton.
   McCormack refused to specify what the two envoys did wrong, nor
has anyone else in the administration.
   Tunnermann insisted that he and his colleagues had
``scrupulously'' observed diplomatic norms during their stay here.
   ``We have been so careful,'' he said, ``that we can't even be
accused of not paying fines for small traffic violations.''
   McCormack said the administration had deferred expelling
Tunnermann and Sampson earlier in order to avoid giving the
Nicaraguan government a pretext for ordering home U.S. diplomats.
   He added that the expulsion of the eight Americans this week
``removed the basis for such restraint on the part of the United
States.''
   Tunnermann got a limited expression of support from Mexican
Ambassador Antonio Icaza, who acted as spokesman for a group of
eight Latin American nations.
   Icaza said OAS governments have a right to appoint their
Washington ambassadors, but this authority is inadequately
protected under the 1975 U.S.-OAS agreement.
   ``As a consequence,'' he said, ``it is necessary to fill this
legal vacuum.''
   The Reagan administration has said it expected Tunnermann and
his colleagues to comply with the expulsion order but the envoy was
noncommittal Thursday when asked by reporters about his plans.
   President Reagan said Tunnermann would have a ``big surprise''
awaiting him if he decided to ignore the U.S. demand, but the
threat was not spelled out.

   Jesse Jackson headed south today looking for
conciliation with Michael Dukakis, as top Democrats questioned
whether President Carter was needed to mediate tensions between the
two camps.
   Jackson, who called on Carter to help ease the rift, insisted
Thursday ``we have every reason to seek a bridge'' spanning
differences between him and the nominee-to-be.
   ``We hope that in the next three or four days that matters will
be resolved'' with Dukakis forces, Jackson said. ``No doubt _ we're
not going to give up on communications.''
   Jackson, in the second day of his three-day bus trek to next
week's convention in Atlanta, has expressed irritation over his
perceived snub during the selection of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen for
the No. 2 spot.
   But he sent conciliatory signals, stressing ways to rebuild
relations with Dukakis.
   First, he said he had spoken with former president Jimmy Carter
about serving as a go-between. Carter has not said publicly whether
he will play any such role. Later, Jackson suggested that top
policy-makers from the two campaigns should talk.
   ``The chief policy advisers of both camps have not met,'' he
said. ``Maybe they could be a bridge in the process. We have every
reason to seek a bridge.''
   In Boston, Dukakis dismissed the idea. ``We don't need
mediators,'' he said.
   Paul Kirk, the party chairman, said today he sees no need for
Carter to be called in to mediate. Instead, he said on ``CBS This
Morning,'' top advisers to Jackson and Dukakis ``ought to come to
the table within the next several hours, talk over the issues, get
the platform discussions back on track and be ready for a real
celebration.''
   Bert Lance, the Jackson adviser and former Carter White House
official, said in an interview, ``I'm not sure it's necessary. ...
Mike and Jesse can deal with whatever they have to deal with.''
   However, Lance also said some involvement by Carter could help
Dukakis with Jackson's followers.
   On the same program, Ron Brown, Jackson's convention manager,
said no one should doubt that Jackson will support the
Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.
   ``The question is what (is) the level and intensity of the
support of his constituents going to be, and that is going to be
dependent upon Michael Dukakis, the message of the party, the
direction of the party,'' Brown said.
   At a news conference on his arrival in Indianapolis, Jackson was
asked if there was reason for optimism that platform and other
differences with Dukakis could be worked out and he said ``I
certainly hope so.
   ``At some appropriate time _ together _ we will meet. No
doubt,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson declined to be specific about what he would seek in
return for his help in turning out black voters, but said his
session with Dukakis should be ``a meeting of substance.''
   He also left open the possiblity that his forces will put his
name into nomination for vice president.
   ``We have not yet made a decision about all the strategies we'll
employ,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson aide Brown said today that ``the campaign has no present
plans to put Jesse Jackson's name up for vice president.''
   The bus caravan, aimed at bringing back memories of the civil
rights era, was also headed for Louisville, Ky., Nashville and
Chattanooga in Tennessee before arriving in Atlanta on Saturday.
   The caravan had been billed as a sort of rolling juggernaut
building steam as it headed South, but Jackson spent most of
Thursday closeted in his bus or meeting with advisers.
   Most of the passengers were reporters rather than Jackson
backers. There were at least 110 in the press entourage while
Jackson supporters numbered between 30 and 35.
   ``We're not picking up passengers, we're registering,'' Jackson
said. ``Because of travel time, we're not encouraging additional
passengers.''
   At a jammed church here Thursday night, Jackson returned to his
fiery speaking style, but focused on efforts to register new voters
for the fall fight against the likely GOP nominee George Bush.
   ``We're getting ready to send Bush back into private life,''
Jackson said. ``We're picking up registrations all the way down the
line.''

   President Reagan on Friday named Howard H.
Baker Jr., former senator and White House chief of staff, to the
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board for a two-year term.
   Baker served as both majority leader and minority leader during
his Senate career and was White House chief of staff for 16 months
before his recent resignation. He will succeed Albert D. Wheelon on
the board.
   Although Reagan leaves office in little more than six months,
some of his appointments to government boards extend into his
successor's administration.
   Reagan also announced the appointment of Tyrus W. Cobb, a member
of the National Security Council staff since 1983, as senior
director of international programs and technology affairs for the
council.
   Cobb has been serving as director of Soviet, West European and
Canadian affairs for the NSC.

   Ten commercial fishermen, plus 21 fish
dealers, markets and restaurants were charged Friday in a sting in
which an undercover game warden was able to buy and sell illegally
caught redfish.
   More than 1,600 of the popular but endangered fish, weighing a
total of more than 8,000 pounds, were illegally bought and sold,
said officials of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.
   ``This may be a greater crime than the theft of money or goods,
because when redfish are gone, they can never be replaced,'' said
Capt. Jim Robertson, supervisor of coastal law enforcement for the
department. ``Every redfish illegally taken from the Texas coastal
waters is something stolen from every Texan, not only today but for
future generations.''
   Commercial fishing for redfish has been illegal in Texas since
1981. Texas was the first state to protect redfish, but now states
from Texas to North Carolina have passed laws to protect the
species from over-harvesting, officials said.
   Last year, the National Marine Fisheries Service prohibited
taking of redfish from federal water, leaving the northern coast of
Mexico from the Texas border to Vera Cruz as the only place redfish
can be taken commercially, said David Cottom of the wildlife
department.
   All the illegally caught redfish, plus some spotted sea trout,
were caught in the Seadrift area on the Texas Gulf coast.
   Robertson said it took about a year for the game warden to
establish himself as a fish dealer. The actual sting operation ran
for about two months, beginning in April.
   ``It's going to be continuing. We're going to start another
one,'' he said.
   ``We certainly hope they're a little more careful and hope they
abide by the regulations,'' Robertson said. ``The message today to
all who illegally sell or buy redfish is that we take that
responsibility (to protect the fish) very seriously.''
   The game warden bought fish from fishermen, then called or
visited buyers. All transactions were conducted without any of the
documentation required to sell redfish imported from other states
or countries, and both sellers and buyers knew it, Robertson said.
   The problem of illegal fishing is widespread, he said.
   ``This involved 10 fishermen in one small area. There's many
small fishing villages like that on the Texas coast. It could be
massive,'' he said.
   The charges filed in the case were various grades of
misdemeanors carrying penalties that include substantial fines and
up to a year in jail. In addition, some violators could be assessed
civil penalties with a charge for each fish bought illegally.
Restitution costs could top $160,000, officials said.

   The Dukakis and Jackson campaigns already had
smoothed out most of their differences on the Democratic platform
before the Jackson side called a halt to the formal negotiations,
Jackson's convention manager said Friday.
   Ron Brown said that when Jackson broke off the negotiations
Wednesday, the platform was ``close to completed. We had dealt with
most of the issues.''
   If the talks resume, Brown said in an interview in Atlanta,
``we'd be close to signing off on it.''
   In Washington, sources on the Platform Committee said the
Dukakis and Jackson campaigns had been seeking a compromise on the
Middle East that would speak of human rights for all under the Camp
David Accords, and make a specific reference to the Palestinians.
   Dukakis platform representatives rejected out of hand last month
in Denver Jackson's call for self-determination for the
Palestinians.
   The sources, who asked not to be identified, said it was likely
that the Dukakis forces would accept a Jackson minority plank on
child care and family issues, while voting down Jackson's call for
higher taxes and a military freeze.
   Jackson has reserved the right to take as many as 13 issues to
the floor for votes Tuesday when the convention takes up the
platform.
   But his negotiators said from the outset it was unlikely they
would pursue them all.
   Brown said that most of the work that remains to be done on the
platform deals with the format and how it will be presented to the
convention.
   Brown said he is in touch with Susan Estrich and Paul Brountas,
Dukakis' campaign manager and chairman, but they were discussing
the larger questions of Jackson's role in the fall campaign, not
the specific platform and convention matters.
   Michael Barnes and Eleanor Holmes Norton, the chief platform
negotiators for the Dukakis and Jackson campaigns respectively,
left Washington Friday for Atlanta.
   Four years ago in San Francisco, the Democrats rebuffed Jackson
by lopsided votes on three minority planks _ a call for a policy of
``no first use'' of nuclear weapons, ``substantial'' cuts in
defense spending, and elimination of runoff primaries _ while
accepting a compromise Jackson proposal on affirmative action. That
convention also adopted Gary Hart's call for limits on use of U.S.
military forces overseas.
   Jackson has nearly 1,150 delegates going to the Atlanta
convention, three times as many as he had in San Francisco.

<HEAD>Heavy Electricity Demand Boosts Industrial Production in June</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. industrial production, boosted by heavy
demand for electricity during the summer heat wave, climbed 0.4
percent in June, the ninth consecutive month without a decline, the
government said Friday.
   The Federal Reserve said the June advance followed identical
gains of 0.5 percent in both April and May and left output 5.8
percent higher than it was a year ago.
   Analysts said the continued improvement showed that American
manufacturers were still benefiting from an export boom, which has
helped push the nation's jobless rate down to a 14-year low of 5.3
percent while giving the country the smallest trade deficits it has
seen in almost three years.
   ``Manufacturing remains the healthiest sector of the economy,''
said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``We continue
to move ahead with an economy driven by the industrial side.''
   But David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., said the
June advance reflected in large part a big 2.6 percent rise in the
output at the nation's utilities.
   Manufacturing showed a much smaller 0.2 percent rise in output.
   ``We are looking for the increases in industrial production to
slow in coming months,'' he said, reflecting an overhang of
inventories at the consumer level that needs to be worked down.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in testimony
earlier this week that the central bank was also looking for
industrial output to slow. He said this would be considered a good
sign that inflationary pressures were easing.
   The 0.2 percent rise in manufacturing reflected a 0.3 percent
increase for factories making durable goods, items expected to last
three or more years, and a smaller 0.1 percent rise in production
of non-durable goods.
   While production of chemical products increased, the non-durable
sector was held back by declines in the output of textiles and
paper.
   Autos were assembled at an annual rate of 7.5 million units in
June, unchanged from May. Production of light trucks, while still
at a high level, edged down slightly last month.
   Production of business equipment showed continued strength, with
a gain of 0.5 percent pushing output in this sector 9.1 percent
above a year ago. The increase last month reflected solid gains in
all major components except construction, mining and farm
equipment, the report said.
   Output in the mining industry, a category that includes oil and
gas drilling, rose 0.6 percent in June, partially reversing a 1.4
percent drop in May.
   The various changes left industrial production at a seasonally
adjusted 136.6 percent of its 1977 base of 100.

   Rolling South aboard his ``Rainbow
Express'' bus caravan, Jesse Jackson spoke again with certain
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis Friday, agreeing to
a meeting of top staffers from the two camps and talking
accommodation instead of discord.
   ``We simply cannot win without each other,'' Jackson said at a
news conference along the route to the Democratic convention in
Atlanta. ``We can only win with each other. It is in our distinct
advantage to find common ground.''
   In addition, Jackson continued to reach out to other top
Democrats, this time talking with New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. He
didn't say what they discussed.
   Jackson said he called Dukakis just prior to a noon rally, and
both agreed that their top policy advisers should meet in Atlanta
Saturday night to discuss differences over Democratic policies.
   ``It does not signal yet the resumption of negotiations,''
Jackson said, but added:
   ``Given the creative tension in the past few days, taking a
diplomative initiative to get more people involved is the right
thing to do,'' Jackson said. ``He (Dukakis) agreed it's the right
thing to do.''
   In preparation for the meeting, Jackson scheduled a gathering of
his aides in Nashville Friday night.
   He said the two have no ``acrimony and hostility'' and have only
policy matters to resolve.
   ``I see the tension we're going through as normal and healthy,''
Jackson said.
   But Jackson made it clear his role should be significant.
   ``People have asked repeatedly what do we expect,'' Jackson
said. ``It is not mysterious. We want a commitment in the platform
and by the nominee to new priorities, and to peace.
   ``We seek partnership and shared responsibility in a plan to win
in the fall,'' Jackson said. ``We seek a seat at the table in a
plan to govern in the spring.''
   Jackson declined to say whether a personal meeting between
himself and Dukakis had been scheduled, repeating only that they
``no doubt will meet at some time.''
   ``We obviously have a common interest in a successful
convention,'' Jackson said.
   But Jackson made it clear that conservative forces have had
their day with the selection of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen to the No.
2 spot, and it's the liberals turn.
   ``All of the talks about conservative Democrats,'' Jackson said.
``They lost in the South on Super Tuesday.''
   Jackson battled Dukakis for the presidential nomination for
months, then lobbied for the vice presidential nomination. He was
then miffed at Dukakis' failure to tell him in advance of Bentsen's
selection.
   The caravan, leaving ripples of attention as it moved South,
included seven buses and an equal number of cars. Inside were about
120 reporters and photographers, 30 or so supporters and about a
dozen delegates, staffers said.
   They arrived in Louisville at mid-day for Jackson to have lunch
at an inner-city church.
   Construction workers stared curiously at the buses festooned
with banners and posters, and knots of people gathered each time
the motorcade swept into a city.
   At rallies along the way, Jackson focused on mobilizing his
supporters, though the convention is sure to nominate Dukakis for
president and Bentsen for vice president.
   Jackson's was the first bus in the caravan, equipped with a
kitchen. He was accompanied by his children and advisers.
   Wife, Jackie, was helping prepare for his arrival.
   ``She was wise enough to fly to Atlanta,'' Jackson said.
   ``We're not picking up passengers; we're registering,'' Jackson
said. ``Because of travel time, we're not encouraging additional
passengers.''
   In the midst of a tense, week-long focus on relations between
the Jackson and Dukakis camps, Jackson took time to lob some fire
at the Republicans and their expected nominee, George Bush.
   ``We survived Reagan, we can survive anything,'' Jackson said.
``We're getting ready to send Bush back into private life.''

   Business inventories climbed in May for the
17th consecutive month, the government said Friday, but sales also
rose strongly, easing economists' worries that too many goods are
accumulating on shelves and back lots.
   The Commerce Department said inventories rose 0.6 percent to a
seasonally adjusted $728.4 billion, while sales rose 0.9 percent to
$483.7 billion.
   The May gain in inventories followed a 0.5 percent climb in
April and was the strongest since a 0.7 percent increase in January.
   The jump in business sales came after a month of no change in
April and a steep increase of 1.9 percent in March.
   Economists generally take a combination of rising inventories
and falling sales as a sign of future production cutbacks. However,
because sales rose srongly in May, the jump in inventories is less
troublesome.
   ``Although there is inventory accumulation occurring now, it is
in line with the fact that sales and production are increasing,''
said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch. ``If sales
were to drop off, then there would be reasons for concern, but
that's not the situation we're in now.''
   Inventories in May were 7.5 percent higher than a year ago,
while sales were 7.8 percent higher.
   The May inventory buildup was boosted by a 0.8 percent climb at
the retail level, where sales were weakest, a 0.7 percent increase
at factories and a 0.3 percent increase at the wholesale level.
   The strength in business sales was paced by a 1.4 percent
increase at manufacturing plants. Wholesale sales climbed 0.6
percent, while retail sales edged up only 0.3 percent.
   Michael K. Evans, an economic forecaster in Washington, said
most of the retail inventory overhang occurred because of weak auto
sales in May.
   ``Excluding cars, retail inventories were up only 0.2 percent.
... June car sales rebounded very strongly which means car
inventories could be coming down,'' he said.
   An advance estimate of retail sales in June, released Thursday,
showed a 0.5 percent rise, bolstered by a strong 1.2 percent rise
in automotive buying.
   The combination of strongly rising sales and moderately rising
inventories held the inventory-to-sales ratio steady at 1.51
percent in May, the same as April. That means it would take 1.51
months to exhaust inventories at the April sales pace, a ratio not
considered abnormally high.

<HEAD>Rape Victim Sues City Over 911</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who was raped in her home after police
responding to a 911 call searched outside, found nothing and left
sued the city Friday, blaming the attack on an inadequate telephone
emergency system.
   The rape Feb. 2 resulted in a shakeup of emergency procedures by
the city and the reprimand of five officers and three 911 employees.
   The suit, filed in state court by the woman and her husband,
seeks unspecified damages.
   The couple charged that the city failed to screen and train 911
employees adequately and failed to correct procedures ``so
deficient that the continued maintenance of them was outrageous and
shocking to the conscience.''
   City Public Safety Director Glenn Cannon and Solicitor Dan
Pellegrini declined comment Friday.
   The woman told police she dialed 911 about 11:15 p.m. after
hearing someone trying to break in to her second-story apartment.
   While she was talking to the 911 operator, a man with a knife
burst in and tore the telephone cord from the wall, authorities
said. The 911 operator thought the woman had hung up, officials
said earlier this year.
   When the intruder saw police walking around the house and heard
them knocking on her door, he threatened the woman and told her he
had ``nothing further to lose and that he might as well rape'' her,
the woman said.
   Police searched outside for several minutes and left. They
didn't break down the door because 911 operators failed to tell
them that the woman reported the break-in herself and that the call
broke off, authorities said.
   No arrests have been made in the attack.
   Cannon ordered 911 operators to pass on detailed information
about emergency calls and to question police about how they resolve
calls before the officers are permitted to leave the scene.

<HEAD>Saudis Turn Oil Wealth Into Military Arsenal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>An AP News Analysis</BYLINE>

<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia is using its oil wealth to
acquire a multibillion-dollar arsenal of arms that is soaring
beyond self-defense needs, worrying Israel and putting Britain in a
position to surpass the United States as the principal supplier to
the Persian Gulf country.
   Even the State Department, usually sympathetic to the Saudis'
pursuit of a modern military force, is showing some concern because
the new air force Britain is providing and missiles from China are
not subject to the kind of constraints Washington would have
insisted on.
   The main rationale for the purchase of jet fighter planes,
helicopters and mine-hunting ships from Britain and
intermediate-range missiles from China is to counter Iran, which
follows a muscular Moslem course at odds with the zealous but
conservative Saudi royal dynasty.
   But ironically, Iraq, which is fighting Iran in an eight-year
war with financial help from the Saudis, may pose a longer-range
threat to the kingdom, in the view of some analysts.
   The Reagan administration has worked hard in Congress to clear
U.S. weapons for the Saudis. The drive succeeded in 1981 when AWACS
radar planes were approved after a bitter fight and failed in 1985
when the purchase of 40 F-15 fighters was shelved under
congressional attack as a potential threat to Israel.
   But when the Saudi missile sale from China surfaced this year,
the State Department grumbled about the Saudis' unwillingness to
permit inspection of the rockets.
   The Chinese and the Saudis offered assurances the missiles would
not be made capable of carrying nuclear warheads, and Riyadh signed
the international treaty against nuclear proliferation, which
provides for inspection.
   When the Saudis struck a $17 billion deal with Britain this
month for about 50 Tornado jet fighters, up to 60 Hawk jet trainer
aircraft, more than 60 Westland Black Hawk helicopters and six
minesweeping vessels, the State Department argued that the weapons
purchase _ one of the largest in history _ was not in the interest
of the United States.
   ``We think our interests are better served when we can sell
legitimate self-defense items to friendly Arab countries, when we
can consult with them, when we can put the regulations, the
restrictions on them that prevent threats to other countries,''
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
   At the same time, the department has consistently rejected any
suggestion that the Saudis might turn their arsenal against Israel.
The oil-rich state contributed money and at least token units in
wars ainst the Jewish state and supported the Palestinian uprising
on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   The U.S. constraints deny the Saudis some of the sophisticated
equipment that could make the weapons a bigger threat against
Israel. Also, the Saudis are sometimes barred from placing their
weapons within easy striking distance of Israel.
   The British apparently imposed no restrictions on the range or
location of the weapons they are selling to the Saudis. The deal is
a follow-up to a $9 billion British sale in 1985 and means Britain
will overtake the United States as the principal Saudi supplier.
   At the same time, London still maintains an arms embargo imposed
against Israel after the invasion of Lebanon in 1982.
   Israeli officials have denounced the deal as regrettable,
cynical and potentially threatening since the Saudis would be under
``tremendous pressure'' to throw the weapons into the mix in the
event of another Middle East war.
   Anthony Cordesman, a Middle East scholar who advises Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., on national security affairs, says the Saudi
buildup implements a strategy devised a few years ago with the
United States to construct an effective air force as a deterrent to
attack from either Iran or Iraq.
   Cordesman said the Saudis are buying billions of dollars of arms
not to threaten Israel, although the lack of constraints on the
British arms poses a potential problem.
   ``I don't think they are on a binge,'' he said. ``I think they
very consistently have pursued the idea the only hope of having an
effective deterrent is to have an effective air force,'' he said.
   From a strategic standpoint, Cordesman saw the United States and
Saudi Arabia in a continuing ``partnership'' despite the purchases
from Britain and China. Only America can project the kind of power
in the Persian Gulf that would protect the Saudis in a major
crisis, while the Saudis would provide bases and other help to the
United States in wartime, he said.
   W. Seth Carus, an adjunct scholar at the Washington Institute
for Near East Policy, traces the buildup to the royal family's ties
with the Saudi defense establishment and riots last year in the
holy city of Mecca.
   ``The Saudis consider themselves the guardians of the holy
places,'' Carus said. ``The Iranians were saying, `You don't have
that right.' For the Saudis that was a declaration of war. The
Saudis found a real enemy.''
   Shai Feldman, senior research associate at Israel's Jaffee
Center for Strategic Studies, said the Saudis face a potential
threat from Iran during the current Persian Gulf war and from Iraq
once the war ends.
   Iraq has built its army up to 28 to 30 divisions in the war with
Iran, and Saudi Arabia and the weaker gulf states ``are going to
worry about the implications,'' he said.
   Adding British Tornados to the air force means the Saudis will
have a jet fighter capable of low-level penetration, one that is
``more offense-oriented than others,'' Feldman said.
   ``That's the real reason some Israelis are worried,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bright Lights, Big Wedding? Michael J. Fox and Former Co-Star to
Marry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael J. Fox, star of NBC's ``Family
Ties,'' is planning to marry actress Tracy Pollan, his former
girlfriend on the show, the actor's agent said Friday.
   Fox's agent, Peter Benedek, said through an assistant only that
the actor was getting married but wouldn't say where or when.
   However, a source close to the actor said Fox would ``be married
by Sunday night.'' Another source said the wedding would take place
in a country inn, probably in Vermont, where Fox owns a 100-acre
homestead.
   Both sources demanded anonymity.
   Ms. Pollan, 27, played the girlfriend of Fox's character, Alex
Keaton, on the popular sitcom before going on to film roles.
   Fox, 26, started dating Ms. Pollan last spring after her
break-up with actor Kevin Bacon, People magazine reported in May.
The couple, who also co-starred in the film ``Bright Lights, Big
City,'' have reportedly purchased a 100-acre homestead in Vermont.
   Fox, at 5-foot-4 and 120 pounds, has a reputation as the
consummate Hollywood nice-guy, helping crew members move sets and
equipment. He is also one of its hottest actors, earning a reported
$17 million last year.
   He rocketed to fame when he starred in ``Back to the Future,''
the top-grossing film of 1985. He was recently in Thailand filming
``Casualties of War'' with Sean Penn.

<HEAD>Husband Can't Sue Wife's Lover over Children</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A husband can't sue his wife's lover for
the emotional distress he suffered when he learned the lover had
fathered her children, a state appeals court ruled.
   Courts should stay out of such affairs, it said Thursday.
   ``The innocent children here may suffer significant harm from
having their family involved in litigation such as this,'' the 1st
District Court of Appeal said in ordering the suit dismissed on
``public policy'' grounds.
   The court said, however, that a husband in such a situation
might be able to sue for reimbursement of money he spent to support
the children after being falsely told he was the father.
   The San Mateo County case involved a divorced couple, identified
by the court as Gerald B. and Linda B., and her lover, Richard P.
   During the affair, the court said, Linda gave birth to a
daughter in 1983 and to a son in 1984.
   She sued for separation from Gerald in 1985, saying at the time
that the children were his. But in a settlement of the divorce case
in January 1987, all parties agreed that Richard was the father.
   Gerald sued Richard the next month, claiming fraud and
intentional infliction of emotional distress, and sought $1.75
million in punitive damages.
   The suit said Richard knew shortly after the births that he was
the father of both children, but misled Gerald into thinking he was
the father, congratulating him and agreeing to be the daughter's
godfather.
   It was only after the children were one and two years old, and
Gerald and his parents had become emotionally attached to them,
that he was told the truth, he said.
   Superior Court Judge Thomas Smith refused to dismiss the suit
but was overruled by the appeals court on a 3-0 vote.
   While fraud and infliction of emotional distress normally are
grounds for a damage suit, the subject of this suit ``is not one in
which it is appropriate for the courts to intervene,'' said the
opinion by Justice Jerome Smith.
   He distinguished the case from suits that have been allowed for
deceit when a woman was infected with venereal disease that her
lover had concealed, or when a woman suffered an abnormal pregnancy
and needed a life-saving operation after her lover told her he was
sterile.
   Both of those cases involved physical injuries and neither had a
potential for harming innocent children, Smith said.
   He also said allowing the suit would conflict with the public
policy of encouraging natural fathers to acknowledge and support
their children.
   ``Men in Richard's situation, who are otherwise willing to
voluntarily acknowledge and support their children, would have a
strong disincentive to do so since revealing the truth would
subject them to this type of tort action,'' Smith said.

<HEAD>Mondale Says Feuding That Goes Too Far Could Be Poison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   ATLANTA ( AP) - Walter Mondale, who lost the presidential race
four years ago after a divided convention, said Friday Democrats
must avoid allowing tensions between Jesse Jackson and Michael
Dukakis from going so far they ``set poison down into the roots''
and spoil chances for the ticket in the fall.
   The former vice president, who is staying out of the spotlight
while Democrats hold their convention in Atlanta beginning Monday,
said he hopes Jackson will join in fully supporting the eventual
Democratic ticket with Dukakis and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen _ and
believes he will despite tensions now.
   ``It is traditional, almost to be expected, that we'll have some
struggles _ but it is how those struggles are conducted and whether
they'll stay within the lines that allow the nominee to come out of
the convention with a feeling in the public that he's ready to
president,'' Mondale said.
   ``I think Rev. Jackson knows that,'' he said.
   ``We always have rising tensions about this time; it's inherent.
... But I believe this is a year where Democrats understand these
fights, if they're carried on too far, become too personalized,
they set poison down into the roots that can be difficult to deal
with.''
   Mondale, in an interview with news agency reporters, also said
he believes Dukakis' failure to reach Jackson by telephone to
inform him of Bentsen's selection as vice president was not an
intentional slight. He said it should not be allowed to become the
basis of crippling divisions.
   ``It wasn't intentional,'' he said, noting that Dukakis tried to
call and was unsuccessful. ``It would have been far better if the
call had been completed in time, but those things happen, with the
best of intentions.''
   The former party standard bearer _ loser in a landslide to
President Reagan in 1984 _ said he was not disappointed that he was
not on the program to address the convention.
   ``No, the point here is to get Dukakis elected, Bentsen elected
_ it's not to revive 1984 or any of those other things,'' he said.
``I would play it exactly the way Mike is playing it. He's got to
be here on his own.''
   Mondale appeared at the start of a daylong conference at the
Jimmy Carter Presidential Center, where Democrats and political
observers held seminars on the 1988 election, and the American
political system, for 300 political and government leaders from
foreign countries.
   Ron Brown, Jackson's convention manager and top adviser, offered
a frank acknowledgement that Jackson would not be the Democratic
nominee while saying he would still have his name placed in
nomination for president.
   ``Although we've all concluded, as I do, that Michael Dukakis
will be the nominee of the party, there will actually be two names
to go to the floor of the Democratic National Convention on
Wednesday night, and those two names are Jesse Jackson and Michael
Dukakis,'' Brown said.
   He described Jackson's campaign as altering the political
landscape forever, making race ``much less a factor in American
politics today.''
   Former President Jimmy Carter spoke to the group at a luncheon
where he praised Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk for having
``orchestrated ... what will be one of the most successful
conventions that we've ever seen, certainly in my political
lifetime.''

<TEXT>
   Republican leaders set up shop Friday to snipe at
the Democrats during their convention next week, and immediately
began talking about the policy differences between Michael Dukakis
and his running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.
   Senate Minority leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said that regardless of
whom Republican George Bush picks as his vice presidential
candidate, ``you're going to find only shades of difference in our
philosophy, not this chasm you find between Dukakis on the one hand
and Lloyd Bentsen on the other.''
   Dukakis and Bentsen have opposing views on subjects ranging from
Contra aid and the Reagan economic program to key defense issues
such as the MX missile, the Strategic Defense Initiative and the B1
bomber. Dukakis has said he doesn't want Bentsen to be a mere clone.
   Dole and Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., held a news conference at a
downtown hotel to announce the opening of a GOP media center,
making Republican leaders available to reporters ``when they need a
quote, an opinion or a different perspective to round out a
story.'' The operation will run each day of the Democratic
convention next Monday through Thursday.
   The planned speakers includes members of Congress, governors,
White House budget chief Jim Miller and others.
   ``We are not here to be negative,'' Dole insisted. ``We are here
to be comparative.''
   Calling the presidential election a crossroads for America, Dole
said, ``We can build on the stable, record-setting economic pace of
the Reagan-Bush years, we can continue to pursue peace through
strength, or we can head down a road already traveled,'' Dole said.
   ``Do we want to go back to 1980? Do we want a reunion with
double-digit inflation, sky-high interest rates, massive
unemployment and America held hostage overseas? I don't think so,''
the senator said.
   ``We Republicans have listened to America and the last thing the
American people want is a radical, wrenching 180-degree change in
direction,'' Dole added.
   The news conference also highlighted differences among
Republicans when the two politicians were asked whether they think
President Reagan should sign a bill _ which the administration
strongly opposes _ requiring advance notice to workers of plant
closings.
   Ms. Martin said she opposes the bill, but Dole said that if he
were president, he might let it become law without his signature
because a veto probably would be overridden. Polls show that a
majority of Americans support the bill, and Democrats plan to make
it a campaign issue if Reagan vetoes it.
   ``In a way, you'd like it to go away cause it's not an easy
issue to explain,'' Rep. Martin commented.
   Dole also took the opportunity to advertise his availability as
a possible running mate with Bush.
   While decrying the differences between Dukakis and Bentsen, Dole
said the Republicans did not have that problem. ``I know. I looked
for sharp differences in my primary contest with George Bush _ you
couldn't find them, whether it was the line-item veto or balanced
budget amendment or a strong defense or SDI _ they weren't there.
   ``You can certainly find them in looking over the comparison
between my good friend Lloyd Bentsen and Gov. Dukakis,'' Dole said.
   While running against Bush, Dole complained repeatedly that the
vice president had not left his mark on foreign policy issues and
other matters.
   Dole also mentioned Ms. Martin as a possible running mate with
Bush. She, in turn, mentioned Dole's wife, Elizabeth, as well as
the senator, as possible candidates.

   Two plaintiffs who lost a race discrimination
lawsuit said Friday a federal judge's refusal to let their attorney
use ``Ms.'' or her maiden name in court generated a furor that
turned their trial into a sideshow.
   ``This was a race discrimination lawsuit. But it got lost in the
shuffle. Somewhere along the line, justice was not served here,''
said Charles Gavin, one of two plaintiffs.
   Gavin, 43, of Donora, and William Sutton, 33, of Washington, who
are black, claimed PPG Industries Inc. fostered and condoned racial
harassment at the company's automotive windshield plant in nearby
Greensburg.
   Following a three-week trial before Senior U.S. District Judge
Hubert Teitelbaum, a jury cleared PPG.
   The verdict came hours after Teitelbaum apologized to Gavin's
attorney, Barbara Wolvovitz, and offered to grant a mistrial
following a flurry of headlines about his threats to jail Ms.
Wolvovitz for not using her husband's name.
   Gavin said the apology and offer for a mistrial, which Ms.
Wolvovitz turned down, was too little too late.
   ``I don't know where to turn now. I want to appeal, and I want
justice ... but I just don't have the money,'' he said. ``It almost
cost me 10 grand to go this far. As far as a mistrial, what am I
going to do about that? The transcript alone will cost $6,000.''
   Gavin said Teitelbaum's behavior ``politicized that jury. He
alienated the jury from us. These people perceived us and our
lawyers as being radical.''
   ``I thought they were on our side until this guy started
performing,'' Sutton said. ``I think the comments he made were
unprofessional, and I think he prejudiced the jury by doing it.''
   The judge interrupted testimony July 8 to scold Ms. Wolvovitz
and threaten that she would ``sleep in the county jail'' if she
refused to be called Mrs. Lobel, her husband's last name, in court.
   The judge found her co-counsel, Jon Pushinsky, in contempt for
coming to her defense. He also polled the female jurors on their
preferences in courtesy titles.
   Ms. Wolvovitz on Monday asked for a mistrial, which the judge
denied, and when she again resisted his order to change her name he
asked: ``What if I call you sweetie?''
   ``He started out with this `sweetie' stuff and then it
escalated,'' Gavin said. ``He even patted her on her head. At one
point he put his hand around her waist. ... ``Even about my wife,
he said, `You have a beautiful wife, don't you agree?'''
   Neither Ms. Wolvovitz nor Pushinski would confirm or deny their
clients' claims.
   ``The record speaks for itself,'' Pushinski said.
   ``It's difficult to remember everything that took place in a
3{-week trial,'' Ms. Wolvovitz said.
   Teitelbaum was not in his office Friday and could not be reached
for comment.
   The judge's law clerk, JoAnn Dempler, said Teitelbaum is often
informal in court, making jokes and small talk to reduce tension.
   But Gavin said the judge's actions on July 8 went beyond that.
   ``The judge was screaming. He was shouting. He pointed at all
these women and screamed at them `What's your name?' When that man
screamed and shouted I said `Oh my God, what's this guy doing? He's
tampering with the jury.'''
   Gavin said Ms. Wolvovitz was so shaken she sobbed while
cross-examining a witness, and that he in turn began to weep.
   ``This man didn't apologize to Sutton and me,'' he said.
``Where's the apology to us? He had me crying.''

   It wasn't the most pleasant experience, but
7-year-old Jessica Lafferty's reward for her pain was an unassisted
triple play.
   Jessica was playing shortstop for the Maroon team in Thursday's
Chester-YMCA T-ball league game against the Royal Blues.
   With runners on first and second, a Royal Blue batter hit a
sharp line drive that struck Jessica in the chest. Jessica doubled
over in pain, but in the process pinned the ball against her body
for the first out.
   Hurt and disoriented, Jessica stumbled toward her coaches, who
were standing at second base. In the process, she recorded the
second out by colliding with the Royal Blue runner who had strayed
off second base.
   Jessica, still cradling the ball and in obvious pain, eventually
reached second, where she found the Royal Blue runner who had been
on first. The player had not tagged up, and Jessica ran into him
for the third out.
   Jessica, flashing an occasional smile between sniffles, was able
to stay in the game.

   John Matar is up to his neck in Styrofoam
peanuts, so he must have had a birthday.
   Not that every July 14th it's peanuts _ sometimes there's an
elephant standing in his front yard. Or a couple of bathing
beauties serenading him. Or a 4,000-pound pet rock perched near his
house.
   The whacky birthday gifts come from John's brother, Sam Matar of
Carmel, Calif.
   The brothers have been trying to outdo each other for 14 years,
so it should have been no surprise that something was up when John
_ who gives his age as 39 _ unlocked the front door Thursday.
   ``This stuff just rolled out on me,'' he said.
   Brother Sam had arranged for 95 huge bags _ a full semiload _ of
the peanut-shaped packing material to be deposited in John's house.
   ``My house is just loaded with it,'' John said. ``It's neck
high, right up to my neck.''
   While this was his nuttiest gift, he said, the one he liked best
was the 2{-carat diamond he got a few years back. Of course, it was
embedded in a huge block of concrete.
   The following February, as Sam's birthday approached, John
arranged to have a truck full of balloons parked in the Las Vegas
casino where Sam was staying.
   ``I sent a note saying you gave me 2{ carats, so I'm going to
top you, here's four,'' John recalled. So Sam dug through the
balloons and found a small black box buried in the semi.
   ``In it was four wilting carrots,'' John said, with a note of
triumph in his voice.

   Now all the excitement and glamour of the
Miss New York State Scholarship pageant can be experienced in your
own home.
   This year's pageant is selling a board game along with other
souvenirs to raise money.
   ``This is the first year the board game has been available,''
said Janet M. Zando, the pageant's vice president for finance. ``I
have been pushing them as a Christmas item. It's kind of early for
that sort of thing, but we want to do all we can.''
   At $18, the board game, which poses trivia questions, is the
most expensive souvenir at the weeklong pageant.
   Pageant representatives also are selling hats and buttons with
the beaming faces of contestants, pens, balloons, autographed
photographs and other baubles.
   Eighteen young women from regions across the state will be
competing Saturday for the title of Miss New York State. The
judging is based 50 percent on talent and 50 percent on a combined
personal interview, evening gown and swimsuit competition.
   Miss New York will receive $3,500 toward college expenses and a
berth in the Miss America contest in September.

<HEAD>Judge Permits Four-Wheel Drive Vehicles On Cape Cod Seashore</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has upheld Cape Cod National
Seashore guidelines allowing off-road vehicles on an eight-mile
stretch of beach, defeating conservationists who claim the vehicles
threaten the fragile ecosystem.
   U.S. District Judge David S. Nelson ruled that off-road vehicle
driving on Cape Cod's northern beaches ``is an appropriate public
use ... and does not adversely affect the Seashore's natural,
scenic and aesthetic values.''
   The Conservation Law Foundation, Massachusetts Audubon Society
and the Sierra Club, which sued over dune buggy use in 1981,
appealed the decision to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The conservationists contend that vehicles threaten shore bird
nesting and the tender vegetation that stems erosion of the dunes.
They also say vehicles destroy the natural beauty and interfere
with other beach-goers.
   But Nelson said in a ruling signed late last month that dune
nesting and beach aesthetics are unaffected by the vehicles, and
that conflicts between drivers and other beach users are minimal.
   Under amended rules issued in 1985, vehicles are limited to the
eight-mile stretch from Hatches Harbor to High Head in Truro.
Winter driving is prohibited and the beach is closed when tides,
beach configurations or bird nesting make the route impassable.
   Just one of the Seashore's six public beaches, Race Point, is
open to drivers, who must get a permit, have their vehicle
inspected and watch a videotape on ecology. The Seashore issues
about 2,000 permits a year, Cape Cod National Seashore chief ranger
Tony Bonanno said Friday.
   All dune areas are off limits except a few tracts with deeded
access rights.
   The ruling ``reinforces the fact that we have taken the
appropriate steps to meet the natural resource objectives and meet
the public interest,'' Cape Cod National Seashore chief ranger Tony
Bonanno said Friday.
   The Cape Cod National Seashore, created by the 1961 federal
Seashore Act, enacted a resource management plan in August 1981 to
control increasing numbers of beach-goers and wheeled vehicles. The
three conservation groups sued the day the plan took effect.
   The original plan allowed vehicles on 12 miles of beach from
April to November, and on a 25-mile stretch in Eastham in winter.
After an order from Nelson, the plan was amended in 1985.
   ``The court is basically saying, yes, the '85 plan is a
resonable plan, it addresses adequately the balance of different
uses, accommodates all visitors to the Seashore and protects its
resources,'' Bonanno said.
   Conservationists say off-road vehicle use is prohibited under
the Seashore Act, which bans action that ``would be incompatible
with the preservation of the unique flora and fauna or the
physiographic conditions now prevailing.''
   But the act permits recreational development _ for activities
such as fishing, camping and sailing _ that is environmentally
``compatible'' and ``appropriate'' to the beach. The government can
ban off-road vehicle use if found to have adverse effects on soil,
vegetation or wildlife habitats.
   The law foundation said policing drivers is difficult, that even
small incursions on tender dune grass are harmful and that the
Seashore has handed over one-fifth of the beach to drivers, who
comprise just 3 percent of its 6 million annual users.
   ``The law did not envision the rampant off-road vehicle use that
has gone on since the Seashore was created,'' foundation staff
scientist Paul Hauge said Friday.
   Bonanno said rangers last year filed 236 reports of dune buggy
violations, issuing about 100 fines of $50 and 100 warnings.
   Seashore officials said most beach drivers are fishermen needing
access to the tip of Race Point.
   A National Park Service survey found that only a small
percentage of Seashore visitors opposed vehicle use or said they
were displaced by it.

   Fifteen residents of the Bethel
Children's Home were placed in state custody when a judge found
they had been subjected to abuse from a director who has said he
relies on paddlings and exercise to reform.
   A 16th child was released to parents.
   Youth Court Judge Robert Oswald ruled Thursday 11 of the
children had been abused, three abused and neglected and one
neglected.
   Oswald's rulings were the latest action in a feud between the
state and the home's founder, the Rev. Herman Fountain.
   Fountain claims the First Amendment and its separation of church
and state shield Bethel from state intervention. State Welfare
Commissioner Thomas Brittain wants to use the case to persuade the
Legislature to require the registration or licensing of religious
boarding homes.
   Mississippi is one of five states that has no such law.
   The 16 children were among 72 Oswald ordered removed from the
home in June. That followed his decision that a 14-year-old runaway
had been abused and neglected.
   An unknown number of residents fled when officials arrived at
the home June 10. Fountain has told the media he had about 120
children at the home, most from out of state. But he has refused to
comply with a court order to provide a list of their names. About
50 children haven't been accounted for.
   Fountain, who has said he uses licks with a switch or exercise
to control and reform children, and two of his assistants are being
fined $500 each per day for refusing to answer questions in court.
   Two days of hearings were held this week concerning discipline
and care of the 16 children. Most of the other children already
have been released to their parents or guardians.
   State officials contend some of the practices at the 10-year-old
institution constitute abuse and that children have been medically
neglected while at Bethel.
   Youth Court hearings are normally closed to the news media, but
Oswald opened the hearings on the condition the children not be
identified.

<HEAD>Teamsters Reject Presser's Heir, Name McCarthy President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Teamsters turned Friday to one of its
``old guard'' leaders, William J. McCarthy, to head the besieged
union, narrowly rejecting the image-conscious heir designate of the
late Jackie Presser.
   The union's 17-member General Executive Board elected McCarthy,
69, of Boston, by a one-vote margin over Secretary-Treasurer Weldon
Mathis to fill out the last three years of Presser's term as the
Teamsters' president.
   Presser, who died a week ago, had appointed Mathis, 62, of
Atlanta, in May as acting president of the 1.6-million-member
union. The appointment was to last for 120 days, and was made just
before Presser underwent brain surgery for cancer.
   Mathis remains the union's secretary-treasurer in the wake of
the board's decision Friday.
   The turnover in the top post of the nation's largest union _ one
in every 75 working Americans is a Teamster _ occurs just two weeks
after the Justice Department filed suit to seize control of its
affairs, claiming the union's leadership has been controlled by
organized crime for more than 30 years.
   McCarthy led a a rump movement among Teamster vice presidents
against a new nationwide trucking contract, signed in May, covering
some 200,000 union members. McCarthy indicated Friday he now will
try to reopen the pact.
   ``I don't know what I can do but I plan to do everything I can
to improve on it and get the wishes of our membership,'' he said at
a news conference following his election.
   The contract was declared ratified, even though 64 percent of
the affected members who voted opposed it. Rejection requires a
two-thirds vote under the union's constitution.
   McCarthy, who has presided over the 8,000-member Teamsters Local
25 in Charlestown, Mass., for 33 years and headed the international
union's operations in New England for two decades, declined to
discuss his power struggle with Mathis.
   ``That's not the issue,'' he said. ``I got enough votes to
become the president. The great strength of this board is that we
will argue and fight about an issue but when the majority vote is
taken, everyone stands behind the decision.''
   Asked by a reporter what Presser would have thought about his
election, McCarthy confirmed his reputation for a quick temper.
``Who knows? Maybe he would roll over in his grave,'' McCarthy
replied. ``I don't know what he was thinking. Why don't you try to
locate him. That's a goofy question, I'll give you a goofy answer.''
   The board's exact vote was not announced, but several sources,
all speaking on condition of anonymity, said McCarthy won by a 9-8
count.
   Supporters of Mathis tried several maneuvers to thwart
McCarthy's ascension, including postponing the decision until a
special convention of 2,000 Teamster representatives could be
assembled. But their various proposals were all rejected by the
same 1-vote margin.
   At least two union vice presidents _ the board consists of 16
vice presidents and Mathis _ objected to declaring the vote for
McCarthy unanimous, a Teamster tradition when the mantle is passed
from one president to another, one source said.
   ``Two years from now, you're going to start seeing people
campaigning like crazy,'' he said, referring to the union's next
international convention in the spring of 1991.
   Both McCarthy and Mathis are viewed by leaders of other labor
unions as being ``clean'' _ with no major ties to organized crime
figures in contrast to the ties that the government alleges that
Presser and former Teamster Presidents Roy Williams and Jimmy Hoffa
had. Mathis was seen, in addition, as more image-oriented. Mathis
helped Presser orchestrate several public relations campaigns in
recent years, and helped open the union to women and other groups
in an attempt to expand the membership base in the wake of problems
generated by trucking deregulation.
   Like all of the Teamster vice presidents, McCarthy was named a
defendant in the federal suit to take over the union. But his name
surfaced only once in the 200 pages of documents the government
filed two weeks ago to support its case.
   In a transcript of an FBI-wiretapped conversation on May 9,
1984, convicted New York crime boss Anthony Salerno is quoted as
recognizing McCarthy's name as the Teamsters' ``head boss of the
East Coast, this guy.''
   With the government's unprecedented attempt to take over the
union, McCarthy said Friday he has a ``tough job ahead. ``It should
be condolences, not congratulations.''
   But he said he is confident the Teamsters will eventually win
the case when it goes to trial before U.S. District Court Judge
David Edelstein in New York.
   ``There's a lot of insinuations and allegations made,'' he said.
``But ... if the judge hears our side, I feel we will come out just
as clear as we were and have been.''

<TEXT>
   A conference on the Holocaust on Friday accused
Christian churches of centuries of anti-Jewish teaching, and one
U.S. expert said the tradition helps explain why Nazi genocide went
unchecked in Christian Germany.
   ``The failure of European civilization to stem the tide of evil
during the Holocaust makes it critically important to counteract
historical and traditional Christian anti-Jewish teaching,'' said a
statement issued by the international conference.
   The statement concluded a weeklong gathering of 500 academics,
concentration camp survivors, theologians and teachers. The
conference met in the university town of Oxford before moving to
London on Friday.
   Christian churchmen, including Britain's Roman Catholic Cardinal
Basil Hume, joined in prayers for the Nazis' 6 million Jewish
victims, and conference organizers read out messages from leaders
of the United States, France, Britain, Israel and the European
Economic Community.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl received a standing ovation
for a message in which he acknowledged German responsibility for
the Holocaust and said: ``We Germans are prepared to live with this
terrible truth.''
   President Ronald Reagan said, ``The words `never again' must
ever be the pledge of all who pause in remembrance of those who
have perished.''
   A major theme of the conference was how Christians allowed the
World War II slaughter of Jews to happen.
   Delegates focused on longtime Christian church teachings that
the Jews were responsible for the murder of Jesus Christ and were
condemned to wander without a homeland. Most churches have since
stopped espousing this belief, including the Catholic Church in
1965.
   The Rev. Franklin Littel, an American Methodist minister and a
leading academic expert on the Holocaust, said that despite ``an
acute rise in sensitivity (by Christian churches toward Jews) in
the past 25 years ... the problem remains.''
   ``Why do you suppose the liberal Protestant churches find it so
hard to come to terms with Israel?'' asked Littel, a former
professor of religion at Temple University in Philadelphia and at
the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
   ``It is because they are used to teaching that the Jew is a
loser,'' Littel said in an interview. ``They've been teaching for
centuries that he is supposed to wander, supposed to be miserable.''
   Littel said that in 1936, Germany's Catholic bishops
courageously protested the persecution of Jews.
   But he said the Nazi response was ``what are you complaining
about _ we're just doing what your churches have been teaching
about all along.''
   The Anglican bishop of Oxford, the Rt. Rev. Richard Harris, said
Christians had to examine ``how it is that at the heart of a
so-called Christian civilization, such unspeakable atrocities could
be perpetrated.''
   Harris heads an Anglican committee which will submit a new
policy document on the church's relations with Jews to the Lambeth
Conference, an international gathering of Anglican bishops opening
Monday.
   Several participants at the conference paid tribute to
Christians who helped Jews during the Holocaust.
   Historian Yehuda Bauer noted that 24 British doctors, only one
of whom was a Jew, went to treat those being liberated from
Auschwitz concentration camp. Many of the prisoners were known to
have typhoid and none of the doctors who volunteered had received
immunizations. As a result, many of them died.
   The conference was sponsored by publisher Robert Maxwell, 65, a
Czechoslovak-born Jew who fled to Britain as a teen-ager, and his
French Protestant wife, Elisabeth.
   Maxwell asked delegates to stand and applaud after reading out
Kohl's message.
   ``Germans became guilty of that crime (the Holocaust) as
individuals, but they are collectively liable for the injustice
committed in their name,'' Kohl, a Catholic, said in his message.
   ``No one can rule out the possiblity of comparable atrodcities
happening again,'' Kohl's message added. ``It must not be
forgotten.''

<HEAD>State Department Pressed To Lift Suspension of Soviet Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-three senators and nine House members
on Friday called for an immediate end to the State Department's
suspension of refugee processing, which has left thousands of
prospective immigrants to the United States temporarily stranded in
the Soviet Union.
   The senators told President Reagan in a letter: ``This decision
sends a terrible signal to those seeking freedom all over the
world, and could give the Soviets the opportunity to claim that it
is America and not the Soviet Union which is impeding emigration.''
   The House members, all members of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on refugees, asked Secretary of State George P. Shultz
either to find the estimated $10 million required to resume refugee
processing at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow or to ask Congress for
additional funds.
   The suspension went into effect on July 4 and is scheduled to
last until Oct.1.
   It came after a sudden surge in the number of visa applications
by Soviet citizens, mostly Armenians and Jews, and after the Reagan
administration had increased the annual number of refugees the
United States would accomodate.
   The Soviet Union relaxed emigration policies recently and in
June the U.S. embassy issued some 2,000 refugee visas, more than
the total approved for all of the 1987 fiscal year which began Oct.
1, 1986.
   ``In light of the promises this country has made to welcome and
resettle thousands of emigres from the Soviet Union, the suspension
should be lifted immediately,'' the House members told Shultz in a
letter.
   They said the suspension will result in the ``forced
displacement of many families who have already lost their homes and
their jobs, and who, in many cases, have made long journeys to
Moscow to begin refugee processing.''
   ``After urging the Soviets to open the gate of emigration, it is
important that we find this funding for refugee assistance, the
letter said. ``To do otherwise could leave thousands of people in a
state of uncertainty and desperation, and send a disturbing signal
that the United States is unwilling to back up its commitment to
accomodate those seeking refuge.''
   Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., who initiated the House letter,
said his attention was drawn to the situation when a couple with
four children he been attempting to help leave the Soviet Union
were told the Moscow embassy could not process their applications
for three months.
   Schumer said two members of the family of Zoltan and Pepa
Forkosh are sick and two are infants.
   He said they had traveled to Moscow from the Ukraine, have been
compelled to move into an expensive apartment and are rapidly using
up their funds.
   Other signers of the House letter were Reps. Patrick L.
Swindall, R-Ga.; Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn.; Howard L. Berman,
D-N.Y.; D. French Slaughter, R-Va.; Hamilton Fish Jr., R-N.Y.;
Barney Frank, D-Mass.; Bill McCollom, R-Fla.; and John Bryant,
D-Texas.
   Senators signing the letter to Reagan were Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J.; John Stennis, D-Miss.; Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis.; Daniel
K. Inouye, D-Hawaii; Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.; Quentin Burdick, D-N.D.; James J. Exon, D-Neb.; Paul
Simon, D-Ill.; Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; Bob
Graham, D-Fla.; Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.; Harry Reid,
D-Nev.; Carl Levin, D-Mich.; Lowell Weicker, R-Conn.; Jay
Rockefeller, D-W.Va.; John Heinz, R-Pa.; George J. Mitchell,

<HEAD>Baltimore Scientists Find Key Protein In Detecting Aromas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A complex protein produced in a nasal gland
has been identified by researchers as the chemical messenger that
carries aromas to the odor-sensing nerves of the nose.
   Dr. Solomon Snyder of Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine in Baltimore said Friday he and three other researchers
have cloned the gene that gives instructions for the creation of
the protein and may one day be able to use the protein to sharpen
the sense of smell.
   The protein, called the odorant binding protein or OBP, is
secreted by the lateral nasal gland and then carried by a duct to
the tip of the nose, Snyder said. When air is inhaled, the OBP is
sprayed as fine mist into the air that flows into the nose, he said.
   Snyder said the protein binds with airborne molecules as they
are inhaled and is then carried past a nerve bundle that picks up
the chemical message of the odor.
   ``The nerve endings are way back, high in the nose,'' Snyder
said in a telephone interview. ``Only a small portion of the nose
has these receptors.''
   When the OBP comes in contact with the receptors, the nerves
interpret the chemistry of the OBP as a particular smell.
   Snyder said the precise mechanism of how the nerves can
distinguish between different smells, such as sweet and sour, is
not yet understood. He said what is detected as a fragrance may
actually be caused by the chemical reaction of the OBP mixed with
the fragrance molecule.
   By cloning the gene that produces the OBP, Snyder said his team
should be able to produce large quantities of the protein and
conduct further studies into the sense of smell, one of the least
understood of the senses.
   Use of OBP may be of medical significance in restoring lost
appetite or helping patients who have totally lost the sense of
smell.
   ``This could help the elderly regain their appetite,'' said
Snyder. ``As people age, they lose their sense of smell'' and this
often is the reason that older people stop eating as they should.
   By spraying OBP into the nose, he said, it may help restore some
of the sense of smell.
   Snyder said much more research must be conducted before
specific, clinical uses for the OBP are found.
   A report on the study was published Friday in Science, the
journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Others on the OBP research team are Jonathan Pevsner, also of
Johns Hopkins, and Randall R. Reed and Paul G. Feinstein of the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

   The lingering drought has forced organizers of
Lodi's seventh annual Sweet Corn Festival to import corn for the
event all the way from down South.
   ``You can't find anything home-grown right now; it is coming out
of Alabama and Georgia,'' said Jerry Miller, produce manager at a
store in Medina, who obtained the corn through a Cleveland food
terminal.
   In wetter years, festival organizers have had to go no farther
than Bill Richardson's Medina County farm to get sweet corn.
   But Richardson has no edible sweet corn to offer this year.
   Richardson provided sweet corn to past festivals for free but
this year, festival organizers paid $9 each for 50 cases of 45 ears.
   Miller said that in a normal year, he could have obtained corn
from an Ohio farmer for about half that price.
   Festival visitors, however, will still pay the 75 cents an ear
charged last summer.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clarence Dickson, the first black to head Miami's
police force, announced his retirement Friday, saying the
corruption problems that rocked the department during his 3{-year
tenure are ``behind us now.''
   Dickson, 54, will be replaced by another black, Assistant Chief
Perry C. Anderson.
   A Miami policeman for almost 29 years, Dickson became eligible
for retirement this year and said at a news conference that he
simply decided to take it.
   ``This was entirely my own idea,'' he said. ``I felt like the
highlights of my career I had already experienced.''
   Dickson said he was proud of overcoming challenges ``such as the
corruption problems in the department. That is behind us now.''
   The soft-spoken chief inherited a department that had doubled to
almost 1,100 officers _ many poorly trained _ after the 1980
Liberty City riots and the Mariel boatlift.
   Under his tenure, about 100 officers were charged with crimes or
punished administratively, including those convicted in the ``River
Cops'' case that grew out of a deadly cocaine ripoff ring run by
officers on the midnight shift.
   But in addition to the successful actions against rogue cops,
there were lingering embarrassments, including the unsolved theft
of $150,000 from the narcotics unit.
   At the news conference, Dickson took pains to say that no one
had forced him out. But afterward, he blasted the Miami City
Commission, saying a three-member majority did not like him, ``and
frankly I didn't like them very much.''
   The city manager's quick choice of Perry to replace Dickson, who
was a symbol to many in Miami's black community, was seen as an
effort to decrease tension the chief's departure might create.

   A special task force headed by Agriculture
Secretary Richard E. Lyng told President Reagan on Friday the 1988
drought and abnormal heat are the worst on record at this stage of
the season, and have bitten deeply into harvests of wheat,
soybeans, corn and other livestock feed grains.
   ``While July rains have eased the dry conditions in some parts
of the Great Plains and Delta, conditions have worsened in the
eastern Corn Belt and Southeast where crops are now in the critical
growth stage,'' the panel said in its second report to the
president.
   Market prices for a number of commodities ``are well above
spring levels and are highly volatile,'' the report said. Some
livestock producers, faced with rising feed costs, have been forced
to liquidate herds.
   The report mostly reviewed what has been said before by the
Agriculture Department and other agencies, and during President
Reagan's tour this week in drought areas of Illinois and Iowa.
   Lyng will head a team on a three-day visit next week to 11
drought-stricken states, from Tennesee to the Dakotas.
   As USDA had reported earlier, the report noted that 1988 wheat
production is down 13 percent from last year, and that the corn
crop is expected to decline by 26 percent to 5.2 billion bushels.
Soybean output is also projected to drop by 13 percent.
   Consumer food prices, the task force reported, are expected to
rise an additional 1 percent this year because of the drought, and
another 2 percent in 1989. That was in line with previous USDA
estimates.
   The task force said drought relief legislation has been working
its way through Congress and ``would provide effective disaster
assistance if it advances unencumbered with provisions unrelated to
the drought'' and meets budgetary and other guidelines.

<HEAD>Once-Disgraced Soviet Satirist Is Rehabilitated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixteen years after he was expelled from the
Soviet Writers Union for allegedly urging Jews to emigrate, Russian
songwriter Alexander Galich has been posthumously reinstated, it
was reported Friday.
   The action by the writers union amounts to a rehabilitation of
the popular Jewish bard once condemned by the official press as a
``traitor'' and a drunkard with a ``pathological lust for money.''
   The announcement by the official Tass news agency called Galich
``a talented poet, songster and playwright'' who was unjustly
vilified.
   ``Bureaucrats responsible for culture in the 1970s closed the
doors to the press and the motion pictures industry before him and
then hounded him out of the country for what they considered
`seditious' writings,'' Tass said.
   Galich's satire about official hypocrisy, the apathy of the
Soviet masses and the labor camps that dot the nation made him
unpopular with authorities. But he was a hit among the people, who
listened to his songs on tapes circulated underground and read them
in books published abroad.
   The writers union, accusing Galich of ``agitation for the
emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel,'' expelled him from its ranks
in January 1972. Galich, who wrote screenplays in addition to
songs, was also expelled from the Soviet Cinema Workers Union.
   He left the Soviet Union in 1974 and died in Paris three years
later.
   Tass did not say when the writers union readmitted Galich. It
also did not say whether he was readmitted to the film workers
union.
   Since coming to power in March 1985, Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has encouraged the rehabilitation of cultural figures
once disgraced in official eyes.
   Tass noted that in recent months, several literary journals have
published poems by Galich and a play he wrote 30 years ago,
subsequently banned, has just premiered in Moscow.

<HEAD>Carter Says Communication Key for Dukakis, Jackson</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>

   Former President Carter, declaring his services
as a mediator unneeded, said Friday that the relatively minor
differences between Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson could vanish
``if the two men understood each other a little bit better.''
   ``The compatability between Jackson and Dukakis and their
followers are so overwhelming that the differences are relatively
insignicant,'' Carter said in an interview with The Associated
Press at the Carter Presidential Center.
   ``I don't think they need any mediation,'' he said. ``I think
what is needed is to just have a better means of communication
directly with one another and to get any misunderstandings resolved
as early as possible in the convention.''
   Jackson, who sought to be named Dukakis' vice presidential
candidate, seemed miffed when the pick went to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen
of Texas and word got out before Dukakis personally relayed the
decison to Jackson. He said Thursday that he had asked Carter to
act as mediator between his and Dukakis' camps.
   However, Dukakis rejected that idea Friday, and Jackson aides
also expressed doubts about it.
   Carter said if any mediation is needed the role should go to
Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk but that he might
get involved if Kirk asked him to. However, Kirk also said he saw
no role for a mediator.
   The former president said he did not see ill will over the vice
presidential choice lasting much past the convention. ``That's one
of the reasons for the convention, to resolve differences within
the party. It is not unprecedented,'' Carter said.
   ``When the Rev. Jackson called me ... we talked about the
procedures that I always used when I was running for president or
when I was in the White House.
   ``When I had a major decision to make ... I brought into the
White House key leaders of the black community, who were also my
political supporters. I asked them for advice and I listened very
carefully to them. There was never any doubt that in a very genuine
way they were a part of the deliberations of my government.''
   Carter said he thought the choice of Bentsen could help Dukakis
in the South against the expected Republican presidential
candidate, Vice President George Bush.
   He described Bentsen as ``a man who provides a philosophical
balance to the ticket'' and ``who has had a lot to do with minority
problems with Spanish and blacks in Texas, and I think he's
well-respected in the South.''
   Carter said he plans no major role for himself at the convention
or during the campaign. He is to address the convention Monday
night.
   If during the campaign incorrect statements are made about
events to which he was a party, or has special knowledge, Carter
said, ``I will reserve the right to set the record straight.''

<HEAD>Mayor's Panel Recommends Razing Public Housing High-Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city should demolish most, if not all, of its
168 public housing high-rise buildings for families and find new
homes for the 70,000 tenants, a report by a mayor's advisory group
recommends.
   Contents of the report, completed in May and submitted to Mayor
Eugene Sawyer more than a month ago have not been made public
officially, but they were outlined in Friday's editions of the
Chicago Tribune.
   ``The report doesn't recommend tearing down any housing until
adequate housing is available,'' Philip Klutznick, co-chairman of
the 25-member panel, said by telephone Friday. He declined to
discuss the report further.
   A spokeswoman for the mayor said Friday that Sawyer planned to
release details of the report by the Mayor's Advisory Council on
the Chicago Housing Authority later this month.
   The council's recommendation to raze family high-rises
represents the strongest and most official endorsement of a
politically sensitive concept that has been discussed for many
years, the newspaper said.
   The panel's call for gradual elimination of the family
high-rises is based, the newspaper said, on problems common in
public housing in Chicago and other cities _ a rapidly
deteriorating housing stock, a lack of funding to make necessary
repairs and the worsening of social problems that occur by crowding
large numbers of poor families together.
   Edward Marciniak, a Loyola University urban studies professor
who published a 1986 book advocating replacement of high-rises,
said public housing residents should be relocated throughout the
metropolitan area.
   ``People have blinders when they think we can solve the
challenge of providing safe, sanitary, decent housing in the city
itself,'' said Marciniak, who was not a member of the advisory
panel, which was established more than a year ago by the late Mayor
Harold Washington.
   According to the council's report: ``High-rise buildings per se
are not a problem. Rather, the problem ... is the intense
concentration of large, poor, primarily single-parent families in
buildings poorly designed to support their needs.''
   ``This is further compounded by the concentration of such
buildings in close proximity to each other while being racially and
economically segregated and isolated from viable neighborhoods,''
the report said.
   Worsening conditions at the city's public housing developments
are mainly due to a 76 percent drop in federal funding for housing
programs nationally over the last eight years, the council said.
   It said the cost of replacing 800 CHA units a year would be $20
million to $48 million, but contended this would be cheaper than
trying to rehabilitate many of the high-rises.
   Funds raised through the sale of CHA properties could be used to
buy buildings or construct them, the report said. In addition, it
suggested that another source of money would be federal funds now
earmarked for rebuilding the high-rises.

<HEAD>GOP Makeover Of Superdome 20 Percent Complete, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN McGILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican National Convention officials said
Friday their $15 million makeover of the Louisiana Superdome is
already about 20 percent complete just five days after they took
over the massive arena to prepare for next month's convention.
   ``We are on schedule or ahead of schedule on every phase,''
convention manager Bill Phillips told reporters during a guided
tour of the dome.
   Work was being done on the framework of a huge, $570,000 podium
from which President Reagan, Vice President Bush and other
dignitaries will adress the 31,000 people expected to attend the
convention, which runs Aug. 15-18.
   Phillips said the Republican Party is spending about $9 million
on the convention. The city of New Orleans is raising about $5.5
million through private contributions to pay for the sound and
light systems and other projects.
   ``Basically, we're looking at a $15 million operation,''
Phillips said.
   Best known as an indoor football stadium, the dome is looking
less and less like the home of the New Orleans Saints and more and
more like a media center.
   Four television networks will have tall, multi-level booths near
the podium. Carpenters and electricians worked to convert suites
known as skyboxes, which overlook the floor from the perimeter of
the stadium, into broadcast booths for other radio and television
broadcasters.
   Arising on either side of the podium was the framework for the
structures from which print journalists will observe the
proceedings.
   Still to come is the hanging of the nine-story high, three-ton
blue curtain that will serve as a room divider for the dome. Public
convention business will be conducted for the cameras on one side
while trailers, used as offices, will be driven onto the floor
behind the curtains.
   Phillips said construction should be completed by Aug. 10,
giving convention officials plenty of time to run tests on
equipment before the convention begins.
   Once the convention ends, the construction work begins again _
in reverse. The Republicans' agreement with the Superdome calls for
the stadium to be restored to its original condition by Aug. 25.

<HEAD>TRADE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit rose in May to $10.9 billion, but the
imbalance was the second smallest in almost three years, the
Commerce Department reported. The gap between imports and exports
widened by $627 million from a revised April imbalance of $10.3
billion.
   U.S. exports climbed 2.3 percent in May to $26.6 billion, while
imports rose 3.4 percent to $37.6 billion.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WHOLESALE PRICES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices edged up a moderate 0.4 percent in June, but
drought sent prices for raw food soaring at their steepest pace in
more than 2{ years.
   The Labor Department said raw costs jumped 4.2 percent last
month, a rate not seen since the 5.1 percent climb of October 1985.
Prices for foods ready to be retailed rose 1.1 percent, reflecting
earlier, though less severe, increases in raw food costs.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSINESS INVENTORIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories in May rose a moderate 0.6 percent, held in
check by a 0.9 percent jump in sales, the Commerce Department said.
   Inventories rose $4.4 billion to a seasonally adjusted $728.4
billion while sales rose $4.2 billion to $483.7 billion.
   The May gain followed a 0.5 percent climb in April and a 0.4
percent increase in March. The jump in business sales came after a
month of no change in April and a steep increase of 1.9 percent in
March.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   U.S. industrial production, boosted by heavy demand for
electricity during the summer heat wave, climbed 0.4 percent in
June, the ninth consecutive month without a decline. The Federal
Reserve said the June advance followed identical gains of 0.5
percent in both April and May and left output 5.8 percent higher
than it was a year ago.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>U.S. STOCK MARKET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices posted a moderate gain in an erratic session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 15.83 to 2,129.45,
finishing the week with a net gain of 23.30.

   The dollar zoomed to recent highs against several major
currencies.
   In Tokyo, the dollar finished at 133.40 yen, up 0.45 yen from
Thursday's close. Later in London, it was quoted at 135.35 yen. In
New York the dollar closed at 135.45 yen, up from 133.18 yen on
Thursday.
   In London, the dollar gained more than 2.5 cents against the
British pound to reach its highest level since October. It cost
$1.6635 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6890 late Thursday. In
New York, the pound cost $1.6605, far cheaper than Thursday's
$1.6875.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says No Mediator; Jackson Conciliatory; Bush Going Fishing</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates in top 13 grafs with Dukakis, Carter comments, two
sides close on platform; editing throughout to shorten</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>

   Michael Dukakis said Friday he doesn't need a mediator to settle
his pre-convention differences with Jesse Jackson, and his
Democratic rival acknowleged, ``We can only win with each other.''
   The two men talked by telephone and agreed to have their top
aides meet in Atlanta Saturday night, as they edged away from a
confrontation that threatened to disturb the peace at the party's
convention.
   ``I want him involved, I want his staff people involved,'' said
Dukakis, whose nomination is assured. At the same time, he curtly
rejected his rival's call to have former President Carter mediate
their disagreements. ``We don't need mediators,'' he said in an
interview in the Massachusetts Statehouse.
   Carter, in an interview in Atlanta, also said his services as a
mediator were unneeded. He called for better communication and
suggested relatively minor differences between Dukakis and Jackson
could vanish ``if the two men understood each other a little bit
better.''
   The latest Democratic developments came as Vice President George
Bush was ready to hang a ``gone fishing'' sign on his door in
Washington. Aides said he would spend the next several days in
Wyoming with Treasury Secretary James Baker, who is expected to
resign his Cabinet post shortly to join his old friend's campaign
for the White House.
   Bush's Republican surrogates set up camp behind enemy lines in
Atlanta and began stressing the policy differences between Dukakis
and his more conservative running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said that regardless of
whom Bush picks as his vice presidential candidate, ``you're going
to find only shades of difference in our philosphy, not this chasm
you find between Dukakis on the one hand and Lloyd Bentsen on the
other.''
   In his Statehouse interview, Dukakis insisted that Democrats are
unified despite Jackson's prodding on platform issues and Jackson
supporters' complaints about the selection of Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen as running mate.
   ``I can't remember a time when we've (the Democrats) been more
together,'' he said.
   He said he thought the party reflected ``a broad national
consensus'' on such issues as trade, plant closing, health care and
the environment.
   ``I think that's the reason you just don't have these deep
ideological divisions that you often have had in the past.''
   Jackson's convention manager, Ron Brown, said the two sides had
already smoothed out most of their differences on the Democratic
platform before Jackson called a halt to the formal negotiations.
   If the talks resume, Brown said in an interview in Atlanta,
``we'd be close to signing off on it.''
   Jackson called a news conference in Louisville, Ky., as his bus
caravan wound southward toward the convention city.
   ``We simply cannot win without each other. We can only win with
each other,'' he said of himself and Dukakis.
   ``It is in our distinct advantage to find common ground.''
   ``Given the creative tension in the past few days, taking a
diplomatic initiative to get more people involved is the right
thing to do,'' Jackson said of the meetings of top aides set for
the weekend.
   He refused to say whether he would challenge Bentsen's vice
presidential nomination, and Dukakis said he didn't know what would
happen on that score.
   For his part, Dukakis refused to disclose the nature of his
conversation with Jackson. But he ruled out his rival's idea to
have former President Carter play mediator in their pre-convention
disagreements.
   Carter also said he didn't think his services were needed.
   ``I don't think they need any mediation. I think what is needed
is to just have a better means of communication between one
another,'' he added in an interview.
   Even before they made their comments, the idea seemed to be
going nowhere.
   ``I don't think, in my view, that the fact that there has been
some miscommunication at this point requires the president of the
United States to come to the table,'' Party chairman Paul Kirk told
CBS in an interview.
   A top Jackson aide also cast doubt on the idea, and Bert Lance,
a confidant of both the former president and Jackson, did as well.
``Mike and Jesse can deal with whatever they have to deal with,''
he said.
   The Democratic convention city was beginning to fill up with
delegates _ and three out of every four belonged to Dukakis.
   The few remaining uncommitted officials seemed headed toward
Dukakis' camp. Virginia Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, for one, announced
his support in Richmond.
   Dukakis spent time in his Statehouse office in Boston, grappling
with budget difficulties for the current fiscal year and the one
just ended. He is expected to travel to Atlanta on Sunday, and will
be nominated for president three nights later.
   In conversations with reporters, Jackson said he would meet with
Dukakis ``at an appropriate time.'' He broke off negotiations on
the platform earlier in the week, after learning of Bentsen's
selection as the Democratic vice presidential candidate from a
reporter rather than from Dukakis.
   He also said Carter could help mediate ``at the appropriate
time,'' but his top aide, Ron Brown, seemed to back away from the
idea. Brown said that any role for Carter was ``not clear yet.''
   Even before the Democrats formally convened, Republicans were
working on their own convention, set to begin in New Orleans on
Aug. 15.
   The city won preliminary approval from the state's Bond
Commission to borrow up to $30 million to help pay its share of
convention costs.

<HEAD>Lehman Seeks Dismissal Of Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for former Navy Secretary John F.
Lehman Jr. asked a federal judge on Friday to dismiss a lawsuit
filed by an executive of a defense contracting company who says he
lost his job after publicly criticizing government spending.
   Other defendants in the lawsuit are Lehman's one-time deputies,
defense consultant Melvyn R. Paisley and assistant Navy Secretary
Everett Pyatt, and Carl Smith, a staffer with the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
   In the lawsuit, Lawrence J. Korb claims officials at Raytheon
Co. removed him from his position as vice president in the nation's
capital after they received complaints from Paisley and Pyatt about
Korb's public statements.
   Korb, who joined Raytheon in 1985, participated in a press
conference in February 1986 at which he suggested the Pentagon
could maintain a strong force with a smaller budget.
   After that, Paisley and Pyatt called Korb's superiors,
suggesting they tell the former Pentagon official to stop speaking
out against the president's budget.
   The Pentagon's inspector general concluded in a report released
in November 1986 that while Lehman did not direct Pyatt and Paisley
to called Raytheon, he erred in condoning their actions.
   The report said the three then-Navy officials were wrong in
complaining to Raytheon ``with the intention of restricting Dr.
Korb from making public statements.''
   But Lehman's attorney, Robert Bennett, told U.S. District Judge
Claude Hilton that there is ``simply no case against Lehman ... The
calls were made by two of his assistant secretaries.''
   Moreover, he said Navy officials have every right to express
their views to defense contractors.
   But Kate Martin, Korb's attorney, said that ``what these people
were doing was wrong ... putting pressure on Dr. Korb to keep
quiet.''
   Martin works for the American Civil Liberties Union, which is
representing Korb in his lawsuit in which he seeks $500,000 in
damages. Korb is now associated with the Brookings Institution, a
liberal think tank.
   Hilton said he would rule shortly on whether to dismiss the
lawsuit.
   The lawsuit is not related to the massive investigation into
defense procurement practices. Paisley is a key figure in that
probe, which centers on allegations that consultants paid bribes to
Pentagon officials to obtain classified information used to clinch
multimillion-dollar contracts.

<HEAD>Reagan Urges Further U.N. Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Friday the United
Nations must make ``further progress on reform'' to satisfy
concerns that have prompted the United States to withhold dues from
the world organization.
   Reagan's remarks to U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar were
relayed to reporters by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
after a meeting between the two officials.
   The United States has withheld about $44 million in current
contributions to the United Nations because of objections to its
budget and personnel procedures.
   ``The president said that the U.S. recognizes its obligations to
the U.N. but that further progress on reform was necessary to meet
the concerns of Congress, which the administration shares,''
Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said that Reagan hopes the problem of overdue U.S.
contributions to the world organization ``can be worked out.''
   The White House spokesman listed three areas in which the United
States desires U.N. reforms: the U.N. budget-making process, the
need for a 15 percent cut in U.N. personnel and the practice of
short-term contracting of Soviet U.N. employees so that they remain
under their government's control instead of becoming U.N. career
employees.
   Perez de Cuellar warned last last month that U.N. budget arrears
of $691 million, including $467 million run up by the United
States, would leave the organization out of money, with all its
reserves exhausted, by late October or early November. He was
expected to warn Reagan that the United Nations might be unable to
meet its payroll or other obligations.
   ``The secretary general was concerned that we have not been
forthcoming with our share,'' Fitzwater said.
   The $44 million was an amount the Reagan administration sought
to pay last year but Congress held up until Reagan certified
progress on reforming the U.N. budget decision-making process and
the two other areas of concern.
   Richard S. Williamson, U.S. assistant secretary of state for
international organizations, has described overall progress on U.N.
reforms as encouraging but suggested the demands of Congress have
not yet been fully met on the budget-decision making process.
   Posing for photographs with Perez de Cuellar, Reagan
acknowledged to reporters that recently there has been ``some
problem again with the Congress on this.''
   As the richest U.N. member, the United States is earmarked for
25 percent of the U.N. general budget. It has pressed for more
weighted voting by the major financial contributors on the U.N.
budget.
   Fitzwater said Reagan praised the secretary general for the U.N.
role in the Geneva accords on Afghanistan, saying that without U.N.
participation the agreement would not have been possible.
   Perez de Cuellar said the international organization would
continue to be active in Afghan refugee resettlement. The Soviet
Union and the Afghan government in Kabul have been accusing
Pakistan and the United States of violating the accord with
continuing help for the anti-Soviet guerrillas.
   Fitzwater said Reagan expressed regret over the shooting down of
an Iranian airliner by the U.S. cruiser Vincennes and thanked Perez
de Cuellar for his efforts to implement the yea-old Security
Council Resolution cutting off arms supplies to Iran and Iraq in
the Persian Gulf war.
   ``The president stressed the importance of the growing U.N. role
in controlling international production and trafficking of illicit
drugs,'' the spokesman said.
   The United Nations ``certainly can be influential in urging
other countries to take action in helping us with our initiatives
to eliminate (narcotics) crops and in enforcement measures against
drug traffic,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   Perez de Cuellar flew back to New York after the White House
meeting without speaking to reporters.

   Food shortages and illnesses caused by stress are
plaguing Armenians living in a disputed region trying to break away
from Azerbaijan, a resident and the state-run media reported Friday.
   One resident, a journalist with the state broadcasting
authority, claimed Azerbaijani authorities were preventing food
from getting to the region, Nagorno-Karabakh.
   ``We are under a virtual economic blockade,'' said the
journalist. ``The Azerbaijanis are trying to morally kill our
movement, to strike down our just demands.''
   The official news agency Tass, however, blamed the supply
problems in Nagorno-Karabakh on a nearly 2-month-old strike. Tass
said more than 130 freight cars and more than 300 containers of
food have backed up at the railway station in Stepanakert,
Nagorno-Karabakh's main city.
   ``There are no more fruits or vegetables in our shops,'' said
the reporter, who spoke on condition he not be identified by name.
``We have almost no economic ties now with Azerbaijan.''
   Ethnic Armenians make up more than three-quarters of
Nagorno-Karabakh's 160,000 people and most are Christian.
   They have complained for months of economic, cultural and
religious discrimination by the Azerbaijan government.
   Early this year, they began protesting and demanded that control
of the region, given to predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan in 1923, be
transferred to the neighboring republic of Armenia.
   In February, 32 people were killed in ethnic riots in Sumgait,
Azerbaijan, 26 of them Armenians.
   Tass said residents were suffering because of the tensions in
the region.
   ``The population of Stepanakert is exhausted by the situation
that has arisen. People have forgotten about weddings and family
holidays. The incidence of illnesses caused by excessive stress has
grown,'' the news agency reported.
   It said an Armenian resident was being sought after murdering
his wife and two relatives, seriously wounding a 2-year-old child
of his sister-in-law and trying to kill his son. Tass said the
suspect, G.S. Adamyan, has a criminal record but that the motive
for the attack was not known.
   The journalist said Azerbaijaini authorities refused Thursday to
allow a plane of the state-run airlines Aeroflot from the Armenian
capital of Yerevan to land in Stepanakert. Instead, the airliner
touched down in the Armenian city of Goris, he said.
   The Azerbaijanis, the journalist added, have suspended bus
service between Stepanakert and the Armenian cities of Kirovakan
and Kafan, but buses have been leaving Stepanakert for Yerevan with
a police escort.
   The legislature of the Delaware-size region voted Tuesday to
secede and join Armenia. But the Azerbaijani government voided the
decision within hours.
   A general strike in solidarity with Nagorno-Karabakh residents,
begun July 4, was continuing in Armenia, sources said.
   Khovik Vasilyan, an Armenian activist, said by telephone from
Yerevan that most of the factories in the city of 1.1 million
people were still on strike but that transportation was functioning
normally.
   Asked what the prospects were for resolving the 5-month-old
dispute, a woman reached by phone in Yerevan sighed and said: ``I
don't know what will happen. We are in a difficult situation.''
   Soviet television reported Friday that many workers at a Moscow
alarm clock factory were idle and not receiving pay because an
Armenian factory that makes electronic parts was on strike. The
newscast portrayed life as normal in Susha, the second biggest city
in Nagorno-Karabakh, despite what it said were rumors in
Stepanakert that Azerbaijani residents had attacked Armenians there.
   Armenian activists have scheduled a rally outside Yerevan's
repository of ancient Armenian manuscripts for Saturday night.
   They believe the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the highest
legislative body in the Soviet government, will meet Monday and
they hope it will consider the Nagorno-Karabakh question. Soviet
officials have said such a meeting is likely but have not given a
date.
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, said Thursday the work
stoppage in Armenia had cost $65 million in lost production and
that $29 million worth of construction had not been completed.
   Tass said that about 20,000 Azerbaijanis living in Armenia had
fled to Azerbaijan and that as of Wednesday, 7,265 Armenians who
once lived in Sumgait and other Azerbaijan cities had returned to
Armenia.

<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann
reluctantly yielded Friday to a Reagan administration demand that
he leave the country, departing five minutes ahead of the deadline
imposed by the State Department.
   But he took a parting shot at the administration, insisting that
the U.S. action threatened the independence of the Organization of
American States and saying his leftist government would seek
recourse through OAS legal channels.
   Speaking at a crowded embassy news conference shortly before
leaving for the airport, Tunnermann said defiance of the expulsion
order could give the Reagan administration an excuse ``to continue
its aggression against our people.''
   Tunnermann and seven embassy colleagues were notified of the
expulsion on Tuesday and were given until 5:30 p.m. EDT Friday to
leave the country. They flew to Mexico City via Houston on a 5:25
p.m. flight and planned to go to Managua on Saturday.
   About a dozen police officers were stationed at the Continental
Airlines plane's gate at Washington National Airport. Two police
vehicles followed the jet out onto the taxiway, then pulled out to
the head of the runway and waited for it to take off.
   Tunnermann's wife, Rosa, who accompanied the envoy to news
conference, said she and seven of the couple's children plan to
remain in the Washington area.
   The State Department acted after eight American diplomats,
including Ambassador Richard Melton, were ordered home by the
Nicaraguan government on Monday for alleged interference in the
country's internal affairs.
   The administration described the U.S. response as retaliatory
and said that in the case of Tunnermann and Nicaragua's military
attache, Major Pedro Sampson, the expulsion was also based on
``abuses'' of their privilege of residence.
   Tunnermann served as both ambassador to the United States and
the OAS and maintained throughout that the United States had no
right to expel him, citing guarantees contained in the OAS charter.
   The charter states that attendance at OAS meetings shall ``not
depend on bilateral relations'' between any member state and the
United States, which is host country for the OAS.
   But the administration said a separate agreement between the
United States and the OAS authorizes the U.S. government to order
any OAS diplomat home.
   Tunnermann repeatedly challenged U.S. officials to present
evidence of the wrongdoing he and Sampson were alleged to have
engaged in. The administration has steadfastly refused, saying it
was under no obligation to provide details.
   On Thursday, the U.S. ambassador to the OAS, Richard McCormack,
said the administration had deferred expelling Tunnermann and
Sampson earlier in order to avoid giving the Nicaraguan government
a pretext for ordering home U.S. diplomats.
   He added that the expulsion of the eight Americans this week
``removed the basis for such restraint on the part of the United
States.''
   Tunnermann took his case to the OAS permanent council on
Thursday but received little more than a polite hearing from most
of his 31 colleagues there.
   A statement issued in the name of seven Latin American
governments acknowledged that the rights of ambassadors against
arbitrary expulsion are not adequately protected and said ``it is
necessary to fill this legal vacuum.''
   Tunnermann, who spent 3{ years here, said the United States
should not have ``veto power'' over OAS appointees and that
Nicaragua would take action to defend the rights of ambassadors to
immunity.
   Sofia Clark, an embassy counselor, read a statement at the news
conference in which she said the United States had set a
``dangerous precedent'' that threatened the independence of the OAS.
   Had Tunnermann chosen to remain in defiance of the order, he
apparently would have been considered as an illegal alien. Even
though U.S. law protects such aliens against summary expulsion and
guarantees them a hearing, Tunnermann elected to leave the country.
He said, however, that he still considers himself to be Nicaragua's
ambassador.
   Shortly before the news conference, President Reagan said he
expected Tunnermann to observe comply with the expulsion order by
the deadline.
   Asked what the U.S. government would do if Tunnermann defied the
deadline, Reagan told reporters, ``We're expecting him to leave at
that hour. Beyond that hour, he is here illegally.''
   ``I don't know where he'll hide,'' the president said,
indicating the government would enforce its expulsion order if
necessary. ``He's illegally here beyond that period of time. We
expect him to be going to the airport or to leave.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Defends Use of Taxes and Borrowing to Close State Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis defended his use of taxes
and borrowing to cover a state budget shortfall as he awaited final
legislative action on the plan before heading to the Democratic
convention.
   In an interview Friday with The Associated Press in his
Statehouse office, Dukakis rejected any comparisons between his
borrowing and the federal deficit spending of the Reagan
administration.
   ``Obviously, we're not going to do anything around here that
jeopardizes our credit rating. If all goes well, we'll come out of
this with some end-of-year surplus,'' Dukakis predicted.
   He also defended his recent signing of a $24 million sales tax
on cigarettes on the grounds that it would pay for the first year
phase-in of his universal health care plan.
   ``If we didn't have the health care bill, we wouldn't have
needed that. Frankly, I think that's a modest price to pay for the
first universal health care bill in the history of this country,''
the governor said.
   He acknowledged, however, that the cigarette tax would not pay
for universal health insurance in later years when the program
becomes more expensive. He did not address himself to the other
revenue measures proposed to shore up next year's state budget.
   Dukakis did show a willingness to tangle with George Bush if the
expected Republican presidential nominee accuses him of being a
tax-raiser.
   ``Let 'em do it,'' said Dukakis, who recently accused Bush of
violating a no-new-taxes pledge by supporting a federal
catastrophic illness health care bill that calls for $6 billion in
new revenues.
   ``I haven't heard much the last week or two from the vice
president on the subject, since his no-tax pledge has disappeared.
And I don't think you're going to hear much,'' Dukakis said.
   As he spoke Friday afternoon, an $11.75 billion budget for the
current fiscal year was awaiting his signature. Dukakis said he
would use his line-item veto to reduce the total, but he would not
say how.
   At the same time, Dukakis is awaiting a package of bills
designed to close a deficit in last year's budget that ranges from
the administration's estimate of $370 million to as much as $470
million projected by some legislators.
   Dukakis has proposed closing the budget gap through converting
some $200 million in operating expenses into long-term bonds,
tapping a $27 million pension system surplus and diverting $50
million in surplus lottery proceeds from local government.
   In addition, to shore up next year's budget, the governor is
seeking to raise more than $200 million by closing corporate tax
``loopholes,'' re-coupling the state income tax with federal law
and collecting unclaimed bottle deposits.
   The governor traced his budget problems to an unanticipated _
and, he says, unforeseeble _ downturn in state tax collections this
spring.
   ``Remember this,'' he said, ``The Revenue Advisory Board, as
recently as three months ago, gave us a revised report, which
forecast a $70 million shortfall for FY88 and a $40 million
shortfall for FY89.
   ``Now, if that revised forecast had been accurate, it would have
been like a day at the beach,'' Dukakis said.
   According to the governor, he and legislative leaders made a
decision last year to take advantage of the now-evaporated state
budget surplus by paying cash for some highway and building repair
projects that normally would have been funded through bonds.
   Now, faced with a shortfall, Dukakis said he is simply shifting
the funds back into a category where they belonged all along.

<TEXT>
   In a new reaction to the ongoing Pentagon
fraud investigation, the Defense Department announced Friday it is
requiring ``special procedures'' for future contracts with 16
defense firms.
   The procedures will include a certification that none of the
companies improperly obtained inside information relating to
contracts, the Pentagon said.
   The contractors also will be required to include a clause in
contracts permitting the government to recapture profits if it is
later determined the company won the contract through ``illegal or
improper activity,'' the Pentagon said.
   The announcement results from the investigation into allegations
that private defense consultants, many of whom are former military
or Pentagon officials, paid bribes to current Pentagon employees
for inside information about contracts.
   That information could be crucial in winning contracts worth
hundreds of millions of dollars. No charges have yet been filed in
the two-year-old case, which became public a month ago when search
warrants were served across the country on a number of contractors
and consultants.
   The Pentagon announcement said the procedures will affect future
contracts worth more than $100,000 and is ``an interim measure
designed to protect the government's interests.''
   The Defense Department said the list of 16 companies could be
expanded ``as additional information becomes available.''
   The Pentagon said it was acting because the contractors, or
their subsidiaries, ``either were the subject of search warrants in
connection with the ongoing procurement investigation, or other
official information currently available that requires
certification of business integrity prior to awarding of future
contracts.''
   The list includes some of the nation's largest defense
contractors, including McDonnell Douglas, Northrop, Unisys,
Teledyne Electronics, and United Technologies.
   Two weeks ago, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci announced he
was suspending contracts in nine military programs worth $1 billion
because of the possibility they may have been tainted. He said he
was acting on the basis of information contained in an affidavit
unsealed by a federal court in Dallas.
   Carlucci rescinded that action Monday and told Congress a review
of the contracts had found no problems with the pacts.
   But he also said action should be taken as a warning to
contractors that the Pentagon would act if questions were raised
about future contracts.
   Carlucci and other Pentagon officials have said the Pentagon has
the legal authority to recoup profits if the money turns out to
have been earned through some illegality. But members of Congress
have been pushing for inclusion of a separate clause in future
contracts to spell out that right more clearly.
   The firms affected by Friday's announcement include Armtec Inc.,
Palatka, Fla.; Cubic Corp., San Diego, Calif.; Emhart Corp.,
Hartford, Conn.; Executive Resource Associates, Arlington, Va.;
Hazeltine Corp., Commack, N.Y.; Kane Paper Corp., Baldwin, N.Y.;
Litton Data Systems, Van Nuys, Calif.; Loral Aircraft, Akron, Ohio.
   McDonnell Douglas, St. Louis; Northrop Corp., Newbury Park,
Calif.; Teledyne Electronics, Newbury Park, Calif.; Unisys Corp.,
Detroit, Mich.; United Technologies, Hartford, Conn.; Varian
Associates, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.; Whittaker Corp., Farmington,
Ariz.; Zubier Enterprises, Harrisburg, Pa.

<HEAD>Get Rid of Cash-Based Accounting in U.S. Government, GAO Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government should adopt uniform
accounting principles to replace some 200 separate, antiquated
systems it now uses, and create a chief financial officer to
oversee the entire financial picture, according to a report
released Thursday.
   ``There is a recognition today that most of the government's
accounting systems are outdated, inefficient and ineffective, and
that improvements in financial management are urgently needed,''
said the report by the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative branch.
   ``Getting this GAO report is really important because it
confirms our worst fears,'' said Rep. Joseph DioGuardi, R-N.Y., who
says he is the only practicing certified public accountant in
Congress. ``There are so many aspects to what is structurally and
systemically wrong.''
   DioGuardi and Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, released the report at
a news conference. The report had been requested by Craig, the
ranking Republican on the Government Operations subcommittee on
commerce, consumer and monetary affairs.
   Among the report's recommendations:
   _Create a federal chief financial officer within the Treasury
Department who would have the power to oversee and direct the
financial management, accounting and budget systems of the federal
government;
   _Prepare audited financial statements every year in every major
department and agency;
   _Change from the current cash-basis (one-year) accounting system
to a long and short term, or accrual, system;
   _Adopt uniform accounting systems in every department and major
agency, replacing the more than 200 systems now in use.
   ``We've got to get some better accountability, some better
controls and some better information,'' said Frederick D. Wolf,
director of GAO's accounting and financial management division, who
attended the news conference.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev spent
Friday in closed meetings with other Warsaw Pact leaders, and his
wife Raisa visited Auschwitz, where 4 million people were killed in
Nazi death camps.
   Gorbachev's proposals for new efforts to break a deadlock with
NATO over reducing conventional forces in Europe, already rejected
by the United States, were among the topics for discussion in the
first of two days of private talks.
   A brief official report of the proceedings said Gorbachev and
the other leaders addressed the opening-day session, but gave no
details. They met in the Council of Ministers Palace, where the
Treaty of Warsaw was signed in 1955 to formalize the political and
military alliance.
   The official news agency PAP later reported dinner toasts by
Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania and Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Ceausescu called for talks aimed at eliminating short-range
nuclear missiles in Europe _ those with ranges up to 300 miles,
which are not included in the U.S.-Soviet treaty to scrap
medium-range weapons, the agency said.
   Jaruzelski said Gorbachev's proposals for talks on reducing
conventional forces were ``valuable, original initiatives'' and
were discussed in the first day's session.
   Mrs. Gorbachev returned to southern Poland, which the Gorbachevs
visited earlier in the week, to memorialize those who died during
World War II in the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp.
   She laid bouquets of red carnations at Execution Wall and at the
Russian-language tablet that is part of an international monument
to the dead.
   Wiping a tear from her cheek, Mrs. Gorbachev said after touring
the camp that almost 50 years since the beginning of World War II
the camp still reminds the living of ``the hope, human fear and
bravery'' of its inmates.
   ``It should remind us all that what is most precious in this
world is the right to live and be free,'' she said in brief remarks
broadcast by state television.
   Soviet forces liberated Auschwitz, built by the Germans after
they occupied Poland at the beginning of the war, in January 1945
and it has been preserved as a museum. The gas chambers and
crematoria of Birkenau were largely destroyed by retreating German
forces, and the site is marked by a stone monument and tablets in
many languages.
   The combined camp was the center of Hitler's effort to wipe out
European Jews, millions of whom lived in Poland and Nazi-occupied
regions of the Soviet Union.
   Next to Poles, both Jew and Christian, more than 1 million
Soviet citizens made up the largest single nationality among the
victims. Soviet prisoners of war received particularly harsh
treatment in the slave-labor sections of the complex.
   News coverage of Mrs. Gorbachev's visit, the first event of the
six-day visit to Poland when she did not accompany her husband, was
restricted to Soviet and Polish media.
   The meeting of the Warsaw Pact's political-consultative council
is the first since the fourth Gorbachev-Reagan summit six weeks ago
in Moscow.
   It also was the Soviet leader's first opportunity to brief his
allies on the Soviet Union's national Communist Party conference at
the end of June, which reiterated his policy of encouraging
economic and social reform.
   When he arrived Monday, Gorbachev proposed that negotiators from
East and West meet informally to seek ways of breaking the impasse
that for years has blocked mutual reductions of conventional forces
in Europe.
   Washington issued a statement saying appropriate forums already
exist in Vienna and elsewhere for discussing arms reduction and
that any such talks should include representatives of all NATO
countries.
   The U.S. response was equally cool to Gorbachev's suggestion
that the Soviet Union would withdraw an unspecified number of its
military aircraft from Eastern Europe if NATO drops a plan to
redeploy 72 American F-16s from Spain to Italy.

<TEXT>
   In more than a half-century as a Teamster, William
J. McCarthy learned the highways around New England and the paths
to power and did it with a tough but low-key style.
   ``He's not the type to make a lot of publicity,'' said Robert
DeRusha, secretary-treasurer of the Joint Council 10, which
represents 55,000 Teamsters in New England. ``He works hard and
cares about the union movement. He's respected by everyone here,
but he keeps a low profile.''
   Such anonymity may be difficult now for McCarthy, 69, who was
selected president of the nation's largest labor union Friday by
the Teamsters' 17-member General Executive Board over
Secretary-Treasurer Weldon Mathis, whom former union President
Jackie Presser had named acting president May 4. Presser, 61, who
died of cancer Saturday, had been under federal indictment on
charges of labor racketeering and embezzlement.
   McCarthy takes control of a 1.6 million-member union that
routinely makes headlines for its influence in political campaigns
and reputed links to organized crime.
   McCarthy is one of 19 present and former Teamster leaders named
defendants in a government suit trying to seize control of the
union through a court-appointed trustee, claiming its leadership is
either controlled by organized crime figures or incapable of
removing its influence.
   Among the allegations in the suit, filed two weeks ago, is that
mob bosses in Chicago and New York were behind the elevation of Roy
Williams to the union's presidency in 1981 and supported Presser in
1983.
   McCarthy, who has a reputation of being a tough negotiator with
a quick temper, will serve out the remainder of Presser's five-year
term, which expires in 1991 when the union holds its next
international convention.
   Apart from the latest federal takeover suit and several
investigations of alleged Teamster misconduct in the early 1980s,
McCarthy has ruled the New England Teamsters without much public
scrutiny.
   ``I think his reputation as a hard-working, well-organized
leader had a lot to do with his selection,'' said Arthur Osborn,
president of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO. ``I think anyone under fire
wants to look to turn things around. They think McCarthy is the
best person to motivate that union and move it forward.''
   McCarthy began his full-time union activity in the early 1940s
negotiating contracts and handling grievances as the youngest
business agent ever at Local 25 in Boston's Charlestown section.
   By the mid-1960s, he had risen to secretary-treasurer of the New
England Joint Council and was elected president four years later.
He will retain the regional post in addition to his national
responsibilities, said DeRusha.
   Upward career mobility also allowed McCarthy to move from
Charlestown to suburban Arlington, where he raised four children
and lives with his wife, Mary.
   In early 1982, McCarthy was called to testify in a 31-count
federal case against three members of Teamsters Local 25 accused of
defrauding movie outfits filming in Boston by arranging pay for
absent union members.
   The next year, McCarthy and eight other trustees in the New
England Teamster Pension fund agreed to pay $205,000 as settlement
of a U.S. Labor Department suit that alleged the trustees violated
federal regulations by allowing the fund's investment advisor to
receive commissions on real estate investments.
   There are no other current Labor Department investigations that
include McCarthy, according to a department spokesman in Boston.
   Roy Herrick, who worked with McCarthy for nearly 45 years,
believes his appointment may help stem problems at the Teamsters.
   ``He's come from the bottom to the very top and he knows what it
is to take hard knocks and barely have enough to eat,'' said
Herrick, 70, president of the 1,100-member Local 25 retirees
chapter. ``He's a hard man and a tough negotiator, but he's fair.
He's a Teamster's Teamster. That's what we need now.''

   Natalya Solzhenitsyn, the wife of Soviet

homeland for a visit and that his works would be published there.
   ``Everything is (a) lie. Everything is false,'' Mrs.
Solzhenitsyn said in a telephone interview with The Associated
Press from her home in Cavendish, Vt.
   The Munich-based Bayerischer Rundfunk radio station said
Solzhenitsyn and his wife planned to visit the Soviet Union in
November or December and that the Soviet Union wanted to publish
all his works, including the novella ``Cancer Ward'' and ``The
Gulag Archipelago.''
   It said the information came from its correspondent in New York
City.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, the New York-based
correspondent said Solzhenitsyn's wife told him by telephone
Wednesday that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev had written two
letters to her husband with offers to return and to have
Solzhenitsyn's works published in the Soviet Union. The
correspondent asked that his name not be used.
   Mrs. Solzhenitsyn said, ``I never talked to (an) unnamed
reporter from New York.''
   ``I cannot confirm (the report),'' she said. She also said she
could not speculate on the report's origin or motive. ``I have no
idea. I have no comment at all.''
   Earlier, Mrs. Solzhenitsyn, who rarely speaks to reporters,
spoke to an aide to U.S. Rep. James Jeffords, R-Vt., and denied
that her husband had received letters from Gorbachev.
   The aide, Bernice Murray, quoted her as saying, ``It's a lie.
The interviews never took place ... It's absurd.''
   Solzhenitsyn incurred the wrath of the Soviet Union's Communist
leadership with novels such as ``One Day in the Life of Ivan
Denisovich,'' ``Cancer Ward'' and ``The First Circle,'' as well as
the non-fiction work ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' an expose of terror
and hopelessness in Soviet labor camps.
   He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970.
   In February 1974, Solzhenitsyn was arrested, formally accused of
treason, stripped of his citizenship and deported to the West.
   In June, Sergei P. Zalygin, editor of the Soviet monthly Novy
Mir, said negotiations for publishing ``Cancer Ward'' in the Soviet
Union were under way.
   However, Mrs. Solzhenitsyn was quoted by The New York Times as
saying at the time that Soviet officials had not approached
Solzhenitsyn about publishing any of his works in the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>More Record-Breaking Heat in Midwest; Storms Around Omaha</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Temperature records continue to fall Friday in parts of the
Midwest and East, and severe storms injured several people, damaged
buildings and knocked out power in the Omaha, Neb., area and parts
of Florida and Michigan.
   By early aftenoon, readings passing the century mark were common
across the Arizona and California deserts, as well as portions of
Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, South Carolina and West Virginia.
   The temperature reached 102 in Chicago on Friday, beating an
11-year-old record by 3 degrees. Another record fell there, too: It
was the fifth time this year that temperatures had reached triple
digits in the Windy City, more than any other year on record.
   In Pittsburgh, the thermometer reached 91 degrees by early
afternoon to make the 12th consecutive day of 90 degree or greater
temperatures. This equals the record string of 90-degree days set
in July 1881.
   Other temperature records were set in Eau Claire, Wis., 101,
besting the 1936 record by 1 degree; La Crosse, Wis., 102, beating
the 1931 record by 3 degrees; Madison, Wis., 98, beating the 1901
record by 2 degrees; and Rockford, Ill., 101, beating the 1932
record by 1 degree. Records were tied in Minneapolis-St. Paul, 101;
and in Cape Hatteras, N.C., 90.
   In Council Bluffs, Iowa, thunderstorms packing tornadoes caused
extensive damage in a residential area. At least eight people were
reported being treated at hospitals at Council Bluffs, officials
said. Most of the injuries were described as minor.
   Strong winds associated with the storms downed trees and broke
windows and wind and lightning caused scattered power outages
throughout the Omaha metropolitan area, of which Council Bluffs is
a part. A wind gust of 92 mph was reported at Omaha's Eppley
Airfield, the weather service reported.
   A severe thunderstorm watch continued in effect for parts of
Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Missouri.
   Elsewhere, heavy rain caused street flooding in parts of the
Florida panhandle early in the afternoon, and small trees, limbs
and signs were reported blown down. At least two persons were hit
by lightning.
   Earlier Friday, strong thunderstorms, sometimes accompanied by
hail, moved through northern Wisconsin and the northern half of
Michigan. One person suffered a broken leg when thunderstorm winds
downed a tree in Vilas County, Wis., the National Weather Service
said.
   A waterspout moved onshore at St. Petersburg Beach, Fla.,
causing minor roof damage to one house.
   Heavier rainfall for the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT included
0.83 inch at Grand Island, Neb.; 0.74 inch at Green Bay, Wis.; 0.58
inch at Gwinn, Mich.; 0.48 inch at Hancock, Mich.; and 0.44 inch at
Marquette, Mich.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 61
degrees at Crescent City, Calif., to 106 degrees at Glendale, Ariz.
Friday's morning low was 39 degrees at Truckee, Calif., and
Missoula, Mont.
   The national weather forecast for Saturday called for scattered
showers and thunderstorms from the central and southern High Plains
through the middle Mississippi Valley, the Ohio Valley to the
mid-Atlantic Coast. The storms will be most numerous across the
eastern Great Lakes and New England. Afternoon showers and
thunderstorms also were forecast in much of the Southeast.
   Highs above 100 were forecast across Missouri and Kansas, and in
the desert Southwest and interior valleys of California; in the 70s
and 80s from the Pacific Northwest into western Montana, and from
the northern Great Lakes into New England; and in the 90s across
most of the rest of the nation.

   Texas state Treasurer Ann Richards said Friday
she will talk about the American family, the Republican record and
her admiration for both Michael Dukakis and his rival, Jesse
Jackson, in her keynote address at the Democratic National
Convention.
   Richards, 54, said the Democrats are more unified than at any
other time in her lifetime, despite the rift that developed this
week between the Jackson and Dukakis camps over Dukakis' failure to
notify Jackson in advance of his selection of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas as his running mate.
   ``What you have here are two superb leaders, two bright
individuals, two of our party's best. And I think that, whatever
the difficulties, they will be able to resolve those,'' she said of
Dukakis and Jackson.
   Richards said at a news conference that she did not intend to
focus in her Monday night speech on the estrangement that Jackson
has been feeling from the Dukakis campaign. Since the dispute over
Dukakis' running mate occurred on Tuesday, contacts between the two
campaigns have been initiated to discuss Jackson's role in the
Democrats' plans for November.
   ``I'm going to talk about Jesse Jackson because I think he's
been a passionate, energetic and exciting voice in this country and
I want to compliment him for that,'' Richards said.
   Mentioning general themes of her speech without revealing
specifics, Richard said she would speak about GOP nominee-to-be
George Bush and the last eight years under a Republican
administration and will laud the records of Dukakis, Bentsen and
Jackson.
   She said she also would talk about ``the American family,'' an
issue popular this year with both Republicans and Democrats,
liberals and conservatives. ``It's something I feel like I've
lived,'' she said.
   She noted the dramatic, crowd-rousing speech given by New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo at the Democratic convention four years ago and
said the issues he talked about _ such as homelessness, drugs and
ghettos _ still are important in the country.
   Well known for her crowd-pleasing speaking style, Richards said
she did not expect to match Cuomo's effort.
   ``I kind of feel like a student who is facing final exams and
knowing that this one is important, this one is tough and I had
better be prepared for it,'' she said. ``So I'm still cramming and
doing some finishing touches and will be ready to open the
convention Monday night.''
   Richards has been state treasurer since 1982, and was the first
woman elected to a statewide office in Texas in 50 years when she
assumed the post.

<HEAD>Thailand to Move Cambodian Refugees Closer to Border</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities will begin moving about
17,000 Cambodian refugees from the Khao-I-Dang camp to a location
closer to the Thai-Cambodian border, a military commander said
Friday.
   The United States and other countries have expressed concern
about the refugees' safety if they are moved from Khao-I-Dang, whic
is eight miles from the frontier.
   Thousands of Cambodians have entered Thailand to escape the war
in their country between guerrilla forces and Vietnamese and
government troops. Vietnam sent troops into Cambodia in December
1978, ousted the radical Khmer Rouge regime and installed another
communist government.
   Most of the Cambodians settled in camps along the border, and
Khao-I-Dang is considered the only refugee camp not controlled by
the differerent guerrilla groups. It also is the only camp where
there is an official program to resettle the refugees in other
countries.
   Thailand had declared on Dec. 31, 1986, that it would close
Khao-I-Dang, but only a small number of refugees were forced to
leave.
   Col. Sanan Kajornklam, of the Supreme Command's Joint Operations
Center, spoke of moving the refugees at a meeting Friday.
   Later, in an interview with The Associated Press, Sanan said
that within three months authorities will start moving the
Khao-I-Dang refugees to the area of Site 2 close to the border.
Site 2 adjoins the Ban Thad camp where the government, trying to
discourage more Indochinese from entering Thailand, has placed
about 3,000 Vietnamese refugees.
   Sanan said the Khao-I-Dang refugees would be resettled because
they have not been accepted by other countries and they must
prepare to return to Cambodia.
   ``If we close Khao-I-Dang, the Cambodians will know that they
must go home,'' Sanan said.
   Kobsak Chutikul, director of the Foreign Ministry's Social
Afffairs Division, said that in its plans to move the Khao-I-Dang
refugees the government will follow three objectives that U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar outlined in a letter to
the government last year.
   He said those objectives are that the new site be safe, that it
be neutral and that the refugees remain under the protection of the
office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.

   A company accused of reneging on a drought
insurance offer said Friday it would issue an additional $10
million in total coverage for farmers in 10 Midwest states.
   But one insurance official said Federal Insurance Co.'s plan was
unacceptable.
   Federal, a subsidiary of Warren-based Chubb Group Insurance
Cos., has been accused of backing off a promise to issue policies
that pay off if rainfall falls below a certain level.
   Chubb says the flood of applications in the final days of the
enrollment period, which lasted from May 1 to June 17, exceeded the
amount of coverage it wanted to provide, and that it cannot fill
all the applications.
   The company initially planned to issue $30 million but increased
the total coverage to $40 million, which will protect about 800
farmers. Chubb said Friday it made the decision after talking with
insurance commissioners in the affected states.
   The 6,000 farmers who do not receive insurance will get twice
the amount of their premium returned, said Chubb spokeswoman Mary
Lu Korkuch. Premiums already have been returned to insurance
agents, she said.
   Another 1,000 farmers whose applications were received June 16
or later will get only their premium back, she said.
   ``(Farmers) aren't losing money,'' she said. ``They just might
not get the insurance they want.''
   Applications for about $350 million in total coverage are not
being accepted because they exceed the $40 million limit, she said.
   Chubb said Friday any assertion that it was bound to accept all
applications was ``without merit'' and would be subject to a ``very
vigorous defense.'' The company said nearly all the applications
clearly indicate that policies would be issued only after
acceptance by the insurer.
   ``It's hogwash,'' Iowa Insurance Commissioner William Hager said
of that contention.
   ``The application form we approved for use in Iowa specifically
provides that once the premium is submitted, coverage is bound,''
Hager said.
   ``We simply are not going to tolerate, by analogy, a company
that issues a policy, finds out that the building is burning and
says, `Whoops we really didn't mean we were going to cover the
loss,''' the Iowa commissioner said.
   Iowa and Ohio officials said their states are prepared to take
legal action if necessary, while Minnesota will seek to revoke the
company's state license to do business if it does not provide the
coverage.
   An estimated 450 Ohio farmers applied and sent in premiums for
the insurance, said Neil Rector, deputy director of the Ohio
Department of Insurance. About 10 percent of them would be covered
under Chubb's proposal, he said.
   Minnesota Commerce Commissioner Michael Hatch estimates 1,000
farmers from his state applied for a total of $40 million in
coverage.
   Other states whose farmers sought the coverage are Indiana,
Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Tennessee and
Wisconsin.
   ``We increased our capacity for this program from $30 million to
$40 million in the hope that this additional coverage will provide
help to Midwestern farmers during this very difficult period,''
Chubb said in a written statement.
   Lawsuits have been filed against Chubb by Indiana farmers,
alleging the company acted in bad faith by reneging on the
insurance. And some farmers in Tennessee and Kentucky told an agent
to send the premium refunds back to Chubb and demand the coverage
be provided.
   Rector said Chubb has not been threatened with license
revocation in Ohio, but ``we've told them that the department's
position is they're on the hook.''
   Ms. Korkuch said she could not comment on the lawsuits and said
they have not been resolved. She also said she had no comment on
what the company would do if farmers refuse to accept the refunds.

   An 8-year-old boy who had no heartbeat and a
body temperature of only 70 degrees after spending four hours
trapped in a freezer died Friday, 21 hours after he was discovered
by his father, hospital officials said.
   Although medical personnel had managed to get Joseph Krogg's
heart beating and return his body temperature to normal, he made no
further progress, said Jane Yousey, spokeswoman for Rainbow Babies'
and Children's Hospital.
   ``He was put on life support, and he never regained
consciousness,'' Ms. Yousey said.
   When Joseph arrived at St. Joseph Hospital in Lorain at 7 p.m.
Thursday, Emergency Room Dr. Stephen Evans told the boy's father,
Dale Krogg, the chances of resuscitating him were one in a million.
Icicles had formed on his body, and his heart had stopped beating.
   But doctors began an elaborate process of rewarming Joseph's
body by running tubes of warm saline through his stomach and
bladder and wrapping him in electric blankets.
   About 11 p.m., Joseph's heart began to beat again, and by 1 a.m.
Friday he had a strong pulse and good blood pressure and his
temperature returned to normal, Evans said.
   The youth was then air-lifted 35 miles to Rainbow Babies' and
Children's Hospital in Cleveland, where he died at 4:02 p.m. Friday.
   The youth was reported missing by his parents around 5 p.m.
Thursday, said Detective Sgt. Joe Monia of the Sheffield Lake
Police Department. His father found him at 6:30 p.m. when he went
to the freezer in the family's garage to get meat for dinner.
   Joseph had apparently fallen into the freezer while trying to
reach some Popsicles, Monia said. A discarded battery had been
pushed in front of the freezer to act as a step for the youth, he
said.
   ``It appears he crawled up on the battery and tumbled in,''
Monia said. ``The lid closed on him and latched.''
   Because of the location of the freezer, any pounding or yelling
would not be heard by anyone, the father said.
   Evans said doctors believed it a miracle the boy survived as
long as he did.
   While some drowning victims have revived after up to an hour in
similar freezing conditions, said Evans, ``we've never had anyone
survive so long. This is what makes it so unusual.''

<HEAD>Namphy Announces Decentralization Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haitian leader Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy decreed on state television Friday night what he described
as a decentralization program aimed at helping the poor.
   Namphy said the National Bureau of Small Projects Coordination
Program, led by a coordinator and 77 advisers, is aimed at
encouraging the poor to ``be the artisans of their own destiny'' by
taking part in local decision-making.
   The bureau will coordinate small-scale development projects,
such as the building of latrines, wells, lower-class living
quarters and repairing roads.
   Namphy ousted President Leslie Manigat after only four months of
civilian rule in a coup on June 19.
   His plan is highly similar to the development program Manigat
outlined in his platform, calling for decentralized decision-making
and self-help projects in the countryside.
   Namphy said in his 10-minute speech Friday,``The government has
decided to implant a dynamic administrative structure ... in
accordance with the demands of the population.''
   Namphy added that Haiti's social inequalities are ``clearly
unacceptable.''
   Most Haitians earn less than $300 a year each, making this
Caribbean nation of 6 million the poorest in the Americas. Haiti
shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic.
   The general said his program ``calls for the direct
participation of everyone. This form of decentralization is a
school for democracy.''
   The decree says the bureau's mission ``consists in facilitating
the voluntary participation of the rural population by identifying
their needs, defining priorities and executing small projects
selected by the executive.''
   In a speech in June in which Namphy announced his intention to
do away with the constitution overwhelmingly approved by Haitians
in March 1987, the general said Haitians were too poor to enjoy
democracy.
   ``It is obviously illusory to think that the full enjoyment of .
.. rights and liberties is possible in the context of absolute
poverty in which nearly 70 percent of the population of the country
is vegetating,'' he said then.
   Friday's decree was the second major one since Namphy took power
last month. On July 12, the government abolished the death penalty,
though it had already been abolished in the 1987 constitution.

   A Canadian delegation is in Iran to
discuss the possible normalization of diplomatic relations severed
in 1980, according to a brief report by Tehran radio.
   The report, monitored in Britain, said the Canadians arrived
Friday but gave no details.
   Canada closed its embassy in Tehran in 1980 in the furor over
the holding of 52 American hostages at the U.S. Embassy for 444
days. The captives were freed and flew home in January 1980.
   Iran had denounced Canada for sheltering a few Americans in the
Canadian Embassy during the hostage crisis.
   Denmark handled Canadian interests in Iran after diplomatic
relations were broken.
   Indications have emerged that Iran, at war with Iraq since
September 1980, is trying to improve relations with other countries.

   The murder of a 19-year-old black woman
whose body was found with ``KKK'' carved on her leg is being
investigated as possibly racially motivated, a prosecutor said
Friday.
   District Attorney Michael Kavanagh said he talked with Gov.
Mario Cuomo about the case Friday and Cuomo had pledged ``full
support of state resources'' to help with the case.
   Anna Kithcart, 19, was found dead Tuesday, but information about
the letters on her leg were not released until Thursday. The
letters were written with a sharp instrument, said Kavanagh, who
refused to comment on many aspects of the investigation.
   ``As far as racial involvement, we are concerned,'' Kavanagh
said. ``We are concerned.''
   Preliminary autopsy results indicated Miss Kithcart was
strangled and struck on the head with a blunt instrument, police
said. A bite on the neck and other marks also were found on her
body.
   Miss Kithcart had last been seen Monday evening at the Royal
Grill, a few doors down from the alleyway where her blood-stained
sweatsuit was found. Her partly clothed body was found another
block away.
   While Kavanagh wouldn't comment on reports that Miss Kithcart
was a drug addict, the woman's father told the Kingston Daily
Freeman that his daughter had fallen victim to drugs.
   ``I'm almost positive it was a drug rub,'' Kithcart told the
newspaper.
   The only arrest in the case came Wednesday, when a man police
described as a transient was charged with engaging in sexual
contact with Miss Kithcart's corpse.
   Joseph Kiernan, 41, being held on $10,000 bail, told radio
station WDST in Woodstock Thursday night that he was innocent of
any charges and thought Miss Kithcart's body was a life-sized,
pornographic doll when he saw it.
   ``I never saw a dead body before,'' Kiernan said. ``I looked
down and touched it and it felt like rubber, sort of warm and sort
of cold.''
   Kiernan said when he saw the head wound, he ``flipped out'' and
ran to call police.
   While Kiernan was being questioned, Kavanagh said Friday that
there was still no suspect in the murder.
   There are ``similiarities'' between the murder and the Tawana
Brawley case, but there was no evidence of a connection in the
cases, Kavanagh said.
   Miss Brawley, 16, of Wappingers Falls was found last November
with the letters ``KKK'' and racial epithets scrawled in a
charcoal-like substance on her skin after being missing for four
days. She later said she had been abducted and raped by a group of
white men, but she and her family have refused to cooperate with
the investigation.
   Kingston is about 25 miles north of Wappingers Falls, on the
opposite shore of the Hudson River.
   On Friday, Brawley advisers the Rev. Al Sharpton and lawyer
Alton Maddox arrived at the Ulster County Jail to conduct what they
said would be their own investigation of the murder.
   ``If our investigation leads to the Kingston Police Department,
then we'll go there,'' Maddox said.
   Kavanagh said the Brawley advisers' appearance in Kingston was
``a nightmare come true.''
   State Attorney General Robert Abrams, the special prosecutor in
the Brawley case, said he would push the grand jury investigating
it to begin writing a report next month on what it believes
happened to the black teen-ager during the four days she was
missing late last year.
   ``There may not have been any crime committed here,'' he said in
an interview about the Brawley case reported Friday in New York
Newsday. ``If a crime, or crimes, were committed, then you would
surmise that there would be suspects.'' But Abrams said his
investigation had turned up no suspects.

   Police say a routine license-plate check
led to the arrest of five alleged members of a violent polygamist
sect linked to killings in Utah, Texas and other states.
   The five people in custody in Phoenix were identified this week
as children or followers of the late polygamist cult leader Ervil
LeBaron. Authorities were still seeking at least seven other
alleged members of the cult.
   Ervil's son Heber LeBaron, 27; and four people described as
Heber's siblings or half siblings were arrested July 1 on
investigation of auto theft charges after a stolen truck was found
at a Phoenix motel at which they were staying.
   Authorities at first released three of the five on bail before
realizing through fingerprint checks and other clues that the five
were linked to the cult. The three were then rearrested.
   All had given false names and dates of birth, said Sgt. Andy
Anderson, chief spokesman for the Phoenix police department.
   ``There was no evidence at the time to hold them,'' said
Anderson. ``There was no connection to the LeBaron cult until
(Wednesday).''
   Anderson said the initial arrests were triggered when a police
sergeant running license checks July 1 on vehicles in a motel
parking lot found a pickup truck reported stolen in Texas.
   Heber LeBaron and two of his half brothers who are still at
large, Aaron and Andrew LeBaron, are wanted for questioning in the
June 27 execution-style slayings in Texas of three men and an
8-year-old girl.
   Some of the cult members are also wanted for questioning in an
October 1987 killing in Utah, authorities said.
   ``Of course we're glad, but we're not totally relieved until the
others are (arrested) too,'' said Thelma Chynoweth, mother of two
of the Texas victims and grandmother of the 8-year-old girl. She is
also the grandmother of Aaron and Andrew LeBaron in the group's
complicated, poligamy-based family tree.
   The senior LeBaron, 56, died in 1981 of a heart attack at the
Utah State Prison. He had been sentenced to a life term for
masterminding the 1977 gunshot slaying of a rival polygamist.
   Although the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints now excommunicates those who advocate or practice polygamy,
authorities estimate that 20,000 to 30,000 people live a
religion-based polygamist lifestyle in Utah and neighboring states.
   Observers of the LeBaron cult have said the group believes in
``blood atonement,'' or the killing of members who have left the
group.
   The Oct. 16, 1987, slaying in Utah of Daniel Ben Jordan, 53, of
Bennett, Colo.; and the June 27 killings in Texas of Duane
Chynoweth, 31; his daughter, Jennifer, 8; his brother, Mark, 36;
and Eddie Marston, 32; brought to 18 the number of Ervil LeBaron's
former disciples, family members and critics who have died or
disappeared in the last 22 years from Utah to Mexico.
   None of those in custody has been charged in the recent
killings.The five were charged with operating an illegal enterprise
and are believed to have run an auto-theft ring in the Phoenix area
for several months, Anderson said.
   Heber LeBaron also is being held on an aggravated robbery charge
stemming from a Richardson, Texas, savings and loan robbery.
   Another suspect, identified through fingerprints as Douglas
Barlow, 28, also faces a Houston charge of burglary out of an auto,
police said.
   FBI agent John Loughney identified the other three in custoy as
Cynthia, Richard and Tarsa LeBaron, all ``either full, half or
quarter or whatever sisters or brothers'' of Heber LeBaron.
   Still being sought by a grand jury in Utah, authorities said,
were Natasha Thelma LeBaron, Patricia LeBaron, Alex Zarate, Andreas
Zarate and Linda Johnson. Also sought, according to Salt Lake
County attorney's investigator Dick Forbes, were Aaron and Andrew
LeBaron.

   Rebels mounted three attacks in
northern and central Nicaragua in violation of a truce with the
Sandinista government, the Defense Ministry said Friday.
   Its report said three of the U.S.-supported rebels, known as
Contras, and one civilian were killed in the fighting and the
Contras kidnapped 20 people.
   The ministry statement said that in one of the attacks on
Thursday, three Contras died in a shootout with an army patrol in
northern Matagalpa province.
   It also said the Contras ambushed an army truck in northern
Jinotega province, kidnapping 16 people on board, and that four
other people were abducted by the rebels and a civilian was killed
in central Chontales province.
   The statement gave no details of the fighting and said nothing
of any government casualties. The Contras and the leftist
Sandinista government have accused each other of truce violations
on and off since the cease-fire began March 21.
   Representatives from both sides held meetings to try to reach a
peace accord without success. The last round of talks in June ended
in deadlock and no new meetings were scheduled.
   The Sandinistas celebrate nine years in power next Tuesday. The
insurrection they led in July 1979 ended 42 years of rule by the
rightist, pro-American Somoza dynasty.
   The army announced on Friday a series of military exercises to
defend Managua, the capital, in case of attack. The Sandinistas
have long claimed the United States eventually plans to invade
Nicaragua.
   On Monday, the Sandinistas expelled U.S. Ambassador Richard
Melton and seven other U.S. diplomats, accusing them of conspiring
to undermine the government.
   The Interior Ministry announced Friday night the suspension of
the radio program ``El Despertar'' (The Awakening) for
``transmitting false information.'' The statement, read over
state-run radio, did not say how long the suspension would be in
effect.
   Last week the government closed down the Roman Catholic Church's
Radio Catolica; suspended publication for 15 days of the only
opposition newspaper, La Prensa, and earlier this week expropriated
Ingenio San Antonio, the country's leading sugar refinery.
   Business leaders called the takeover of the company, belonging
to the wealthy Pellas family, a setback for private enterprise.
   Washington reacted to the expulsion of U.S. diplomats by
ordering out Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann and seven
embassy colleagues.
   Tunnermann reluctantly bowed to the order and departed on
Friday, five minutes ahead of the deadline imposed by the State
Department.
   In Managua, Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto issued a statement
saying Tunnermann would remain as Nicaragua's ambassador to the
Organization of American States in Washington ``until this
controversy can be elucidated.''
   The statement reiterated Nicaragua's position that as OAS
ambassador, Tunnermann cannot be barred from Washington despite his
expulsion as ambassador to the United States.
   Nicaragua called for the InterAmerican Legal Committee to
resolve the dispute.

<HEAD>Teller Claimed X-Ray Laser Could Destroy All Land-Based Soviet
Missiles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hydrogen bomb developer Edward Teller once
told a top administration arms control adviser that a proposed
``Star Wars'' laser could ``potentially shoot down the entire
Soviet land-based missile force,'' a congressional report says.
   That and some other details in the report back the charge by a
disaffected former director of the X-ray laser research program
that Teller made unsupportable claims about the potential of the
proposed weapon, Rep. George Brown Jr. said Friday.
   ``Let me plead guilty to the great crime of optimism,'' Teller
countered Friday.
   Roy Woodruff resigned in 1985 as director of the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory's research program into the X-ray laser
because of the dispute, and said he was demoted to an entry-level
job.
   Last year, Woodruff filed grievances alleging that Teller and
another scientist, Lowell Wood, made ``overly optimistic,
technically incorrect statements regarding this research to the
nation's highest policy-makers.'' He also accused Roger Batzel,
then the lab's director, of blocking his efforts to correct those
statements.
   An internal study eventually concluded that Woodruff was made
into an ``unperson'' because of his dispute with Batzel.
   The General Accounting Office report, written at Brown's
request, cited some optimistic statements by Teller and Wood but
also concluded that Woodruff and his colleagues at Livermore shared
that optimism to some extent.
   ``The report is trying to straddle the fence,'' Brown said by
phone from Washington. ``It says that Woodruff made similar
(optimistic) statements, but that in a couple of instances _ the
two Woodruff objected to most _ the statements (by Teller and Wood)
were indeed overly optimistic and not factual.''
   Teller, interviewed by telephone from Livermore, contended the
GAO report backs his point of view. The report, he said, shows that
Woodruff's criticisms were over the way Teller worded his claims,
but that Woodruff ``supported (them) in substance.''
   The claim about the laser being able to shoot down all 10,000
Soviet land-based missiles sounds absurd because it was quoted out
of context, the physicist said.
   ``I tried to illustrate the possibly great effects that the
X-ray laser might produce,'' Teller said. ``If you read the letter,
you will find qualifiers: `eventually,' `potentially' and
`perhaps.'''
   In a telephone interview, Woodruff also contended that the GAO
report generally backs his point of view, but he had some criticism
for it.
   The report, he said Friday, ``establishes everything I ever
alleged, but I am very unhappy with the finding that suggests there
was a great deal of similarity between Dr. Teller and myself.''
   ``He was an enthusiast for the X-ray laser and I was an
enthusiast. But the points we differed on were very important,''
Woodruff said, adding, ``I am still struggling to tell the truth
against what I would call reprisals.''
   A space-based system of X-ray laser beams, powered by nuclear
detonations, is no longer viewed as the centerpiece of Reagan's
proposed Strategic Defense Initiative, known as SDI or Star Wars.
SDI research now focuses on land-based weapons to defend the United
States against Soviet nuclear missiles, Brown said.

   Outgoing Attorney General Edwin Meese III told
a group of judges and lawyers Friday that he objects to the use of
independent counsels to investigate the executive branch because
they are ``for all intents and purposes unaccountable.''
   Without elaborating, Meese said it is not inconceivable to him
that someday an independent counsel could be used by Congress to
control the presidency.
   ``Taken to its logical conclusion, the American people could be
effectively deprived of their right to vote for the chief executive
of their own choosing if these fundamental rights are taken away
piecemeal by Congress,'' said Meese. The attorney general himself
was recently the target of an investigation by an independent
counsel.
   ``The creation of such an independent office takes important
government functions away from politically accountable officials
and transfers them to ad hoc officials who practically have no
mechanism for control and who are for all intents and purposes
unaccountable,'' Meese said.
   The remarks came in a speech, focusing on the separation of
powers, to lawyers and judges attending the 8th Circuit Judicial
Conference.
   Enacted in the post-Watergate era, the 1978 Ethics In Government
Act set up a system of court-appointed special prosecutors,
subsequently renamed independent counsels, to investigate
allegations of wrongdoing by top officials in the Executive Branch.
On June 29, in a defeat for the administration, the Supreme Court
voted 7-1 to uphold the constitutionality of the 1978 law.
   In reference to that opinion, Meese said: ``How do you determine
where the line will be drawn? Since the court itself drew no
concrete lines, some may contend that it's possible that virtually
any executive function could be relegated to an independent office
so long as it does not positively disable the president from
accomplishing his constitutional role. And `positively disabling'
is in itself a somewhat subjective standard.''
   Meese said the president needs to ``stand up to Congress'' as it
attempts to acquire more power over the White House.
   Meese has said he will leave his post with the Reagan
administration by next month. He made the announcement after saying
he was vindicated when independent counsel James McKay filed a
report with a federal appeals court signifying he had decided not
to seek criminal charges against the attorney general.
   McKay spent 14 months looking into Meese's involvement with,
among other things, the bankrupt military contractor Wedtech Corp.
and a $1 billion Iraqi oil-pipeline project.
   McKay has referred his report to the Justice Department, where
the Office of Professional Responsibility could consider whether
Meese had done anything unethical.
   Meese had refrained from commenting on the independent counsel
process while he was under investigation by McKay. Meese removed
himself from participation in the Justice Department's filing of a
court brief raising objections to the independent counsel statute.
   Meese said if the trend continued, it would not be ``stretching
the imagination'' to envision the appointment of an independent
``arms procurement czar'' at the Pentagon or an independent Navy
controller as a response to the July 3 downing of the Iranian
civilian airliner.
   In a brief news conference after his speech, Meese said he
approved of President Reagan's choice of former Pennsylvania Gov.
Richard L. Thornburgh as his successor.
   ``I think he's an excellent choice,'' Meese said. ``He's a man
I've known for a long time, he's a good friend and I think he and I
think alike on almost every aspect of law enforcement.''

   Massive thunderstorms packing tornadoes and
wind gusts up to 92 mph slammed into Omaha and Council Bluffs,
Iowa, on Friday, injuring at least 40 people and damaging more than
100 homes.
   One tornado uprooted trees, downed power lines, started fires
and overturned railroad cars in a 2-mile stretch in western Council
Bluffs along Interstate 29 and the Missouri River, which divides
the two cities.
   Most of Council Bluffs' 60,000 residents were without power
Friday night and the situation was not expected to change through
morning, said Matt Daunis of Iowa Power and Light Co.
   Council Bluffs Mayor Tom Hanafan ordered a curfew from 10 p.m.
to dawn to guard against looting. Members of the Iowa National
Guard patroled the streets.
   An Omaha man was reported in critical condition with neck and
possible internal injuries after a tree crashed onto the roof of
his car. Most other injuries were minor, said officials of three
hospitals who counted a total of 40 people treated for
storm-related injuries.
   Exits off Interstate 29 into Council Bluffs were closed and the
Iowa Highway Patrol sealed off the area most heavily damaged.
   Possible tornadoes and funnel clouds were reported throughout
the Omaha area as hail fell and more than 2 inches of rain caused
street flooding.
   ``We went to the hallway and we were praying very hard,'' said
Council Bluffs resident Lu Guzenhauser, who was baby-sitting for
two children when the storm hit her neighborhood.
   Ms. Guzenhauser and the children were not injured. However, part
of the tool shed behind her house was hanging from power lines in
the front of her home after the storm.
   Trees as thick as 48 inches in diameter snapped in half in
Council Bluffs and others as tall as 100-feet were uprooted at
Dodge Park Golf Course in Omaha.
   In the worst 2-mile stretch in Council Bluffs, the tops of
hundreds of trees were sawed off by the twister, sidewalks were
uplifted and roofs were blown off houses.
   A wind gust of 92 mph was reported at Omaha's Eppley Airfield at
4:21 p.m., the National Weather Service reported.

<HEAD>Iranians Withdraw from Territory in Northern Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONA ZIADE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi forces chased Iranian troops out of
one of two strategic positions they still held in north Iraq on
Thursday, another victory in a drive to regain all territory seized
by Iran during the 8-year war.
   Iran admitted its troops withdrew from the mountain town of Hajj
Omran in the Sulaimaniya region of Kurdistan.
   Iran's powerful Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of Parliament
and acting commander in chief of the armed forces, declared that
after the recent military setbacks, his country should prepare for
a long-term war.
   Iraq and Iran have been at war since September 1980.
   Thursday's retreat was the third by the Iranians in that area in
three days. It came as Iraqi troops launched widespread mopup
operations in the south, tightening their grip on areas recently
evacuated by the Iranians.
   State-run Baghdad Radio, monitored in Nicosia, broke into
regular programming to announce the fall of Hajj Omran after a
fierce battle between Iraq's 5th Army Corps and Iran's
Revolutionary Guards.
   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored
in Nicosia, said Iranian combatants in Hajj Omran withdrew to ``new
defensive positions ... The evacuation ... is for a more
appropriate deployment of combat forces in other defensive lines.''
   Hajj Omran, Penjwin and Halabja are all in the Sulaimaniya
region, which is inhabited by Iranian-backed, autonomy-seeking
Kurdish rebels.
   Iran captured the region in an offensive last March. It claimed
at the time that 5,000 Kurds were killed and 7,000 injured in
Halabja when the Iraqis pounded the town with chemical weapons
despite a world ban on such weapons.
   The Iranians admitted withdrawing from Halabja on Tuesday and
the Iraqis said on Wednesday that they regained the Penjwin basin.
Iran said only that its forces are regrouping in Penjwin.
   That left the Iranians entrenched only in the town of Penjwin,
encircled by Iraqis on all the surrounding mountain peaks.
   In the south, Iraqi troops continued to consolidate positions in
areas they retook from the Iranians in four consecutive thrusts
since April, the Iraqi News Agency reported, monitored in Nicosia.
   The Iraqis captured the Zubaidat region in a four-hour battle
Tuesday and chased the fleeing troops on Wednesday all the way to
Dehloran, an Iranian city about 30 miles east of the border. They
were still in Dehloran on Thursday.
   Iraq took the initiative in the war in April, dislodging the
Iranians from the Faw peninsula in that month, and from the
Shalmcheh and oil-rich Majnoon islands in May and June.
   The Iranians now control a few scattered pockets in the central
sector of the 730-mile warfront.
   Ali Reza Moayeri, Iran's deputy prime minister for foreign
affairs, told Tehran radio on Thursday: ``At present the enemy is
fully mobilized against us. we should go to war more strongly.''
   In Manama, Bahrain, U.S. officials said the U.S. Navy was
escorting a Kuwaiti vessel in the Persian Gulf Thursday in the 47th
convoy of 1988.
   The 46,723-ton liquefied gas carrier Gas Prince left Kuwait
Wednesday, the U.S. Central Command announced in Tampa, Fla.
   The ship was among the first of 11 Kuwait-owned tankers
re-registered under the U.S. flag last July, entitling them to Navy
protection from Iranian attack.
   Soviet and Iraqi officials said in Moscow Thursday that the
visit there by Iraq's envoy Saadoun Hammadi failed to overcome
Soviet opposition to an international arms embargo against Iran.
   ``We don't have any radical changes in our position,'' Soviet
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfilyev told a government
news briefing.
   Hammadi, president of Iraq's National Council and a member of
its Revolutionary Command Council, told reporters earlier that
differences in views between his country and the Kremlin remained.
   In Ankara, Turkey, Foreign Ministry spokesman Nazim Berker said
two Turkish soldiers were killed by gunfire from Iran while
patrolling the border Wednesday. He said Thursday the attack took
place near Gelenler village in eastern Van province of Van, that
Turkey asked Iran to arrest the killers and that Turkey may ask
compensation in the deaths.

   A federal judge temporarily blocked the
release of court documents in the massive probe of fraud in the
defense industry Friday, saying he will decide in a week whether to
overturn a magistrate's ruling that the media and the public have a
right to see the documents.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon ordered attorneys for the news
media, the government and other interested parties to submit papers
and be prepared to present arguments July 22 at 2 p.m. PDT.
   Federal judges in three other jurisdictions _ Minneapolis,
Brooklyn, N.Y., and Alexandria, Va. _ rejected other efforts Friday
to unseal affidavits concerning the probe.
   The massive investigation, which became public last month,
centers on allegations that defense industry consultants bribed
Pentagon officials for information that helped contractors win
multimillion-dollar contracts.
   Kenyon's decision blocked action on a ruling hours before by
U.S. Magistrate Joseph Reichmann ordering release of sealed
affidavits filed with warrants to search the offices of three
Southern California defense contractors and one defense consultant.
   Reichmann's ruling on a request by attorneys for the Los Angeles
Times, Copley Newspapers and the National Broadcasting Corp. was
immediately appealed by the government, bringing the case to Kenyon.
   Kenyon said his office had been inundated with calls, many of
them from people who claimed an interest in keeping the documents
secret, and he said he wanted them to give them a chance to be
heard.
   An attorney for one of those individuals appeared in the
courtroom but refused to identify the person he represented. The
lawyer, Gordon O'Connell, said he would tell the judge in a sealed
document the identity of his client, but wouldn't tell anyone else.
   He said the person is an employee of one of the companies whose
plants were searched.
   An attorney for the Los Angeles Times said it was likely the
issue wouldn't be resolved until it reaches the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals. He urged Kenyon to move more swiftly so appeals
could go forward, but the judge said he felt a week was a
reasonable continuance.
   The government made one concession when it proposed releasing
innocuous ``boilerplate'' sections of each search warrant such as
its title and description of the FBI agents who executed the
warrant and of the premises searched. But O'Connell objected, and
Kenyon said he would review the ``boilerplate'' sections privately
and rule Monday if they can be released.
   In his earlier ruling, Reichmann was adamant about the public's
right to know.
   ``Corruption, bribery, these are things that go to the heart of
how our government functions,'' Reichmann said.
   ``We are talking about the foundations of our country, the
defense of our country,'' Reichmann said in ruling that the public
has the right to know through the news media about matters of such
national importance.
   Defense consultant Fred Lackner's attorney, William Dougherty,
said he wanted the affidavit released so he could represent his
client properly.
   The warrants sought in Los Angeles were used June 13 to search
the offices of Northrop Corp., Teledyne Inc., Litton Industries and
Lackner's home. They were among 33 search warrants executed across
the country that day.
   Affidavits attached to the warrants contain statements from
investigators disclosing evidence they uncovered through
court-ordered eavesdropping and detailing what they are seeking
through their searches.
   In Minneapolis, U.S. Magistrate J. Earl Cudd refused the Star
Tribune's request to unseal documents related to the search of
Unisys Corp.'s offices in Eagan, Minn. But Cudd ordered prosecutors
to explain in writing why they wanted the documents kept secret,
and set another hearing for Friday.
   In Brooklyn, U.S. District Judge Edward Korman ordered the
unsealing of four search warrants, but kept the affidavits secret.
He postponed opening the warrants until Wednesday to give the
government time to appeal.
   Korman's ruling was made on a motion filed by Newsday, the
newspaper headquartered on Long Island.
   The search warrants that Korman said could be made public
include those used at the Long Island home of Charles F. Gardner, a
defense consultant who is a former vice president for the Unisys
Corp.; the office of Dennis Mitchell, a Unisys employee at its
Great Neck, N.Y., plant; the offices of the Hazeltine Corp. in
Greenlawn, N.Y.; and the Kane Paper Corp. in Baldwin, N.Y., which
supplies paper products to aerospace companies.
   In Alexandria, Va., two federal judges refused to unseal
affidavits used to search the office and home of former Navy
official Melvyn Paisley, and the premises of Thomas Muldoon of
Washington, D.C. Both men are defense consultants. Attorneys for
Paisley and Muldoon had sought access to the documents but were not
seeking full public release.
   In a related development Friday, St. Louis-based McDonnell
Douglas Corp. said its consulting contract with Paisley has been
terminated early ``by mutual agreement.''
   ``It was decided under the present circumstances that Mr.
Paisley did not have the time to devote to his contract,'' said
McDonnell Douglas spokesman Mike Burch. He said Paisley had been a
consultant to the company since shortly after leaving the Pentagon
in 1987 and had assisted ``with a wide range of our product lines,
both military and commercial.''
   Burch said he didn't know when Paisley's contract was due to
expire. He refused to disclose how much McDonnell Douglas has paid
Paisley.
   After resigning his post as the Navy's assistant secretary for
research, engineering and systems, Paisley became a consultant to
several contractors, including McDonnell Douglas, Martin Marietta,
Pratt & Whitney and LTV.
   A search warrant made public last week said the FBI suspected
that Paisley accepted bribes or gratuities from McDonnell Douglas
and two other contractors while he was serving at the Pentagon.
   Paisley has also lost Unisys Corp. as a client as the
corporation ended all contracts with defense consultants ``for the
time being,'' Unisys told The Washington Post for a story in
Saturday's editions.
   Unisys spokesman Bill Beckham said the consultants whose
contracts were terminated included Paisley and William Galvin, an
associate of Paisley who also is under investigation in the defense
probe.
   In Los Angeles, U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner told Reichmann that
disclosure of the detailed information in the affidavits would
alert targets of the investigation and might encourage them to
destroy documents.
   But Reichmann sided with attorney Rex Heincke, representing the
Times, who said the wide publicity of the defense fraud probe makes
the sealing unnecessary because the investigation is no longer
secret.
   Reichmann said few Americans read newspapers or care about the
outcome of the defense probe, ``But this is about those few people
who care and who keep this country on its toes.''
   Citizens are entitled to ask, ``are we just throwing our money
away when we buy these defense programs?'' he said.
   Bonner also contended that the First Amendment right of access
applies only after a defendant has been arrested or indicted. No
one has been charged in the defense procurement investigation.
   The only affidavit released in the case was unsealed earlier
this month in Dallas. But some of the less-detailed search warrants
have been released.

   An explosion and fire at a Mobil Oil
refinery killed one man and injured two Friday just hours after a
flash fire in another part of the plant injured five other people,
officials said.
   The two fires were not believed to be related, and both involved
employees from private companies contracted by Mobil Oil, said Fire
Chief Denny Haas.
   ``They were different companies, with different processes in
different parts of the plant,'' said Haas.
   Shortly before 10 a.m., a flash fire injured five men from an
outside contractor who were working on the refinery's sewage
system, said Haas. Investigators believed sparks from a welder's
torch ignited fumes rising from water that was mixed with volatile
liquids, he said.
   The second fire erupted about 3:20 p.m. and was quickly
extinguished, but the blast left thousands of gallons of toxic
hydrogen peroxide and other chemicals mixed with oil on the ground,
said Haas.
   The dead man and the two men injured in the second fire are all
employees of Benecia-based Calcat Chemical Co. They were removing
the residue from pipes containing a number of chemicals when the
pipes exploded, said Haas. The reason for the blast was not
immediately determined, he said.
   Of the seven workers injured in the two fires, four were
hospitalized, one in critical condition. The dead man was
identified as Winston Alexander Jones, 30, no hometown available,
Haas said.
   After the second fire, firefighters sprayed foam on the ground
to control the spread of the spilt hydrogen peroxide, arsenic, oil,
and other materials, but no evacuations were ordered, said Haas.
   In November, a huge blast at the refinery shattered windows
throughout the area 15 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, sending
a huge fireball into the air and sparking a blaze that burned for
two days. One refinery worker suffered minor injuries.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega said Thursday
that any U.S. decision to resume military aid to Nicaraguan rebels
would amount to ``newly legitimizing'' a war in which a truce was
declared months ago.
   A source close to the rebels, known as Contras, said in the
Dominican Republic that the leadership would meet this weekend in
that nation's capital, Santo Domingo, to reorganize the movement.
   Leading foes of the leftist Sandinista government meanwhile
vowed that their fight against the government's latest crackdown
had just begun.
   Ortega spoke to journalists in Campoa, 58 miles northeast of
Managua, where he inaugurated an agricultural fair.
   ``We hope they (the United States) do not commit this madness,
since it would be newly legitimizing'' the civil war that began
seven years ago, he said in remarks broadcast on the state radio,
Voice of Nicaragua.
   The U.S. House of Representatives voted 385-18 on Thursday to
condemn Ortega's government for ``brutal suppression of basic human
rights.''
   A similar resolution passed by the Senate by a 91-4 vote
Wednesday night included the possibility of renewed military aid to
the Contras if Sandinista policy did not change. The resolution
would make democratic reform a condition of economic aid to
Nicaragua.
   In their resolution, House members urged Central American
leaders ``to convene immediately to assess the conditions in
Nicaragua described in this resolution.''
   They condemned the Sandinistas for arresting 43 demonstrators,
including opposition leaders, and closing the opposition newspaper
La Prensa and the Roman Catholic Church radio station this week.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco told The Associated
Press the U.S. Senate resolution was ``tremendously interventionist
and illegal.'' ``We call this imperialism,'' Tinoco said.
   Patricia Orozco of the Interior Ministry's press office said 31
anti-government demonstrators arrested Sunday were sentenced by
police courts to six-month jail sentences for violating public
security laws.
   Five demonstrators were sentenced similarly on Wednesday.
   Security forces violently broke up the demonstration Sunday in
Nandaime, south of Managua.
   The source in Santo Domingo said more than 50 prominent Contras
were expected to attend the weekend meeting, including Adolfo
Calero, political head of the organization, and military
coordinator Enrique Bermudez.
   Internal disputes, notably between Bermudez and the movement's
political leaders, have divided the rebels in recent weeks. The
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said new leadership
was expected to be chosen.
   ``This is a very hard dictatorship,'' Enrique Bolanos, a critic
of the government, said in an interview. He is president of the
Superior Private Enterprise Council, an opposition group.
   ``They cannot stand the tremendous opposition that is gaining
momentum,'' Bolanos said. ``Everybody now knows they are
Marxist-Leninists.''
   On Monday, the Sandinistas ordered U.S. Ambassador Richard
Melton and seven other American diplomats to leave the country.
Melton left Tuesday and the others followed on Thursday.
   The Reagan administration ordered the same number of Nicaraguan
diplomats out of the United States.
   Ortega's government expropriated Nicaragua's largest and oldest
sugar refinery on Wednesday, claiming it was not productive enough
and the owners, the wealthy Pellas family, were not investing
enough to keep it going.
   The century-old refinery is a leading symbol of Nicaraguan
private enterprise.
   Carlos Pellas, the refinery's general manager, told reporters
Thursday the expropriation was ``a very hard blow for the economy.''
   He said the related Flor de Cana rum distillery, known
throughout Latin America, was legally separate from the refinery
and not affected by the expropriation.
   The crackdown reverses an easing of restrictions on the
opposition that began in November as part of a Central American
peace plan approved in August 1987 by the presidents of Nicaragua,
El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica.
   Under the plan, the Sandinistas and rebels reached a cease-fire
agreement March 21 that has survived occasional violations.
Negotiations on a permanent truce are deadlocked.

<HEAD>`Much Ado About Nothing' Starring Kevin Kline Opens in Central
Park</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   ``A merry war'' is the way one character
describes the relationship between Benedick and Beatrice, those
tempest-tossed, tart-tongued lovers in ``Much Ado About Nothing.''
   That's pretty much the way it's played in Central Park where the
New York Shakespeare Festival opened its boisterous revival of one
of Shakespeare's most durable comedies on Thursday night.
   Director Gerald Freedman opts for the robust rather than the
romantic in his staging of the play, an approach that accentuates
the laughs rather than the poetry.
   Fortunately, he gets both from Kevin Kline, who probably could
walk on water if asked to do so by his director.
   Kline does just about everything else in ``Much Ado,'' and he
accomplishes it with such style, wit and grace that he gives
hamminess a good name. The actor makes a first-rate arrogant,
foolish and finally lovestruck Benedick.
   Consider Kline's entrance in the play. It's no quiet walk-on.
It's a full-fledged sword fight, staged with an alarming
athleticism by fight director B.H. Barry. In the middle of this
ruckus, Beatrice sits quietly and reads a book. The battle lines
are drawn as soon as the play begins.
   If Blythe Danner, who appears as the equally obstinate and
egocentric Beatrice, can't match the Kline juggernaut, she gives it
a good try. Her Beatrice is too much of a lady, and her odd, almost
squeaky voice is not particularly suited for Shakespeare. Still,
she exudes an impertinence that mangages to charm Benedick and the
audience by the end of the evening.
   A special joy of Freedman's production is the strong supporting
cast which usually fades into the background. Brian Murray makes a
comical yet touching Don Pedro, the nobleman who instigates the
matching up of Benedick with Beatrice and Claudio with Hero.
   Don John, the melancholy villain of the play, is a strange
character. He sets in motion a subplot to besmirch Hero's honor and
then disappears. David Pierce does a fine comic turn _ all smirks
and sneers _ and remains in one's memory even after he leaves the
stage.
   There is more good support from Robert Gerringer as Leonato,
Beatrice's uncle, another of those underrated roles, and from Jerry
Stiller as the dumbest of Dogberrys. Because Beatrice and Benedick
are so strong, the actors playing the other set of lovers tend to
disappear into the plot. That's the case with Don Reilly, a
colorless Claudio, and Phoebe Cates, a one-dimensional Hero.
   Designer John Ezell has provided a fairy tale 19th century
Italian town, which is where Freedman sets the play. The costumes
by Theoni V. Aldredge are colorful and apppropriate to the period.
   There is an inevitable falloff after the exuberant first act.
But that's because the ending has been telegraphed long before the
play is over and the involved plot convolutions must be
straightened out before the curtain falls.
   Still this ``Much Ado About Nothing'' spins gaily for much of
the evening and most of it turns because of the whirlwind
performance of Kevin Kline. He makes it the airiest, most bouyant
production in New York.

<HEAD>Tiny Cracks Found In Nearly Half Of Inspected Boeing 737s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tiny cracks were found in nearly half the aging
Boeing 737 jetliners known to have been inspected since the top
ripped off an Aloha Airlines 737 in late May, a Federal Aviation
Administration official testified Thursday.
   James W. Hart Jr., manager of the airframe branch in the FAA's
Seattle aircraft certification office, described the initial
responses to an FAA ``airworthiness directive'' in testimony to a
National Transportation Safety Board hearing on the accident.
   The order, issued within a week after the April 28 accident,
required all Boeing 737s with 30,000 or more landings to undergo a
special visual inspection of fuselage lap joints, or areas where
parts of the fuselage are bonded and riveted together.
   The directive ordered those with more than 50,000 landings to
have additional inspections using high-frequency electronic
equipment. Airlines were required to fix any problems found and to
report the results to the FAA.
   A flight attendant was killed and 61 persons injured when a
portion of the fuselage on a Boeing 737 peeled off during an Aloha
flight from Hilo to Honolulu, exposing the first-class section to
the open air at 24,000 feet.
   The pilot and co-pilot managed to land the crippled jet 13
minutes later in Maui although one of the two engines quit.
   Hart said 291 737s were affected by the inspection order issued
shortly after the accident. As of this week, he said, the FAA has
received reports on 100 planes, of which 49 reported cracks.
   The largest crack found was about one-half inch, but most were
three-eighths of an inch or smaller, he said. The most found in one
plane were 31 cracks within a 40-inch space. Five or more cracks
were found in 14 of the planes, he said.
   Cracks can occur around the rivets used to join the panels. Hart
said none of the cracks reported had joined up _ ``In other words,
they had not gone from fastener to fastener.''
   Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble declined comment on the cracks
until he had spoken with the airlplane manufacturer's engineers.
   Bill Ashworth, manager of the FAA's Seattle aircraft
certification division, said he was concerned about the cracks but
saw no imminent danger to the planes or to air passengers.
   As of today ``we have not seen evidence of impending failure in
any airplane. We of course are requiring that all cracks we finds
be repaired. That's only prudent maintenance,'' he said.
   In testimony earlier Thursday, Boeing's Robert L. Oldani said he
was shocked to learn in an October 1987 meeting with Aloha
officials that the airline did not have a specific program to
prevent corrosion of its air fleet.
   Oldani told the NTSB that Henry Arii, Aloha's staff vice
president of quality control and engineering, told him that Aloha
had stopped its corrosion control program three years earlier.
   Much of the testimony at the hearing has focused on technical
studies of how cracks form in 737s. The inquiry is trying to
determine the cause of the Aloha accident, but early investigations
have focused on possible structural failure, perhaps aggravated by
corrosion.
   Hart told the panel that the FAA was formulating ``very
demanding'' new rules to require extensive inspections of early
737s.

   Insurance problems will delay a plan aimed
at reducing the spread of AIDS by distributing free needles to
intravenous drug users, a social service agency official said
Thursday.
   Kathy Oliver, executive director of the agency Outside In, said
her organization hopes to begin giving out the hypodermic needles
by late August.
   Oliver said the insurance company, St. Paul Fire and Marine of
St. Paul, Minn., is concerned about the agency's liability because
the project, which was scheduled to begin this month, is
unprecedented in the United States.
   ``It is difficult to assess the exposure and risk, and therefore
it's difficult to determine rates,'' she said.
   Beth Murray, spokeswoman for St. Paul Fire and Marine, said the
company notified Outside In that the project wasn't covered under
its existing policy.
   ``It takes us into areas of unknown liability,'' she said.
``We're especially concerned for the potential of the spread of
AIDS from needles supplied by the clinic and later re-used.''
   Under the yearlong project, 125 drug abusers will exchange used
needles for new ones and receive counseling.
   The project is financed by a $67,000 grant from the American
Foundation for AIDS Research. If the insurance cost increases
greatly, Oliver said, she is confident that more funds can be
obtained because of the interest in the experiment nationwide.
   St. Paul, the largest medical liability insurer in the country,
has provided comprehensive medical malpractice and liability
insurance to Outside In for 10 years. The agency never has had a
claim filed against its policy.
   ``We're negotiating with them to work this out,'' Murray said.
``They've been insured with our company for several years and it's
important for us to work it out with them.''
   Oliver said the company's action came as a surprise because the
problems didn't surface when agency officials spoke with the
insurance company about the proposed project a year ago and again
when the financing was obtained earlier this year.
   She said the company apparently became concerned after news
accounts of the project were published. Outside In learned about
the problem about two weeks ago, she said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is most often spread through
sexual contact, sharing of needles by intravenous drug abusers, or
by transfusions of blood or blood products, experts say.

   The construction crews are still at work, but the

nomination next week is complete enough for party officials to
begin to breathe easier.
   Easy enough, anyway, to feel assured the whole thing will be in
place by Monday's opening gavel and easy enough to bring the
construction workers into the delegates' chairs Thursday for a
little ceremonial ribbon-cutting.
   ``When you're at home watching this convention, having a Bud or

   The number of Americans who believe in the
divinity of Jesus Christ has increased in the last decade, but a
smaller percentage belong to organized churches, according to a new
Gallup Poll.
   ``The churches of America have made no headway in narrowing the
gap between religious belief and church involvement, between
believers and belongers,'' said the polling organization's
co-chairman, George Gallup, in previewing the survey results
Thursday.
   The nationwide survey of 2,556 adults, called ``The Unchurched
American,'' found that 84 percent of those surveyed believe Christ
is either God or the son of God, compared with 78 percent in a
similar 1978 Gallup Poll. The number of survey respondents
declaring they were ``committed to Jesus Christ'' increased from 60
percent to 66 percent.
   Forty-four percent of respondents were classified as
``unchurched'' because they have not attended regular services in
six months, compared with 40 percent of those polled a decade ago.

   President Reagan has given conflicting
indications on whether he will veto a Pentagon budget bill that
deeply cuts his request for Star Wars spending and restricts his
arms control policies, lawmakers say.
   ``I don't think we have a clear signal,'' Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan., said. ``I'm not certain the president will sign
this bill.''
   Dole spoke shortly before the Senate voted 64-30 for the
measure, hours after the House approved it, 229-183. Both
Democratic-controlled chambers split along party lines as they sent
the bill to Reagan's desk.
   Dole and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, told their colleagues that Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci had indicated Reagan was likely to sign the bill.
   But Sen. Daniel Quayle, R-Ind., who made an unsuccessful attempt
to strip the provisions Reagan disliked, said the administration
opposed the measure.

   Many parents incorrectly assume it's safe to
leave babies older than 9 months alone in the bathtub, says a study
that found old people and children face a similar risk of drowning
in tubs and swimming pools.
   Doctors should remind parents ``that the bathtub is still a
potentially lethal place and that the child should not be left
alone even for brief periods,'' the researchers wrote in today's
issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``We're recommending parents just let the phone or doorbell
ring, or wrap the child in a towel and take them with them,'' said
study co-author Dr. Ellen Alkon, a pediatrician at the Los Angeles

nurses said after he died while performing surgery.
   His son, Robert X. Williams III, a third-year medical student,

Wednesday at Bullock County Hospital.
   ``He never turned patients down _ no matter what their financial
status,'' Williams said, recalling times when his father received

   Wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent
in June, the government said Friday, but analysts saw cause for
worry in the steep, drought-induced climb in raw food prices.
   The Labor Department said the hot, dry weather searing much of
the nation sent prices of unprocessed grain and poultry soaring by
more than 20 percent last month, pushing raw food prices 4.2
percent higher than in May. It was the biggest jump since October
1985.
   Food prices rose a lower, but still substantial, 1.1 percent at
the wholesale level, one step before retail stores. Economists said
that it was only a matter of time before price bulges at earlier
production stages show up on supermarket shelves.

   The United States recorded a $10.9 billion
trade deficit in May, the second smallest imbalance in almost three
years, the government said Friday in a report that sent the dollar
soaring on foreign currency markets.
   The Reagan administration and private economists were in
agreement that the Commerce Department report offered conclusive
proof that the government's efforts to deal with one of the
country's biggest economic problems, a seemingly intractable trade
imbalance, were beginning to show results.
   The May deficit was actually $627 million higher than a revised
April imbalance of $10.3 billion. But the April figure was the
smallest imbalance since a $9.9 billion deficit in August 1985 and
the May deficit was the second smallest imbalance since that time.

   Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann
reluctantly yielded Friday to a Reagan administration demand that
he leave the country, departing five minutes ahead of the deadline
imposed by the State Department.
   But he took a parting shot at the administration, insisting that
the U.S. action threatened the independence of the Organization of
American States and saying his leftist government would seek
recourse through OAS legal channels.
   Speaking at a crowded embassy news conference shortly before
leaving for the airport, Tunnermann said defiance of the expulsion
order could give the Reagan administration an excuse ``to continue
its aggression against our people.''

   Speedboats attacked a tanker that passed
within five miles of the Iran's Farsi Island military stronghold
Friday, but the ship escaped with minor damage as an American
missile frigate raced to its aid.
   ``No assistance was required'' when the Robert G. Bradley
reached the 85,989-ton Sea Victory in international waters, a U.S.
Navy spokesman said.
   ``She went within five miles of Farsi and they came out to get
her,'' he said. ``She turned tail and ran straight out. They went

   Speakers criticized the United States for
shooting down an Iranian airliner, but did not condemn it, and
called in Security Council debate Friday for an end to the
Iran-Iraq war.
   Britain defended the United States. The Soviet Union and China
said the Americans were responsible, and the Soviets said the U.S.
Navy must withdraw from the Persian Gulf at once in favor of an
international peacekeeping force under U.N. sponsorship.
   Friday was the second day of a meeting Iran requested in hopes
the 15-nation council would condemn the United States for shooting
down down the Iran Air Airbus and demand its withdrawal from the

   The Teamsters turned Friday to one of its
``old guard'' leaders, William J. McCarthy, to head the besieged
union, narrowly rejecting the image-conscious heir designate of the
late Jackie Presser.
   The union's 17-member General Executive Board elected McCarthy,
69, of Boston, by a one-vote margin over Secretary-Treasurer Weldon
Mathis to fill out the last three years of Presser's term as the
Teamsters' president.
   Presser, who died a week ago, had appointed Mathis, 62, of
Atlanta, in May as acting president of the 1.6-million-member
union. The appointment was to last for 120 days, and was made just
before Presser underwent brain surgery for cancer.

   Despite an estimated 60,700 deaths in the
workplace each year, the federal government is failing to
aggressively prosecute companies that violate safety laws and
endanger workers, a study concludes.
   The Justice Department places such low priority on filing
criminal charges that it has managed just two successful
prosecutions of safety violators since 1980, said a report on the
study by The National Safe Workplace Institute.
   During the same period, California successfully prosecuted 112
cases under state operation of the federally funded program, the
institute found. California has since dropped its program, and
supporters are seeking its reinstatement.

from Azerbaijan, a resident and the state-run media reported Friday.
   One resident, a journalist with the state broadcasting
authority, claimed Azerbaijani authorities were preventing food

   ``We are under a virtual economic blockade,'' said the
journalist. ``The Azerbaijanis are trying to morally kill our

   Afghan rebels fired more than 20 rockets into
residential areas of Kabul on Friday, killing 20 people, wounding
34 and damaging a mosque and other buildings in the Afghanistan
capital, the Tass news agency reported.
   The 5:30 a.m. attack, which Tass denounced as ``barbarous'' and
a ``crime,'' was the latest reported on a major population center
in Afghanistan. Fighting has spread throughout the rugged and
mountainous country as the Soviets withdraw their troops.
   Radio Kabul also reported the attack on residential areas of the
Afghan capital. The dispatch was monitored in Islamabad, Pakistan.

<HEAD>Cemetery Yields Skeletons From Argentina's `Dirty War'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDALL HACKLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AVELLANEDA, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eleven of the skeletons each had a
bullet hole in the skull, some with mouths agape as if in a shriek.
A few still had on shreds of the clothing they wore in their last
living moment.
   In a walled-off, tennis-court-sized section of Avellaneda
Municipal Cemetery is a burial ground that authorities believe
contains the remains of 200 to 300 victims of Argentina's ``dirty
war'' of the 1970s, when a military dictatorship ruled Argentina.
   The mass gravesite in this industrial city of 650,000 southeast
of Buenos Aires is the largest so far found of those believed slain
by 1970s security forces hunting down ``subversives.''
   Each weekday, six young forensic anthropologists unearth more
bones in an attempt to document what happened to those victims, 95
percent of whom bear evidence of having been shot in the head from
short-range at the peak of the repression in 1976-78.
   ``Most of the victims are of our own generation,'' said the
team's leader, 30-year-old Morris Tidball Binz. ``We even found the
remains of one woman who was 76. It's hard to figure out who she
was a threat to.''
   The four men and two women of the Argentine Forensic
Anthropology Team have uncovered 83 victims in the four years
they've been working together. Through identifications of 20 of
those victims, three military officers have been convicted of
homicide or kidnapping.
   A government panel created by President Raul Alfonsin identified
8,961 people who died during those years, although human rights
groups say the number who were abducted, vanished and now are
presumed dead is about 20,000.
   Building legal cases against the killers is one of the goals of
the team. Another is documenting what happened in those bloody
years when scores of suspected leftists _ data shows half were
laborers or students _ ``disappeared,'' most at night, and most
from their own homes.
   Most were taken by security men to one of the 340 detention
centers for questioning; many were tortured, often fatally.
Evidence indicates some were dumped from airplanes into the River
Plate estuary. Others were tossed in unmarked graves that came to
be called ``NN,'' or no-name graves.
   ``It's not pretty,'' said Luis Fondebrider, at 24 the youngest
member of the team. ``We're trying to piece together what happened
for history's sake so that hopefully it will never occur again.''
   The team has no government funding, a surprise considering that
Alfonsin, a civilian who took over the presidency after the
military stepped down, is a human rights activist who ordered
trials that convicted five military junta leaders, including two
ex-presidents.
   The team receives $48,000 in funding from the New York-based
Ford Foundation, the Mitterrand Foundation of France and the U.S.
World Council of Churches. Its members take public transportation
to work and share office space with a human rights group in an old
three-story building near downtown Buenos Aires.
   The team began in 1984 when Tidball Binz, then a medical
student, was recruited by the renowned forensic anthropologist
Clyde Snow of Norman, Okla., to help the newly restored democracy
identify the remains of some dirty-war victims.
   Five of Tidball Binz's companions joined the team.
   Its work involves meticulously excavating a skeleton, measuring
bones, making X-rays, examining dental records and comparing every
bit to information from the medical charts of the missing. Their
findings are entered into a computer.
   Finding one that matches dental records often horrifies the
victim's relatives.
   ``It is still very, very traumatic for the families of the
victims. Some even continue denying it (the body) is who it is
despite the proof,'' Tidball Binz said.
   What's found in the graves, which Snow calls ``a time capsule
that preserves proof of the identity and cause of death,'' have
proven damning to those who contended the victims died in gunfights
with security forces.
   In nearly every case uncovered by the team, evidence showed they
had been slain with a shot to the base of the skull from about
three feet away.
   In many cases, fragments of bullets from standard police-issue
shotguns were found in the skull, Tidball Binz said. A few cases
showed victims were pregnant or recently gave birth. Some burial
plots contained groupings of chopped-off hands.

<HEAD>New Production of ``Ring'' Cycle Highlights Beyreuth Festival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN FISCHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAYREUTH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mix an experimental director from
communist East Germany with Richard Wagner's legendary operas, and
you come up with one of the most eagerly awaited Bayreuth seasons
in years.
   A new production of Wagner's epic ``Ring'' cycle under East
German director Harry Kupfer and celebrated Israeli conductor
Daniel Barenboim, will be the centerpiece of Bayreuth's Richard
Wagner Festival, which opens on July 26.
   ``From Kupfer one can expect a modern, perhaps even socially
critical production,'' critic Gerhard Koch of the Frankfurter
Allegemeine Zeitung newspaper said in an interview.
   ``The story of the family tragedy and its elements of greed,
particularly in `Die Walkuere,' lends itself well to a socially
critical interpretation.''
   The new ``Ring'' production is clearly the highlight of the
season.
   Previous festival ``Ring'' productions have set the old Germanic
myths in various time periods, and in styles ranging from bombastic
to relatively spare and modern.
   The festival, first held in 1876, transforms the placid northern
Bavarian town of Bayreuth for one month every summer into a
gathering place for Wagner lovers across the world.
   For nearly 40 years, Wolfgang Wagner, the composer's grandson,
has been running the festival, occasionally also producing festival
performances.
   Performances regularly sell out way ahead of time, as there are
only 1,925 seats available in the theater Wagner built specifically
for his works.
   The theater was financed by Bavaria's King Ludwig II, nicknamed
``Mad King Ludwig'' because of his extreme shyness and love of
overspending on elaborate, Disneyland-like castles.
   According to Mathias Vogt, a spokesman for the festival, this
year was no exception to the festival's sell-out tradition.
   ``Demand for the festival was greater this year than ever,'' he
said. ``Tickets sold out shortly after going on sale last
November.''
   The festival will open with the return of last year's
``Parsifal,'' directed by Goetz Friedrich and conducted by James
Levine.
   ``My favorite opera is `Parsifal' and that's why I'm really
looking forward to going,'' said Wagner fan Manfred Schuldt, 34, of
Hamburg. Schuldt has been making the annual trek to Bayreuth for
the last 10 years.
   ``But it's the new `Ring' production that's causing the most
excitement,'' he said. ``Barenboim has a special style. You really
notice when he's conducting.''
   Barenboim, musical director of the renowned Orchestre de Paris,
will conduct the four works comprising the mighty ``Der Ring des
Nibelungen'' cycle to begin on July 27 with ``Das Rheingold.'' The
other works, ``Die Walkuere,'' ``Siegfried'' and
``Goetterdaemmerung'' will follow.
   Opera lovers also say they are eager to see what East German
director Kupfer does with the new ``Ring'' production.
   ``That's the sensation of the season to me,'' August Everding,
general director of the Bayerischen Staatstheater (Bavarian State
Theater) said. ``Kupfer is a wonderful opera director.''
   Critic Koch looked to Kupfer's 1978 Bayreuth production of ``The
Flying Dutchman'' as a clue to what audiences might expect this
summer.
   ``It was highly imaginative, but critical at the same time,'' he
said. ``Kupfer manages to bring current aspects into his work, and
audiences today can easily identify with it.''
   Other festival presentations will be a return of last year's
romantic opera, ``Lohengrin'' and ``Die Meistersinger von
Nuernberg.''
   Opera singers in this year's festival include some of Bayreuth
favorites such as Siegfried Jerusalem as Parsifal and Siegfried,
Franz Mazura as Klingsor and the Wanderer, and Waltraud Meier as
Kundry and Waltraute.
   Among those appearing in Bayreuth for the first time include
Alan Opie, Marie-Claire O'Reirdan and Jane Turner.
   There will be a total of 30 performances at the festival, which
runs until Aug. 29.
   Meanwhile, Bayreuth tourist officials laugh at some aspects of
the summer invasion.
   ``We get people writing letters to the mayor asking for
tickets,'' Bayreuth Tourist director Jo Schumacher said. ``And lots
of tourists just stumble in here casually and are astounded when
they can't get tickets.''
   Bayreuth, a picturesque town founded in the 12th century, also
shows a number of art exhibits during the Wagner festival, much of
them Wagner related.

   Democrats assemble this week to give Michael
Dukakis a southern-style send-off in his race for the White House
and they can only hope that Jesse Jackson, a born scene-stealer,
will decide to play a supporting role.
   From Monday night's warbling rendition of the Star Spangled
Banner by radio personality Garrison Keillor to Thursday night's
acceptance speeches by Dukakis and running mate Lloyd Bentsen, the
Democratic Party has spent many months and many millions on a
program to boost its chances of winning the White House.
   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis marches into Dixie on Sunday as the
unquestioned nominee of his party. He has more than enough
delegates to crush any attempt by Jackson to alter the bare bones
platform he decreed, and more than enough clout to make sure the
convention ratifies his choice of Texas Sen. Bentsen as running
mate.
   But it will be up to Jackson, who has the allegiance of roughly
one quarter of the convention's 4,210 delegates, to decide how
unified and harmonious a front the party presents to the four-night
prime time audience.
   As Dukakis' last remaining rival for the nomination, he has
promised repeatedly to support the Democratic ticket this fall. But
he angrily broke off platform negotiations with Dukakis last week
after learning of Bentsen's selection from a reporter rather than
from the governor himself.
   Whatever Jackson decides _ whether he contests the platform,
tries to challenge Bentsen's spot on the ticket or leaves the Omni
to lead the thousands of supporters who say they will be in the
streets _ New Englander Dukakis' nomination will be spiced with a
southern flavor.
   House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas will preside as chairman and
Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards will deliver the keynote address
that is the highlight of Monday night's opening session. Arkansas
Gov. Bill Clinton will place Dukakis' name in nomination on Tuesday
night in another bow to a region of the country that Democrats used
to win regularly in presidential elections, but now seems largely
out of reach.
   On the first night, the assembled Democrats also will hear from
former President Jimmy Carter, a native Georgian who once served as
governor.
   Tuesday night's program is expected to begin with the platform
and end with a speech by Jackson, with appearances by Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy and other party leaders in between.
   Jackson's forces have prepared several minority planks to the
platform, and while a vote on some or all is possible, the
differences also may be ironed out in advance. Delegates will see a
video presentation about Jackson, to be introduced by his children.
   The party picks its nominee on Wednesday, with Dukakis and
Jackson the only names entered into nomination.
   Bentsen will be picked for vice president on Thursday _ with or
without a fight by the Jackson forces _ and then he and Dukakis
will deliver their acceptance speeches.
   Party officials say that anyone interested in challenging
Bentsen's nomination must submit a petition with between 300 and
600 delegate signatures by Thursday morning. Jackson has more than
enough supporters in the hall to accomplish that, if he wants.
   Whatever else happens, there will be the usual street
demonstrations outside the hall. Rumors circulated that the Ku Klux
Klan would stage a demonstration, and party spokesman Mike McCurry
said Democratic officials are concerned about the threat of
violence.
   ``That does concern the party ... we're well prepared to deal
with any situation that arises,'' he said.
   Republicans have set up a beachhead in the Democrats' host city,
and have arranged for several prominent officials to take pot shots
each day at Dukakis and Bentsen.
   The host city was busy sprucing itself up for its four days in
the glare of nationwide publicity. Municipal workers placed
planters with vibrantly colored flowers along the streets near the
convention hall.
   Dukakis campaign volunteers decorated the city with political
posters, and workers in the downtown hotels polished and repolished
every available surface in anticipation of the arrival of the
delegates.
   Dukakis goes into the convention with a modest lead over George
Bush in the public opinion polls, and he and his high command hope
to use the week to pad the margin.
   In appearances inside the convention hall and out, the
Massachusetts governor will follow a schedule designed to stress
the themes that secured him the Democratic nomination and that he
intends to repeat in the fall.
   Rather than spend his time speaking only to party delegate
caucuses, Dukakis is expected to spend part of his day campaigning
away from the hall and the glass and steel downtown hotels that
house many of the delegates.
   A trip to a factory gate is a possibility, to dramatize his
support for the plant closing law that Congress is sending to
President Reagan's desk. He may also visit a school to emphasize
his opposition to drugs.
   Aside from the prime time appearances on network television _
including the morning shows on Monday and his acceptance speech on
Thursday _ he is expected to make himself available for television
interviews by satellite with stations around the country.
   Aides say he will stress his commitment to creating jobs and his
support for health care and education, and sound the theme of
ethics in government.
   He and other speakers are expected to stress Dukakis' ethnic
roots, and the governor will be introduced to the convention and
the television audience on Thursday night by his cousin,
Oscar-winning actress Olympia Dukakis.
   Dukakis' nomination will mark the end of a marathon run for the
party's top prize.
   He began the campaign as merely one of ``seven dwarfs'' seeking
the nomination. Just as methodically as he raised millions of
campaign dollars, he methodically dispatched one rival after
another in the early primaries and caucuses.
   By the time New York held its primary in mid-April, the race had
been narrowed to Dukakis and Jackson, and there was never any doubt
about which of them would win.

<TEXT>
   When Eskimo leaders gathered in this
Kuskokwim River village four years ago to create the Yupiit Nation,
they paused for a day of fishing.
   ``There's always time for fishing,'' said Willie Kasayulie,
chief of the Yupiit Nation and chief executive officer of
Akiachak's tribal council. ``People's lives here revolve around the
river.''
   In southwestern Alaska, fishing for the salmon that migrate
upstream each summer is no recreational pursuit. The fish are a
major source of income and food for Akiachak and dozens of other
native villages along the winding ribbon of muddy water.
   The Kuskokwim River is the only highway into town. Few villagers
own a car, but nearly every household has a boat.
   Kasayulie, 37, figures he spends at least 45 days a year on the
river. Part of the time he's catching salmon for sale under his
limited-entry commercial permit. The rest of the time he's fishing
for personal use.
   He and his extended family of 16 catch up to 500 salmon a year
in driftnets strung from open riverboats. They eat most of the fish
themselves; the rest is shared with village elders who can't get
out to fish anymore.
   They cut up, dry and smoke the salmon on wooden racks at ``fish
camps'' up and down the Kuskokwim.
   A few fish are saved for ``stinkhead,'' an Eskimo treat made by
burying a salmon head in the sand. They leave the head to ferment
for 10 days or so, then dig it up, wash off the sand and eat it.
   ``They call it stinkhead because it stinks,'' Kasayulie said.
``I really like it.''
   August brings a brief respite from the river, when Kasayulie
takes the family camping for two or three days to pick about 30
gallons of blueberries, salmonberries and cranberries.
   But in the fall, he's back in his boat, heading up river to hunt
moose. And in the winter, when the river freezes solid, the fishing
begins all over again, as villagers chop holes through the ice to
fish for burbot, whitefish and pike.

<TEXT>
   In a city where bank closings have become so
common they fail to attract much notice, officials of Fondren
National Bank of Houston did something that was extraordinary but
made no headlines.
   They built a $900,000 bank building and opened it in June.
   ``Obviously if we didn't feel things were moving positively, we
wouldn't have done it,'' said Frank Goldberg, the bank's president.
``We think things are better. We know they are.''
   Fondren National, with assets of about $37 million, is far from
the largest bank in town, but the confidence officials are showing
in the city mirrors other signs that make some believe the economic
nightmare that followed the energy crash of the early 1980s is
slowly ending.
   When the oil bust hit, Houston was left with the image of a city
of empty skyscrapers, unprecedented unemployment, banking chaos and
more recently, highly publicized bankruptcies involving prominent
Texans like former Gov. John Connally and surgeon Denton Cooley.
   But even New York bond rating firms are nodding cautiously that
the worst may be over for Houston, which in the past decade used
the energy boom to push past Detroit and Philadelpia and become the
nation's fourth-largest city.
   Last month, Moody's Investor Service, swayed by optimistic pleas
from top Houston officials, kept the city's bond rating at the more
favorable ``Aa'' category.
   ``We looked at the relationship of the city's attempt to balance
the current budget and finish the year in a positive mode,'' said
Robert Stanley, a Moody's vice president.
   ``Their perceptions of Houston were wrong,'' said Paul Mabry,
spokesman for Mayor Kathryn Whitmire, explaining why Moody's
officials changed their minds.
   What Moody's officials were told is that Mrs. Whitmire will
resolve an unexpected budget deficit with a recently approved 18.9
percent tax increase. And they were delivered a rosy picture of a
city on its way back.
   For example, unemployment, at nearly 13 percent in June 1987,
most recently was reported at 7.1 percent.
   In the 12 months ending in May, employment rose by 28,000. In
May alone, Texas Employment Commission figures showed the total
number of people working rose by 15,000 to 1,495,100.
   Figures also show the city expects at least 20,000 new jobs this
year with economic growth up 2 percent and expanding in subsequent
years.
   City officials also are touting Houston's depressed housing
market as a plus for people moving in, noting that home costs and
apartment rents are among the lowest of major U.S. cities. For
example, a 2,000-square-foot, three-bedroom house that sell for
$250,000 in Boston or Los Angeles goes for a mere $80,000 in
Houston.
   Barton Smith, who heads the university of Houston's economics
department, is forecasting home prices will jump 10 percent next
year and continue to climb in the early 1990s.
   Elsewhere, shipments through the Port of Houston were 30.2
million tons through April, up 15 percent from the previous year.
   At the Texas Medical Center, construction worth $1.5 billion is
ensuring the complex remains the world's largest medical center.
   And Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. reported it installed more
new phone lines in April than any month in nearly three years.
   At federal bankruptcy court, where clerks were so busy at one
point that they refused to answer the telephone, the number of
filings has leveled off, according to a Price Waterhouse survey.
   Although the court received 429 petitions in the first quarter
of the year _ up 3 percent from the previous quarter _ the number
was 8 percent below the peak third quarter of 1986 and close to the
average 422 recorded over the past year.
   ``While the overall number of business bankruptcies increased
slightly during the first quarter, various sectors of Houston's
economy showed signs of improvement,'' said Donald Thomas of Price
Waterhouse. ``Several companies have announced relocation plans
moving them to Houston. ... With low real estate and wage costs,
Houston continues to be an attractive market for corporate
relocations.''
   One of them is Grumman Corp., which recently broke ground for a
$50 million space headquarters that is projected to add hundreds of
jobs.
   Even Houston's legendary traffic problems appear to be easing,
with freeway renovation and construction feverish. The first phase
of a long-awaited county toll road project was completed in late
June with hopes it will unclog two major freeways to the city's
northern reaches.
   On the minus side, however, are new home sales, which trail
anemic year-ago figures by 4 percent. For the first quarter of
1988, the 1,520 permits issued for single-family homes was down 22
percent from the same 1987 period.
   ``The general consensus, from the people we've talked to, is
that Houston is probably at the bottom now,'' according to Roy
Bragg, editor of the trade publication U.S. Housing Markets.
   And the energy business, spoiled when oil prices exceeded $30
per barrel and knocked nearly comatose when prices slipped beneath
$10, is learning the realities of coping with $16-18 oil.
   A survey of the city's 50 largest public companies by the weekly
Houston Business Journal shows 20 lost money in 1987, and 12 of
those 20 losers are energy-related firms.
   But a forecast by the Rice University-affiliated Center for
Economic and Demographic Forecasting says favorable trends in the
energy business should continue through 1990, with higher prices
leading to more significant recovery.
   ``For Houston's recovery to expand, conditions in the energy
industry must at least remain stable,'' said Michelle Foss, senior
associate at the center.
   Still, Rice Center economists believe that even if oil prices
soften, the city's employment should not be affected greatly.
   ``Houston's economic recovery continues and may even be picking
up speed,'' the economists said.
   At Fondren National Bank, employees and customers are glad to be
in the gleaming new building and out of the mobile home that served
as the bank's temporary quarters.
   ``We have lots of small- to medium-size businesses that are
customers,'' bank president Goldberg said. ``It's pretty much
across-the-board and not just in our minds. It's reflected in those
businesses. Things are better almost everywhere.''

   Thursday's increase reflected a rise in the banks' own borrowing

   Oil prices rebounded from steep losses earlier
in the week, but traders attributed the change to short-term
influences and to Saudi Arabia's denial that it was boosting
production.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the near-month contract for
West Texas Intermediate crude rose 32 cents per barrel from its
21-month low to close Thursday at $14.76.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale
unleaded gasoline rose .06 cent a gallon to 50.54 cents, and No. 2
heating oil rose .77 cent a gallon to 40.91 cents.
   Douglas R. Peterson, a broker at E.D.&F. Man International
Futures Inc. in New York, called it a short-covering rally, meaning
the rise was caused by speculators who purchased oil to cover
borrowed contracts that they had sold earlier. Short-covering is an
internal market influence that causes brief price rises.
   Others attributed the advance to official Saudi denials of
expanded production by the world's largest oil exporter.
   There have been repeated reports that Saudi Arabia and its key
Arab allies in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
are sharply raising output in reaction to widespread quota cheating
by other OPEC members. These reports have played a major role in
the oil market's recent decline.
   Other rumors circulating in the market suggested the Saudis were
selling more oil to pay for their multibillion-dollar weapons deal
with Britain.
   The Saudi Press Agency said the country was the victim of an
``artificial information campaign ... by oil brokers and their
agents in the market.''
   ``The kingdom strongly denies the truth of such charges and
wishes to reaffirm its full commitment to its assigned level of
production by OPEC,'' the statement read.

   It is no accident that many department stores
put their cosmetics counters just inside the front door, the area
with the highest customer traffic.
   When Bloomingdale's redid the first floor of its flagship
Manhattan store a few years ago, the centerpiece was the makeup and
perfume department.
   It also is no accident that the front pages of women's magazines
often are dominated by ads for Revlon, Estee Lauder, Clairol, Coty
and other big names in beauty, while inside, articles dispense tips
on how women can totally make themselves over.
   Cosmetics is a big and lucrative business, bringing in $17
billion in sales last year.
   The world's largest cosmetic company, Avon Products Inc., had
1987 sales of nearly $1.81 billion from its cosmetics, fragrances
and toiletries business. That produced a $251.3 million pre-tax
profit.
   Numbers like that make successful cosmetic companies desirable
properties. Ronald O. Perelman battled for three months in 1985
before finally winning a $1.65 billion takeover fight for Revlon
Inc., one of the world's top cosmetic manufacturers.
   The profitable business lately has come under scrutiny by
Congress, too. The House small business panel on Wednesday held a
hearing to examine health and safety questions about cosmetics,
some of which are said to contain chemicals that could cause
cancer, birth defects, central nervous disorders, skin and eye
irritations and allergic reactions.
   Cosmetics are profitable because they are relatively inexpensive
to produce and their prices can be marked up heavily because of
snob appeal. The cosmetic industry has its own equivalent of
designer fashions.
   For example, a mascara by Maybelline was priced at $3 in a
Manhattan drug store, while a similar Estee Lauder product sold for
$10 at Saks Fifth Avenue.
   Manufacturers and retailers both are big beneficiaries of
makeup's high profit margins.
   ``If you pay $10 for an item, the manufacturer probably gets
$6,'' leaving $4 for the retailer, said Diana Temple, a cosmetic
industry analyst for the investment firm Salomon Brothers Inc.
   One reason why retailers do so well from makeup is that at
bigger department and specialty stores, such as Bloomingdale's,
Marshall Field's, Nordstrom and Macy's, the people selling the
cosmetics often are paid at least in part by the manufacturer, Ms.
Temple said.
   In shopping for cosmetics, women generally are motivated by
price and the image created for the product by ad campaigns.
   But if you put the Maybelline mascara and the Estee Lauder item
side by side, is there any difference between the ingredients of
the two?
   ``Not a heck of a lot,'' said Jack Salzman, an analyst with the
investment firm Goldman Sachs & Co.
   ``There are differences in quality but the differences in price
are greater,'' Ms. Temple said.
   Cosmetics sell because they can make women more glamorous. But
they also have given the people associated with the industry their
own special aura.
   The late Charles Revson, one of the founders of Revlon, was
constantly in the society pages. And actress Lauren Hutton made it
into the movies after her impeccably made-up face appeared in many
a Revlon ad.

<HEAD>Long-Distance Commercials Take Lighter Approach</HEAD>

   You can quit cringing at the first sight of
those long-distance telephone commercials: telephone admakers plan
to lighten up.
   AT&T is winding down its use of ads that show corporate
underlings getting chewed out by the boss _ or worrying that they
might be fired _ for picking the wrong telephone service. Instead,
it is phasing in new ads that show its employees describing how
they can help your business.
   Competitor US Sprint, meanwhile, plans to begin using a new
series of ads next week that indirectly pokes fun at AT&T's old
approach as it humorously demonstrates how important it is to get a
clear line when you want to place a business call.
   The ads were directed by Joe Sedelmaier, best known for his
``Where's the Beef'' ads for Wendy's and his fast-talker spots for
Federal Express.
   In one new Sprint ad, four men are in an office waiting for the
boss's call. ``That's him,'' they say as the phone rings.
   But as the camera catches every expressive twitch of the face of
the guy who picks up the phone, the boss' instructions are reduced
to gibberish because of the poor quality of the phone line.
   ``Listen carefully ..500 cases .. by Monday ... we'll lose the
account'' are some of the fragments that can be heard.
   After the boss hangs up, the man who took the call dutifully
repeats for the others exactly what he heard.
   The message is that this won't happen if you use Sprint. But
there is no suggestion that somebody is about to lose his job over
it.
   Sprint executives and their admakers at J. Walter Thompson in
San Francisco said they felt the ads coming from American Telephone
& Telegraph Co. and, to a lesser extent, from MCI Communications
Corp. were ``depressing and colorless.''
   ``We wanted to be upbeat. We wanted to be fiesty, and we wanted
to poke fun at AT&T who lately have been taking themselves too
seriously,'' said Sherry Carniglia, the Sprint account director for
Thompson.
   MCI, which is based in Washington, D.C., has been using a series
of ads that show no-nonsense business types who describe a wide
range of MCI services that they say helps businesses operate more
efficiently and at lower cost.
   In one ad, an MCI technical supervisor looks wistfully out his
office window and says, ``Maybe some day we'll work 9 to 5. At
least that's what I tell my wife.'' In another ad, a comptroller
snaps, ``I want to know where every dollar is going,'' and adds
that MCI's billing itemizes every call.
   But the Sprint admakers also wanted to be noticed, and felt
Sedelmaier's deft touch for making people smile could help them do
that.
   Sprint, a joint venture of GTE Corp. of Stamford, Conn., and
United Telecommunications Inc. of Kansas City, Mo., is running
behind AT&T and MCI in the estimated $50 billion a year
long-distance market.
   Jack Grubman, telecommunications analyst for the investment firm
PaineWebber, estimates AT&T has about 72-73 percent of the
intercity long-distance market, while MCI had about 10 percent and
Sprint about 7 percent.
   The companies refuse to say how much they spend on advertising.
   Burke Stinson, an AT&T district manager in New York, said the
company knew that the grim ads it put on the air last winter would
make some people uneasy, but believed they would get the attention
of decisionmakers in small- and medium-size businesses.
   He said the plan always had been to run the first wave of ads
for about six months, and then phase them out by the fall as a
second wave of ads rolled out that featured bright AT&T employees
talking about what the company offers.
   ``The plan was to get people's attention. Then the question has
to be `How are you going to help me?''' Stinson said.

<TEXT>
   A court-ordered rematch of the proxy fight beween
Coniston Group and Gillette Co. would be unprecedented and would
strengthen the New York partnership's attempt to control the
personal care giant, according to industry analysts.
   A federal judge said Wednesday he was inclined to order a new
proxy vote in the six-month battle because Gillette misled
stockholders about Coniston before the election.
   Analysts said institutional investors, seeking a quick profit
from the personal care giant, probably own more Gillette stock than
before the April vote and would be more likely to back Coniston's
dissident slate of board candidates.
   Coniston controls about 5.8 percent of Gillette's common shares
outstanding. The partnership wants to win board seats to pressure
the 12-member Gillette board to sell the company, which Coniston
believes would boost the value of its stock.
   ``I think it's safe to assume that there are more arbitragers
holding Gillette today than back in March,'' said Nancy Hall, an
analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham. ``I think that Gillette is
definitely viewed as a speculative plot.''
   Judges in the past have ordered new proxy votes, but that
typically has been in cases involving huge vote discrepancies where
a new vote was deemed irrelevant. The Gillette case is rarer
because it involves information a judge determined could have
affected the outcome.
   ``The court found that there was something misleading,'' said
Robert Todd Lang, a partner with the New York law firm Weil
Gotschal & Manges. ``This doesn't happen very often. Usually when
you have a challenge it's a challenge to the tally.''
   In the April 21 election, Gillette's 27,000 shareholders
rejected Coniston's slate of four candidates to the board by 52
percent to 48 percent proportion.
   U.S. District Judge Mark L. Wolf said at Wednesday's hearing
that he was inclined to order a new election because ``the essence
of the election was tainted in a material way.''
   Last week, Wolf ruled Gillette misled stockholders about
Coniston in newspaper advertisements leading up to the proxy vote.
He also said a failure by Boston-based Gillette to disclose a
series of standstill agreements with potential suitors was not
misleading and would not have affected the election.
   Wolf scheduled a trial the week of Aug. 22 on Gillette's charges
that Coniston violated federal securities laws by failing to
disclose the limited partners in RB Partners, a Bahamian company
formed to buy Gillette stock.
   The judge said Wednesday that regardless of his ruling in the
second phase of the case, he is likely to order the new vote.
Coniston has asked for a new election of eight directors in the
fall, pre-empting Gillette's normal spring meeting.
   Coniston principal Augustus K. Oliver said stockholders would
consider the standstill agreements _ under which 10 companies
agreed not to attempt to buy Gillette for two years ending in
November _ if Wolf orders a new election.
   ``I think there's a totally new mix of information available to
stockholders,'' Oliver said. ``We'll just have to see next time
around whether that's enough to change things.''
   Gillette sued Coniston in April, alleging the securities law
violations. The New York investment firm responded with its claim
of misrepresentation.
   The counterclaim was heard in court first because Judge Rya
Zobel, then handling the case, felt that if Coniston lost its
challenge to the proxy vote then Gillette's case would be moot.
   ``The judge indicated he was still evolving his thinking and he
hasn't come up with a remedy yet,'' Gillette spokesman David Fausch
said. ``One of the remedies that is possible is a new election.
Let's take that at face value.''

<TEXT>
   Uncertainty over U.S. trade figures due out later
in the day kept the dollar within a narrow range in Tokyo today and
held down stock prices, traders said.
   ``Everyone was cautious about taking a direction with the dollar
because of the upcoming trade figures,'' said Hajime Sugiyama of
the Bank of Tokyo. ``People are unsure what kind of figures to
expect. As a result, the dollar could go either way next week.''
   U.S. trade figures for May were to be announced later today in
Washington.
   Traders said the dollar's overnight gain in New York, reflecting
higher U.S. interest rates, helped boost the U.S. currency's
opening in Tokyo to 133.37 yen, up 0.42 yen from Thursday's close.
   The dollar then stayed within a narrow range throughout the day,
ending the week at 133.40 yen, up 0.45 yen from Thursday's final
figure. Spot volume was estimated at $5.9 billion.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
first rose, then dropped as participants took to the sidelines to
await the trade figures, a trader at Daiwa Securities said.
   ``With little demand for new purchases, prices began falling
almost across the board,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The Nikkei index, which gained 63.98 points Thursday, lost
170.29 points or 0.6 percent, closing at 27,913.79. Volume on the
market's first section was estimated at a light 2 billion shares,
down slightly from Thursday's 2.2 billion shares.

<HEAD>Farmers Welcomes Oregon Rejection Of Hostile Takeover Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Farmers Group Inc. says a hostile
takeover attempt of the company by a British conglomerate should be
dropped following the rejection of the plan by Oregon's insurance
commissioner.
   Batus Inc., a Louisville, Ky.-based subsidiary of the British
B.A.T. Industries PLC, has offered $4.5 billion for the Los
Angeles-based Farmers. Farmers directors rejected the proposal.
   Oregon Insurance Commissioner Ted Kulongoski concluded on
Thursday that the proposed buyout of Farmers Insurance Co. of
Oregon would adversely affect Farmers' policyholders and
competition in Oregon's insurance trade.
   Kulongoski cited the intention of Batus, which owns a major
tobacco company, to restrict the non-smoker policies sold by
Farmers.
   ``Director Kulongoski's decision on this matter confirms our
belief that this proposed transaction would ultimately be
detrimental to Farmers and its Oregon policyholders,'' said Leo E.
Denlea Jr., Farmers' chairman.
   Batus said in a statement it was ``completely astonished'' by
the decision.
   ``A cursory reading of the decision strongly suggests that the
commissioner has reached conclusions that are contrary to law and
appear to be unsupported by the record and the facts,'' a spokesman
said.
   Kulongoski's order can be appealed to the courts. The takeover
bid as now structured would require approval of insurance
regulators in nine states.
   California's insurance commissioner also has rejected the
proposal, and Arizona has approved it.
   ``Following the recent decision by the California Department of
Insurance, this is a second very significant setback to Batus'
unwanted hostile takeover attempt,'' Denlea said. ``We believe that
Batus will face further regulatory difficulties in current and
pending reviews by other state insurance departments.''
   Kulongoski, citing his role as hearings officer in the case,
made only limited remarks outside his statements in the order.
   He said the case is unique in Oregon insurance history because
it does not involve a troubled insurer being acquired by a more
financially sound company.
   ``Rather, it is the proposed acquisition of a very well-managed
company by a larger company seeking to diversify into the financial
services market in this country,'' Kulongoski said.
   Batus' statement also took issue with Kulongoski's
characterization of Farmers as well-managed.
   The ``statement to the effect that this is not a financially
distressed company, but rather a well-managed one being acquired by
a larger company seeking to diversify, suggests that the decision
is anti-takeover, rather than protection for the policyholders,''
the statement said.
   The commissioner in his ruling said the proposed acquisition
``subjects policyholders and shareholders to substantial risks
while providing no benefit that Farmers does not already enjoy.''
   He also said the continued denials by B.A.T. and Batus ``of the
known adverse health effects of tobacco smoking, and its stated
intentions of precluding Farmers from referring to such health
effects in its marketing literature, do not promote the interest of
the insurance-buying public.''
   Batus owns Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. along with retail
concerns including Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises on Trade Report</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: updates with dollar rising strongly after trade report.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose strongly today after the U.S.
government reported that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened
to $10.9 billion in May, less than expected.
   Gold prices fell in morning trading.
   The dollar rose almost one cent against the British pound and
nearly one Japanese yen in London after the Commerce Department
reported the second smallest deficit in almost three years. The
U.S. currency also surged higher in New York trading.
   The markets had been predicting a deficit of around $11 billion
after a deficit of $9.9 billion in April.
   The dollar had moved higher in calm European trading in advance
of the report. Foreign exchange dealers said that although market
turnover was somewhat subdued ahead of the announcement, the
currency was buoyed by optimism over the trade deficit.
   In London, it cost $1.6730 to buy one pound after the report,
cheaper than $1.6820 at midmorning and $1.6890 late Thursday.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.8655 West German marks, up from 1.8475; 1.5465
Swiss francs, up from 1.5320; 6.2860 French francs, up from 6.2315;
2.1030 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0815; 1,380.98 Italian lire, up
from 1,367.75; 1.2088 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2085.
   In Tokyo, the dollar ended the week at 133.40 yen, up 0.45 yen
from Thursday's close. Later, in London, after the release of the
report, it was quoted at 134.75 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $438 a troy ounce and at
midmorning the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $438.10. Both were lower than Thursday's late
bid of $439.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $438, down from late Thursday's
$441. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold dropped 48 cents an ounce to
close at a bid of $440.05.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $7.30 late this
morning, down from late Thursday's $7.35.

   Stock prices were sharply lower Friday in
anticipation of a possible rise in British interest rates.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was down 11.1
points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,852.2 at midday. Volume was light at
288.8 million shares, compared with 297.8 million shares at the
same time Thursday.
   The index was fell sharply as expectations increased that the
British commercial banks' base lending rate might rise above the
current 10 percent.
   Late in the morning, the government reported that Britain's
retail price index rose 0.4 percent in June from May and was up 4.6
percent from June 1987.
   The annual inflation rate was at the high end of market
expectations, and confirmed expectations tht interest rates might
be headed higher in the near term.
   Jeffrey Thompson, an equities strategist at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd Ltd., said he doubted the Bank of England would engineer a
base rate rise ahead of the release of the U.S. trade numbers.
   ``Monday could certainly provide the right sort of opportunity''
he said, adding: ``I think we're in for a spell of inflation and
interest rate fears over the next few weeks.''

<HEAD>Macmillan To Appeal Injunction Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Macmillan Inc. said it would appeal a judge's
ruling that blocks the publishing giant from proceeding with a
massive massive restructuring designed to thwart an unwanted bid
from the Robert Bass Group.
   After nearly five weeks of consideration, Jack B. Jacobs of the
Delaware Chancery Court on Thursday issued a 58-page opinion
granting Bass's request for a preliminary injunction that
effectively blocks the restructuring.
   Macmillan said in a statement that it was taking an expedited
appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court in an effort to reverse the
decision.
   An unidentified Macmillan spokesman said in the statement that
Jacobs' ruling was ``erroneous as a matter of law'' and that
Macmillan was confident of succeeding on appeal.
   The ruling came after the close of the stock market. But in
trading on te New York Stock Exchange, Macmillan fell 50 cents to
$74 on Thursday.
   Josy Ingersoll, an attorney representing the Texas-based Bass
group, had no comment on whether Bass would proceed with a tender
offer. The group previously had said it would launch a tender offer
upon granting of a preliminary injunction.
   ``There's no action to prevent anybody from doing a tender
offer,'' she said. The Bass group also has said it has the
necessary financing to complete its $1.9 billion buyout.
   Bass originally offered to acquire Macmillan for $64 a share in
May, but raised his bid to $73 a share, or about $1.9 billion for
the 90.1 percent of Macmillan shares the group does not already own
after the publisher unveiled its restructuring plan.
   Ingersoll said the judge found that Macmillan's attempt to
restructure was an unreasonable response to Bass's takeover
proposal.
   Based on legal precedents, ``when a board does something in
reaction to an offer for the company, there has to be a threat ...
and there wasn't a threat'' in this case, she said from her
Wilmington, Del. office.
   Bass had charged that Macmillan's restructuring, which would
have separated the company's information services and publishing
operations into two separate, publicly traded companies, was
inadequate and misleading. The group also charged that the plan
would have transferred control to four top Macmillan executives for
a cheap price.
   In rejecting Bass's buyout offer as well as a counter proposal
to restructure the company, Macmillan repeatedly said its own plan
was in the best interest of shareholders.
   Macmillan was just hours away from beginning its restructuring,
which included paying shareholders a special $52.35-a-share
dividend, when Jacobs issued a temporary restraining order on June
10.
   Bass's restructuring plan would pay shareholders a dividend of
$58 per share.

<HEAD>Report Calls For Improved Working, Living Conditions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government report, noting that Japanese work
longer than people in other industrialized nations but have less
buying power, calls for improved working and living conditions in
this country.
   The report, issued by the Labor Ministry Friday, urged shorter
work weeks, lower consumer prices, more housing land and cheaper
housing.
   The report said Japanese worked an average 2,150 hours in 1986,
the last year for which such statistics were available, compared to
1,938 hours for Britons, 1,924 hours for Americans, 1,655 hours for
West Germans and 1,643 hours for the French, said Atsuko Ishii of
the ministry's Labor Affairs Division.
   Of Japan's total workforce of 60.8 million, 59.11 were employed
in 1987, for an unemployment rate of 2.8 percent compared to 6.2
percent in the United States, 7.9 percent in West Germany, 10.4
percent in Britain and 10.6 percent in France, according to Miss
Ishii.
   Japan calculates its unemployment rate differently from other
Western countries, counting its armed forces and those who work as
little as one hour a month. Japanese officials say Japan's official
rate would be about double if it were calculated by Western methods.
   Women accounted for 36.5 percent of the work force last year,
the report said.
   The average worker's annual salary in 1987 was 4.99 million yen,
or $38,380, including summer and winter bonuses, Miss Ishii quoted
the report as saying.
   Workers in primary industry _ farming, forestry, fishing and
mining _ numbered 5.41 million, or 9.3 percent of all workers, in
1985, the most recent year for which statistics were available, she
said.
   In the secondary or manufacturing industry, there were 19.33
million workers, or 33.1 percent of the working population.
   The largest number of workers in 1985 were 33.44 million in
tertiary industry, defined as power and water supply, transport,
communications, sales, food, financial, real estate and public
sectors, the report said. They represented 53.7 percent of Japan's
working population that year, Miss Ishii said.
   The report noted 18.9 percent of Japan's workforce was older
than 55 last year, as opposed to 12.9 percent in the United States
and 10.2 percent in West Germany.

   Stock prices headed higher today, inspired by
news of a smaller-than-expected monthly U.S. trade deficit
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.93 to 2,120.55 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 4 in the early tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 531 up, 300 down and
501 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 43.21 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The dollar jumped after the Commerce Department reported that
the merchandise trade deficit in May was $10.9 billion, the second
smallest in almost three years. The April deficit was revised
upward to $10.3 billion from $9.9 billion.
   In other economic news, the Labor Department said wholesale
prices rose 0.4 percent in June despite a drought that sent prices
for raw food soaring at their steepest pace in more than 2{ years.
   Industrial production rose 0.4 percent in June, the ninth
consecutive month without a decline, the Federal Reserve said.
   Among blue-chip issues, International Business Machines stock
gained 1 to 125}. The company said its second-quarter profit fell
18.1 because of a restructuring charge. Earnings would have risen
12.7 percent without the charge.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.29 to 153.05. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .44 at 308.58.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.25 to

   Britain's annual consumer inflation rate rose to
4.6 percent in June, up 0.4 percent from the previous month, the
government reported Friday.
   Market forecasts had called for an annual rise of 4.3 percent to
4.6 percent and a month-to-month rise of between 0.1 percent to 0.4
percent.
   The Department of Employment attributed the monthly rise to
higher prices for motor vehicles, non-seasonal foods, gasoline and
clothing.
   The index, which uses a January 1987 basis of 100, stood at
106.6 in June, up from 106.2 in May and 102 in June 1987.

   Wholesale prices one step short of retail rose
a moderate 0.4 percent in June, the government said today. But the
drought searing much of the nation sent prices for raw food soaring
at their steepest pace in more than 2{ years.
   The Labor Department said raw costs jumped 4.2 percent last
month, a rate not seen since the 5.1 percent climb of October 1985.
Further along in the wholesale process, however, prices for foods
ready to be retailed rose 1.1 percent, reflecting earlier, though
less severe, increases in raw food costs.
   Some examples of price increases at the unprocessed-food level:
   _Wheat, 25.3 percent.
   _Corn, 24.3 percent.
   _Turkeys, 22.8 percent.
   _Soybeans 22.0 percent.
   _Chickens, 22.5 percent.
   Reflecting the fact that many farmers are slaughtering animals
they cannot afford or find feed for, cattle prices fell 5.2 percent
while hog prices were down 4.0 percent.
   The news was not quite so severe at the finished-goods level.
Prices for eggs rose 16.0 percent while turkey prices gained 9.3
percent, chicken prices jumped 7.3 percent and fresh fruit costs
gained 6.7 percent.
   Those gains were partially offset by a 5.7 percent decline in
vegetable prices and a 2.2 percent decrease for rice.
   Stacy Kottman, an economist at Georgia State University, said
that prices of foods made from grain, such a vegetable oils, bakery
products and pasta, likely will continue to rise, and that the drop
in vegetable prices won't last. Meat prices should continue to fall
through late autumn, but will then head higher after the
drought-induced slaughtering tails off, he said.
   ``Next year we'll probably see the full impact of the drought,
particularly if it persists. Up until this week we could say,
`Well, if we get some rain, we'll probably be all right.' But this
week is the last week we can say that,'' he said.
   Energy prices, meanwhile, fell at the finished level by 1.6
percent. Leading the way was a drop of 7.1 percent for fuel oil
while declines of 2.4 percent and 1.0 percent were posted for
gasoline and natural gas respectively.
   Further energy price declines are considered likely because
crude oil prices have fallen over the last month to their lowest
levels in nearly two years.
   ``We can just thank our fortunes that OPEC can't get together on
restraint of production. I hate to think what the report would look
like if oil prices were rising,'' Kottman said.
   In other economic news:
   _The Commerce Department said the U.S. trade deficit rose
slightly in May to $10.9 billion, but the imbalance was still the
second smallest in almost three years. The gap between imports and
exports widened by $627 million from a revised April imbalance of
$10.3 billion.
   _The Federal Reserve Board said production at the nation's
factories, mines and utilities rose a moderate 0.4 percent in June,
the ninth consecutive month without a decline. The June increase,
boosted by an increase in electricity use during the heat wave,
pushed industrial output 5.8 percent higher than it was a year ago.
   _Business inventories in May rose a moderate 0.6 percent to
$728.4 billion, held in check by a 0.9 percent jump in sales to
$483.7 billion, the Commerce Department said.
   Overall, if the June increase in wholesale finished goods prices
held for 12 straight months, the inflation rate would be 4.6
percent annually, more than double the 2.2 percent rise of 1987.
   Subtracting the effects of volatile food and energy prices,
wholesale prices rose 0.3 percent last month.
   Analysts consider this rate a better indication of the economy's
underlying inflation. Even with steep food price gains anticipated
for the several months, many economists feel the effect of those
gains will be only temporary.
   For the first half of 1988, prices one step short of retail rose
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.6 percent. Excluding food
and energy prices, wholesale costs rose 4.0 over that period.
   Prices from March through June have risen at a monthly rate of
either 0.4 percent or 0.5 percent.
   At the finished level, the department gave these other price
changes:
   _Passenger car prices, up 1.0 percent.
   _Women's clothing, up 1.0 percent.
   _Home electronic equipment, down 2.2 percent.
   _Cosmetics, down 0.6 percent.
   The June increase brought the wholesale price index for finished
goods to 107.9, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods
costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $107.90 last month, 40 cents
more than in May.
   This calculation is not adjusted for seasonal variations, as are
other calculations in the report.
   The Consumer Price Index, which tracks services and imported
goods not included in the wholesale price report, has risen at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.4 percent over the first five
months of the year, the same rate as for all of 19878.
   Consumer price figures for June will be released next week.

   America's trade deficit expanded only slightly in May and
inflation remained moderate in June, the government said today in
encouraging reports that sent the dollar soaring.
   The Commerce Department said the trade deficit rose to $10.9
billion in May from a revised $10.3 billion in April, but the
number was still the second smallest in almost three years and well
within economists' expectations.
   Imports rose 3.4 percent to about $37.6 billion, but the
increase was offset by a 2.3 percent increase in exports, which
rose to about $26.6 billion, very close to the record level for
exports set in March.
   The Labor Department said wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.4
percent in June, despite a searing drought that sent prices for raw
food soaring at their steepest pace in more than 2{ years.
   In other reports released today, the Federal Reserve said June
industrial production rose 0.4 percent, largely because of higher
electricity output, and the Commerce Department said May business
inventories rose 0.6 percent, which suggested a slight slowdown in
sales.
   But those reports weren't watched as closely as the news on
trade and inflation, which was better than many thought and sent
money traders scrambling to buy dollars. The currency's strong
advance prompted some central banks to sell dollars in the market
to stem the rise, traders reported.
   In New York, the dollar surged over 1.8750 marks in hectic
trading, compared with 1.8507 late Thursday, and 135.10 Japanese
yen compared with 133.18 late Thursday. The British pound fell to
$1.662 from $1.689.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
about 7 points to the 2,121 level in early trading, but retreated
by late morning. In the bond market, the Treasury's key 30-year
issue also rose on the trade and inflation news but fell back later
and was little changed by late morning.
   On Thursday, the markets reacted indifferently to a hike in the
prime rate by major banks from 9 percent to 9.5 percent, the
highest in more than two years. Stocks and the dollar rose slightly
and bonds were mixed.
   The banks' hike in the prime rate, which had been widely
expected in the financial markets, reflected a rise in their own
borrowing costs and signaled more expensive loans for consumers and
businesses.
   The move marked the second time this year the nation's banks
have raised the prime, which is used to calculate a range of
fixed-and adjustable-rate corporate and consumer loans.
   Economists had been expecting such a move because of evidence
that the Federal Reserve has tightened credit over the past few
months in an attempt to curb inflation.
   The rate increase came one day after the central bank's
chairman, Alan Greenspan, told Congress that the Fed had been
tightening and that holding down inflation remained his key
priority. Some economists saw a significant connection between his
remarks and the banks' action.
   In other economic news on Thursday:
   _The Commerce Department said retail sales rose a moderate 0.5
percent to a seasonally adjusted $132.8 billion in June. It said
sales rose 0.3 percent in May, an upward revision from the previous
estimate of 0.1 percent.
   _President Reagan toured the drought-stricken Farm Belt and
promised farmers that ``we will do everything that we can'' to
help. At the same time, he called on Congress to act quickly on a
package of legislation aimed at making emergency federal aid
available to farmers.
   _The Senate Agriculture Committee approved disaster legislation
that would provide payments of up to $100,000 each to farmers whose
crops have been wrecked by the drought.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Lower, Turn Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened lower but
quickly turned mixed in volatile activity today on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Analysts attributed the lower opening to a continuation of the
profit-taking that surfaced late in Thursday's session following
two days of sharply higher prices.
   Forecasts for another month of hot, dry weather in the parched
Corn Belt provided incentive for traders to bid prices higher this
morning but uncertainty about the prospects for rain next week
added an element of edginess to the markets, analysts said,
   ``People are not sure we're not going to get another rain front
in the middle of next week and the markets are very, very
nervous,'' said Ted Mao, grain specialist in New York with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   In early trading, wheat was 3 cents to 7 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.91 a bushel; corn was 3{ cents
lower to 1} cents higher with July at $3.36 a bushel; oats were 1
cent lower to 3 cents higher with July at $3.07 a bushel; soybeans
were unchanged to 15{ cents higher with July at $9.81 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .25 cent higher with August
at 64.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .85 cent
higher with August at 74.65 cents a pound; hogs were .27 cent lower
to .65 cent higher with July at 45.77 cents a pound; frozen pork

<HEAD>Teamsters Board Picks McCarthy as Union President</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Combines pvs. Also moving on general news wires.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   William J. McCarthy, the Teamsters' top man in
New England for two decades, today upset Jackie Presser's
hand-picked choice to succeed him as president of the nation's
largest union.
   The Teamsters' 1-member General Executive Board picked McCarthy,
69, of Boston over Secretary-Treasurer Weldon Mathis, who Presser
had named acting president on May 4.
   While several of the Teamsters' 16 regional vice presidents had
jockeyed for position to succeed Presser, the race had narrowed to
McCarthy and Mathis in the last week.
   McCarthy, who has a reputation of being a tough negotiator with
a quick temper, will serve out Presser's five-year term, which
expires in 1991, when the union holds its next international
convention.
   Presser, 61, had been president of the 1.6-million member union
since 1983. At the time of his death from cancer last Saturday, he
was under federal indictment on charges of labor racketeering and
embezzlement.
   The government is attempting to seize control of the union
through a court-appointed trustee, claiming its entire leadership
is either under the control of organized crime figures or incapable
of removing their influence from Teamster affairs.
   Among the allegations in the government takeover suit filed two
weeks ago is that mob bosses in Chicago and New York were behind
elevating Roy Williams to the union's presidency in 1981 and
Presser to the post in 1983.
   A federal criminal court jury in May found that the government
lacked sufficient proof, and attorneys for the union have
vehemently argued there is no organized crime influence at the top
of the union.
   While several of the Teamsters' 16 regional vice presidents had
jockeyed for the position, sources close to the union said the race
had narrowed to Mathis and McCarthy.
   Mathis, 62, was picked by Presser in 1985 to be the Teamsters'
No. 2 official. A year later, Presser engineered a change in the
union's constitution so that Mathis rather than First Vice
President Joseph Trerotola of New York would fill his shoes if he
were incapacitated.
   McCarthy, a Teamster vice president since 1969, was said by
several sources Thursday to have the support of at least seven
other board members, including Trerotola, veteran head of the
union's East Coast operations.
   ``The Presser forces have lined up behind Mathis and the
Trerotola forces have lined up behind McCarthy,'' one source said
Thursday. ``Everyone's reading is that it is real close.''
   Breaking a long-held tradition to keep internal disputes among
Teamster leaders behind closed doors, McCarthy has spoken out in
local union halls condemning the union's new three-year National
Master Freight Agreement with the trucking industry.
   The contract covering some 200,000 members was rejected in May
by 64 percent of those voting. However, Mathis declared it ratified
under the union's constitution, which requires a two-thirds no vote
for disapproval.
   According to one source, Mathis offered during a board meeting
two weeks ago in Montreal to support McCarthy for the No. 2 job but
McCarthy declined.
   Ten days after he was named acting president, Mathis resigned as
president of Teamsters Local 728 in Atlanta, his base of power in
the union. The Labor Department is investigating allegations of
vote fraud made by dissidents who had challenged Mathis'
re-election as the local's president last fall.

   Stock prices pulled back today after an early
advance faded.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 10 points in
the early going, was down 4.80 at 2,108.82 by noontime on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 517 up, 701 down and
538 unchanged.
   The market registered a brief favorable response to the Commerce
Department report that the merchandise trade deficit in May was
$10.9 billion, slightly below most advance estimates.
   However, analysts noted that the deficit figure for April was
revised upward to $10.3 billion from $9.9 billion.
   In other economic news, the Labor Department said wholesale
prices rose 0.4 percent in June. That too came in lower than
expected, considering the surge in prices of many farm commodities
as a result of the drought.
   Industrial production rose 0.4 percent in June, the ninth
consecutive month without a decline, the Federal Reserve said.
   International Business Machines rose ~ to 125|. The company said
its second-quarter profit fell 18.1 because of a restructuring
charge. Earnings would have risen 12.7 percent without the charge.
   Interco jumped 5] to 54\. Harvey Saligman, the company's chief
executive, said he plans to recommend a major restructuring.
   Rollins Environmental fell 1\ to 18. The company reported that
earnings for the quarter ended June 30 rose to 20 cents a share
from 16 cents in the comparable period a year earlier, but the
figure evidently fell short of investors' expectations.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .16 to 152.60. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .02 at 308.16.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 111.85 million shares at
noontime, against 103.50 million at the same point Thursday.

<TEXT>
   J. Hoyle Rymer has resigned as president of
the Magic Chef Co., which was founded by his grandfather S.B. Rymer
in 1916, officials of Maytag Corp. said Friday.
   Magic Chef, a manufacturer of cooking appliances such as stoves
and microwave ovens and marketer of a full line of major home
appliances, merged with Maytag in May 1986. Magic Chef is based in
Cleveland, Tenn.
   C. Wayne Creagan, president of Maytag's diversified products
division, will take over Aug. 1 for Rymer, Maytag Chairman Daniel
J. Krumm said.
   Rymer, 43, has been president of Magic Chef since 1978. His
resignation is effective Aug. 1.
   ``I think he just wants to pursue personal interests and other
business interests,'' said Maytag spokesman Jim Powell.
   Maytag had sales of $1.9 billion in 1987. Magic Chef had net
sales of $975 million in 1985, its last full year of operation
before the merger.
   Powell said the corporation does not break out sales figures for
its 14 divisions.
   Maytag previously reported that its profits in the first three
months of this year dropped to $32.5 million, or 43 cents a share,
from a record $41.2 million, or 49 cents a share, in the same
period last year.
   Rymer had served as the general manager of Magic Chef's
microwave division, company vice president of operations and was
elected to the board of directors in 1977.
   Creagan, 59, joined Maytag in 1948, working in the engineering
department and serving as the company's vice president of labor
relations. He became senior vice president of human resources when
Maytag and Magic Chef merged and was elected to Maytag's board of
directors in February.

<TEXT>
   Like a casino player fingering the chips in his
pocket, corporate raider Carl C. Icahn is likely to wait awhile
before he walks up to the window and cashes in his Texaco Inc.
stock for a multimillion-dollar prize.
   The beleagured oil giant's largest shareholder and most vocal
critic is just days away from being able to sell his roughly 36
million shares and keep the profits.
   But will he?
   Speaking from his new offices in Mount Kisco, N.Y., Icahn said
that ``at this point we haven't made any decision yet'' about the
14.8 percent Texaco stake.
   He noted there is ``a myriad of possibilities _ including doing
nothing _ and we've made no determination of what we're going to
do.''
   Under the ``short-swing'' profit rule, a holder of more than 5
percent of a company's stock must keep those shares for at least
six months, otherwise any profits revert back to the company. That
period ends Wednesday for Icahn.
   Texaco stock traded at just over $45 a share on Friday. At that
price, Icahn has a paper profit of about $410 million, based on his
average purchase price of $34 a share.
   Wall Streeters agree Icahn is least likely to just dump the
shares on the open market, considering the depressing effect such a
move would have on Texaco's stock price.
   ``The bottom line is that neither Texaco nor Icahn want to see
the shares go down,'' said Paul Ting, an analyst at the investment
firm Oppenheimer & Co.
   Far more handsome would be the sale of Icahn's shares in a block
to a third party willing to pay a heftier price. At $60 a share,
the price Icahn put on the table in his proposed $14 billion-plus
buyout, he would reap nearly a billion in profits.
   Icahn would not comment on whether he had spoken recently with
Husky Oil Ltd. or Gulf Canada Ltd., two companies with whom he once
discussed a joint Texaco bid.
   ``It's impossible to know if he is under pressure to liquidate
something,'' said Rosario Ilacqua, a vice president at Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc. ``But if he believes the assets
are worth $70 to $80 a share, why would he sell at $46?''
   When asked whether Texaco had been in contact with Icahn
regarding the disposition of his holdings, a spokeswoman said the
White Plains, N.Y.-based company ``does not comment on the
activities of our shareholders.''
   But a source close to the company said, ``Obviously (Texaco) is
concerned about Icahn, they know that he is not someone you take
lightly.''
   ``I would assume Texaco management would like to get him out,
and get their stock up in the $50s,'' Ilacqua said.
   Icahn's concession of defeat in a heated proxy contest for five
seats on Texaco's board does not put the oil giant's managment in
the clear.
   Some experts speculate Icahn might be waiting to see just how
close he came in the battle, which took place last month at the
company's annual meeting. Texaco has said it would take between
three and four weeks for an official tally, and results are
expected soon.
   Icahn, who also heads TWA Corp., was dealt what might have been
a fatal blow in the fight by the aggressive leveraged buyout firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., which voted its 4.9 percent stake
for Texaco management.
   In conceding defeat shortly after Kohlberg's announcement, Icahn
called the company's stake the swing vote.
   But analysts are not so sure. One suggested Icahn's losing
margin may have been far wider than he has let on.
   ``If it had been a close call, he wouldn't have conceded
defeat,'' said one analyst who asked not to be quoted by name.
``His nature is being a battler, stubborn and persistent.''
   Meanwhile, Texaco is knee-deep in its own restructuring, which
includes a $3 billion payment to Pennzoil Co. to settle a lawsuit
resulting from Texaco's 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil Co. after
Pennzoil had made earlier moves to acquire Getty.
   In addition, Texaco has begun selling off up to $5 billion worth
of marginally profitable assets and says it will distribute $1.7
billion of the proceeds to shareholders.
   That, coupled with the $3-a-share annual dividend the oil
company has resumed paying already spells a decent return for Icahn.
   Wall Street insiders look upon Icahn as a ``trader type,''
someone whose long-term strategy may be vague and whose forte is
quick decisions.
   A month ago one analyst said he would ``rather go to Vegas''
than predict what Icahn might do. When asked again this week, he
said he would still rather go to the gambling resort.

<TEXT>
   Prices finished marginally lower Friday on
London's Stock Exchange as the market was stumped by U.S. trade
figures.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished the
session off 1.8 points, or 0.1 percent, at 1,861.5.
   Trading volume was a healthy 591.5 million shares, compared with
Thursday's 526.6 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. merchandise trade
deficit widened to $10.9 billion in May from a revised $10.3
billion shortfall in April. But the latest deficit came well within
the expected range.
   ``We would've known what to do had it been high or low, but when
the figures came in close to home, we didn't know what to do with
it,'' one equity salesman said.
   Glenn Davies, an equity analyst at CL-Alexanders Laing
Cruickshank Ltd., said the trade figures amounted to ``damp
fireworks'' for equities.
   ``Financial markets are beginning to prepare themselves for
another interest rate hike,'' Davies said.
   A government report that Britain's retail price index rose 0.4
percent in June compared with May and was up 4.6 percent from June
1987, heightened suspicions that British interest rates might be
headed higher.
   ``People are definitely concerned about higher interest rates,''
one analyst said.

<HEAD>Consumer Attitudes, The Best Bet Against Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Everyone is worrying about inflation, but a lot
of folks are doing something about it, and they just might have the
final say.
   Those folks are consumers, and they have been resisting price
increases for several years now and seem intent on continuing their
vigilance. This isn't an assumption; the activity shows up in
official statistics.
   The measurements that prove the case are the gross national
product implicit price deflator and the gross national product
fixed-weight price index.
   For practical purposes, the important thing to remember about
the fixed-weight price index is that it measures only changes in
prices, and these prices are of the same products month after month.
   The implicit price deflator is a bit more sophisticated,
measuring not just prices but changes in the composition of
purchases. It has been rising much more slowly than its more rigid
cousin.
   The importance of this disparity is that it indicates a
resistance to price increases by consumers. They have continued to
buy, but they have avoided items rising in price and, when
possible, switched to more stable items.
   Such behavior is enormously significant, suggesting a
fundamental change in consumer attitudes from earlier periods.
   An analysis by Wright Investors' Service contrasts this price
resistance to the attitude that prevailed during much of the 1960s
and 1970s, when consumers simply went ahead and bought. In fact,
many consumers bought more than they needed at any given time,
convinced that future prices would be even higher.
   Those were very different times. Consumers were fatalistic,
convinced that they could have little impact on pricing factors.
Why try to hold down the budget when OPEC was forcing up gasoline
and heating oil prices?
   But there was more to it than that. Many workers had broad
cost-of-living increases built into union contracts, enabling them
to offset higher prices. Industry's attitude toward wage increases
was simply to give in and then raise prices. And, for reasons not
explained logically, there existed a feeling that inflation was a
way of life that couldn't be disciplined.
   In those days, the two indicators of inflation rose in relation
to each other. It was only in the 1980s that they began to diverge,
indicating that consumers felt they could do something about
pricing, such as declining to buy.
   This relatively new sense of consumer power is especially
noticeable in automobile sales, which for several years have relied
on incentives. Take away those incentives and sales dive; replace
them and they rise again.
   It has occurred in housing sales as well, as many would-be
sellers in some of the more affluent neighborhoods have discovered
over the past few months. Houses that a year ago sold within days
of listing, now remain on the market for months, even though
mortgages have been relatively easy to obtain.
   Some retailers are complaining, but in view of today's consumer
attitude you might say they should have known better. Early this
year apparel prices rose sharply, followed quickly by sales
problems for many apparel retailers.
   The new attitude hasn't been lost on producers of services and
manufactured goods, many of whom have chosen to absorb higher costs
in order to maintain sales, rather than pass on increases and lose
customer loyalty.
   The resistance applies even to interest rates. Strange as it
sounds to some folks who couldn't get an appointment with a bank
loan officer a few years ago, many banks now advertise for
customers, especially for home loans.
   The new attitude can be found in, of all places, wage
settlements. Learning from the 1970s, when wage increases were more
than offset by price increases, workers have been seeking less,
opting instead for wage-price stability.
   It is encouraging news, this inflation fight by a lot of
ordinary folks. Together, they make an anti-inflation force as
strong as almost any other, perhaps even matching the vaunted power
of the august Federal Reserve Board.

<HEAD>Woman Brain-Damaged in Audi Crash Awarded Nearly $2.2 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   German automaker Audi says it will appeal a
jury's award of nearly $2.2 million to a brain-damaged woman
injured in a crash the jury blamed partly on an alleged defect in
her car.
   A Superior Court jury made the award Wednesday to Diane Rose,
53, who was injured when her 1981 Audi 5000S crashed into a wall as
she drove down Benedict Canyon in May 1982.
   The jury agreed with Mrs. Rose's lawyers' contention that the
accident was caused by a design defect that places the car's gas
and brake pedals too close together. Jurors found Audi 75 percent
at fault and Ms. Rose 25 percent responsible for leaving her seat
belt unbuckled.
   Audi denies there is any defect, and argued that Mrs. Rose took
a curve too fast and lost control, said spokesman Joseph Bennett at
Audi of America Inc. in Troy, Mich. The company, a division of
Volkswagen of America Inc., will appeal the decision, he said
Thursday.
   Mrs. Rose was alone in the car and there were no witnesses. The
case rested on testimony of expert witnesses from each side.
   The case is unrelated to uncontrolled acceleration problems in
automatic-transmission Audi 5000S models that prompted a 1987
recall of all 240,000 Audi 5000 models sold in this country since
1978. The cars were fitted with shift-lock devices which require a
driver to press the brake pedal before operating the automatic
transmission.
   In addition to the almost $2.2 million award to Mrs. Rose, the
jury awarded her husband, Joseph, $700,000 for his suffering.
   Mrs. Rose suffered a broken neck, brain damage and bladder
problems and has incurred medical expenses of more than $500,000,
her lawyers said.
   The jury found Volkwagen innocent of malice despite the design
defect, ruling the company did not deliberately disregard the
rights and safety of others.
   The Audi 5000 has been recalled twice before: In 1982 to raise
the height of the brake pedal so the brakes will work even if the
driver steps on the brake and accelerator pedal at the same time;
and in 1981 to anchor floor carpets so they couldn't slide up over
the accelerator and keep it from rising when the driver's foot is
removed.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Papers Show Coleco Has Negative Net Worth Of $156
Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coleco Industries Inc., which
earlier this week filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy law, said in court papers it has a negative net
worth of $156 million.
   The toy manufacturer listed assets of $384.3 million and
liabilities of $540.3 million in its petition filed late Monday in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.
   The West Hartford-based company, whose fortunes rose and fell
with the popularity of Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, said it owes
$104.3 million to secured creditors, including $94.4 million to 11
foreign and U.S. banks that loaned it money to finance daily
operations.
   It also owes $335 million to investors who bought Coleco bonds
during four separate issues over the past several years. The
company is in default on interest payments on those bonds.
   Coleco owes another $135.2 million to more than 1,200 other
creditors. Among the 20 largest creditors are six manufacturing
firms in Hong Kong owed $13.69 million. Most of the company's toys
have been made in Hong Kong.
   A Chapter 11 filing allows a company protection from its
creditors while it reorganizes and works out a plan for paying its
debts.
   The bankruptcy papers also showed that Coleco's board of
directors, aware of the company's deteriorating financial position,
first authorized the Chapter 11 filing nearly three months ago
during an April 15 meeting. The board voted last week to file on
Monday.
   Coleco has said it had to file for protection from creditors
because it could not persuade banks and debt holders to restructure
its heavy debt load. Without a restructuring, the company said, it
could not obtain financing to guarantee it could continue producing
toys.
   The papers also revealed that 35 creditors owed a total of $2.7
million have sued Coleco, including landlords seeking overdue rent
and suppliers seeking payment for business forms, heating oil, and
packaging.
   The largest case explained in the bankruptcy petition is one
filed May 19 by Concord Express Inc., a California air freight
company that is seeking payment of $1.5 million. Concord shipped
toys for the company for several months last year.

<HEAD>Eastern, Machinists Far Apart, Negotiator Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines and its combative Machinists union
are $200 million apart on terms of a new contract, according to a
company negotiator, even though the union says it has made a series
of concessions.
   Meanwhile, the steadily shrinking airline is considering
abandoning Palm Beach International Airport, according to a report
published Friday.
   The protracted negotiations between Eastern and the Machinists
have prompted the concern of Florida's congressional delegation,
which is circulating a letter that would ask the National Mediation
Board to expedite the talks.
   The letter asks the board to set ``a definite time frame for
resolution'' of the problems, according to an aide to Rep. Charles
Bennett, a Jacksonville, Fla., Democrat, but does not ask for a
30-day cooling-off period.
   Eastern's negotiators say the union's latest proposal, made
Wednesday, is ``disappointing.''
   In a letter circulated to Eastern managers, chief negotiator
Thomas Matthews claimed the Machinists' proposal would cost the
carrier $50 million a year, while the company was demanding $160
million in cost cuts.
   ``The parties are now more than $200 million apart,'' he wrote.
   Machinists negotiator Roy Anderson responded that his union has
made a steady string of concessions in an effort to win a new
contract, but Eastern has rejected them.
   The Machinists' latest two-year proposal calls for a 1.5 percent
pay raise in the first year and a 5 percent increase in the second
year, compared with the two 10 percent raises the union asked for
when the talks began.
   Anderson said the union also has agreed to more flexible work
rules and Eastern's voluntary job retraining program.
   The Palm Beach Post reported Friday that sources in the Eastern
Machinists and pilots unions, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the negotiations include stipulations by Eastern that it will
cut back and perhaps abandon operations at the Palm Beach airport
as early as this fall.
   Eastern's gates are the second-busiest at Palm Beach
International, where Delta Air Lines carries around 26 percent of
the passenger traffic and Eastern about 23 percent. Eastern
operates 14 flights a day out of the airport, and increases that
number by four or five during the winter.
   But Eastern has been retrenching for the past year, pulling out
of some markets in favor of those areas where business is stronger.
   Eastern spokesman Roger Powell said the fall flight schedule
won't be released for several weeks, but that union claims that
Eastern is facing a 20 percent to 25 percent reduction in flight
hours ``is probably pretty factual.''
   ``Surely (the fall schedule) hasn't been put to bed yet, and
it'll probably change 50 times before it is put to bed,'' Powell
said. ``As it now stands, we may see a reduction. But we have no
intentions of withdrawing from Palm Beach.''
   Eastern is a subsidiary of Houston-based Texas Air Corp., the
nation's largest airline company.

   Stock prices flattened out today after an early

   The market registered a brief favorable response to the Commerce
Department report that the merchandise trade deficit in May was
$10.9 billion, slightly below most advance estimates.
   However, analysts noted that the deficit figure for April was
revised upward to $10.3 billion from $9.9 billion.
   In other economic news, the Labor Department said wholesale
prices rose 0.4 percent in June. That too came in lower than
expected, considering the surge in prices of many farm commodities
as a result of the drought.
   Industrial production rose 0.4 percent in June, the ninth
consecutive month without a decline, the Federal Reserve said.

<HEAD>Ford Buying Land Adjacent to Avon Lake Plant, Wants EPA Expansion
Permit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. said Friday it will purchase 108
acres for possible expansion next to its Avon Lake, Ohio, truck
plant, which has been suggested as a site for a Ford-Nissan joint
venture.
   Ford applied June 2 for an Environmental Protection Agency
permit to install environmental equipment that would be required
for expansion or new construction, Ford spokeswoman Judith Muhlberg
said.
   EPA spokesman Allen Franks said the agency has conducted an
initial review of the application but is awaiting further
information about the project, which Ford is expected to submit
within a month.
   ``Our engineers are looking at Aug. 11 to get together and go
over the additional information and review the full permit
application,'' Franks said. If Ford decided to go ahead with
construction, it would have to apply for a separate permit to
operate the equipment.
   Ford officials declined to give details on the possible
expansion or new construction, saying only that making such an EPA
application is routine when either are being considered because the
federal process takes so long.
   Ford and Nissan Motor Co. Ltd, based in Japan, said earlier this
year that they had decided to move into the second stage of a study
of a possible joint venture, examining potential plant sites,
vehicles and parts sources.
   But Ford spokesman Jay Meisenhelder cautioned against connecting
the land purchase and the EPA application to the joint venture,
often reported to be a Ford-Nissan minivan.
   ``We haven't made a decision that there's even going to be a
joint venture. It's pure speculation at this point,'' Meisenhelder
said.
   Ford exercised an option on the land but had yet to close the
purchase, Meisenhelder added.
   The 1 million-square-foot, 1,500-worker Avon Lake plant builds
and paints bodies for Econoline vans and Club Wagons. The bodies
are trucked to Ford's Lorain, Ohio, assembly plant, where they are
married to chassis.
   The Lorain plant is Ford's largest in the world at 3.3 million
square feet, Muhlberg said. It also builds Ford Thunderbird and
Mercury Cougar cars.
   Ford bought the Avon Lake site from Fruehauf Corp. in 1972. It
added 60 acres to its original 170 acres in 1973. The new purchase
brings the site's total acreage to 338.

   Grain futures closed mixed while soybeans posted
strong gains Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid conflicting
weather forecasts for the drought-stricken Farm Belt.
   Forecasts for next week's weather were so mixed that ``every
time I pick up the telephone I hear a different one,'' said John
Frazier, Chicago-based grain specialist with Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   Temperatures soared above 100 degrees Friday afternoon in
Chicago and some private meteorologists were calling for dry

through Thursday.
   ``If that's true, we're going to go higher and higher next

   But Frazier said other forecasters expected cooler temperatures
and scattered showers to move into the region this weekend.
   ``We're in the hands of the weather and the weatherman,'' he
said.
   The mixed finish ended a week marked by wide swings in futures
prices. For example, soybeans for July delivery ranged during the
week from $8.56 to $10.20 a bushel.
   At the close, wheat was 3 cents lower to 5 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.85 a bushel; corn was 7{ cents
lower to 1 cent higher with July at $3.32 a bushel; oats were 1
cent to 7{ cents higher with July at $3.11{ a bushel; soybeans were
3 cents to 33{ cents higher with July at $9.95 a bushel.

<TEXT>
   Second-quarter profits at Motorola Inc.
soared 50 percent amid sharply higher sales of the company's
communications and computer products, the suburban Chicago firm
said Thursday.
   Motorola reported net income of $120 million, or 93 cents per
share, for the three months ended June 30, compared with $80
million, or 62 cents per share for the same period a year ago.
   Second-quarter sales rose 27 percent to $2.09 billion from $1.64
billion a year earlier.
   Motorola's computer and cellular telephone unit showed the
greatest improvement in the second quarter with a 43 percent
increase in sales and an 84 percent leap in orders, the company
said.
   Sales of semiconductors increased 27 percent in the quarter
while sales of two-way radio systems and paging equipment advanced
25 percent.
   ``We continue to see strong growth in our major businesses,
consistent with the trends of the last two years,'' said Chairman
Robert W. Galvin in a statement.
   He noted that Motorola products were gaining acceptance around
the world.
   For the first half of 1988, Motorola reported a 72 percent
increase in net income to $234 million, or $1.81 per share,
compared with $136 million, or $1.06 per share during the
year-earlier period.
   Sales totaled $4.04 billion in the first half, compared with
$3.19 billion a year ago.

<HEAD>British Aerospace to Proceed with Rover Takeover Despite Aid Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Aerospace PLC will go ahead with its
takeover of Rover Group PLC despite conditions the European
Commission has imposed on the deal, the government said Thursday.
   The commission on Wednesday approved the takeover on the
condition that the British government cut by $428 million the
amount of cash the government is to inject simultaneously into the
state-owned automaker.
   Trade Secretary Lord Young told the House of Lords in an
emergency statement: ``Talks with the European Commission this
morning have clarified the position in terms satisfactory to the
British Aerospace Board.''.
   Young said that the EC commissioners agreed to requests for
certain changes in the details of the deal's treatment of Rover tax
losses.
   British Aerospace had reached an agreement with the government
to acquire its 99.8-percent stake in the automaker for $254
million. At the same time, the government had said it would inject
$1.35 billion into Rover to reduce the automaker's debt.
   But the European Economic Community commission, which has the
power to block deals that it considers harmful to competition in
the 12-nation Common Market, said Wednesday it approved a smaller
aid package of $793 million.
   Because some regional aid also would be allowed, the state
subsidy effectively would be reduced to $924 million, Young said.
   British Aerospace on Wednesday had requested more time to
consider its proposed takeover in light of the conditions.

<HEAD>Producers Say Steel Imports Surged in May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steel imports surged in May to their highest
level since July 1986, domestic producers said Friday.
   An importers association, interpreting the same Commerce
Department data, said, however, that imports, excluding
semi-finished metal bound for processing on American mills, were
held within the limits of the U.S. steel quota system for the first
five months of the year.
   May imports totaled 1.94 million tons, compared with 1.53
million tons in April and 1.85 million tons in May 1987, according
to the American Iron and Steel Institute.
   Imports of all steel products, including semi-finshed ordered by
U.S. producers, totaled 9.05 million tons, up from 8.4 million tons
in the comparable 1987 period, the Washington-based AISI said.
   ``These figures reinforce the domestic industry's assertion that
the system of voluntary restraint agreements, which has been in
effect since October 1984, should be extended for at least another
five years,'' said the AISI said in a printed statement.
   The American producers said the quotas program ``has fallen
short of its objective for the almost four-year period of its
implementation.''
   Excluding semi-finished steel, January through May imports
totaled 7.8 million tons, or 17.8 percent of apparent domestic
consumption. President Reagan set a limit of 18.5 percent market
penetration when he initiated the quotas.
   American steelmakers imported about 238,000 tons out of the 1.93
million tons imported in May, the New York-based AIIS said.
   ``Steel imports have been a critical support for American steel
producers, who could contiue to meet demand as a result of imported
steel slab,'' said Erwin Klein, AIIS president and vice chairman of
the importing firm Steelinter USA of New York. ``Industry and
government should carefully review the fact that imports relieve
shortages and cut costs.''

   The dollar zoomed to recent highs against
several major currencies Friday on a continuing wave of bullish
sentiment that overwhelmed heavy selling by central banks around
the world.
   The dollar's rise began in foreign markets and was bolstered
here by the release of the most recent figures on the U.S. trade
deficit.
   So strong was the dollar's move, the currency managed to finish
at the highs of the day even after the Federal Reserve and a host
of European central banks intervened to subdue its steady climb.
Traders speculated the banks collectively may have sold as much as
$2 billion or more.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   The Commerce Department's report on the merchandise trade
deficit for May came in at $10.9 billion, supporting views that the
nation's trade imbalance is improving. While the figure was up from
a revised April deficit of $10.3 billion, it was still the second
smallest in almost three years.
   But the dollar did not wait for the release of the trade numbers
to start moving upward.
   ``It was really uncanny because ... even before the release of
the trade numbers we sensed a great deal of buying from Europe,''
said Marc Cohen, manager of corporate foreign exchange at Republic
National Bank in New York.
   Attributing the dollar's rise strictly to the trade report would
be ``underplaying the overall positive sentiment toward the dollar.
That sentiment is already built into the market,'' Cohen said.
   ``The fact that the market reacted this way to very average
trade numbers shows the underlying shift toward the dollar,'' he
added.
   Further supporting the dollar was a Labor Department report that
said the producer price index rose a modest 0.4 percent in June.
Traders said the report hinted at increased purchasing power for
the dollar.
   Intervention was heavy in both European and domestic dealings.
Traders in Europe said the Swiss, Dutch, Belgian, British, Italian
and Swedish central banks joined in when the Bundesbank began
selling dollars.
   The Fed was actively selling dollars in the domestic market, but
the currency proceeded to pierce key psychological barriers against
several currencies.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar finished at 133.40 yen, up 0.45 yen from Thursday's close.
Later in London, it was quoted at 135.35 yen. In New York the
dollar closed at 135.45 yen, up from 133.18 yen on Thursday.
   In London, the dollar gained more than 2.5 cents against the
British pound to reach its highest level since October. It cost
$1.6635 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6890 late Thursday.
   In New York, the dollar put in its best showing since October
against the pound, which cost $1.6605, far cheaper than Thursday's
$1.6875.
   The dollar finished at its highest levels against the Italian
lire and the French franc in 18 months and its highest levels
against the West German mark, the Swiss franc, and the Dutch
guilder since last summer.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday: 1.8815 West German marks, up from 1.8507; 1.5588 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5340; 6.3385 French francs, up from 6.2355;
1,391.63 Italian lire, up from 1,370.38, and 1.2101 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2095.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday: 1.8780
West German marks, up from 1.8475; 1.5555 Swiss francs, up from
1.5320; 6.3285 French francs, up from 6.2315; 2.1150 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.0815; 1,387.25 Italian lire, up from 1,367.75,
and 1.2117 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2085.
   Gold prices rose slightly in U.S. trading after declining
overseas. Republic National Bank reported a bid for gold as of 4
p.m. EDT of $440 a troy ounce, up from $438.35 on Thursday.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold finished at $440.20 a
troy ounce, up from $438.70 on Thursday.
   Gold fell in London to $438.40 a troy ounce, compared with late
Thursday's $439. In Zurich, gold closed at a bid $439, compared
with late Thursday's $441. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold dropped 48
cents an ounce to a bid of $440.05.
   Silver bullion on New York's Comex finished at $7.310 a troy
ounce, up from $7.280 on Thursday. But earlier in London the metal
fell to a late bid price of $7.30 a troy ounce, compared with late
Thursday's $7.35.

<HEAD>Grain Futures End Wild Week With A Whimper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Conflicting weather forecasts for the drought-stricken Farm Belt
brought a wild week of grain trading to a fairly subdued close
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans posted strong gains
but corn and wheat were mixed.
   On other markets, pork bellies surged the limit for daily
trading; precious metals were slightly higher; energy futures were
mixed; and stock index futures advanced.
   Forecasts for next week's weather were so mixed that ``every
time I pick up the telephone I hear a different one,'' said John
Frazier, Chicago-based grain specialist with Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   Temperatures soared above 100 degrees Friday afternoon in
Chicago and some private meteorologists were calling for dry
conditions and searing temperatures to linger in the Midwest
through Thursday.
   But other private forecasters expected cooler temperatures and
scattered showers to move into the region this weekend.
   ``We're in the hands of the weather and the weatherman,''
Frazier said.
   Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
New York, agreed: ``People are not sure we're not going to get
another rain front in the middle of next week, and the markets are
very, very nervous.''
   The drought has taken a heavy toll on the corn crop. The
Agriculture Department estimated in a report on Tuesday that 1988
corn production would fall 27 percent below last year, and the
damage mounted during the week as the stunted crop neared the end
of its pollination stage.
   Soybeans will enter a critical growing period within two weeks,
analysts said. The USDA report predicted a 14 percent drop in
soybean production, based on Tuesday's conditions.
   Friday's mixed close ended a week marked by wide swings in
prices. Soybeans for July delivery ranged during the week from
$8.56 to $10.20 a bushel and July corn ranged from $2.86 to $3.50 a
bushel.
   Heavy profit-taking dragged soybeans down to a 5-week low on
Monday. But the USDA crop report renewed fears of heavy yield
losses, and traders responded by bidding prices back up to levels
close to the previous week's highs.
   Wheat settled 4 cents lower to 5 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in July at $3.84 a bushel; corn was 7 cents lower to
1} cents higher with July at $3.33{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to
7{ cents higher with July at $3.11{ a bushel; soybeans were 7{
cents to 32 cents higher with July at $9.94{ a bushel.
   Frozen pork belly futures continued their recovery from recent
lows near 32 cents a pound amid higher cash prices and retail
featuring of bacon, analysts said.
   Friday's gain of 2 cents a pound _ the maximum allowed _ on
contracts for July and August delivery marked the fourth straight
day of the pork belly rally on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   A decline in hog slaughter numbers lent additional support to
the belly and hog futures, said Dale Durchholz, an analyst with
AgriVisor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.
   Most cattle futures advanced in pre-weekend position-squaring,
analysts said.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .85 cent higher with August
at 64.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .80 cent
higher with August at 74.75 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent lower
to .75 cent higher with July at 46.27 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .68 cent to 2 cents higher with July at 37.30 cents a
pound.
   The soaring dollar kept a lid on the precious metals market
despite the possibility that Peruvian silver miners will launch a
nationwide strike on Monday.
   The dollar soared against several currencies in reaction to the
government's report of a $10.9 billion merchandise trade deficit in
May.
   ``This was a fantastically strong dollar,'' said Bette
Raptopoulos, precious metals analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York. ``It just surged and put pressure on
outside markets.''
   Gold settled $1 to $1.40 higher with August at $441.30 a troy
ounce; silver was 3 cents higher across the board with July at
$7.31 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures finished mixed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in light pre-weekend trading that brokers attributed
largely to internal market influences.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 16 cents lower to 10 cents
higher with August at $14.86 a barrel; heating oil was .21 cent to
.45 cent higher with August at 41.12 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .91 cent lower to .01 cent higher with August at 49.73
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled 1.35 points higher at 272.80.

<HEAD>Congressman Battles British Takeover of Insurance Company</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto AT-1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Texas lawmaker on Friday charged that British
BAT Industries PLC's $4.5 billion bid for Farmers Insurance Group
threatens jobs and anti-smoking efforts and urged state regulators
to reject the move.
   ``I have serious doubts about whether we should permit ...
hostile takeovers of American companies by foreign firms, which are
not motivated by a long-term commitment to the maintenance of
American jobs or the well-being of the American people,'' said U.S.
Rep. John Bryant, a Dallas Democrat.
   The bid must be approved by nine states in which the insurance
company operates. Oregon and California have rejected the bid. But
Bryant said litigation is planned in California.
   A spokesman for BAT Industries' U.S. subsidiary, the Louisville,
Ky.-based Batus Inc., could not be reached for comment.
   But the company said in a statement that it has extended to Aug.
11 the deadline of its tender offer to purchase all of Farmers'
outstanding common shares for $63 each.
   BAT is the world's largest tobacco company; Farmers, based in
Los Angeles, is a leading U.S. insurance company.
   Hostile takeovers ``have consumed larger and larger shares of
American capital and productive capacity,'' Bryant said, calling
takeovers by foreign-owned companies particularly worrisome.
   Farmers has 1,940 Texas employees, 2,000 agents and more than
1.26 million policy holders in the state. Bryant said the takeover
would ``jeopardize the jobs of employees and the security of
policyholders in Texas,'' many of whom have taken advantage of
premium discounts for non-smokers.
   BAT ``has indicated it does not approve of and would not
continue Farmers' health-oriented, money-saving, anti-smoking
efforts,'' Bryant said.
   Besides offering discounts to non-smokers, the insurance company
produces anti-smoking literature.

   Stock prices chalked up a moderate gain Friday
in a restrained response to what most analysts described as
favorable news on international trade.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 15.83 to 2,129.45,
finishing the week with a net gain of 23.30.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
787 up, 632 down and 532 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 199.71 million
shares, up from 172.41 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 225.86 million shares.
   The market registered a slight favorable response to the
Commerce Department report that the merchandise trade deficit in
May stood at $10.9 billion, a bit below most advance estimates.
   The dollar gave the news a particularly warm reception, posting
strong gains against leading foreign currencies.
   However, analysts also noted that the deficit figure for April
was revised upward to $10.3 billion from $9.9 billion.
   In other economic news, the Labor Department said wholesale
prices rose 0.4 percent in June. That too came in lower than
expected, considering the surge in prices of many farm commodities
as a result of the drought.
   Industrial production rose 0.4 percent in June, for the ninth
consecutive month without a decline, the Federal Reserve said.
   International Business Machines gained } to 125{. IBM's
second-quarter earnings came in about as expected, up 12.7 percent
excluding a special restructuring charge.
   Elsewhere among the blue chips, Exxon rose 1 to 46|; American
Telephone & Telegraph ] to 26|; General Motors 1[ to 79{; General
Electric { to 43}, and Alcoa 1| to 54|.
   Interco jumped 5{ to 54]. Harvey Saligman, the company's chief
executive, said he plans to recommend a major restructuring.
   Catalyst Energy rose | to 9}. In a bidding contest for the
company, Karibu Corp. raised its offer from $10.50 a share to
$10.90.
   Rollins Environmental fell 1 to 18\. The company reported that
earnings for the quarter ended June 30 rose to 20 cents a share
from 16 cents in the comparable period a year earlier, but the
figure evidently fell short of investors' expectations.
   Church's Fried Chicken, which cut its quarterly dividend from
11.5 cents a share to 5 cents a share, dropped ] to 6.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $11.25 billion, or .42
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .89 to 153.65.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 2.21 to 314.38, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.79 at 272.05.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped .08 to 394.59. At the American Stock Exchange, the market

<HEAD>IBM Earnings Fall 18.1 Percent After Restructuring Charge</HEAD>

   International Business Machines Corp. said
Friday its second-quarter profit fell 18.1 percent, but would have
risen 12.7 percent if not for the expense of a streamlining plan.
   Investors, apparently focusing on evidence that IBM was
controlling costs better, bid the stock up 75 cents to $125.50 a
share in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   ``It's a solid report,'' said Steven Cohen, an analyst for
Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn. ``The growth in expenses is
slowing without these special charges.''
   Last month, IBM announced a $600 million plan to consolidate
manufacturing and headquarters operations that it said would
probably lead to the resignation or retirement of 3,000 to 4,000
employees.
   While the company has succeeded in cutting costs, it has had
less luck drumming up more business. Revenue rose 6.3 percent in
the second quarter after an unusual blip of 10 percent growth in
the first quarter.
   ``Our business continues to improve as a result of our actions
to be more competitive, and customer response to our recent product
announcements has been positive,'' John F. Akers, IBM's chairman
and chief executive, said in a statement.
   IBM said its profit fell to $964 million, or $1.63 a share, from
$1.18 billion, or $1.95 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to
$13.6 billion from $12.8 billion a year earlier.
   For the first six months of the fiscal year, IBM said its profit
rose 12.7 percent to $2.21 billion, or $3.73 a share, from $1.96
billion, or $3.25 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 8 percent
to $25.3 billion from $23.5 billion.
   The cost of the restructuring, which IBM says will eventually
benefit its profits, was charged to the second quarter and reduced
earnings for the period by $364 million, or 61 cents a share.
   Earnings for the first quarter of 1988 were restated to reflect
a change in accounting standards for deferred taxes. That change
added 57 cents a share to first-quarter earnings, largely
offsetting the negative impact of the restructuring charge on
first-half results.
   Aside from the special charge, IBM held the growth in costs and
expenses to 5.8 percent in the second quarter, less than revenue
growth, Cohen said.
   He predicted revenue would grow strongly next year with new
products such as the F series of 3090 mainframe computers, the new
Application System-400 midrange models, and improved operating
software for its new personal computer line.
   ``It's been a tough five years for the company, but it looks
like the pieces have fallen in place for a record 1989,'' he said.
   Joseph Battipaglia, an analyst for Gruntal & Co., is also
predicting IBM's 1989 earnings per share will exceed the record of
$10.77 set in 1984. But he said revenue growth is likely to remain
subdued.
   ``I think that is a situation that may well be with them until
the next significant leap in price and performance in the industry,
and we really haven't had any,'' he said.
   Akers, in his written statement, said, ``Our ongoing drive for
efficiency and competitiveness and our continuing commitment to
customer partnerships give us confidence for the future.''

<HEAD>Bond Prices Edge Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices edged higher in moderate trading
Friday as investors reacted to a surge in the dollar following the
government's report that the U.S. trade deficit for May had not
worsened considerably.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose about \ point, or
about $2.50 for every $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves
inversely to its price, slipped to 9.14 percent from 9.17 percent
late Thursday.
   Long bond prices made the biggest gains, but trading in those
securities was light, said William Sullivan Jr., director of money
market research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The bond market had been sluggish during the week in
anticipation of three key economic reports _ on the trade deficit,
producer prices and industrial production, all released Friday
morning.
   But all of the reports were about as expected, and as a result
had little impact on bond prices, analysts said. They said bond
prices got a push, however, from the dollar's rise in foreign
exchange markets.
   ``There were really no jolts or surprises as far as the economic
data,'' Sullivan said. ``But the international markets interpreted
the trade figures very bullishly and the dollar moved up smartly.
The dollar's firmer trend helped support higher bond prices.''
   The Commerce Department reported the deficit widened to $10.9
billion in May, from a revised April figure of $10.3 billion.
   Analysts had expected the trade gap would expand to the $11
billion area. The $10.9 billion imbalance was the second lowest in
almost three years.
   ``The continued improved trend in the trade figures and strength
in the dollar as a result of them have temporarily offset fears of
higher short-term interest rates,'' said Marshall B. Front, an
economist at the Chicago investment and mutual-fund management firm
of Stein Roe & Farnham.
   A sharp widening of the trade gap in the past has hurt the
dollar and led to declines in bond prices. Bond investors fear a
lower dollar will lead to inflation, credit-tightening by the
Federal Reserve and surging interest rates.
   A moderate 0.4 percent rise for June in the government's
Producer Price Index also boosted investor confidence, Front said.
   ``Bond prices were up modestly reflecting a sense of relief that
the trade figures and the Producer Price Index didn't provide any
important shocks and didn't reveal any negatives,'' he said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues rose about 1-16 point, intermediate maturities
rose by between [ point to 7-32 point and 20-year issues were up
5-32 point, according to the financial information service Telerate
Inc.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, was up 1.61 to 1,138.97.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 0.65 to 281.88.
   Among tax-exempt municipal bonds, general obligations were
unchanged while dollar bonds were up \ point. Trading was moderate.
   Three-month Treasury bills were down 1 basis point to a
discounted rate of 6.71 percent, for a yield of 6.91 percent.
Six-month bills rose 4 basis points to a discounted rate of 7.05
percent to yield 7.40 percent and one-year bills were unchanged at
7.26 percent to yield 7.77 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discounted rate is the interest rate the market uses to price bills.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 7 13-16 percent, up from 7} percent late
Thursday.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gannett Co. Inc. said Thursday that earnings
advanced 9 percent in the second quarter, thanks in part to a
favorable change in the company's tax rate.
   Net income was $97.5 million compared to $89.7 million for the
same period a year ago. Earnings per share increased to 60 cents
from 56 cents for the same quarter the year before.
   Operating revenues advanced 7 percent to $846.9 million,
compared to $789.8 million.
   For the first half of 1988, net income increased 21 percent to
$171.5 million. Operating revenues gained 8 percent to $1.6 billion.
   John J. Curley, president and chief executive officer, said,
``Most Gannett units achieved higher earnings, despite an uncertain
economic environment which affected advertising volume.
   ``Newspaper operations reported increased earnings in the
quarter and the trend in outdoor advertising improved. Broadcasting
earnings were impacted by weak national sales and the company's
continuing investment in GTG entertainment.''
   Gannett is a nationwide news and information company that
publishes 89 daily newspapers, including USA Today, 35 non-daily
newspapers and USA Weekend, a newspaper magazine.
   The company said ad revenues at USA Today advanced 6 percent as
a result of a rate adjustment. Paid advertising pages for the
newspaper declined slightly in the quarter.
   It operates 10 television stations, 16 radio stations, Gannett
News Service and the largest outdoor advertising company in North
America.

<HEAD>Coca-Cola's Profit Up 13.8 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Co. reported Thursday that its profit
rose 13.8 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, led by
strong sales in Europe and the Pacific that were helped by the
weaker dollar.
   The beverage maker and distributor said net income increased to
$303 million, or 82 cents a share, from $266.4 million, or 70 cents
a share, in the second quarter of 1987.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 9.9 percent, to $2.3 billion from
$2.1 billion a year earlier.
   For the first six months of the year, Coca-Cola's profit jumped
13.7 percent, to $513.6 million, or $1.39 a share, from $451.8
million, or $1.19 a share, in the first half of 1987.
   Revenue for the half expanded 14.5 percent, to $4.2 billion from
$3.6 billion.
   ``The excellent second-quarter results reaffirm our expectation
that 1988 will be another year of strong volume and solid,
double-digit earnings growth for our company, coming on top of a
record 1987,'' Roberto C. Goizueta, chairman and chief executive
officer, said in a press statement.
   ``Our core soft drink business has never been on more solid
ground by any measure,'' he said. ``We expect the next six months
to benefit from the strong momentum with which our business is
moving into the second half of this year.''
   The company said its worldwide soft drink unit sales increased 5
percent in the latest quarter and 7 percent in the first six months.
   Outside the United States, second-quarter soft drink volume grew
an average 5 percent, including advances of 8 percent in Europe and
6 percent in the Pacific. The dollar's decline against key foreign
currencies boosted Coke sales by making the product cheaper
overseas, the company said.
   U.S. sales in the quarter grew 6 percent, including a 9 percent
rise in shipments of Coca-Cola Classic.

<HEAD>Oregon Official Rejects Proposed Farmers Insurance Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oregon's insurance commissioner on Thursday
rejected Batus Inc.'s attempted hostile takeover of the Oregon unit
of Farmers Insurance Co.
   Commissioner Ted Kulongoski concluded that the proposed buyout
by Batus, the U.S. arm of British conglomerate BAT Industries PLC,
Inc. would affect Farmers' policyholders adversely and be harmful
to free competition in the Oregon insurance trade.
   Kulongoski also cited the intention of Batus, which owns a major
tobacco company, to restrict the non-smoker policies sold by
Farmers. The commissioner said that also would be bad for
competition.
   Kulongoski's order can be appealed to the courts.
   Batus has offered about $4.5 billion to acquire Los
Angeles-based Farmers. Farmers directors have rejected the
proposal, which would require approval of insurance regulators in
nine states where Farmers has units.
   California's insurance commissioner also has rejected the
proposal, and Arizona has approved it.
   The commissioner's ruling stated the proposed acquisition
``subjects policyholders and shareholders to substantial risks
while providing no benefit that Farmers does not already enjoy.''
   He also said the continued denials by BAT and Batus ``of the
known adverse health effects of tobacco smoking, and its stated
intentions of precluding Farmers from referring to such health
effects in its marketing literature, do not promote the interest of
the insurance-buying public.''
   Batus owns Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. along with
department store concerns including Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall
Field.
   Kulongoski said the proposed purchase would increase risks to
Farmers' policyholders because of potential judgments over
liability lawsuits involving tobacco products.
   ``In addition,'' Kulongoski said, ``there is evidence that the
proposed financing of the acquisition is unworkable.''
   And he said the takeover would be ``detrimental to free
competition in the Oregon insurance marketplace.''

<HEAD>Aerospace Company Says 6 Pct. Profit Increase Due to Tax Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALABASAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp. reported a 6 percent
profit second quarter profit increase on Thursday, but the
aerospace company attributed the gain largely to lower taxes.
   Lockheed earned $106 million, or $1.77 per share, in the second
quarter, up from $100 million, or $1.51 per share, in the same
period of 1987.
   Sales during the quarter ended June 26 fell to $2.7 billion from
$2.9 billion the year before.
   The per-share earnings figures for the two years are not
comparable because the company has bought back some 7 million
shares of its stock since the October 1987 stock market crash.
   Operating profit declined in the second quarter, to $163 million
from $195 million, partly because Lockheed's contract to build the
C-5B military transport plane is nearing an end, the company said.
Additionally, new Pentagon policies requiring contractors to pay a
larger share of the cost of development contracts has reduced
operating profit, the company said.
   Net income rose primarily because of lower tax rates, said
Lawrence Kitchen, chairman and chief executive.
   In the first half of 1988, Lockheed reported a profit of $220
million on sales of $5.3 billion, up from profit of $186 million on
sales of $5.4 billion in the same period of 1987.
