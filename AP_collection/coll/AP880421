   Hostages freed in Algiers from a hijacked Kuwait
Airways jet came home Thursday to a tumultuous reception by
thousands of people after being released by nine Shiite Moslem
gunmen, who slipped away.
   Western diplomatic sources said they had clear evidence the
hijackers had reached Beirut after Algerian officials allowed them
to go free, ending the 15-day siege.
   In its Friday editions, The New York Times quoted unnamed Arab
officials as saying the hijackers had been flown on a private
Algerian jet to Damascus, Syria and were believed to have then
traveled over land to Beirut.
   The emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, and Crown
Prince Sheik Saad Abdullah Al-Sabah led a group of government
officials and relatives who were at the Kuwait airport to meet the
former captives.
   Flocks of doves soared over the airport as the Kuwait Airways
Boeing 707 carrying the 22 passengers and seven crew members
touched down Thursday night after a six-hour flight from Algiers.
   Two other hostages released early Wednesday were Saudi Arabian
citizens and were flown home in a private executive jet.
   Bedouin men danced and clapped at the Kuwaiti airport, and
children waved flags and sang, ``God bless our father, Jaber,''
referring to the emir.
   The Kuwaiti passengers traveled by motorcade to the city center.
Thousands of people lining the route, tossing roses and confetti.
   Hundreds of others followed in cars and limousines, honking
their horns and singing, ``We sacrifice blood and souls for you, O
Kuwait.''
   The gunmen, who killed two hostages while the hijacked jumbo jet
was in Cyprus last week, disappeared before dawn Wednesday after
abandoning their attempt to force Kuwait to release 17 pro-Iranian
terrorists jailed for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in
Kuwait in 1983. Both slain captives were Kuwaitis.
   Kuwait refused any concessions to the hijackers but Algeria
apparently promised them passage to a country of their choice if
they freed the hostages unharmed.
   Algeria, criticized by the United States and other Western
governments, has refused to acknowledge making a deal with the
hijackers. There was no reference to them Thursday in any of the
North African country's state-controlled media.
   Several of the returning Kuwaiti passengers accused Iran of
complicity in the hijacking, saying one gunman was replaced by two
others when the craft landed in Iran.
   ``One of the two was obviously a military pilot. He was ordering
other gunmen around and telling them lots of things about the
aircraft and supervising the wiring of explosives to most parts of
the plane,'' said passenger Khaled Nasser Al-Zaferi.
   In Algiers, a brief farewell was held at the Houari Boumedienne
Airport before the former hostages were flown to Kuwait.
   The former captives included three cousins of Sabah Jaber Sabah,
ruler of the sheikdom.
   Compared with their tense, trembling appearance when they had
emerged from the hijacked Boeing 747, the former captives looked
rested and relaxed.
   Anware Sabah, second cousin of the emir, said the hijackers
treated her and her sister ``with deference and without
brutality.'' Their brother, Fadel Khaled Sabah, said he was
``psychologically fatigued'' when he made a statement by radio to
the control tower asking that the gunmen's demands be met.
   After their release, the hostages spent 30 hours at the Algiers
military hospital being examined.
   A Kuwaiti doctor said all were in good physical condition but
the psychological effects of the long, terrifying confinement may
be felt for weeks or months.
   Algerian authorities would not permit journalists to inspect the
hijacked plane, which awaited a relief crew to return it to Kuwait.
One Kuwait Airways official said the hijackers deliberately damaged
the radio equipment before leaving.
   A member of the airport cleanup crew said trash was strewn
through the aircraft, ropes had been used to divide the seating
area and a large world map had been pinned to the wall of the
forward cabin. He said the stench of rotting fruit filled the plane.
   Other Arab countries, including Kuwait, praised Algeria for
achieving freedom for the hostages without additional violence.
   Algerian media called it a ``victory'' but Secretary of State
George P. Shultz, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and
other Western leaders criticized Algeria for allowing the hijackers
to get away.
   ``The United States will not rest until the terrorists, the
murderers, the hijackers are brought to justice,'' said State
Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley in Washington.
   She declined to say what steps might be taken but said officials
are checking to see whether laws apply that allow charges against
hijackers when a U.S. citizen is involved. At least one passenger
carried an American passport.
   An international convention calls for sanctions against any
country allowing hijackers to escape unpunished, including an end
to direct air service to the offending nation. Algeria is not a
signatory.
   An Soviet-built Antonov transport of the Algerian air force was
seen taking off before dawn Wednesday, shortly before the hostages
left the hijacked plane. It was widely assumed the hijackers were
aboard the Antonov, which can land on a grassy field.

   Embattled Attorney General Edwin Meese III was
summoned to a private meeting with President Reagan at the White
House on Wednesday after Reagan met with two Justice Department
officials who resigned in protest over Meese's continued tenure, a
department source said Thursday night.
   The source, who declined to be identified, said Deputy Attorney
General Arnold Burns and former Assistant Attorney General William
Weld, who headed the department's criminal division, met at the
White House with Reagan and Vice President George Bush and some
White House staff members.
   During that 45-minute meeting, Burns told the president, Bush,
White House chief of staff Howard Baker and White House counsel
A.B. Culvahouse that ``Meese's behavior was hurting the Department
of Justice,'' another administration source said.
   Weld, meanwhile, ``laid out the facts'' in a hypothetical
indictment he said he would have brought against Meese if he were
the special prosecutor investigating the attorney general.
   Meese has been under investigation for nearly a year by
independent counsel James McKay, who is looking into a handful of
incidents to see if Meese violated conflict-of-interest or other
federal laws.
   It was not immediately known what occurred during Meese's
meeting at the White House, which immediately followed the
Burns-Weld meeting, but Meese said in an interview Thursday with
USA Today that the president has continued to express his ``total
support ... and total confidence.''
   During the earlier White House meeting with the departing
Justice Department officials, Burns ``laid out the reasons why
Meese should leave,'' said the source, who also spoke on condition
of anonymity. He added that Burns never specifically suggested that
Meese should resign.
   Burns told Reagan that Meese had violated the standards of
ethical conduct for executive branch employees spelled out in a
1965 executive order.
   Those standards, among other things, say that employees should
avoid any action which could create the appearance of using public
office for private gain, giving preferential treatment to any
organization or person and making a government decision outside
official channels.
   Burns specifically mentioned longtime Meese friend E. Robert
Wallach, who is under indictment in the Wedtech scandal, as having
taken advantage of his relationship with the attorney general to
promote his own business interests.
   Burns, while not using these specific words, in effect told
Reagan that ``Wallach was selling the office of the attorney
general,'' said the source.
   Another administration source familiar with the Wednesday
meetings was asked about the outcome. ``As you can see, there was
no change,'' he responded.
   A Justice Department spokesman, Dean St. Dennis, had no
immediate comment.
   Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman, said late Thursday that
he was unfamiliar with either of the meetings Wednesday.
   ``I have no idea what you're talking about,'' he said. ``I can't
confirm or deny.''
   He noted, however, that White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said this week that Reagan has ``full confidence'' in Meese.
   Burns and Weld have not discussed publicly their reasons for
submitting their resignations March 29, but sources close to them
have said they felt that Meese's continued tenure in the department
while he is under investigation by an independent counsel was
hampering department operations.
   During the White House meeting, Weld told Reagan that if he were
the special prosecutor in the criminal investigation of Meese, he
would seek an indictment of the attorney general, said the
administration source.
   Weld had made similar comments to Meese on March 29 when Weld
and Burns announced to the attorney general that they were
resigning.
   According to the source, Weld in the meeting with the president
``laid out the facts'' in a hypothetical indictment.
   ``The president was very attentive, listened to the story, got
up and Meese came in'' after Burns and Weld left, said the
administration source.
   In the past, said several sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, Weld has told Justice Department associates that he
feels a number of felony charges could be lodged against Meese
based on the factual evidence known to date in the nearly year-long
probe of Meese. These include conspiracy counts involving the
acceptance of illegal gratuities, a violation of Ethics in
Government Act provisions spelling out conflicts of interest and a
violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act barring bribes to
foreign officials.
   One knowledgeable source said that Meese had been summoned to
the White House and met privately with Reagan and possibly Bush
after Weld had met with Meese on the day he resigned.
   The source was unable to provide any details of that
conversation.
   McKay is looking into Meese's ties to the scandal-plagued
Wedtech Corp. and a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project.
   McKay is also known to be looking into Mrs. Meese's
$40,000-a-year job with the Multiple Sclerosis Society. Mrs.
Meese's salary is underwritten by The Bender Foundation, a
tax-exempt philanthropy run by a Washington real estate family.
   The Associated Press reported last week that a partnership
headed by Howard M. Bender, the foundation's vice president, owned
a building for which the government signed a $50 million lease for
a Justice Department office building in May 1987. Thirteen days
after signing the lease, the Bender partnership sold the building
for a $22.6 million profit.
   Meese has denied any wrongdoing and said he didn't have anything
to do with the lease.
   The attorney general said Thursday that he meets the highest
ethical standards expected of public officials and knows of no
factor ``right now that would cause me to resign.''
   In the interview published in Friday's editions of USA Today,
Meese said the president has continued to express his ``total
support ... and total confidence.''
   However, he did not rule out resigning before Reagan's term ends.
   ``I've never set a particular limit of how long I would stay or
how long I wouldn't stay. A lot would depend upon my own
post-federal service employment situation and so on,'' he said.

Operation PUSH.

   ``I like everything you said,'' the old man told
Jesse Jackson on the campaign trail, ``but ... won't the
Republicans be able to clobber you and the Democratic Party on the
basis of your lack of governmental experience?''
   Jackson looked around the hall. He was in a New York suburb,
addressing senior citizens who had just listened to a litany of
legislative accomplishments from Sen. Albert Gore Jr., one of his
rivals for the presidential nomination.
   Jackson was ready for this often asked question. In the first
place, he said, the Reagan-Bush administration has experience and
look what they've done _ a record trade deficit, a record debt, a
mess in Central America and the Middle East and ``the most sleaze
and corruption in ... American history.''
   Then he launched into his own record of leadership in civil
rights and labor strife.
   ``Of those of us who are running _ if you were about to lose
your farm, had to face the banker _ which one would you choose to
argue your case? ... If you needed a scholarship for your child who
would you want to argue your case? If you had a relative in a
foreign jail, who would you send to bring your relative back home?''
   Now the punchline _ ``Some office holders are not leaders and
some leaders are not office holders ... I am a leader.''
   Jackson has never been elected to office or run a business, but
he has headed a nationwide organization, the Chicago-based
Operation PUSH _ People United to Serve Humanity _ and its
education-oriented affiliate, PUSH for Excellence, or PUSH-Excel.
His handling of things at PUSH has come under scrutiny for signs of
how he might run the government.
   Over the years, Jackson has used PUSH to keep himself in the
spotlight with his crowd-stirring oratory, media-wise instincts and
ability to capitalize on the latest public issues.
   Although he stepped down as head of PUSH when he ran for
president in 1984, he often returns to lead its Saturday morning
meetings.
   Jackson was the architect of PUSH's campaign to pressure
corporations to expand hiring and business opportunities for
minorities.
   However, Jackson left PUSH with a record of improper use of
government money, high staff turnover and dwindling revenues.
   His supporters point to PUSH's achievements in strengthening
black economic power as examples of Jackson's ability and say he
was a genius at keeping the organization afloat despite a chronic
cash shortage.
   They dismiss administrative problems as mstakes made by
well-meaning volunteers and low-paid staff members.
   ``I think he managed incredibly well given the resources he had.
All civil rights organizations have always operated at a deficit,''
said Sam Tidmore, a founding member of PUSH's board.
   Jackson's critics maintain that PUSH operated like a personality
cult, built around Jackson, rather than a well-managed organization.
   ``Jesse just doesn't have the ability to keep things together,''
said the Rev. Hosea Williams, a longtime civil rights activist and
Jackson critic. ``When it comes to building and motivating people,
Jesse is a genius. But he can't sustain an effort and that is
evidenced by PUSH.''
   In the past decade, PUSH has been beset by troubles:
   _PUSH for Excellence either misspent or failed to account for
$1.2 million out of an estimated $6.6 million in federal grants
from the departments of Labor, Education, Commerce and Health and
Human Services, federal auditors found. The government still is
trying to collect the money without having to take PUSH to court.
   _The Commerce Department concluded in a 1980 audit that
PUSH-Excel's ``accounting system and internal controls are not
adequate to safeguard its assets,'' or ensure reliable accounting
and operating efficiency.
   _PUSH-Excel and Operation PUSH were hit in the 1970s and early
1980s with more than a dozen lawsuits by businesses seeking payment
of overdue bills for such things as telephone service, printing and
paper supplies.
   _In Jackson's 1984 campaign it was revealed the PUSH
organizations had received a $10,000 donation from Libya and
$200,000 from the League of Arab States. The contributions were
made after Jackson toured the Middle East in 1979 and was
photographed embracing Yasser Arafat, head of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League's ambassador to the United
Nations, said recently that the contribution was made because of
``a growing affinity between the Arab-American and black
communities'' at that time.
   Maksoud said the Arab League has not donated any money since
then to the PUSH network.

   A London jewelry dealer was identified as the
person who paid $9.13 million for the largest diamond ever to be
sold at auction, a Sotheby's spokeswoman said.
   Laurence Graff purchased the 85.91-carat, pear-shaped diamond by
telephone during Tuesday's auction, spokeswoman Jennifer Brown said
Wednesday.
   The sale set a record for any gem sold at auction, she said.
   The diamond, which was perfectly cut and flawless, was part of
an auction that brought $36 million, a record for a jewelry sale in
the United States.
   The auction included gems belonging to the late Clare Boothe
Luce, a former congresswoman and ambassador to Italy.
   Also Wednesday, Christie's announced the sale of a 52.59 carat
diamond ring for $7.8 million, the highest price ever paid per
carat at auction, said spokeswoman Lily Zimmerman.
   She said $132,000 was paid per carat by a private Saudi Arabian
collector bidding by telephone.

<HEAD>CHICAGO: PUSH network.</HEAD>

   On the other side of the ledger, PUSH improved business
opportunities for blacks by persuading corporations to sign
``covenants'' promising jobs and franchises to minorities _ often
after PUSH threatened or carried out boycotts of a company's
product.
   From the start, on Christmas 1971, Jackson vowed the group would
``picket, vote and if necessary engage in civil disobedience'' to
achieve its goals.
   Williams, now a member of the Atlanta City Council, recalled
Jackson had quit as head of a similar group, Operation Breadbasket,
an arm of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, after
clashing with SCLC leaders over expenditures and Jackson's
independent streak.
   Jackson built PUSH into a network with chapters in 32 cities,
taking in $16.8 million from 1975 to 1986, the last year for which
state financial records were filed.
   He also used the PUSH platform to take on the administrations of
several presidents and the city hierarchy of Chicago on a range of
issues, from U.S. policy in Central America to contracts for
minority-owned businesses.
   PUSH's Saturday meetings are part of Chicago's political
landscape, mixing the gospel flavor of a Southern church revival
with Jackson's stirring speeches on the day's hot issues.
   From the PUSH pulpit, Jackson pressured companies, such as
Burger King and Coca-Cola, to sign minority opportunity compacts.
   ``Jesse was instrumental in making a lot of opportunities
available _ by that I mean distributorships, getting blacks placed
in jobs in chain stores,'' said Dempsey Travis, a Chicago
businessman and Jackson supporter.
   PUSH officials have long been secretive about the group's
sources of money, other than to say it is supported by individual
memberships that now cost $20 a person and donations from
businesses.
   Some of the corporations that signed covenants with PUSH also
contributed money to help sponsor its annual convention or other
activities. Coors Brewery, for example, gave $20,000 last year to a
major PUSH scholarship fund-raising event in Chicago.
   In 1977, Jackson broadened PUSH's mission by starting PUSH-Excel
to get inner-city youths to study harder. He spoke in packed school
gymnasiums nationwide, with students joining in his trademark
chant: ``I am ... somebody!''
   After Jackson fired up the students, PUSH-Excel worked with
local school officials to set up special clubs and programs to help
keep the youths motivated.
   But federal auditors later contended that government money
received from 1979 to 1982 went for such layouts as $211 for music
and flowers for a 1979 press party in Los Angeles; ``$650 for
Christmas cards purchased for a related organization''; $28 for
funeral flowers, and $15 for a parking ticket.
   The government has referred PUSH-Excel's $1.2 million debt to
the Justice Department for collection.
   ``As of now, we haven't been able to resolve it,'' said Justice
spokesman Amy Brown.
   PUSH-Excel dramatized Jackson's strengths, and weaknesses, said
Ernest House, an education professor who has just finished writing
a book about Jackson and the student-motivation program.
   ``Jesse had a lot of very good ideas. He has trouble carrying
them through _ that has been his problem,'' said House, who is
director of the policy studies laboratory at the University of
Colorado at Boulder.
   ``They went through three or four directors, one right after the
other, and this was part of his difficulty in administering the
program,'' House said.
   By 1986, PUSH-Excel's revenues, which peaked at $2.6 million in
1980, had dropped to $209,071 and the group ended the year with a
$1.5 million debt, including the money owed to the government.
   Operation PUSH wasn't much better off. It started 1986 with a
$339,056 deficit, but took in enough money to reduce the debt to
$84,914 by the end of the year, according to its annual report
filed with the state.
   The Rev. Willie Barrow, PUSH's national executive director, did
not return repeated telephone calls asking for information about
the organization's current financial status.
   Frank Watkins, Jackson's longtime aide and spokesman, said he
understood the group had succeeded this year in nearly erasing its
deficit.
   Although Jackson was PUSH's driving force, his supporters say he
shouldn't be blamed for organizational problems in areas delegated
to subordinates. Jackson himself has said he didn't get involved in
mechanical details.
   ``If there was anything sloppy about Jesse's management, it was
that he could not afford paid, competent people to deal with the
various functions of accounting and management of government
programs,'' said Bishop H.H. Bookins, a leader in the African
Methodist Episcopal church and a Jackson supporter.
   ``Jesse's main thrust was at raising funds to keep the
organization afloat. So it was impossible for him to be a hands-on
manager of things,'' he said.
   Jackson supporters point to the success of his 1988 presidential
campaign as evidence he can recruit able people to assist him.
   Leon Davis, who worked as PUSH's national executive director in
1972, said he sees a different Jackson today.
   ``From the time I worked with Jesse, it seems to me he has grown
tremendously and his campaign points out one thing _ he has
delegated authority. ''

   A state Senate panel agreed that swing
is the thing.
   Sen. Quentin Kopp persuaded the Senate Rules Committee on
Wednesday to approve a bill that would designate the West Coast
Swing Dance as the official state dance.
   Kopp said the dance, also known as swing, whip, or jitterbug, is
the only dance native to the state of California that has survived.
   It originated in the early 1930s, he said, adding that devotees
of the art come from every ethnic, religious, racial or economic
background.
   The committee's 4-0 vote sent swing over its first legislative
hurdle. It faces further votes in the Senate and Assembly before it
would go to the governor for his signature.
   The Senate several years ago rejected a bill that would have
made the square dance the official state dance.

<TEXT>
   The Senate is likely to join the House in
approving major changes in the nation's welfare system, despite the
near certainty that a presidential veto lies at the end of the long
road to congressional consensus.
   The 25-year drive to overhaul welfare took a significant step
forward Wednesday when the Senate Finance Committee voted 17-3 to
send a comprehensive reform measure to the floor.
   The five-year, $2.8 billion ``Family Security Act'' reflects a
hard-won bipartisan consensus that welfare parents should work to
support their children, that the goverment should help make this
possible and that government aid should be a last resort.
   The bill was shaped during months of negotiations and had
garnered 56 co-sponsors by the time the committee acted. Most of
the Republicans on the Finance Committee, including Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, voted in favor of it.
   ``For all the troubles, in the end, we agree,'' said Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., chief sponsor and architect of the plan.
``We learned to talk to each other and listen and learn.''
   While a majority of Senate Democrats and Republicans may have
reached a fragile consensus, Reagan administration officials have
raised numerous objections to the bill and have said they will
recommend a veto.
   But Moynihan said the support of the Finance Committee, which
has killed many reform efforts in the last two decades, is evidence
that welfare reform has come too far to fail.
   ``If the president vetoes it, the next president will sign it,''
he said.
   Both Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and Finance
Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, have said they want to
complete Senate action on the Moynihan bill and achieve a
compromise with the House before the end of the year.
   The House passed a broad plan last year that, according to
rough, preliminary estimates by the Congressional Budget Office,
would cost $7.1 billion over five years.
   Unlike the Senate bill, the House would give states financial
incentives to raise their benefits until 1991. In many states,
welfare payments amount to less than half the federal poverty
standard.
   Both bills would require states to take stronger steps to
establish paternity and collect child support from absent parents.
The provisions include automatic wage-withholding from paychecks in
some cases.
   States would also have to set up education, training and job
programs for welfare recipients and spend half their money on those
considered most difficult to help, such as teen-age mothers. Child
care, transportation and Medicaid assistance would be provided.
   And states would have to allow cash benefits for two-parent
families in which the principal wage-earner is unemployed. Only 26
now do so. The bill says the assistance would only have to be
available for six months of each year.
   Voting against the bill were Sens. William Armstrong, R-Colo.;
Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.; and William Roth, R-Del.
   Armstrong, echoing the administration's objections, said the
bill would increase rather than decrease welfare dependency. He
said the two-parent welfare provision would add 130,000 families to
the rolls while transitional child care and medical benefits for
recipients moving into the workforce would add another 500,000.
   Armstrong and the administration support a less expensive $913
million plan that has been introduced in the House and Senate by
Republicans.
   The money for the Senate bill would be raised by extending the
Internal Revenue Service's debt collection program and phasing out
child-care tax credits for high-income families.
   In holding hearings and making arguments for his bill, Moynihan
often noted that one out of three American children is on welfare
before the age of 18.

   Government statistics may be signaling the
beginning of the end of a mid-1980s trend that saw booming growth
in coastal states outstrip the rest of the country, economists say.
   Residents of densely populated coastal states like Connecticut,
New Jersey, Massachussets and California continued to have the
highest average incomes in the nation last year, the Commerce
Department said Wednesday.
   States like Mississippi, West Virginia, Utah and Louisiana that
are dependent on farming, mining or oil were at or near the bottom.
   Connecticut was the highest-income state in the nation, with an
average of $20,980 earned for every man, woman and child in 1987.
That was more than double the $10,204 income in Mississippi, the
perennial last-place finisher.
   Also as in the recent past, income growth was strongest in the
Northeast and weakest in energy and mining states.
   But, Rudolph E. DePass, an analyst with the Commerce Department,
says the figures show growth is accelerating in the Southwest and
Rocky Mountain regions and slowing elsewhere.
   The national average in 1987 was $15,340, up 4.8 percent from a
year earlier. Taking the 4.4 percent inflation rate into account,
it was the worst gain since the recession year of 1982.
   That was reflected in even the healthiest regions. The growth of
income in New England fell from 7.6 percent in 1986 to 6.7 percent
last year. Income growth slipped from 6.5 percent to 6 percent in
the Mid-Atlantic states.
   However, income growth in the tottering Southwest increased from
0.9 percent to 2.2 percent. It improved in the Mountain states from
3.5 percent to 3.6 percent.
   ``I think it's signaling the end of the bicoastal economy,''
said Mark Zandi, an economist with the Wefa Group, a
Philadelphia-area forecasting service.
   ``The bicoastal trend came to the forefront in 1984 and
continued on through most of the first half of 1987. Since last
summer ... the bicoastal phenomenon has been on the wane,'' Zandi
said.
   ``As we move into 1989 and 1990, it will become a thing of the
past, almost as the Sun Belt-Frost Belt phenomenon waned in the
middle 1980s,'' he said.
   Zandi cited these reasons:
   _The increase in exports, which are growing as the falling
dollar makes U.S. goods cheaper overseas, will boost manufacturing
in the Midwest and in parts of the South.
   _Oil and commodity prices are on the way up, brightening
prospects for the Oil Patch, Farm Belt and mining states.
   _Growth in the economy's service sector _ which had benefited
financial centers like New York, Boston and Los Angeles _ is
slowing. The effects of the October stock market collapse are more
severe there than elsewhere.
   _Eastern states and California, which rode the growth of high
technology firms, are running into a tight labor market, making it
likely that companies will look to expand elsewhere.
   ``We can expect to see slower growth in the bicoastal states and
stronger growth in the states in the middle,'' Zandi said.
   New Jersey, with income of $20,067, ranked second in 1987 and
Masschussetts, with income of $18,926, was third. The District of
Columbia, with income of $20,303, would have been second if it was
included in the rankings.
   Alaska, which took over the No.1 spot from Connecticut at the
start of the oil boom in 1973 and held it until 1985, fell to fifth
in 1987. Its average income actually fell 0.7 percent last year to
$17,886.
   Rounding out the top 10 were New York, Maryland, California, New
Hampshire, Illinois and Virginia.
   Seven of the 10 states with the lowest per capita income were in
the South. In addition to Mississippi, they were West Virginia,
Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina and Kentucky. Utah,
New Mexico and Idaho _ energy and mining states _ were also in the
lowest 10.
   Other than Alaska, Wyoming was the only state where average
income declined in 1987, by 0.1 percent to $12,759. But the
shrinkage was not as bad as the state's 1.1 percent decline in 1986.

   The steeple stands upright amid the
tornado-tossed rubble of Grace Presbyterian Church, but it is on
the floor, not the roof _ a symbol of the damage to this rural town
and its determination to rebuild.
   ``We are going to have a prayer meeting,'' church member
Charlotte Hollingsworth said Wednesday as she searched the debris
for church records and hymn books. ``We are dragging out chairs to
have a service on the lawn, or somewhere.''
   The roof was torn out from underneath the steeple by Tuesday's
predawn tornado, which left a 12-mile path of destruction in this
North Florida town of 3,500 residents. Four people were killed and
at least 18 injured.
   Preliminary damage estimates ranged up to $27 million.
   ``No event, with the exception of World War II, affected people
like yesterday,'' said T.C. Merchant Jr., 72, editor of The Madison
Enterprise-Review. ``It looked like some 500-pound bombs dropped
out there.''
   State damage-assessment teams surveyed the area 50 miles east of
Tallahassee to support a state application for federal aid, and
damage figures were expected today, said Dick Morgan, spokesman for
the state Department of Community Affairs.
   Insurance adjusters took pictures and videotapes of the damage,
and utility crews replaced damaged power lines and poles.
   The American Red Cross reported 17 homes destroyed and 30
heavily damaged by the tornado. Chris Floyd, Red Cross damage
assessment coordinator, said residential damage ranged from
$600,000 to $700,000.
   But Hugh Ross, claims manager with the Florida Farm Bureau
insurance office in Gainesville, said he thought residential
damages would be at least $2 million.
   ``We haven't found anything yet that could be called
salvageable,'' said James Rowe, 53, whose home was demolished.
``We've got basic coverage. I'm sure, like everybody else, we don't
have enough to cover everything.
   ``The good Lord helped us accumulate what little we did have,
and he will help us again. ... We're so glad to be out of this
alive,'' Rowe said.
   Meanwhile, William H. McCoy, president of North Florida Junior
College, said the campus lost at least three buildings and nine
were heavily damaged. He estimated fixing or replacing them,
including a nearly completed regional library, could cost $20
million to $25 million.
   Damage at a shopping mall, chicken farm, utilities and other
property hadn't been calculated.
   A disaster declaration signed by Gov. Bob Martinez on Tuesday
allowed state agencies to provide equipment and cleanup crews. More
than 100 inmates from the region's jails were organized into road
gangs, said Madison County Sheriff Joe Peavy.
   The state's worst tornado since 1966 killed four people in a
minutes. Three others remained hospitalized Wednesday night.

   The deal struck by Algeria promising safe conduct to the
hijackers of the Kuwait Airways flight was not the only time
hijackers have gone free. Here is a list of earlier skyjackings in
which the terrorists were not arrested:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   JULY 23-SEPT. 1, 1968 _ El Al flight from Rome to Tel Aviv,
Israel, is diverted to Algeria by Arab nationalists. Forty days
later, Algeria releases last 12 Israelis held hostage. There is no
word on what happened to the hijackers.
   SEPT. 6-30, 1970 _ Palestinians seeking freedom for imprisoned
comrades hijack four U.S. and West European jetliners, land them in
Egypt and Jordan, and blow them up. Hostages are eventually freed
unharmed, in exchange for seven Palestinian prisoners. The
hijackers rejoin Palestinian militants engaged in civil war with
Jordanian troops.
   OCTOBER 1977 _ Japanese Red Army terrorists hijack Japan Air
Lines jet to Algeria. Negotiators secure release of hostages in
exchange for $6 million ransom payment and release of six Red Army
members in Japanese jails. Officials later indicate hijackers were
allowed to leave country.
   DEC. 4, 1984 _ Five Arabs hijack Kuwaiti airliner and demand
release of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists held in Kuwait. They fly to
Tehran and kill two American passengers. Iranian security men storm
plane after five days and capture hijackers, who later vanish.
Western intelligence officials believe Iranians let them go.
   JUNE 11, 1985 _ Six Shiite Moslem militiamen hijack Royal
Jordanian Airlines jet on the ground at Beirut airport. They order
jet to fly to Cyprus, but eventually return to Beirut. Passengers
and crew are released in Beirut, and hijackers blow up cockpit and
rejoin comrades in Beirut.
   A suspect, Fawaz Younis, was arrested in September 1987 in
international waters in Mediterranean Sea and flown to United
States, where he awaits trial. He has also been implicated in the
TWA hijacking days later, but has not been charged.
   JUNE 15-JULY 1, 1985 _ Shiite gunmen hijack TWA Athens-to-Rome
flight to Beirut. Some passengers are released but 40 men are held
hostage. One, U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem, is shot dead; 17 days
later remaining 39 are released after Syrian intervention.
Hijackers are not arrested in Lebanon after the incident.
   U.S. authorities later name Mohammed Hamadi, Hasan Izz-Al-Din,
and Ali Atwa in an indictment as suspected hijackers. Imad
Mughniyeh is suspected of masterminding the hijacking. He and
Izz-Al-Din are also believed to have taken part in the latest
Kuwait Airways hijacking, and Mughniyeh to have masterminded the
1984 Kuwait Airways hijacking.
   Mohammed Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport Jan. 13, 1987.
West Germany rejected extradition request from United States and
decided Hamadi will be tried in West Germany. No trial date has
been set.

<HEAD>Deadline Extension Clears First Of Three Hurdles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A measure extending the deadline for illegal
aliens to apply for amnesty faces a difficult fight in the Senate
and a possible presidential veto after clearing the House by a
narrow margin.
   The 213-201 House vote Wednesday would move the deadline from
May 4 to Nov. 30. The extension would represent the first change in
the landmark immigration law signed by President Reagan in November
1986.
   But the Immigration and Naturalization Service issued a warning
late Wednesday to potential applicants that they should heed the
current May 4 deadline.
   ``INS is concerned that this misguided legislation will create
confusion among potential applicants and cause them to delay filing
beyond the May 4 cutoff date,'' the service said in a statement. It
said legalization offices will remain open on May 4 until midnight
to process applications and that aliens should ``continue to expect
that the last date'' to apply will be May 4.
   The immigration law enacted in 1986 was finely tuned legislation
that carefully balanced a legalization program for illegal aliens
with penalties for employers who knowingly hire undocumented
workers.
   The narrow margin of Wednesday's vote demonstrated that amnesty
for those who came to this country illegally remains an emotional
issue. In 1986, the House approved the amnesty program as part of
the immigration bill by only seven votes.
   The extension is opposed by Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., the
chief Senate author of the 1986 law, and other conservatives.
   The immigration law is a delicately balanced bill that uses a
carrot and stick approach to stop illegal aliens from pouring
across U.S. borders.
   Aliens who came to the United States illegally, but have lived
here continuously since before Jan. 1, 1982, were given one year to
apply for temporary residency as the first step toward permanent
status. The 12-month deadline is May 4.
   On the enforcement side, the law established severe fines for
employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers.
   Those favoring the extension argue the Immigration and
Naturalization Service reacted too slowly at the onset of the
amnesty period, and did not get out the word to the immigrant
communities to apply for temporary residency.
   In addition, many illegal aliens were thought to fear appearing
at an office of the INS, the agency that is also in the business of
deporting those here illegally.
   In fact, the law prohibits the INS amnesty employees from
sharing their records with enforcement agents.
   Those opposing the amnesty extension in the House were basically
the same members who never liked the idea. They said that aliens
who refused to come forward were simply procrastinators, and that
the carefully structured bill should not be changed to accommodate
them.
   With the deadline approaching, the chief Senate advocate of the
extension, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., plans to have a vote
scheduled quickly in that chamber. He is chairman of the Senate
Judiciary immigration subcommittee and sponsored the chamber's
extension proposal.
   If the bill should get through the Senate, there could be
additional problems at the White House.
   The commissioner of the INS, Alan C. Nelson, and Office of
Management and Budget officials, have already said they would
recommend a presidential veto if the bill reaches Reagan's desk.
   Simpson commented Wednesday, ``Our numbers are right on target
with the projections we used when we passed the bill. I do not
honestly see a need or justification for extending the signup
period.''
   During House debate, the chief sponsor of the extension, Rep.
Romano L. Mazzoli, D-Ky. said 1.2 million aliens have applied for
the general amnesty program, and 729,000 have received temporary
residency cards. Another 400,000 have applied for a separate
agricultural amnesty program that is not affected by the extension
legislation.
   Before the final vote, the House approved by voice vote an
amendment designed to cut down on fraud during any extension period.
   The House also defeated 167-246 an amendment that would have
only accepted applications after May 4 from aliens who could
demonstrate ``good cause'' for missing the deadline.

   Nigeria's military government will
not rescind gasoline price increases despite violent protests that
have killed six people and forced the closure of more than 20
colleges, Lagos radio reported.
   The government radio on Wednesday quoted Col. David Mark, a
member of the Armed Forces Ruling Council, as saying the decision
to eliminate government gasoline subsidies was in the best
interests of Nigeria's battered economy.
   The price increases resulted in widespread rioting April 13 that
left six people dead, including two police officers who were beaten
to death by a mob of protesters in the northern city of Jos.

   Kenya plans to become the first African
country to send an expedition to Mount Everest, the world's highest
peak.
   Kenneth Matiba, minister for transport and communications, said
a team of 15 to 20 climbers will attempt to scale the mountain in
autumn of 1990.
   ``As a sporting nation, this is one sport I feel we must
increase our participation in,'' Matiba said on Wednesday.
   He led a five-man Kenyan expedition up the 20,500-foot Island
Peak of the Himalayas in Ocotober 1986.
   ``At that time we were happy to climb anything higher than what
we have in Kenya,'' said Matiba. ``But I got the idea that we
should send a team up Mount Everest and approached the Nepalese
authorities.''
   Mount Kenya, this East African nation's highest mountain and the
second highest on the continent, is 17,156 feet high.

   A 22-year-old woman who murdered her
husband with a hammer shortly after her wedding will inherit his
estate, a court has ruled.
   The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper, reporting the case Wednesday,
said the court ruled that murder committed while under temporary

victim's estate.
   The victim's handicapped mother challenged the bequest of family
heirlooms to the widow. ``I understand the law _ in principle _ but
in this case it's twisted,'' the mother was quoted as saying.
   Under Swedish press laws, the people involved cannot be

<TEXT>
   If Chrysler Corp. wants its workers
to accept Japanese-style production, its executives should accept
markedly lower, Japanese-style pay, the United Auto Workers' chief
negotiator said Wednesday.
   The remarks by UAW Vice President Marc Stepp came in the third
day of Chrysler contract talks and a day after Chrysler disclosed
that Chairman Lee Iacocca earned $17.9 million in 1987 in salary,
cash and stock bonuses and money earned exercising stock options
granted when Chrysler stock was a fraction of its present value.
   Iacocca's 1987 earnings made him the highest-paid auto executive
for the second year in a row. In 1986, when he earned $20.6
million, Iacocca also was the nation's highest-paid executive.
   ``Executive compensations have gotten completely out of hand.
... It makes it extremely difficult for us to sit down in a
rational manner and try to negotiate a decent contract,'' Stepp
said, adding that after hearing about Iacocca's pay, workers called
union officials demanding higher pay and other benefits.
   Chrysler Vice President Anthony St. John, the company's chief
negotiator, said Tuesday that Chrysler has asked union leaders to
support a company push for adoption of so-called Modern Operating
Agreements at all plants.
   The Japanese-style MOA system organizes workers into teams, uses
them for a variety of jobs instead of a single defined task and
reduces the number of workers needed to fill in for absentees,
inspect products and correct mistakes.
   ``We think it is only fair that since they ask us to go to a
Japanese production system such as MOAs and team concept ... it is
fair for them to go to the Japanese system in terms of
compensation,'' Stepp said.
   Japanese managers earn six to eight times more than Japanese
workers, while American managers earn about 18 times more than
their workers, and in Iacocca's case, 27 times, Stepp said.
   Chrysler workers earn $14.43 an hour including cost-of-living
adjustments, or gross base pay of about $30,000. Stepp also said
that before Japanese workers are laid off or their pay is cut,
Japanese managers take a pay cut.
   The Chrysler contract expires Sept. 14. It covers 59,000 active
workers and 7,000 on layoff in 15 states and 65,000 retirees.
Negotiators return to the table Monday prepared to bargain
continuously until a contract is reached, Stepp said.

   A man demanding to talk with Louisiana
State University's basketball coach entered the outer cage of LSU's
Bengal tiger mascot Wednesday but gave up after a five-hour
standoff, authorities said.
   LSU spokesman Gary Ballard said that the intruder had threatened
to free the 13-year-old, 500-pound tiger but that marksmen with
tranquilizer guns were nearby. The man had also claimed to have a
bomb in a bag, Ballard said.
   At one point, students who came to watch chanted: ``Tiger bait!
Tiger bait!'' _ the cry raised at LSU sporting events when the
opposing team enters.
   The man was recognized by students as Moacyr ``Bruno'' Cezar, an
ardent fan of the basketball team who lives in LSU's athletic
dormitory in return for doing work around the place.
   ``He wants a job. He has some sort of problem with his temporary
visa. He says he wants a work permit,'' said Ballard. At one point,
negotiators passed a document through the bars to him. Ballard said
it was ``an application for employment.''
   Cezar surrendered at 10:10 p.m. after talking with Jose Vargas,
the Spanish-speaking LSU center who is from the Dominican Republic.
Accompanied by a priest and two detectives, Cezar was taken to the
police station.
   No charges had been filed by late Wednesday night.
   ``He's upset, man. He's going to be all right. He'll talk to you
tomorrow,'' Vargas said.
   The coach, Dale Brown, was in Florida, but his wife, Vonnie, and
some of LSU's Spanish-speaking basketball players were among those
trying to talk Cezar out. Cezar is a Brazilian who speaks mainly
Portugese.
   Brown was told of the incident but had no immediate plans to
return, Ballard said.
   Cezar had entered a cage surrounding the one in which the tiger
is kept by taking the keys from the animal's trainer, who was
cleaning the cage, said Ballard.
   ``This individual walked up and demanded the keys to the cage.
He threatened the trainer. The trainer thinks he had a gun, but
he's not sure,'' Ballard said. No weapons or bomb were found when
the standoff ended, he said.
   Ballard said the intruder for a time held both the trainer and
an unidentified young woman inside the cage as his hostages.
   A police SWAT team stood about 100 yards away during the
standoff.
   By nightfall, hundreds of students, LSU officials and reporters
had flocked to the cage between the football stadium and the arena
where the basketball team plays.
   LSU spokesmen said the intruder had been befriended by Brown and
had become one of the LSU basketball team's most enthusiastic fans.
Ballard said the man also had been enrolled in an LSU program to
improve his English.
   ``He's been a volunteer observer of LSU basketball for the past
two years and has been quite close to Coach Brown,'' said Ballard.

   Donald Trump, who scored a public relations coup
over City Hall by rebuilding the Central Park skating rink, has
been invited to try again.
   This time, the federal government is suggesting that the
mega-developer show the city how to fix the closed-down
Williamsburg Bridge.
   At the invitation of Alfred Dellibovi, head of the federal Urban
Mass Transportation Administration, Trump plans to bring his
engineers to the deteriorated span today to study how to get it
back into operation.
   There was no immediate reaction from Mayor Edward I. Koch, who
in recent years has been trading insults with Trump regularly over
how the city is run.
   In a letter to Trump, Dellibovi lauded him as a builder whose
projects come in ``on time, under budget and built to last.''
   In 1987, Trump showed up Koch and the city bureaucracy when he
took over repair of the skating rink and finished the job in five
months and under budget. The city had spent 7{ years and $12
million on what was supposed to take 2{ years and $4.5 million.

   Miss America Kaye Lani Rae Rafko and
pageant finalist Laurie Keller have some advice for up-and-coming
pageanteers: Don't worry about your wardrobe when a good belly
dance can do the trick.
   ``Just remember, the people in the audience don't have the guts
to do what you're doing,'' Miss Rafko told the 18 contestants in
the Miss Morehead State University Pageant on Tuesday night.
   ``Don't be intimidated by the others' wardrobes,'' said Miss
Keller, who was Miss Kentucky 1985 and a top-10 finalist for Miss
America. ``I've seen some girls go out in a $50 suit and win the
whole thing.''

contest to illegally importing wild mountain lions and was fined
$1,500.
   Turner, 49, also was ordered to produce public service
announcements for two wildlife groups after entering the plea
Tuesday in Jefferson County Court to three counts of importing the
animals to his plantation near here without a permit.
   The charges were filed last month after one of the lions brought

   Gov. Garrey Carruthers is taking a look at
the effects of New Mexico's speed-limit increase from 55 mph to 65
mph with the help of a radar gun installed on the dash of his state

   Carruthers said he used the radar gun Tuesday on a drive on
Interstate 25 from Santa Fe to Albuquerque.
   ``I find the lion's share (of the drivers) are content with
65,'' he said. ``But 65 doesn't give you license to go 85.''
   Carruthers was one of the first governors to order the
replacement of 55 mph signs with 65 mph signs on rural stretches of
interstate highways after Congress approved the change a year ago.
   The governor said he was only conducting research, not handing

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson Notches Best Fund-Raising Month Ever</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson is moving up to the fund-raising
league of Gov. Michael Dukakis, who has consistently outpaced all
other Democratic presidential candidates, new financial reports
show.
   Dukakis last month raised a total of $3.4 million, including
$621,098 in federal matching funds. Jackson reported raising $2.8
million, including $330,189 from the federal matching account. It
was Jackson's biggest ever fund-raising month.
   In money that came directly from contributors, Jackson took in
$2 million, to Dukakis' $2.4 million.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Albert Gore Jr., who was expected to suspend his
campaign today, ran up a debt of $1.6 million during March. He took
out $1.5 million in loans, including $40,000 in a personal loan to
the campaign.
   Gore borrowed the money to spend on the March 8 Super Tuesday
series of 20 primaries, on which he had pinned his hopes.
   He then borrowed another $100,000 more this month before
Tuesday's New York primary, where he pulled a disappointing 10
percent of the vote, trailing far behind Dukakis and Jackson.
   Dukakis has taken no loans. Jackson borrowed $250,000 during
March.
   Gore's overall receipts for March were $3.4 million, of which
$336,312 was matching funds, his report showed.
   Because he received less than 10 percent of the vote in two
previous successive primaries, Gore lost his eligibility for
federal matching funds under election law. He would have to get an
unlikely 20 percent of the vote in Pennsylvania's primary next week
in order to re-establish his eligibility.
   Among Republicans, former TV evangelist Pat Robertson borrowed
$410,000 to keep his campaign afloat during March, including a
$25,000 loan from himself to the campaign.
   He has had to lay off most of his staff and almost totally
eliminate other campaign expenditures because he was up against the
maximum $27 million spending cap that the FEC imposes on candidates
who receive federal matching funds.
   He ended March with $1.4 million in debts and only $61,890 in
cash on hand.
   Robertson spent $7.8 million during March repaying some of his
previous bank loans. He has conceded that Vice President George
Bush will win the nomination but Robertson technically remains a
candidate.
   Bush's fund-raising crew has closed up shop, having raised the
maximum $27 million that primary candidates can spend. During
March, he raised $1.7 million, of which $247,118 was in the form of
federal matching funds.
   He ended the month with $3.6 million in the bank to cover close
to $1 million in outstanding obligations. At the end of March he
had spent $18.9 million against the base spending cap of $23
million, plus the maximum $4.6 million allowed for fund-raising
expenses.
   Bush's treasurer, Fred Bush, said earlier this month that
overall fund raising for the campaign had hit $30 million. That
included $3 million for legal and accounting costs, which are not
subject to the spending limit.
   Robertson reported raising $2.3 million during March, of which
$896,551 was federal matching funds, and $873,444 was money from
contributors.
   With the expensive June 7 California contest still down the road
and a handful of others before it, the remaining Democrats will be
refocusing on fund-raising efforts.
   Dukakis ended March with $1.7 million in cash on hand to cover
$697,162 in bills.
   Jackson had $865,946 in the bank and $678,973 in debts.
   Gore ended the month with a debt of $1.6 million, and $416,603
in cash on hand.
   GOP contender Jack Kemp, the congressman from New York who
dropped out of the race during March, was left with a debt. He
ended the month $672,826 in the red, but was anticipating more than
$500,000 in federal matching funds to help retire that. He had only
$57,741 in the bank, after raising $604,586 during the month.

<TEXT>
   A volunteer program backed by the
local Roman Catholic Church has been launched to prepare Chileans
for their first election in 15 years and, organizers hope, calm the
country's stormy political waters.
   However, the effort already has stirred up controversy of its
own, drawing fire from backers of the right-wing military
government which charges that it favors the opposition.
   Leaders of the program, called the Crusade for Citizen
Participation, say they hope to recruit 200,000 volunteers across
the country for a door-to-door campaign starting in July. They say
the aim is to promote voter registration and to provide electors
with non-partisan information about their options.
   ``Most people want a peaceful transition to democracy,'' the
crusade's director, Monica Jimenez, said in an interview. ``It's
our task to see that this happens.''
   She said the crusade's participants also will monitor the
election's outcome to ensure that it is ``respectable and
respected.''
   The government plans a yes-or-no ballot later this year on a
single presidential candidate to be picked by the chiefs of the
armed forces and national police. No date has been set.
   President Augusto Pinochet, the right-wing army commander who
seized power in a 1973 coup, is seen as the most likely candidate.
In order to win, the candidate must garner 50 percent of the yes
vote plus one.
   If the candidate wins, he will begin an eight-year term in March
1989. If he loses, an open election will be held in early 1990 and
Pinochet will remain in power in the meantime, according to Chile's
1980 Constitution.
   The country's last election was in March 1973. The military
government has held, and won, two referendums on political or
constitutional questions.
   Mrs. Jimenez, a university professor and social worker active in
church affairs, said she came up with the idea for the crusade a
year ago. Under the auspices of a church-run foundation, she
studied similar projects in other countries. They included
Argentina and Uruguay, which have returned to civilian rule in
recent years, as well as the United States.
   ``I had trouble crystallizing the idea, so it helped a great
deal to visit and study similar programs elsewhere,'' she said.
   She obtained a $1 million grant from the Inter-American Human
Rights Institute, based in Costa Rica, to print educational
material, train volunteers and pay for television and radio
publicity.
   The training manuals for volunteers quickly prompted charges of
bias from pro-government sectors for instructing that, in part, a
``yes'' vote means ``giving support to the operation of a
presidentialist, authoritarian regime characterized by ... a regime
of limited citizen participation.''
   A ``no'' vote means ``re-establishing a balance of powers'' and
``eliminating the control by the armed forces over civilian
authorities,'' the instructions say.
   Citing the material, a commentary in the government-run
newspaper La Nacion complained of the crusade's ``slanted,
tendentious and partisan spirit.''
   ``Its leaders don't even bother to disguise their opposition
tendencies,'' the commentary said.
   Mrs. Jimenez responded: ``Because we live in such a polarized
atmosphere, to talk of democracy is to already take a side. This is
the difficulty we are facing.''
   She said describing the Pinochet government as authoritarian
``is a fact, not a value judgement. I'm not using it in the
pejorative sense.''
   The crusade appears highly organized. Several supervisors said
they took part in organizing Pope John Paul II's April 1987 tour of
Chile and were drawing on that experience.
   At a Roman Catholic retreat in Punta de Tralca, a coastal
community 60 miles west of Santiago, hundreds of ``first-level''
volunteers from across the country receive intensive training in
three-day sessions. They are required to recruit other volunteers
in their regions, who in turn will seek out more participants in
each community.
   When the voting takes place, the crusade will be out to try to
ensure ``that there is no undue pressure from any sector,'' she
said.
   The Punta de Tralca training sessions have a distinct Catholic,
missionary flavor. Upon graduation, the trainees sing a religious
hymn and are given neckerchiefs of yellow and white, the Vatican
colors. The crusade's logo, of the same colors, is in the shape of
a cross.
   Chile, like other Latin American countries, is overwhelmingly
Catholic.
   At the end of one recent training session, a Santiago priest,
the Rev. Pedro Arregui, told the volunteers they were ``like
lights, small and fragile, that are going to light up Chile from
end to end.''
   ``You are carriers of a great message, a message that should
change this nation,'' he said.
   Above him a broad banner quoted Pope John Paul II: ``Chile has a
vocation of comprehension, not confrontation.''
   Mrs. Jimenez said a central goal of the crusade is to inject
some reason into Chile's highly impassioned political arena, where
pro- and anti-government sectors wildly sling charges at each other.
   For the opposition, Pinochet is a bloodstained tyrant, while he
calls opposition leaders the selfish pawns of international
communism.
   ``An important number of people have already decided whether to
vote yes or no,'' Mrs. Jimenez said. ``But when you talk to them,
you realize that often they are decisions of an emotional, not
rational, basis.''
   The more rational the political debate, the less likely it is
that turmoil will break out when the election is decided, she said.
``We are trying to promote proper civic behavior.''

<HEAD>Ballet Theater's New `Gaite Parisienne' Is Kaleidoscopic</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Ballet Theater's new production of
``Gaite Parisienne'' is more extravagantly colorful than a
kaleidoscope.
   The dancing and ebullient Offenbach music hold their own so it's
really a spirit-lifting ballet and not just a theatrical fashion
show.
   Still, on first viewing Wednesday, one was primarily dazzled by
the costumes of the cancan girls _ black hose and shoes with white
polka dots, bright skirts with fuzzy pastel linings, blouses with
huge polka dots and full sleeves gathered at the elbows above black
gloves.
   Hilary Ryan as La Lionne, the celebrity of the hour, appeared in
a lavish red headdress and gown _ the train had a train sewn on
piggyback.
   Paris couturier Christian Lacroix was the designer and in the
spirit of the occasion some women in the benefit audience wore
Lacroix gowns. It was said that the ballet's lavish costumes cost
more than $500,000, paid for by a private donor. Zack Brown's
scenery, with a pink polka-dotted bow holding up the chandelier,
was the perfect setting.
   The Leonide Massine ballet premiered in April 1938 in Monaco. It
was staged for American Ballet Theater by Massine's son Lorca and
premiered in January in Tampa.
   Lorca Massine has gone for character more than plot in staging
this ballet set in a late 1880s French cabaret. And there is much
going on in this production; there are no quiet moments. Somebody _
waiters, maids, ladies of the evening, billiard players, soldiers
and dandies or just the busboy _ is always dancing. It's as fizzy
as French champagne.
   Susan Jaffe danced the glove seller on Wednesday, Amy Rose the
flower girl, Johan Renvall the Peruvian and Victor Barbee the Baron.
   Eugenia Delarova Doll and Frederic Franklin, who danced the
flower girl and Baron at the 1938 premiere, and Alexandra Danilov,
who danced the glove seller at the American premiere at the
Metropolitan Opera later that year, watched the ballet from a
center box after being introduced from the stage.
   The evening began with George Balanchine's ``Stravinsky Violin
Concerto,'' led by Leslie Browne, Susan Jaffe, Ricardo Bustamante
and Robert Hill. The stark music and movements and black leotards
with white T-shirts provided a perfect prelude to a joyful burst of
Parisian light, color and gaity.

   Two people were killed and the livelihoods of
40,000 were threatened when a reservoir holding toxic chemical
waste burst last week in central China's Shaanxi province, the
official China Daily said today.
   The newspaper said that on April 14 a gate collapsed of a
molybdenum waste reservoir of the Jinduicheng Molybdenum Mining
Co., sending poisoned water surging into the nearby Liyu River.
Molybdenum is a metallic substance used chiefly in strengthening
steel.
   The deluge also flowed into two other rivers, washing away
137,000 trees, swamping 52 wells, toppling 25 wooden bridges and
damaging 15 miles of river embankment, the paper said.
   Two villagers drowned when caught in the flood while crossing a
river.
   The daily said villagers were warned not to drink from
contaminated rivers and wells.

   The Roman Catholic Carmelite convent on the grounds
of Auschwitz is being renovated, French Rabbi Daniel Fahri said
after visiting the World War II Nazi death camp in Poland.
   Jews by the hundreds of thousands died in Auschwitz's gas
chambers.
   The international Jewish community opposed plans to establish a
convent there and an agreement was signed Feb. 22 in Geneva to move
the convent to a nearby location within two years.
   Fahri said on Wednesday, ``During a pilgrimage I organized at
Auschwitz on April 17, I could see that the building housing the
convent had been completely sandblasted, both inside and outside.
   ``The facade and the roofing of the convent have been completely
redone. Last year, the building was simply falling apart.''
   He said a deputy archbishop at Krakow, Poland, seemed
``embarrassed'' when asked about the renovations and ``ended up by
saying he didn't know anything.''

   Relatives of some American servicemen missing
in the Vietnam War say the government is hiding information that
may show some prisoners are still alive, and they want Congress to
approve a bill declassifying the data.
   But the administration and the official organization
representing POW-MIA families say there is no truth to the charges,
and they oppose the measure as harmful to the American effort to
account for all the missing personnel.
   The two sides squared off on the sensitive issue Wednesday
before a House subcommittee, which is considering the measure.
Dozens of family members, many wearing buttons supporting the bill,
jammed a hearing room.
   The House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asian affairs took no
action on the measure, which would require declassification of more
data about so-called ``live sightings.''
   The Defense Department still lists 2,404 U.S. personnel as
unaccounted for 13 years after the war ended. President Reagan has
said an accounting is of ``the highest national priority.''
   The official U.S. position is that the administration cannot
rule out the possibility that some Americans are still held against
their will, although Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos all say they have
no prisoners. Some remains have periodically been returned from the
area.
   Those who believe the U.S. government is purposefully
withholding information about POWs have cited a variety of reasons.
Those include the U.S. wish for better relations with Vietnam, and
the government's refusal to admit it had left some prisoners behind
after the official prisoner exchange in 1973 when 591 American POWs
were set free.
   In recent years, a number of Americans have privately searched
for Americans they believe are still being held in Southeast Asia,
but have found nothing. The U.S. government has opposed those
efforts.
   Rep. Jack Davis, R-Ill., a co-sponsor of the bill, said, ``I am
convinced of the possibility that there are prisoners of war from
the Vietnam War still alive in Southeast Asia, and I believe that
the bill is a critical step in raising the awareness necessary to
find an answer and know for certain.''
   Retired Army Col. Earl P. Hopper Sr., father of an Air Force
flier shot down 20 years ago, said he and other families have been
misled by government officials about U.S. knowledge on the POW-MIA
issue.
   ``It is because of those experiences and the fact that we have
seen evidence in the form of CIA documents proving our men were
abandoned and never negotiated for, coupled with the lack of a
competent intelligence capability focused on securing information
on our live POWs, that we support'' the bill, he said.
   ``We are suspicious of everything government officials,
including those in the Reagan administration,'' said Hopper, who
said he is chairman of an organization called ``The Live POW
Committee,'' which he said represents 1,500 POW-MIA family members.
   But Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director the National League
of POW-MIA Families, noted that similar charges in 1983 led to a
similar bill, which was rejected by a House committee.
   She added that ``two congressional investigations, two internal
Defense Department audits and a special study by Lt. Gen Eugene
Tighe, USAF retired, former director of the Defense Intelligence
Agency, have completely discredited those unfounded allegations.''
   ``We have total confidence in the president's commitment and
determination to fulfill his pledge to act decisively on confirmed
information,'' she said.
   Karl D. Jackson, deputy assistant secretary of defense, and Army
Col. Joseph A. Schlatter, chief of the Defense Intelligence
Agency's special POW-MIA office, said publication of information
would make it more difficult for them to gather information.

Problem</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Reports that recreational vehicles built on a
modified General Motors Corp. chassis may spray fuel has led
federal regulators to urge a recall before the peak summer travel
months.
   The National Highway Traffic Administration urged the recall
``before the warmer summer vacation season begins'' in a letter to
10 manufacturers even though the regulatory agency has not
determined a safety problem exists.
   A consumers group estimated up to 10,000 vehicles could be
recalled. Precise figures on the number of vehicles were
unavailable.
   The Center for Auto Safety, a consumers group often at odds with
the auto industry and regulators, said it has received 36 reports
of fuel spurting, resulting in seven fires, two injuries and one
death, from motor homes built on modified P-30 chassis.
   The spurting occurs when fuel leaks or sprays from the filler
neck, particularly after the gas cap is removed.
   NHTSA's recall recommendation included motor homes built on 1984
through 1986 GM P-30 chassis, equipped with a 454 V8 engine.
   ``Our review of the available information indicates a potential
safety defect exists in the fuel reservoir system'' of certain
motor homes, the NHTSA letter said.
   The GM chassis had been modified in the fuel reservoir, exhaust
system or vapor recovery system, the NHTSA letter said.
   Dave McNitt, comptroller for Travelcraft, one of the companies
sent the NHTSA letter, said the manufacturer believes its motor
homes are free from safety defects.
   ``Basically, the only thing that is done to a unit is
occasionally the gas tank that comes with a unit is replaced by a
larger tank,'' he said.
   A study by the Center for Auto Safety concluded that 84 percent
of fuel-spurting occurs between May 1 and October 1.
   ``All motor home owners should be alert to the danger of
overpressurized fuel and never remove the fuel cap if they hear
hissing from the fuel tank,'' said Clarence Ditlow, the center's
director.
   Robert Dewey of the center estimated 5,000 to 10,000 motor homes
could be recalled, saying the number was imprecise because NHTSA
was in the early stages of its investigation.
   NHTSA said the recall recommendation was sent to Travelcraft,
Elkhart, Ind.; Holiday Rambler, Wakarusa, Ind.; Honey RV, Clifton,

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is
increasingly popular in Britain, France and West Germany, but only
about half of those polled there by the U.S. Information Agency
believe he has done much to improve human rights in his country.
   ``A majority of those in France (59 percent) maintain that
Gorbachev does not promote human rights in the Soviet Union. The
West Germans are almost evenly divided on this issue. Only the
British (54 percent) say Gorbachev does at least a `fairly good
job' of promoting human rights in the Soviet Union,'' according to
an agency survey in those three nations.
   General attitudes about the Soviet Union followed the same
pattern, with 40 percent of the French having a favorable opinion
and 50 percent unfavorable, 70 percent of the Germans favorable and
22 percent unfavorable, and 58 percent of the British favorable and
28 percent unfavorable. The remainder were undecided.
   While Gorbachev's popularity has climbed, President Reagan's
ratings have remained fairly constant over the past six months,
according to the poll.
   ``Gorbachev enjoys an overwhelmingly favorable opinion in West
Germany (90 percent) and Britain (88 percent), and a substantially
favorable image in France (70 percent),'' according to agency
analysis of a telephone survey conducted in those three countries
March 19-23.
   ``In the past half year, those rating Gorbachev `very favorably'
have increased from 16 percent to 36 percent in Britain and from 8
percent to 33 percent in Germany,'' the agency analysis said.
   In France, Gorbachev's popularity has remained fairly constant,
with 69 percent giving him a favorable rating last September, 68
percent favorable last November, and 70 percent favorable in March.
   The percentage of those polled in France who had a favorable
impression of Reagan was 62 percent, and 44 percent in both West
Germany and Great Britain, about the same as last September and
November.
   An analysis of the results, which did not indicate the number of
people polled, was circulated among U.S. government officials
earlier this month and obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press.
   The poll had a margin of error of 4 percent.
   USIA, which handles overseas cultural and public relations for
the government, periodically conducts such opinion surveys. This
one was designed to gauge the mood in Europe before the May 29-June
2 U.S.-Soviet summit in Moscow.
   Among those polled, the highest priority for U.S.-Soviet arms
control negotiations was the Strategic Arms Reductions Talks,
designed to cut long-range nuclear arsenals. The second priority
was reduction in short-range nuclear weapons and the distant third
priority was reducing conventional arms.
   That stacking of priorities appears closer to the Soviet than to
the NATO stance.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has balked at
negotiations to reduce battlefield nuclear weapons, which many
Western military analysts view as necessary to deter a potential
attack by Soviet conventional forces.
   NATO leaders want to reduce what they call a 2-1 Soviet
advantage in conventional forces. Soviet officials argue that while
they have the edge in some weapons, such as tanks, they trail in
others, such as anti-tank weapons.
   The survey found high support for the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces pact signed at the Washington summit last December: 93
percent in Germany, 80 percent in Britain and 74 percent in France.

<HEAD>House Panel Will Consider Tougher Sanctions Against South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee will consider a bill to
break all business ties between the United States and South Africa.
   The measure would ban exports from that country into the United
States and from this country to South Africa, and would require
American companies with offices or factories in South Africa to
pull out.
   Supporters, the majority of them Democrats, say this is the most
effective way to pressure South Africa into dropping its racial
segregation policies.
   Opponents argue such a trade cutoff would cost South African
blacks some 2 million jobs and would hurt American farmers and
manufacturers who export their goods.
   The way to end apartheid is by infusing South Africa with
capital to help blacks improve their standard of living, said Rep.
Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y. ``If we can help them better themselves,
they will throw off their shackles on their own,'' he said.
   The bill would affect about $1.1. billion dollars of U.S.
investments in South Africa, as well as some $2.6 billion dollars
in trade.
   A group of South African businessmen took out a full-page ad in
Wednesday's Washington Post, warning sanctions targeted at whites
would stifle the country's development and hurt the black majority.
   Two House subcommittees approved the legislation Wednesday and
the Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to debate it next week.
Passage through the House is virtually assured, but the bill's fate
in the Senate is less certain.
   Exempt from the ban would be the imports of strategic minerals
such as chromium, platinum and manganese, which the United States
cannot obtain elsewhere. But the bill would require the
administration to set up a program to reduce U.S. dependence on
South Africa for such materials.
   The bill, authored by Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., is far more
comprehensive than the sanctions against South Africa approved in
1986 after Congress overrode President Reagan's veto.
   Those measures affected about one-third of South African
imports, mainly agricultural products and computers, and less than
3 percent of U.S. exports to South Africa. It banned new U.S.
investments but permitted existing ones to remain.
   The new ban, which would take effect within six months of the
bill's enactment, would also exempt the donation of food, medicine
and other humanitarian assistance, as well as U.S. government aid
programs for blacks.
   Other provisions include:
   _A ban on the transport of oil to South Africa from anywhere in
the world by U.S.-owned or registered ships.
   _A ban on military and intelligence cooperation between U.S.
government agencies and the South African authorities. This would
cancel the posting of U.S. and South African military attaches in
each other's capitals.
   _A ban on U.S. federal leases for coal, gas and oil deals to
non-Americans who invest in South Africa.
   _Closure of two South African consulates in the United States
and limited approval of visa requests by South Africans wishing to
visit the United States.
   _A ban on direct flights to and from South Africa. Such a ban is
included in the 1986 sanctions and is in effect now.

<DATELINE>HAVANA, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fidel Castro met late Wednesday with
Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, a government official said,
after the Roman Catholic prelate celebrated an emotional and
historic Mass.
   The Cuban leader received O'Connor at the presidential palace at
about 11 p.m., (10 p.m. EDT), according to a spokesman for the
Foreign Relations Ministry, after the cardinal finished saying Mass
at Havana's cathedral.
   Reporters were hustled out of the Mass at 9 p.m. and brought to
the palace, where they were told Castro and O'Connor would be
available for a photo session. But at 11:30 p.m., it was announced
that Castro canceled the session because O'Connor had been late
arriving at the palace. There was no word on what was discussed or
how long the meeting would last.
   O'Connor received thunderous applause as he walked in a
procession to the altar of the 284-year-old cathedral in Havana's
colonial district.
   About 2,000 people crammed the baroque building, shouting
``Bravo!'' and applauding as 75 white-cloaked clergymen walked
slowly toward the altar.
   One man grabbed O'Connor's hand and kissed it as he went by.
   ``There has been a mistake,'' the cardinal said jokingly in
Spanish. ``You've welcomed me as a pope, but I am only a cardinal,
a poor cardinal.''
   The heat inside the cathedral was stifling and many people
fanned themselves with the latest edition of the Communist Party
daily Granma.
   O'Connor is the first American cardinal to visit Cuba since
Castro came to power in 1959 and this was his first Mass since
arriving in Havana on Tuesday.
   The cardinal spoke in Spanish and frequently departed from a
prepared statement, according to Gerald Costello, editor in chief
of Catholic New York, a weekly Catholic newspaper. Costello briefed
reporters at the presidential palace.
   ``The church must be allowed to develop its role as a bridge,
with the freedom which allows open communication with its faithful
and with the rest of society,'' O'Connor said.
   Despite years of religious restrictions in this officially
atheist nation, people in the crowd said they had no fear of
showing their faith.
   One woman said her husband, Alberto Jane Padron, has been in
prison 22 years. ``He is not a criminal ... he's just a Catholic
who fought against the government,'' Ruby Padron said of her
husband.
   When asked if she was nervous about being a practicing Roman
Catholic, Mrs. Padron said: ``No, that was in the past. It's
different now. The hands of the red Communist (government) are
easier, not so harsh.''
   Mrs. Padron gave a reporter a letter to give to O'Connor, which
she said was on behalf of her husband and other political prisoners.
   Another woman also thurst a letter in a reporter's hand. She
only said the letter, in a sealed envelope, was for O'Connor on her
husband's behalf.

   Six artifacts that were found by a
teen-ager digging a hole for his pet rabbit were identified by an
expert today as neolithic implements possibly dating back 3,000
years.
   Adi Haji Taha, a senior curator at the National Museum, said the
stone adzes, cutting tools with arched blades, could have been
buried for ceremonial purposes along with the remains of a member
of the neolithic civilization.
   Mohamed Saharuddin Abdul Karim, 18, was digging a hole for his
pet rabbit on Sunday near Kuala Pilah, 60 miles southeast of Kuala
Lumpur, when he found the artifacts shaped like axe-heads and
knives.
   Adi said he and two officials who scoured the area on Wednesday
also found shards of Siamese and Chinese ceramic pottery which are
believed to date back to the 16th and 17th century.
   The artifacts were brought to the museum in Kuala Lumpur to be
identified.

<HEAD>Study Says EPA Playing `Merry-Go-Round' With Hazardous Wastes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional study says the ``Superfund''
program remains a hazardous waste ``merry-go-round'' posing
long-term problems for the nation despite improvements ordered by
Congress in 1986.
   Dangerous chemicals that should be destroyed are instead still
being shifted from one waste dump to another or covered with caps
that could allow toxics to leak into water supplies, according to
the congressional Office of Technology Assessment.
   That is the major finding from an ongoing OTA review of the 1986
law Congress passed to strengthen the Environmental Protection
Agency's frequently criticized Superfund cleanup efforts.
   ``Superfund is not working,'' Joel Hirschhorn, a senior
associate of the congressional Office of Technology Assessment,
told the House Public Works oversight and investigations
subcommittee on Wednesday. ``Public expectations are not being met
by the current (cleanup) program.''
   In an assessment disputed by EPA officials, Hirschhorn said,
``In too many cases little protection of public health and the
environment is being obtained'' by the $1.6 billion Superfund is
spending each year.
   One of the basic directives that Congress gave EPA in 1986 was
to permanently destroy ``to the maximum extent practicable'' the
contaminated waste found at the worst of the nation's tens of
thousands of chemical dumps.
   Hirschhorn said, however, that EPA has opted for destruction,
usually by costly but effective incineration, in only 20 percent of
the cleanup plans approved since the 1986 law took effect.
   More often, he said, waste is still being switched to other
sites, covered by caps or treated through new but unproven
technological processes.
   ``Off-site land disposal means that the hazardous waste problem
rides a merry-go-round,'' Hirschhorn testified. ``The problem will
keep growing faster than the solution. ... We are going to have
hundreds, if not thousands, of sites around the country where the
best technologies are not chosen for the cleanup.''
   He also had an ominous financial warning, saying the OTA's 1985
estimate that the nation evenutally would have to spend $300
billion to clean up the mess ``may prove low.''
   Hirschhorn, who offered no new cost estimate, said the OTA's
studies of EPA's cleanup plans show some environmental problems are
ignored in order to avoid destruction of waste.
   EPA decided to put a cap on the Compass Industries site in
Oklahoma but made no commitment to treat contaminated groundwater
flowing into the Arkansas River, according to OTA.
   The EPA's cleanup plan said, however, ``the potential for future
fires and continued off-site migration of contaminants pose adverse
human health and environmental impacts.''
   Hirschhorn said OTA also found instances where inaccurately high
cost estimates for incineration led EPA to select cheaper but
untested methods to destroy wastes. He said OTA believes that in
these cases, incineration would have cost about the same.
   EPA Administrator Lee Thomas said the agency is aiming at
permanent treatment of wastes and that a majority of the cleanups
involve such treatment of at least a portion of the chemicals found
at a site.
   J. Winston Porter, head of EPA's solid waste program, said the
agency has not yet settled on a definition of ``permanent.'' He
said that if all hazardous waste at a site were destroyed, only six
or eight cleanups could be financed each year. EPA is under
congressional order to have 175 underway by this October.

<HEAD>Survey Critical of State Insurance Regulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most states are not spending enough money to
properly regulate the highly sophisticated and computerized
insurance industry, says a survey by a consumer group backed by
insurance agents.
   The unusual alliance of consumer advocates and insurance
salesmen concluded in a study released Wednesday that only four
insurance departments _ those in Florida, New York, Vermont and the
Virgin Islands _ spend enough to meet its standard.
   All of the other 43 governments surveyed need to spend more of
their insurance premium tax collections to improve the industry,
said the Consumer Insurance Interest Group.
   The group recommended that 10 percent of insurance tax premiums
be used to support state insurance commissions. The average found
in the survey is 5.37 percent, down from 7 percent in 1985.
   The group, set up and funded by the National Association of
Professional Insurance Agents (PIA) with longtime consumer advocate
Esther Peterson as chairwoman, hopes to convince states to regulate
the industry more closely.
   Insurance agents and most major insurance companies want this,
because they want to weed out insolvent companies, said PIA
President-elect David L. Ream of Cleveland, Ohio, at a news
conference with other officials involved in the survey.
   The survey says states receive an ``overwhelming'' average of
23,000 complaints a year, but two-thirds of the departments
surveyed don't even have written procedures for handling the
complaints.
   Many log complaints manually without computers, the survey says.
   ``Some states lack basic computer systems to deal with the
massive amounts of information,'' said J. Robert Hunter, National
Insurance Consumer Organization president and a member of the
survey group. ``The insurance industry is one of the most
sophisticated users of computer technology, yet some insurance
departments are lacking the basics in automation.''
   The study recommends a group be formed by the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners to develop guidelines for
each state department to follow in handling complaints.
   Ms. Peterson, a consumer specialist for Presidents Lyndon B.
Johnson and Jimmy Carter, is PIA's consumer adviser.
   She said the study of 44 states, the District of Columbia,
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands represents a breakthrough in
relations beteen consumer advocates and one part of the insurance
industry. Six states' departments did not respond to the initial
survey sent in September 1987 and were not included in the study.
   PIA president Willis J. Hargrave Jr. of Houston, Texas, said the
study found state insurance commissions are more effective than in
the past but have failed to keep pace with the industry.
   Other major conclusions of the report were:
   _Many departments lack personnel and resources to properly
regulate insurers. The study recommends enough personnel for
financial examinations of each insurance company at least once
every three years, which is currently done by less than half the
states.
   _State governments allocate an average of less than
six-one-hundredths of a percent of their budgets to insurance
regulation, although the average consumer spends 15 percent of his
disposable income on insurance.
   _Salaries of insurance department professionals are far below
comparable salaries in the private sector and slightly below those
holding comparable jobs in other branches of state government. The
study recommends a salary audit every two years.
   The survey showed annual salaries of state insurance
commissioners ranging from $33,342 in Montana to $85,656 in
Florida, and average examiner salaries varied from $14,682 in
Puerto Rico to $69,875 in Kentucky.
   _States need more actuaries and consumer professionals involved
in regulating the industry. The survey recommends that each state
hire at least one of each.

<HEAD>Two Former Diplomats Says Financial Pressures Failing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. financial squeeze on Panama needs to
be re-evaluated because it is failing to pressure Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega out of office, two former diplomats told Congress.
   ``If anything, the tactics have entrenched Noriega,'' said
Francis McNeil, who left the State Department last year after a
career that included service as ambassador in Costa Rica and deputy
assistant secretary for intelligence.
   Noriega ``may hang on long enough ... to bring the pillars of
the temple down around him, blaming the gringos for the ruin he has
brought upon Panama,'' said McNeil, who left the department in a
dispute with Assistant Secretary Elliott Abrams.
   And Jack Vaughn, who was ambassador to Panama during the Johnson
administration, called on the administration to drop its policy of
unilateral pressure and enlist allies in the effort to depose
Noreiga.
   ``We've never had allies in Latin America to speak of,'' he told
the House Foreign Affairs Western Hemisphere subcommittee on
Wednesday.
   The testimony came as the State Department disclosed that
Abrams' principal deputy, Michael G. Kozak, remains in Panama with
a U.S. delegation reviewing U.S. moves so far and assessing options
for further action.
   There has been division within the administration on how best to
deal with Noriega. One side wants to step up pressure on Noriega to
give up power and go into exile by imposing trade sanctions or even
taking military action. The other says the U.S. should negotiate
and perhaps ease pressure in hopes that he will accept a graceful
exit.
   Vaughn told the panel Noriega is likely to cling to power for
months, despite U.S. efforts to oust him, and will likely be
followed by a leftist regime.
   ``Even if we are successful (in deposing Noriega), the price of
20 years of inexcusable tolerance and blindness is likely to be a
strongly leftist government,'' he said.
   Such a shift to the left in Panama would be spurred by
resentment toward the United States because of its support for
Noriega over the past two decades and its blind eye to corruption
and fraudulent elections, Vaughn testified.
   He said the United States has underestimated Noriega's staying
power. He said Noriega's durability is tied to his ``godfather''
status in the regional cocaine cartel and to deep and broad
corruption in the Panamanian government and in its Panamanian
Defense Forces.
   Noriega took power following the 1981 death of former Panamanian
ruler Gen. Omar Torrijos.
   ``The cancer in the PDF has metastasized,'' Vaughn said.
``They've been at it for 20 years'' with the full knowledge of the
State Department, Congress and the U.S. military.
   Subcommittee Chairman George Crockett, D-Mich., said an economic
squeeze intended to chase Noriega has so far succeeded only in
imposing hardships on the country's population. ``The general
remains firmly in power,'' he said.
   McNeil said financial pressures on Noriega ``bear a similarity
to chemotherapy, treatment that can only work if it is of limited
duration because the side effects are too great.''
   Even if Noriega leaves because of the pressure, ``we face a
situation in which we may wind up judging that the operation was
successful but that the patient, Panama, has died.''
   McNeil called for mediation, run by Latin Americans, between
Noriega and his internal opposition. Offers to carry out such talks
have been made by the church and the Organization of American
States.

<TEXT>
   A woman accused of putting cyanide into
non-prescription pain remedies that killed her husband and another
woman was deeply in debt and wanted more from life than her
marriage could provide, a prosecutor said.
   ``This is about her anger, her frustration ... her obsession,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanne Maida said of Stella Nickell in
opening statements Wednesday before a U.S. District Court jury.
   Mrs. Nickell, the first person in the United States charged with
causing death by tampering with over-the-counter capsules, plotted
the killings to collect insurance money but failed in her attempt
to make them look like random murders, Ms. Maida said.
   Mrs. Nickell is charged in the June 1986 deaths of her
52-year-old husband, Bruce Nickell, and of Susan Katherine Snow,
40, both of Auburn, by putting cyanide in capsules of
Extra-Strength Excedrin. The prosecution has suggested no links
between the victims except the way they died.
   She also faces three counts of tampering with a product involved
in interstate commerce in the tainting of capsules in two
Extra-Strength Excedrin bottles and an Anacin-3 bottle that were
recovered in stores in Kent and Auburn, suburbs between Seattle and
Tacoma.
   The deaths resulted in a nationwide tampering scare, and
Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers recalled all its
non-prescription medicine sold in capsule form.
   Defense attorney Thomas Hillier said that there were reasonable
explanations for many of the prosecution's points and that much of
its case was circumstantial.
   Ms. Maida contended that Mrs. Nickell had an ``obsession of
several years in duration'' to kill her husband.
   The FBI was contacted in January 1987 by Mrs. Nickell's
daughter, Cindy Hamilton, who said her mother had been researching
drugs and contract killings for several years, according to the
prosecutor.
   Hillier said Mrs. Nickell would take the stand to contradict her
daughter's statements.
   Ms. Maida also noted that Mrs. Nickell was found to have checked
out five library books that discussed cyanide and poisonous doses.
   Hillier said Mrs. Nickell got the books because they contained
information about poisonous plants, and she was concerned about
potential danger from local toxic plants to her granddaughter and
children for whom she babysat.
   Hillier also played down the couple's marital problems, saying
they were due to financial stress. Although Nickell became a
permanent state employee in January 1986, the couple was heavily in
debt and faced foreclosure on their trailer home, he said.
   Ms. Maida said Mrs. Nickell became a suspect after investigators
found dozens of her fingerprints on library books about poisons and
after she pushed medical authorities for a more specific cause of
death after they ruled that Nickell, a heavy smoker, died from
emphysema.
   Mrs. Nickell stood to receive $31,000 from her husband's state
life insurance policy if he died of natural causes, but $136,000 if
the death was accidental, as in cyanide poisoning, the prosecutor
said.
   Edward Sexton, a King County police officer, testified Wednesday
that Mrs. Nickell told him her husband took Excedrin for several
days before his death, as many as four at a time, for severe
headaches.
   Paul Webking, Sue Snow's husband, testified that his wife took
two Excedrin capsules daily. ``It has a lot of caffeine in it. She
would take Excedrin instead of drinking coffee.''

<TEXT>
   A year after a partially built
apartment building collapsed, families, workers and rescuers who
toiled for nine days in the fruitless search for survivors remain
tormented by the loss of 28 lives.
   ``In all of my 22 years as an attorney and in all of the
hundreds, if not thousands of cases I have been involved in, never
have I seen the emotional effect lingering as long as I have in
this case,'' said Richard Bieder, lead counsel for the victims'
families.
   ``To what do I attribute that? I guess I would have to say to
the enormity of the loss and the fact that the loss seemed so
purposeless,'' Bieder said.
   One survivor, William Pelkey, 44, of Prospect, was standing 20
feet away when the L'Ambiance Plaza apartment complex fell in a
thundering roar on April 23, 1987. His employer, the Waterbury
Foundation Co., lost 11 workers.
   Pelkey stayed in construction work, but says he's more cautious
and is disturbed by noise.
   ``I never talk about it,'' he said. ``None of us do.''
   June Page of Hamden said she struggles daily with the memory of
her son John's death. Page, 30, was married but had no children.
   ``The hard thing is where do you go now? ... They murdered him
as far as I'm concerned,'' Mrs. Page said quietly.
   L'Ambiance Plaza collapsed in less than 10 seconds on a Thursday
at 1:37 p.m., not long after workers had returned from lunch.
   Within hours, an army of volunteers, many of them workers from
construction jobs around booming Connecticut, gathered at the site
of what was to have been a 16-story apartment building near
downtown.
   Floodlights were set up for the round-the-clock rescue effort,
the families of missing men waited in a nearby school, and the
Salvation Army set up canteens to serve the rescue workers and
relatives.
   In the first few days, hopes remained high that someone would be
pulled alive from the wreckage. Sensitive microphones designed for
searches in mining accidents were used to hunt for signs of life in
the rubble. But nine days later, the last body was removed.
   Jonathan Best, Bridgeport's director of emergency medical
services, said the city carried on the nation's biggest rescue
ever. The $7.3 million effort included 4,000 workers, 30 ambulance
services, 500 emergency medical services workers, and 700 bottles
of oxygen.
   ``I've been to plane crashes, bombings and subway fires, and
I've never seen people as badly injured as I did then,'' Best said.
   Best, 33, said he tried to shield people from the gruesomeness
of the search for bodies and recoveries. Only he and four others
removed the body parts.
   At one point, Best said, he and the four others needed
professional help. But a social worker listened to them for a few
minutes ``and lost it so we had to have him removed,'' Best said.
   Counseling was offered to the rescue workers, but it could not
mitigate all the effects of the disaster.
   Best said his EMS staff has had a 50 percent attrition rate
since the collapse. One paramedic quit on the scene after she, not
knowing she was talking to the father of a high school student
working on his spring vacation, abruptly told him the boy was dead.
   Last October, federal investigators concluded that the collapse
was triggered by a bracket that bent under heavy pressure, and the
U.S. Department of Labor assessed a record $5.11 million in fines
against contractors.
   It also led to congressional hearings in Washington that
examined the work of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration. The Justice Department is considering a request by
the Labor Department that criminal charges be brought against one
contractor.
   In Connecticut, prosecutors decided not to press criminal
charges.
   The Pages and other victims' families have filed lawsuits
against the city, the owners of the project and a subcontractor
that performed the lift-slab construction technique. More lawsuits
are expected.
   Page's father, Lowell, was silent during a recent interview in
the family's home. He sat staring at lottery tickets in his hand,
but when talk turned to the collapse, tears welled up in his eyes.
   Page's brother Lowell, also a construction worker, said John did
not feel comfortable at the site.
   ``He was pulled off another job to go there because they had to
meet their quotas, to make sure so much work was done so they could
get paid,'' the brother said.
   ``He was just a gentle boy,'' Mrs. Page said. ``I wish he'd
never gone into construction.''

   The House has voted overwhelmingly in favor of
finding more drug-fighting money within current budget limits, but
Democratic leaders said they would raise the limits if President
Reagan agrees.
   The House voted 412-0 on Wednesday to oppose a Senate initiative
to expand the war on drugs by increasing the spending and tax
limits in the budget agreement between the president and
congressional leaders.
   The Republican-sponsored motion instructed House budget
negotiators to insist the drug war be waged within the domestic
spending constraints guiding the $1.1 trillion fiscal 1989 spending
blueprint now in a House-Senate conference committee.
   It would be ``far more easy and more dramatic to raise spending
and taxes for the war on drugs,'' said Rep. William Thomas,
R-Calif., who offered the motion. But ``this is absolutely the
wrong time to abandon that (budget pact) framework.''
   The Senate, in passing its version of the fiscal 1989 budget
last week, added a $2.6 billion trust fund above current spending
limitations that could be tapped if the president and Congress
declared drugs a dire emergency.
   President Reagan had proposed and both the House and Senate
budgets already included increases in drug enforcement and
education, a popular issue in an election year.
   The Senate, however, added the amendment to increase the funding
further. Sponsors said that could be financed through tougher
enforcement of tax laws and government debt collections.
   House Budget Committee Chairman William H. Gray III, D-Pa., said
he had no objections to the non-binding action. But he said the
budget pact left room for changes if the leaders and the president
decided there were a ``dire emergency.''
   And House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, told reporters Wednesday
he would favor raising the budget agreement's spending caps for
fighting the drug problem if the Reagan administration agreed.
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III told a Senate subcommittee
last week that the government should cut other spending if it
wanted to increase the drug effort. But he did not rule out
reopening the budget summit if the president and the others agreed.

   Once again President Reagan may face what he
says is his saddest task: comforting the families of American
servicemen lost in the line of duty.
   He has had to do a lot of it.
   More than 300 American servicemen have lost their lives in
combat or to terrorists overseas since Reagan took office in
January 1981.
   By contrast, the only servicemen who died in the line of duty
during the four years Jimmy Carter was president were the eight
killed when a helicopter collided with a transport plane during the
abortive attempt in April 1980 to rescue the Americans held hostage
in Iran.
   The latest U.S. military involvement in the Persian Gulf may
have added to the current toll. The White House said Wednesday the
Navy has abandoned its search for a Marine helicopter that
disappeared Monday over the gulf. The pilot and copilot were
declared missing.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan might call
the relatives of the missing crewmen, although he knew of no
immediate plans to do so.
   In an interview in February, asked what his greatest regrets
were about his presidency, Reagan spoke of ``calls that have had to
be made to families who have lost someone'' and said, ``Those are
things for which you have to be very sorry.''
   Asked whether the contrast between the Reagan and Carter figures
is the fruit of a belligerent posture by Reagan, Joshua M. Epstein,
a research associate in foreign policy studies at the Brookings
Institute, said, ``It's a tough question.
   ``It's hard to know what another administration would have done
under the circumstances,'' said Epstein, author of defense studies
including an analysis of U.S. strategy and force planning in the
Persian Gulf.
   Reagan, who came to office charging that Carter had weakened
America and vowing to regain respect abroad with a stern policy
toward potential foes, has sometimes raised hackles in Congress
with his bristling rhetoric and his acts to back it up.
   Critics charged that he failed to think through the reasons for
sending U.S. Marines to Lebanon, where 241 service personnel died
in an attack on a Marine barracks on Oct. 23, 1983. The Marines
were later withdrawn.
   Many in Congress also questioned the rationale for the U.S.
invasion of Grenada on Oct. 25, 1983, just two days later. By the
State Department's count, 19 Americans were killed and 112 wounded
in the three-day invasion.
   Reagan, of course, disagrees.
   Of the Marine peace-keeping force in Lebanon, he said in a
February interview with The Washington Post that ``the terrible
thing was that they were actually succeeding in their mission and
that's why the violence was turned on them.''
   And he said of the Grenada invasion: ``I ... can't help but be
proud that there is an island now down in the Caribbean where there
aren't any signs `Yankee go home' but where somebody sent me a
postcard the other day ... a photograph of a wall ... painted with
all kinds of graffiti ... about `God love the U.S.A.'''
   Other killings of American servicemen abroad in recent years
have included:
   _An April 1983, bombing of the American embassy in Beirut in
which five servicemen and 12 other Americans were killed.
   _A September 1984 bombing of the same embassy that killed two
Marine guards.
   _The U.S. bombing raid on suspected terrorist facilities in
Libya on April 14, 1986, in which one Air Force F-111 and its
two-man crew were lost.
   _An Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the
Persian Gulf on May 17, 1987, killing 37 sailors.

<TEXT>
   The old guard of the Nevada Republican Party
is on the outside looking in as the GOP readies for a state
convention controlled by supporters of former television evangelist
Pat Robertson.
   Convention preliminaries start here today with meetings of
platform, credential, resolution and bylaws committees. And 600 to
650 delegates _ at least two-thirds of them Robertson supporters _
should be on hand when the general session convenes Friday.
   The Republicans will adopt what's expected to be a generally
conservative platform at the convention, ending Saturday, and also
complete the process of picking a 20-member delegation to the
national GOP convention this summer in New Orleans.
   At least 16 of those national convention delegates will be
Robertson delegates. And even though Vice President George Bush is
continuing to roll toward the Republican presidential nomination,
Robertson's Nevada coordinator says it's possible the entire Nevada
delegation could be for Robertson.
   It's also possible that such Nevada GOP luminaries as national
party chairman Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., Rep. Barbara Vucanovich,
former Sen. Paul Laxalt and others won't be on the 20-member
delegation to New Orleans.
   By the time the state convention ends this weekend, all top
party offices could be filled by a solid slate of Robertson
supporters, among them Robertson coordinator Steve Wark, who is the
only announced candidate for state Republican Party chairman.
   Wark says he wouldn't have sought the chairmanship if the
incumbent, Sally Vitkus-McKinney of Las Vegas, hadn't decided to
bow out. He also says his first effort will be to make party
regulars feel welcome instead of ousted.
   ``We're not taking a cavalier attitude,'' he says. ``This is an
evolutionary process of party politics ... We desperately don't
want anyone to feel that they've been kicked out. They haven't
been.''
   On the other hand, says Wark, ``If Pat Robertson thought it was
important to have all 20 Nevada delegates to the national
convention, it would be that.''
   Robertson is to address the state convention Friday, the same
day Fahrenkopf speaks.
   Besides Wark, the other Robertson supporters who are candidates
for various state GOP offices include Judy Cresenta of Reno for
national committeewoman and Leonard Saye of Las Vegas for national
committeeman.

   A blinding afternoon glare and
driving rain caused 39 vehicles to smash together in a stretch of
the Pomona Freeway during rush-hour Wednesday, injuring 19 people,
authorities said.
   ``It was real nasty,'' said motorist Pat Rich, whose car caromed
among several others.
   Eight separate accidents occurred in the westbound lanes, and
one involved 20 cars, said Los Angeles County fire Capt. Dennis
Miller.
   ``It was raining real hard. The glare from the sun was coming in
and everybody was driving directly into the sun,'' he said. ``There
was a tremendous glare.''
   Seven ambulances were required, and the freeway and nearby ramps
were shut down for about two hours, he said.
   A hazardous materials team also was called when one of three big
rigs involved in the crashes began to leak diesel fuel, Miller said.
   He said one of the 19 injured was hurt seriously.
   The City of Industry is 25 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Army Plans To Fire 2,600 Civilians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army will soon begin firing up to 2,600
civilian workers around the country, but remains optimistic
Congress will help avoid furloughs for up to 150,000 more, a top
general says.
   Maj. Gen. James F. McCall, the Army's budget director, said
Wednesday in an interview the service would have to reduce its
civilian workforce from 412,000 to 400,000 by Oct. 1, the start of
the 1989 fiscal year.
   That reduction is part of a cut in strength ordered by Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci to meet the terms of a
deficit-reduction agreement with Congress last fall.
   ``You can't get those 12,000 people down solely by way of hiring
freezes, reductions (in temporary workers) and early outs,'' the
two-star general said.
   Although the number of layoffs needed is still subject to
change, the current estimate ``is about 2,500 to 2,600
reductions-in-force ... to get 12,000 people off the rolls,''
McCall said.
   The Pentagon disclosed in its fiscal 1989 budget plan last
February that all the services would face reductions in civilian
employment and that all but the Navy would see actual cuts in
military strength as well.
   The Army has said it will slash 8,600 active-duty positions this
year to reach a new level of 772,300. McCall's comments are the
first to detail the precise impact on the civilian side.
   The general indicated it would be premature to discuss the
number of layoffs being planned at individual Army facilities, but
said there were 25 to 30 bases around the country that would face
civilian cuts.
   He said the dismissals were designed to meet the spending target
set for the next fiscal year. They must be implemented soon because
the service must start fiscal 1989 on Oct. 1 at the reduced
employment level.
   Cuts to this year's budget, however, are equally severe and
furloughs of civilian workers will be required this summer if
Congress doesn't approve a legislative proposal submitted within
the past month.
   That bill would provide the Defense Department with expanded
authority to transfer funds among different accounts and to carry
certain funds over from year to year, McCall said.
   ``We have had indications from at least five (Army) commands
that without any relief, they would need to furlough to maintain
their level of readiness,'' the general said.
   ``That furlough, in its worst case, (would be) as high as
150,000 people ... for varying lengths of time from three to 15
days.''
   McCall said he is optimistic Congress will grant the flexibility
to avoid furloughs because the Pentagon is not asking for an extra
appropriation.
   Congress must act by June, however, if the Army is to avoid the
huge furloughs that would be needed to help make up for a $2.8
billion cut to its original request of $21.3 billion for operations
and maintenance spending this year.
   Roughly 70 percent of all the Army's civilian workers are paid
from that account, which also holds the money for readiness
training for the active force, McCall said.

   Once they couldn't even give away
the 50-year-old, art deco diner, but its proud new owner is hauling
it 1,100 miles to the Midwest, where such neon-lit, stainless steel
roadside denizens are few.
   Inch by inch, a half-dozen workers are gingerly lifting the
Clarksville Diner from its foundation here and moving it onto a
flat-bed trailer for its new home in Decorah, Iowa.
   ``They're a vanishing piece of architecture,'' said owner Gordon
Tindall, whose father used to hang out at the diner. ``To have the
opportunity to try to save one is real gratifying.''
   The 45-seat eatery, wrapped in stainless steel and topped with
2{-foot-high neon letters spelling out ``DINER,'' is the victim of
rapid development along U.S. 1, and has been closed for several
years.
   The property, owned by a Washington, D.C.-based company
Terranomics, includes the Clarksville Motel and is to be cleared
for a shopping center
   Cori Berger, Terranomics' development director, said the company
tried to donate it to Lawrence Township to use as a concession
stand on its athletic fields, but the township didn't want it.
   The company then tried to give it to Rider College, which also
said no.
   ``We didn't want to see it torn down,'' she said. ``I'm very
glad he's going to take it.''
   Tindall wouldn't reveal the sales price, but said: ``It's worth
it.''
   He and his family grew up in West Windsor. Following college in
California, he went to work for the railroad as a track laborer.
Tindall said he was enthralled with the streamlined, art deco style
of the dining cars that lent their form to the first diners of the
1920s and 1930s. He began collecting postcards of old luncheonettes.
   ``I guess the postcards weren't enough for me,'' said Tindall.
   As Tindall began to develop back trouble from his job, he began
thinking about combining his interest in diners with his desire to
open a restaurant.
   Tindall returned to the Northeast a few months ago to look for a
diner to bring back to Iowa. He spotted the Clarksville, which he
remembered as a child.
   ``It used to be a hangout for my dad,'' he said.
   ``I don't know at first if my wife was interested,'' said
Tindall. ``People said, `he's just talking about it.' All of a
sudden, I have a contract in my hand.''
   Tindall, 40, said the diner should be ready by Friday to be
loaded onto the trailer for its two- to four-day trip to Decorah,
where he lives with his wife and two children.
   He's already conjuring up his menu once the diner gets settled
into its new home: ``We'll have pork roll, fried mush, waffles,
tomato gravy. ...''
   Tomato gravy?
   ``It's something my grandmother used to make. Some evaporated
milk, tomatoes, cooked up thick and poured over bread and butter.
You have it in the morning and boy, is it good!''
   ``I've always enjoyed cooking,'' he said. ``People tell me I'm a
pretty good cook. I make a pretty good burger.''
   He said it may take a couple of years to renovate the diner, and
he wants it near an intersection of two state highways.
   ``The people in town are excited,'' said Tindall. ``The banker,
the insurance man, they're excited.''
   Durwin Tweet, vice president of Decorah State Bank, said town
officials are awaiting the diner's arrival.
   ``The loan committee was pretty impressed when I showed them a
picture of it,'' said Tweet, adding that diners are rare in the
Midwest.
   ``I think there's one in Omaha and another in Minneapolis,'' he
said.
   Surveying his diner, Tindall added: ``I'm really lucky to have
found this.''

   Six gunmen who were caught robbing a
bank on Wednesday killed four people and took 50 hostage, a witness
said.
   Police surrounded the Banamex bank and were negotiating with the
gunmen who said they would kill their hostages unless they received
safe passage to an unidentified location, the witness, Ramiro
Guerrero said.
   The standoff began in the Gulf of California coastal town at
12:45 p.m. (3:45 p.m. EDT) when a bank alarm alerted police a
robbery was in progress, said Guerrero, the news editor at the
Noroeste newspaper in Los Mochis.
   The gunmen wounded policeman Roberto Soto Cruz when he entered
the building and they disarmed and captured a second unidentifed
policeman.
   The gunmen then attempted to leave the bank, using Soto Cruz and
customer Marco Antonio Estrada as a shield, the editor said.
Antonio Estrada was killed and Soto Cruz received more wounds when
the escape attempt resulted in an exchange of gunfire between
police and the gunmen.
   Soto Cruz died several hours later at a local hospital after the
gunmen allowed Red Cross officials to escort him from the building,
the witness said.
   The other two people killed were identified as Manuel Andoval
Rendon, a subdirector at the bank who died of a gunshot wound to
the chest, and bank cashier Rosi Maria Padilla, 22, who reportedly
was shot in the face.
   Guerrero said some of the 50 hostages also may have been wounded.

<HEAD>Former FAA Head Engen Attacks DOT</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Federal Aviation Administration chief
Donald D. Engen says the agency must be given more independence,
saying needed safety rules were bogged down in the bureaucracy
during his tenure.
   Getting some regulations approved by the Department of
Transportation was like ``a maddening shell and pea'' game Engen
told the Senate aviation subcommittee Wednesday.
   Some safety rules could be tied up for months because of the
slowness of the department, he said. The answer is to remove the
FAA from the department, he said, as the presidential Aviation
Safety Commission recommended Monday.
   ``Rules for a technical field such as aviation must be timely,''
he told lawmakers. ``Safety is often at issue and additional DOT
requirements in the laborious rulemaking process can subvert the
goal of safety from a timeliness as well as a technical accuracy
standpoint.''
   Engen's comments clashed with Transportation Secretary James H.
Burnley IV, who told the same subcommittee last month that to get
regulations out of FAA ``it has been necessary to use the
bureaucratic equivalent of a cattle prod.''
   Although Engen has been critical before of the Transportation
Department's handling of FAA proposals, he has not been as
expansive, nor has he previously directly clashed with a department
official.
   Transportation Department officials at the hearing Wednesday
rejected Engen's contentions, and gave reporters documents they
said challenged some of the claims he made.
   Engen left his job July 2 for what he called personal reasons.
   Asked by a reporter whether his complaints to the subcommittee
had prompted his departure, Engen said, ``You'll have to draw that
conclusion, not me.''
   The former administrator and DOT officials also sparred over
events surrounding decisions Engen said he made.
   In one instance, Engen told the panel he blocked The Boeing Co.
from removing two of the 10 emergency exits on its 747 jetliners to
add extra seats. Engen said he rejected the manufacturer's request
because it would have been less safe for passengers. He also said
the Transportation Department ``was strangely silent'' while the
matter was being decided.
   ``There was no waffling, no coziness between government and
industry,'' he said.
   But Transportation Department spokesman Bob Marx gave a reporter
a copy of an Aug. 6, 1985, letter from then-Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth H. Dole to Rep. Major Owens, D-N.Y., stating
that ``at my request'' Engen was pursuing the issue.
   A June 10, 1985 letter to Mrs. Dole from Henry A. Duffy,
president of the Air Line Pilots Association, expressed ``our
disappointment and concern regarding Admiral Engen's endorsement of
the overwing emergency exit deactivation on Boeing 747 aircraft.''
The letter asked Mrs. Dole to block FAA approval of the plan.

<HEAD>US Considering Expanded Protection Role In Gulf</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some congressmen are urging the Reagan
administration to have the U.S. Navy extend its protection in the
Persian Gulf to randomly chosen ships not flying the American flag.
   ``The purpose is to keep any attacker off guard, off balance,''
Sen. John Warner, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee said in today's editions of The Washington Post.
   Warner, of Virginia, said such a policy would deter attacks
because aggressors would not be sure if their actions might draw
fire from the United States. No advance notice would be given of
which ships would receive protection.
   Unidentified administration officials quoted by the Post said
the White House is considering the broadened role in the gulf
following U.S. attacks this week on Iranian oil platforms that
brought violent retaliation attempts from Iran's navy.
   Congressmen have expressed concern about the U.S. role in the
gulf, where American warships protect Kuwaiti tankers flying the
U.S. flag.
   Senate Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., has suggested
the United States could maintain a more neutral appearance in the
Iran-Iraq war if the gulf were divided into zones, with each one
protected by a different nation's navy.
   The Congressional Research Service told a House panel Wednesday
that America's allies are doing more than is publicly perceived to
help protect the flow of oil in the Persian Gulf.
   Five European nations and the Japanese have all increased their
Persian Gulf efforts in the past 12 months to try to meet the
threat posed by the Iran-Iraq war, said Stanley Sloan, a CRS
analyst.
   Sloan's assessment differed from the view of Rep. Patricia
Schroeder, D-Colo., who said the public believes the allies should
do more in the troubled region.
   Schroeder chairs the House Armed Services panel on allied
burden-sharing, which has been looking at help provided by U.S.
allies.
   Sloan told the House panel ``there has been substantial
evolution of allied attitudes toward their military role in the
Persian Gulf'' in the past year. That change came after the U.S.
Navy began escorting 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers.
   ``Great Britain, France, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands sent
additional naval contingents to the Persian Gulf region to
demonstrate that they appreciate the threat of instability in that
region to Western interests,'' Sloan noted.
   In addition, Japan took a number of steps, even though that
nation is prohibited by its American-written constitution from
military operations far beyond its shores.
   Japan offered to buy a $10 million navigation system for the
Arab nations of the Persian Gulf region, announced that it would
increase economic aid to Jordan and Oman by $500 million, and said
it was willing to contribute to United Nation's peace efforts in
the region, Sloan said.

<BYLINE>Air Force Makes Public First Drawing of `Flying Wing'

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imagine two huge wings from an airplane bolted
together without any fuselage in the center. The Air Force says
that's the general shape of the new Stealth bomber.
   Piercing a decade of official secrecy, the Air Force on
Wednesday released an artist's drawing of its newest strategic
bomber and announced the plane would make its maiden flight later
this fall.
   The service also acknowledged the program was suffering some
cost overruns and that a new estimate would have to be released
later this year.
   ``Some cost growth is to be expected in any development program
that is on the leading edge of technology like the B-2,'' the Air
Force said, using the bomber's official military designation.
   ``But the acquisition of the B-2 ensures our capability to
effectively penetrate Soviet defenses well into the 21st century.''
   The Stealth bomber is so named because it is designed to fly
without showing up on radar. While the Air Force has flatly refused
to discuss the bomber since design work began in the 1970s, its
general shape has actually been known since 1985 when former
Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater disclosed its resemblance to a
``flying wing.''
   The drawing distributed by the Air Force Wednesday shows an
airplane that to some extent resembles a boomerang. A small cockpit
rises in the middle on top and inlets for the jet engines are
placed to each side of the cockpit, also on top of the wing.
   The design allows the aircraft to be made without any sharp or
right angles. According to Pentagon sources, the plane also relies
on the use of radar-absorbing coatings on its exterior surfaces and
composite materials for construction.
   The design has long been the object of experimentation by the
Northrop Corp., which is building the B-2 for the Air Force. The
company flew a propeller-driven version of such a plane, known as
the XB-35, in 1946.
   A jet-powered version, the YB-49, first flew in late 1947 and
was tested by the Air Force. But the service never purchased any of
the planes, and experimentation with the prototypes ended by the
early 1950s.
   The Air Force declined Wednesday to give a precise date for the
maiden flight, saying only that it would occur ``this fall'' and
involve a short hop from the manufacturing plant at Palmdale,
Calif., to Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   ``As the first flight approaches, many actions associated with
preparations for that flight can best be accomplished in the open,
without compromising program security,'' the service said in
explaining its relaxation of secrecy.
   Details of such things as performance characteristics, crew size
and maximum payload remain classified, however, the Air Force said.
Indeed, some of the details about the plane's design _ for example,
the placement of the engine exhaust outlets _ have been
deliberately masked in the artist's rendering, service sources said.
   The Air Force did acknowledge, however, the plane is going to
cost more than originally projected.
   ``While the acquisition of 132 B-2 bombers was originally
estimated to cost $36.6 billion in 1981 dollars, the Air Force is
re-evaluating cost estimates for the program as a result of current
and projected fiscal constraints,'' the service said.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, lauded the Air Force for releasing more information
about the plane, saying the public needs to learn about ``a
revolutionary addition to our nuclear deterrent.''
   He predicted the bomber ``will render obsolete billions of
dollars of Soviet investment in their current air defense.''

<HEAD>Environmentalists Call For `Aquafund' To Clean Up US Waters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of local environmental groups
wants Congress to create an ``Aquafund'' to clean up harbors and
waterways that are toxic ``hot spots.''
   A report released Wednesday by dozens of organizations from New
England to California said the program should be modeled on the
government's ``Superfund'' program, which is designed to locate and
clean up toxic waste sites on land.
   ``Our waterways can only be as clean as their container,'' the
coalition said in the report issued to lawmakers.
   The Aquafund proposal and other recommendations came out of an
October conference to set a national agenda for the clean up of
America's bays, sounds and the Great Lakes, said Trudy Coxe,
executive director of Save the Bay of Rhode Island and head of the
national conference.
   ``We're trying to tell you that our bays are worth protecting
and fighting for,'' Ms. Coxe told a dozen lawmakers gathered at a
conference to discuss the report.
   ``America's coastal waters are dying, and we need to take action
now, or lose a critical economic resource,'' she said. ``We refuse
to endure another summer of coastal horror stories, where dolphins
and diseased fish and shellfish are pulled from our marine waters.''
   Environmentalists called the October conference, sponsored in
part by the Environmental Protection Agency, the first of its kind
for coastal activists and the report the first national coastal
agenda.
   David J. Miller, executive director of Great Lakes United, said
the problem of toxic sediments has become ``enormous.''
   He said polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, found in New Bedford
Harbor in Massachusetts and the Great Lakes, and heavy metals in
the Chesapeake Bay, San Francisco Bay and Puget Sound, have
contaminated fish and limit public use.
   The proposed Aquafund would create a national priority list to
identify the toxic ``hot spots'' and fund their clean up. EPA now
only regulates water quality, not the sediments on the floors of
bays and waterways, Miller said.
   Ms. Coxe did not put a price tag on the program, saying only it
would be a ``multi-multi-million dollar project.''
   The report also called for limiting or eliminating federal
subsidies that environmentalists say encourage pollution. The group
targeted the National Flood Insurance Program, saying it promotes
development of fragile coastal areas.
   The report also called for tougher environmental laws and more
stringent enforcement, and a program to protect surviving wetlands
and restore at least 10 percent of the wetlands already lost.
   ``Preventing the pollution of our coastal waters and cleaning up
the damage that has already been done are ambitious but absolutely
essential goals,'' said Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I. ``The
recommendations put forth deserve widespread circulation and
consideration.''

<HEAD>Students Rally Around AIDS Carrier</HEAD>

   Junior high school students rallied around
a student who has tested positive for the AIDS virus, shouting down
a small group protesting his admission to the school.
   ``Go home!'' students yelled at the eight people protesting
12-year-old DeWayne Mowery's attendance at Clinton Junior High
School.
   Police twice had to separate the eight protesters from about 200
angry students and parents.
   Wanda Webber, whose son is a ninth-grader, slammed on her brakes
and got out of her car to deride the protesters as ``disgusting.''
   Members of the group ``do not know what they are talking
about,'' she said. ``They are shaming the town. They are shaming
this community. They are showing the whole world how ignorant they
are.
   ``Ignorance and petty fear, that scares me more than AIDS,'' she
said.
   DeWayne was the center of protests last year when he tried to
enter Lake City Middle School, an incident that led to his
testimony before the presidential AIDS commission earlier this year
in Nashville.
   Health officials have said that DeWayne, who has shown no
symptoms of the syndrome, apparently contracted the virus from a
clotting factor he uses in treatment for hemophilia. The substance
is made from a blood component.
   The school's staff members, students and parents have attended
special classes organized by the principal, Harold Heath, to learn
about AIDS and hemophilia, which is characterized by uncontrolled
bleeding.
   The students ``are probably the most informed group of
7th-8th-and 9th-graders in the country on what this boy has, what
it can do and how it can be transmitted,'' Heath said.
   ``Our science teachers have done a fantastic job,'' he said.
``These kids are equipped with a lot of information.''
   During lunch Tuesday, several students erected signs on the
school grounds saying, ``DeWayne is not hurting us. You are,''
``Parents get educated,'' ``Innocence can't kill: ignorance can.
Welcome to CJHS, DeWayne,'' and ``Don't be ignorant. Get the
facts.''
   Another sign said, ``Fight with facts. Rumors spread faster than
AIDS.'' Near the end of the school day, students gathered to yell
``go home'' at the protesters.
   Last fall, DeWayne's parents pulled him out of Lake City Middle
School after they said they had received threats. After removing
him, he had been taking classes alone at a special school.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring. As of April 11, 33,060
people have died of AIDS in the United States.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III says he may
appoint an acting deputy while the search continues for someone to
fill the No. 2 slot in his embattled Justice Department after two
people have rejected the post.
   The position is being vacated Friday by Deputy Attorney General
Arnold Burns, who resigned in protest March 29 out of concern that
the nearly year-long criminal investigation of Meese was hurting
department operations.
   Meese's latest choice, former American Bar Association president
John Shepherd, said Wednesday he was concerned with the ``personal
and financial sacrifices'' required of him and his family for the
brief appointment.
   ``My wife and I were not prepared for the pressures to which
someone recommended for this position at this time would be
subject,'' Shepherd said.
   Meese had hurriedly announced Shepherd would be his choice April
5 in a bid by the attorney general to assert his leadership at the
department.
   Minutes after the announcement that Shepherd was withdrawing,
Meese told a Senate appropriations subcommittee he would appoint an
acting deputy. He later told reporters he did not rule out the
possibility of appointing his counselor, William Bradford Reynolds.
   The Senate three years ago refused to confirm Reynolds as
associate attorney general, the No. 3 post in the department,
because of Reynold's handling of civil rights.
   Meese later refined his remarks, with department spokesman Terry
Eastland saying no decision has been made on whether to appoint an
acting deputy and no thought given to who might fill the job in the
interim if it were deemed necessary.
   The deputy attorney general manages day-to-day operations at the
department and handles matters from which the attorney general has
removed himself in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest.
   The No. 3 Justice Department post also is vacant, with the
departure of Associate Attorney General Stephen Trott to become a
federal judge.
   Meese has chosen Assistant Treasury Secretary Francis Keating to
succeed Trott, but he won't join the department until he is
nominated by President Reagan.
   That leaves Solicitor General Charles Fried as the highest
ranking official in the department after Meese. The solicitor
general represents the government before the Supreme Court.
   In Burns' office, five of the six deputies are leaving and in
Trott's office, all but one of the deputies have left.
   Another key post that Meese is trying to fill is criminal
division chief, left vacant by the March 29 protest resignation of
Assistant Attorney General William Weld, who stepped down at the
same time as Burns. A number of U.S. attorneys have rejected
overtures by aides to Meese to replace Weld.
   Shepherd withdrew his name in the face of mounting publicity
about an alleged affair with his bookkeeper.
   There were also disclosures that longtime Meese friend E. Robert
Wallach, now under indictment in the Wedtech scandal, had
recommended Shepherd to Meese for a Justice Department post in 1984
or 1985 and that Shepherd belongs to an all-white country club and
an all-male social club.
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Wednesday that its
investigation determined that the woman who alleged the affair,
Denise Sinner, made up nearly every portion of her background.
   Shepherd was Meese's second choice to fill the post.
Philadelphia lawyer Arlin Adams rejected Meese's overtures earlier
this month, saying he had a heavy caseload at his law firm.
   Also on Wednesday, Meese reiterated there was no connection
between a building lease signed by the department and the
arrangement for a foundation to pay his wife's salary at the
Multiple Sclerosis Society.
   The Associated Press reported last week that the Justice
Department signed a $50 million lease on the bulding owned in part
by Howard M. Bender after his family's foundation routed money to
the Multiple Sclerosis Society for Ursula Meese's $40,000-a-year
job.
   Meese called the story an ``outrageous and scurrilous attack.''
He said an attempt to discredit him through his wife was ``the
lowest form of journalism.''
   Meese said the Benders made a charitable contribution and did
not pay Mrs. Meese's salary.
   James Bierbower, the society's attorney, told the AP Mrs. Meese
was hired only after the Bender Foundation made available $40,000
for a development director for Operation Job Match, a program that
finds positions for handicapped people.
   Bierbower said MS officials and trustees decided in late 1985 to
hire a development director for the job match program. Mrs. Meese
was the person MS officials wanted to fill the position, he said.
   ``Thereafter, the officers were able to make arrangements ...
that the Bender Foundation would fund the position for 1986 with a
$40,000 grant and that Mrs. Meese would be hired as development
director,'' he said.
   The MS society successfully solicited an additional $40,000
grant from the Bender Foundation to keep Mrs. Meese on the payroll
in 1987. The society has a commitment from the foundation to pay
$40,000 in 1988 for her salary, but the check has yet to be
received, he said.

<HEAD>Study: Daily Stress Can Disrupt Ailing Hearts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A minor, everyday stress like public speaking can
be as damaging to the heart as strenuous exercise in people who
have cardiac disease, and even can trigger heart attacks, according
to research published today.
   The researchers found that the common stresses can cause silent
ischemia, a painless but ominous disruption in the flow of blood to
the heart's own muscle.
   The study shows that ``previously unrecognized mental activities
have very important consequences,'' said Dr. Carl J. Pepine of the
University of Florida.
   It also appears that mental stress is a possible cardiac problem
only for people with heart disease, not those those with healthy
hearts.
   The chief author of the study recommended that people suspected
of having heart disease _ those who smoke or have high blood
pressure, high cholesterol or a family history of heart trouble _
should be checked for this condition so they can be treated.
   When silent ischemia is discovered during routine tests, people
can be treated with medicines, coronary bypass surgery or
angioplasty, a common procedure that uses balloons to open up
clogged heart arteries.
   ``Nothing should come out of this work about what patients
should or shouldn't be doing in their daily lives,'' said the lead
researcher, Dr. Alan Rozanski of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los
Angeles. ``I think people should exercise, and you can't go around
worrying about mental stress.''
   If ischemia lasts for more than 20 or 30 minutes, the
oxygen-starved section of the heart dies, resulting in a heart
attack. Although the crisis usually passes in a few minutes without
permanent damage, it may be a warning of more serious heart
problems to come.
   In their study, published in the New England Journal of
Medicine, Rozanski and colleagues studied 39 heart patients and 12
healthy people. While the men and women did a series of mildly
stressful mental exercises, the doctors used a common diagnostic
procedure called nuclear cardiology to watch their beating hearts.
   They found that a variety of mental gymnastics, such as
repeatedly subtracting seven from a four-digit number, could
trigger ischemia. The worst was asking people to give a five-minute
talk about their personal faults and bad habits in front of two
observers.
   ``It really brings home the notion that silent ischemia doesn't
just occur at extreme levels of exercise or in the highest risk
patients,'' said Dr. Sidney Gottlieb of Johns Hopkins University.
``These are everyday patients who are doing quite well with
coronary disease who, with minor levels of stress, are having
significant amounts of ischemia.''
   Rozanski noted that while the stress of hard exercise often
caused pain, mental stress rarely did.
   ``Our study indicates a mechanism by which mental stress could
induce ischemia, which if prolonged, could lead to heart attack,''
he said.
   Dr. Andrew P. Selwyn of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston
has reached similar conclusions. He equipped heart patients with
portable electrocardiogram machines and matched their episodes of
ischemia with what they were doing. Less than a quarter of them
occurred during exercise.
   In an editorial in the journal, Selwyn said that the arteries of
people with heart disease apparently fail to expand and contract
properly in reaction to stress. When healthy people's hearts need
more blood, their arteries open up to increase the flow.
   However, when the arteries are clogged with fatty desposits, the
opposite seems to occur. They respond to physical or mental stress
by squeezing tight.

<HEAD>Defendants Say Judge Makes `Mockery' of Their Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three defendants in the Iran-Contra case say
the judge made ``a mockery'' of their rights by devising ``woefully
inadequate'' procedures to determinine if prosecutors illegally
used their congressional testimony.
   In an unusually harsh attack, defense attorneys challenged the
procedures U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell adopted for a
hearing on whether prosecutors took evidence from the compelled
congressional testimony of Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, former
national security adviser John M. Poindexer and businessman Albert
Hakim.
   The lawyers asked Gesell to reconsider his denial of their
requests to question individual grand jurors and witnesses to
determine if independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh's investigation
was tainted by exposure to the congressional testimony of North,
Poindexter and Hakim.
   The procedure for next Monday's hearing ``makes a mockery of the
orders of the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia compelling defendants' testimony'' before Congress, the
defense said in a brief filed Wednesday.
   Defense attorneys threatened to file an appeal. They also asked
Gesell to postpone the hearing while he reconsiders how to conduct
it.
   ``The procedures established by the order for determining
whether or not there has been or will be any direct or indirect use
of defendants' immunized testimony are woefully inadequate,'' the
defense said.
   The three defendants are charged with conspiring to illegally
divert to Nicaraguan rebels some of the profits from the sale of
U.S. arms to Iran.
   A fourth defendant, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord, gave congressional testimony without the so-called ``use
immunity.''
   At a hearing last week, Gesell rejected defense requests for a
wide-ranging inquiry into Walsh's investigative methods and
procedures.
   But the judge ordered Walsh to tell the court what steps he took
to insulate his staff and the grand jury from the extensive
publicity surrounding the defendants' testimony on Capitol Hill.
   Gesell also invited the defense, if it could, to produce a grand
jury witness who changed his story after hearing congressional
testimony.
   ``We think we can draw blood fairly quickly,'' Barry Simon, one
of North's lawyers, told Gesell at the hearing.
   The latest motion was filed a day before today's deadline for
the defense to give Walsh the name of the witness it plans to call
at next Monday's proceeding.
   Lawyers for the three defendants contend that publicity of last
year's congressional hearings made it impossible for Walsh to
shield his staff and grand jurors from the testimony, some of which
was given under the condition that it could not be used against
them in criminal prosecution.
   ``Certainly common sense tells us that there is vitually no
prospective witness in this case who has not been exposed to, and
to some degree influenced, by defendants' immunized testimony,''
the joint defense motion said.
   ``This case is an omelet from which the tainted immunized
testimony can never be unscrambled,'' attorneys Brendan V. Sullivan
Jr., Richard W. Beckler and N. Richard Janis said in the motion.
   Gesell has said he would dismiss the case if Walsh fails to
prove he didn't use evidence from the defendants' congressional
testimony.
   But the defense said the judge's methods for making that finding
``appear designed to ensure that any dismissal of the indictment
will only follow a protracted trial with its grave risks to our
national security and its inherent financial and emotional trauma
both for the defendants and for the nation.''
   The judge has indicated he would like to start the trial in
July, while the defense wants to delay the proceeding until next
year.

<TEXT>
   For more than a decade, Algeria has
played a central role in mediating hostage crises.
   On Wednesday, it achieved another success, negotiating a
peaceful end to the hijacking of a Kuwait Airways jetliner.
   Neither Algeria nor Kuwait provided any details of the deal that
ended the hijacking, setting free the 31 remaining hostages.
   But some evidence indicates the outlines of the deal that
Kuwait's official news agency said assured the nine hijackers safe
passage to Tehran or Beirut may have been worked out in Cyprus more
than a week ago.
   Interior Minister Hedi Khediri, asked about the fate of the
hijackers, replied, ``That is strictly Algeria's affair.''
   The hijackers had demanded that Kuwait release 17 pro-Iranian
terrorists jailed for the 1983 bombings of U.S. and French
embassies in Kuwait. Kuwait steadfastly refused.
   Algeria was criticized for striking deals in the 1970s. The
world media dubbed the nation a ``sanctuary for hijackers,'' and
for a while it adopted a policy of not accepting hijacked planes.
   But in 1981, the North African nation gained prestige for
mediating the release of the American hostages held in the U.S.
Embassy in Iran.
   Algeria also was involved in negotiations that led to the end of
the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner with 145 people aboard. The
hijackers had killed a U.S. Navy diver.
   The non-aligned nation is a strong believer in secret
negotiations and in mediations it adheres to another country's
wishes to the letter.
   Khediri declined to disclose any details of the bargaining in
the Kuwaiti hijacking, which began April 5 on a flight from Bangkok
to Kuwait.
   Before the plane landed in Algiers from Larnaca on April 13,
Cypriot officials told reporters it was allowed to take off only
because Algeria had given formal assurance all the hostages would
be released.
   The hijackers had killed two passengers in Larnaca.
   Algeria promptly denied the claim, apparently to avoid arousing
the suspicion of the hijackers in delicate maneuvering at Algiers
airport.
   Aided by the revolutionary credentials it gained in its bitter
eight-year war of independence with France, Algeria is well placed
among Moslem countries in mediating between moderate governments
and fundamentalist Islamic extremists.
   In this case, it set up a top-level negotiating committee,
personally supervised by Khediri and divided into two teams, one
for contacts with the Kuwaitis and the other for liaison with the
gunmen.
   Algerian officials shuttled seemingly unperturbed between the
two sides.
   Khediri himself was the first Algerian to board the plane on
April 13. After talking to the hijackers for 30 minutes, he
announced they had promised to ``refrain from all violence while on
Algerian territory.''
   Various Algerian negotiators went to and from the plane day and
night for six days. Several times, hooded hijackers climbed down
from the plane to talk to Algerian negotiators in a Soviet-built,
yellow, Niva hatchback car.
   When the hijackers had something new to say, they would call on
the jet's radio, ``Yellow car, please.''
   When the Algerians wanted to talk to the hijackers or send them
a message, they would ask, ``Can the yellow car come to the plane,
please?''
   Extreme politeness was observed in all these exchanges. There
was never any discussion of substantive issues since conversations
with the control tower were monitored by reporters. The yellow car
was the negotiating vehicle.
   When the hostages finally emerged from the plane at 6 a.m.
Wednesday, the hijackers were gone.

<TEXT>
   Students shouted ``Tiger bait! Tiger,
bait!'' at a man who for nearly five hours occupied the outer cage
of Louisiana State University's 500-pound Bengal tiger mascot
before he surrendered.
   The intruder, Moacyr Cezar, a 49-year-old native of Sao Paulo,
Brazil, who has lived in Baton Rouge two years, merely wanted a
job, authorities said.
   He seized the keys of the cage from a student trainer Wednesday
evening and then demanded in broken English and Portuguese to speak
with LSU basketball coach Dale Brown, said university spokesman
Gary Ballard.
   Marksmen stood by with tranquilizer guns in case the tiger got
loose. A police SWAT team also stood by.
   At one point, some of the hundreds of students who came to watch
chanted: ``Tiger bait! Tiger bait!'' _ the cry used at LSU sporting
events when opposing teams enter.
   Cezar surrendered after talking with Jose Vargas, LSU's center
who is from the Dominican Republic.
   ``He's upset, man. He's going to be all right,'' Vargas said
after Cezar surrendered.
   Cezar was booked on first-degree robbery, criminal mischief and
criminal trespassing, said police Sgt. Greg Phares. No bond was set
immediately.
   Ballard said Cezar served for the past two semesters as a
proctor who was given room and board in LSU's athletic dormitory in
return for his services as an unpaid supervisor.
   ``He wants a job. He has some sort of problem with his temporary
visa. He says he wants a work permit,'' said Ballard.
   Although authorities said they feared he had a pistol and heard
him say he had a bomb, Ballard said no weapons or bomb were found
when the standoff ended.
   Cezar himself was never in danger from the tiger, a 13-year-old
named Mike IV who paced restlessly behind him. And though he
threatened to free the tiger, Cezar didn't leave the barred outer
cage that surrounds the main cage where the big cat actually lives.
   At one point, negotiators passed a document between the cage's
bars to Cezar. Ballard said it was an application for employment.
   Brown, in Florida, was told of the incident but had no immediate
plans to return, Ballard said.
   Brown's wife, Vonnie, and some of LSU's Spanish-speaking
basketball players were among those who talked with Cezar.

<HEAD>Iran Claims Iraq Used Chemical Weapons In Faw Offensive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran accused Iraq of using chemical
weapons during fighting that ended the 26-month Iranian occupation
of the Faw peninsula. Iran also began mobilizing its forces to
confront the United States and Iraq.
   Iran took a drubbing this week, losing the peninsula and having
six vessels sunk or crippled in clashes with the U.S. Navy in the
Persian Gulf.
   Iraq fired missiles at four Iranian cities on Wednesday, then
offered to stop its missile attacks at midnight if Iran did the
same. The unofficial truce apparently held on both sides through
the early morning hours today.
   Before the truce began, Iran fired a missile at Kuwait that
reportedly exploded near a U.S.-run oilfield.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, said Iranian forces killed or wounded 300 Iraqis and
captured more than 250 others in the Shemiran mountain region of
Kurdistan in northern Iraq on Wednesday.
   ``All bases and resistance centers throughout the country are in
a complete state of alert,'' Tehran radio said Wednesday.
   ``Today our revolution and our heroic nation is faced with the
onslaught of the evil triangle of America, Iraq and the
reactionaries,'' it added.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, instructed volunteers to report
to bases throughout the country ``and get ready for departure'' to
the battlefront.
   It did not mention numbers, but Iranian leaders have claimed up
to 5 million people were trained in the last six months.
   At United Nations headquarters in New York, Iran on Wednesday
told the U.N. Security Council that Iraq used ``cyanide, nerve and
mustard gases'' on a ``large scale'' during the battle in the Faw
peninsula.
   In a letter to the council released Wednesday, Iran's U.N.
envoy, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati, said the gases affected ``areas
as far as Abadan,'' an Iranian city 40 miles north of the refinery
oil town of Faw at the peninsula's southern tip. There was no
immediate comment from Iraq.
   Iraqi officials on Wednesday took reporters on a tour of the
35-square-mile triangle of the peninsula that Iran captured in
February 1986.
   Associated Press reporter Salah Nasrawi said he saw Iranian
storage depots containing ammunition and rations left intact,
suggesting a speedy Iranian retreat in the 36-hour battle that
ended Monday.
   It was Iraq's biggest offensive in its 7{-year-old war with Iran.
   Iraq claimed its forces were attacking Iranian pockets of
resistance after most Iranian forces were driven back across the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway to Iran. Iraq said thousands of Iranians
were killed or wounded in the battle.
   In the southern gulf, the USS Jack Williams went on alert on
Wednesday after an Iranian C-130 aircraft ignored a warning as it
approached the missile frigate. ``We are an Iranian warplane, doing
our duty,'' the pilot responded.
   Minutes after the plane landed at Iran's nearby Abu Musa Island,
the frigate went to ``general quarters,'' the Navy's highest alert.
   Officers said the alert was a precaution against the possibility
that the aircraft could have dropped a canister of CS riot control
gas in the area. There was no indication the plane had taken any
such action.
   Previously, the ship received brief reports of Iranian
speedboats attacking merchant shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, the
narrow entry to the gulf at its southern end, and the discovery of
two mines further north.
   The Iraqi News Agency said Iraq would stop bombarding Iranian
cities beginning at midnight (4 p.m. EDT Wednesday) as long as Iran
did the same.
   There was no immediate response from Iran. Hundreds have been
killed since Feb. 29, when Iran and Iran resumed firing missiles at
each other's cities.
   After the announcement but before midnight, Iraq said it fired
missiles into Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz and Iran's holy city of Qom.
Tehran radio reported a strike on Tehran and said civilians were
killed.
   The Lloyd's of London insurers doubled their rates on ships
traveling to the gulf after Monday's U.S.-Iran clashes.
   The premium for a two-week voyage to Kuwait doubled on Tuesday
to 2 percent, or about $200,000 on a $10 million hull, said a
Lloyd's spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The U.S. Navy destroyed two Iranian oil platforms, sank an
Iranian patrol boat, crippled two frigates and damaged three other
attack boats on Monday. It was the worst U.S.-Iran clash since the
Navy buildup last July to curb Iranian attacks on shipping in the
gulf.
   Iranian TV showed a ceremony in the gulf port of Bushehr, where
military officials lauded the bravery of the crew of the patrol
boat Joshan, which the Navy sank. Iran has said 15 of the Joshan's
crew were killed and 29 wounded.
   ``We are always prepared to deliver strong blows to the enemies
of Islam,'' said the vessel's skipper, identified only as Capt.
Maleki.
   Kuwait, which Iran accuses of aiding Iraq's war effort, reported
an Iranian missile crashed in its territory on Wednesday but
mentioned no casualties.
   A source in the gulf, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the missile fell in the desert area of Wafra near an oilfield
operated by Getty Oil, a U.S. company. Americans and Kuwaitis work
there.

<HEAD>Destroying Fetuses in Some Pregnancies Saves Babies, Raises
Questions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors believe they can ultimately save babies'
lives by selectively destroying some fetuses while sparing others
in the same womb, but one ethics expert calls it ``a tragic
practice.''
   The procedure has been performed in women who are pregnant with
several fetuses, often as a result of fertility drugs or test-tube
fertilizations.
   The chances are slim that four or more fetuses would survive and
be healthy. So the strategy is to terminate all but two of them in
a procedure called ``selective reduction.'' The two remaining
fetuses face reasonably good odds of growing to be healthy, normal
infants.
   ``In patients who choose to undergo selective reduction during
the first trimester, the procedure may offer an option to save the
lives of a number of desperately wanted infants,'' wrote Dr.
Richard L. Berkowitz and colleagues from Mount Sinai School of
Medicine in New York.
   Their report, published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine, describes the use of the procedure in 12 pregnancies.
Seven of the women had healthy twins, while one had a healthy
single baby. Four others had no live-born infants.
   They also acknowledged, however, that selective reduction raises
important ethical questions. Others agreed.
   In an editorial in the journal, Dr. John C. Hobbins of Yale
Medical School said that even those who think abortion is sometimes
justified ``must wrestle with the concept of sacrificing some
fetuses so that others can survive.''
   The Rev. Richard McCormick, a Roman Catholic priest who teaches
moral theology at Notre Dame, said in an interview that ``in the
vast majority of cases, that is morally wrong.''
   McCormick said the procedure is morally acceptable only after
accidents, such as inadvertant overdoses of fertility drugs, that
result in so many fetuses that none is likely to survive.
   ``A case can be made for doing it when it's the only life-saving
alternative available,'' McCormick said. ``Even then, everybody
feels chilly about it.''
   Arthur Caplan, a medical ethics expert at the University of
Minnesota, called it ``a tragic practice'' and ``a very sad
intervention.''
   Doctors who perform test-tube fertilizations often implant
several embryos in hopes that one will survive, but sometimes more
may grow.
   Caplan said doctors who perform these fertilizations should
implant no more than four embryos so that they minimize the risk of
multiple fetuses, and physicians also should be careful to
prescribe the minimum effective dose of fertility drugs.
   ``Once you are stuck in a situation, it's morally defensible to
do it,'' he said of selective reduction. ``But you should do
everything you can to avoid that situation.''
   In his report, Berkowitz noted that in the past, couples have
had only two choices: take their chances on a successful outcome or
abort the entire pregnancy.
   However, he said the decision to have selective reduction is
also hard for parents anxious to have babies. It should only be
done if they are prepared to lose the entire pregnancy.
   In the 12 cases described, the doctors selectively destroyed all
but two fetuses in each woman. In most cases, this was done by
injecting potassium chloride into the fetal hearts. Of those who
received the procedure, two of the women had each conceived six
fetuses, one had five, five had four and four were carrying
triplets.
   Berkowitz said that women who carry four or more fetuses are
ideal candidates for the approach because of the high risk of
complications. However, triplets ``are in a gray area and present
an enormous dilemma for both the patients and their physicians.''
   He said it should not be done with twins, since chances are good
that both will develop to be healthy babies.

<HEAD>NBC News President Disenchanted in Projections Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Come November, NBC might not abide by its
handshake agreement with Congress not to project a winner in the
presidential election until all polls have closed.
   NBC News President Lawrence K. Grossman said Wednesday he is
``uncomfortable'' with the agreement, which was elicited by
sponsors of legislation to establish a nationwide uniform poll
closing time.
   ``We're very concerned about it and we'll re-evaluate it before
the election in November if there's no progress made (on the poll
closing bill),'' Grossman said Wednesday.
   NBC's decision could put pressure on the two other networks to
abandon the policy, stated in an informal agreement with Congress
as part of a push for a uniform national poll closing time.
   Meantime, NBC is abiding by the policy, although ``NBC Nightly
News'' anchor Tom Brokaw said Tuesday night during coverage of the
New York primary almost two hours before polls closed that
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis ``may well be headed for
victory.''
   ``Nightly News'' has been making similar statements about trends
in races throughout the primary season.
   ABC's Peter Jennings and CBS' Dan Rather both said Tuesday night
during their broadcasts that they could not predict the election
because polls were still open in New York. The polls closed at 9
p.m.
   NBC's report followed a local WNBC-TV newscast predicting
Dukakis as the winner statewide and Jesse Jackson as carrying New
York City.
   Grossman insisted the NBC report did not violate the agreement
with Congress because it wasn't technically a ``projection.''
   In a 1985 letter to Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., Grossman, like his
counterparts at ABC and CBS, vowed NBC would ``not use the exit
poll data we gather to suggest the probable winner in any state
until polls in that state have closed.''
   The letter was part of an agreement sought by Swift and Rep.
William Thomas, R-Calif., to help their legislation proposing a
uniform poll closing time in presidential election years.
   Swift criticized NBC's Tuesday evening report for not being true
to the ``spirit'' of network policy. ``However, one might argue the
letter of it,'' Swift said in a statement.
   He praised ABC and CBS for explicitly stating that they would
not make a prediction until the polls closed.
   ``It is my hope that this is just an error and that NBC News
will reaffirm its policy and that the other news operations will
not see this incident as cause to abandon their policy or
practice,'' Swift said.
   ``It's a very frustrating situation,'' said Tom Bettag,
executive producer of the ``CBS Evening News.''
   ``I think somebody's got to seriously rethink how this all
works. It is very frustrating to be in the position we were in last
night, knowing that your opposition has for weeks been
characterizing elections. It's a very uncomfortable position to be
in.''
   By the time the networks go on the air, they usually have exit
polling data upon which they could accurately predict the outcome
of the election. Release of such information theoretically
disenfranchises voters still waiting to cast votes. In a
presidential election, polls in Western states are still open after
polls on the East Coast and in the Midwest have closed.
   Ironically, it was not the networks but then-President Jimmy
Carter who sparked the most controversy when in 1980, he conceded
the presidential election to Ronald Reagan before polls on the West
Coast had closed.

   The dollar finished higher Thursday against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo, while stock prices lost slightly.
   The dollar ended the day at 124.30 yen, up 0.40 yen from its
close of 123.90 yen Wednesday. It had opened the day at 124.27 yen
and fluctuated in narrow range of 124.20 yen to 124.36 yen.
   ``The dollar is somewhat strengthened following overnight
dollar-purchasings in overseas markets and the selling of European
currencies,'' said an exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in
Tokyo.
   The dealer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a U.S.
Labor Department report Wednesday that American consumer prices
jumped 0.5 percent during March had no major impact on the currency
market.
   ``The worsening figures were what many expected,'' the dealer
said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
a 207.09-point winner Wednesday, shed a light 35.93 points, or 0.13
percent, closing the day at 26,828.16.
   ``The third consecutive setback on Wall Street overnight
prompted a sense of uncertainty over market propects among
investors,'' said an official of a major securities firm, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   He said trading was thin as institutional investors stayed out
of the market.

of the Faw peninsula by the Iraqi military and filed the following
report:

<TEXT>
   Jubilant Iraqi soldiers chanted slogans and
waved their rifles before a mural of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini to celebrate the recapture of this shell-blasted town at
Iraq's southern tip.
   Faw lay battered and virtually unpopulated around them, its
walls still marked with murals of Iranian leaders and slogans in
Iran's Farsi tongue.
   But Iraq's seizure this week of the dusty, windswept town, two
years after Iran captured it, was probably Iraq's most important
offensive victory since the war began in September 1980.
   By the time reporters visited Wednesday evening, Iraqi forces
who had stormed the desolate battleground on Sunday appeared to
have driven Iranian troops back across the Shatt al-Arab waterway
that divides the warring nations.
   Soldiers in green Iraqi uniforms made tea at a leisurely pace in
front of former Iranian bunkers 100 yards from the Shatt on the
edge of Faw.
   In the distance, Iraqi gunners periodically fired shells across
the broad river, and Iranians answered with occasional shelling of
their own.
   Nearly every building in the town was partly crumbled by
shelling, and giant oil storage tanks nearby were melted and
twisted by fire.
   Although Iran reportedly once had 50,000 soldiers in the Faw
region, controlling the southern 8 to 12 miles of the peninsula,
reporters on Wednesday saw no Iranian bodies and only moderate
numbers of freshly destroyed weaponry.
   The sides of roads leading from Faw to Basra were littered with
twisted tanks and mangled trucks. Much of the wreckage, however,
was rusted or half buried by the choking dust, remnants of the
massive 1986 battles.
   Iraqi officials provided no briefing on the battle or the
casualties suffered by the two sides. Iraq previously has said that
thousands of Iranians were killed or wounded in the battle.
   The battlefield itself was a vast and flat drained marshland,
churned and diked by defense works ranging from foxholes to massive
earthen barriers.
   As cars, trucks and tanks struggled through huge clouds of
powdery dust blown up from the field on one side of the road,
shallow marshes sprouting reeds appeared on the other.
   At United Nations headquarters in New York, Iran on Wednesday
told the U.N. Security Council that Iraq used ``cyanide, nerve and
mustard gases'' on a ``large scale'' during the battle in the Faw
peninsula.
   In a letter to the council released Wednesday, Iran's U.N.
envoy, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati, said the gases affected ``areas
as far as Abadan,'' an Iranian city 40 miles north of Faw. There
was no immediate comment from Iraq.
   Associated Press reporter Salah Nasrawi said hundreds of Iranian
prisoners were shown to a group of journalists that was the first
to reach the peninsula after Iran had been driven out.

<HEAD>Booster Shots Prolong Effect of Experimental AIDS Vaccine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A researcher who gave himself an experimental
AIDS vaccine still showed immune system defenses against the AIDS
virus a year later, thanks to booster treatments, scientists
reported today.
   But the booster procedure must be simplified before it could be
used in large-scale tests to see if the vaccine can actually
prevent AIDS virus infection, they said.
   ``We are in the process of finding an easier way,'' said Daniel
Zagury of the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, who made
headlines in March 1987 by reporting that he and some volunteers
had been given the vaccine.
   It was the first reported human test of a vaccine against
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. There have been no side
effects, he said.
   The vaccine was essentially a vaccinia virus genetically
modified to produce an AIDS virus protein called gp160. The idea
was that the immune system would react to the protein, raising
defenses that also might fight the AIDS virus.
   In last year's report, Zagury and co-authors said the vaccine
made his immune system produce two kinds of defenses: proteins
called antibodies and special blood cells.
   Evidence of defenses appeared up to 370 days after the initial
vaccination, he and his colleagues wrote in today's British journal
Nature. But there is no proof that the Zagury could have resisted
infection by the AIDS virus, he and 16 scientists from Belgium,
Zaire and the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., wrote.
   Zagury received three booster treatments.
   About three months after the vaccination, blood cells were drawn
from him and infected with more modified vaccinia virus. Then the
cells were re-injected through a slow-drip intravenous line, a
process that took about 3{ hours, Zagury said in a telephone
interview.
   The second and third boosters were injections of the AIDS virus
protein, given 299 days and 350 days after the initial vaccine. Two
unvaccinated volunteers who received only the protein shots showed
no immune system response.
   Zagury showed antibodies against the AIDS virus protein 13 days
after the first booster, a reaction lasting three months. Nine days
after second treatment, more antibodies against the AIDS virus
protein and against a viral protein made from it, called gp120,
appeared. Those levels rose after the third booster.
   Tests at various times showed that under certain conditions,
immune system factors in Zagury's blood inhibited two dissimilar
strains of the AIDS virus from infecting cells in the test tube.
   Each booster treatment also markedly increased the ability of
Zagury's immune system cells to proliferate when exposed to either
strain in the test tube. In addition, his immune system cells could
destroy virus-infected cells for a time after each booster
treatment.
   In another test, doses of AIDS virus protein were injected just
under the surface of Zagury's skin before the second booster and 20
days after the third. His immune system reacted each time, showing
it was still primed.
   The process of removing, treating and re-injecting immune system
cells would be too cumbersome to use in a large-scale experiment,
as would be required to test the vaccine's effectiveness, Zagury
said.
   Bernard Moss, an American AIDS vaccine expert, said the fact
that Zagury's immune system acted against quite different strains
of the AIDS virus is significant.
   Many previous studies suggested that a vaccine using one strain
might not work against other strains of the highly variable AIDS
virus, said Moss, chief of the laboratory of viral diseases at the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

<TEXT>
   In a state where thousands of empty miles promise
little more than highway hypnosis, and today's culinary special may
be a bowl of truck-stop chili, relief is in sight for the
culturally bereft.
   A new guidebook takes some of the mystery out of the seemingly
endless ribbons of roadway in the Lone Star state by detailing
motels, restaurants, gas stations, convenience stores and bank
machines at every Texas freeway exit.
   ``Just gathering the information was a monumental effort,'' said
Bill Cima, who probed the delights of 2,400 exits during a
four-month, 7,000-mile jaunt to assemble ``Sunset Highway Services
Directory, Exit-By-Exit.''
   His Baedeker of the beaten track is a must, for example, at exit
761-761A in west Houston, where finicky tourists must decide
whether they want to get gas at the Shell, Mobil, Conoco, Gulf or
Exxon stations.
   Hungry motorists can eat at Platters or Steak & Ale or perhaps
pick up something at the 24-hour Stop N Go. Sunbelt National bank
also is at the exit.
   The 288-page soft-cover book also includes Arizona and New
Mexico, and Cima and his wife eventually want to write a 10-book
series covering the entire country. But mostly, except for about 50
pages, the guide concerns Texas, which Cima said ``has its own
character and personality.''
   Shortly after drivers reach Exit 0 at the Texas-New Mexico
border, he points out, there's an anti-littering sign: ``Don't Mess
with Texas.''
   ``That says it all,'' Cima said. ``It's very clear when you
enter Texas, you've entered the Lone Star State.''
   The Cimas' inaugural effort two years ago was a similar book
about California. Cima's wife, Saundra, an airline flight
attendant, came up with the idea after repeatedly driving home to
San Diego from Los Angeles and worrying about where to pull off the
freeway if her car broke down.
   Cima, a former Navy test pilot, cruised every Texas freeway and
many other highways with three other drivers, getting off at each
exit to make note of the services available to motorists.
   ``That was the only way to get complete information,'' Cima said
recently from his base in San Diego.
   Besides restaurants, motels and service stations, the listings
include shopping centers, hospitals and police stations. A second
driver later retraced most of the routes to verify the information.
   ``The Southwest really seemed like a pretty good idea,'' he
said. ``With all the RV (recreational vehicle) traffic and all the
people coming to Arizona, New Mexico and Texas from the North, it
seemed like a logical extension of California.''
   ``As it turns out, California has more exits than Texas,'' he
said. ``California had 2,800. But obviously there are more miles of
driving in Texas. The exits come a little closer in California, so
that makes the book a little more valuable commodity in Texas.''
   About 50,000 copies of the book, priced at $12.95, are being
distributed to bookstores in Texas.
   ``We hope to sell a lot more than that,'' said Cima. ``The book
should be good for about two years. Things aren't changing all that
rapidly. What you see is a few more businesses will pop up.
Everything we have listed is going to be there in a few years.''

   A district attorney has been asked to bring
charges against a television reporter who registered five times for
this week's primary election to underscore the potential for fraud.
   In a report broadcast Wednesday, WCBS-TV's Barbara Nevins told
how she registered to vote in the city boroughs of Manhattan,
Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and in suburban Nassau County,
using similar names and friends' addresses.
   Ms. Nevins said she got three voter registration cards and was
admitted to vote at five polling places Tuesday, although the
report stressed she voted only once.
   On Wednesday, Ms. Nevins interviewed Bea Dolen, executive
director of the city's Board of Elections, who conceded that the
computer registration process may need to be updated.
   After the reporter left, Mrs. Dolen contacted District Attorney
Robert M. Morganthau and asked him to prosecute the reporter for
felony violations of the election law. It is illegal to give false
information to election officials or to obtain a false registration.
   ``What she did is against the law,'' Mrs. Dolen said. ``She is
admitting on television that she committed two Class-E felonies.''
   Gloria Montealegre, a spokeswoman for Morganthau, confirmed that
he spoke with Mrs. Dolan, but said no investigation had been
started. She said he had no further comment.
   The report did not suggest that widespread fraud had been
committed in Tuesday's primary, but stressed that an organized
campaign to rig a local election might work.
   Ms. Nevins admitted she broke the law, but said it was the only
way to test the potential for fraud.
   Mrs. Dolen claimed that fraudulent registration was rare, but
breaking the law on television would encourage others to do it.
   ``I told her, `If you go on television, people who have never
thought about doing something like this will think about doing so.'
I think she's really out of line,'' she said.

   Gov. George Deukmejian has endorsed Vice
President George Bush for the Republican nomination for president
saying he hadn't endorsed Bush earlier because he had pledged he
would remain neutral for the June 7 California primary.
   But since all of the other Republican candidates have withdrawn
from active contention, it is now appropriate to endorse Bush,
Deukmejian said.
   Deukmejian said Bush ``is unmatched in terms of the experience
and in terms of the leadership he has demonstrated'' and that the
vice president ``has demonstrated his strong support and loyalty to
President Reagan and to Republican ideals.''
   Asked by reporters at a news conference if he had supported Bush
from the start, or had favored one of the other GOP contenders,
Deukmejian briefly replied, ``I'm going to keep that to myself.''
   The California governor has been mentioned as a possible vice
presidential running mate with Bush.

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Restore Michigan Primary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Michigan Senate has decided to
reinstate a presidential primary to replace the caucuses used in
1984 and this year to distribute delegates to the Democratic and
Republica national conventions.
   The bill, which had been the subject of several months of
delicate bipartisan negotiations, passed overwhelmingly in a 32-5
vote on Wednesday and was sent to the House.
   The legislation, which is expected to pass in the House, would
restore the closed primary for the 1992 presidential elections,
requiring voters to declare their party preference 30 days before
the election.
   ``A closed primary is better than no primary at all,'' declared
Sen. Dick Posthumus, R-Alto, the bill's sponsor.
   Sen. Vernon Ehlers, R-Grand Rapids, compared the bill to this
year's caucus system and said: ``It's much better to have the
direct participation of the people.''
   But ``It's going to reduce dramatically the number of people who
will vote in that primary,'' said Sen. Joseph Conroy, D-Flint.
   Michigan launched its latest presidential primary to allocate
delegates to the national presidential conventions among the
various White House hopefuls in 1972. Democrats quit using the
primary after 1976 because their national rules prohibited open
primaries, and the GOP dropped it after 1980.
   The primary has been estimated to cost the state about $5.2
million.

   Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Dukakis
turned the tables briefly on reporters at a recent news conference.
   The Massachusetts governor opened his news conference Wednesday
morning asking about eight reporters in his traveling contingent
who were aboard a plane that made a tense but safe landing Tuesday
night.
   The pilots of the chartered Falcon 20 jet, which followed
Dukakis' plane from a side trip to Philadelphia, landed at
LaGuardia Airport on a runway lined with fire trucks and other
emergency vehicles after they received a warning indicating a
malfunction with the landing gear.
   ``In addition to my respect for you as professionals I want you
all to be safe and secure,'' Dukakis said.
   Then, turning to press secretary Mark Gearan, Dukakis said, ``We

   Ohio's top Democrats say they will remain
neutral despite Michael Dukakis' New York primary victory making
him the front-runner for the party's presidential nomination.
   In fact, they differed Wednesday on whether the Masschusetts
governor had locked up the party's nomination based on his showing
in New York.
   Sen. John Glenn said Dukakis seemed virtually assured of the
nomination, but Gov. Richard Celeste and Ohio Democratic Chairman
James Ruvolo cautioned, however, that it was too early to count out
Jesse Jackson.
   ``I would presume at this point it looks like Dukakis is going
to be the candidate,'' Glenn told reporters during an informal
morning briefing in Washington. ``I don't think there's a whole lot
of doubt about that. The New York thing almost locks it up for
Dukakis, or comes close to it.''
   Celeste said a crucial battle looms June 7 in California, where
he noted that a Democratic front-runner has not won a primary since
1972.
   ``It's not over, although Dukakis got a big boost going into
Pennsylvania and Ohio,'' Ruvolo said of the New York results.
   However, Ruvolo said he would not endorse a candidate prior to
Ohio's May 3 primary because he wants to see that Jackson ``has a
fair shot'' in Ohio.

   Pilots at Keesler Air Force Base didn't
scramble to get into their F-16s when a Soviet MiG-15 fighter jet
landed there.
   Paul Entrekin landed the Korean War-era MiG Wednesday as part of
the base's annual open house.
   Entrekin, 33, has been flying the plane, which was built by the
Soviets in China in 1954, to air shows for the past eight months.
   The former Marine from Chino, Calif., bought the 31-foot-long
jet, which has a wingspan of 32 feet, from an American airplane
dealer in December 1986.
   Entrekin's plane is one of 17 privately owned MiGs in the United
States. Recently, he said, the Chinese decided to discard some of
the 5,000 MiG-15s built by the Soviets in the '50s. Poland also has
sold some to make a profit on the world market, he said.
   At Keesler, the MiG was the center of attention for much of the
morning and early afternoon.
   ``It's amazing _ smaller than I expected,'' said J.M. Dunnan
Jr., 63, of Jackson. Dunnan is a member of the Jackson wing of the
Confederate Air Force, which restores and flies vintage warplanes.
``I've never seen one of those close up before.''

<HEAD>Elderly Alderwoman Helps Nab Shooting Suspect</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 70-year-old alderwoman credited with helping
catch a shooting suspect says she has been patrolling her
crime-ridden, economically depressed ward since she was assigned a
bodyguard earlier this year.
   Before the bodyguard, Anna Langford said, she jumped into the
middle of sticky situations on her own.
   ``I have a desire to see my ward free of crime, and if they know
somebody out there is watching them and working with the police, it
may be a deterrent,'' Ms. Langford said Wednesday.
   Ms. Langford said she and her bodyguard, police officer Eddie
McCann, decided to end an evening of cruising for crime Tuesday
when they heard over a police scanner that someone had been shot.
   When they arrived at the scene, the victim _ who had been shot
four times in a squabble over a girlfriend _ already had been taken
to the hospital, Ms. Langford said.
   The suspect had fled, but a few women were standing around
``screaming and crying,'' McCann said.
   ``She (Ms. Langford) was the one who calmed the women down in
order for us to get a description of the offender and the direction
of his flight,'' McCann said.
   Ms. Langford also persuaded the women to tell police the name
and address of the suspect, McCann said.
   McCann said he and a detective found the suspect, Kevin Smith,
in a closet of the apartment the women had directed them to. Smith
was arrested and has been charged with attempted murder, police
said.
   ``If the alderwoman hadn't been on the scene, the offender could
very well still be at large,'' McCann said.
   ``Intervening in street incidents ... is something I've always
done,'' said Ms. Langford, a retired criminal lawyer.
   Ms. Langford said she was assigned a bodyguard because of recent
threats on her life. ``But we've turned out to be a crime fighting
team. He and I are just naturally into things.''
   The 19-year-old shooting victim was in fair condition today,
Cook County Hospital officials said.

   The dollar closed higher against the Japanese yen
today, recovering most of its losses from the day before, while
stock prices slipped back slightly.
   The dollar closed at 124.30 yen, up 0.40 yen from its close of
123.90 yen Wednesday, when it lost 0.47 yen. It had opened the day
at 124.27 yen and fluctuated in a narrow range between 124.20 yen
and 124.36 yen.
   ``Trading was quiet without particular incentives to stimulate
the market,'' said a dealer at a major commercial bank, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Except for transactions of light amounts by some trading houses,
most investors sidestepped the market, partly because of possible
intervention by the Bank of Japan, he said.
   The Bank of Japan does not officialy comment on its market
activities.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
issues, a 207.09-point winner Wednesday, lost a light 35.93 points,
or 0.13 percent, to end the day at 26,828.16.
   Traders said investors, already inclined to stay on the
sidelines as the holiday season approaches, were even more cautious
because of developments in the U.S. bond and stock markets. The
Tokyo market will be closed on April 29, and May 3-5 for national
holidays.
   Other than some activity in speculative issues, trading was
lackluster, the traders said.
   Volume on the first section trade was estimated at 650 million
shares, down from 1 billion shares Wednesday. Declining issues
outpaced advancers 501 to 402, while 155 issues were unchanged.
   Among the major losers were steels and shipbuildings.
Electricals, nonferrous metals, oils were also lower. Some of the
autos rose.

<HEAD>Roh Vows To Crackdown On Election-Related Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo today said he
would not tolerate more violence in the National Assembly campaign.
The opposition called for more protests, claiming the government
sought to rig the elections.
   Police, meanwhile, today released about 30 governing party
supporters who were held hostage by opposition party supporters in
a city south of Seoul after a dispute over campaign literature. On
Wednesday, about 30 people were injured in scattered violence
related to the election.
   Roh today said his governing Democratic Justice Party must
retain its majority in the assembly in Tuesday's elections to
ensure national stability and the introduction of full democracy.
   ``Whoever violates the law and destroys democratic order must be
punished severely in the name of the people,'' he said in a
nationally televised news conference.
   Opposition leaders charged the government was conspiring to rig
the elections. They warned they would call for a repeat of the
nationwide violence that hit the nation last June if the elections
are rigged.
   ``The ruling party will face popular resistance and disobedience
if its irregularities and unfair campaigning continue,'' said
opposition leader Kim Dae-jung of the Party for Peace and Democracy.
   Rival opposition leader Kim Young-sam of the Reunification
Democratic Party said he would be forced to make a ``grave
decision'' if the government cheated: ``The Roh regime should not
forget the lesson from the June struggle.''
   All political parties have been wooing voters with money, meals
and free day trips in frenzied races for assembly seats. But there
has been no sign so far of government election rigging.
   Police secured the release early today of about 30 governing
party supporters who were held hostage by the Kim Dae-jung's party
in Youngam, 120 miles south of Seoul.
   Police said they promised to investigate a clash between the two
groups.
   The opposition supporters seized the Democratic Justice members
after a quarrel over distributing campaign leaflets and held them
in a Peace and Democracy party office that was surrounded by 600
riot police.
   The hostages were tied up and smeared with red paint.
   Angry opposition supporters later marched on a police station
after police arrested some Peace and Democracy party members
involved in the incident. Riot police broke up the protest with
volleys of tear gas and arrested seven people.
   At least 33 people were injured Wednesday in scattered clashes
between government and opposition supporters in the cities of
Masan, Jungju, Kohung and Andong.
   Roh appealed for orderly elections and accused the opposition of
fomenting unrest. He said his party must keep control of the
National Assembly if it is to govern effectively.
   ``It is my desire to see the ruling party win a majority of
seats in the National Assembly in order for me to effectively run
the government,'' he said.
   The government may have trouble retaining its majority in the
assembly because of public reluctance to accept the Roh government.
   Roh took office in February after winning a five-year
presidential term with 33.6 percent of the vote in December after
rival opposition candidates split the opposition vote.
   Roh, an ex-general who helped put former President Chun Doo-hwan
in power with military backing in 1980, has attempted to cut his
ties to the authoritarian government he replaced.
   He repeated his promise today to ensure full democracy.
   The opposition, which was discredited by its internal divisions
during the presidential election, is struggling to stage a comeback.
   It has claimed the government won the presidential election by
fraud, but failed to provide evidence.
   Opposition leaders have attacked the Roh government with charges
of corruption after former President Chun's brother was arrested in
March on charges of embezzling millions of dollars.
   The opposition also claims Roh will continue military-backed
rule.
   But the two main opposition parties failed to reunite for the
elections and are again fighting for opposition votes. Both are
determined to emerge as the main opposition force.
   Roh, who promised to root out corruption under the Chun regime,
today said he would keep his promise to end any official abuse of
power and ensure a ``clean government.''

<HEAD>Rare Chicks Hatched In Captivity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two chicks of a bird species found only on
an island off East Africa have been hatched here, wildlife
authorities said.
   The chicks _ Mauritius kestrels _ were displayed Wednesday at
The World Center for Birds of Prey south of Boise.
   One was hatched Tuesday and the other on April 13, are the first
kestrels to be hatched in captivity in the United States, officials
said.
   ``This is a real accomplishment,'' said Bill Burnham, director
of the center.
   He said the birds exist only on the Indian Ocean island of
Mauritius.
   The birds were on the verge of extinction when the Boise-based
Peregrine Fund began studying the species in 1973. Through captive
breeding in Mauritius, the population has grown to more than 70
birds.
   In Mauritius, destruction of the forests in the Black River
Gorge resulted in reduction of the kestrel's favorite food, a
tree-dwelling lizard. It also is located in the middle of a cyclone
belt.
   Kestrel experts like Willard Heck, who is raising the newborns,
said one key to the their survival may lie in forcing them to live
on other islands and to eat a wider variety of food.
   In Idaho, Heck is using forceps to feed the chicks quail that is
ground up like hamburger. The chicks have an excellent chance of
survival, he said.
   Heck hopes to release the kestrels in Mauritius next fall. They
weigh less than an ounce now, and will weigh about half a pound
when fully grown.
   The Peregrine Fund is a non-profit organization founded in 1970.
Known best for its pioneering work in preventing the extinction of
Peregrine falcons, the center has expanded its focus to preserving
raptors worldwide.

<TEXT>
   A whale with a flare for the dramatic wowed
ferry passengers on the San Francisco Bay, blowing air, waving its
tail and diving under the boat.
   The whale _ dubbed by the ferry crew as ``Flukey'' in reference
to the flukes that make up a gray whale's two-pronged tail _ is
thought to be the same young 25-footer seen this week swimming
around Angel Island and away toward Alcatraz Island, ferry
officials said.
   Passengers on the ferry got out of their seats to watch the
orange-brown juvenile whale with a crown of barnacles, as it dived
beneath the boat.
   Mammal experts said it is not unusual for a young gray whale to
cruise the bay this time of year. This ones seems to be lingering
longer than most, however, they said.
   ``We see a whale in the bay probably once every year, but never
one that hangs around this much,'' said Mick Beatie, one of two
captains running the Larkspur Ferry on Wednesday morning. ``That's
the unusual part about it.''
   The whale, estimated to be 5 years old, could have accidentally
come into the bay on an incoming tide or merely been curious, said
Steve Cooper, education director of the Oceanic Society Expeditions
of San Francisco.
   Thousands of gray whales, an endangered species, are in the
midst of a migration from the warm shallow calving lagoons of Baja
California, in Mexico, to the cool waters of Alaska, where they
will feed during the summer.

<DATELINE>THOMASVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has ended its search for two
Marines missing in the Persian Gulf, but relatives of the fliers
say it is difficult for them to give up hope.
   ``It's awful to say we've given up,'' said Bob Hill, father of
Capt. Kenneth Hill. ``At the same time, our son has a 4-year-old
who has to be told something _ and we assume it will be that he's
not going to see his daddy again.
   ``I can't imagine it being a week from now and life could still
be like this. Just how do you live with a story that has no
conclusion?''
   A White House spokesman announced Wednesday that the Navy had
ended its search for Hill, 33, of Thomasville, and Capt. Stephen
Leslie, 30, of New Bern.
   The two offically were declared missing.
   The news came little more than a day after the families of both
men learned they had failed to return from a night patrol mission
in the gulf.
   The two Marines, stationed at New River Air Station, were aboard
an AH-1 Cobra helicopter Monday and were to have returned to the
guided missile cruiser Wainwright following the flight. Iran claims
it shot down the helicopter down, but the Pentagon denies that.
   ``We don't blame anyone for calling off the search,'' Bob Hill
said Wednesday afternoon, as tears welled in his eyes. ``We knew
they couldn't keep nine ships out there endlessly.
   ``But we don't know how people are supposed to get through times
like these. At times we're OK. At other times, we feel like the end
of the world has come.''
   ``We're just holding on to faith that Stephen and Ken (Hill)
will be home soon,'' Kenneth Hill's wife, Lora, said. ``We love him
and we want him to come home. But sometimes we don't always get
what we want.''
   A member of the Leslie family, meanwhile, was feeling a mixture
of sorrow and pride.
   ``He told the family if he ever got lost or didn't come back to
remember that he was doing what he wanted to do, and to hold on to
that thought,'' said Leslie's younger sister, 24-year-old Kris.
   ``The waiting has been the worst part. ... We are a close-knit
family and we are banding together,'' Ms. Leslie said.
   Leslie and his wife, Lisa, live in Jacksonville and the couple
is expecting its first child, Ms. Leslie said.
   ``We're very numb right now,'' Ms. Leslie said.

   The toughest battlefield in the war on
AIDS will be Africa, but the last skirmishes may be fought in the
back alleys where drug addicts congregate, the head of the World
Health Organization says.
   ``A health problem is never just a medical problem,'' Dr.
Halfdan T. Mahler, director-general of WHO, said in an interview.
``AIDS is just as much a political problem. It's a social problem.
It's an economic problem.''
   Mahler, a craggy-featured Dane, speaks of fighting disease with
a missionary zeal. He says he refuses to be daunted by the
challenge of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``If you get overwhelmed, then you lose your imagination,'' he
said during a visit to U.N. headquarters this week.
   The Geneva-based WHO estimates there are about 150,000 cases of
AIDS worldwide and an additional 5 million to 10 million people
infected with the AIDS virus. It says 129 countries have reported
the disease.
   Mahler said AIDS is spreading fast in urban Africa south of the
Sahara, a region where economic problems have made even the fight
against curable diseases difficult.
   ``Africa has been more underprivileged and more overtraumatized
by history than any other place,'' Mahler said. ``Obviously it is a
continent where development has gone wrong. But I take AIDS as a
challenge in this difficult situation.''
   There is no known cure or vaccine for AIDS, a viral disease that
destroys the body's immune system and leaves victims susceptible to
a wide variety of infections and cancers. It is spread through
sexual contact, tainted blood, sharing of contaminated hypodermic
needles or syringes by drug abusers, or passed on by infected
mothers to their children at or before birth.
   Mahler praised the efforts of sub-Saharan nations to develop
national programs against AIDS with the help of WHO.
   ``We have truely been able to set in motion programs that, I
believe, in spite of the absence of vaccines and drugs, will bear
fruit over the next four, five, six years,'' he said.
   Intravenous drug abusers, however, may prove to be the most
intractable problem, he said, partly because they tend to be
self-destructive and are less likely to take the kinds of
precautions that can stem AIDS. Compounding the problem is the
worldwide failure to curb drug use, he said.
   ``We have been doing very badly with the IV drug users,'' Mahler
said.
   Mahler said his attitude toward AIDS has changed dramatically.
   ``I had not realized in the first few years that it had the
explosive potential that it has,'' he acknowledged.
   Two years ago he was criticized for saying AIDS was getting
undue attention in comparison to the millions of children who die
every year of curable or preventable diseases like malaria,
measles, whooping cough or simple diarrhea.
   Now Mahler says he regards AIDS as the most serious health
problem confronting the world. He said that in the past year WHO
has intensified its efforts against the disease, trying to
coordinate a global strategy to check AIDS.
   ``We know it is exploding in many parts of Africa. We know it is
exploding in many parts of Central America, the Caribbean and Latin
American countries. We know that it is also starting to explode
among certain IV drug users in certain Asian countries,'' he said.
   ``It makes you very nervous.''

<HEAD>Preliminary Test Results Show Tumors In Mice, EPA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says
preliminary results from new tests show that a controversial
chemical used to regulate the growth of apples does cause tumors in
mice.
   But EPA Assistant Administrator John A. Moore, in an Arpil 8
letter to the International Apple Institute, said the agency does
not yet have enough information to make a decision on what to do.
   However Moore said in the letter, obtained by The Associated
Press on Wednesday, that a decision could be announced as early as
fall on whether to ban use of the chemical.
   The chemical, daminozide had been used on about 40 percent of
the nation's apple crop. Applied in the summer, it slows growth,
makes apples ripen together, deepens color and lengthens storage
life.
   The agency began studying daminozide in 1980 and proposed to ban
it in 1985, but decided to order new studies when its own
scientific advisers said it had not proved its case. It did lower
the permissible residues in apples and the amount that may be used
in orchards.
   ``I hope that it is clear from the information provided in this
letter that we do not yet have enough information'' to decide what
to do about daminozide, Moore wrote.
   Uniroyal Chemical Co. of Middlebury, Conn., which manufactures
daminozide has told apple growers it remains confident that the
chemical, sold under the trade name Alar, eventually will be
cleared.

   Grocery shoppers will be able to get
rainchecks or substitutes from their supermarkets on advertised
items, under a new Federal Trade Commission rule.
   Although those are common practices of many businesses, they
have technically been illegal for supermarkets a under rule adopted
in 1971.
   Super markets were expected to have enough stock on hand of
advertised items to meet ``reasonably anticipated demand'' and
could have been fined before the FTC rule change.
   The commission voted 3-2 Wednesday to amend that rule to permit
grocers to offer rainchecks or to substitute items if they run out.
   In addition, if grocers want to advertise something they know is
in limited supply, they would be allowed to clearly state in the
ads that supplies are limited.

   The House Foreign Affairs subcommittee has
unanimously approved a bill that would allow U.S. residents who are
victims of torture overseas to seek civil damages in federal court.
   All torture victims, either foreign aliens or American citizens,
living in the United States would be covered once they had
exhausted all legal remedies in the country where the torture
occurred.
   The families of victims of political killings also would be
entitled to seek damages under the bill.
   Persons who actually committed or ordered torture or political
killings could be sued if they visit the United States.
   The measure, sponsored chiefly by Reps. Gus Yatron, D-Pa., Peter
W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., and Jim Leach, R-Iowa, has been endorsed by
the American Bar Association and Amnesty International USA, which
told a March 23 subcommittee hearing the bill would help deter the

<HEAD>New AIDS Data May Show Spread In Asia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new report shows AIDS is ``smoldering'' in
Asia, according to the Agency for International Development.
   Dr. Jeffrey Harris, the agency's AIDS coordinator, said at a
congressional hearing on Wednesday, that new data received earlier
this week from the World Health Organization on intravenous drug
users in Bangkok, Thailand, put their infection rate at 16 percent
in the first three months of this year.
   The same group had only a 1 percent infection rate last year,
said Harris.
   ``There's a fire raging in the Caribbean,'' Harris said. ``It's
smoldering in Latin America and it may be beginning to smolder in
Asia.''
   Bradshaw Langmaid, chairman of the agency's working group on
AIDS cited prostitutes who are often the sexual partners of addicts
in Thailand, a favorite vacation spot for many people in Asia, as
the likely spreaders of the deadly immune system disease.
   In a statement submitted to the foreign operations subcommittee
of the House Appropriations Committee, Langmaid said, ``in general,
Asian governments view AIDS as a less urgent problem and have moved
more slowly to undertake AIDS prevention and control efforts.''

<DATELINE>LOS MOCHIS, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of police today surrounded a
bank in northwestern Mexico where six gunmen held more than 40
customers and employees captive after four hostages were killed and
about 10 wounded.
   The gunmen, who were caught robbing the bank Wednesday,
threatened to kill their hostages unless they allowed to travel to
a nearby airport and leave on a plane, said Ignacio Lara, spokesman
for the Sinaloa state governor.
   Authorities gave conflicting accounts about how the casualties
occurred. One official said they occurred in a shootout with
police. Another said the gunmen shot the hostages inside the bank.
   The standoff in this coastal Gulf of California city of 120,000
began at 12:45 p.m. Wednesday (3:45 p.m. EDT) after the gunmen
burst into the Banamex bank and an alarm alerted police to the
robbery, said Ramiro Guerrero, news editor at the Noroeste
newspaper in the state capital of Culiacan.
   One of two police officers inside conducting business, Roberto
Soto Cruz, tried to prevent the robbery and was shot, Lara said.
The other officer apparently was disarmed by the robbers, the
spokesman said.
   The gunmen then attempted to leave the surrounded bank, using
Soto and at least one customer as a shield, said Guerrero, who was
on the scene.
   The customer, Marco Antonio Estrada, was killed and Soto
received more wounds when the escape attempt led to a gun battle
between police and the robbers in which ``nine or 10'' hostages
were wounded, according to Lara.
   It was not clear if the wounded were still among the hostages,
he said.
   Soto died at a hospital after the gunmen allowed Red Cross
officials to escort him from the building, Guerrero said.
   The other two people killed were identified as Manuel Andoval
Rendon, a bank official who died of a gunshot wound to the chest,
and cashier Rosi Maria Padilla, 22, who was reported shot in the
face.
   Lara said the two were killed during the escape attempt.
However, Guerrero said they were shot earlier by the gunmen. Lara
said authorities believed there were 59 hostages inside the bank.
   Hector Paliza, another spokesman for the Sinaloa state
government, gave a different account of the incident.
   He said the gunmen became angry after the bank alarm was
sounded, shot and killed three people inside the bank, fatally
wounded Soto, who died later in a hospital, and shot and wounded
about 10 of the hostages.
   The gunmen then tried to escape through a bank window but were
repelled by police gunfire, Paliza said. He added the gunmen
released the wounded and were still holding about 40 people inside
the bank building.
   Lara said police were negotiating with the gunmen by telephone,
but refusing to give in to their demands for safe passage to the
airport.
   Alfredo Lopez, assistant commander of the federal judicial
police in Sinaloa state, said authorities would permit the gunmen
to leave the building only ``with their hands raised and if they
respect the lives of the hostages.''
   The six made telephone calls to state Gov. Francisco Labastida
Ochoa and the Mexican TV network Televisa demanding to be allowed
to leave the site.
   More than 1,000 municipal and judicial police backed by fire
apparatus had cordoned off several blocks surrounding the bank
building, Guerrero said. Los Mochis is about 500 miles south of
Tuscon, Ariz.

   A huge storm system produced scattered showers and mountain
snowfall across the West today after pelting California with hail
and stirring up damaging winds.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered late Wednesday from
western Oregon into the central California valleys. Southern
California had localized flooding Wednesday and was expected to
receive 1 to 2 inches of rain overnight.
   A combination of rain and glare from the setting sun caused a
39-car accident on the Pomona Freeway Wednesday that injured 19
motorists, one seriously, in the City of Industry, 25 miles east of
Los Angeles.
   A funnel cloud or tornado tore up the roof of a home, uprooted
trees and hurled a refrigerator from a porch into a ditch Wednesday
in Bear Valley, northwest of Los Angeles.
   Snow was expected to continue falling today in the mountains of
Southern California, with 4 to 8 inches expected down to elevations
of 5,000 feet. Late Wednesday, when snow was limited mostly to
elevations greater than 6,000 feet, Big Bear measured 5 inches of
new snow and Mount Wilson and Lake Arrowhead reported nearly 3
inches.
   The storm system causing the rain and snow extended from the
central coastal states into the Pacific west of Baja California.
   Showers and a few isolated thunderstorms occurred from the
northern Plateau region into northern Arizona. Wind gusts of 54
miles per hour were clocked at Lander, Wyo., Wednesday evening as
showers moved into the area.
   A winter storm warning for as much as a foot of snow continued
this morning for elevations above 6,500 feet in northern Arizona.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered early this morning
across much of South Dakota into the Nebraska panhandle.
   Rain showers were also scattered from the eastern Great Lakes
and upper Ohio Valley to the middle Atlantic Coast.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included more than a half-inch at Cedar City, Utah, and more than a
third of an inch at Salem, Ore.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms in
Nebraska, South Dakota and much of the area west of the Rockies,
with snow in higher elevations; widely scattered thunderstorms in
eastern Oklahoma; and scattered showers in Kentucky, northern
Tennessee, eastern New York state and New England.
   Highs were expected in the 50s or 60s across most of the nation,
except 70s or 80s in the Southeast and from the southern Plains to
southeast New Mexico, 90s in western Texas, 40s or lower along the
Canadian border from New England to Montana and 30s or 40s in
northern Arizona.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 22
degrees at Sawyer Air Force Base near Marquette, Mich., to 76
degrees at Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>Alarms And Tension As U.S. Awaits Possible Iranian Attacks</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABOARD USS JACK WILLIAMS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Occasional alarms and tension
kept sailors alert aboard this guided-missile frigate in the
Persian Gulf as the United States waited for signs of new Iranian
attacks.
   Senior officers analyzed the tactical and technical data still
flowing in on Monday's battles with Iran in the gulf. Meanwhile, a
search was called off for a U.S. Marine helicopter carrying a
two-man crew that vanished hours after the day-long exchange of
gunfire on Monday had ended.
   Officers on the Jack Williams, flagship for one of the three
surface action groups of three ships each, said there was nothing
to support Iran's claim that the AH-1 Cobra gunship was shot down.
   It was the third U.S. helicopter lost in the gulf since July
1987, when the Reagan administration began providing naval escort
for 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers re-registered under the Stars and
Stripes for protection from Iranian attack.
   The 200-plus crew members of the Jack Williams were still
putting things back in order _ cleaning equipment, weapons and
passageways _ in the wake of Monday's action.
   In the course of it, Iran fired five missiles at the Jack
Williams and two destroyers sailing with it. Navy officers said
they were Chinese-made Silkworm missiles fired from anti-ship
batteries along the Strait of Hormuz for the first time. The
Pentagon said it had not determined what type of missile was fired.
All five missiles went awry, their guidance systems confused by
aluminum chaff fired into the air by the U.S. ships.
   The 3,700-ton frigate, operating in the southern gulf, remained
at Condition 1-Alpha, the second-highest level of alert in the
Navy, below General Quarters.
   The Williams' skipper, Cmdr. Edward Mann, 42, of Bucks County,
Pa. said: ``We can do this for a month if necessary, because we
have trained, organized and planned to do it _ we came here ready
for the long haul.''
   An alarm sounded at midmorning Wednesday when the ship's radar
picked up a signal that the Combat Information Center evaluated as
a Sea Hunter radar system, one that Iran is known to possess and
that can be used to locate a missile target.
   Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke, a spokesman for the Navy's Joint Task
Force Middle East, said the radar twitch would be analyzed to
determine where it originated.
   The missile destroyer Joseph Strauss and the destroyer O'Brien
are also part of Desron 22, the Destroyer Squadron Command aboard
this warship. O'Brien's home port is San Diego, Strauss is based at
Pearl Harbor.
   Also Wednesday, the Jack Williams warned off an Iranian C-130
aircraft, whose pilot at first ignored the ship's radioed
challenges and then answered by saying: ``We are an Iranian
warplane, doing our duty.''
   A voice, speaking accented english, then said: ``Martyr, do your
duty.''
   Minutes after the C-130 landed at Iran's nearby Abu Musa Island,
the frigate went to General Quarters as a precaution against the
possibility that a canister of CS, a non-lethal type of riot
control gas, had been dropped in the area. A team checked the ship,
and found no indications any such canister had been dropped.
   The ship also received brief reports of Iranian speedboats
attacking commercial vessels in the Strait of Hormuz and the
discovery of two floating mines, apparently by the French navy
farther north.
   British and Italian minesweepers also were understood to be
taking part in mine-hunting operations in international waters of
the central gulf.
   Capt. Donald Dyer, commander of Desron 22, said the mines
apparently were floating rather than moored, and were found 70
miles southwest of where the U.S. guided-missile frigate Samuel B.
Roberts was severely damaged last week.
   The United States accused Iran of laying the mine that damaged
the Roberts and retaliated by shelling two Iranian oil platforms.
After that, Iranian attack boats went on a rampage and U.S. naval
forces and neutral shipping. U.S. forces sank or damaged six
Iranian warships.
   The Jack Williams crew on Wednesday hashed over the events, the
first combat experience for all expect the captain, Cmdr. Edward
Mann, and Master Chief Petty Officer Joseph Johnson.
   The crewmen, whose average age is about 22, appeared generally
united in believing that the U.S. action against Iran was proper.
   ``Nobody wants to kill people but you can't just let them run
over everybody,'' said Petty Officer 2nd class Larry Doyle, 20, of
Zanesville, Ohio.
   Doyle, the ship's storekeeper, was a communications man on the
bridge throughout those hectic hours, when missiles left the sky
criss-crossed with trails and deck officers shouted ``Silkworm
inbound!'' as the lumbering projectiles were spotted visually or by
electronic means.
   Also on the bridge was Seaman Edwin Rivera, 25, who lives with
his wife in Mayport, Fla., home port of the Jack Williams.
   Rivera, who keeps a diary of everything that has happened on his
frigate's gulf excursion, said the situation was scary. ``But the
worst was when our own missile was fired and we didn't know it was
going to happen. it took everybody by surprise,'' he said.
   Gunner's Mate David Talbert, 18, said he was manning the
Williams' 76-mm deck gun during the excitement and found it ``the
same as always when we're at General Quarters.
   ``But there's a helpless feeling in there _ not knowing what's
going on is worse than something happening,'' said Talbert, whose
class at Northwestern High School in Springfield, Ohio, will
graduate in June.
   Some sailors asked members of a Pentagon news media pool aboard
the frigate to let their relatives in the United States know that
they were all right.
   ``That's the most important thing, to let them know that,'' said
Doyle.

   The death of an American engineer killed in
Nicaragua was unfortunate but justifiable, a Contra spokeswoman
said after the man's family filed a $50 million wrongful death
lawsuit against the rebels.
   Benjamin Linder, 27, was fatally shot April 28, 1987, when
Contra troops attacked the small hydroelectric project that the
Portland, Ore., man was helping to build in northern Nicaragua.
   ``He was killed during an ambush that took place in a highly
active war zone,'' said Marta Sacasa, a spokeswoman for the
Nicaraguan Resistance based here.
   Named as defendants in the federal suit filed earlier Wednesday
are the Nicaraguan Resistance; Adolfo Calero and Aristides Sanchez,
directors of the umbrella organization; and military leaders
Enrique Bermudez and Indalecio Rodriguez.
   ``They wounded Ben and then shot him through the head at
point-blank range,'' said Linder's mother, Elisabeth Linder. ``This
is an act of murder and those responsible should pay for their
crimes.''
   But Ms. Sacasa said the Nicaraguan government is responsible for
Linder's death because it allowed him to go into an area that was
obviously dangerous. She also said that Linder, armed and dressed
in a uniform, was with Sandinistas when he was fatally shot.
   These factors make the attack during which he was killed
legitimate, said Ms. Sacasa, who added that ``Benjamin Linder's
death is being used by his family'' for political propaganda.
   Linder's father, Dr. David Linder, said his son's death ``was no
accident. ... He and his co-workers were targeted by the Contras
because they were bringing electricity to poor Nicaraguans.''
   The suit was referred to U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus, but
no hearing has been set.

<HEAD>House Of Commons Suspends Maverick Legislator For 20 Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Commons barred a militant Scottish
member from the next 20 working days of Commons business for
damaging the 16th-century staff that symbolizes the speaker's
authority.
   Legislators voted 463-26 Wednesday night to suspend Ron Brown, a
left-wing member of the socialist opposition Labor Party.
   Brown grabbed the ornate 5-foot-long mace in the Commons on
Monday night and dropped it in front of the sergeant-at-arms in an
angry protest over government cuts in welfare payments.
   The suspension vote followed Brown's refusal Tuesday to read out
a formal statement of apology for his behavior.
   Earlier Wednesday, the Labor Party hierarchy voted to ostracize
Brown from any role in party activities for three months. It is the
first time in 21 years that Labor leaders have taken such action.
   The decision must be approved by a ballot of Labor's 229 elected
representatives. Their decision takes effect only when Brown
returns from any suspension agreed by the Commons.
   ``The whole thing is a storm in a tea cup,'' the 47-year-old
Brown told reporters before the vote. ``I have a job of work to do,
and I will still do it even if I am suspended.''
   At the end of debate Monday night, Brown marched from his seat
in the back benches on to the floor of the Commons, threw papers in
the face of a junior government minister, then picked up the
16-pound mace from its resting place at the foot of the table
behind which Commons officers sit.
   What happened next is disputed.
   The Times of London and other news media witnesses said Brown
threw the mace on the floor, causing an estimated $1,890 worth of
damage to the silver-gilt staff, before storming out of the
chamber. Brown says he accidentally dropped the mace.
   The mace is officially part of the Crown Jewels. Its presence in
the Commons indicates the legislative body is in session.
   News reports said Labor Party Leader Neil Kinnock is exasperated
that the antics of rebel Laborites are distracting attention from
Labor's attacks on government moves to reform the post-World War II
welfare benefits system.
   Brown and other militants have vowed to use ``guerrilla
tactics'' to disrupt the Commons, in which Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's Conservatives have a comfortable majority of 102.
   Unruly legislators now routinely hurl insults at each other and
shout down opponents, ignoring appeals for order from Speaker
Bernard Weatherill.
   Last month, Weatherill banned a Scottish National Party
legislator for five days for screaming abuse that caused an
unprecedented suspension of budget day proceedings.
   The uproar was prompted by the government's announcement that it
was slashing income tax for top wage earners from 60 to 40 percent.

   Paramilitary rangers accidentally set
off a phosphorus bomb on a passenger bus in northeastern Thailand,
killing at least 22 people and seriously injuring 20, police said
today.
   Among the dead was a 2-year-old girl, they said.
   Col. Sittisak Intomya, provincial police commander, said five
rangers seated at the rear of the bus ignored pleas from other
passengers to put away the bomb as the bus traveled in Nonsoong
district, 200 miles northeast of Bangkok. He gave no details on how
the bomb was detonated, but said the men were believed to have come
from Pakthongchai ranger base.
   The colonel quoted witnesses as saying one ranger escaped after
the explosion. He did not specify if the other rangers were killed
in the blast.
   Phosphorus is poisonous and mixes easily with oxygen and ignites
spontaneously at room temperature.

Finds</HEAD>

   Immigrant schoolchildren are hampered by rigid
placement practices, lack of bilingual education, cultural
insensitivity, harassment from other students and fear of
deportation, a new study says.
   Such children often are placed in classes for the handicapped or
at inappropriate grade levels because schools can't cope with their
cultural differences, according to the study released Wednesday.
   This is true even though ``the education level of many new
immigrants ... is superior to that of previous migrations'' and
sometimes exceeds that of Americans, added the 129-page study,
titled ``New Voices: Immigrant Students in the U.S. Public
Schools.''
   The study was conducted by the Boston-based National Coalition
of Advocates for Students and funded largely by the Ford Foundation.
   The Supreme Court has ruled that all school-age immigrants are
entitled to an education, regardless of whether they are here
legally, the study noted.
   About 6.6 million people immigrated to the United States in the
1970s, more than two-thirds of them legally, forming one of the
largest migrations in U.S. history and one that is continuing, the
study said.
   Newcomers arriving now are primarily from Asia, Mexico, Central
and South America and the Caribbean, it said. Immigrant children,
who number up to 2.7 million, comprise about 6 percent of total
U.S. public school enrollment.
   After conducting public hearings in six ``gateway cities'' for
immigrants and after interviewing parents and educators across the
country, researchers reported that schools are doing a poor job of
meeting immigrant students' needs.
   Some areas of the country are fostering an ``English Only'' or
``English First'' movement, undercutting public funding for
educational programs serving students who speak little or no
English, the study said.
   The movement ``sends a clear message to newcomers that their
languages and cultures are unwelcome and inferior _ a point of view
which ill prepares this country for the realities of its domestic
and international future,'' it said.
   Dropout rates for immigrant students are high, suicide attempts
are all too frequent and some young newcomers under extreme
pressure have responded by forming gangs for emotional and physical
protection, the study found.
   Though the study could provide no figures on how often immigrant
children are misclassified into special education programs with
physically and mentally handicapped youngsters, it apparently has
happened frequently, the authors said.
   As far back as 1916, special classes ``frequently served as an
easy means of disposing of a (non-English speaking) pupil who,
through no fault of his own, is an unsatisfactory member of a
regular class,'' the study said.
   Reine Leroy, an intergrou relations representative from Dade
County, Fla., told the researchers, ``Teachers thought that these
kids were dumb, that they could not learn.''
   The study suggested restructuring public schools to better
assess immigrant students for placement in appropriate grades,
boosting the quality of bilingual education and providing
counseling and support geared specifically to immigrants.

   The dollar opened firmer against major foreign
currencies in Europe today and was holding steady in early trading,
dealers said. Gold prices fell.
   European dealers said there were no fundamental reasons for the
dollar's rebound, although they said the U.S. currency was getting
some support from fears that central banks would step in to stop
any slide.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.40 yen to a closing 124.30. Later, it was also
quoted at 124.30 yen in London.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday:
   _ 1.6682 West German marks, up from 1.6635
   _ 1.3780 Swiss francs, up from 1.3745
   _ 5.6660 French francs, up from 5.6490
   _ 1.8715 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8630
   _ 1,240.25 Italian lire, up from 1,234.50
   _ 1.2302 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2283
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8872, cheaper for buyers
than $1.8930 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $453.50 a troy ounce and
at midmorning the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
slightly higher recommended price of $454. Late Wednesday's bid
price was $456.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $454.80, down from 457.50 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.04 to close at a bid $454.90.
   Silver was quoted in London Thursday at a bid price of $6.43 a
troy ounce, down from Wednesday's $6.46.

   Israelis celebrated their country's 40th
anniversary under tight security today, and Arabs threw a homemade
explosive at soldiers in Bethlehem during PLO-ordered ``Firebomb
Day'' in the occupied lands.
   For a second day, the army barred the 1.5 million Palestinians
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip from entering Israel to
prevent disturbances. It also barred journalists from most of the
territories, where curfews were maintained over 23 refugee camps
and towns for a fifth day. All told, more than 400,000 Arabs were
living under curfew.
   In a special Independence Day interview, Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir said nearly five months of anti-occupation violence appeared
to be winding down and called on Arab activists to stop the rioting.
   Shamir told Israel radio that Palestinian leaders' heads were
``in the clouds. Their demands have reached the skies.''
   According to U.N. figures, 169 Arabs have died since the
uprising began 19 weeks ago in the territories Israel seized in the
1967 Middle East war. Two Israelis also have been killed.
   Despite the unrest, Israelis marked the holiday with picnics,
hikes through the countryside and visits to army bases specially
opened to the public.
   In Jerusalem, President Chaim Herzog held a reception for
veterans of the 1948 war in which Israel won its independence.
   The 24-hour Independence Day festivities were launched on
Wednesday night with a torch-lighting ceremony at Jerusalem's Mount
Herzl.
   Hundreds of thousands of Israelis then took to the streets to
sing, dance and watch fireworks. In keeping with tradition, youths
knocked passers-by over the head with plastic hammers and sprayed
them with a dry foam.
   One of the highlights was a military show at Ramat Gan Stadium
near Tel Aviv featuring parachute jumps, fighter jets, tanks and
fireworks. It was the first display of armaments since 1973. Israel
has tended to refrain from such exhibits to avoid emphasizing the
role of wars in its history.
   Hundreds of soldiers patrolled the West Bank today, including 16
soldiers outside the Dheishe refugee camp on Bethlehem's outskirts.
Israelis were warned to be on the alert for suspicious objects
during the holiday.
   Most Palestinians stayed off the job, observing a general strike
call from the Palestine Liberation Organization and underground
leaders.
   They had also been asked to throw firebombs at Israeli soldiers
and in Bethlehem, Palestinians hurled a gasoline bomb at an Israeli
patrol.
   Troops responded with rubber bullets, breaking all the windows
in one home, according to an AP reporter at the scene. The soldiers
also fired live rounds into the air and lobbed tear gas canisters.
   On Wednesday, underground leaders issued leaflet No. 14, which
called on Palestinians to mark last week's assassination of PLO
military commander Khalil Wazir with strikes and demonstrations.
   Tunisian authorities and Israeli sources say he was killed by
Israeli commandos. The Israeli government refused comment.
   The killing caused violent protests on Saturday during which
Israeli soldiers shot and killed 17 Palestinians, the highest death
toll for a single day since the uprising began.
   Another Palestinian was shot to death Wednesday and 10 wounded
in protests that defied curfews in effect since Saturday.
   Leaflet No. 14 bore a picture of Wazir and contained a pledge to
him to ``follow your path until the flag to which you dedicated
your life will be raised over Jerusalem, the capital of our
independent Palestinian state.''
   It also called for a general strike on April 28 to protest the
deportation of Palestinian activists. Since Dec. 8, Israel has
expelled 20 alleged Palestinian agitators to Lebanon.
   On Wednesday, the army established a new prison for Arab
detainees north of Jerusalem to help incarcerate the 5,000
Palestinians arrested since the uprising began.
   If was the fifth new Israeli prison established since the
uprising began, according to the Palestinian human rights group Law
in the Service of Man.

   An apparently flawless test-firing of
the space shuttle's redesigned booster rocket has improved the odds
of NASA meeting its goal of resuming manned space flight in
mid-August, officials say.
   Wednesday's two-minute firing of the 126-foot rocket went
smoothly, but spokesmen for NASA and Morton Thiokol, which
manufactures the booster, say it will take a week to 10 days to
verify the test was a success.
   A cursory inspection of the rocket afterward indicated the
redesigned seals in the booster's joints prevented an escape of hot
gases despite deliberately built-in flaws.
   ``It's a happy day for a lot of people,'' said Royce Mitchell,
solid rocket program manager for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. ``So far, it looks excellent.''
   In a post-test briefing, Alan McDonald, Morton Thiokol vice
president for engineering, displayed a graph on which nearly
identical curves compared engineers' predictions with a preliminary
test evaluation taken from electronic monitors.
   ``Unless you're about only eight millimeters away, you can't
tell any difference,'' McDonald said.
   Barring discovery of problems as the rocket is dismantled,
Wednesday's success means Morton Thiokol must conduct only two more
full-scale tests, in June and July, before NASA can proceed with an
August launch of the shuttle Discovery.
   It would be America's first manned space flight since the
shuttle Challenger exploded 70 seconds after liftoff on Jan. 28,
1986, killing seven crew members.
   ``It's like finally winning the quarterfinals of the NCAA,''
McDonald said of the test.
   The critical concern is whether super-hot gases escaped the
flawed seals. A presidential commission blamed the Challenger
disaster on a joint between segments of the booster rocket whose
seals failed, allowing gases to escape and ignite the space craft's
exterior fuel tank.
   Since then, engineers have added a third O-ring to the seals and
a metal lip, or capture feature, to contain gases that may leak
around the joints linking the four segments of the rocket.
   The case-to-nozzle joint also has been strengthened with 100
radial bolts to prevent vibration during launch, part of a redesign
planned before the Challenger exploded. This joint attaches the
nozzle to the aft segment.
   In the middle joint, engineers left a gap one-tenth of an inch
wide between two sections of insulation to see if it would seal
itself, under pressure from the expanding gases, as it has in
short-duration tests.
   A second flaw was placed in the adhesive binding insulation
inside the case-to-nozzle joint. A tiny ``blowhole'' was created to
allow gases to reach the ``wiper'' O-ring, which was installed as
part of the new design to keep the adhesive in place. However, it
also acts as an additional seal to protect the primary and
secondary O-rings. In the short-duration tests, gases have hit the
wiper ring but have not gone past it.
   McDonald said the flaws were more severe than anything likely to
occur during manufacture or assembly.
   ``It is, indeed, a fail-safe. If at any time gas gets beyond the
point we expect it to, the joint still is going to perform,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Mexican Journalists Outraged By Killing Of Newspaper Columnist</HEAD>

   Mexican journalists say the shotgun
slaying of a satirical columnist is part of a pattern of
intimidation, and a colleague said he might ask Mexico's federal
government to take over the investigation.
   Hector Felix Miranda, the 47-year-old co-editor of Zeta, was
killed while driving to work Wednesday morning, said District
Attorney Francisco Dominguez.
   Police said they had not determined a motive.
   According to a spokesman for the state prosecutor's office in
Tijuana, a brown pickup truck with a camper shell pulled alongside
Felix's car. Shots were fired from an automatic 12-gauge shotgun.
   ``This cowardly act increases the climate of insecurity in which
Tijuana journalists live,'' said Enrique Garca Sanchez, city editor
of Tijuana's oldest daily, El Heraldo. He said he would go to
Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid if state investigators do not
solve the case.
   Five Mexican journalists have been killed this year, and 35 have
been killed in the past decade.
   Last year, Zeta's offices were sprayed with bullets from a
passing car. No one was injured and police never found those
responsible.
   Herman Baca, president of the San Diego-based Committee on
Chicano Rights, said Wednesday a letter asking for an investigation
into the slaying was being sent to de la Madrid.
   ``This assassination poses the greatest threat to freedom of the
press in Mexico,'' Baca said. ``There's been a large number of
other journalists who have met a similar fate, and it's obvious
that it has become a pattern to silence the independent press in
Mexico.''
   Jesus Blancornelas, who co-founded the weekly Zeta with Felix in
1980, speculated that the killing was an act of political revenge.
   ``The government said that it respects freedom of expression and
that the police are among the most advanced,'' Blancornelas said.
``We hope that both those things might be demonstrated.''
   Felix, known as ``Felix the Cat,'' wrote for the weekly Zeta,
which has a circulation of 60,000 throughout Baja California. His
column, ``A Little Bit of Something,'' often accused government
officials and business people of arrogant behavior.
   ``He was a satirist. He was very well-known and popular here in
the state,'' said Miguel Cervantes, a writer for Zeta. Cervantes
said Felix had no known enemies and called the shooting ``an act of
cowards'' aimed at muzzling the press.
   Felix's murder follows by two months the still-unsolved slaying
of Manuel Burgueno Orduno, editor of the monthly political magazine
Deslinde, in the Baja California coastal resort city of Mazatlan.

   A pro-Iranian underground group said
today it will try Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins on charges of
spying.
   ``This criminal will be turned over today to the tribunal of the
oppressed to try him for the crimes he has committed,'' said a
type-written statement signed the Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth.
   The Arabic-language statement was accompanied by a
black-and-white photograph of Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky. Higgins
was serving with a U.N. observer group in south Lebanon when he was
kidnapped Feb. 17.
   The picture showed the balding Higgins with a stubbled gray
beard grown in captivity, wearing a dark field jacket, his eyes
looking down and away from the camera.
   It was the first photograph of Higgins released by his captors
since he was kidnapped near the ancient port of Tyre. It was not
known when it was taken.
   The captors released a videotape on Feb. 22 in which Higgins
pleaded with President Reagan to meet the demands they made for his
release.
   Today's statement was the fourth from the group since Higgins
was abducted. It was delivered to the office of the British news
agency Reuters.
   On Monday, Beirut's Christian-run Voice of Lebanon radio station
claimed Higgins had been killed by his abductors during clashes
between pro-Syrian and Iranian-backed Shiite militias in south
Lebanon.
   The statement said the kidnappers had completed an investigation
of Higgins' activities in Lebanon.
   It said among the charges he faced was ``spying for the criminal
United States on our Lebanese and Palestinian peoples'' and
``active participation in American conspiracies against our Moslem
people.''
   The statement also said Higgins was accused of supervising a
``Pentagon team to combat Lebanese and Palestinian Islamic
organizations in Palestine and Lebanon.'' The statement said
Higgins was charged with ``collecting information and reporting to
the Pentagon about the military and political situation in south
Lebanon.''
   It claimed he was a member of what it called an American
ccoordination committee ``on Lebanon and Palestine'' made up of
officials from the Defense Department, the State Department and the
Central Intelligence Agency.
   The wife of American hostage Alann Steen sent her husband good
wishes for his 49th birthday in an advertisement published by the
independent An-Nahar daily newspaper.
   ``Dearest Alann,'' said the published note from Virginia Rose
Steen, 30, of Jackson, Mich. ``We love you dearly. We are working
and hoping with others that you will be with us again soon.''
   The note assured him his two daughters were fine in the United
States.
   Steen, a native of Boston, was a communications instructor at
the U.S.-affiliated Beirut University College when he was kidnapped
with two other American professors and an Indian educator Jan. 24,
1987. His wife also works at the college.
   Twenty-two foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing and
presumed kidnapped in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry A.
Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, who was seized March 16, 1985.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Earth has apparently been spared the worst
effects of the El Nino weather phenomenon, with the most recent of
these events coming to a close after a fairly docile stay.
   Droughts in India and the Pacific Northwest were reported, as
well as unusually heavy rains in portions of South America, which
scientists have associated with the El Nino which began in 1986.
   By contrast, the 1982-83 El Nino disrupted weather around much
of the world, eventually being blamed for 1,500 deaths and damage
totaling between $2 billion and $8 billion.
   Vernon E. Kousky of the federal Climate Analysis Center in Camp
Springs, Md., confirmed Wednesday that Pacific Ocean surface
temperatures _ a prime gauge of El Nino events _ have returned to
near normal.
   An El Nino is considered underway when water temperatures rise
one-half degree to one degree Celsius above normal in the western
Pacific, Kousky said. Currently, these temperatures have dropped
back to normal or even a bit below, he said.
   Since climate conditions change only gradually, another El Nino
is unlikely for at least two years. Indeed, it may be as long as
four or five years, Kousky said in a telephone interview.
   In the meantime he has halted the monthly ``diagnostic
advisories'' issued by his office on the event, known by scientists
as the ENSO, for El Nino-Southern Oscillation.
   ``Low-level ... winds, sea surface temperatures, sea level
pressure and central Pacific atmospheric convection indicate a
return to non-ENSO conditions,'' Kousky reported in his final
advisory.
   The name El Nino (pronounced ``el neen'-yo'') was applied by
South American fishermen, who notice the event because it reduces
the fish catch when water temperatures change. The change usually
is first noticable around Christmastime, so the fishermen applied
the Spanish name for child, referring to the Christ Child.
   Southern Oscillation is a term used by scientists, referring to
changes in air pressure over the tropical Pacific Ocean.
   Only in recent years have researchers determined that the two
events are interconnected _ thus the combined name now in use.
   In a normal El Nino year there is a weakening of the Indian
Monsoon, which occurred last summer, along with reductions in
rainfall in such areas as Indonesia, the Philippines and several
Pacific Islands.
   In addition, the El Nino weather patterns last year blocked the
normal movement of storms in the northern Pacific Ocean, pushing
them northward into Alaska and northern British Columbia and
apparently leading to a drought in the Pacific Northwest. Warm
weather in the western states and wetness in the Southeast are
common when El Nino occurs.
   Thus, the wet winter in the Southeast in 1986-87 may also have
been related to the event.
   These changes are what one would expect in an El Nino, Kousky
has said. By comparison, ``the 1982-83 one was unusual in that the
weather changes were disasterous'' worldwide, Kousky noted.
   That event was extraordinarily severe, while the one just ending
was more like other recent El Nino events, such as those of 1957,
1963, 1965, 1969, 1972-73, 1975 and 1976.
   While scientists are still trying to determine what causes these
periodic events, they have found that rising ocean temperatures are
a major factor. The warm water warms the air above it, causing it
to rise and increase circulation, and this seems to increase the
strength of westerly winds which push the warm water eastward.
   These changes can affect weather around the globe, although
researchers are still not sure exactly how all the various weather
events are connected.
   The 1982-83 El Nino was blamed for worsening the drought that
claimed many lives in Africa.
   In addition, that event brought a series of severe winter storms
ashore in California, disrupted the fish catch in South America,
spawned the first typhoon to hit French Polynesia in 75 years _
followed by five more in five months _ deluged Peru and Ecuador
with record rainfall and promoted the worst drought in 200 years in
Australia.

<HEAD>Soviet Newspaper Says Fired Moscow Party Chief Insists He Was
Right</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOGNE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Moscow Communist Party chief
Boris N. Yeltsin, fired for criticizing the slow progress of
reforms in the Soviet Union, says he was correct in speaking out, a
Soviet-published newspaper said.
   In an interview in the May issue of the German-language Moskow
News, Yeltsin was quoted as saying: ``I belong to the ones who are
willing to take the rough road and have no fear of risks.''
   Yeltsin was fired in November after a critical speech in October
before the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party.
   The report describes visits by a Moscow correspondent to
Yeltsin's office, where he now works as the Soviet Union's Deputy
Chief of the State Constructions Committee, and to a hospital where
he was admitted temporarily for heart problems.
   Moscow News is based in Cologne and lists as its publisher the
Soviet Union's Novosti news agency. It also lists the giant Gruner
and Jahr publishing house of Hamburg as one of the West German
companies cooperating in the publication.
   The May issue is the newspaper's first.
   Yeltsin was quoted as saying he was surprised to hear that there
were printed copies of his October speech.
   ``That must be a forgery,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying.
``There was absolutely no (printed) text of my speech at the
October plenum.''
   But the interview, published with a photograph of Yeltsin
walking with his grandson, Boris Jr. in what appears to be a park,
indicates he does not feel he was wrong in criticizing the Soviet
system.
   ``I spoke straightforwardly and said what I felt and thought was
correct,'' the report quotes him as saying.
   Yeltsin is quoted as explaining his reason for criticizing the
slow-moving reforms without citing any names.
   ``Someone had correctly said: Each must think independently, so
that later not all suddenly see the light all at once.''
   The report says Yeltsin declined to repeat what he had said at
the Central Committee meeting in October because the committee had
not formally decided to make the plenum remarks public.
   ``I as a Central Committee member am not permitted to violate
this rule,'' the newspaper quoted Yeltsin as saying.
   Lev N. Zaikov replaced Yeltsin as party chief of Moscow on Nov.
11 in what some political observers said was a move by Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to appease opponents of his reform
program for more openess in Soviet society.

<HEAD>Supermarkets to be Allowed to Offer Rainchecks, Substitutes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government is moving to legalize a
common supermarket practice, giving out rainchecks or substitutes
when a store runs out of advertised items.
   While an effective date has not been announced, the Federal
Trade Commission voted 3-2 Wednesday to permit substitutes and
rainchecks at grocery stores.
   Many stores of all types have been making such offers for years,
of course. But technically, the practice was made illegal for
grocery stores in 1971.
   In that year, the commission adopted a regulation requiring that
grocers have enough stock on hand to meet ``reasonably anticipated
demand'' for advertised items. Those that run out can be fined,
though that has rarely happened in practice.
   Under the change approved Wednesday, grocers that don't want to
offer substitutes or rainchecks would be allowed to advertise items
in limited supply if they clearly state in the ads that supplies
are limited.
   The 1971 rule was adopted following studies that showed as much
as 10 percent of advertised items were unavailable in markets in
the 1970s.
   By 1984, however, that rate had dropped to between 3 percent and
5 percent, and the commission began to reconsider the rule.
   The commission staff at that time reported that the costs to
supermarkets of observing the rule _ keeping added stock on hand
and perhaps limiting advertising _ raised the cost of groceries
more than the sale prices lowered them.
   In other words, the staff said, the rule was forcing consumers
to pay an extra 1.4 cents to 3.3 cents a week in their grocery bill.
   On that basis, some commission staffers recommended abandoning
the rule altogether, an approach that drew heavy negative public
comment in 1984.
   Nonetheless, Commissioner Terry Calvani pressed again Wednesday
to have the entire rule repealed.
   ``I don't believe there is a problem,'' he said, contending that
supermarket managers strive to please their customers rather than
injure them.
   In such a competitive business, if a market regularly failed to
stock advertised items, customers would just stop shopping there,
he said.
   Commissioner Andrew J. Strenio, though, contended that the rule
``simply requires retail food markets to honor the promises they
make in advertising.''
   Strenio added that he is skeptical of the statistics that show
the cost of the rule to be more than the savings to consumers, and
said he opposed any changes in the rule that has been in effect
since 1971.
   Thus, Calvani and Strenio voted against the amendment to permit
substitutions and rainchecks, but for opposite reasons.
   Voting for the new rule were Commissioners Mary Azcuenaga and
Patricia L. Bailey and Chairman Daniel Oliver.
   Oliver said he would prefer to join Calvani in eliminating the
rule altogether, but since that option had been defeated on an
earlier ballot, he would support the amendment permitting use of
rain checks or substitutes in order to give grocers as much
flexibility as possible.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz sought a new
arms control agreement and prepared for the next superpower summit
in talks today with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   U.S. officials acknowledged that verification and space-based
defense development dampened prospects the treaty would be ready to
sign at the May 29-June 2 summit in Moscow between President Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Shevardnadze, meeting Shultz at a Foreign Ministry mansion, said
as he frequently does before talks with the secretary of state:
``We are by nature optimists.''
   Upon arrival from Helsinki, Finland, Shultz was greeted by
Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov at Sheremetyevo airport,
then traveled directly to the mansion. Shultz did not speak to
reporters upon arrival.
   In a briefing Wednesday, Georgy Kornienko, a top official of the
Communist Party Central Committee, blamed the United States for the
slow movement toward a treaty to reduce long-range weapons by 30 to
50 percent.
   Senior American officials, briefing reporters Wednesday in
Helsinki while Shultz prepared for the talks, said the Soviets had
taken a hard line on space defenses and that progress on monitoring
three elusive weapons was also slow.
   The officials said the Soviets want cuts in strategic weapons,
which have a range of more than 3,400 miles, contingent on
adherence to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The Soviets contend
the 1972 treaty prohibits the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative,
the so-called ``Star Wars'' project to build a space-based nuclear
defense.
   The United States has rejected that demand.
   The other key problem is finding ways to monitor stockpiles of
mobile missiles and cruise missiles carried on warships and fighter
planes. Tracking sea-launched cruise missiles is probably the
toughest point.
   In addition to arms control, Shultz's agenda included talks on
the Iran-Iraq war, which threatens shipping in the Persian Gulf.
Shultz wants the Soviets to back the United States in the United
Nations Security Council to impose an arms embargo on Iran.
   With Soviet support, the council in July last year demanded a
cease-fire in the 7{-year-old war. But Moscow has since stymied
U.S. efforts to impose sanctions to pressure Iran.
   A U.S. official, who briefed reporters under rules of anonymity,
said Shevardnadze discussed the issue on Tuesday with Jack Matlock,
the U.S. ambassador in Moscow, and called Shevardnadze's attitude
``barely negative.''
   On arms control, Shultz told a Helsinki news conference it would
be hard to accomplish in time for a summit signing by Reagan and
Gorbachev.
   U.S. and Soviet drafts of the accord have 1,200 distinct points
of disagreement and the summit meeting is only five weeks away.
About half of the points are technical, but the others touch on the
difficult problem of verifying weapons reductions.
   On Dec. 8, Reagan and Gorbachev signed a treaty scrapping their
intermediate-range nuclear missiles, which have ranges between 300
and 3,400 miles.

   Soldiers patrolled Heathrow Airport today in
armored cars and tanks in a high-profile, anti-terrorist measure
one day after the hijackers of a Kuwaiti jetliner freed 31 hostages
in Algeria.
   The airport's operators said the patrols, carried out regularly,
were intended to familiarize soldiers with security at Heathrow and
were not a response to a specific terrorist alert.
   The soldiers, wearing battle dress and carrying weapons, set up
checkpoints with police along the airport's perimeter road and at
entrances to the terminal buildings, the British Airports Authority
said.
   The British army has held exercises at Heathrow, the world's
busiest airport in terms of international traffic, since the twin
terrorist attacks at Rome and Vienna airports on Dec. 27, 1985, in
which 20 people were killed.
   Police armed with submachine guns also began patrolling Heathrow
within days of the assaults by Palestinian terrorists. It was
believed to be the first time police in mainland Britain had been
seen displaying automatic weapons. Such official shows of force had
previously been known only in strife-torn Northern Ireland.
   Kuwait said nine Shiite Moslem hijackers were promised safe
passage to Iran or Lebanon after freeing 31 remaining passengers
aboard a Kuwait Airways 747 on Wednesday in Algiers. Two Kuwaiti
hostages were killed during the 16-day hijacking.

<HEAD>Speakes Says Book Not `Kiss-and-Tell'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former presidential spokesman Larry Speakes
said today he made up quotes from President Reagan out of loyalty
to the president, and the adverse reaction to it has been a ``total
surprise.''
   Speakes said he disagrees with Reagan that his book ``Speaking
Out'', which covers his six years at the White House and reveals
the quote-manufacturing, constitutes ``kiss and tell.''
   Speakes, appearing on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, also said he does
not fault the president for forgetting he told him about the phony
quotes while Reagan was in Geneva with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev. Speakes said in the book that a comment he provided as
having been made by Reagan to Gorbachev was never said, and another
quote he gave as Reagan's actually was said by Secretary of State
George Shultz.
   ``I did it on the spur of the moment. I did it in order to serve
the president. I did it as an act of loyalty to the president,
certainly not as an act of disloyalty to the president,'' Speakes
said.
   The furor over Speakes' confession led to his resignation last
week as chief spokesman for Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York _ a job
he took after leaving the White House.
   Reacting to Reagan's criticism of books written by a string of
former administration officials, Speakes said he doesn't think any
of the books, including his, falls into the category of ``kiss and
tell.''
   Such a book would ``have a little more juicy-type items in it
that are a little bit more punchy,'' said Speakes.
   As a former journalist, Speakes was asked if he did not know
that making up quotes would be controversial.
   ``No, it was a total surprise,'' he said. ``A lot of people have
told me that's done all the time in Washington, that you supply a
few quotes.''
   Speakes, who told a Washington Post forum on Tuesday that he had
been ``overzealous'' and ``misguided'' in concocting the quotes,
said today he did not know whether the sin was in the doing or in
the telling about it.
   ``It's hard for me to decide what I'm being critized for,'' he
said.
   Speakes defended his book as an honest account that he hoped
would ``contribute something to the long-term value of insights
into the Reagan administration.'' He said Reagan's presidency was a
watershed because he has ``changed the way we think about
government.''
   Speakes said he was pleased with indications that the book is
selling well and said he planned to continue giving public speeches
and promoting the book. ``I'll just let the dust settle a little
bit and look at opportunities in the future,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Stiff requirements tacked onto a
probation sentence for a man whose lion mauled a young girl should
warn the public that wild animals must be kept away from humans, a
judge says.
   State District Judge Ted Poe on Wednesday ordered Gary
Durkovitz, 35, of Houston, to serve a 30-day jail sentence, to get
rid of all his exotic animals and to stay away from children.
   The judge also ordered Durkovitz to do 20 hours community
service work each month with the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals and said he would have to approve any of
Durkovitz's future jobs.
   That was in additition to the 10 years probation and $5,000 fine
set by a jury Wednesday. Last week, the same jury found Durkovitz
guilty of injury to a child.
   A lion owned by Durkovitz attacked 8-year-old Roxanne Hernandez
at the Texas Flea Market in Houston last Oct. 10, biting off part
of her skull and exposing the child's brain.
   She has undergone reconstructive surgery and will have to have
more operations. The girl's mother, Sonia Hernandez, testified that
the girl has to wear a wig or cap in public and has trouble
concentrating.
   Since the attack, Durkovitz has been jailed on two charges of
indecency with a child and one of aggravated sexual assault of a
child. The cases, which are pending, stem from his allegedly using
the lion and other exotic animals to attract boys, prosecutors said.
   Defense attorney Robert Scardino said he was not surprised by
the probation restrictions, but said he would appeal the guilty
verdict.
   ``I don't think it was a crime. I didn't at the time. I don't
now and I never will, and I never will let this case go,'' Scardino
said. ``I think we've got a good chance to reverse it and try it
again.
   ``He could get 10 years in the penitentiary if he is retried,
but we are willing to take that risk,'' Scardino said.
   Harris County Assistant District Attorney Alice Brown had asked
the jury for the maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a
$5,000 fine, but said she was not disappointed in the punishment.
   ``It's just incredible to me that only one child got hurt and I
hope that if it turns any lesson it's that you're not supposed to
have these types of wild animals in the city,'' she said.
   Durkovitz, who testified that he had taken every safety measure
to prevent an attack, still faces a civil lawsuit in the case.

   For Rep. Norman Mineta, who spent part of his
childhood in a World War II internment camp, the Senate vote for
reparations to Japanese-Americans was ``unprecedented in the annals
of the history of any nation.''
   For Sen. Spark Matsunaga, who spent those same war years
fighting with the Army in Europe, it was ``long-denied justice''
that removed the ``one great blot'' on the Constitution.
   The two Japanese-Americans were on the Senate floor late
Wednesday as it voted 69-27 to approve a $1.3 billion bill that
would direct the U.S. government to give $20,000 tax-free payments
to Japanese-Americans who were rounded up and placed in camps after
the Japanese attack Dec. 7, 1941, on Pearl Harbor.
   They also would get an apology.
   The Senate voted down, 67-30 and 61-35, amendments that would
have deleted the payments and left only the apology. An amendment
by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to withhold payments until Japan
compensates American families for losses suffered at Pearl Harbor
also was rejected, 91-4.
   Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, estimated that about half the 120,000
internees survive today, although ``they're dying daily, weekly of
old age.''
   The elderly would get the money first under the bill's five-year
payout plan. But whether they get the money at all will depend on
further legislative action and a possible presidential veto.
   ``It's a very proud day,'' said Mineta, who was a 10-year-old
boy from San Jose, Calif., when war arrived. ``I just wanted to be
on the Senate floor when it happened.''
   ``The Senate without a doubt gave this country a great day,''
said Mineta, D-Calif. ``I'm only sorry that there weren't more
Niseis (Japanese-Americans) living today to be able to see a great
nation apologize for its actions. It is, I think, unprecedented in
the annals of the history of any nation.''
   Matsunaga, the bill's chief sponsor, was given the presiding
officer's chair so he could personally announce the vote he had
fought for years to win.
   At the end of the long, emotion-filled debate, he recalled his
combat duty with an all-Nisei regiment and the fellow
Japanese-American soldier whose death he witnessed.
   ``I had him cradled in my arms,'' Matsunaga said. ``He said,
`Lieutenant, I know I'm going to die, but I don't mind because I
know my people back home will be treated as U.S. citizens.'''
   Of the 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry who were held in the
camps, 77,000 were U.S. citizens, the rest legal and illegal
aliens. Many, like Mineta, had been born in the United States.
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, Hawaii's other Japanese-American senator,
said ``these payments acknowledge the unconstitutional deprivation
of liberty ... and the stigma of being deemed unloyal.''
   Inouye, like Matsunaga, fought in Europe, where combat cost him
his right arm and earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, the
nation's second highest military honor.
   The debate triggered other memories in senators who remembered
the war.
   Some said an apology was in order, but cash payments were not.
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., argued that the internment ``was
not a dishonorable act, it was the option of a nation in the first
days of a war.''
   Even if it was dishonorable, Wallop argued, it would be
``repugnant to think a clear conscience is to be had for a mere
$20,000 figure ... honor doesn't come with a dollar sign on it and
you don't buy it back.''
   Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev., said: ``I cannot in good conscience go
back and tell survivors of Bataan, Iwo Jima and all those battles
in the South Pacific and tell them we have forgotten you but we are
compensating the people who we moved into camps.''
   Money to pay the surviving internees will be contained in
appropriations bills spread over the next five years, with $500
million to be considered as part of the 1989 budget now before
Congress.
   While largely similar to the version passed by the House on a
243-141 vote last September, the Senate version also provides a
multimillion-dollar package for Aleut Indians moved from the
Aleutian Islands off Alaska during a Japanese attack in 1942.
   Matsunaga, asked about veto prospects, said, ``We have mixed
reports'' from the White House. The administration has voiced
support for the measure, said presidential spokesman B.J. Cooper.
But it has also sought changes in the legislation, including the
deletion of money for payments to the Aleuts.
   Citing its $1.3 billion cost, the White House Office of
Management and Budget has recommended that Reagan veto the measure.
   But Matsunaga said that Howard Baker, the former senator from
Tennessee and now Reagan's chief of staff, had told him that if
were still a member of the Senate he would have co-sponsored the
legislation.
   Mineta conceded that a veto ``would be very difficult to
override.''
   About 900 Aleuts were moved from their homes and forced to live
in abandoned mines, canneries and camps about 2,000 miles away.
Lack of medical care and adequate food contributed to disease and
death and many of their homes were destroyed or vandalized in their
absense.
   About 450 Aleuts survive and would be eligible for $12,000
payments. An additional $20 million would benefit Aleut villages
and provide for scholarships and the general welfare of the tribe.

   Some San Diego police officers are
questioning a former colleague's claim that he was shot and beaten
up at his home by three men who intended to kill him.
   Doyle F. Wheeler, a former San Diego police lieutenant who once
testified against a fellow officer in a murder trial, denied
Wednesday that he staged the attack. He said he was assaulted
because he testified last year that another San Diego police
officer was a racist.
   ``I know it had something to do with that,'' Wheeler told the
Spokesman-Review newspaper of Spokane.
   ``It was absolutely physically impossible for me to do it to
myself. It is impossible to hogtie and shoot yourself,'' he said.
   However, some San Diego police oficers cast doubt on Wheeler's
version of of how his head was grazed by a bullet in an incident
Tuesday at his home northwest of Spokane.
   Wheeler was treated and released from a Spokane hospital, said
Stevens County Sheriff Richard Andres.
   Wheeler was described by Assistant San Diego Police Chief Bob
Burgreen as ``a fellow who is really disturbed.''
   ``He (Wheeler) reported that someone tried to kill him, but
there was only a graze wound and powder burn,'' Burgreen told the
San Diego Tribune. ``He was handcuffed, tied up and had to dial 911
with his tounge. I find all of this very interesting.''
   The incident ``makes no sense,'' said Harry O. Eastus II, a
police officer and director of the San Diego Police Officers
Association.
   ``Based on (Wheeler's) past performance, there is a strong
likelihood that he could have done that to himself or paid somebody
to do it,'' he said.
   Local authorities have refused to release details about the
shooting and have declined comment on a possible connection to
Wheeler's testimony on behalf of Sagon Penn, a black who was
acquitted of murder and attempted murder charges in the 1985
shooting of two San Diego police officers.
   Wheeler testified that the attack was provoked by the white
officers.
   Police Agent Thomas Riggs died during the shooting, and police
Agent Donovan Jacobs and a civilian observer, Sarah Pina-Ruiz, were
wounded.
   Wheeler, who was a member of the San Diego force for about 10
years, retired on stress disabilty in 1985.

   Pratt & Whitney, maker of the engine involved in
an accident that forced an emergency landing at Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport, has asked users of the same model engine to
check their fuel filters.
   Federal crash investigators have been looking into whether a
loose fuel filter on a Horizon Air de Havilland Dash 8 might be
linked to Friday's engine fire and emergency landing in which 19
passengers were injured.
   ``Pratt & Whitney has gone out with an all-operator's wire
telling them to check their fuel filters to make sure they're on
tight,'' said Bob Benzon, lead investigator for the National
Transportation Safety Board team.
   The manufacturer sent telegrams to the operators Wednesday.

   A Supreme Court ruling that the government may
continue viewing alcoholism as willful misconduct instead of a
disease is a ``decision without any heart'' but one that will not
affect the help alcoholics can get, a spokesman for the American
Medical Association said today.
   By a 4-3 vote, the court held Wednesday that the Veterans
Administration acted properly in refusing to extend educational
benefits to two veterans who applied more than 10 years after their
service.
   The two men said in their suit they had failed to apply earlier
for the benefits because they were disabled by their alcoholism.
   ``We think the decision is wrong. We think it's a decision
without any heart and a decision which really doesn't treat the
medical evidence in a very sophisticated way,'' said Kirk Johnson,
AMA general counsel, in an interview on ``CBS This Morning.''
   Johnson said the decision would apply only to the VA, which he
said has an archaic benefit rule. He said society recognizes that
alcoholism is a disease and is ``far ahead of the VA or the Supreme
Court.''
   The justices did not attempt to decide whether alcoholism is a
disease, noting that the medical community remains sharply divided
on that issue.
   But the court said the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 does
not force the VA to treat alcoholism as a disease. The VA said the
men were suffering from ``primary alcoholism'' which is a result of
``willful misconduct.''
   Thomas K. Turnage, director of the VA, said the ruling supports
a system of regulations in place for more than 20 years and will
not affect the way veterans suffering from alcoholism are treated
in VA hospitals and clinics.
   ``It's really not going to affect (treatment of alcoholism) at
all,'' Turnage said in a telephone interview. ``We have a very
comprehensive program as it deals with alcoholism in our 172
hospitals and 232 out patient clinics ... We have a very
compassionate, understanding and concerned alcoholic program for
veterans who have this malady.''
   The ruling confirms a VA rule that veterans suffering from
primary alcoholism will not be given special consideration for
benefits because of their addiction, said Turnage. Veterans
suffering from secondary alcoholism will continue to receive such
consideration.
   Turnage said the difference is that secondary alcoholism results
from an underlying condition, such as psychological problems, and
primary alcoholism has no such underlying cause.
   Experts in the insurance industry said medical insurance
payments for alcohol rehabilitation will not be affected by the
ruling. And in the medical community, treatment of alcoholics will
remain the same, experts said.
   Lee I. Dogoloff of the American Council for Drug Education, who
was a Carter administration adviser on drug policy, said alcoholism
``has all the features of any other disease'' _ with a beginning, a
progression and an end-stage condition.
   Though there are different types of alcoholics, Dogoloff said
most medical researchers now accept that about 10 percent of
Americans have the ``genetic vulnerability'' to become helplessly
addicted to alcohol.
   ``Do you have a choice to take that first drink?'' Dogoloff
said. ``Sure. But once that threshold is crossed, it becomes a
disease'' for many alcoholics.
   He said companies will continue to support rehabilitation
efforts because American industry has found that such programs are
good for business. By helping alcoholics stay sober, Dogoloff said,
companies have increased productivity, prevented accidents and
prevented alcohol-related health conditions, such as liver disease,
that can be expensive to treat.
   Rob Bier, a spokesman for the Health Insurance Association of
America, said the ruling is unlikely to affect health insurance
programs, many of which provide benefits for the treatment of
alcoholism.
   ``Health insurance is a contract and if it covers alcohol
rehabilitation, then that will not change no matter what the
Supreme Court says,'' Bier said.
   And a spokesman for Alcoholics Anonymous, who asked not to be
named, said AA ``will still work with people the way we always
have.''
   Dr. David Goldman, a scientist at the National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, said medical researchers have moved
beyond the fundamental question of whether alcoholism is a disease.
   ``There are diseases that involve choice that are still
diseases,'' he said. ``An example is coronary artery disease. If
one eats fatty foods, it contributes to the disease, but it is
still classified as a disease.''
   The American Medical Association defines alcoholism as ``an
illness.'' The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, a psychiatrists' catalogue of diseases, lists alcohol
abuse and dependence.
   But Norma Phillips, the national president of Mothers Against
Drunk Driving, said the decision should challenge the idea that
drunks are helpless victims of an uncontrollable disease, which she
said has encouraged some judges to give light sentences for drunken
driving.
   ``I feel this decision is fair and just and that this encourages
judges to give sentences to fit the crime of drunken driving,'' she
said. ``The fundamental issue is responsibility.''

<HEAD>Guard Says Demjanjuk Confessed To Serving At Death Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Demjanjuk, convicted of being a
brutal Nazi death camp guard despite his insistence that he was a
victim of mistaken identity, admitted his guilt two years ago, a
U.S. marshal says.
   Demjanjuk, a former Cleveland autoworker who was found guilty
Monday by an Israeli court of war crimes, said in the hearing of
Lee Koury and another marshal accompanying him from a federal
penitentiary in Springfield, Mo., to Israel in February 1986:
``They don't understand. It was war. I had to do it.''
   ``The statement was made almost like he was thinking out loud,''
Koury said Wednesday. ``He was sort of looking out the (airplane)
window. The statement was not made to the deputy or me.
   ``It was an admission of guilt. But I didn't think much of it at
the time. I knew that Demjanjuk had fought losing his citizenship
and being extradited. But I did not know that he had denied that he
was who they believed he was.''
   And Deputy Marshal Richard Schroeder said: ``It was clear to me
that when he realized he was really going to Israel, he was trying
to justify to himself what he had done. He was trying to
rationalize.''
   Demjanjuk was convicted of being the Treblinka death camp guard
known as `Ivan the Terrible'' for his brutality. Ivan helped
operate the gas chambers at the camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, where
850,000 Jews were killed in 1942 and 1943. According to testimony
at the 14-month trial, Ivan often exceeded the atrocities ordered
by his superiors, beating prisoners on their way to the gas
chambers with a metal bar or bayonet.
   He is to be sentenced Monday and could receive the death penalty.
   Two days after their arrival in Israel, Koury, the U.S. marshal
for the Western District of Missouri, said Israeli prosecutors
interviewed him and Schroeder for four hours about Demjanjuk's
statement. Both officers were listed as trial witnesses, though
they were never called to testify.
   He said they also were asked by the Justice Department and the
Israeli government not to mention the statement until after the
case was resolved.
   Koury and Schroeder said Demjanjuk struck them as a man who knew
his time was coming.
   ``I remember that when we landed in Israel, he turned and looked
me square in the eyes and said, `You've brought me here to be
hanged,''' Schroeder said.
   ``He seemed a little apprehensive as we were handing him over to
Israeli authorities,'' Koury said.
   But the only emotion he showed, the marshal added, ``was when he
made that statement: `They don't understand. It was war. I had to
do it.'''

   A black businessman was hospitalized after
he swallowed pieces of glass and part of a mouse at a restaurant he
had been warned to avoid, he and his mother say.
   Oliver ``Sterling'' Mason III, 20, owner of a gift shop in a
Holiday Inn, complained to Anne Arundel County police last week
that he had received racist letters and an anonymous warning
telling him not to eat in the hotel again.
   He lost consciousness after taking a bite of a crab dish Tuesday
at the Holiday Inn restaurant.
   Maura Vonasek, a spokeswoman at Anne Arundel General Hospital,
said Dr. Daniel McCabe found scratches in Mason's mouth and upper
esophagus. More X-rays will be analyzed today, she said. Mason was
released Wednesday.
   A police report confirmed that pieces of a mouse and glass were
found in food retrieved from the restaurant by Mason's mother,
Griselda Mason, 44, of Ellicott City.
   Mrs. Mason said her son had sent his crab dish back to the
kitchen to be reheated. When the food was returned, Mason took a
bite and they both heard a ``crunching sound,'' she said. He began
to choke, stood up, grabbed his throat and vomited, she said.
   An official of the hotel said in a statement Wednesday he
disputed Mason's story.
   ``Our investigation of the matter and interviews with our
employees gives us no reason whatsoever to believe that there is
any truth to Mr. Mason's charges of either discrimination or
contaminated food,'' Jaap van der Vorm, vice president of
Alexandria Management Co., which owns the hotel and restaurant.
   ``No one on the property ever saw the contaminated food. The
hotel staff did call the rescue squad when Mr. Mason appeared to
suffer a seizure in the restaurant. ... At this time we are not
ruling out the possibility of a hoax,'' van der Vorm said.
   Mason last week filed a complaint with police over six letters
filled with sexual and racist innuendo. He said he believed the
anonymous letters came from a hotel employee.
   County police decided the letters did not constitute a threat
under state law and referred the case to the FBI as a possible
civil rights violation.
   City Councilman Carl Snowden demanded the U.S. Justice
Department investigate whether Mason's civil rights were violated.
The Justice Department said it would.

   Georgia law prohibits the execution of murderers
who were under the age of 17, the state Supreme Court has ruled.
   The court's decision Wednesday prohibits the state from seeking
a death sentence against Clinton Bankston Jr., who was indicted in
Clarke County for two murders alleged to have been committed when
he was 15 years old and for three slayings when he was 16.
   Bankston is charged with murder in Athens in the April 1987
knife slayings of Glenn and Rachael Sutton, two retired University
of Georgia professors; and the August 1987 hatchet slayings of
Sally Nathanson, 59, her daughter, Helen Nathanson, 22, and Mrs.
Nathanson's sister, Ann Orr Morris, 63.
   His attorneys say Bankston will plead innocent by reason of
insanity.
   At issue in Wednesday's Supreme Court ruling was a statute
dealing generally with capital cases which includes this provision:
   ``When it is shown that a person convicted of a capital offense
without a recommendation for mercy had not reached his 17th
birthday at the time of the commission of the offense, the
punishment of such person shall not be death but shall be
imprisonment for life.''
   Bankston's attorneys had filed a pre-trial motion to prevent the
district attorney from seeking the death penalty, but it was
rejected by the trial judge.
   The court said that the context of the statute did raise a
question whether the Legislature intended only to block the the
death penalty for those under 17 who were charged with capital
crimes other than murder, such as rape, kidnapping and armed
robbery.
   However, it said a 1977 U.S. Supreme Court decision effectively
blocked the death penalty for all but murder cases.

<TEXT>
   Christian and Shiite Moslem militiamen
battled with rockets and machine guns in south Beirut today, and
police said two people were killed and five wounded.
   Police said Shiite gunmen from various factions and Justice
Minister Nabih Berri's Amal movement fought the right-wing
Christian Lebanese Forces militia for about an hour.
   A police spokesman said he did not know what sparked the clash,
the second in four days between the Shiites and the Lebanese Forces.
   But it flared after the Syrian-backed Amal said it had thwarted
a bizarre plot by the Lebanese Forces to assassinate Berri.
   The independent An-Nahar daily quoted an unidentified Amal
official as charging that the Christians had assigned a maid
working at Berri's home to assassinate him with an
``explosives-rigged jacket.''
   An Amal official contacted by The Associated Press said the
An-Nahar report was true.
   He refused to disclose the woman's whereabouts or say whether
she had voluntarily informed Amal of the alleged plot. The Lebanese
Forces declined comment.
   Berri is Syria's main ally in Lebanon. The Lebanese Forces, led
by Samir Geagea, is at odds with Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon.
   A strike called by the General Confederation of Labor Unions was
partially observed today, reflecting disunity among workers on how
to combat a severe economic crisis.
   Representatives of the 300,000-member confederation toured
Beirut's Moslem and Christian sectors and other cities trying to
muster support for the strike.
   The unions seek a 300 percent pay raise. They rejected the
government's offer of a 75 percent increase.
   The Lebanese economy, once the most flourishing in the Middle
East, has been torn by 13 years of civil war. Inflation is rampant,
unemployment growing and the Lebanese pound has collapsed.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said about 50 percent of Moslem and Christian areas
were closed.
   Some schools, restaurants, movie theaters, gasoline stations and
other businesses stayed open in Beirut. Union officials led
supporters in two demonstrations urging the government to respond
to their demands.
   ``We are hungry, we want to eat,'' the estimated 3,000
demonstrators chanted.

   Reparations to Japanese-Americans interned during World War II
would pay a debt of honor, although it would not heal all wounds,
said a man who unsuccessfully challenged the mass internment.
   ``Like someone who's a victim of a serious accident and becomes
a quadriplegic, no matter what's voted in the way of
acknowledgement of error, it'll never be whole,'' Gordon
Hirabayashi said Wednesday in a telephone interview from Edmonton,
Canada.
   Earlier Wednesday, the Senate approved a bill that calls for the
government to apologize for the mass roundups and make each of the
estimated 60,000 survivors eligible for a tax-free payment of
$20,000. The House has passed a similar bill.
   After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, about 120,000
Japanese-Americans were forced to give up their homes and
businesses and put in internment camps.
   In Seattle, Cherry Kinoshita rejoiced after the Senate vote.
Forty-six years ago, she was uprooted from her home and sent to a
camp in Idaho.
   ```Pleased' would be an understatement,'' she said. ``We've been
working for over 10 years to see this happen. I think it's great to
see our nation admit an error, and take steps to remedy what was a
great injustice.''
   ``I think the Japanese-Americans have reconciled to the fact
that certain things have taken place and there are some scars,''
said Hirabayashi. ``At this stage, what they really wanted was an
acknowledgement that a wrong was done and a vote for an honorable
redress.''
   Hirabayashi's World War II conviction of resisting curfew and
violating the military internment order was overturned by a federal
appeals court in September.
   The 9th Circuit, however, refused to rule on the
constitutionality of the internment, which the U.S. Supreme Court
had upheld during Hirabayashi's original appeals in the 1940s.
   Even though the government has not appealed the latest ruling,
Hirabayashi said his lawyers had asked the Supreme Court to take up
the case again so the high court's previous decision can be removed
from the records.
   ``The country doesn't have too many opportunities to redress
something,'' Hirabayashi said. ``When it does, I think we should
take that opportunity and look to the future to keep the honor of
our country inviolable.
   ``I think that result would be the finishing touch to what the
Japanese-Americans hope that their tragedy will contribute to.''
   The issue took a long time to be resolved because of the shame
the Japanese-Americans felt at being locked up and the federal
government's willingness to bury the matter, Hirabayashi said.
   ``In this case, the victims were so traumatized by this
experience that they had not recovered enough to talk about until a
decade or so ago,'' he said.
   ``There was nothing in the history books,'' he said. ``Now the
situation is different. We have to take some kind of historical
perspective on this. Forty years is not all that long.''
   Sam Shoji, 62, of Seattle, a social worker for the Veterans
Administration who was incarcerated for 13 months, said the money
was ``only a token ... but at least it is there.''
   ``It was basically a concentration camp,'' said Shoji.
   Ms. Kinoshita, who was 18 when she went with her family to the
camp at Minidoka, Idaho, was one of many Japanese-Americans who
worked to convince the government that internment defied the
Constitution and was a racist act.
   ``We hope this will acknowledge that this was a tragic travesty
of justice, and that with this legislation we can hope that it will
never, ever recur again to another group,'' she said.
   Rodney Kawakami, a Seattle attorney who has been active in
seeking redress, said the money also was important because ``there
are still significant numbers of Americans who believe the
internment was justified because of what the government of Japan
did at Pearl Harbor.''
   He said the $20,000 was less than what individuals lost in being
forced to move, but was significant enough to carry a message.
   Rudy Tokiwa, a wounded veteran of the 422nd Regimental Combat
Team, formed by Japanese-Americans in World War II, said the bill's
passage accomplished part of what he and his buddies fought for.
   ``But I wonder whether we will succeed in the rest? We went for
freedom, the freedom to be treated the same, as Americans and there
would be no such thing anymore as `He's an Asian,' or `He's a
German,' or `He's white,' or `He's black,''' Tokiwa said in San
Francisco.

   Iran and Iraq observed a cease-fire today
in their seven-week ``war of the cities'' after Iraq fired missiles
into the holy city of Qom and said it would stop firing if Iran
also did.
   Iran's navy commander said his warships fought a ``heroic
battle'' against U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf on Monday and
charged the Americans fired on his men in the water after they
abandoned their vessels.
   The unofficial cease-fire, which Iraq said would begin at
midnight (4 p.m. EDT Wednesday), appeared to be holding despite an
all-out mobilization declared by Iran to confront the United States
and Iraq.
   During their 7{-year war, Iran and Iraq have observed several
temporary cease-fires when one side offered to stop firing if it
had the last shot. The bombardments usually resume after a short
period.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said Iraqi
troops fired two long-range missiles into Qom at 11:45 p.m. and
said they would be the last if Iran did not retaliate.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in
Cyprus, said several civilians were killed and others wounded when
the missiles exploded in residential areas of the holy city, 100
miles south of Tehran and the seat of Iran's religious hierachy.
   The Iraqis earlier fired missiles into Tehran, the central city
of Isfahan and the southern city of Shiraz. IRNA reported civilians
were killed, but gave no numbers.
   Since the latest flareup in the war of the cities began Feb. 29,
hundreds of civilians have been killed in missile, air and
artillery attacks. Iran and Iraq have pounded each other's cities
intermittently since 1984.
   IRNA said Iranian forces killed or wounded 300 Iraqis and
captured more than 250 in the Shemiran mountain region of Kurdistan
in northern Iraq on Wednesday.
   Iraq said its forces were mopping up Iranian pockets of
resistance in the southern Faw peninsula, which it recaptured from
Iran over the weekend.
   At United Nations headquarters in New York, Iran on Wednesday
told the U.N. Security Council that Iraq used ``cyanide, nerve and
mustard gases'' on a large scale during the battle in the Faw
peninsula.
   The U.S. frigate USS Jack Williams went on alert Wednesday after
an Iranian C-130 transport plane ignored a warning as it approached
the vessel in the gulf.
   ``We are an Iranian warplane, doing our duty,'' the pilot
responded.
   ``Martyr, do your duty,'' added an unidentified voice.
   Minutes after the plane landed at Iran's nearby Abu Musa Island,
the frigate went to ``general quarters,'' the Navy's highest alert,
and crewmen investigated whether the plane had dropped a canister
of CS riot control gas on the ship. Nothing was found.
   The Iranians' clashes Monday with the U.S. Navy and the
unexpected Iraqi recapture of Faw, the first major Iraqi offensive
in two years, have clearly jolted the Iranians.
   Tehran Radio said all volunteers, known as ``basij,'' should
report to bases throughout the country ``and get ready for
departure'' to the battlefront.
   The U.S. Navy destroyed two Iranian oil platforms, sank an
Iranian patrol boat, crippled two frigates and damaged three other
attack boats on Monday. It was the worst U.S.-Iran clash since the
Navy buildup last July to curb Iranian attacks on shipping.
   The Iranians said they lost 44 men in Monday's clashes. There
were no reported U.S. casualties, but the two-man crew of a Marine
helicopter was missing.
   IRNA quoted Iranian Rear Adm. Mohammed-Hussein Malekzadegan as
saying the Americans fired on crewmen from the frigate Joshan who
had jumped into the water and killed several.
   The agency also quoted an unidentifed naval officer as saying
the Americans shot missiles at Iranian crewmen in lifeboats and
killed several, including a marine who had rescued six of his
comrades.
   A U.S. Navy officer aboard the Williams, which was involved in
Monday's fighting, said the captain of the Sabalan, the other
Iranian frigate damaged in the battle, was ``a real fanatic.''
   ``He's the one who shoots holes in the tankers in the Strait of
Hormuz, then says, ``Have a nice day,''' said the officer, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Jim Martin has ordered that
Confederate flag bumper plates no longer be sold through privately
run businesses that also sell North Carolina license plates and
validation stickers.
   The rebel flag plates had been sold at many of the 125 offices.
   Martin decided to limit sales of the plates after being
questioned about them last week by a group of black business
leaders in Winston-Salem, Division of Motor Vehicles Commissioner
William Hiatt said Wednesday.
   Asked whether the plates being sold at the license plate
agencies were in good taste, Martin said, ``Probably not.''
   The motor vehicles commissioner can cancel a contract with a
private license-plate agency with 60 days' notice and without
reason, Hiatt said.
   State license plates go on the backs of vehicles, and motorists
often attach other plates on the front bumper.

   U.S. military teams are scouting Pacific and
Southeast Asian nations for alternative sites in event new military
lease agreements can't be reached with the Philippines' government,
says America's top Pacific military commander.
   There is a ``serious-minded, success-oriented approach to the
alternatives,'' Adm. Ronald J. Hays said.
   Hays said in an interview Monday that he has been surprised at
the intensity of issues being debated in the review of the 1947
Military Bases Agreement under which the United States maintains
facilities at Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller
installations in the Philippines. The agreement expires in
September 1991.
   ``However, I'm still optimistic about reaching an agreement. The
economic security and political implications associated with our
departure would be astronomical,'' Hays said.
   He declined to identify nations which might host U.S. military
bases.
   ``The problem is that the nations who are forthcoming to us on a
private basis and who will readily concede that indeed bases at
Clark and Subic are important are unwilling for a variety of
reasons to go public and to take an official public position of
support for the United States,'' said Hays.
   The admiral said it would cost $10 billion or more to duplicate
the facilities in the Philippines. However, he said that less than
half that amount might be available to prepare alternate bases,
which would mean a reduced U.S. presence in the region.

   A repair kit is being offered for the Schaper
``Speed Wheels'' ride-on toy to prevent children's fingers from
becoming trapped between the pedal bar and the toy's body, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission announced today.
   About 25,000 of the toys were sold without finger guards in
1986, and the repair kit supplies those guards. Eight incidents of
cuts or severed fingertips have been reported, the commission said.
   Involved is the Schaper Speed Wheels toy, model number 61106.
   The repair kits are available by writing Speed Wheels Corrective
Action Program, Tyco Toys Inc., 540 Glen Avenue., Moorestown, N.J.,
08057, or by calling 1-800-257-7728.
   Speed Wheels was designed and sold by Schaper Manufacturing Co.
of Minneapolis, but Tyco has since purchased that firm.
   Individuals needing more information can contact the safety
commission at 1-800-638-2772.

   Police say they have no suspects in the first
killing of an officer this year, but authorities also opened an
investigation into why the ambulance carrying him bypassed the
hospital nearest the shooting.
   Henry Ford Hospital officials said they were prepared to treat
Officer Paul Dunbar Jr. after being alerted by Emergency Medical
Service dispatchers but he never arrived.
   Dunbar, 31, died in surgery at 4 a.m. Wednesday at Detroit
Receiving Hospital.
   Mayor Coleman Young said the city would investigate
communications between Ford Hospital, EMS dispatchers and the
ambulance that picked up Dunbar at the shooting scene.
   Dunbar was found shortly after 3 a.m. with a gunshot wound to
his chest in front of a home on the city's north side, Officer
Allene Ray said.
   Police had no suspects, said Officer Fred Zaharoff.
   Neighbors quoted anonymously in the Detroit Free Press today
said Dunbar was shot outside a house where ``crack'' cocaine has
been sold in recent weeks. Unidentified police sources were quoted
in the newspaper as saying Dunbar was the subject of an internal
drug investigation. Zaharoff refused to confirm that.
   Zaharoff also said police were not directly involved in the
ambulance investigation. Ford Hospital is about one mile from where
Dunbar was found; Receiving Hospital is three miles away.
   Brian Cheatham, a Ford Hospital spokesman, declined to speculate
whether the additional time needed to take Dunbar to Receiving
Hospital might have given surgeons time to save the officer's life.
   Calls to EMS officials were referred to Robert Berg, a spokesman
for Young, who did not return telephone calls.

   President P.W. Botha today
proposed including blacks in the electoral college that chooses the
president and possibly in the Cabinet.
   In a major speech to Parliament, Botha stopped far short of
proposing full black voting rights or abolition of apartheid
legislation.
   But he said his National Party would stick to its widely
criticized program of slow-paced reforms despite claims from the
increasingly powerful far right that most of the 5 million whites
oppose even modest concessions to the black majority.
   Botha's proposal to include blacks on the electoral college
would, if implemented, mark the first time that blacks had a direct
voice in the selection of South Africa's president. He gave no
details about how much strength blacks might be given on the
college.
   Botha also suggested that the Cabinet might be opened to people
not serving in Parliament. This would clear the way for
participation by blacks, who are excluded from Parliament.
   Botha's initiatives appeared unlikely to ease international
pressure on South Africa for an end to apartheid, which establishes
racially segregated residential areas, health services and schools
and deprives the 26 million blacks of a vote in national affairs.
   But domestically, Botha's message seemed to be that his
government would not be intimidated by the success of the
extreme-right Conservative Party in three recent parliamentary
by-elections.
   ``I appeal to everyone to remain calm, to restore balance and to
recognize each other's rights,'' he said. ``If we wish to live
together peacefully in this beautiful land, the time has come to
reflect on what unites us instead of emphasizing that which divides
us.''
   Botha reiterated his government's longstanding proposal for
creating a national advisory council on which he and his top
Cabinet ministers would negotiate with black leaders on drafting a
new constitution that would bring blacks into the central
government.
   ``We are not committed to the name, the form, the composition or
the functions of such a body,'' he said. ``We are committed to the
concept of a forum for deliberation.''
   Most prominent black leaders have rejected Botha's overtures to
participate in the national council. They say the government first
must free imprisoned black nationalist leaders like Nelson Mandela
and lift restrictions on major anti-apartheid organizations.
   Botha became South Africa's prime minister in 1978. That
postition was abolished in 1984 with the adoption of a new
constitution, and he was installed as president.
   In his speech, Botha proposed that the office of prime minister
be revived to handle day-to-day governmment affairs so the
president could be freed to concentrate on major policy matters and
ceremonial duties.
   Botha said political progress in South Africa would be impeded
by continued foreign pressure from the ``international brotherhood
of persecutors.''
   He also chided anti-apartheid clergymen, such as Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, for their increasingly vocal opposition to
the government and their continuing calls for punitive sanctions.
   ``They take the lead in isolating the republic in economic and
other fields, without caring in the least about the detrimental
results,'' Botha said. ``They accordingly play into the hands of
the ANC.
   The outlawed African National Congress is the major guerrilla
movement fighting the government.
   The president said only a small fraction of South Africa's
Christians supported the anti-apartheid stance of Tutu and other
clergymen affiliated with the South African Council of Churches.

   The trustee of PTL, who lost a battle in a
federal appeals court over the ministry's right to tax-exempt
status, says he may pursue further appeals.
   A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Richmond, Va., on Wednesday affirmed a decision by U.S. District
Judge Karen L. Henderson of Columbia.
   She found that the bankruptcy court where PTL is under
reorganization proceedings did not have the authority to issue a
preliminary injunction preventing the IRS from lifting the
tax-exempt status.
   David Clark, trustee for the ministry founded by Jim and Tammy
Bakker, said the ruling may be appealed.
   ``Our hope is that we have demonstrated good faith to the IRS by
the way the place has been run and the (changes) that have been
made to operations and integrity that they might be willing to hold
off,'' he said.
   Clark made the comment after a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
during which Judge Rufus Reynolds approved the sale of $3.2 million
in PTL property.
   Lawyers for the Fort Mill-based ministry had argued that the
loss of the status could scuttle reorganization efforts.
   Attorneys for the IRS said failure to revoke the status could
cost the government from $55 million to $82 million in back taxes.
The agency is seeking to make the revocation retroactive to May 31,
1981.
   A spokesman for the IRS in Washington, Steven Pyrek, declined to
comment on the agency's next move.
   In Columbia Wednesday, Reynolds approved the sale of $3.2
million worth of property _ eight houses and some land in the Lake
Wylie area.
   One of the houses belonged to Richard Dortch, once Bakker's top
aide, and sold for $425,000 at an auction.
   The net gain to the ministry from the sale will be nearly $2
million, according to C. Edwin Allman III, an attorney for Clark.
   An attorney representing a group of PTL donors said he will
file, within 30 days, a class action protesting the sale of any of
the ministry's property.
   Robert Zanesky of Westport, Conn., said the donors'
contributions are worth more than all of PTL's property. ``Our
claim will take up everything that PTL owns,'' he said.
   Reynolds told the people gathered in the courtroom that he has
been getting telephone calls and letters supporting the return of
the Bakkers.
   ``If you've got any star preference you want to get back in, I'm
not the one. The trustee is the one to decide,'' Reynolds said.
``It is not the court who employs preachers.''
   Bakker, who stepped down from PTL in March 1987 amid a sex and
money scandal, said he wrote Reynolds last week requesting a chance
to help the ministry back to financial stability.
   ``What would it hurt if Jim and Tammy were given 90 days to see
what we could do?'' Bakker said Tuesday in an interview with The
Herald of Rock Hill. ``If at the end of 90 days I had not helped,
I'd be glad to walk off into the sunset.''
   Bakker said he was seeking reinstatement as a minister with the
Assemblies of God and is trying to arrange a meeting with members
of the North Carolina Assembly in order to ``mend fences.''
   Bakker also says he still hopes to buil a $2 billion religious
resort in the desert near Coachella, Calif.
   He said Wednesday that he has not been able to buy a 1,700-acre
site he favors, but insisted progress is being made toward
developing his proposed Heritage Springs International resort,
either there or elsewhere.
   Coachella Mayor Frank Duran said a Texas developer is interested
in a country club project on the same land.
   The planned resort would include a 1,000-room hotel, three golf
courses, recreational vehicle park, a 20,000-seat auditorium and a
1,200-seat theater for religious plays. It also would include a
5,000-seat television studio.
   ``We need to get back on television to move things along,''
Bakker said. ``It's the old question of the chicken or the egg and
which comes first.''

<HEAD>Administration Prods Israel to Move to Peace Negotiations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration, in a statement
issued on Israel's 40th anniversary, prodded Israel and other
nations in the Mideast ``to move ahead and get to productive peace
negotiations.''
   President Reagan ``remains convinced that our peace initiative
is balanced and offers the only realistic basis on which to make
progress,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a
statement.
   The statement was issued after Reagan signed a U.S.-Iraeli
memorandum that formalizes the two nation's consultative groups and
their strategic cooperation. The groups meet periodically to
discuss joint military and security assistance, as well as economic
development issues.
   The Oval Office meeting, reportedly attended by Vice President
George Bush and Isaeli ambassador Moshe Arad, was closed to
reporters.
   The memo, Fitzwater said in a statement, ``reflects the enduring
U.S. commitment to Israel's security. That commitment will never
flag.''
   ``The president knows that a strong Israel is necessary if peace
is to be possible. He also knows that Israel can never be truly
secure without peace.''
   The statement noted that Secretary of State George Shultz has
been asked to pursue the U.S. peace initiative in the region and to
seek ``a comprehensive settlement which will assure Isareli
security and provide for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian
people.''
   Shultz has shuttled among the Israelis and Arabs in recent weeks
with little success in promoting the U.S. peace plan.
   ``The president reiterates his appeal to the leaders in the
region not to miss this opportunity to move ahead and get to
productive peace negotiations. This has been an objective that
Israel has fervently sought over the last 40 years,'' Fitzwater's
statement said.

   A tribal judge said his dismissal of an
attorney left him with no choice but to delay a hearing in a
custody dispute between the Navajos and a California couple over a
9-month-old Navajo girl.
   Judge Manuel Watchman of Navajo Tribal Children's Court on
Wednesday recessed Allyssa Keetso's temporary custody hearing for
48 hours after he disqualified a court-appointed lawyer from
representing the child.
   ``Certainly a child has the right to be represented adequately
at these proceedings, and that was the bottom line of this whole
thing,'' Watchman said after the hearing.
   A tribal lawyer said it was likely another attorney would be
named by Friday.
   Attorney Robert Walters was dismissed after he entered a motion
to dismiss the temporary custody proceeding.
   Violet A.P. Lui, an attorney representing the tribe, declined
comment.
   Karen Diakun, a tribal spokeswoman, said Watchman placed the
baby temporarily in the custody of Rick and Cheryl Pitts of San
Jose, Calif., the non-Indian couple who have cared for her since
birth and who want to adopt her.
   Watchman also ordered them to stay on the reservation, Ms.
Diakun said.
   Patricia Keetso, 21, Allyssa's mother, was pregnant and single
when she contacted the Pittses through a newspaper ad. She lived
with them before and after Allyssa was born and has said she wants
the couple to adopt her daughter.
   Susie Keetso, the baby's grandmother, said, meanwhile, that
tribal representatives had pressured her to sign papers seeking to
bring Allyssa to the reservation for the custody hearing.
   Ms. Diakun said one reason the tribe entered the custody issue
``was a strong desire expressed by the grandparents that they
wanted the child returned to the reservation.''
   But Mrs. Keetso said she always has wanted the Pittses to adopt
Alyssa. ``The way they talked at me, it seemed like they were just
going to put me in jail or something like that,'' she said.
   The tribe intervened in the adoption proceedings under the
Indian Child Welfare Act, which gives tribes jurisdiction under
certain circumstances to determine custody in adoption proceedings.

the Christian church in the United States has been ``cleansed and
judged'' as a result of scandals involving television evangelists.
   ``Many of the clergymen are being certain that they have
integrity in a way they didn't a couple of years ago,'' said he
69-year-old Southern Baptist minister, who is on a 16-day tour of
China.
   Television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart was defrocked by the
Assemblies of God Church this month after he confessed to
unspecified sins against the church and his family. A prostitute
has said Swaggart paid her to pose nude for him.
   Jim Bakker, former head of the PTL television empire, resigned
last year in a sex scandal involving church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   ``I think the church has been, in a sense, helped by all this
because it's been cleansed and judged,'' Graham said in answer to
an American student's question at the Nanking University-Johns
Hopkins Center for Chinese and American Studies.
   He spoke during a question-and-answer session after addressing
150 American and Chinese students and faculty at the center, which
the two schools opened in October 1986.
   Graham said the scandals will not destroy the Christian church
in the United States.
   ``The church will always be there,'' he said. ``(It) is news
when you have religion and sex and money all mixed up, but that's
not the story of the regular churchgoer.''
   Graham, who arrived in Nanking on Wednesday evening, spoke for
nearly an hour on the role of religion in American society.
   Afterwards, Graham visited the Amity Printing Press, the only
printing plant in China that prints mainly the Bible and other
religious material.
   The plant, on the outskirts of Nanking, opened in December and
is expected to print at least 600,000 Bibles this year. Ninety
percent of the facility's printing time is devoted to the Bible,
which is sold at most Christian churches for about $1.90.
   Graham has preached in more than 60 countries, including the
Soviet Union. This is his first visit to China.
   His wife, Ruth, was born and spent the first 17 years of her
life in east China's Jiangsu province, where her father was a
missionary surgeon.
   On Wednesday, the couple visited Mrs. Graham's birthplace in
Huaiyin on the banks of the Grand Canal, the longest man-made
waterway in the world.
   In Beijing, the evangelist met with Premier Li Peng and preached
in a Chinese church.
   Graham is to speak to students at the Nanking Theological
Seminary, China's largest theological training center, on Friday
before going to Shanghai, where he is to preach again.
   He plans to visit Canton before leaving China on April 28.

   Two small planes collided over northern
Italy today and one crashed into a house. Two people in the other
plane were killed when it crashed into a field.
   Firefighters said the two people aboard a Cessna 150 that
crashed on the outskirts of Vergiate were killed instantly. The
town is near Lake Maggiore about 30 miles northwest of Milan.
   Two people aboard a Siae Marchetti 260 TP that crashed into the
roof of a two-story house were injured and rushed to a hospital.
   The house was badly damaged, but no one was home at the time of
the crash, firemen said.
   Police said the planes collided while preparing to land at a
small air field.
   Authorities identified the dead as Alberto Cattalan, 40, the
instructor who piloted the Cessna, and his apprentice, Giacomo
Nisoli, 25, both Italians.
   Those injured, whose condition was said not to be serious, were
identified as Italian pilot Silvano Galli, and former Dutch air
force pilot Rudolf Herman Friderich, from Leiden. Both are 57 years
old.

   Jesse Jackson, boosted by a
Philadelphia newspaper's endorsement, plunged into a series of
north Pennsylvania campaign stops today, five days before the
state's Democratic primary.
   First stop was Williamsport, where he donned a sweatshirt and
gave enthusiastic students his familiar lecture on avoiding illegal
drugs and teen-age sex leading to pregnancy.
   His speech was delayed for a few minutes as students crowded to
the front of the Williamsport Area High School gymnasium to get
photos of Jackson in a sweatshirt with ``Williamsport'' on the
front.
   The night before, Jackson staged a rally at a plaza across from
Philadelphia's City Hall, where a crowd of 3,500 cheered and called
``We want Jesse.''
   The Democratic presidential contender appeared undaunted by his
defeat in New York Tuesday at Michael Dukakis' hands.
   ``We have come a long way, and we will not turn back,'' he said.
``We must go forward. We are almost there. You keep on holding on.
I want to lead our nation beyond racism, beyond sexism, beyond
anti-Semitism.
   ``I give you a choice ... I am the alternative in the Democratic
Party,'' he said.
   Jackson was taken aback when told the Philadelphia Daily News,
an afternoon paper with a circulation of about 252,000, was giving
him its endorsements in today's editions.
   ``I don't believe it!'' he said.
   In its editorial, the Daily News said, ``Nominating Jesse
Jackson sends a message to the world, which is not made up of
elderly white businessmen, no matter what Reagan thinks.
   ``Social change doesn't happen instantly,'' the editorial said.
``It took 32 years after the nomination of Al Smith to elect a
Roman Catholic president. If it's going to take 32 years after the
first black nominee, it's past time to get started, especially
since the black man is the only candidate who seems to understand
the soul of his own party.''
   The same newspaper on Wednesday, joined by the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, published a poll that showed Jackson running 40
percentage points behind Dukakis in Pennsylvania. There are 178
Democratic delegates at stake in the primary.
   Jackson declined to comment on the poll, saying, ``I do not
follow opinion polls, I mold opinion. And that's why I am a leader.
I will take my case to the people.''
   Jackson arrived in Philadelphia Wednesday afternoon, and was
greeted by Mayor W. Wilson Goode, the first black mayor in the
nation's fifth largest city.
   Four years ago, the mayor supported Jackson's opponent, Walter
Mondale, but he made an early endorsement of Jackson this year.
   Jackson went to the Philadelphia Nursing Home to visit AIDS
victims. In the lobby he greeted employees and residents, stopping
briefly at the elevator to shake the hand of Gregory Graland,
paralyzed by a bullet in his spine, who was lying on his stomach on
a stretcher.
   ``He said to me, `Hi brother, keep up hope,''' Graland said. ``I
said thank you. I meant to wish him good luck but he went by so
fast.''
   After a half-hour session with a dozen AIDS patients, Jackson
brought victim Drew Aller, 29, into the lobby.
   ``We need to shift the focus from hysteria to health care,''
Jackson said, urging that more resources be devoted to helping
victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``I'm here because I care,'' he said.

   Donald Trump, who scored a public relations coup
over City Hall by rebuilding the Central Park skating rink, today
offered the same deal for repairing the closed Williamsburg Bridge.
   The real estate mogul took a tour of the decaying, 85-year-old
span, then said he would be willing to put up an estimated $250
million, which the government would repay, for repairs. Trump
rebuilt the Wollman Skating Rink under a similar arrangement.
   ``An easy solution is to spend a lot of money but if you can
spend a little money and get the same results for it, or a better
result, that's what I'd be here for,'' Trump said.
   The bridge was closed last week when city transportation
officials found cracks in its beams. An inspection is under way to
determine the extent of the damage, and officials have said the
bridge will be closed at least three weeks.
   Alfred A. DelliBovi, head of the federal Urban Mass
Transportation Administration, had invited Trump to examine the
bridge, and joined him for today's tour.
   In a letter to Trump, Dellibovi lauded him as a builder whose
projects come in ``on time, under budget and built to last.''
   In 1987, Trump showed up the city bureaucracy when he took over
repair of the skating rink and finished the job in five months and
under budget. The city had spent 7{ years and $12 million on what
was supposed to take 2{ years and $4.5 million.

   Joseph J. Cicippio, who has been held
hostage in Lebanon for 19 months, has never looked so thin as in a
photograph released this week, relatives said.
   ``This picture sort of shows that he is getting very weak, from
what I can see,'' said Thomas Cicippio, one of five brothers living
in Norristown.
   Cicippio said Wednesday the photograph was ``very distressing''
to the family, particularly because a French hostage released in
November reported that Cicippio was in good health.
   ``He's got a distant look, and I've never seen him so thin. He
really looks down and out to me,'' he said.
   A group calling itself the Revolutionary Justice Organization
included the photograph with a threatening statement delivered to a
Beirut newspaper, warning of retaliation for U.S. military action
in the Persian Gulf this week.
   The photograph showed Cicippio, 57, wearing a navy blue track
suit. He was looking directly into the camera, but he wasn't
wearing his eyeglasses.
   Thomas Cicippio said a U.S. State Department official called
Tuesday to tell him about the photograph released by the group
claiming to hold Cicippio and Edward Austin Tracy, a Vermont writer
abducted in West Beirut in October 1986.
   ``They just informed us there was a new photo released of Joe
and that there were more threats on his life. We haven't heard any
more since then,'' said Cicippio, 64, a retired postal worker who
has acted as spokesman for his family since the abduction Sept. 12,
1986, of his brother, acting comptroller of the American University
of Beirut.

   Thirty-one hostages freed after 15 days
aboard a hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet flew to waiting families in
Kuwait today. Officials in Beirut denied reports that the hijackers
found haven in Beirut.
   The 24 passengers and seven crew members from the Kuwait Airways
Boeing 747 that was seized April 5 left Algiers airport at 3:20
p.m. (12:20 p.m. EDT). They were freed Wednesday.
   KUNA, Kuwait's official news agency, said an official and public
reception was planned for tonight. Most of the former hostages are
Kuwaiti.
   The hijackers had demanded that Kuwait free 17 imprisoned
terrorists, which Kuwait rejected. But there were reports that
Kuwait agreed to commute the death sentences of three of the
prisoners.
   Before the hostages left aboard a Kuwait Airways Boeing 767,
Kuwaiti official Ahmad Fahd said all were found fit to travel after
medical examinations at the military hospital in Algiers. Fahd was
sent here to oversee the crisis.
   The nine hijackers, who had killed two Kuwaiti hostages, were
believed to have left Algeria after slipping out of the plane ahead
of the hostages at dawn Wednesday.
   KUNA, citing unidentified Algerian sources, said Algerian
mediators promised the hijackers safe passage to travel to Beirut
or Tehran.
   Western diplomats in Algiers, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they believed the hijackers went to Beirut.
   CBS, without naming sources, said today that the hijackers had
arrived in Beirut. But Beirut airport officials, also speaking
privately, told The Associated Press that the hijackers had not
arrived.
   The plane was seized April 5 on a Bangkok-to-Kuwait flight with
112 aboard and diverted to Mashhad, Iran, where the terrorists
released 57 hostages.
   Freed passengers said they believed more gunmen boarded at
Mashhad with submachine guns and dynamite, which was later wired to
the plane's doors.
   After three days in Mashhad, the plan flew to Larnaca, Cyprus.
During five days there, the hijackers beat two Kuwaiti security
men, shot them to death and dumped their bodies from the aircraft.
The hijackers let 13 more hostages go in exchange for fuel that
brought them to Algiers.
   Several days before giving up, the hijackers freed an ailing
passenger.
   Throughout the ordeal, the hijackers demanded that the Persian
Gulf sheikdom free 17 pro-Iranian extremists imprisoned for the
1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassies there.
   Kuwait steadfastly refused, and its rulers were lauded by their
people on Wednesday for standing firm. But there was some anger
expressed in Kuwait because the hijackers had been allowed to go
free.
   The deal also provoked criticism from the United States, Britain
and the International Air Transport Association, a Montreal-based
trade association that represents 170 international airlines.
   ``They are not only hijackers but murderers,'' Secretary of
State George P. Shultz said in Finland on Wednesday while en route
to Moscow for pre-summit talks.
   Western intelligence officials have said they believe two of the
hijackers were Lebanese nationals under U.S. indictment for the
1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner in which a U.S. Navy diver was
slain.
   Rodney Wallis, security director of the International Air
Transport Association, told The Associated Press: ``We can assume
we have not heard the last'' of the hijackers. ``We now have the
possibility that a number of trained hijackers could lead missions
of their own.''
   Neither Algeria nor Kuwait would disclose terms of the deal.
However, NBC News reported that unidentified U.S. officials
believed the Algerians provided the hijackers with letters or tapes
from the 17 prisoners in Kuwait so friends and relatives could see
the prisoners had not been harmed.
   A U.S. official in Washington said efforts were made to assure
the hijackers the 17 were not mistreated. But the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, did not confirm the the
hijackers were given letters or tapes.
   KUNA said the hijackers left the plane in two shifts 10 minutes
apart on Wednesday. The hostages staggered down the gangway 20
minutes later. Among them were three cousins of the Kuwaiti ruler,
Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah.
   An Algerian air force transport plane force took off shortly
thereafter. It is rare for military aircraft to use the civilian
Houari Boumedienne airport, and there was speculation hijackers
were aboard.
   Algerian officials would not discuss the flight or its occupants.
   Interior Minister Hedi Khediri, who led the Algerian mediators,
announced the drama's end without giving details and said the fate
of the hijackers was the ``concern of Algeria'' alone.
   KUNA said the crisis ended ``without any deal'' concerning the
17 imprisoned pro-Iranian extremists, but there were reports Kuwait
agreed to commute the death sentences that had been given to three
of the 17 prisoners.
   A Kuwaiti official in Algiers, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he believed an understanding may have been reached
that would commute the sentences to life in prison.

   An Amnesty International report on human
rights accuses Colombia's armed forces of political repression and
murder, but government officials criticized the study as one-sided.
   ``There have been only a few occasional faults or excesses, and
these have been punished as an example for others,'' Colombia's
defense minister, Gen. Rafael Samudio Molina, told reporters
Wednesday.
   In a report released Wednesday, the London-based international
human rights organization accused Colombia's armed forces of
engaging in a ``policy of terror and political murder.''
   The report said the armed forces plunged the country into a
``human rights emergency'' by extending political repression to
encompass not only leftists but anyone who failed to support the
government forces.
   Alvaro Tirado, President Virgilio Barco's adviser on human
rights, said, ``if the Amnesty International report shows the armed
forces and the government as the only sources of violence in
Colombia, then it is one-sided.''
   Former Foreign Minister Alfredo Vasquez Carrizosa, president of
the Colombian Committee for Human Rights, said he did not share the
opinion of Amnesty when it charged the ``existence of a deliberate
policy of political murder'' in the armed forces. He said he had
``no evidence for these charges.''
   ``There are paramilitary groups,'' he said. ``These have been
denounced since 1983 by the attorney general. ... My question is:
Why has there been no investigation of those paramilitary groups?''
   Amnesty said that in July and August political repression in
Colombia entered ``a new phase, and the country is in the grip of a
human rights emergency.'' In those two months anonymously authored
`hit lists' of prominent Colombians were published and a wave of
killings of students, university lecturers and human rights leaders
in Medellin was reported.
   Amnesty said ``hundreds of case studies show that killings and
`disappearances' blamed on the `death squads' were in fact carried
out by police and military personnel.''

   Newly released police files reveal
that the young woman who reported a ``girl in a polka dot dress''
running from the scene of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination
admitted two weeks later that she had lied.
   ``You know, I thought I was supposed to see more _ more than I
did,'' the woman, Sandra Serrano, says in microfilmed documents in
the Los Angeles Police Department that could lay to rest 20 years
of controversy over the report.
   Meanwhile, a former prosecutor said he is certain no photographs
or investigative matter important to the investigation of the June
5, 1968, assassination were purposely destroyed by police.
   ``There just wasn't any reason for anyone to just deliberately
destroy something that had any significance,'' the former
prosecutor, now Judge Lynn D. Compton of the 2nd District Court of
Appeal, said Wednesday by telephone from a home he has in Lopez,
Wash.
   The files, opened at the state archives on Tuesday, contain a
certificate that shows 2,410 police photographs were burned on Aug.
21, 1968. Chief archivist John Burns speculated the photos may have
duplicated others still in evidence. But he said the files contain
no such statement.
   A large portion of the documents deals with Miss Serrano, a
college student who reported that she had confronted the woman on
the night of Kennedy's shooting at the Ambassador Hotel in Los
Angeles.
   The files showed that Miss Serrano first told her story to
officers at 4 a.m. June 5 at police headquarters in Los Angeles.
She was one of hundreds of witnesses interviewed.
   Miss Serrano, who said she was chairman of the Youth for Kennedy
chapter in Pasadena, said she came to the hotel that night to hear
Kennedy speak but left the Embassy ballroom because it was too
crowded.
   She recalled being seated on a step outside when ``I thought it
was a backfire of a car. ... I thought I heard six shots, six
backfires.
   ``About half a minute later this girl comes tearing down the
stairs saying _she said, `We shot him. We shot him.' And I said,
`Who did you shoot?' And she said, `Senator Kennedy.'''
   She said she had seen the same girl earlier in the evening and
she was clad in a white voile dress with dark polka dots.
   She stood by her story for a time and even went with police to
the Ambassador Hotel for a reenactment of her actions, the file
showed. But on June 20, 1968, when she was reinterviewed by police
after failing a lie detector test, she declared, ``The whole thing
was a lie.''
   She suggested that she and other witnesses who told police about
the polka dot dress had created the story while waiting to be
interviewed by police. She blamed the pressures and excitement of
the event for her actions.
   And she indicated she almost began to believe her own
fabrication.
   ``I don't know why I said it. ... It just fitted. ... I really
thought there was something behind it. I was conned,'' she said.
   The following day, June 21, police canceled an all-points
bulletin for a woman in a white polka dot dress.
   However, the story did not die, and triggered years of
controversy over whether Sirhan Sirhan, the man convicted of
killing Kennedy, had acted alone.

   Now that Rose Mofford has been governor
for more than two weeks, a Senate committee has decided it's time
to change the constitutional provision that bars her from holding
the job.
   The proposed amendment passed 7-0 by the Senate Government
Committee on Wednesday would drop the word ``male'' from the list
of qualifications to be governor, attorney general, treasurer,
secretary of state and school superintendent.
   The amendment has already been approved by the House. If passed
by the Senate, it would go on this fall's election ballot.
   As she voted for the bill, Sen. Carol Macdonald said that when
she read the Arizona Constitution recently, ``I came to this clause
and I about had a stroke.''
   Mrs. Macdonald said she realized the U.S. Constitution took
precedence over the provision but added, nonetheless, ``I think it
ought to be changed.''
   Committee Chairman John Mawhinney drew groans from other panel
members when he joked, ``I wonder whether we could discuss the
appropriateness of whether we ought to allow females to hold these
offices.''
   Sen. Alan Stephens wondered how much it would cost to hold the
public referendum, but added that the proposal was ``something
that's long overdue.''
   Mrs. Mofford became governor April 4 when Evan Mecham was
removed from office on his impeachment conviction by the state
Senate. She had been secretary of state since 1978.

<HEAD>Meat Industry Putting Out Leaner Beef</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cattle producers are already turning out much
leaner beef than many people think, and those steaks, roasts and
burgers probably will lose still more flab if consumer demand
continues, says a new study by Texas A&M.
   Moreover, although researchers say it's hard to tell for sure,
those juicy fast-food hamburgers probably are leaner than they
sometimes look.
   Overall, the Texas A&M study found the amount of visible or
separable fat was down 27 percent in retail cuts from two years
ago, and the fat content of ground beef was down 10 percent.
   The study, which was released Wednesday by the Agriculture
Department, involved supermarket surveys in late 1987 and early
1988 in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Los
Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, Seattle, Tampa, Fla., and
Washington, D.C.
   Randomly selected retail beef cuts contained an average of 78.9
percent separable lean, 11.7 percent separable fat (3.3 percent
external fat and 8.4 percent ``seam'' or intermuscular fat), and
9.4 percent separable bone and connective tissue.
   The weighted average of fat content of all retail beef cuts in
the 1988 survey was 9.99 percent, compared with 13.76 percent fat
in 1986.
   H. Russell Cross of Texas A&M told a news conference that while
Americans like beef, their perception is that it's a fatty product.
   Earlier studies showed ``marked improvement'' in consumer
perception when the outside fat on retail cuts was trimmed to
one-quarter inch of fat or less, compared with the previous
standard of one-half inch. Most retailers began using the
quarter-inch fat trim after 1985.
   ``The reduction in separable fat meant that long-standing
assumptions on amounts of fat Americans were getting from beef
perhaps were not correct'' and that more up-to-date information was
needed, Cross said.
   As a result, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service put up
$20,000; the Cattlemen's Beef Promotion and Research Board,
$20,000; and the Beef Industry Council, $5,000 for the new study.
The project was administered by a foundation of the National
Cattlemen's Association.
   Jeff Savell, a Texas A&M colleague, said the study found that
more than 40 percent of the retail cuts had no external fat.
   The average fat thickness on steaks and roasts from primal cuts,
or the major wholesale cuts, was 0.14 inch, while the average for
all cuts, from chuck roast to stew meat was 0.11 inch, or less than
one-eight of an inch, he said.
   ``We found that the amount of beef fat in American supermarket
meat cases on a given day is now 1.2 million pounds less than in
former years,'' Savell said. ``That's 4{ billion fewer calories.''
   A committee of the National Research Council recently reported
that Americans are eating too much fat and urged the industry and
government to help correct the situation by breeding leaner animals
and changing federal grading regulations.
   Cross said the latest survey showed that in the case of beef the
less-fat recommendation of the scientific panel is being carried
out.
   ``The next step in the war on fat is to trim more of the fat at
the packer level, where it can be done more efficiently,'' he said.
``Eventually, we must depend less on butchers' knives to get rid of
the fat and more on production of leaner cattle.''
   Further changes are needed in the marketing system so that
cattle producers are rewarded financially for turning out cattle
with less trimmable fat, he said.
   Cross said the impact of leaner beef on fast-food hamburgers is
difficult to determine.
   ``First, we need to realize that the fast-food ground beef is
probably not as fat as you might expect,'' he said. ``The average
fat content is probably somewhere between 18 and 20 percent for the
fast-food hamburger, whereas the average for this study was right
around 19 percent.''
   That doesn't mean your favorite juicy burger at the local
drive-in is leaner than the meat bought at supermarkets.
   ``There's essentially three kinds of hamburger that are normally
offered at retail _ regular, which is around 23 or 24 percent fat;
lean, which is around 18 or 19; and extra-lean, in this study,
which was around 14 to 15,'' Cross said. ``So, fast-food ground
beef is right in the middle of the pack.''

   Hungary's first pet cemetery will open
this fall after the necessary permits are issued to the private
group that will run it, a government newspaper reported Thursday.
   The last resting place for the ``loved ones'' is being
established by the Rakosvoelgye cooperative farm, ``true to the
spirit of the age _ engaging in entrepreneurial activity,'' the
daily Magyar Hirlap said.
   The animal cemetery will be located just outside the capital.
   ``Of course, burying the pets will cost some money,'' Magyar
Hirlap said, but the report did not say how expensive it would be.

   A man who said he spied for the Soviet
Union in West Germany was freed and expelled due to insufficient
evidence he spied in Switzerland, the Federal Prosecutor's Office
said Thursday.
   The 41-year-old engineer, a Spanish national, admitted passing
documents from a technical institute to the KGB for years while
living in West Germany, according to the prosecutor's office.
   But an investigation into his Swiss activities was dropped due
to lack of evidence, the statement said.
   The man was barred from re-entering Switzerland, the office
said. A Zurich resident since 1985, he worked in the research
department of a Swiss electronics company.
   The office did not release his name or reveal his whereabouts.
   Deportation to West Germany was ruled out by international
agreements forbidding extradition for political crimes, it said.
   Zurich police detained the man March 23 on a tip resulting from
a sweep by West German authorities that netted 10 suspected Soviet
agents the week before.

<HEAD>Former Governor Bills State for Recall Campaign Expenses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham has sent the state
a $230,717 bill for his recall campaign expenses, including office
rent, a down payment on a fund-raising letter and legal fees.
   The bill lists expenses incurred by the former governor from
Feb. 1, the date then-Secretary of State Rose Mofford called the
recall election, to April 4, when Mecham was convicted by the
Senate of impeachment charges and removed from office. Mrs. Mofford
became governor.
   Under the state constitution, public officials facing a recall
election are allowed to bill the state for reasonable campaign
costs.
   But the constitution does not outline what action should be
taken if the recall election is canceled, Attorney General Bob
Corbin said.
   The May 17 election was canceled by the state Supreme Court on
April 12.
   State Treasurer Ray Rottas said he has no authority to pay the
bill without an appropriation from the Legislature.
   Bills have been introduced to pay Mecham anywhere from $75,000
to $150,000 for campaign expenses, but legislators have not
seriously discussed either proposal.
   Mecham's bill, sent this week to Rottas, includes as
``reasonable election campaign expenses'':
   _ $28,543 in payroll costs, including $8,280 to Edith
Richardson, who was put on unpaid leave from her job as a Mecham
special assistant on Nov. 9 to coordinate recall activities.
   _ $3,600 in rent payments for his Glendale office, located in a
building he owns and has occupied since shortly after the House
voted Feb. 5 to impeach him. Mrs. Mofford, who was named acting
governor because of the House vote, had offered Mecham space in
state buildings, but he rejected it because he said it was not
sufficient.
   _ $65,000 to Jameson Campaigne, an Illinois political
consultant, for the deposit on the March fund-raising letter that
went to 100,000 conservatives nationwide.
   _ $3,018 in legal fees to Robert L'Ecuyer, an attorney who did
research work on Mecham's impeachment trial and also was a witness
on a charge Mecham misused public money by loaning $80,000 to the
his Glendale auto dealership.
   _ $25,250 to David Hill Research Consultants for a survey.
   _ $56,328 to American Comnet for a ``campaign media contract.''
   Rottas said he sent a letter Wednesday to Senate President Carl
Kunasek and House Speaker Joe Lane saying the bills are ``all
there, and now what are we going to do about it?''
   Kunasek said he believes the issue ``should be clarified one way
or another.''
   ``My question is what happens if we don't _ do we all get thrown
in the slammer?'' Kunasek asked.
   Lane has said that he is not against paying reasonable expenses
incurred by Mecham.

   A gasoline company's advertising
campaign using images and doctored quotes from Martin Luther King

angry public reaction.
   Full-page newspaper ads by the Jet company display a familiar

``someone's gotta clean up the discount jungle.''
   King's vision of a racism-free world characterized by his famous

   The Aftonbladet newspaper reported scores of readers called in

<DATELINE>HAVANA, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York said
today his mission in Cuba was accomplished after a midnight meeting
with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, whom he described as responsive.
   The two discussed the relationship between church and state in
this atheist nation.
   The meeting in the presidential palace lasted until about 2:30
a.m., O'Connor said. Castro received O'Connor at about 11 p.m.
after the cardinal celebrated an evening mass in Havana's Roman
Catholic cathedral.
   ``We discussed the general relationship between the church and
government here. We discussed the possibility of building bridges
for peace,'' O'Connor told reporters as he toured medical clinics
in Havana.
   He said Casto was especially laudatory of Catholic nuns in Cuba
and said the Cuban leader expressed delight at the idea of getting
visas for more to come to the country.
   ``I feel that the mission was accomplished, that the president
recognized clearly my primary purpose for coming here, and that was
to show my solidarity with the bishps of Cuba and to show that the
church in the United States and the church in Cuba and throughout
the world is one church,'' he said.
   Earlier today, thousands of worshipers filled the cathedral for
the Mass.
   About 2,000 people poured into the 284-year-old cathedral in
Havana's colonial district for O'Connor's first Mass in the
capital. Church bells rang and the applause was deafening as a
procession of 75 white-cloaked clergymen walked slowly toward the
altar, singing the hymn ``Pueblo del Rey,'' or ``Land of the King.''
   As the cardinal neared the altar, a man grabbed his hand and
kissed it.
   The procession included all seven of Cuba's Roman Catholic
bishops and Monsignor Raul del Valle of the New York archidocese, a
Cuban native who returned to his homeland on Tuesday for the first
time in 27 years.
   ``There has been a mistake,'' O'Connor said jokingly in Spanish,
addressing the huge crowd. ``You've welcomed me as a pope, but I am
only a cardinal, a poor cardinal.''
   Reporters barely got a chance to hear the cardinal speak before
they were hussled to a bus and taken to the presidential palace.
Gerald Costello, editor in chief of Catholic New York, a weekly
Catholic newspaper, briefed reporters at the palace on the
cardinal's remarks.
   O'Connor departed from his prepared text several times, once to
introduce del Valle, who he said was suffering from cancer.
   ``We have great hope that there could be a miracle and we hope
so because he is an inspiration, he's a saint and an inspiraton,''
the cardinal said.
   O'Connor also called it a ``miracle'' that del Valle had been
allowed back in Cuba after leaving in 1961 for the United States.
He thanked the Cuban government for allowing Del Valle to visit his
homeland.
   Repeating the theme of his four-day Cuban trip, O'Connor said
the church must be allowed to serve as a ``bridge'' between people,
regardless of political ideology.
   ``I hope that peace will come to the peoples of the United
States and the peoples of Cuba,'' O'Connor said. ``But peace is not
possible without justice for everyone.''
   O'Connor is the first American cardinal to visit Cuba since
Castro came to power in 1959 and this was his first Mass since
arriving in Havana on Tuesday.
   He is in Cuba as a guest of the Roman Catholic Church to help
celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of the Rev. Felix
Varela. The priest, who served in New York City from 1823 to 1853,
is considered a Cuban hero in the struggle against Spanish colonial
rule.
   The cardinal is scheduled to leave Cuba on Friday morning for
New York.

   A small earthquake shook northern San
Diego County early today, causing no damage but the rumbling
awakened some residents, authorities said.
   The quake registered 3.3 on the Richter scale and was centered
in the Palomar area 30 miles north of downtown San Diego, said John
Minsch, a geophysicist with the U.S Geological Survey's Earthquake
Information Center in Golden, Colo.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude, or the height of quake-generated shock waves recorded
on a seismograph.
   Some 40 people called radio station KMLO in nearby Fallbrook to
report they felt the 1:15 a.m. temblor, said station employee Neil
Mars.
   ``It woke a lot of people up,'' he said, adding that the calls
came from as far north as Oceanside and eastward to Rancho
California near the San Diego-Riverside county line.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two-hour battle neared its climax. Tension
was palpable. Rhythmic chants from fans urged on the competitors,
who wiped sweat from their brows as the interlocutor spoke like the
voice of the Chronicler.
   When it was over, the annual International Bible Quiz had its
first American victor in 15 years. Jeremy Weider had won the World
Series, the Super Bowl, the World Cup of Old Testament scholarship
for Jewish teen-agers.
   ``I'm elated,'' said the 17-year-old from Monsey, N.Y. ``I
studied so hard for this. Two hours of Bible reading every day for
seven months. But I never thought I'd win.''
   Weider, a religious Jew who attends Yeshiva University in New
York, shared first place with Zehava Heder, an Israeli with an
identical point total.
   Contestants were given more than 20 questions involving
intricate details of quotations from the Jewish Bible, which is the
Old Testament of the Christian Bible. The last question was posed
by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who asked them to identify 10
quotations about visions of peace.
   The co-winners were among hundreds of Jewish teen-agers from
around the world who came to Jerusalem for the contest, which is
held every year on Independence Day and broadcast by Israel
television.
   ``This is a really big deal,'' said Noga Harom, 19, of New York
City borough of Queens, who finished second last year. ``It's a
huge honor. I mean, these are the very best Bible students in the
world.
   ``Usually only the Israelis win because they're so well-trained.
Now the underdogs have taken it. It's a World Series upset.''
   ``Thank heavens the pressure's off,'' said Noah Feldman, 17,
from Cambridge, Mass., who placed fifth this year. ``It was so much
work.''
   An audience of nearly 1,000 attended the contest in a Jerusalem
theater.
   As the field was reduced to seven finalists, fans grew more
boisterous in support of their favorites.
   One group chanted the name of one contestant, ``Oren! Oren!'' as
though at an athletic event.
   ``Sshh!'' an elderly man admonished. ``You're at a Bible quiz,
not a football game!''
   Competitors were the winners of regional contests from 19
countries, including Israel, the United States, Canada, South
Africa, Ireland, France, Spain, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Argentina.
   The competition is sponsored jointly by the Israeli Education,
Defense and Religion ministries and Jewish organizations.
   Weider and Heder, the co-winners, received elegant sets of
religious volumes.
   Many teen-agers in the audience said they were glad they gave up
holiday picnics and barbecues to attend.
   ``What a great way to celebrate Independence Day,'' said Paula
Posner, an 18-year-old student from Toronto. ``It really gives you
a sense of pride.''

election campaign is viewed abroad.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is what some newspapers and political commentators around
the world had to say Thursday about the outcome of the New York
Democratic primaries:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Guardian of London (liberal): ``It was the dirtiest, most
dangerous race so far: and some of the details of the result are
concomitantly disheartening. The blacks of New York voted for Jesse
Jackson. The Jews (after particularly unpleasant broadsides from
Mayor Koch) voted against him. There's a clear racial divide in the
final primary accounting, with too much potential for bitterness
left behind. Cheerfully, however, the winner and runner-up were in
action yesterday stressing harmony and unity. Dukakis and Jackson
have the opportunity to make something good out of something bad;
and they see the need.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ITALY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Vittorio Zucconi writing in La Repubblica of Rome
(left-leaning): ``The New York of racial grudges, ... of too much
money and too much misery, accomplished with brutality, perhaps
with honesty, that which the rest of America had not yet dared to
do: it told Jesse Jackson and the black population that their
challenge to the sky cannot be accomplished.
   ``The black Icarus of American politics saw his wings melt when
he got too close to the sun of victory. He will keep on flying, he
might even score some victories in the remaining 50 days of
primaries before California ... but the duel for the conquest of
the White House seems a private affair between George Bush and
Michael Dukakis.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Alberto Pasolini Zanelli in Il Giornale of Milan
(conservative): ``The anti-Jackson pact, upheld by nobody and
actually denied by everybody, is already operative: the
`establishment' within the Democratic party has closed ranks behind
Dukakis.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Ennio Caretto in La Stampa of Turin (moderate): `` ... in New
York, the melting pot of the superpower, America voted against
Jackson and against what they wrongly thought he represented. ...
America saw in the black leader both adventure _ the friendship
with Arafat and Castro _ and revolt: in other words the claim of
socio-economic equality.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SINGAPORE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Business Times: ``The acrimonious New York primary campaign is
over. And, finally, the Democrats have a reasonably clear
front-runner for the presidential nomination, Massachusetts
Governor Michael Dukakis. Still, from a long-distance perspective,
American politics appears to be suffering from a despairing lack of
leadership. At the beginning of the marathon campaign, Americans
had the luxury of choosing from a gaggle of candidates. Yet, the
voters seem to waffle, first to this one then to that one. The
problem appears not to have been too many possibilities but the
lack of a distinct choice. ...
   ``Now that the field has been presumably narrowed to just two
front-runners _ Dukakis and Vice President George Bush, whose
Republican nomination needs only the sound of a gavel _ perhaps the
candidates can stop defending their electability and start showing
their leadership qualities. The voters are waiting, and the rest of
the world is watching.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRAZIL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _O Estado de Sao Paulo (conservative): ``Dukakis' victory in New
York and his brilliant conquest of the lead in the arduous primary
races are due less to Jackson's flaws than to the qualities of the
governor of Massachusetts. The American voters see in this austere
man, so opposed to demagoguery that he becomes even boring by the
criteria of the mass media, the image of security and honorability
they want to see connected with the presidency, an institution
eroded by scandals in recent times.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SWITZERLAND</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Le Matin of Lausanne (independent): ``The dwarf has grown up.
This time, Michael Dukakis posted a decisive victory. The
Massachusetts governor has cleared all hurdles for the Democratic
Party nomination in July. ... He triumphed in the state of Mario
Cuomo, the non-declared favorite; despite the hostility of Mayor Ed
Koch, who supported Albert Gore; despite the popular charisma of
Jesse Jackson, who carried the black vote. The support of the
Jewish community, which holds so much power in the United States,
from now on is an important trump card in his campaign.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Neue Zuercher Zeitung of Zurich (conservative), on the
possibility of Jackson becoming Dukakis' running mate: ``If he did,
Dukakis could write off his ambitions right now. He has to get a
Western or Southern conservative onto his ticket unless he wants to
follow Mondale's hardly advisable example of four years ago. ...
For the same reason, it is unlikely that Jackson will play
kingmaker in Atlanta, or will receive and accept an offer for a
Cabinet post.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GREECE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Avriani of Athens (left wing), saying Dukakis has failed to
take a position on Greece's regional disputes with Turkey and the
Cyprus problem: ``Listen Michael, the Greek immigrants will vote
for you and help you economically ... but you had better take a
stand now. You have to say now that if you get elected you'll kick
the Turks out of Cyprus and secure our borders.''

   The names ``Owyhee View'' and ``Southern
Desert'' were nice, but they just didn't seem to project the right
image.
   Idaho Maximum Security Prison, however, was a perfect fit.
   ``It connotes exactly what kind of place it is,'' said L. James
Koutnik, a member of the Idaho Board of Correction. ``It's not a
flower garden or a country club. It's a maximum-security prison.''
   Tim McNeese, assistant corrections director, said the department
has received suggestions for a name including Owyhee View Prison to
Southern Desert Correctional Facility. The prison is being built in
the high desert from which the Owyhee Mountains are visible.
   Board members said some states name their prisons after people.
To which Corrections Director Al Murphy said, ``I don't want to
hear `Happy Al's Correctional Facility.''
   The vote Wednesday was unanimous for Idaho Maximum Security
Prison.

   Avoiding alcohol after the prom could be
beneficial _ and not just for the obvious reasons.
   Students who attend an after-prom party Saturday night will have
a chance to win a 1976 Mercury Montego worth at least $500.
   Organizers said the event is designed to offer students an
alternative to customary parties with alcohol.
   Students who wear formal attire to the party, arrive within 30
minutes of the end of the prom and stay until the end of the
festivities will be eligible to win the car. Special drawings also
are planned for a VCR and dinner for two.
   Co-chair Barbara Nelson said the car has 140,000 miles on it,
but a mechanic has checked it and it appears to be in good shape.
   ``A bunch of us mothers are going to wax it. We think it's going
to be OK,'' she said.

   A Rice University senior was placed on probation
and told to pay $1,500 for rotating a statue of the school's
founder.
   Patrick Dyson, 23, called the discipline reasonable but said he
has no regrets about the prank he carried out with 10 other
students.
   ``It was in the true spirit of college pranks and of a great
engineering school,'' he said, adding that he still expects to
graduate May 7.
   ``It was a fun thing to do, to make people smile and laugh. No
one has criticized us,'' he said, ``except for the president and
the proctor. And it's their job to criticize us for it.''
   E.C. Holt, the school's proctor and chairman of the civil
engineering department, said ``there was the potential for all
kinds of bad things to happen.''
   The 58-year-old statue of William Marsh Rice, which normally
faces east, rests atop a granite base containing an urn holding the
founder's remains. After the prank on April 12, it faced west.
   The fine represented the cost of turning the statue back to its
customary direction.

<HEAD>Man Who Put Building Inspector's Eye Out Gets Maximum Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FERNANDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who put out the eye of a
building inspector who told him his fence was too high received a
maximum seven-year sentence after writing to a judge that the
victim was lucky he wasn't shot.
   Samuel Duran, 41, of Los Angeles was sentenced to seven years in
prison Wednesday for mayhem and assault with a deadly weapon,
stemming from the May 11 maiming of Calvin O'Daniels, 62, a
building inspector who told him his fence was too tall.
   Superior Court Judge Meredith Taylor imposed the maximum term
after a letter from Duran was read in court that said O'Daniels
``is complaining about his eye. He is lucky he didn't get shot
instead. ...''
   Duran also wrote that the city inspector ``came to rearrange my
attitude. Believe me, he tried. He got his face rearranged,
instead.''
   The letter then asked for leniency in sentencing.
   ``I believe Mr. Duran is smugly satisfied with what he did,''
Ms. Taylor said as she handed down his sentence.
   Duran, who was convicted March 29, was also fined $5,000
Wednesday. He yelled, ``I won't pay a damn penny to this court,''
as he was taken into custody.
   According to trial testimony, O'Daniels' right eye had to be
removed and he lost half the sight in his left eye after Duran beat
him with his fists and a shoe.
   Duran maintained throughout the trial that O'Daniels had started
the fight after demanding a bribe.
   Duran's wife, Theresa, and his two children wept during the
sentencing. They each wrote letters to the judge saying Duran is a
model husband and father.
   Duran will be eligible for parole in 3{ years.

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis today signed into law a
bill that will make Massachusetts ``the nation's laboratory'' in
ensuring that health insurance is available to all residents by
1992.
   Dukakis, who has cited the measure in his campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination, said the first-in-the-nation
law will ``erase the uncertainty too many people face when they or
a loved one becomes ill but lack the means to pay for the cure.''
   In written remarks for an elaborate Statehouse signing ceremony,
the governor said, ``We have good reason to rejoice today, as we
again become the nation's laboratory.''
   The proposal makes Massachusetts ``the nation's pathfinder
blazing a trail that leads to affordable quality health care for
every man, woman and child.''
   ``We have made a start here at home,'' he said. ``Now we must
make it work. And then we must carry the message of health care for
all across the country so that the other 49 states join us.''
   Only Hawaii, which has a federal exemption allowing it to
mandate employer health coverage, currently has anything comparable
to the Massachusetts law.
   However, the new legislation, which Statehouse aides say has
generated inquiries from more than 20 states, goes beyond Hawaii's
approach by offering health security both to working and
non-working residents.
   The Massachusetts proposal to make health insurance available to
all by 1992 will cost the state $645.2 million over the next five
years, according to figures released Wednesday by Dukakis.
   The bill, the outcome of a nine-month legislative struggle,
comes two years after Massachusetts voters endorsed a non-binding
referendum by a 2-1 margin urging Congress to ``enact a national
health care program (that) ... is universal in coverage.''
   The thrust of the bill is to provide coverage to an estimated
600,000 Massachusetts residents under age 65 currently without
health insurance _ about one out of every 10 people in the
commonwealth.
   The plan is to do this in stages and through a variety of
approaches _ from extending Medicaid benefits for disabled adults
and children to state-brokered pooled insurance for small
businesses and individuals.
   Dukakis health policy adviser Catherine Dunham said she hopes
the coverage will begin operations July 1, the start of the fiscal
year.
   The plan passed the Legislature last week by narrow margins
blamed on the deletion of some special interest amendments and
lingering doubts about how much the law will cost.
   Although fully prepared to sign the law, Dukakis as late as
Tuesday was telling reporters he didn't know the bill's ultimate
cost. Dukakis acknowledged Wednesday that there had been ``some
confusion'' about health care costs.
   ``Sorry I didn't have the information yesterday. But I'm not a
technocrat, I'm a leader,'' Dukakis said, joking about his national
image as a dispassionate, hands-on manager.
   On Tuesday, the governor swept to victory in New York's primary,
solidifying his chances of becoming the party's nominee in next
fall's presidential election.
   Even the chief drafters of the bill, the Senate and House Ways
and Means committees, were unable to agree on the measure's cost.
The Senate placed the state's cost at about $550 million and the
House estimated it as high as $1.2 billion.
   Dukakis presented figures Wednesday showing the state's share of
the plan would rise from $34.5 million this fiscal year to $195.4
million in fiscal 1991.
   The state's share is expected to drop to $162.7 million in
fiscal 1992, according to the governor's figures. But Dukakis and
Dunham said state costs beyond fiscal 1989 are hard to estimate
because they will depend on how many employers decide to offer
health plans as a result of the law.

<TEXT>
   A woman who was arrested after failing to
return seven overdue library books says that she did return the
books, but authorities said today that five were still missing.
   Lorelei Bennett, 33, was arrested when she failed to acknowledge
a summons to appear in court to answer the charge of unauthorized
use of property, Kennebec County District Attorney David Crook said.
   ``It's unfortunate this had to go as far as it did,'' Oakland
police Sgt. Ralph Sabins said today. ``But when you fail to appear
in court it's more or less contempt of court and (authorities) have
to take action.''
   Bennett was released Tuesday on $54.80 bond, which included a
fee for the books, Sabins said.
   Bennett said police told her she would not have to answer the
summons if she returned the books, so she put five books in the
library's overnight deposit box. Two more books were later added to
the list of overdue books.
   Sabins said five of books were still missing today and that two
of those that were returned were badly damaged.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, leading Jesse
Jackson in the Democratic presidential race, said today that
finishing second in the primaries does not entitle anyone to second
spot on the national ticket. He said that he alone, if nominated,
will pick his running mate.
   ``What you're looking for is somebody who, first and foremost,
could be a first-rate president if something happened to the
president. That's where you begin,'' Dukakis said in an interview
with The Associated Press.
   ``If I were to finish second, it wouldn't entitle me to anything
more than consideration, period,'' Dukakis said.
   He refused to discuss any individuals and tried to steer
questions about the vice presidency away from Jackson.
   ``I have spent literally zero time thinking about it. And I will
not, unless and until I have either won the nomination or it looks
as if it's pretty well in hand,'' Dukakis said.
   ``If that happens, then I will begin what I hope will be a
thoughtful and thorough process of selecting a running mate. But
I'm not going to do anything on that _ quite literally _ until the
California and New Jersey primaries are over,'' he continued.
   Dukakis, who leads in nominating delegates and in popular votes,
was asked about a statement from Jackson campaign manager Gerald
Austin that if Dukakis won the nomination the runner-up would
deserve ``consideration'' for the second spot on the ticket.
   ``The nominee makes that decision _ as he (Jackson) himself
said. And rightly so,'' Dukakis said.
   Since his solid victory in the New York primary over Jackson and
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. on Tuesday, Dukakis has become the focus of
speculation about his choice for a vice president.
   According to aides, Jackson and Dukakis have not discussed the
issue in any of their private conversations. Publicly, both men
insist that the question is premature until the nominating process
has produced a Democratic nominee.
   Dukakis was leaving tonight for Pennsylvania and Ohio for
campaign stops. Pennsylvania's primary is Tuesday; Ohio's is a week
later. The governor had events scheduled this evening in Pittsburgh
and Cleveland.
   Dukakis, who has been spending three to four weekdays in the
Statehouse each week while running his Democratic presidential
campaign, noted Wednesday that Vice President George Bush isn't in
a position to campaign full time either.
   ``I would assume and expect that the vice president has to spend
some substantial portion of his week making sure he knows what's
going on, that he's fully briefed,'' Dukakis told reporters at a
Statehouse news conference. ``So both of us have the same problem.''
   Dukakis, who bested Jackson by 14 percentage points in New York,
was treated like a conquering hero when he came back to Boston.
   Dozens of Statehouse staffers thronged the governor's outer
office shortly after noon and let out a cheer for the governor and
his wife, Kitty.
   ``We love you all,'' Dukakis responded.
   Later, at a Statehouse reception marking the enactment of a
state highway package, he won warm cheers from the legislators and
contractors assembled for the event.
   Transportation Secretary Frederic Salvucci introduced Dukakis as
``the next president of the United States.'' Dukakis grinned but
cautioned, ``Steady as she goes.''

<HEAD>One Man Shot In `Rock House' Sweep</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have resumed the use of battering rams
to bust fortified ``rock houses'' of alleged drug dealers, and one
suspect was shot when he pointed a gun at officers, authorities
said.
   L.C. Hadnott, 71, of Los Angeles, was in surgery Thursday at
California Medical Center, said administrative supervisor Marlene
Delp. Doctors were not sure whether his arm could be saved, she
said.
   The shooting in South Central Los Angeles occurred just after
the sweep of three alleged sites of rock cocaine sales began late
Wednesday, said police Officer Jim Farris.
   ``The elderly suspect was carrying a shotgun when officers broke
into the house where narcotics were being sold and pointed the
weapon at them,'' Farris said. ``One of our officers responded by
firing his shotgun, injuring the suspect.''
   Hadnott was arrested for investigation of assault with a deadly
weapon on a police officer, Farris said.
   Pamela Perkins, 26, of Los Angeles was also arrested. She was
booked for investigation of felony drug possession, Farris said.
   Police seized a small amount of drugs, three shotguns, two
pistols and a rifle in the raids, Farris said.
   The houses had been linked to violent street gangs, Farris said,
but he couldn't tie the suspects to a gang.
   The ``rock houses'' where dealers sell the type of cocaine known
as ``rock'' or ``crack,'' are primarily in impoverished
South-Central neighborhoods.
   Police began using the motorized battering ram because the
metal-fortified doors and windows made it difficult to get inside
to serve search warrants. Following court challenges by
civil-rights groups, police must now obtain a judge's permission
each time they want to use the ram.

<HEAD>Agent Turns Gray When Courthouse Metal Detector Finds Slug in
Jacket Lining</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 3 grafs after 5th graf, `Singer, clan ...,' with
morning testimony.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An FBI agent learned how close he had come
to being killed in a shootout with a polygamist clan when a
.30-caliber slug was found in his jacket during a courthouse
security check.
   Agent Donald C. Roberts ``turned three ugly shades of gray''
Wednesday when the X-ray at the courthouse door found the slug in
the lining of his flight jacket, said Assistant U.S. Attorney David
Schwendiman. ``He was shocked.''
   Roberts, who had come to court to testify against members of the
clan, took the coat to the U.S. attorney's office and the slug was
cut out of the lining.
   The slug will be compared with six spent rounds retrieved at the
scene of the shootout and two .30-caliber rifles found in the
bedroom of defendant John Timothy Singer, U.S. Attorney Brent Ward
said.
   Singer, clan leader Addam Swapp, 27, matriarch Vickie Singer,
44, and Swapp's brother Jonathan Swapp, 20, are standing trial on
federal charges stemming from the Jan. 16 bombing of a Mormon
chapel and 13-day standoff that ended in the shootout.
   Today, the jury put on headphones for the second time in the
trial and watched on a television monitor a videotape of the
shootout that was taken by Summit County Reserve Deputy Grant J.
Evans, who had been stationed 500 yards away from the Singer
compound.
   The tape did not show any individuals running or shooting, but a
sequence of 11 gunshots was heard along with the deputy's surprised
reaction, ``Jesus Christ!'' The tape was a two-minute excerpt from
Evans' coverage of the gun battle.
   Summit County Detective Joe Offret, who had testified earlier,
was recalled to the stand. Offret said he was the first officer to
inspect the home where the FBI arrest team was stationed during the
shootout. When he examined the site, he found five .30-caliber
bullets, a number of bullet strike marks and a 9-mm casing.
   The gunbattle occurred as agents were attempting to capture the
Swapp brothers with attack dogs. State Corrections Lt. Fred House
was killed and Addam Swapp was wounded.
   Roberts had been with a team of surveillance agents stationed in
the home of Don and Miriam Jepsen when a second FBI team
implemented the arrest plan.
   Roberts said he was watching through a window when the Swapp
brothers walked back to the main Singer residence from a goat pen
and the order was given to release the dogs.
   Seconds later, Roberts testified, he heard a ``loud explosion of
gunshot immediately in front of my face'' and felt a sharp pain in
his upper chest.
   ``I recalled saying, `I'm hit! I'm hit!''' Another agent jumped
on Roberts and began searching for wounds but none was found.
Roberts then resumed his position in front of the window, he said.
   No bullet marks were found on the jacket or on his body armour
vest at the time, Roberts said, and he thought he had been hit by a
fragment of a wall.
   ``It was my impression that had I been hit with a bullet, it
would've penetrated the vest ... and I would not be here today,''
Roberts said.
   Earlier Wednesday, an FBI agent stationed with Roberts in the
Jepsen house testified that Jonathan Swapp pointed a rifle at him.
Agent Hal G. Metcalfe said Swapp knelt in the snow and aimed, but
the agent recalled seeing no muzzle flashes.
   ``I said to everybody, `Get down, get down. He's shooting at
us,''' Metcalfe said.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz assured two
dozen Jewish refuseniks and other Soviets with human rights
complaints Thursday that President Reagan and his successor will
champion their cause.
   ``It's built into us,'' Shultz said at a gathering at the U.S.
Embassy after listening patiently to stories of refused visas,
separated families and scientists who long ago stopped doing
sensitive work for the Soviet government.
   He also gave human rights ``the pride of place'' on his agenda,
leading off with the subject at his meeting with Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   ``I have to keep working at this, to keep striving, to never
give up,'' Shultz said.
   With a quaver in his voice, he continued: ``I can promise you
that the president, and whoever succeeds him _ it' built into us _
will keep working at these human rights problems.''
   Shultz said he would pursue the subject Friday with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   At about the same time that he was meeting with the refuseniks
invited to the embassy, others trying to press their emigration
appeals in a demonstration at the Lenin Library were dragged away
and taken to a police station in buses.
   The crackdown on an unsanctioned public protest may have been
intended as a warning against such demonstrations during Reagan's
visit here next month.
   Jewish emigration in March hit a 15-month high with 984 people
leaving the country. But Shultz is trying to force radical changes
in the way the Soviets handle applications for exit permits.
   He wants to ease the restriction on people who dealt with
classified subjects so they could not be denied visas for work done
many years in the past.
   And he wants the Soviets to stop permitting a family member to
block another adult's visa.
   Chicago-born Abe Stolar, a U.S. citizen, was a case in point.
Stolar will not emigrate unless his son, Michael, and
daughter-in-law, Julia, are granted visas, too.
   But Julia Stolar said her mother, from whom she is estranged,
has blocked her application, and thus kept all three Stolars from
leaving.
   As Shultz made his way around the living room of Max Robinson,
the U.S. consul general, people stepped forward to tell their
stories.
   Vladimir Tufeld, whose wife is in Johns Hopkins hospital in
Baltimore recovering from brain surgery, has been denied a visa for
11 years. He is an engineer who said he was last involved in
sensitive work 15 years ago.
   ``It's absolutely a lame excuse,'' Shultz told him.
   Tufeld carried color photographs of his son, a professor at
Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and his grandson.
   Benjamin Charny, a mathematician who said he worked on a space
program more than 17 years ago, has been refused a visa for nine
years. His family lives in Massachusetts.
   Lev Sheiba, a physicist from Leningrad, smiled and said his
daughter left two days ago, but he is still waiting for a visa.
   ``We are all hostages,'' Sheiba said. ``We are subjects for
bargaining.``
   Last year, at Passover, Shultz attended a Jewish seder at the
U.S. embassy. Several of the guests, including pianist Vladimir
Feltsman, have since left.
   He met two weeks ago in Jerusalem with a group of emigres,
including long-time refusenik Vladimir Slepak.
   Shultz offered their experience as a symbol of hope.
   ``I'd like to meet you again,'' he said. ``But not necessarily
here.''

   Civil rights and assault complaints
were issued against two white men allegedly involved in an attack
on a black man and a white woman who are students at the University
of Massachusetts.
   Court officials said the complaints against William McPhail, a
student who withdrew following the incident, and Daniel Johnson, a
campus visitor, were made public after the defendants signed them
Wednesday.
   The two are to be arraigned May 19 on one count each of assault
and battery on Sarah Whittle; assault and battery with a dangerous
weapon, a foot, on Jerome Smith; and assault and battery on Smith
for purposes of racial intimidation.
   Campus police said at the time of the February incident that
Whittle, Smith and a third black student were involved in a scuffle
with six white men as they were walking across campus following a
party.
   The incident sparked a six-day takeover of a campus building by
minority students.

<HEAD>McMartin Mass Molestation Trial Enters Second Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The McMartin Preschool molestation trial
started 368 days, 42 witnesses and $8 million ago, and attorneys
say it is likely to last at least a year more.
   And that doesn't include the 18-month preliminary hearing.
   ``Welcome to the year No. 2 of our trial,'' Superior Court Judge
William Pounders said Wednesday. The judge and attorneys then spent
an hour renumbering photographic evidence.
   Since jury selection started April 20, 1987, there have been
32,134 pages of transcript logged in Pounders' courtroom. Leap year
added an extra day.
   The prosecution, taking testimony from its 42nd witness, is
expected to rest its case late this summer. The defense has said it
hopes to take less than a year to present its side.
   Raymond Buckey, 29, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 61,
are charged jointly with one count of conspiracy and separately
with 99 counts of molestation between them.
   The charges center on 14 children who were under their care at
the McMartin Pre-School in suburban Manhattan Beach.
   Charges against five other teachers were dropped in 1986.
   In court, there have been allegations of satanic rituals, animal
butchery, perjury, suppression of evidence and coaching of
witnesses. One witness was jailed for failing to show up to
testify, and another committed suicide the day he was to testify.
   Mrs. Buckey is free on bail but her son remains in custody, his
bail set at $3 million.
   Pounders has been praised for his control of the trial so far.
   ``I think this judge has made a difference as far as recognizing
and understanding the needs of the victims,'' said Deputy District
Attorney Lael Rubin.
   Six children testified during the first year of the trial.
Defense attorneys claim many of their answers were coached.
   A 13-year-old was asked Wednesday whether the ``secret room''
where he said he was molested was actually a classroom.
   ``I'm leaving open the possibility, but I don't remember it
being a place where children are taught,'' the child answered.
   ``The kids appear to have been so prepped for trial, their
testimony has been weakened,'' said attorney Dean Gits. ``There is
little or no spontaneity.''
   Seven children have yet to testify. The parents of the 14th
alleged victim have refused to let their child take the stand.

<HEAD>California High Court Says Limit on Damages Doesn't Apply to
Pending Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court dealt a
multimillion-dollar setback to businesses and insurers today,
ruling that the 1986 ``deep pockets'' initiative, which limited
damages for pain and suffering, did not apply to cases pending when
the measure passed.
   The 4-3 ruling was a victory for injury victims and their
lawyers in cases where the harm had occurred but the lawsuits had
not yet been completed by June 1986, when state voters approved
Proposition 51 by a 62 percent majority.
   One class of cases particularly affected by today's ruling is
asbestos lawsuits, many of which had been filed but not settled by
June 1986.
   The court ruled that the initiative was constitutional,
rejecting trial lawyers' claims that it discriminated unfairly
against injury victims. But in the key portion of the ruling, the
majority said the measure's new standards for determining
non-economic damages applied only to injuries suffered after the
initiative passed.
   The opinion by Justice John Arguelles cited ``the common-sense
notion that it may be unfair to change the rules of the game in the
middle of the contest.'' He also said new laws are generally
presumed to apply only to future cases.
   Proposition 51, sponsored by businesses, insurers and local
governments and opposed by trial lawyers, limits a defendant's
share of non-economic damages _ pain, suffering and emotional
distress _ to its percentage of the total fault.
   Under the initiative, if a company that is 40 percent
responsible for an injury, for example, has gone out of business by
the time of suit, the victim can collect no more than 60 percent of
the non-economic damages from the remaining defendants.
   Economic damages, such as medical costs and lost wages, are
still covered by the longstanding ``deep pockets'' rule, under
which one or all of the remaining defendants can be required to pay
100 percent of the costs.

   A homeless man embittered about cuts
in his pension payments on Thursday seriously damaged three
paintings by German master Albrecht Duerer by spraying them with
sulfuric acid from a champagne bottle.
   Art restoration experts worked feverishly to save the
multimillion-dollar paintings.
   A 51-year-old homeless pensioner turned himself in to officials
at Munich's Alte Pinakothek museum after spraying sulfuric acid on
the Duerer classics ``Mourning of Christ'' and the ``Paumgartner
Altar,'' police said.
   Duerer, considered the most influential artist of the German
school, painted the works between 1496 and 1504.
   He told police he destroyed the paintings ``out of revenge''
because of decreases in his pension payments. Deductions had been
made from the man's pension to pay for similar attacks he made on
paintings in Duesseldorf and Hamburg, police said.
   The man described himself to police as ``psychologically
disturbed,'' according to police officials who asked not to be
identified, citing policy.
   Meanwhile, a Bavaria state art administration director told The
Associated Press that the damage done to the works was ``very
distressing.''
   ``The Altar alone is worth 70 million marks (about $40 million).
The value has sunk by at least 30 percent,'' said Hubertus von
Sonnenburg, director of the Bavaria state painting collections
organization. ``But in terms of art history you can't even assess
this damage.
   ``The paintings can certainly be restored. But there were so
many damaged areas _ one can never paint them over again so than
one doesn't see them,'' Sonnenberg added.
   Police said the pictures were as much as 70 percent destroyed.
   Art restoration experts from Munich's Doerner Institute rushed
to the museum shortly after the 10 a.m. attack.
   The paintings will have to dry out for at least two months
before the specialists can begin restoration work, said institute
chemist Johann Koller.
   The embittered pensioner was described by witnesses as a
``well-dressed gentleman'' who appeared to be just an ordinary
museum visitor. A school group came upon him as he stood before the
Duerer works, spraying the pictures with acid from a small
champagne bottle.
   When a pupil cried out to stop him, the man calmly put away the
bottle and turned himself in to museum officials, witnesses said.

   Jean Gascon, the French-Canadian actor
and director who served as artistic director of the Stratford
Festival in Ontario from 1969 to 1974, has died at the age of 67.
   Gascon fell ill this month while directing a production of ``My
Fair Lady'' for the 1988 Stratford Festival. He died of heart
failure Wednesday night.
   A former director of theater at the National Arts Center in
Ottawa, Gascon was born and raised in Montreal, the sixth of 14

   The 2-month-old son of a part-time U.S. marshal
was taken from his stroller on a city street by kidnappers who
lured his mother out of her house with a phony telephone call,
police said.
   ``We have no motive, no ransom demand, no witnesses, no
nothing,'' said police Sgt. John Mack. The kidnappers of Stephen
Gentile have not contacted the infant's family since he was taken
shortly before noon Wednesday, he added.
   The infant's father, John Gentile, retired from the Conrail
police force in 1984 with a disability, and now works part-time as
a guard for the marshal's office.
   However, investigators expressed doubt that Gentile's work was
linked to the kidnapping.
   ``His work in Conrail was routine police work,'' Mack said.
``His work with the marshal's service is minor.''
   According to police, Lucrezia Gentile received a telephone call
about 1{ hours before the abduction from a woman who told her that
her 7-year-old son, John, was ill at school.
   Mrs. Gentile put Stephen in his stroller and started walking
toward St. Ephram's School in Brooklyn, the sergeant said.
Suddenly, two men in a black sedan pulled up and the passenger got
out to ask for directions.
   ``The driver of the vehicle walked around the car, and grabbed
the baby from the stroller,'' Mack said. As the mother screamed,
the men fled.
   ``Other than ask directions, they didn't say a word,'' Mack said.
   The distraught mother failed to get the car's make or license
plate number, the detective said.
   Investigators determined the call from the school was fake.
   Meanwhile in Holbrook, Ariz., a 4-hour-old baby was found today
after being kidnapped Wednesday night from a Prescott hospital. A
woman who claimed to be a laboratory technician took the newborn
from his mother's arms, authorities said.
   A Holbrook police officer making a check of a parked car found
the kidnapped infant. The baby also was the officer's godchild,
police said.
   Two people were arrested for investigation of kidnapping, police
said.
   ``The baby was still wearing hospital garments,'' said Holbrook
police Sgt. Stewart Bracke. ``The baby's fine.''
   Lisa Gerwitz was told Wednesday night that her son had to be
taken to the Yavapai Regional Medical Center's laboratory for
tests, said Prescott police Sgt. Bill Clayton.
   When Mrs. Gerwitz asked a nurse about 45 minutes later where her
baby was, authorities realized the infant had been kidnapped,
Clayton said.
   Prescott is approximately 170 miles west of Holbrook.
   Bracke said Officer Douglas Newton, who discovered the baby in
backseat of the parked car, knew the kidnapped baby's parents from
high school.

<HEAD>Japanese Police Ask Interpol to Help Seek Red Army Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Police Agency has asked Interpol to
aid the hunt for 26 suspected members of the Japanese Red Army to
try to prevent terrorist acts during the 1988 Olympics, an agency
official said Thursday.
   A list naming the 26 was sent Wednesday to Paris-based Interpol,
the International Criminal Police Organization, said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said the list included updated portraits of seven members
based on information obtained recently by the Japanese police
agency.
   The official said police feared the revolutionary group would
carry out terrorist acts inside and outside Japan because of the
Olympic Games in neighboring South Korea.
   He said the request would help the search for Red Army members
in each of Interpol's 146 member nations.
   The National Police Agency also plans to distribute 10,000
posters and leaflets describing the wanted members to Japanese
embassies and offices of local companies abroad, including
airports, the official said.
   He said the list includes Fusako Shigenobu, 42, suspected of
masterminding the 1972 machine gun attacks at Tel Aviv's Lod
Airport that killed 28 people.
   Police in Naples, Italy, said Ms. Shigenobu may have been
involved in the explosion of a car bomb car outside a U.S. military
club in Naples last week. The blast killed an American servicewoman
and four Italians.
   Junzo Okudaira, another Red Army member, also is on the
international wanted list because he is suspected in the bombing,
the official said.
   The Asahi Evening News quoted an unidentified police official as
saying the Red Army sent a letter to a news agency in West Beirut
on Saturday saying it and Okudaira were not involved in the
bombing. The police official refused comment.
   He said Takamaro Tamiya, 45, who led a hijacking of a Japanese
domestic airliner to North Korea, also is on the Interpol list.
   Tamiya and eight other Red Army members hijacked an All Nippon
Airways jetliner in September 1970 and fled to North Korea after
freeing all the passengers.
   News reports said one of the hijackers recently died in North
Korea but did not give the cause of death.
   The Japanese police official said police were aware of a letter
that Tamiya apparently sent to Japanese news media last month. The
letter said that the remaining members in North Korea would ``go
anywhere if ordered'' to participate in terrorist acts.
   The officer declined to provide further details.
   The Foreign Ministry has said that a Japanese arrested April 12
on the New Jersey Turnpike with pipe bombs in his car also is
suspected of being a member of the Red Army.
   The Red Army is a radical leftist group formed in 1969 calling
for ``simultaneous world revolution.'' It was thought to have had
about 300 members at its peak. About 40 members are believed allied
with pro-Palestinian groups in Lebanon.

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham, ousted from
office April 4 by the Senate, will be a delegate to the state GOP
convention and hopes to be picked as one of Arizona's 33 delegates
to the Republican National Convention.
   ``Of course,'' he replied with a smile Wednesday night when
asked whether he'd expected to be sent to the state convention from
his district meeting.
   As a precinct committeeman, Mecham automatically was among the
182 candidates on the ballot in his district for 38 slots at the
May 14 state meeting.
   He garnered 61 of 102 possible votes, and word of his win was
greeted with applause.
   Mecham, who has clashed with much of the state GOP's hierarchy,
said he had not tried to count votes in advance of the district
meeting.
   ``Heavens, if I've got to line up votes, I'm not interested in
going,'' he said. ``If I haven't earned the right to go to the
(national) convention, our party is in bad shape.''
   Mecham's name was on the list recommended by the Rev. Pat
Robertson's campaign but was omitted from the list of
recommendations circulated by supporters of Vice President George
Bush, who already has enough delegates from other states to ensure
nomination.
   The former governor said he expected to back Bush eventually,
calling him ``the only show in town.''
   Even if Mecham doesn't win a seat as a delegate to the national
convention, he probably could get in as a former GOP governor,
state chairman Burton Kruglick said.

<HEAD>Leading Candidates Already Looking To Debate And Second Round</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand and Premier Jacques
Chirac, leading candidates in the first round of the presidential
election Sunday, have piqued other hopefuls by arguing over terms
of a one-on-one debate.
   As the official campaign entered its last two days Thursday,
both the 71-year-old Socialist president and his 55-year-old
conservative premier already were setting their sights on the May 8
runoff.
   That attitude did not sit well with former center-right Premier
Raymond Barre, 64, running third in the polls.
   ``The game is not over,'' said Barre, adding he believed it was
``presumptuous, not to say curious'' for his competitors ``to set a
date for a debate before the French people have decided.''
   George Marchais, the Communist Party secretary-general,
expressed the frustration of other candidates: ``The day before
yesterday, yesterday and today, one question occupies the radio and
television commentaries: the Mitterrand-Chirac debate between the
first and second rounds.''
   ``In other words, the first round is already over,'' said
Marchais, whose party's candidate is Andre Lajoinie.
   French elections are run in two rounds. If, as expected, no
candidate wins an absolute majority Sunday, the two top
vote-getters face each other in a runoff.
   Under French law, no polls are allowed to be published in the
week immediately preceding an election. The last polls showed
Mitterrand with comfortable lead at about 35 percent to 37 percent,
followed by Chirac with 22 percent to 24 percent. Barre is third
with about 17 percent and extreme right National Front leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen has 12 percent.
   There are five other candidates in the first round.
   The polls vary widely, and some show as much as 20 percent of
the vote undecided.
   As the campaign for the first round drew to a close, discussion
focused on the date and format for an eventual debate.
   Mitterrand said he thought Thursday of next week would be fine
but added any confrontation involving a president and a premier
should be dignified.
   On Thursday, Chirac rejected Mitterrand's proposed debate date
and preferred ``the beginning of the second week'' between the two
rounds.
   ``It is not for one candidate to set the date and summon the
other,'' the premier said. ``This debate must occur at a moment
when the French people are really mobilized.''
   Responding with thick irony, Mitterrand said he was very open
about the date, but at the moment, he had nobody to talk to.
   ``I must address myself to the different candidates who could be
present in the second round,'' he said. ``That is a difficult
conversation to have seriously before Sunday night.''
   The polls indicated Mitterrand would defeat either Chirac or
Barre in the second round, though the gap was narrowing.
   A televised debate, which has become a tradition in presidential
politics, is vastly more important to Chirac, who hopes it will
help him gain ground. Mitterrand has much more to lose and must
avoid a serious gaffe.
   Chirac, head of the conservative Rally for the Republic party,
is a tough debater. Mitterrand no doubt has not forgotten how
Chirac ran roughshod over former Socialist Premier Laurent Fabius
in a televised debate before the 1986 legislative elections.
   Chirac says he doesn't want an American-style debate with the
two men questioned separately by a panel of journalists. He wants a
head-on confrontation. Mitterrand would prefer a less direct method.
   Analysts have called the presidential campaign lackluster and
without any real discussion of the issues. Candidates have spoken
about ``priorities'' and ``general orientations,'' but none of them
has proposed any refreshing new ideas on how to tackle France's
economic and social problems.
   Mitterrand is seeking a second seven-year term in the Elysee
Palace. Chirac, who also served as premier from 1974-76 under
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, is making his second run for
the presidency. Barre, who replaced Chirac as Giscard's premier, is
running for the first time.
   Mitterrand defeated Giscard in the presidential election May 10,
1981.
   On Friday the two-week ``official campaign'' ends. During that
period, each candidate has a specifically allotted amount of time
on radio and television, and campaign meetings intensify.
   No political advertising is allowed on radio and television. On
Saturday before the election, no campaigning is permitted.
   There are 38.3 million eligible voters.

   The United States is still in the dark
regarding the whereabouts of the nine hijackers who killed two
passengers aboard a Kuwaiti plane before releasing the hostages,
the State Department said Thursday.
   The United States is in touch with the government of Algeria,
where the hijacking ended Wednesday, as well as with Kuwaiti
authorities. Most of the 31 hostages were Kuwaitis, and the
hijackers had demanded the release of 17 prisoners held by Kuwait
for terrorist bombings.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the United
States does not know whether a deal was struck with the hostages.
   ``We remain unaware of specific arrangements which were worked
out to lead to the end of the hijacking,'' she said.
   Kuwait reportedly agreed to commute the death sentences of three
of the 17 Moslems whose released was being demanded by the
hijackers in return for the hostages' release.
   The hijackers were reportedly flown to Lebanon.
   ``We don't know where the hijackers are. We remain in touch with
the government of Algeria on this matter,'' Mrs. Oakley said. ``We
are also in touch with a number of governments that share our
concerns about bringing terrorists to justice.''
   ``The United States will not rest until the terrorists, the
murderers, the hijackers are brought to justice. Our objective is
to make sure they do not go unpunished,'' she said.
   Mrs. Oakley said the United States is examining the possibility
of filing charges against the hijackers because one of the hostages
holds dual U.S.-Egyptian citizenship.

   Peter Calcott will leave his test tubes
behind this summer to help feed hogs on a farm as part of a
nationwide program to introduce scientists to the farmers they help.
   The reason for the pilot program, dubbed ``Adopt-a-Scientist,''
is that many scientists have never seen a farm and ``for all they
know, cotton grows in pots,'' says Ann Sorenson of the American
Farm Bureau Federation.
   Calcott is one of eight researchers from agricultural products
companies who will be matched with farmers across the country.
   ``We hope he gets ideas and sees the needs out here in the
country,'' said Carol Meyer, whose farm Calcott will visit. ``We
want him to see what we do so he'll know how vital his research
is.''
   Scientists will also be visiting farms in Illinois, New Jersey,
Texas, Mississippi, New York and perhaps other states.
   The farmers, in turn, may visit the scientists' labs to get a
better understanding of how technology can help them, said
Sorensen, assistant director of the Natural and Environmental
Resources Division of the Farm Bureau.
   Mrs. Meyer and her husband Glenn raise corn and soybeans, but
the main enterprise on their 240-acre Randolph County farm is hogs.
   Calcott works at Monsanto Co. in St. Louis on improving swine
nutrition and getting hogs to market weight more efficiently.
   ``I am a scientist _ involved all my life in laboratory work _
and I don't really have any on-farm experience with animals,'' said
Calcott, a native of London who has taught biochemistry and
molecular biology at universities.
   ``I want to understand issues that are important to the Meyers _
what improvements they need.''
   The scientists will be visiting at crucial times such as
planting and harvest.
   ``Farmers notice every little thing and they will point out
anything strange like a bug on a leaf _ and, sure enough it turns
out to be something new,'' said Sorensen. ``They can turn on a
lightbulb for the scientists.''
   Mrs. Meyer said she and her husband would show Calcott how they
raise corn and soybeans _ two important ingredients in livestock
rations _ and how they care for their hogs.
   ``We'll make him one of the family, and he'll do some of the
work,'' she said. ``We're excited about this. We just need a better
understanding among all of us in agriculture.''

  The FCC today ordered two California
dial-a-porn operators to pay fines totaling $1.2 million for
failing to restrict access of obscene messages to children and
nonconsenting adults.
   ``It's time we took steps. The ultimate in sleaze deserves the
ultimate ... penalty,'' said FCC Commissioner James H. Quello.
``They need to know we mean business.''
   The companies, Audio Enterprises, Inc., and Intercambio, Inc.,
were each fined $600,000 for violation of statues banning the
interstate transmission of obscene material and failure to restrict
such transmissions from minors and nonconsenting adults. The
maximum fine is $50,000 for each day of violation.
   An FCC spokesman, Gerald Brock, said the $600,000 fines were
based on the amount of money the companies made during the
commission's monitoring process.
   In an 11-month period, Audio Enterprises made $650,000 off calls
to one line, the spokesman said.
   Today's order resulted from an FCC investigation triggered by
complaints alleging that unimpeded access to the messages resulted
in the molestation of one 10-year-old girl and so disturbed one
teen he had to enter weekly psychiatric therapy.
   The companies have 30 days to pay or seek reduction of the fine.
   Earlier commission dial-a-porn rules had mandated the
``blocking'' of such messages through access codes, message
scrambling or use of credit card numbers.
   Upon being notified last December of the complaints, both
companies said they did not have the capacity to provide access
screening and denied the messages were obscene. Intercambio also
argued that it had not violated the regulation because it never
intended to transmit interstate or to minors.
   The commission staff is investigating complaints about two other
dial-a-porn companies, Ramrod Enterprises, Inc. and 2001
Enterprises.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo said Thursday
the 1988 Olympics in Seoul will force North Korea to change its
hardline communist policy and reopen a dialogue with South Korea.
   Roh said if North Korea changes its longstanding policy to make
the Korean peninsula communist through military force, South Korea
would move actively to improve relations.
   ``The Olympics are dictating changes in the situation of this
part of the world, and I, therefore, believe that North Korea's
policy would also inevitably change,'' Roh told a nationally
televised news conference.
   Roh said relations would reach an ``epochal turning point'' in
four or five years, and said he hoped he could lay a firm
foundation for unification.
   Despite the November bombing of a South Korean civilian airliner
in an attack South Korea blamed on North Korean agents, Seoul and
Pyongyang have been talking and must keep channels open, he said.
   Roh, who took office Feb. 25, did not say what channels the two
Korean states were using for dialogue. But he said, ``The most
effective way to solve problems is summit talks.''
   Roh's predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, proposed a summit with North
Korean President Kim Il-sung on many occasions, but the Pyongyang
government turned him down.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into communist North Korea and
anti-communist South Korea in 1945 at the end of World War II. They
fought a bloody civil war from 1950 to 1953.
   They have held intermittent talks since the early 1970s. Their
latest dialogue was broken off in 1986 when North Korea disputed a
major joint U.S.-South Korea military exercise.
   Relations took another nosedive last November when a Korean Air
jetliner disappeared near Burma, killing all 115 people on board.
   A North Korean agent in the custody of South Korean intelligence
authorities confessed in Seoul in January that she and a male agent
put a time bomb on the plane to disrupt the Olympics in Seoul.
   Roh deplored the bombing, but said his government still needs to
promote dialogue with North Korea to avoid a ``possibly more tragic
incident.''
   Roh also said increasing violence in the National Assembly
elections would be suppressed.
   ``Whoever violates the law and destroys democratic order must be
punished severely in the name of people,'' Roh said.
   Roh said his governing Democratic Justice Party needs a majority
in the 299-member National Assembly in elections next Tuesday.
   Top opposition leaders have said that if the party tries to rig
the elections, they will call for violent protests similar to those
in June that forced democratic reforms.
   ``The ruling party will face popular resistence and disobedience
if its irregularities and unfair campaigning continue,'' said
opposition leader Kim Dae-jung of the Party for Peace and Democracy.
   Rival opposition leader Kim Young-sam of the Reunification
Democratic Party said he would have to make a ``grave decision'' if
the government cheated.
   Roh was elected in December when the two Kims split the
opposition vote.
   Corruption and violence are among major campaign issues in the
legislative elections, the first test of public confidence in the
Roh government.
   Government officials say 15 people have been arrested for
involvement in campaign violence, including six members of Roh's
party. Another 120 people were charged but not jailed for violating
election laws, they said.
   In keeping with a campaign pledge, Roh publicly declared his
personal wealth at $693,000.
   The president also said he would lead a clean public life during
his single five-year term and would not tolerate any attempts by
his relatives to sell influence or make an illicit fortune during
his tenure.

   Jesse Jackson accepted defeat in New York as
he has accepted his wins and losses in other states _ graciously
and with a call for Democratic unity.
   He praised the campaign of the winner, Michael Dukakis, and said
that during the rest of the primary season there must be ``a
measure of competition, a measure of cooperation'' as the Democrats
``keep our eyes on the bigger prize'' _ victory in the November
general election.
   It was consistent with the high-toned campaign Jackson has
carefully crafted, in which he has stayed above the fray, even
during the past week when under attack by New York Mayor Edward
Koch.
   His demeanor has been noticed within the Democratic Party where
once he was considered a polarizing force.
   ``I think Democrats all over the country are giving Jackson high
marks for his conduct during the campaign,'' said William Carrick,
who managed Rep. Richard Gephardt's presidential campaign until the
Missouri congressman dropped out last month. In fact, Carrick said,
Jackson has had a unifying effect on the race.
   ``From the very beginning of the year, Jesse has tried to keep
to the high road. He has not been critical. It's been a deliberate
conscious effort,'' he said.
   Jackson in 1988 stands in contrast to the candidate who in
earlier years attacked Democratic party rules as exclusionary,
alienated Jewish voters and cavorted around the world grabbing the
spotlight by meeting with controversial figures including Cuba's
Fidel Castro and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega.
   ``In his earlier years he obviously was a protester. This time
he has grown tremendously and has grown into the protecter of the
high road,'' said Jackson adviser Bert Lance, who was a member of
former President Carter's inner circle.
   Jackson adviser Ann Lewis said many Democratic leaders had
commented to her about ``how tough it must have been not to
respond'' to Koch's assertions that Jews ``would have to be crazy''
to vote for Jackson, and Koch's allegation that Jackson lied about
his proximity to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. when King was slain in
1968.
   ``There's a real appreciation that he held back,'' said Lewis.
   And in fact, Jackson discussed it, she said. ``He said that it
was hard but he knew he was doing the right thing,'' and that he
had told her more than a year ago that he was determined not to
engage in negative campaigning.
   In New York, Jackson did say, ``Some people are making hysteria
while I'm making history.''
   The Jackson strategy, aimed at putting a Democrat in the White
House in November, also is devised to make Jackson a party insider
rather than the outsider he was in 1984.
   ``It's very important to him and his participation in the
campaign to be seen as a positive force for the party,'' Carrick
said.
   Jackson's campaign manager Gerald Austin said he saw a
``maturation process over the last four years,'' and said that
because of the way Jackson has conducted himself he is considered a
major player in party politics by the other major players.
   In debates among the Democratic contenders, Jackson has relished
the role of the peacemaker as some of his rivals squabbled. He has
insisted that Democrats should aim their fire at the Republicans,
and frequently contends internal party wrangling cost them the
White House in previous elections.
   Even after the Super Tuesday contests across the South, where
Jackson had reason to gloat after pulling the most votes and
polling second in the delegate count, he put in a plug for party
unity. He called on what was then a hefty field of Democratic
contenders not to ``self destruct'' by attacking one another.
   Not only does Jackson refrain from attacking his opponents, he
regularly telephones them, said campaign manager Austin.
   ``There's a kind of camaraderie that exists,'' he said.
   Jackson pledges that, as he did in 1984, he will work hard for
the Democratic ticket even if he is not on it.
   That would stand him in good stead down the road, especially if
a Democratic administration takes over. ``He's doing all the right
things for his future,'' Carrick said.
   Austin commented that Jackson, at 46, is still a young man, and
``he's going to be around for a long time.''

   President Reagan, five weeks before
meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, said today that the United States
and the Soviet Union cannot have ``a normal relationship'' unless
Moscow changes its ways and stops interfering in nations such as
Afghanistan.
   Reagan, in a wide-ranging speech on U.S.-Soviet ties, listed a
variety of concerns for both superpowers, including arms control,
the famine ravaging Ethiopia and the peace process in Central
America.
   On arms control, the president urged the Senate to ratify the
treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles, signed at the last
U.S.-Soviet summit, before he and Gorbachev meet May 29 in Moscow.
   He spoke hours after Senate majority Leader Robert C. Byrd said
the Senate won't rush to ratify the treaty despite White House
pressure to do so by the summit.
   The treaty is not scheduled to go to the Senate floor until May
9.
   Later, in a question-and-answer session with his audience at the
World Affairs Council meeting, Reagan said that it would be ``very
upsetting and would put a strain on the summit if the Senate has
not ratified the treaty by the time we go'' to Moscow.
   ``We hope and pray that they will, but their scheduling of it
has been such that I am very concerned we may have to go without
having had it ratified,'' he said.
   But, the president added, ``We don't want a fast treaty. We want
a good one.''
   As for relations with a nation Reagan once labeled ``the evil
empire,'' he said in his speech that ``the next few months will be
no time for complacency, no time to sit back and congratulate
ourselves.''
   The president said the Soviet Union can build trust only when it
stops interfering in other nations and improves its record of human
rights.
   ``Our policy is intended to nurture what you might call more
normal relations between East and West,'' Reagan said.
   He said that a Soviet Union that tramples on the rights of its
own people ``can never have truly normal relations with the United
States and the rest of the free world.
   ``Neither can a Soviet Union that is always trying to push its
way into other countries ever have a normal relationship with us.''
   Taking a positive note, Reagan said U.S.-Soviet relations ``have
taken a dramatic turn, into a period of realistic engagement. ...
The INF treaty is now a reality and now the Senate should give its
consent to ratification.''
   He added that progress has been made on limiting strategic
weapons as well.
   But Reagan warned that on regional issues, such as Afghanistan,
he wants to see deeds, not just words.
   ``They have often promised to leave (a country,) but rarely in
their history, and then only under pressure from the West, have
they actually done it,'' Reagan said. He added that the United
States believes that the Soviets ``still hope to prop up their
discredited, doomed puppet regime, and they still seek to pose a
threat to neighboring Pakistan, to whom we have a longstanding
defense commitment.''
   Reagan said it wasn't clear whether the Soviets have planned to
give up such ambitions, but that ``We must make clear that any
spreading of violence on the part of the Soviets or their puppets
could undo the good'' that was promised by the Geneva pact
outlining the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   The president reminded Gorbachev that unless he keeps his
promise to withdraw the Red Army, the United States will stand by
its ``hard and fast commitment'' to support the Afghan rebels.
   Reagan also demanded that the Soviets deal strongly with their
allies in Ethiopia and help food reach the hundreds of thousands of
starving there.
   ``They can stop this disaster before it happens,'' Reagan said,
appealing to the Soviets to persuade the Ethiopian government to
allow the international famine relief effort to continue despite
the ongoing civil war in that Northern African nation.
   As for Central America, Reagan criticized both the Soviets and
Congress for the situation in Nicaragua. He accused the Soviets
helped the leftist Sandinistas in ``stealing a democratic
revolution.'' Congress, he charged, had ``denied the freedom
fighters the support they need'' to force the Sandinistas to keep
their promises of democracy.
   Back in Washington, Byrd, addressing the INF treaty, told
reporters:
   ``We want a good treaty, that is our objective. ... ``I'm not
going to rush to judgment.''
   He said a continuing dispute over whether the new treaty bans
such futuristic weapons as those using laser rays or particle beam
generators must be resolved before the treaty can be considered.
   Byrd said he had discussed the issue of futuristic weapons with
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, who reported verbally on the panel's findings.
   He said he had asked Nunn to report more fully in writing.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze has said in a
letter to Secretary of State George Shultz that the Soviets agree
with the United States that the treaty bans futuristic weapons.
   On Wednesday, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that
failure to ratify the treaty before the summit could ``tend to
dampen'' prospects for progress at the summit on a long-range
missile accord.
   The White House spokesman nudged the Senate to speed up the
process as a parliamentary commission in Moscow on Wednesday
approved the treaty, setting the stage for Soviet ratification
before the summit.
   To have the INF treaty signed before the summit ``would be an
important boost to our negotiations'' on strategic weapons, he said.
   ``Similarly, if it's not signed, it would tend to dampen, I
think, the prospects for serious ... progress'' on a strategic
weapons treaty, Fitzwater added. ``It would not be helpful and we
would hope that the Congress would be able to ratify it before we
go.''
   Even if the INF treaty is ratified, administration officials
doubt that a strategic arms agreement will be ready for signing at
the summit.
   The INF treaty eliminates existing missiles with a range of 300
to 3,400 miles, but some senators have questioned how the pact
would affect weapons in that range that could be developed in the
future.
   Once the treaty is on the Senate floor, the agreement likely
will encounter stalling tactics from Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and
other foes.

   The pro-Iranian kidnappers of Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins said Thursday the Marine officer will be tried
on charges of spying for the United States.
   ``This criminal will be turned over today to the tribunal of the
oppressed to try him for the crimes he has committed,'' the
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth said in a typewritten
statement delivered to the Reuters news agency office.
   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was serving with a U.N. observer
group in south Lebanon when he was abducted by gunmen Feb. 17 near
the ancient port of Tyre, 50 miles south of Beirut.
   The statement came three days after the Christian-run Voice of
Lebanon radio station claimed Higgins was killed during clashes
between pro-Syrian and Iranian-backed Shiite militias in south
Lebanon earlier this month.
   It could not be known whether Thursday's communique was meant to
refute the radio report or set the stage for announcing Higgins'
death.
   Thursday's Arabic-language statement from the Shiite Moslem
group was accompanied by a black-and-white photograph of Higgins,
apparently to prove its authenticity.
   The picture showed the balding Higgins with a stubbled gray
beard, wearing a dark field jacket, his eyes looking down and away
from the camera. It was the first photograph of Higgins released by
his captors since his kidnapping. It was not known when it was
taken.
   The statement said among the charges Higgins faced was ``spying
for the criminal United States on our Lebanese and Palestinian
peoples'' and ``active participation in American conspiracies
against our Moslem people.''
   Higgins supervised a ``Pentagon team to combat Lebanese and
Palestinian Islamic organizations in Palestine and Lebanon,'' the
statement said.
   Both the United States and the United Nations have previously
denied earlier charges by the kidnappers that Higgins was spying
for the CIA.
   L. Paul Bremer, ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism, said
the kidnappers' latest charge ``is of course nonsense.
   ``Col. Higgins is not a spy. He was working for the United
Nations for a peaceful mission and we hold his hostage holders
responsible for his safety,'' Bremer told ``CBS This Morning.''
   In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman said a ``so-called
trial'' of Higgins ``can bring only further discredit to the
terrorists and their cause. ``The notion that the Organization for
the Oppressed on Earth ... has the right to try anyone is simply
grotesque,'' said spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   Higgins, the statement alleged, provided the Defense Department
with ``his personal views on the situation (in the south), which
include all military activities in resisting Israel and ways of
bringing them under control.''
   It claimed he was a member of what it called an American
coordination committee ``on Lebanon and Palestine'' made up of
officials from the Defense Department, the State Department and the
Central Intelligence Agency.
   The kidnappers released a videotape Feb. 22 in which the Vietnam
veteran and onetime aide to former Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger asked President Reagan to meet demands for his release.
   The kidnappers have demanded a full Israeli withdrawal from an
occupied enclave in south Lebanon and the release of all Lebanese
and Palestinian guerrillas held by Israel.
   The U.S. administration has refused to intervene with Israel
over the captors' demands and said Higgins' plea was made under
duress.
   Thursday's statement was the fourth from the group since it
claimed Feb. 19 that it had kidnapped him.
   Also Thursday, the wife of another American hostage, Alann
Steen, sent him her good wishes for his 49th birthday in an
advertisement published by the independent An-Nahar daily.
   Steen, a native of Boston, was a communications instructor at
the U.S.-affiliated Beirut University College when he was kidnapped
on Jan. 24 last year.
   ``Dearest Alann,'' said the published note from Virginia Rose
Steen, 30, of Jackson, Mich., who also works at the Beirut college.
``We love you dearly. We keep working and hoping with others that
you will be with us again soon.''
   There are nine Americans among the 22 foreigners held hostage in
Lebanon. Held the longest is American Terry Anderson, the chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. military said today that
unidentified intruders broke into an American military fuel storage
area near the Panama Canal for the third time in two weeks.
   Bill Ormsby, a civilian spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command,
said he did not know if sentries guarding the Arraijan Tank Farm
near Howard Air Force Base exchanged fire with intruders Wednesday
night.
   ``They are still being debriefed, and I don't have any details
myself,'' Ormsby said.
   However, Ormsby said he did not believe there were any injuries
in the incident. A Marine was killed in the first reported
intrusion on April 11 when he was shot by fellow guards.
   Ormsby said the 807-acre tank farm, about five miles west of
Panama City, was being guarded by members of the 193rd Light
Infantry Brigade, which is based in Panama.
   The soldiers replaced the Marines after the second reported
intrusion last week. In that incident, the Marines said they
engaged in a two-hour firefight with what they said were between 40
and 50 men dressed in black uniforms.
   The Marines involved in the first two break-ins had arrived in
Panama only the week before from Camp Lejeune, N.C., as part of a
1,300-man U.S. military build-up.
   The Panamanian government ridiculed U.S. accounts of the alleged
intrusions, saying the Marines had fired at ``swaying palm trees''
and shadows. It later filed a diplomatic protest over the incidents.
   The Southern Command still has not released a report of its
investigation into last week's incidents, but a source close to the
probe said it turned up ``no conclusive evidence.''
   The source, however, said small electronic sensors scattered
over the hilly, jungled reserve had detected the presence of
intruders, which tended to confirm the visual sightings reported by
the Marines.
   A Pentagon spokesman, Dan Howard, told reporters in Washington
early last week that the intruders appeared to be members of the
Panama Defense Forces.
   The Defense Forces are commanded by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
who is under criminal indictment in the United States on drug
trafficking charges. The Reagan Administration, along with civilian
opponents in Panama, has been seeking the general's ouster for
months.
   On Wednesday, the government revoked a month-old state of
emergency that curbed civil liberties after rebel soldiers
attempted to overthrow Noriega.
   The National Assembly voted to revoke the emergency decree at
the request of acting President Manuel Solis Palma, a local
television broadcast said. There was no immediate comment from the
government.
   The ``state of urgency'' permitted the Noriega-controlled
government to suspend a wide range of civil liberties, including
freedom of speech and assembly and the right to private property.
   The government invoked the decree on March 18, two days after
dissident officers tried to remove Noriega as head of Panama's
15,000-strong Defense Forces but failed and were captured.
   A U.S. military official said four high-ranking Panamanian
military officers would visit Fort McNair near Washington, D.C.
next week. High-ranking members of Noriega's staff are seldom
accessible to U.S. officials.
   In another development, Roderick Esquivel, ousted as vice
president by pro-Noriega lawmakers along with then-president Eric
Arturo Delvalle, appealed to Latin American governments to support
efforts to oust the general.
   In a letter released Wednesday, he said:
   ``We hope that the Latin American democracies will raise their
voice without euphemisms, show solidarity and help Panamanians to
break up this dangerous dictatorship.''
   The United States still recognizes Delvalle as the nation's
president.
   In February, Noriega was indicted on federal drug trafficking
charges in Florida. He has since successfully resisted U.S.
economic sanctions and an opposition campaign aimed at forcing him
out of office.

   Joseph Vignola is heavily favored to win the
Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate on Tuesday. If he does, his
problems have just started.
   The nominee will be going against the well-known and well-heeled
Republican incumbent, John Heinz III, and against tradition.
Pennsylvania has not sent a Democrat to the Senate since Joseph S.
Clark won in 1962.
   Vignola, the former Philadelphia city controller, is the
best-financed of the four Democratic candidates and has the
endorsement of the Democratic State Committee.
   Potter County Commissioner Susan Kefover is his only active
opponent, but she has raised barely more than $5,000. Vignola's
campaign raised $133,352 between January and April.
   The other two candidates are John Logue, a professor of
political science at Villanova University, and economic consultant
Steven S. Douglas.
   Logue, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic Senate
nomination in 1982, bills himself as the only Democrat who can beat
Heinz. He says he seeks to ``promote world peace, to protect the
environment and to lower the budget and trade deficits.''
   Kefover says people have lost faith in government.
   ``We have to start giving more control back to local government
officials _ to help bring that confidence back and get us all back
in shape,'' she said during a recent campaign stop in Lancaster
County.
   Douglas, 36, ran unsuccessfully in the 1986 gubernatorial
primary and was supported by the organization of Lyndon LaRouche,
the political extremist who had sought the presidency.
   Heinz, whose campaign had $1.8 million on hand as of April 6
compared to $48,013 for Vignola, has no primary opposition.
   A Heinz-Vignola race would shape up as a rerun of the 1986 race
between Republican Sen. Arlen Specter and Democrat Bob Edgar.
   In both cases, the Democrat is a liberal from Philadelphia
making his first run for statewide office against an incumbent
moderate Republican who is better known and better financed.
Specter won 57 percent of the vote against Edgar.
   Workers in the Heinz and Vignola campaigns said they knew of no
public opinion polls that had been taken before the primary.
   Vignola's aides acknowledged that any voter preference poll
would likely show that their candidate is not yet widely recognized
in the western half of the state, a common problem for Philadelphia
candidates.
   Vignola is already campaigning against Heinz, with lines such
as: ``We need a senator to represent the people on Main Street in
Pennsylvania, not Wall Street.''
   Heinz, heir to 57 varieties of money from the Pittsburgh-based
pickle packing company, served two terms in the House, then poured
$2.9 million of his own money to win his Senate seat in 1976.
   Heinz has been silent during the campaign, but his aides sprang
to his defense when Vignola claimed Heinz voted against a highway
contruction bill important to Pennsylvania's turnpike improvement
program.
   Vignola said Heinz was one of 17 senators who voted against the
bill, which ultimately was vetoed by President Reagan. However, the
records show Heinz was not among the 17 who voted ``nay'' March 19,
1987.
   Heinz was absent because his plane from Pittsburgh was delayed,
aides said. He had a notation placed in the official record that he
supported the bill.

<HEAD>Karpov Assured of Share of SWIFT Chess Title</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former world chess champion Anatoly
Karpov was assured of at least a share of the SWIFT World Cup
Tournament title on Thurslday when Briton John Nunn drew an
adjourned game.
   With one round remaining, Karpov has 10{ points out of a
possible 15. Nunn and Soviet Valery Salov are tied with 9{ points.
Another Soviet, Alexander Beliavsky, is fourth with nine points.
   Karpov, who did not play Thursday, is widely expected to agree
quickly to a draw in his last-round game with Swede Ulf Andersson
on Friday to finish alone in first place and take the $20,000 first
prize.
   Even if Karpov were to lose Friday, Nunn and Salov could only
tie for first place. A win scores one point and a draw a half.
   In the first of the adjourned games completed on Thursday,
Dutchman Jan Timman and Nunn maneuvered in an endgame for two hours
before agreeing to a draw.
   A second unfinished game between Soviet Andrei Sokolov and
Timman was drawn after only a few minutes play.
   Timman, the third-ranked player in the world, moved up to 10th
place in the 17-man competition.
   ``In many ways, the standings here reflect the situation in
world chess. The Soviets are leading with an Englishman second,''
said Gennadi Sosonko, a Dutch grandmaster.
   At the 1986 Chess Olympiad _ the world team championship _ the
Soviets came in first with England second and the United States
third.
   The $104,000 SWIFT tournament is the first of six events spread
over two years that make up the inaugural Chess World Cup.
   Organized by the 2-year-old Grandmasters Association, the events
feature the world's top 25 players and a prize fund of $1.2 million.
   Each of the 25 grandmasters will play four of the six tournament
and their best three finishes will make up their final standing.
   World Champion Garri Kasparov did not compete in the SWIFT
tournament. He opens his World Cup campaign in Belfort, France, in
June.
   In the battle for second place Friday, Nunn will face Ljubomir
Ljubojevic of Yugoslavia while Salov will play Gyula Sax of Hungary.

   Gore's campaign soared on Super Tuesday on March 8, when he
scored primary victories in Arkansas, Kentucky, North Carolina,
Oklahoma as well as his home state of Tennessee. But he was never
able to capitalize on his Southern success when the campaign turned
to the Midwestern and Northern states. When he got only 10 percent
of the New York primary vote on Tuesday, he decided to pull the
plug.
   Gore entered the race bidding to emerge as the type of moderate
Southern candidate who could permit the Democratic Party to capture
Southern states in the fall election.
   Nevada aside, virtually his only campaign success came in his
native region.
   ``I lost this race and that is a big disappointment,'' Gore said
as his wife Tipper and other members of his family stood by his
side.
   ``But some things matter to me more than winning. Helping my
party, serving my country, knowing when to keep fighting and
knowing when I've been licked.''
   Gore amassed 423 Democratic National Convention delegates during
his campaign, according to a count by The Associated Press. His
decision to suspend rather than formally quit the campaign means
they can attend the convention.
   Had he decided to withdraw, his delegates would have been
divided between Jackson and Dukakis.

   Michael Dukakis, the clear Democratic front-runner after beating
Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr. in New York, said today the
party's runner-up after the primaries won't necessarily be the vice
presidential choice. Gore, conceding ``things didn't turn out
exactly as I planned,'' suspended his campaign but said he would
hang on to the delegates he's won so far.
   ``I want no part of a stop-Jackson or stop-Dukakis movement. The
only man I want to stop is George Bush and we're going to stop
George Bush, Gore said, bringing applause from supporters at a news
conference in a Senate office building.
   ``Technically, I shall remain a candidate for the nomination but
only to enable my delegates to go to the convention so they can
represent our point of view in our party's deliberations,'' he said.
   Gore, the youngest candidate in the race, joked that in the
campaign, ``I was doing great until I turned 40.''
   Jackson, in Pennsylvania, brushed aside surveys suggesting he
faces an uphill fight in next week's primary in that state. ``I do
not follow opinion polls, I mold opinion,'' Jackson told cheering
supporters in Philadelphia.
   Gore's decision to merely suspend his campaign followed a
similar action by Sen. Paul Simon earlier.
   Both Dukakis and Jackson were campaigning today in Pennsylvania,
where 178 Democratic delegates are at stake on Tuesday. Dukakis was
going on to Ohio, which holds its primary a week later.
   Dukakis, asked about a potential running mate during an
interview with The Associated Press, said, ``I have spent literally
zero time thinking about it. And I will not, unless and until I
have either won the nomination or it looks as if it's pretty well
in hand.''
   Some Jackson backers were beginning to float the idea of Jackson
as a possible running mate if Dukakis were the nominee. ``There
would be lots of enthusiasm for that ticket,'' campaign chairman
Willie Brown told The New York Times.
   But Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk said such a
ticket was unlikely. Kirk, in comments published in today's Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, said, ``Only once in 19 elections since the
turn of the century has the nominee turned to the person who placed
second and asked him to run. It was 1960.''
   Dukakis himself said, ``If I were to finish second, it wouldn't
entitle me to anything more than consideration, period.''
   He refused to discuss any individuals and tried to steer
questions about the vice presidency away from Jackson.
   ``The nominee makes that decision _ as he (Jackson) himself
said. And rightly so,'' Dukakis said.
   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush continued his
march to the nomination, with 1,052 of the 1,139 delegates needed
to nominate.
   Bush was endorsed Wednesday by California Gov. George
Deukmejian, who had initially pledged neutrality through the June 7
California primary. But Bush's only remaining competitor is Pat
Robertson, who has all but halted his campaign.
   Simon's suspension of his Democratic presidential campaign
earlier this month drew fire from Jackson, who complained bitterly
about the Illinois' senator's decision to keep a lock on delegates
that would otherwise have gone to him.
   Jackson campaign spokesman Bob Brosage brushed aside talk of
Jackson as vice president. ``We're still running for president,''
he said. ``There are significant primaries to come.''
   And Jackson himself gave no indication he's giving up his drive
for the nomination.
   ``We have come a long way, and we will not turn back,'' he told
an enthusiastic crowd of 3,500 at a Philadelphia rally.
   Jackson was also picking up the endorsement today of the
Philadelphia Daily News. A survey commissioned by the newspaper, in
concert with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, suggested this week that
Dukakis had a 3-1 lead in the state.
   Even so, ``Jesse Jackson can win,'' the Daily News said in an
editorial.
   Financial reports filed with the Federal Election Commission
indicated Jackson had his best fund-raising month ever in March,
raising $2.8 million. But Dukakis, whose campaign has been well
bankrolled all along, raised $3.4 million during the same period.
   Jackson's stops in Pennsylvania today ranged from a high school
to a labor rally to a homeless shelter. Dukakis was heading for
Pittsburgh tonight, after spending a day in Boston following the
New York primary.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, at a Democratic dinner in Washington
Wednesday night, was eager to move beyond the raucous contest in
his home state.
   ``I expect the campaign will be converted to an intelligent,
civilized exchange of opinions,'' he said.
   Dukakis is comfortably ahead of Jackson in the delegate count,
getting a boost Wednesday from the selection of congressional
``super delegates.''
   The latest Associated Press delegate count gives Dukakis
1,063.15; Jackson 841.1; Gore 421.55; and uncommitted 613.75, out
of 2,081 needed to nominate.
   But Dukakis was doing his best to dampen any talk of
inevitability. When he was introduced at a Statehouse reception in
Massachusetts as ``the next president of the United States,'' he
grinned but quickly cautioned: ``Steady as she goes.''
   In one respect, however, Dukakis was behaving as if he were the
nominee, focusing attacks on Bush, who is all but certain to carry
the GOP banner in the fall.
   ``I'm a doer,'' Dukakis said Wednesday, saying that
characteristic stands in ``sharp contrast to the Republican
nominee.''

   Police who raided a bordello in this
coastal city on the Adriatic said they arrested a 94-year-old woman
and charged her with running the operation.
   Maria Enrica Sparvieri was arrested Wednesday on charges of
arranging for illicit sexual encounters and released on her own
recognizance.
   ``She's very sprightly; she had to be to run such a business,''
said the policeman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The policeman said about a half dozen women worked at the
bordello, but no one else was arrested in the raid.

<TEXT>
   A convicted sheep-rustler with a
cowboy's grudge against rules and regulations won a gaming license
Thursday for a tiny rural casino.
   Jimmy Williams, 57, was approved by the state Gaming Commission
for a six-month temporary license to run two slot machines and a
blackjack game at the Golden Club in the isolated town of Austin in
central Nevada.
   Commission Chairman John O'Reilly warned Williams, who inherited
a one-sixth interest in the club from his mother, that he would
have to adhere to tough gaming regulations.
   O'Reilly told Williams he would be wearing two hats: ``One is
your cowboy hat and one is your gaming hat.'' He added that
Williams must follow the rules even though he's in a remote area.
   Commissioner Bob Lewis told Williams his application was ``a
refreshing break from the others we had to read.''
   Williams had told the commission's investigative arm, the state
Gaming Control Board, that he had many conflicts with brand
inspectors, the Bureau of Land Management and other regulatory
agencies.
   Sometimes, he said, he pleaded guilty just to get out of courts
and back to the hills.
   Williams said he spent 10 months in prison in 1962 for rustling.
He said he had hauled another rancher's sheep out of an area where
they were interfering with a camp he was running, and simply
released them elsewhere.
   ``I'm still looking for those sheep,'' joked Commissioner Lewis,
who grew up in the same central Nevada area.

   Billionaires Harry and Leona Helmsley pleaded
innocent Thursday to federal charges of tax fraud.
   The real estate developer and his wife, the ``queen'' of the
Helmsley hotel chain's advertising campaign, pleaded not guilty to
similar state charges last week.
   The five-minute hearing before U.S. Magistrate Nina Gershon with
defense attorney Steven Kaufman calling the twin federal and state
indictments an unprecedented ``twofer _ two prosecutions based on
the same set of facts.''
   The Helmsleys, whose net worth is estimated to be $1.4 billion,
were released without bail, but must surrender their passports and
remain in the country pending trial. The same applied to two former
Helmsley employees who also entered please of innocent.
   The Helmsleys are due back in court April 29 for a hearing on
the indictment, which also charges Mrs. Helmsley with attempted
extortion.
   The federal charges accuse the Helmsleys of defrauding the
government of taxes by claiming by improperly deducting some $4
million in home renovation and other expenditures as business
expenses.
   Helmsley employee Frank Turco, 45, of Lutz, Fla., is charged
along with Mrs. Helmsley with attempted extortion of Helmsley
employees and contractors.
   Former Helmsley financial manager Joseph Licari, 51, of Oyster
Bay Cove was also named in both indictments.

   The capital's worst dust storm in 36 years shut
down Beijing's airport for several hours Thursday while pedestrians
used surgical masks and scarves to protect themselves from the
swirling yellow soil.
   The storms began April 2 and have continued intermittently
since, sometimes limiting visibility to a few hundred yards and
turning the Beijing sky, already gray from coal dust, to a chalky
yellow.
   ``The last time Beijing had such bad weather was 1952,'' said Li
Tingfu of the Beijing Meteorological Bureau.
   High winds carrying tons of the soil called loess swirl into
Beijing every spring from the arid plateaus northwest of the
capital.
   The storms have lessened in recent years due to anti-erosion
measures, such as planting thousands of trees to form a ``green
wall'' north of the city. But a lack of rain in Inner Mongolia and
Gansu province in northwestern China aggravated the problem.
   The airport has been forced to close at least twice due to poor
visibility. Cars, buildings and sidewalks were coated with fine
dust, which also seeped into homes and offices.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. said today he would
suspend his campaign for the 1988 Democratic nomination and said he
would do ``everything I can'' to elect a Democrat as the next
president.
   In a graceful exit, Gore said he would technically remain a
candidate to permit his delegates to attend the Democratic National
Convention.
   But, he said in room crowded with supporters, ``I want no part
of a stop Jackson or a stop Dukakis movement. The only man I want
to stop is George Bush and we're going to stop George Bush.''
   Gore exited with a joke after a failed campaign that he said
lasted 10 months and a million miles.
   ``I was doing great until I turned 40,'' the Tennessee senator
said.
   Gore's withdrawal leaves only front-runner Michael Dukakis and
Jesse Jackson as active candidates for the Democratic nomination.
   Gore's campaign soared on Super Tuesday on March 8, when he
scored primary victories in Arkansas, Kentucky, North Carolina,
Oklahoma as well as his home state of Tennessee. But he was never
able to capitalize on his Southern success when the campaign turned
to the Midwestern and Northern states. When he got only 10 percent
of the New York primary vote on Tuesday, he decided to pull the
plug.
   Gore entered the race bidding to emerge as the type of moderate
Southern candidate who could permit the Democratic Party to capture
Southern states in the fall election.
   Nevada aside, virtually his only campaign success came in his
native region.
   ``I lost this race and that is a disappointment,'' Gore said as
his wife Tipper and other members of his family stood by his side.
   ``But some things matter to me more than winning _ helping my
party, serving my country, knowing when to keep fighting and
knowing when I've been licked.''
   Gore amassed 423 Democratic National Convention delegates during
his campaign, according to a count by The Associated Press. His
decision to suspend rather than formally quit the campaign means
they can attend the convention.
   Had he decided to withdraw, his delegates would have been
divided between Jackson and Dukakis.
   Gore spent his final hours as an active candidate trying to
retire his huge debt.
   He went to Texas on Wednesday for a $1,000-a-person fund-raiser
to pay off some of the more than $1.5 million in debts the campaign
has run up.
   Arriving in Austin, Gore told reporters, ``I'm in the midst now
of consulting with friends and supporters all over the country and
asking for their advice on how we can best continue the cause for
which I have been fighting.''
   At the dinner, he did not say whether he would withdraw. But his
speech had the sound of a last hurrah.
   ``I have learned from my opponents. I believe they have learned
from me,'' he said.
   And he talked about turning attention to the general election.
   ``These next few weeks will be a time for unity and a time to
look forward to the fall election,'' he said.
   The Tennessee senator praised both Jackson and Dukakis. He said
Jackson has ``reclaimed our party's passion for social justice''
and that Dukakis has ``shown a steady hand through a long and
trying campaign.''
   ``They are both good men and formidable candidates,'' he said.
   Gore's strategy for winning the nomination was unusual and
ultimately unsuccessful.
   He skipped the opening Iowa caucuses, where his message as ``a
raging moderate'' was not well-received.
   Then his campaign waffled on how much of an effort to make in
New Hampshire _ where his issue positions found a receptive
audience. By the time the money was poured into the Granite State,
it was too late to affect the outcome and he finished fifth in a
seven-man field.
   ``I always felt like, if anybody could pass up Iowa and New
Hampshire, he could,'' said Kathy Vick, Louisiana Democratic Party
chairman. ``That he was an exception to the unwritten rule that you
had to play in Iowa and New Hampshire.''
   Gore proclaimed that he would ``jump-start'' his campaign in his
home region on March 8, the Super Tuesday when every Southern and
border state but one held primaries.
   He did well that day, but so did Dukakis and Jackson,
splintering the political benefits of the massive regional primary.
   After that, Gore could not find a place to make a stand. He
skipped Michigan and Connecticut, but then put a chunk of money
into Wisconsin, where he once again finished behind the two
front-runners.
   New York was his last stand.

   Health care workers with AIDS are nearly twice as
likely as other AIDS patients to have contracted the disease
through ``undetermined'' means, federal health officials said
Thursday.
   They added, however, that the occupational risk to such workers
remains small.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported that 2,586
health care workers are known to be among the more than 50,000
Americans who have contracted AIDS. Health care workers make up 5.4
percent of the known U.S. AIDS patients and also make up a similar
percentage of the population at large _ 5.7 percent, the CDC said.
   But while only 2.8 percent of the nation's other AIDS patients
are classified as having gotten the disease in an ``undetermined''
manner, nearly twice as many of the health care workers with AIDS
fall into no known risk group _ 5.3 percent, or 135 in all.
   Reasons for the higher number of ``undetermined'' cases among
health care workers are unknown, the Atlanta-based CDC said. Those
reasons could include failure to disclose homosexual behavior, drug
abuse or other risk factors, ``the occupational risk of (AIDS)
infection as a result of blood exposure, or both.''
   The disease most often strikes homosexual men and injectible
drug abusers, and also is spread less frequently through
heterosexual contact or blood transfusions.
   Failure to disclose behavior which might have put them at risk
is something researchers consider when looking at ``all AIDS
patients with undetermined risk ... both health care workers and
non-health care workers,'' said Dr. Mary Chamberland, a CDC AIDS
specialist.
   ``Or, we may be seeing some occupational transmission in the
health care setting,'' she said. ``It's difficult to establish with
certainty how transmission occurred.''
   Most U.S. health care workers who have AIDS were infected
outside their job, but ``a small number of health-care workers have
been infected ... through occupational exposures,'' the CDC noted
in its weekly report.
   More than a dozen health care workers are documented to have
become infected with the virus that causes AIDS as a result of
their work _ usually by accidentally being pricked by a
contaminated needle. One health care worker is known to have gone
on to develop the deadly disease itself after he was infected in
such a manner.
   Scientific studies have shown that the chance of being infected
after a needle-stick exposure to blood from infected patients is
less than 1 percent, the CDC said.
   ``That data has not changed at all (in continuing studies),''
Ms. Chamberland said. ``The risk is still regarded as low, and it's
most closely associated with inoculation with (tainted) blood,
either in a needle-stick or in a cut with a sharp object.''
   The number of cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome
reported in the United States is 59,491, including 33,280 cases in
which the person has died, according to statistics this week from
the CDC.

   The United States ``may have shot ourselves in
the foot'' by overreacting with this week's military attacks on
Iranian oil platforms and ships in the Persian Gulf, Rep. Les
Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in
remarks released Thursday.
   ``There is good reason to suspect that the mines that prompted
Monday's retaliation were not laid by Tehran authorities, but by
some Iranian radicals looking to start a fight,'' the Wisconsin
Democrat said.
   Aspin admitted that ``I cannot prove this. No one at this time
can prove who ordered the laying the of the mines _ or why.''
   Aspin's analysis was contained in a speech he will deliver
Friday morning to the Washington Forum, a private group. A text of
the speech was released Thursday evening.
   White House spokesman Bill Harlow, asked for comment, said, ``I
don't usually engage in debates over speeches.''
   At the Pentagon, officials said there would be no comment until
they had read Aspin's speech.
   ``We may have shot ourselves in the foot,'' said Aspin. ``Our
restrained policy in the gulf worked superbly until now. We had
shown sufficient force to convince Iran to back off, without
reacting so bloodily as to generate the `martyrs' that the
(Iranian) radicals use to inflame public passions.''
   Navy forces on Monday destroyed two Iranian oil platforms in the
southern Persian Gulf after a mine believed laid by Iran was struck
by the frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts on April 14. Ten sailors were
injured and the ship suffered hull damage.
   After the platforms were destroyed, Iranian ships and planes
attacked Navy forces and the Navy responded by sinking or damaging
six Iranian ships.
   The action won wide praise and support on Capitol Hill, both
from Republicans and Democrats. Aspin had not commented, but he
previously been a supporter of administration gulf policy.
   President Reagan, after the fighting, said, ``We've taken this
action to make certain the Iranians have no illusions about the
cost of irresponsible behavior. We aim to deter further Iranian
aggression, not provoke it.''
   But Aspin said more U.S.-Iran confrontations may lie ahead.
   The Navy has been escorting 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers and
Navy ships had previously destroyed Iranian oil platforms last Oct.
19 in retaliation for Iranian mine-laying efforts.
   Those strikes came after an Iranian ship, the Iran Ajar, was
caught by the Navy while laying mines. Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci said Monday that mines in the area where the Roberts was
damaged ``were from the same series of those found on the Iran
Ajar, leaving no doubt the mines were sown by Iran.''
   Aspin asserted that the regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
``re-evaluated its Persian Gulf policy in January'' and decided not
to confront the United States any more.
   ``There is good reason to suspect that some irate (Iranian)
radicals decided to light a fire in the Persian Gulf,'' he said.
   ``It would not take more than a handful of Revolutionary Guards
to drop some mines in the gulf sea lanes,'' he said. ``They could
expect that if an American ship hit one, the United States would
retaliate and they could return to the glorious confrontational
days of yore.''
   ``If this theory is correct, the radicals have won,'' Aspin
said. ``With this week's shoot-up in the gulf, the regime's policy
of declaring victory and then turning its back on the gulf has
failed. It cannot ignore the American presence now.''

   Israel and the United States signed an
agreement on mutual cooperation Thursday, formalizing ties
established during the Reagan administration.
   The memorandum was signed simultaneously in Washington and
Jerusalem by President Reagan and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Describing the Reagan administration as ``the friendliest Israel
has ever known,'' Shamir said the five-year agreement formalized ad
hoc arrangements developed in the past few years.
   The memorandum formalizes the two nations' consultative groups,
which meet periodically to discuss joint military and security
assistance as well as economic development issues.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering, who attended the signing
ceremony in Jerusalem, hinted at disagreements between Shamir and
the U.S. government over current American peace efforts.
   ``Peace is as vital for Israel's security as military and
economic strength and we will continue to work with all the states
in this region to achieve that objective,'' he said.
   Shamir opposes a U.S. initiative to convene an international
peace conference and speed up negotiations leading to Palestinian
self-rule, and, later, a permanent peace settlement.
   Relations between Israel and the United States drew close after
the 1967 Middle East war, when Washington became Israel's major
supplier of arms after other Western arms-producing countries
refused to sell weapons to the Jewish state.
   In 1973, the United States airlifted weapons and ammunition to a
beleaguered Israel caught off guard when Egypt and Syria lauched a
surprise attack.
   Under the Reagan administration, civilian and military aid to
Israel has grown to $3 billion and ties have grown closer.
   In 1981, the two countries signed a secret agreement on
strategic cooperation which included provisions for military trade
and joint planning.
   In 1985, an economic accord was signed lifting trade barriers
between the two countries.
   In recent years, Israel has become a port of call for ships of
the U.S. Mediterranean fleet and has provided the United States
with land for a transmitter to beam Voice of America and Radio Free
Europe broadcasts to the Soviet Union.

   Roy Romer may be governor, but he's no boss. And
when it comes to Bruce Springsteen, the state's CEO says he's just
another fan.
   ``He talks about different themes, what it is to be home, what
it is to be married. It's a guy groping,'' said Romer. ``I'm doing
the same thing. Aren't we all?''
   Romer said he had not tried to set up a meeting with Springsteen.
   ``He's got his own life he wants to live, and I respect that.
I'm one of the multitudes,'' he said.
   Springsteen performed Wednesday at McNichols Arena to a crowd of
more than 17,000 people.
   ``I'm here because Roy (Romer) is here and the boss
(Springsteen),'' said Ron Roberts of Denver. ``Romer and I are the

   Entertainer Eartha Kitt sings and speaks in
several languages _ a talent and a problem, she says.
   ``When I was growing up in Harlem,'' she said, ``a number of
people from the Caribbean were moving into the neighborhood. I
wanted to play with the children, and they all spoke Spanish.
Eventually, by talking about the games we were playing and that
kind of thing, I began to learn their language.''
   During shows this week, she sang in English, French and
Japanese. She talked in English, Spanish and French.
   Some people accuse her of putting on airs. ``The black people
think, `She thinks she's white,''' she said.
   ``My mother was black and Cherokee Indian. My father was white,
although nobody knows for sure who he was. Then my mother married a
black man who didn't want any `yellow gal' around the house. ...
She gave me away.''
   The outspoken singer was criticized for her trips to South
Africa despite that country's apartheid policies.
   ``I first went in 1974, because I was curious,'' she said. ``I
wanted to see for myself. And they're still holding that against
me.''

Realism,'' on Thursday received the 1987 Miguel de Cervantes Prize
for Literature.
   King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia presented the prize at the
university in this town outside Madrid.
   Juan Carlos praised Fuentes' ``exemplary work of creation and
thought'' and ``his insistent vocation to narrate our present
problems and delve into our promising futures.''
   In November, a jury of writers and critics named Fuentes the
1987 recipient of the award, considered the Spanish-language
equivalent of the Nobel Prize.
   In his acceptance speech, Fuentes, 59, author of ``The Death of
Artemio Cruz'' (1964) and ``Terra Nostra'' (1975), emphasized the
importance of the Spanish language.
   ``It has been converted into a universal language, spoken,
written, read, sung, thought and sounded by a growing number of
people,'' he said. ``It is the strongest link in our commmunity ..
. and the language of imagination, love and justice _ not of
empire.''
   The prize is named for the author of ``Don Quixote,'' Miguel de
Cervantes and amounts to the equivalent of $90,000.

   Former presidential spokesman Larry Speakes
said Thursday his ``Speaking Out'' is no ``kiss and tell'' book, as
Ronald Reagan has called it.
   Such a book would ``have a little more juicy-type items in it
that are a little bit more punchy,'' Speakes said Thursday on the
NBC-TV ``Today'' show.
   Speakes said the controversy over the quotes he fabricated as
the president's ``was a total surprise.''
   ``A lot of people have told me that's done all the time in
Washington, that you supply a few quotes,'' he said.
   Speakes said in the book that a comment he provided as having
been made by Reagan to Mikhail Gorbachev while they were in Geneva
at a summit meeting was never said, and another quote he gave as
Reagan's actually was said by Secretary of State George Shultz.
   ``I did it on the spur of the moment. I did it in order to serve
the president. I did it as an act of loyalty to the president,
certainly not as an act of disloyalty to the president,'' Speakes
said.
   The furor led to Speakes' resignation last week as chief
spokesman for Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York _ a job he took after
six years at the White House.
   Speakes said he did not know whether the sin was in the doing or
in the telling about it. ``It's hard for me to decide what I'm
being critized for,'' he said.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha said
Thursday he would push for black participation in Cabinet-level
policymaking and on the electoral college that selects the
president.
   Botha aides called the proposals, outlined in a speech to
Parliament, a major reform initiative, but they fell far short of
black demands for full voting rights and abolition of apartheid
legislation.
   The increasingly powerful, far-right Conservative Party, which
opposes any concessions to blacks, assailed the speech. The
Conservatives' Koos Van der Merwe urged Botha to resign and said
the president's ``colossal lack of political credibility'' had made
him an object of ridicule among his fellow Afrikaners.
   Botha's proposals appeared unlikely to ease international
pressure on South Africa for an end to apartheid, which establishes
racially segregated neighborhoods, hospitals and schools, gives the
5 million whites almost total political control and deprives the 26
million blacks of a vote in national affairs.
   But domestically, Botha's message was that his National Party
would not back off from slow-paced reform despite the
Conservatives' victories in three recent parliamentary by-elections.
   ``If the white people do not wish to follow my way, it is their
responsibility,'' Botha said. ``If they follow the way of
confrontation, it is their problem.''
   Botha's proposal to include blacks in the electoral college
would, if implemented, mark the first time that blacks had a direct
voice in the selection of South Africa's president. He gave no
details about how many seats blacks might have in the college,
which has 88 members, 50 of them from the National Party.
   Botha suggested that a Cabinet-level ``executive authority'' be
opened to people not serving in Parliament. This would clear the
way for participation in policymaking by blacks, who are excluded
from Parliament.
   Botha also reiterated his longstanding proposal for creation of
a national advisory council on which he and top Cabinet ministers
would negotiate with black leaders on drafting of a new
constitution that would bring blacks into the central government.
   ``We are not committed to the name, the form, the composition or
the functions of such a body,'' he said. ``We are committed to the
concept of a forum for deliberation.''
   He said black leaders were unhappy with the term ``national
council'' and suggested that their reluctance might be overcome by
calling the forum ``the Great Indaba.'' Indaba is a Zulu word for a
tribal assembly.
   Most prominent black leaders have rejected overtures to
participate in the council, saying the government first must free
imprisoned black nationalist leaders such as Nelson Mandela and
lift restrictions on major anti-apartheid organizations.
   Mangosuthu Buthelezi, chief minister of the KwaZulu homeland and
a leading black moderate, said Botha's electoral college proposal
amounted to ``tokenism'' because the National Party ``does not
admit to the existence of a black majority in South Africa.''
   But Buthelezi praised Botha for finding the courage to confront
the far right.
   ``Now that he has taken a first tentative step to defy the
Conservative Party ... let him be bold and be explicit about how
far he is prepared to go.''
   Helen Suzman, veteran Parliament member for the liberal
Progressive Federal Party, criticized Botha for not setting a
timetable for his proposals. She said he was evading the question
of black participation in Parliament.
   Botha became prime minister in 1978. That postition was
abolished in 1984 with the adoption of a new consititution, and he
was installed as president.
   In his speech, Botha proposed that the office of prime minister
be revived to handle day-to-day government affairs while the
president concentrates on major policy matters and ceremonial
duties.
   Botha said political progress in South Africa would be impeded
by continued pressure from the ``international brotherhood of
persecutors.''
   He stressed that white South Africans' ``values and principles
... may under no circumstances be compromised.''
   ``Should they collapse, then South Africa will collapse,'' he
said.
   He chided anti-apartheid clergymen, such as Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, for their increasingly vocal opposition to the
government and their calls for punitive sanctions.
   He said they play into the hands of the outlawed African
National Congress, the major guerrilla movement fighting the
government.
   The president said only a small fraction of South Africa's
Christians supported the anti-apartheid stance of Tutu and his
colleagues.

<HEAD>Japanese-American Expects Apology, No Reparations for Internment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Japanese-American living in Japan said Thursday
he expects to receive an apology for being interned in the United
States during World War II, but not to get reparations as approved
by the U.S. Senate.
   Barry Saiki, 68, a retired U.S. Army officer working in public
relations in Japan, said reparations were justified because
Japanese-Americans lost possessions and five years of their lives.
   ``I think we'll get the apology,'' Saiki said in a telephone
interview. But he said he thought President Reagan would veto the
bill that eventually emerges from Congress.
   The chance that Congress would overturn a presidential veto was
slim, he said, ``therefore the possiblity of getting the reparation
is rather questionable.''
   The Senate passed a bill Wednesday to give an apology and
$20,000 in tax-free payments to Japanese-Americans who were rounded
up and placed in camps after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on
Dec. 7, 1941. The House passed a similar bill in September.
   The Japanese government had no official reaction to the Senate
action because it was a domestic U.S. issue, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda told reporters.
   But Matsuda said he personally praised the Senate action because
he had been a consul general at the Japanese consulate in Los
Angeles and had worked on the issue.
   ``After many years, the justness and fairness are recovered
through democracy,'' Matsuda said. ``This is the way of American
democracy.''
   Saiki said he and his family were uprooted from their California
home in 1942 like thousands of other Japanese-Americans who fell
under suspicion after the attack on Pearl Harbor.
   He had been about to graduate from the University of California
at Berkeley, but instead ended up in a camp in Arkansas with his
mother and two younger brothers. His father was sent to a separate
camp for community leaders, he said.
   Saiki was inducted into the U.S. Army in 1944 and was
commissioned as an officer just as the war ended. His family was
able to move to Philadelphia where they worked as farm laborers,
living in the basement of an old house.
   After the war his family returned to California, again working
as farm laborers.
   ``From the day they were evacuated in 1942, in 1947, five years
later, they hadn't gotten back to prewar status,'' Saiki said.
``They had lost everything they had acquired up to 1942. ... I very
definitely feel it (reparations) is very justified.''
   He said his own military career in counterintelligence brought
him to Japan on four tours after the war, and he spent 10 years on
military duty in this country. Then, after he retired as a
lieutenant colonel in 1966, he returned here to work and has
remained ever since.
   Saiki is a member of the board of the Japanese-American
Citizens' League, which has about 150 members.
   ``Some of us are not in such pressing need for money,'' he said,
``but there are others who are. Half the people have died, and
every year the number is getting smaller. The people who deserved
the money and who need it are gradually dying.''
   Asked if he felt Japan had a role in the issue because its
attack on Pearl Harbor led to the internment, he replied: ``It's an
American problem. It's not because of Japan that it happened.''

<HEAD>INS' No. 2 Man Says Amnesty Extension Deadline is Unnecessary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOLDEN LEWIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recent surge in the number of
immigration amnesty applicants shows that the program is working
and the May 4 deadline need not be extended, the immigration
service's No. 2 official said Thursday.
   ``We have had a rush of applications toward the end of the
program, so we're sure people are aware of the deadline,'' said
Mark Everson, Immigration and Naturalization Service deputy
commissioner. ``They've had 1{ years to collect their documentation
and come forward.''
   Everson, speaking at an immigration law conference sponsored by
three law schools, said a proposal to extend the amnesty
application deadline six months will have a harder time passing the
Senate than the House, where it passed Wednesday by 12 votes. He
said the Justice Department will urge President Reagan to veto the
measure if both houses approve it.
   ``It will send a bad signal to extend it,'' Everson told about
150 INS officials, immigration lawyers, scholars and clergy
involved in helping aliens file their applications. ``People
waiting in other countries will interpret it as a lack of resolve,
and they'll eventually come here with the thought that, well,
they'll take care of me someday, too.''
   Under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, people who
have been in the country illegally since before 1982 can apply for
amnesty from deportation and obtain temporary residency. Eighteen
months later, amnesty recipients may apply for permanent residency;
eventually they can apply for citizenship.
   Everson said the imposition of employer sanctions has cut down
on the number of undocumented immigrants. So far, 70 employers of
undocumented aliens nationwide have been fined a total of $250,000,
he said.
   The two-day conference is sponsored by the Texas Tech Law
School, the University of New Mexico School of Law and Arizona
State University College of Law.
   Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., chief Senate author of the 1986
law, opposes the extention.
   ``Our numbers are right on target with the projections we used
when we passed the bill. I do not honestly see a need or
justification for extending the signup period,'' he said Wednesday.
   But during House debate, the chief sponsor of the extension,
Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli, D-Ky. said 1.2 million aliens have applied
for amnesty and 729,000 have received temporary residency cards.
   INS had hoped 2 million of the estimated 3 million total illegal
aliens in the country would apply for amnesty by the deadline.

   A fire believed to have been started by an
arsonist swept through a Leningrad department store Thursday,
causing an estimated $2.5 million in damage, the Tass news agency
reported.
   Police have detained a suspect, but gave no identification or
explanation for why the individual would have set the Frunzensky
Department Store ablaze, the official news agency said.
   The state-run TV, which provided an unusual same-day report on
the fire, showed footage of a man in jeans and a brown jacket being
led away in handcuffs.
   The fire started at 4:17 a.m. and spread to the entire fourth
floor before it was contained about two hours later, Tass said.
   There was no mention of casualties, and the building presumably
was empty in the early morning when the fire broke out.

   Israel celebrated its 40th birthday Thursday
but in the violence-ridden occupied territories it was called
Firebomb Day, proclaimed by the PLO.
   Military jets roared over Jerusalem and Israel honored veterans
of the Independence war, who fought five Arab armies in 1948.
   Soldiers were on alert in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which
Israel has occupied since the 1967 war, but Palestinians managed to
throw a firebomb at a military patrol in Bethlehem.
   Journalists were barred from much of the West Bank and Gaza, and
the 1.5 million Palestinians who live there are prohibited from
entering Israel for the rest of this week. Curfews in 23 towns and
refugee camps affected about 400,000 Arabs.
   Palestinians were on general strike in much of the occupied
lands, following the the instructions of a Palestine Liberation
Organization leaflet.
   Violence has swept the territories since Dec. 8 and at least 169
Palestinians have been killed. An Israeli soldier and civilian also
have been slain.
   New details emerged Thursday about the assassination of Khalil
Wazir, the PLO military commander also known as Abu Jihad (Father
of the Holy War).
   Israeli sources said an Israeli commando team carried out the
operation under the direct command of Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron,
military chief of staff, and took documents from Wazir's home in a
suburb of Tunis.
   They also told The Associated Press, speaking privately, that
the government approved the mission on two other recent occasions
but it was scrubbed both times for technical reasons.
   Wazir was killed early Saturday. A Tunisian report said the job
was done by Israeli commandos and Israeli sources confirm it, but
government officials have declined comment.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said, when asked about it
Thursday: ``I suggest that we stop talking about this because I
don't want to continue discussing it. I don't think anyone has
anything to say about this.''
   On its 40th Independence Day, Israel faces international
criticism both for the reported assassination of Wazir and the
tough methods it uses in the occupied territories.
   Shamir acknowledged the criticism on Israel radio, but added:
``This, too, will pass. ... I think we are coming close'' to ending
the violence in the West Bank and Gaza.
   The fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood, however, released a
12-page booklet called ``Hamas'' (Zeal) that urges an even more
intense struggle.
   ``Our style of resistance is according to what God told us: Kill
them wherever you find them,'' said the Brotherhood, which has
growing support in the occupied lands. ``This is the solution for
those who follow the Koran,'' the Moslem holy book.
   An Associated Press reporter who saw the firebomb thrown in
Bethlehem said soldiers responded with live ammunition, tear gas
and rubber bullets, breaking windows in a home and a store nearby.
   Mayor Elias Freij, a Palestinian Christian, told the AP: ``The
40th anniversary of Israel reminds us of the uprising and our
determination to achieve our legal rights and freedom.''
   At a ceremony in Jerusalem, Shamir and U.S. Ambassador Thomas
Pickering signed the most comprehensive agreement to date between
the two allies. It formalizes economic and military accords and
binds future administrations.
   ``This is the most friendly administration we have ever worked
with,'' the prime minister said. ``They are determined that the
strong friendship and cooperation will continue and even be
strengthened despite the differences that crop up from time to
time.''
   A military show highlighted the independence festivities, which
extended from sundown Wednesday to sundown Thursday.
   One hundred Israeli air force planes, ranging from U.S.-made
vintage Hercules aircraft to modern F-15 jets, flew over the center
of the country, sometimes breaking the sound barrier.
   Over a stadium near Tel Aviv, the planes flew in star formations
or formed the figure ``40.'' Three Bell-206 and two Cobra
helicopters performed aerobatic exercises.
   Four military jets flew in formation, releasing air streams dyed
blue and white, the colors of Israel's flag, as Shamir, President
Chaim Herzog, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Chief of Staff Lt.
Gen. Dan Shomron looked on.
   In the stadium, 1,500 Israeli soldiers staged mock battles and
marching exercises and parachuted from planes in target jumps.
   ``I feel joy, excitement and pride,'' said Dina Rosenbaum, 58,
of Tel Aviv, one of the 40,000 spectators at the stadium.
   ``I don't believe in nostalgia,'' she said. ``People have to go
forward.''
   The military show, one of the most elaborate in Israel's
history, was broadcast live.
   Herzog held a reception for veterans of the Indpendence war.
Israel became independent on May 14, 1948, which corresponds with
April 21 on this year's Jewish calendar, and the armies of Egypt,
Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan invaded on the same day.

<HEAD>CDC Study Says Many Cruise Illnesses Caused By Seafood Cocktail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Serious outbreaks of diarrhea
aboard cruise ships have become rare, but the most frequent known
culprit is a common delicacy: seafood cocktail, according to a
Centers for Disease Control suvey.
   Of 45 outbreaks investigated from 1975 to 1985, the most
frequently detected source was the seafood cocktails or salad,
according to a study by the CDC presented at a conference Wednesday
in Atlanta.
   Two-thirds of all cruises during those years docked in Florida
ports.
   ``It's a real popular food on cruises, and seafood is one food
which can be contaminated if it's not handled properly,'' said
David Addiss, medical epidemiologist and author of the report.
   Water was the second most common source of the outbreaks during
that 10-year-period, but Addiss noted that structural changes in
the ships' water systems have all but eliminated that problem.
   In 25 of the 45 cases, the cause could not be identified.
   Ship captains must radio to shore a day before they arrive at a
U.S. port and report the number of passengers complaining of
diarrhea. It is labeled an outbreak if more than 3 percent of the
passengers are affected.

<HEAD>White House Opposes ABC Child Care Bill, But May Endorse
Alternative</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration opposes a proposed
$2.5 billion child care bill, but may endorse other ways of helping
families with preschool children, Education Secretary William J.
Bennett said Thursday.
   Bennett said that while the administration doesn't like the Act
for Better Child Care (ABC), another bill giving a child care tax
credit to any taxpayer with preschoolers _ whether they are cared
for at home or elsewhere _ meets a series of principles he outlined
in testimony to the House Education and Labor subcommittee on human
resources.
   It is not yet clear whether the administration will propose its
own tax credit or support other federal initiatives to make day
care more affordable or available, Bennett said. Current tax law
allows a credit for children cared for outside the home.
   ``It's a matter of debate and discussion within the
administration right now,'' Bennett said.
   The ABC bill is backed by the Democratic leadership in Congress
and scores of organizations representing children, women, labor,
churches and medical personnel. It is sponsored by Rep. Dale
Kildee, D-Mich., and Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
   Three-quarters of the $2.5 billion in ABC money would help pay
the child care bills in families making up to 115 percent of a
state's median income. The rest would go for training and salaries
for child care workers, renovation of facilities and referral
programs for parents. A national advisory panel would develop
minimum federal child care standards.
   Conservatives including Phyllis Schlafly complained Thursday
that the ABC bill is too expensive and cumbersome, promotes
institutional care and discriminates against parents who stay at
home with their children. And they said the income cutoff in the
bill would let some families earning $40,000 get financial help.
   Another controversy centers on whether religious groups that
provide child care would be eligible for ABC grants. Kildee said he
is working for changes to make sure they qualify for money, but the
American Civil Liberties Union said the bill as it stands violates
the wall between church and state.
   ``This is one big new federal trough for churches,'' said Barry
Lynn, legislative counsel to the ACLU. ``Too many of them want it
and they're not willing to recognize the serious constitutional
issues here.''
   Another tax credit bill introduced by Rep. Clyde Holloway,
R-La., appears to meet the objections of both conservatives and
civil libertarians. It simply would give all families a credit of
$150 to $400 per preschool child. ``It offers more assistance and
more choice to more families with less cost to the government,''
Holloway told the subcommittee.
   Bennett said he personally favors the Holloway approach even
though some families might use the money for purposes other than
child care.
   He said the tax credit meets the administration criteria of
strengthening the family, treating stay-at-home mothers fairly, not
promoting any particular type of care, targeting funds to those
most in need and helping people without setting up a new
bureauracracy.
   Reflecting statements submitted for the record by Labor
Secretary Ann McLaughlin and assistant Health and Human Services
Secretary Sydney J. Olson, Bennett said the federal government
should not regulate day care centers, although ``I certainly see
the need for some kind of standards so the public and individual
families can have some security.''
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of
Manufacturers have endorsed the gist of a middle-ground proposal
sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Rep. Nancy Johnson,
R-Conn.
   Their Child Care Services Improvement Act would give states $250
million in grant money for day care expansion and scholarships and
$100 million to start risk pools to limit liability. Another $25
million would be available to help home providers meet state
licensing requirements.

<HEAD>With AM-Reagan Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan told what he conceded
was a ``very cynical'' joke Thursday as part of his response to a
question about the Middle East at a world affairs forum here.
   After pledging efforts to secure talks between Israel and its
Arab neighbors, Reagan said:
   ``I can't resist telling you a little joke. It's kind of cynical
_ very cynical in a matter of fact _ about the Middle East.''
   In the joke, a scorpion comes to a creek and asks a frog to
carry him across it, because scorpions can't swim.
   The frog says, ``Why, you'd sting me if I did.''
   The scorpion responds, ``That'd be silly because if I stung you
and you died, I'd drown.''
   ``Well, that made sense to the frog so he said, `get on,' and
started ferry him across and in midstream the scoprion stung him,''
the president said.
   As both were dying, the frog asked the scorpion, ``Why did you
do that _ now we're both going to die.''
   ``And the scorpion said, `This is the Middle East,''' the
president concluded.
   The joke was greeted with laughter and applause by members of
the World Affairs Council of Western Massachusetts.
   In answering a question about the Middle East, Reagan said that
``we are going to keep on trying as hard as we can'' to bring about
talks between the Arab states and Israel.''
   When asked whether the United States was willing to talk with
the Palestinians, Reagan said, ``Yes.'' He added that the United
States ``refused on principle'' to deal with Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat because he does not recognize
Israel's right to exist.
   ``What we are seeking is Palestinian leaders who will agree to
come together with the other Arab states,'' Reagan said.

   Thirty-eight Democratic lawmakers representing
western states on Thursday released a letter urging their party's
presidential candiates to make western issues a basic part of their
campaign strategy.
   ``We believe that our region could be the key to winning the
White House this year,'' the congressmen said in letters intended
for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley of Washington, House Majority
Whip Tony Coehlo of California, and Assistant Senate Majority
Leader Alan Cranston, also of California, are among those
supporting the effort.
   ``In light of current polling data, as well as Democratic
statewide victories throughout the region, 1988 could be a
breakthrough presidential election year for the Democratic party in
the West,'' the letter said.
   ``The Republicans know this too, and are already talking about a
Western running mate,'' the congressmen said.
   Earlier this week, Republican chairmen from 18 western states
urged Vice President George Bush to select a westerner as his
running mate.
   Secretary of Interior Don Hodel, a native of Oregon, and
California Gov. George Deukmejian have been mentioned as possible
Republican vice presidential nominees.
   The Democrats' letter asked the party's candidates to meet with
western lawmakers in the next few weeks to discuss a western agenda
that includes such issues as Pacific Rim trade, energy policy,
natural resources, environmental protection and regional economic
development.
   The letter said there was ``no time to lose in formulating a
western strategy'' and that upcoming primaries could ``lay the
groundwork'' for a Democratic victory in the November general
election.
   The next western primary is Oregon on May 17, though several
states will have conventions to pick delegates before that date.
The nation's largest primary, California with 314 Democratic
delegates, is June 7. New Mexico's primary also is June 7.
   House and Senate members from Washington, Oregon, California,
Idaho, Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Hawaii and New Mexico signed the
letter.

<HEAD>Federal Deficit Totaled $29.1 Billion in March</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government ran up a $29.1 billion
budget deficit in March, but the amount of red ink in the first six
months of the fiscal year was 3.5 percent less than the same period
last year, the Treasury Department said Thursday.
   The deficit last month topped a $23.9 billion shortfall in
February and a rare, $16.1 billion surplus in January, which
occurred because Social Security checks that month were mailed
early and were counted as part of December's spending.
   Analysts note that the budget imbalance is usually higher in
March than in other months because because people who owe taxes for
1987 generally wait until April to pay, while those due a refund
normally file early.
   For the first half of the 1988 fiscal year, the government has
run a deficit of $118.9 billion, 3.5 percent lower than the red ink
incurred for the same period a year ago.
   For the entire fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the Reagan
administration is projecting a deficit of $146.7 billion, down 2.4
percent from the $150.4 billion deficit in 1987.
   However, others use less optimistic projections. The
Congressional Budget Office estimates the deficit will climb to
$157 billion.
   Last year, the deficit fell sharply because of an unexpected $28
billion windfall in tax payments made by people who sold off
long-term assets before the capital gains rates were increased
under the new tax law.
   Some analysts say there could be a second, smaller windfall this
year if people end up owing more in taxes for 1987 than they would
have under the old tax law. That, however, will not be known until
the government issues its budget report for April next month.
   In March, government revenue totaled $65.0 billion, while
spending totaled $94.1 billion. For the first half of the year,
revenues total $412.0 billion while spending amounted to $530.9
billion.
   As usual, the largest spending categories in March were the
military followed by Social Security, other programs in the
Department of Health and Human Services and interest on the
national debt.
   Military spending totaled $25.8 billion last month and $142.3
billion for the fiscal year so far, up 5.6 percent from the same
period a year ago.
   Spending for Social Security totaled $18.4 billion last month
and $105.0 billion for the past six months, up 5.6 percent from the
same period in the 1987 fiscal year. Social Security is exempted
from budget limitations under the Gramm-Rudman law and is thus
generally showing faster spending increases than the other
categories.
   The other HHS programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, spent
$14.2 billion in March and $77.5 billion so far this budget year, a
5.9 percent increase over 1987.
   Interest on the $2.5 trillion national debt totaled $14.4
billion last month and $105.2 billion so far this fiscal year, an
increase of 9.6 percent over the same period last year.

<HEAD>Surgeon, Actors Support Use Of Animals In Research</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heart surgeon Michael DeBakey, along with
actors Helen Hayes and Tony Randall, spoke out on Thursday for
continued use of animals in medical research, arguing that animals
will play a major role in the search for a cure for AIDS and heart
disease.
   DeBakey, who was first to perform a successful coronary bypass
and the first to successfully use a partial artificial heart,
recalled that when he was in medical school more than 30 years ago,
``not a single cardiovascular disease could be treated
effectively.''
   ``Now, we have patients who are living reasonably normal lives
for 20 or 25 years after surgery,'' DeBakey said. ``The only means
by which we can do these things is in working in labs with
animals.''
   DeBakey and the others said they chose this week to state their
case to counter Laboratory Animal Liberation Week protests by
animal rights activists who oppose all use of animals in medical
research. Barring that, some are pushing for stricter controls on
the care and feeding of laboratory animals.
   Thomas E. Starzl, a transplant surgeon at the University of
Pittsburgh, said he, like the animal rights activists, abhors
cruelty to animals and said any incidents of poor treatment of
research animals are the exceptions rather than the rule.
   Randall began the news conference by saying he has worked with
the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation for about 20 years. Although great
strides have been made in treating the disease, a cure still has
not been found, he said.
   Both he and Hayes, who began raising funds for Jonas Salk's work
on a polio vaccine after her daughter died of polio, argued that
animals are necessary to medical research.
   ``If a cure is to be found for AIDS and heart disease, I see no
alternative,'' Hayes said.
   Janna Koch, whose 7-year-old daughter was born with a congenital
heart condition, said she ``was lucky. I didn't lose my daughter.
Through animal research, doctors were able to develop a pacemaker
for her.''
   Mrs. Koch, who is president of the Florida chapter of a group
called Incurably Ill for Animal Research, said medical research has
found cures for many diseases.
   ``We no longer have to live with diseases like polio,'' she
said. ``That's when animal research is taken for granted.''

<HEAD>Mitchell Appeal Goes To Full Supreme Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The full Supreme Court will consider a bail
request from two former state senators sentenced to prison for
their role in the Wedtech scandal.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall on Wednesday declined to act by
himself on a request by Michael and Clarence Mitchell for bail
pending their appeals.
   Toni House, a Supreme Court spokeswoman, said she did not know
if the justices would take up the motion at their regular session
Friday.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist had denied the bail request
Monday, so Clarence Mitchell had to report Tuesday to the
Lewisburg, Pa., federal prison to begin his 4{-year sentence.
   But lawyers for the brothers then submitted a new motion to
Marshall.
   Referring the question to the full court is a routine in such
cases. Having the full court decide prevents petitioners from going
from one justice to another seeking a favorable decision.
   The Mitchell brothers were convicted of fraud and obstruction of
justice for accepting $50,000 to block a congressional
investigation of Wedtech Corp., the now defunct New York City-based
defense contractor, which won multimillion-dollar contracts by
claiming it was substantially owned by minorities.
   The investigation was led by their uncle, then-Rep. Parren J.
Mitchell, D-Md., chairman of the House Small Business Committee. He
was never implicated in any wrongdoing.
   The brothers contend they have been denied bail because they are
black, while white defendants have been allowed to remain free.
They had appealed the bail issue from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   Michael B. Mitchell, also a former state senator from Baltimore,
is to begin his sentence May 19, also at Lewisburg.

   Ursula Meese, the wife of Attorney General
Edwin Meese III, testified Thursday before a federal grand jury
investigating possible conflicts between her family's personal
finances and her husband's job.
   Mrs. Meese, who was accompanied by Nathan Lewin, the family's
attorney, did not respond to a reporter's questions, but Lewin said
she is cooperating with the panel.
   ``We are confident that everything will end up favorably to Mr.
Meese when the thing is concluded,'' Lewin said after Mrs. Meese
arrived at the U.S. Courthouse for her closed-door testimony.
   Independent counsel James McKay is supervising the grand jury,
which is looking into a broad range of issues involving Meese,
including his ties to attorney E. Robert Wallach. Wallach has been
indicted in the Wedtech Corp.in New York on charges of accepting
bring to use his influence with Meese.
   Meese appeared before the grand jury on Monday.
   McKay is known to be looking into Mrs. Meese's $40,000-a-year
job with the Multiple Sclerosis Society where she serves as a
development director for Operation Job Match, a program that finds
jobs for the handicapped.
   James Bierbower, the society's attorney, said McKay has
subpoenaed all of the group's records.
   Mrs. Meese's salary is underwritten by The Bender Foundation, a
tax-exempt philanthropy run by a Washington real estate family.
Mrs. Meese began her paid work for the society in January 1986.
   The Associated Press reported last week that a partnership
headed by Howard M. Bender, the foundation's vice president, owned
a building on which the government signed a $50 million lease for a
Justice Department office building in May 1987.
   Thirteen days after signing the lease, the Bender partnership
sold the building for a $22.6 million profit.
   Meese has denied any wrongdoing and said he didn't have anything
to do with the lease.

<HEAD>U.S. Forces Preplanned Attack on Iranian Frigate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States began its military operation
in the Persian Gulf last Monday with the specific goal of sinking a
particular Iranian frigate that was known for its vicious attacks
on merchant ships, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   Ironically, that goal was abandoned at one point during the
fighting because another Iranian ship had been sunk. The frigate
that had been targeted, however, ultimately came under attack after
firing on U.S. forces, only to be spared from sinking by Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci.
   Those and other details of the most extensive military clash
ever between Iran and the United States were released Thursday by
Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman.
   Beyond discussing the original attack plans, Howard disclosed
President Reagan had been asked to make only one command decision
during the course of the actual fighting, giving an OK for U.S.
jets to bomb some small Iranian gunboats that had been spotted
attacking ships and rigs in an oil field.
   U.S. forces sank or seriously damaged two Iranian naval frigates
and four smaller gunboats and fired on two Iranian jets Monday in
fighting that erupted after the United States destroyed two Iranian
offshore oil platforms.
   Reagan ordered the destruction of the platforms in retaliation
for the mining on April 14 of the frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts.
Ten sailors were injured in that incident.
   Howard and Carlucci, in previous briefings, had disclosed the
Navy originally planned to hit three platforms instead of two. One
target was dropped, they said, when fighting erupted elsewhere in
the gulf.
   Howard acknowledged on Thursday that the United States also had
included among its original targets an Iranian warship and that was
why three Navy ships were steaming near the Strait of Hormuz when
the attacks began.
   The ship selected for sinking was the Sabalan, a frigate that
has earned the special enmity of all merchant seamen in the gulf
because it makes a point of shooting at the crew quarters on
tankers it attacks.
   Howard agreed Thursday the decision to include an Iranian ship
as a target was a first, but denied the United States was changing
its policies or immersing itself directly in the Iran-Iraq war.
   The United States, he said, had given assurances to Iran ``that
we considered their mining of international waterways to be a
hostile act and if any U.S. flag vessels were damaged by those
Iranian mines, that we would certainly respond.''
   ``Now, we decided that as part of that response, we were going
to sink an Iranian naval vessel,'' he continued.
   ``The Sabalan was a target of availability. We knew where it
was. That was the first criteria. The fact that this ship had
perpetrated any number of vicious attacks on merchant vessels in
the gulf certainly did nothing to lessen our desire to use it as a
target of availability.''
   According to Howard, the attacks on the platforms were scheduled
to occur first, and when they did, the Iranians apparently warned
the Sabalan by radio. It ran at high speed for the naval port at
Bandar Abbas, where the Iranian frigate anchored between two
tankers, making it impossible for U.S. ships to fire Harpoon
missiles at it, he continued.
   Shortly after one of the platforms was attacked, an Iranian
missile boat, the Joshan, attacked the cruiser USS Wainwright and
was in turn sunk.
   ``At that point, we were prepared to terminate the operation,''
Howard said. ``The conclusion was that we had accomplished our
goal.''
   The Iranians, however, were not ready to stop. Another of their
frigates, the Sahand, came charging out of Bandar Abbas and fired
on the U.S. ships and jets overhead, Howard said.
   It promptly was attacked and hit repeatedly and is believed to
have sunk. It was at this point the Sabalan steamed back out into
the gulf and, like the Sahand, opened fire on American ships and
aircraft.
   A Navy A-6 Intruder attack jet was ordered to use a laser-guided
bomb against the Sabalan and hit the ship perfectly, causing
extensive damage. At this point, Howard said, the pilots asked
permission to finish off the ship, and that request was relayed
back to Washington.
   Carlucci and Adm. William J. Crowe, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, discussed the matter briefly in the Pentagon war
room, where they had been monitoring the action, Howard said.
   Carlucci concluded the ship should be spared further attack in
hopes Iran would end the fighting. The order was passed and no
further fighting ensued, the spokesman said.

   Iran on Thursday buried 44 sailors killed
in battles with the U.S. Navy this week, and mourners declared that
the Persian Gulf would be ``Reagan's graveyard.''
   An informal truce appeared to have suspended a missile duel that
began Feb. 29 between Iran and Iraq and has killed hundreds of
civilians in the cities of both countries.
   Iraq got in the two last shots. Its official Iraqi News Agency
said two surface-to-surface missiles were launched at Qom, seat of
Iran's Moslem hierarchy, at 11.45 p.m. and they would be the last
if Iran did not retaliate.
   There were no reports of Iranian missiles being fired.
   Iran reported several civilians killed and others wounded at
Qom, 100 miles south of Tehran, but gave no figures. Iran and Iraq
have been at war since September 1980.
   Funeral processions were held at Bandar Abbas and Bandar
Bushehr, Iran's two major ports on the Persian Gulf.
   Hundreds of mourners were shown on Iranian television shouting
``Revenege! Revenge!'' as they buried sailors killed Monday in the
most serious engagement between Iran the Navy since President
Reagan ordered U.S. warships to the gulf to escort reflagged
Kuwaiti tankers in July.
   Young men waved banners reading: ``The Persian Gulf will be
Reagan's graveyard.''
   They shouted ``Death to America! Death to Reagan and Saddam!''
Iraq's president is Saddam Hussein.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Rear Adm.
Mohammed-Hussein Malekzadegan, Iran's navy commander, as saying the
sailors fought a ``heroic battle'' with the Americans. He claimed
U.S. forces fired on his men in the water after they abandoned
their stricken vessels.
   It said Malekzadegan spoke to journalists while inspecting the
frigate Sabalan, one of the ships damaged.
   No confirmed U.S. casualties were reported in Monday's
confrontation, but a Marine helicopter with a two-man crew is
missing. Iran claims to have shot it down.
   Prime Minister Hussein Musavi said after a Cabinet meeting
Wednesday night: ``We will not forget the blood of the Iranians
shed by the U.S. mercenaries in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. should
know we will not tolerate the presence of the filthy Americans.''
   Monday's fighting began after the U.S. Navy destroyed two
offshore Iranian oil platforms. Reagan ordered the platforms
attacked as retaliation for a mine that blew a hole in a Navy
frigate last week and wounded 10 sailors.
   The Pentagon said an Iranian patrol boat was sunk, three armed
speedboats sunk or damaged and the frigates Sabalan and Sahand
disabled.

   Tennis star Ivan Lendl on Thursday won a major
battle in his fight to play for the U.S. Olympic team this summer
when a skeptical House subcommittee voted to give the Czech native
immediate U.S. citizenship.
   The measure, which even proponents had given little chance of
passage earlier this year, was approved without opposition and sent
to the House Judiciary Committee.
   Subcommittee approval likely will lead to easy passage by the
full House, said Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., a member of the
panel and chief sponsor of the bill.
   But the legslation still would face serious obstacles in the
Senate, where Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the
Senate Judiciary immigration subcommittee, is wary of Olympic
exemptions.
   The subcommittee voted to speed up the citizenship of Lendl and
two lesser-known Olympic hopefuls by removing the five-year waiting
period permanent residents are required to go through.
   Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli, D-Ky., the panel's chairman who
regularly opposes Olympic bills, said he was ``sympathetic'' to
arguments that preventing Lendl from participating in the Olympics
would be a ``true hardship'' because an athlete's prime years are
limited.
   Mazzoli said, however, that he was concerned by the testimony of
U.S. Olympic Committee officials who said citizenship would not
automatically make Lendl eligible for the U.S. team.
   ``We're in kind of a Catch-22 in a way that we have to take
action without actual assurance that these people would compete
despite their world-class caliber,'' Mazzoli said.
   Mazzoli's consideration of the Lendl measure reflects a change
of attitude on Olympic citizenship bills.
   Last year, Mazzoli outlined a new rule of his Judiciary
subcommittee on immigration, refugees and international law that
viewed private immigration bills as an ``extraordinary remedy
available only to assist aliens with unusual problems and where
extreme hardship ... can be demonstrated.'' It noted that the panel
would be ``extremely reluctant'' to consider bills for Olympic
athletes.
   But Lendl supporters led by Morrison redoubled their efforts
this year when House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, pushed through a
special citizenship bill for a 21-year-old Canadian-born swimmer
living in Texas.
   Mazzoli said one of his concerns has been that the few athletes
who won citizenship from Congress in past years have been
unsuccessful in the international games.
   ``The one ski guy is still completing the course,'' Mazzoli said.
   But this year, for the first time, the subcommittee called in
U.S. Olympic Committee officials who vouched for the quality of
Lendl, along with Jens-Peter Burntd, an East German swimmer who
defected in 1985 and is living in Alabama, and Gagik Barseghian, an
Armenian wrestler who moved to California in 1986.
   The Olympics, which will be held Sept. 17-Oct. 2 in Seoul, will
include tennis as full sport for the first time since 1924. It was
a trial sport in 1984.
   Modified Olympic rules will allow professional tennis players
such as Lendl, the world's No. 1 ranked player, to compete.
   But Ronald T. Rowan, general counsel of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, said under International Tennis Federation rules, a
player first must represent his country in the Davis Cup before the
Olympics.
   Federation rules also say Lendl needs a special waiver to play
for the United States in the Davis Cup since he previously has
represented his native Czechoslovakia in those games. The next
Davis Cup is in July.
   ``They need the citizenship to argue on behalf of the waivers
and we create the citizenship without the knowledge that these
people will ever compete,'' Mazzoli said.
   Morrison rejected criticism that lawmakers are favoring athletes
such as Lendl, pointing to dozens of other special immigration
bills approved for non-athletes.
   ``We are put in the position of looking like we are taking care
of a few famous people, when what we're trying to do is balance one
arbitrary rule against another arbitrary rule,'' he said.
   Lendl, 28, moved to Connecticut in 1981 and received his
permanent resident status last year. Immigration law requires a
five-year waiting period before a permanent resident can become a
citizen.

   Congress on Thursday was urged to ban most
random drug testing of private employees and job applicants to
protect them against ``cheap and wildly inaccurate'' urine tests
used by a growing number of businesses.
   ``There are too many workers who are being subjected to bad
tests, improper procedures and a profound lack of legal protection
in the workplace,'' Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., told a House
hearing.
   Companies that conduct tests recklessly and without proper
guidelines can ``ruin the lives of their employees'' and hinder
legitimate efforts to prevent drug abuse, Schumer said. ``An
incorrect drug test with no chance for appeal can swiftly destroy a
career and a family.''
   Members of the House Education and Labor subcommittee on
employment opportunities generally supported a bill sponsored
chiefly by Schumer that would ban private random drug testing
except for ``probable cause'' and for workers in health or safety
occupations.
   Schumer's bill would require a follow-up test using a highly
sophisticated method if an initial urine test shows positive for
drug use. The measure also would give employees broad access to
their drug test records.
   Schumer said most urine tests are ``cheap and wildly
inaccurate,'' and that more sophisticated tests are ``accurate but
expensive.''
   Under questioning by Rep. Matthew G. Martinez, D-Calif., Schumer
said he would welcome a provision calling for automatic
rehabilitation instead of a firing for any employee who tests
positive for drug use.
   L. Nye Stevens of the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, confirmed Schumer's estimate that 49
percent of the Fortune 500 list of largest U.S. businesses now
administer drug tests to employees, and said the number is
increasing.
   A recent GAO survey indicates that a minority of businesses do
not provide follow-up tests to employees or job applicants who
initially test positive, and do not tell applicants they were not
hired because of a positive test, Stevens said.
   The GAO official also reported that 13 of the 34 states surveyed
do not regulate drug test laboratories and that some laboratories
in about one-third of the 34 states are unregulated either by
federal or state governments.
   ``It is my opinion that random drug testing is a waste of time
and money, is counterproductive and can create a false sense of
security,'' testified Dr. Arthur J. McBay, chief toxicologist for
the North Carolina state medical examiner's office.
   Washington lawyer David Soley said there are virtually no legal
safeguards against drug testing abuses for private employees except
under terms of their labor contracts.
   Soley accompanied Juanita Jones, a school bus attendant in the
District of Columbia who was fired after her random drug test
showed falsely that she had used marijuana. She testified that it
took a two-year battle in local courts to clear her name and get
her job back.

   Developer Donald Trump, who showed city
officials how to get things done by fixing a Central Park skating
rink faster than they could say ``fill this out in triplicate,''
now wants to try his hand at patching up the Williamsburg Bridge.
   Trump toured the crumbling bridge Thursday, calling repair work
done so far ``scary'' and pronouncing himself the one to get it
fixed.
   Savoring again his 1986 triumph of rebuilding the rink after the
city and its bureaucrats tried and failed for years, Trump said the
multimillion-dollar problem of the bridge stirs his imagination.
   He denied that he also may be stirred by another chance to show
up Mayor Edward I. Koch, with whom he has been trading insults for
two years.
   The 85-year-old bridge was closed last week when cracked and
corroded beams were found. The bridge, one of three spanning the
East River between Brooklyn and Manhattan, carried 240,000 daily
commuters who drove or took the subway over the bridge.
   Officials expect that temporary repairs to the span will allow
it to reopen in a matter of weeks, but the question of whether to
then begin a total overhaul for $250 million or replace the bridge
entirely for even more money is undecided.
   Officially, Trump was at the bridge for a look-see at the
invitation of Alfred DelliBovi, a former Republican state
legislator from Queens who now runs the federal Urban Mass
Transportation Administration.
   The Democratic mayor said DelliBovi was welcome to show the
bridge to whomever he wished. But Koch, commenting at a housing
rally, said he has asked Trump to put up moderately priced housing
in the city, not just luxury buildings.
   ``After he's done that, then we can talk about other things, but
not before,'' said Koch.
   DelliBovi told reporters that he had asked Trump for help
because he feared that city bureaucratic inaction would turn
restoration of the bridge into a four- or five-year job.
   But Trump said he'd had his eye on the bridge before DelliBovi
wrote to him last week.
   ``I've already been here a number of times over the last number
of days and weeks,'' said Trump. ``This is one of the things I'd be
willing to do for the administrator (DelliBovi), for the city, if
they like. I would be willing to step up and get this bridge open
quickly.''
   Commenting on the estimate of $250 million to put the bridge
right, Trump told reporters ``I would hope to be able to do it for
less.''
   ``The figure is probably realistic, depending on what has to be
done,'' he said.
   ``An easy solution is to spend a lot of money, but if you can
spend a little money and get the same result, or a better result,
that's what I'd be here for.''
   Trump said the deal could work the same way as the skating rink
construction in 1986 _ he would advance the money, get the job done
and be reimbursed for costs. That repair project took five months
and about $3 million, after the city had spent $12 million over
seven years and still didn't have a working rink.
   ``I wouldn't want to make a profit,'' he said. ``This is
something I want to do.''
   During his tour of the bridge, Trump pointed to holes and ragged
edges on newly painted I-beams and said: ``Now that's the most
scary thing, when they fix it, but it's not fixed.
   ``You're looking at beams where the rust is painted over, but
there's nothing under there; it's all rotted out.''
   City Transportation Commissioner Ross Sandler, who accompanied
Trump and DelliBovi, reponded: ``In some cases, the repairs will
come after the painting. No one's suggesting paint take the place
of lost steel.''

   Officials frustrated with their inability to stop
drug dealing say they will prosecute the owners of 200 ``crack''
houses and hope eventually to demolish the buildings.
   Seven drug dens have been destroyed in suspicious fires this
year, the latest on Wednesday, fire department spokeswoman Cristy
Hickman said.
   ``People are taking the law into their own hands,'' said Pablo
Canton, Miami's assistant director of community development. ``Why
are they doing it? Because they don't see any solution in their own
neighborhoods.''
   Cases will be presented Friday to the Dade state attorney's
office involving two crack-house owners, who, Canton said, were the
easiest to prosecute. Under state law, the owner of an unsafe house
can be fined $500 a day until the problems is solved and serve a
60-day jail term.
   Vice Mayor Rosario Kennedy said Wednesday she also is trying to
pressure the county Unsafe Structures Board to be more diligent.
The county allows Miami to put 15 buildings at a time on the
demolition list _ while the city has hundreds it wants torn down.
   The city also said it will ask the county commission to allow it
to set up its own Unsafe Structures Board with the power to raze
buildings. The city says it eventually could recover the cost
through liens on the property.

<HEAD>Pentagon Reports Two Contacts With Intruders in Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American troops guarding U.S. facilities in
Panama detected two groups of intruders his week and in one case
drew gunfire, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said the
latest incidents occurred on Tuesday and Wednesday nights near
bases on the Pacific Ocean end of the Panama Canal.
   They followed two other incidents last week, in which one Marine
was killed accidentally and a group of Marines fired on what they
described as a group of 40 to 50 armed intruders.
   The incident Tuesday, the more serious of the two this week,
occurred around midnight near an ammunition storage depot next to
the U.S. Naval Station-Panama, Howard said. An Army sentry
stationed there spotted three men who had crossed ``inside the
perimeter of the site,'' he said.
   ``The guard's report indicated that the intruders wore berets
and carried small arms and bags. An intruder fired shots at the
(U.S.) guard. The guard returned the fire, remained at the sentry
post and requested assistance.
   ``The intruder then fired again. A Marine quick-reaction force
(of 12 men) was sent to reinforce and assist in the search of the
area. A security sweep of the area was completed during darkness
with negative results, but the investigation continues. There were
no casualties during the incident,'' Howard added.
   The second incident occurred around 8 p.m. Wednesday when three
U.S. sentries manning an observation post to the west of Howard Air
Force Base detected roughly 30 intruders approaching the base, the
spokesman said.
   ``The soldiers fired on the intruders, and they also fired two
Claymore mines as a diversion,'' he continued.
   Howard said those intruders then retreated, apparently without
firing any shots at the sentries.
   The spokesman disclosed the latest incidents in acknowledging
the Pentagon had been unable to establish conclusively that armed
intruders fired on Marines during one of last week's incidents.
   Military investigators spent several days combing the jungle
area where about 100 Marines fired at what they believed to be 40
to 50 armed intruders near a fuel tank facility.
   ``It's true that there were no expended cartridge casings
found,'' Howard said.
   Investigators did turn up, however, ``a couple of bottles of
insect repellent not used by U.S. forces; a used first-aid bandage;
a black-colored kerchief, and also the sweep there revealed several
well-established trails around the perimeter marked with slash
marks,'' he said.
   ``There is other evidence as well. There were also some sensors
set off in the area. But is it conclusive? I don't believe it is.
No final evaluation has been done on this at this point.''
   The Marines have been ridiculed by Panamanian military strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega, who accused them of firing at ``swaying
palm trees.''
   About 1,900 additional U.S. troops have been ordered to Panama
in the last several weeks to provide increased protection for
American bases and facilities near the Panama Canal.

<HEAD>King's Widow Calls For Massive Turnout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Using the Lincoln Memorial as a backdrop, the
widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on Thursday called for a
massive turnout for an Aug. 27 rally commemorating the 25th
anniversary of the March on Washington.
   It was at the memorial on that occasion, with a quarter of a
million people in attendance, that King delivered his ``I have a
dream'' speech.
   ``One score and five years ago upon this historic spot, a group
of leaders from a growing movement for jobs, freedom, peace for
Negro-Americans assembled,'' Coretta Scott King said. ``A lot has
happened since then and a lot has not happened since then.''
   She said the march this year is ``to help us rekindle the
passion of people for jobs, peace and freedom.''
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, said the anniversary march will call on
``drum majors for justice and friends of goodwill to regroup'' for
what he said was King's ``unfinished and unfulfilled dream that can
no longer be deferred.''
   The Aug. 27, 1963 march brought demonstrators from across the
nation to the Lincoln Memorial. King and nine other civil rights
leaders met with President John F. Kennedy in the White House.

<HEAD>Canada To Build $1 Billion Crane System on U.S. Space Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada announced Thursday it will join the
United States in building a space station, a decision that was
hailed by the head of America's space agency as the beginning of a
new era in U.S.-Canadian cooperation.
   The $1.18 billion Canadian contribution _ about $1 billion in
U.S. dollars _ will be a Mobile Servicing System, in effect a
moving crane to unload visiting space shuttles or to move
satellites around.
   Canada thus joins the European Space Agency, which will spend $2
billion for a module to conduct micro-gravity experiments, as a
participant in the U.S. space station. The permanently manned
facility is expected to be in operation in Earth orbit in the
mid-1990s. Japan, the last partner, is said to be nearing agreement.
   Robert de Cotret, Canada's minister of science and technology,
called the space station ``the most significant international space
project of this century and the largest international technology
development project ever undertaken.''
   In response, James C. Fletcher, administrator of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, called Canada's decision
``the beginning of a new era of cooperation between our two
countries.''
   Fletcher said the Mobile Servicing System was a vital and
essential component for assembling and maintaining the station.
   ``Together we will build a permanently manned outpost in space
and together we will explore the enormous potential of space _
sharing the benfits for decades to come,'' Fletcher said.
   Canada designed and built the robot arm that is used on space
shuttles.
   NASA has said it will spend $16 billion to put up the space
station.

<TEXT>
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat will not visit
Syria soon despite speculation the burial of his murdered deputy in
Damascus would signal a rapprochement with President Hafez Assad, a
PLO official said Thursday.
   George Habash, leader of the Marxist Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, said Arafat abandoned plans to attend
Khalil Wazir's funeral on Wednesday because there were no
guarantees of an official welcome or an audience with Assad.
   Wazir, 52, better known by his nom de guerre of Abu Jihad, was
gunned down by a commando unit that burst into his home in the
Tunisian capital of Tunis on Saturday.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization and the Tunisians blamed
Israel for the slaying of Wazir, the PLO's coordinator for unrest
in Israeli-occupied territories. Miltary sources in Israel also
confirmed Israeli involvement.
   At the United Nations on Thursday, Israel boycotted a Security
Council meeting at which nations attacked it for Wazir's
assassination.
   Tunisian Foriegn Minister Mahmoud Mestiri asked the council to
condemn Israel for ``terrorist aggression'' against his nation in
Wazir's slaying.
   Wazir was buried Wednesday in the Yarmouk refugee camp outside
Damascus as hundreds of thousands mourned.
   His slaying and the key role he played in the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
spawned new efforts to end the 5-year-old rift between the PLO and
Syria.
   Long considered a pragmatic moderate within the PLO, Wazir was
widely respected even by Arafat's opponents in dissident
Palestinian factions.
   Arafat was expelled from Damascus in 1983 at the peak of a
Syrian-sponsored mutiny in PLO ranks, but the Syrian government had
said all PLO officials, including Arafat, were welcome to take part
in Wazir's funeral.
   Speaking in an interview at his headquarters in Damascus, Habash
said Arafat should have come for the funeral.
   ``If I were in his shoes, I wouldn't have missed this
opportunity,'' he said.
   The PLO dissidents have been based in Damascus, but the key
groups such as Habash's group and the Moscow-backed Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine reconciled with Arafat in
Algiers last year.
   Assad, Moscow's main Arab ally, has been under pressure from the
Soviets to reconcile with Arafat to forge a united Arab front for
an international Middle East peace conference it seeks to convene.
   Intensive contacts have been made in Damascus between Syrian
officials and PLO leaders since they arrived Tuesday for Wazir's
funeral.
   ``The Palestinian leadership agrees that the body of our great
struggler, Abu Jihad, should become a bridge for resuming relations
between the PLO and Syria,'' said Nayef Hawatmeh, leader of the
Democratic Front.
   PLO sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Syria
intends to reconcile with Arafat but that Syria's relations with
the United States appeared to be a stumbling block.
   The Syrians have been slowly mending fences with the United
States in recent months. Washington has been seeking Assad's
support for its latest Middle East peace initiative but refuses to
deal directly with the PLO until it recognizes Israel.
   Israeli sources said an Israeli commando team carried out the
killing of Wazir under the direct command of Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron,
military chief of staff, and took documents from Wazir's home in a
suburb of Tunis.
   They also told The Associated Press, speaking privately, that
the government approved the mission on two other recent occasions
but it was scrubbed both times for technical reasons.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Thursday said when asked about
the assassination: ``I suggest that we stop talking about this
because I don't want to continue discussing it. I don't think
anyone has anything to say about this.''

<TEXT>
   The Navy is deploying 13 ships to the Persian
Gulf region over the next week in a long-planned and routine series
of rotations, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   Defense Department spokesman Dan Howard said he was announcing
the ship movements to head off speculation the United States had
already decided to increase the size of its Middle East force.
   Howard said earlier this week the administration was reviewing
its gulf policies following clashes Monday with Iranian forces. But
he stressed Thursday that review was continuing and the new
deployments involved ships earmarked for ``a changing of the
guard.''
   ``It's been scheduled for some time. It's not a reinforcement,''
the spokesman said.
   The Navy tries to limit to six months the maximum deployment for
any warship.
   Howard said five ships would leave East Coast ports on April 28.
He identified them as the destroyer John Hancock and the frigates
Fahrion, Halyburton, Nicholas and Robert G. Bradley.
   On April 25, the aircraft carrier Forrestal and seven escorts
will leave East Coast ports for a routine deployment first to the
Mediterranean Sea and then on to the Indian Ocean and the northern
Arabian Sea outside the gulf, Howard said.
   The seven escorts are the destroyers Spruance, Dahlgren and
Semmes; the frigates Pharris and Elmer Montgomery; the oiler
Milwaukee and the ammunition ship Suribachi.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Plastic Gun Bill Aimed at Helping Airport Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House Judiciary subcommittee on Thursday
unanimously approved legislation that would impose a five-year ban
on the maufacture, sale or possession of plastic firearms which can
evade detection machines.
   The plastic gun bill, aimed at stopping terrorists at airports,
went to the full Judiciary Committee. The panel could consider the
legislation next week.
   The legislation defines a plastic gun as one containing less
than 3.7 ounces of metal. Rep. William J. Hughes, chairman of the
subcommittee on crime, said the metallic content was set at an
amount that can trigger alarms on today's magnetometers.
   He said the standard was agreed upon by the departments of
justice, treasury, transportation and the law enforcement community.
   The bill also would require firearm components to generate X-ray
images which accurately depict the shape of the components.
   ``There is no question but that such firearms, once perfected,
will become the weapons of choice for terrorists and criminals, and
pose an unnaceptable threat to the national security and public
safety,'' Hughes said.
   The bill would make it a federal offense to knowingly
manufacture, import, sell, transfer or possess a plastic firearm,
with maximum punishment of five years imprisonment. There also
could be fines of up to $250,000 for an individual and $1 million
for an organization.
   Rival legislation would require that guns be detectable, but
calls for no minimum metal content. That legislation is supported
by the National Rifle Association.

   Tongue-twisting names that used to sound
strange to voters don't spell defeat at the ballot box any longer,
politicians say.
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., interviewed Wednesday night on PBS'

Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis in November.
   Heflin said Dukakis' name, if the Massachusetts governor wins
the Democratic nomination for president, would not hurt him in

   Other candidates with ethnic names have fared well in the state,
Heflin said, mentioning John Katopodis, who has been elected to the
Jefferson County Commission in Birmingham.
   Katopodis said he was sorry he missed the television show.
   ``I was out cutting weeds, which is what every good ethnic

   Names don't carry the same weight as they did 30 or more years

   City officials reacted cautiously Thursday
to news that Maryland's capital city has been chosen to host a
presidential debate.
   Spokesman Thomas Roskelly told The (Annapolis) Capital that the
city received word from the Commission on Presidential Debates
confirming that Annapolis had been selected as a site.
   Roskelly said if the city accepts, the debate would be Sept. 14.
Three other cities, Pittsburgh, Winston-Salem, N.C., and Omaha,
Neb., have already agreed to host debates.
   However, Roskelly said, whether Annapolis can accept the offer
is still undetermined. ``We're excited, but we have to be
practical,'' he said.
   He said the city would have to promise the commission it could
meet 13 pages of conditions, including financial guarantees and
assurances that an adequate number of hotel rooms will be available.
   To meet the conditions, Roskelly said, the city will need
assistance from the state, Anne Arundel County and private

<HEAD>Cuomo Advises Koch: Keep Mum on Primary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo scolded a crowd for booing
Mayor Edward I. Koch on Thursday, then, in an aside, gave his
former political rival some advice: ``Don't say anything about the
primary.''
   The incident came at a housing rally on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan two days after the state's Democratic presidential
primary, in which Koch raised the ire of many voters with his
outspoken attacks on Jesse Jackson.
   The result of Koch's remarks, Cuomo told reporters later, was to
give New York ``a black eye.'' He added that New York was
erroneously perceived as ``some hellhole of contention and
divisiveness.''
   Koch endorsed Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., who finished a
poor third behind Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Jackson.
Cuomo remained neutral.
   Cuomo was wrapping up his comments about extending the
Mitchell-Lama housing law when Koch arrived at the rally site.
``I'm with you, all the people up here are with you, the mayor of
the city of New York is with you,'' Cuomo said.
   At that, the crowd of 200 let loose as many boos as cheers, and
Cuomo briskly moved back to the microphone.
   ``Hey, wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait,'' the governor called
over the crowd. ``Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You want to do me a
favor please?'' More boos erupted. ``You want to do me a favor?
Hold it!''
   Cuomo asked if the group wanted the housing program extended. It
cheered. He called Koch ``one of the strongest voices we have on
this Mitchell-Lama bill.'' He asked the crowd, ``How do you feel
about him in that issue?''
   The group cheered, albeit grudgingly. Koch stepped up and began,
``Governor _ how do you do this?''
   Cuomo, moving past Koch, muttered laughingly to the mayor:
``Don't say anything about the primary.''
   Koch chuckled. ``He's amazing,'' the mayor said. ``And he's a
good friend to have, when you need a friend.''
   Cuomo, asked as he left if he thought New York got ``a black
eye'' from the primary turmoil, said: ``Yes, I think we did get a
black eye. I think what happened is that Mayor Koch was perceived
as being critical of Jesse Jackson, and he attacked Jesse Jackson.
I wish he didn't.''
   Cuomo added: ``I think that there was no question that the
public impression was that this is some hellhole of contention and
divisiveness and everybody pushed everybody else. It is not true.''

   Seven gunmen who held 42 people
prisoner following a failed bank robbery in northern Mexico ended
their siege today and escaped with two Red Cross workers as
hostages 24 hours after the ordeal began.
   ``Thanks to you, the hostages are safe,'' a policeman shouted to
the hundreds of people who had gathered outside the bank as the
siege ended. The crowd had pressed officials to resolve the crisis
peacefully.
   Sinaloa state Gov. Francisco Labastida Ochoa said the gunmen
left in two armored cars, taking with them two Red Cross rescue
workers as hostages.
   Five people were killed and 15 wounded in the tense standoff in
this Gulf of California port.
   The 42 hostages still in the bank were taken to a local hospital
by Red Cross ambulances.
   Labastida Ochoa said in a television broadcast that the escape
cars had enough gasoline for the gunmen to leave the city.
   He said in the interview on the Televisa network's afternoon
news program that the agreement allows police to look for the
gunmen later.
   ``We're not deceiving anyone,'' Labastida Ochoa said. ``We
simply reached an agreement in which we could safeguard lives.''
   The governor also said there were no injuries in a shooting
incident during the morning, in which the gunmen grabbed weapons
from a pickup truck outside the bank. Earlier news reports were
that one gunman was wounded by police fire.
   One of the gunmen, speaking by telephone with a radio station in
Culiacan, the state capital, said this morning they had reached an
agreement with Red Cross workers for the gunmen to leave the
building safely.
   The gunman, who gave his name only as Alfredo, said two of them
went out heading toward an ambulance but went instead toward a
pickup truck, where they grabbed some guns.
   The police started firing and the gunmen rushed back inside,
Alfredo said. The private major television network Televisa said
one of them was wounded.
   ``We have more weapons now,'' Alfredo said. ``Here there are
many innocent people. ... We are all going to die. ... They did not
comply. They started to shoot.
   ``Let them give us the helicopter ... or we are going to blow up
all of this. ... We don't want innocent people to die, but if we
are going to die, innocent people are going to as well.''
   Earlier, in a telephone call to Mexico's major morning TV news
program on Televisa, a gunman said officials broke their agreement
by shooting. He also demanded a helicopter.
   Labastida Ochoa got on the line and offered to let the gunmen
meet with a committee of Red Cross officials, journalists, a Roman
Catholic priest and state police who would guarantee safety and due
process of law.
   Hundreds of police surrounded the Banamex bank in this city of
120,000 on the Gulf of California about 500 miles south of Tucson,
Ariz.
   Jesus Acosta, a spokesman for the local Red Cross, said one of
its rescue workers was among those killed in a gunfight Wednesday
between police and the gunmen. He said the other four victims were
a female bank teller and three customers.
   Other accounts said the dead included a bank official and a
policeman. Earlier reports said there were six gunmen.
   The gunmen demanded to be allowed to travel to a nearby airport
and leave on a plane, said Ignacio Lara, spokesman for the Sinaloa
state governor.
   The standoff began at 12:45 p.m. Wednesday (3:45 p.m. EDT).
Witnesses said the gunmen burst into the bank and took hostages
after an alarm alerted police to the robbery.
   Another of the gunmen, in an interview broadcast live on
Televisa earlier this morning, said all the hostages were being
treated well.
   Asked where they could go if given safe passage, he replied: ``I
wouldn't be able to tell you where we could go.
   ``We can't turn ourselves in,'' he said. ``They want to kill
us.''
   The gunmen made telephone calls to Ochoa and Televisa demanding
to be allowed to leave the site. ``We don't have anything to do
with politics,'' one was quoted as saying.
   Lara said one of two police officers inside conducting business,
Roberto Soto Cruz, tried to prevent the robbery and was shot. He
said the other officer apparently was disarmed by the robbers.
   The gunmen then attempted to leave the surrounded bank, using
Soto and at least one customer as a shield, said Ramiro Guerrero,
news editor at the Noroeste newspaper in the state capital of
Culiacan, who was on the scene.
   The customer, Marco Antonio Estrada, was killed and Soto
received more wounds when the escape attempt led to a gunbattle
between police and the robbers in which ``nine or 10'' hostages
were wounded, Lara said.
   Soto died at a hospital after the gunmen allowed Red Cross
officials to escort him from the building, Guerrero said.
   Lara identified the other two people killed as Manuel Andoval
Rendon, a bank official who died of a gunshot wound to the chest,
and cashier Rosi Maria Padilla, 22, who was reported shot in the
face.
   Acosta did not identify the dead Red Cross worker.

<HEAD>Dukakis Signs Universal Health Care Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said ``today we make
history'' Thursday as he signed into law Massachusetts'
first-in-the-nation proposal to provide health insurance to all
residents by 1992.
   ``What we do here today can and must be done all over the United
States,'' the Democratic presidential front-runner told an
estimated 2,000 supporters crowded onto the Statehouse steps for
the signing ceremony.
   ``Today marks the day when working families, the unemployed, the
disabled, students and children with special needs don't go sick
because they can't afford to stay well. Those days in the
commonwealth are over,'' he said as the crowd applauded.
   ``From now on, when the sick land at the doorstep of our health
care system, the first question of them will be: `Where does it
hurt?' Not, `How will you pay?'''
   Only Hawaii, which has an exemption to federal law allowing it
to require employer health coverage, has anything comparable to the
Massachusetts law.
   However, the Massachusetts legislation, which Statehouse aides
say has generated inquiries from more than 20 states, goes beyond
Hawaii's approach by offering health security both to working and
non-working residents.
   In his speech, Dukakis didn't specifically mention whether he
would seek similar federal legislation if he became president, but
he did say: ``Today we make history. But there is more history to
be made.''
   ``As an American, I don't want my country to stand alone with
South Africa as the only two industrialized nations that do not
provide basic health security for their citizens.''
   The bill was the outcome of a nine-month legislative struggle
and comes two years after Massachusetts voters endorsed a
non-binding referendum by a 2-to-1 margin urging Congress to
``enact a national health care program ... universal in coverage.''
   The narrowly passed the legislature last week. ``The doubters
said a lot of things,'' Dukakis said. ``And they were wrong.''
   But doubters remain. Dr. David U. Himmelstein of Harvard Medical
School and spokesman for Physicians for a National Health Program
called the health care bill a first step but said it was ``a
Band-Aid approach when major surgery is needed.''
   And House Minority Leader Steven Pierce, a Republican, described
the bill as ``short-term gain and long-term pain. Mike Dukakis has
managed to pick up some short-term political gain at the expense of
long-term fiscal pain for the commonwealth.''
   On Wednesday, Dukakis estimated that the law's cost to taxpayers
would be $645.2 million through fiscal 1992, minus about $22.5
million in projected cost-cutting in Medicaid. Other estimates put
the cost to the state government in the next four years as high as
$1.2 billion.
   The thrust of the law is to provide coverage to about 600,000
Massachusetts residents under age 65 currently without health
insurance, roughly one of every 10 people in the commonwealth.
   This would be done in stages and through a variety of
approaches, from extending Medicaid benefits for disabled adults
and children to state-brokered, pooled insurance for small
businesses and individuals.
   By 1992, all employers with more than five full-time employees
must offer health insurance coverage or pay an unemployment
surcharge to help the state provide this coverage to the uninsured.

<HEAD>Adams Seeks Triggering Of War Powers Act In Persian Gulf Fighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., seeking to force a
Senate debate on the issue of ``war and peace'' in the Persian
Gulf, said Thursday he will introduce legislation to authorize the
continued presence of U.S. military forces in the gulf and set
rules for their use.
   Adams said he will also seek congressional action to trigger the
War Powers Act, which requires the removal of U.S. forces from
hostile areas within 60 days unless their continued presence is
specifically approved by Congress.
   ``In the last year we have deployed dozens of American ships in
the gulf,'' Adams said. ``We have spent tens of millions of
dollars. We have asked Americans to sacrifice their lives.
   ``But Congress has never authorized the deployment, never
appropriated any money, never clearly stated its support for the
policy that is being followed.''
   Adams said a number of individual senators have offered the
administration specific suggestions on changes or modifications in
U.S. Persian Gulf policy and some are being considered seriously.
   But he said that is not enough.
   ``The Senate as an institution has to give some guidance to the
administration,'' Adams said. ``... Congress has a right and a
responsibility to debate the policy being followed by the
administration as well as the right to consider alternatives.
   ``Only by engaging in a full and frank debate, only by working
with our colleagues and having the administration work with us, can
we refine our approach to the problem and strengthen our national
commitment to solve it,'' he said.
   The War Powers Act is a post-Vietnam attempt to apply a
congressional brake to unilateral presidential decisions to expose
U.S. forces to possible hostilities. It has been resisted by the
Reagan administration as an encroachment on the president's
authority as the nation's military commander in chief.
   Adams said he realizes an attempt to invoke it will be
challenged but said the act should be implemented because it
remains ``the law of the land.''
   ``I am not trying to force the withdrawal of American forces
from the Persian Gulf,'' Adams said. ``We have a right to be there
and a mission to perform there.''
   Adams said he is only seeking to protect the constitutional
right of the Congress to be involved in decisions to deploy U.S.
forces into areas of hostility.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. gave up his 1988 White
House bid Thursday, offering the strong suggestion that he harbors
hopes of a future campaign and moving to protect the delegates he
has won so far.
   ``It hurts to have come so far and have fallen short,'' Gore
told a Senate office room crowded with supporters. ``But there will
be other days for me and for the causes that matter to us.''
   The Tennessee senator ended the race deeply in debt after waging
a long-shot campaign that challenged the traditional dominance of
Iowa and New Hampshire. It succeeded in the South, where he won
favor as a moderate, but fell flat elsewhere.
   Gore said he would technically remain a candidate to permit his
delegates to attend the Democratic National Convention.
   In suspending his campaign, he delivered some of the most
eloquent lines of his campaign, praising each of his opponents,
excoriating Republican George Bush, and pledging support for the
eventual nominee.
   ``I want no part of a stop Jackson or a stop Dukakis movement,''
Gore said. ``The only man I want to stop is George Bush.
   ``I will not be the Democratic nominee for president in 1988,''
Gore said. ``The nominee is going to be Michael Dukakis or Jesse
Jackson. I'm going to do everything I can to help them do what I
set out to do, and that is to put a Democrat in the White House.''
   Gore exited with a joke after a failed campaign that he said
lasted 10 months and a million miles.
   ``I was doing great until I turned 40,'' he said.
   Gore amassed 423 Democratic National Convention delegates during
his campaign, according to The Associated Press count. His decision
to suspend his campaign rather than quit the race means the two
remaining active candidates cannot pick up delegates he has already
won, but who have not yet been chosen.
   Under party rules, Jackson would have gained 34 of Gore's
delegates immediately, while Dukakis would have gotten 29. Illinois
Sen. Paul Simon's decision to suspend his campaign denied Jackson
another 47 delegates he would have inherited in this manner.
   Gore said he spoke with both Dukakis and Jackson and that both
were ``comfortable'' with his decision to hold onto the delegates.
He said the move would protect Democratic leaders who backed him in
states where delegates had not yet been chosen, naming Georgia as
an example.
   He said he planned no endorsement and repeated his oft-stated
contention that he has ``no interest'' in the vice presidential
nomination, though he left that door open.
   ``I'm not trying in any way to broker a convention that is not
going to be brokered anyway,'' he said.
   Gore's withdrawal was assured by his dismal third place showing
in New York, a 10 percent finish that capped six weeks of
frustration for Gore since his six-state victories on Super Tuesday
in the South. New York had become his last chance to get back into
contention.
   Gore is saddled with a debt of more than $1.5 million, run up in
borrowing for his campaign in Super Tuesday states and after that
in an effort to break through outside the South. His debt is the
largest of the 1988 presidential candidates who have departed the
race, although as a senator he is in a position to raise money to
retire the debt.
   He spent the night before his announcement in Texas, raising
money to repay the debt.
   Facing little support in Iowa and an appeal not in sync with
that state's left-of-center Democratic activists, Gore challenged
the assumption that candidates must do well in Iowa's caucuses. He
bypassed the state and blasted its process as a distortion, and
concentrated on the South.
   But Gore's campaign was marked by internal disorganization and
division, and a tendency to postpone decisions. Gore often made the
decisions himself from the road.
   One result was that Gore spent nearly the maximum amount
allowable in New Hampshire _ over $400,000 _ but did it late and
without an accompanying commitment of time and campaign staff to
campaign full force. The result was he was neither fully in nor
fully out there, and finished fifth in a seven-way race.
   He broke through with wins in six states in the South. But then
he went through the succession of Northern states, beginning with
Illinois and Michigan, largely an unknown figure and unable to make
any progress.

<HEAD>Ted Danson Announces Formation Of Anti-Pollution Coalition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Ted Danson, the bartender in the
television series ``Cheers,'' came to Capitol Hill on Thursday to
announce formation of a new environmental coalition he said is
aimed at stopping ocean pollution.
   Danson told a news conference that as president of American
Oceans Campaign, ``I am going to dedicate my resources and my
ability as an actor to focus attention on the plight of our
oceans.''
   He said the organization, based in Santa Monica, Calif., would
be pushing for enactment of legislation to set a national policy
for protection of the oceans, with emphasis on:
   _Reducing and then ending the dumping of toxics and sewage into
coastal waters.
   _Establishing national ocean parks to protect environmentally
sensitive and economically important shorelines.
   _Deferring offshore oil and gas development until there is a
national energy policy that emphasizes conservation and alternative
energy sources.
   The group's multipurpose goals were questioned by Carl Schmid, a
spokesman for National Ocean Industries, a trade group representing
companies involved in offshore oil and gas activities.
   ``I think it's important the American people realize this is a
facade to stop offshore oil development,'' said Schmid. He said
that some of American Oceans Campaign's directors, including
Danson's wife, Casey, are active in groups fighting drilling off
the California coast.
   ``They are using the other people, other groups and congressmen
to stop offshore oil,'' Schmid said. ``I would question how much
effort they're going to devote to sewage sludge, toxics and
plastics pollution.''
   Danson was not available to respond to Schmid's statement,
issued several hours after the news conference. Calls to American
Oceans Campaign offices in Santa Monica and Takoma Park, Md., were
answered by recording devices.
   Danson said that his interest in ocean ecology was stirred 18
months ago when he took his two daughters to a Santa Monica beach
and a saw a sign saying ``no swimming, water polluted.''
   ``We have always taken for granted that we can dump anything we
want into the oceans _ all of our wastes, all of our toxics _ and
assumed that it would always be absorbed,'' he said.
   ``That is no longer true,'' Danson said. ``Dead fish are washing
up on the beaches of the East Coast and beaches are being closed on
the West Coast.''
   Joining Danson at the news conference were Sens. Lowell Weicker,
R-Conn., Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and Bob Graham, D-Fla., and Reps.
Leon Panetta, D-Calif., Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., Bill Lowery,
R-Calif., Jim Saxton, R-N.J., and Claudine Schneider, R-R.I.
   Among other entertainers listed as supporters of the
organization are Jeff Bridges, Danny De Vito, Ed Asner, Sally
Field, James Garner, Leonard Nimoy, Kirstie Alley and Ally Sheedy.

<NOTE>Eds: All dollar amounts are U.S.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Canada will be a full partner in the $14 billion
space station project intended to put a manned platform in space by
the late 1990s, Industry Minister Robert de Cotret announced
Thursday.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative government had
delayed a decision on the project for three months after the
estimated cost to Canada over the next 17 years escalated from $648
million (U.S.) to $972 million.
   De Cotret said 90 percent of the money will be spent in Canada,
producing $4 billion in spinoffs beneficial to science and industry.
   ``We've got a place in space,'' he told a news conference. He
termed the project ``an investment in ourselves, our ingenuity and
our brain power.''
   About half the extra funds required will come from a $1 billion
science and technology fund announced by Mulroney in January. It
was originally intended solely for university programs.
   Canada's contribution will be a roving space robot to act as the
hands and arms of the station. The computerized robot would have
sight, touch and reasoning powers and would unload cargo, repair
satellites and do other tasks.
   In return, Canadian astronauts would have access to the station
for about three months a year for experiments.
   The largest international civilian space venture in history will
consist of three laboratories built separately in the United
States, Western Europe and Japan, and a giant, metallic living
module made by the Americans.
   Canada is the final partner to join the consortium.
   The government has yet to decide between Montreal and Ottawa as
the headquarters for the Canadian space agency that will oversee
the project. Most of the country's aerospace industry is located
near Montreal.

<TEXT>
   The normal pleasantries of a congressional
hearing were disrupted Thursday by a charged exchange between a
congressman and a Cabinet secretary over their family backgrounds.
   Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich., opened a hearing on his major child
care bill by describing his own traditional upbringing. He said his
father worked at a Buick plant and his mother stayed home to take
care of her several children.
   Suggesting to Education Secretary William Bennett that their
backgrounds were similar, he commented, ``We must recognize that
very often there is no father in the family. ... We have to
recognize that changing family structure whether we like it or
not.''
   Several minutes later, when he got his turn to talk, Bennett
bluntly and unexpectedly took issue with Kildee's assumption that
they came from similar families.
   ``I did not grow up in Ozzie and Harriet's home or in a Father
Knows Best home. It might have been nice to,'' Bennett said,
creating a sudden hush in the packed hearing room.
   The education secretary said he came from a typical inner-city
broken family. ``My father left home when I was quite young,'' he
said. He and his brother were raised by his mother, Bennett said,
with the aid of informal child care arrangements.
   ``She held two jobs, my mother, and put in whatever time she
could'' with her children, Bennett said. ``She did this without
much benefit from the state or federal goverment, although she
could have used some help.''
   Moments later, Kildee started to describe the need for child
care in Flint, Mich., which he said has a 20 percent unemployment
rate. ``I have to walk through the real world,'' he said. ``I'm
invited to country clubs, but I don't go there often...''
   ``I do not belong to a country club, any country club,'' Bennett
broke in defensively. ``And Brooklyn (where he grew up) is every
bit as much the real world as Flint.''
   ``Let's not be confrontational. We're talking about children,''
Kildee replied, his voice rising in surprise.
   Bennett persisted. ``Some people believe all Republicans were
born rich...''
   ``I know Tom Tauke so I know that's not true,'' Kildee
interjected quickly, referring to the young Iowa congressman
sitting next to him. The room filled with laughter and the tension
broke.
   But Rep. Bill Armey, R-Texas, had the last word. He said he was
one of eight children of parents who both worked inside and outside
the home. In view of where he, Kildee and Bennett have ended up,
Armey said, the evidence is clear: ``No matter how you raise a
child, he can still go wrong.''

<HEAD>Judge: Jury To Decide Conspiracy Claim In Cancer-Liability Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evidence in a closely watched cigarette
liability case is sufficient for a jury to consider whether three
cigarette manufacturers conspired to cover up the dangers of
smoking, and the trial should continue, a judge said Thursday.
   ``The evidence presented ... permits the jury to find a tobacco
industry conspiracy, vast in its scope, devious in its purpose and
devastating in its results,'' said U.S. District Judge H. Lee
Sarokin.
   At the same time, Sarokin dismissed a claim that the three
companies sued in the liability case _ Liggett Group Inc., Philip
Morris Inc. and Lorillard Inc. _ caused Rose Cipollone's lung
cancer by not marketing a safer cigarette.
   The judge's comments came in a 33-page opinion requested by the
cigarette makers, who asked for dismissal of the case and an end to
the trial that began Feb. 1.
   The companies are being sued by Mrs. Cipollone's husband,
Antonio Cipollone of Lakehurst, whose wife died at age 58 in 1984
after smoking for 40 years. Attorneys for Cipollone completed their
case two weeks ago, alleging that Mrs. Cipollone was a victim of a
campaign by the cigarette makers to undermine warnings about the
dangers of smoking.
   In the opinion that was quite pointed at times, Sarokin said the
jury should be allowed to consider the conspiracy and punitive
claims in the case.
   Sarokin said evidence indicated the companies conspired to
conceal and misrepresent information on the dangers of smoking and
to ``refute, undermine and neutralize information coming from the
scientific and medical community.''
   He said the evidence also indicated the companies tried to
``confuse and mislead the consuming public in an effort to
encourage existing smokers to continue and new persons to commence
smoking.''
   ``The jury may reasonably conclude that defendants were members
of and engaged in that conspiracy with full knowledge and disregard
for the illness and death it would cause, and that Mrs. Cipollone
was merely one of its victims,'' the judge said.
   As for punitive damages, Sarokin said: ``If the jury accepts the
plaintiff's version of the facts as to the conduct of the
defendants, it is difficult to envision a more compelling case for
an award of punitive damages.''
   Cipollone's attorneys said they were pleased with the opinion.
   ``The judge says we have a case for the jury,'' attorney Cynthia
A. Walters said.
   ``If a case should be won, this is it,'' she said, adding that
her side introduced as evidence secret internal cigarette company
documents never before made public. They included memorandums that
spoke of a public relations ``war'' against health-related charges
involving cigarettes.
   Chuck Wall, a spokesman for Philip Morris and Lorillard, took
exception to the tone of Sarokin's opinion.
   ``I do think there were flourishes there from the judge's pen
that went beyond the plaintiff's evidence,'' he said.
   Wall also said he believed the heart of Cipollone's case was
gutted by Sarokin's opinion. ``The conspiracy claim is very tenous
at best,'' he said.
   Sarokin dismissed a claim that the companies were liable for
Mrs. Cipollone's death on the basis they knew how to design a safer
cigarette but failed to. The judge said Cipollone's attorneys could
not prove Mrs. Cipollone would have smoked the safer cigaratte had
it been marketed.
   Ms. Walters said the dismissal of that claim, which the defense
contended was the heart of the case, was not a critical blow.
   ``We thought it was an important theme, not so much for this
case but for the broader implications in future cases,'' she said.
   Sarokin also dismissed a claim that the companies failed to do
enough research on the dangers of smoking. While there was ample
evidence that the research was inadequate, the judge said,
Cipollone's attorneys did not prove that this directly harmed Mrs.
Cipollone.
   Another claim, that the companies failed to warn smokers of the
dangers of cigarettes, was also dismissed against Philip Morris and
Lorillard, but the judge said the jury will be able to consider
that allegation in the case of Liggett.
   Sarokin said Mrs. Cipollone began smoking cigarettes made by
Philip Morris and Lorillard after 1966, when the federal government
began requiring warnings on cigarette packs.
   However, she smoked cigarettes made by Liggett prior to 1966 and
there is evidence ``from which the jury could infer that, prior to
1966, ordinary consumers were not adequately informed of the health
risks of smoking,'' he said.
   James Kearney, an attorney for Liggett, said the company was
``confident we will prevail on the basis of evidence that comes out
during our presentation.''

   President Reagan will travel to Bethesda Naval
Hospital on Friday for a ``routine dental checkup,'' while his wife
Nancy has her first X-ray examination following breast cancer
surgery, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater disclosed Thursday.
   ``The president and Mrs. Reagan, en route to Camp David, will
stop briefly at the Naval Hospital at Bethesda for routine
radiological procedures,'' the spokesman said in a statement.
   Reagan ``will undergo a routine series of dental X-rays in the
dental clinic, while Mrs. Reagan will have her first post-operative
mammogram,'' the spokesman said.
   Fitzwater said the tests ``represent routine checkups, and are
not associated with any current physical findings or problems.''
   Mrs. Reagan had her left breast removed on Oct. 17, 1987, after
doctors discovered a quarter-inch cancerous lesion.
   Elaine Crispen, the first lady's press secretary, said the first
couple expected to be at the medical center in suburban Washington
for about an hour.
   ``It's Mrs. Reagan's six-month checkup, and the president
planned to use the time to get his dental X-rays taken, rather than
usually doing it at the White House,'' the spokeswoman said.
   Mrs. Crispen said the couple wanted to have the results of Mrs.
Reagan's exam before they left ``so they could send her off for a
comfortable, worry-free weekend.''
   The spokeswoman said White House physician Dr. John Hutton
planned to be present for Mrs. Reagan's exam. The mammogram is to
be conducted by a radiologist, Dr. Claudia Galbo, Mrs. Crispen said.
   Fitzwater said he expected to have some type of report on the
exams by late Friday afternoon.
   He added that the president will undergo ``no other
examination.''
   The spokesman said Reagan usually has a cleaning and checkup
every three months at the White House, but that the president
planned to have a ``panoramic'' X-ray done this time in order to
get a full-view picture of his mouth.
   Fitzwater explained that the White House has X-ray machines that
take pictures of part of the mouth, but does not have the larger
machine that pans the entire mouth area.
   The spokesman identified Reagan's dentist as Navy Cmdr. Dr.
James Judkins. He said the president has not had any complaint
about his teeth.
   The last time Reagan visited the hospital was in January, when
he underwent his annual checkup for colon cancer.
   It is the first time Reagan has gone to Bethesda for dental work.
   Reagan, who traveled to Springfield, Mass., on Thursday to
deliver a speech on U.S.-Soviet relations, appeared in good spirits
upon his return to the White House in the late afternoon. He
smiled, waved, and gave journalists a ``thumbs-up'' signal, but
refused to answer questions.
   Reagan went to Bethesda Naval Hospital Jan. 15 for a four-hour
examination to check against the recurrence of colon cancer.
   He has had regular checkups every January and June since he
underwent successful colon cancer surgery in July 1985.
   The January test showed no renewal of cancer and no growths. He
was proclaimed by Hutton at the time to be ``in excellent health.''
   Except for the last checkup in January, doctors have discovered
and removed small, fleshy growths known as polyps from Reaan's
colon. In each instance, the growths turned out to be benign.
   Reagan turned 77 in February and is the oldest man to be
president.

<HEAD>Missing Baby Found Two Counties Away By Godfather</HEAD>

   Before Douglas Gerwitz was 24 hours old,
he had been taken from his mother, found 170 miles away by a police
officer who happened to be his godfather, and sent back to his
parents.
   Albert Cecil Duane Lewis, 25, and Judy K. Lewis, 32, were being
held by authorities in Holbrook, where the infant was found in the
back seat of a car, said Prescott Police Capt. Bob Reed.
   `It's a heck of a coincidence,'' said officer Douglas Newton
after he found his godson and namesake.
   The 4-hour-old son of Lisa and John Gerwitz, of the Payson area,
had been taken from Prescott's Yavapai Regional Medical Center
about 7 p.m. Wednesday. Police said a a woman masquerading as a
hospital laboratory worker told the mother she was taking the baby
for some tests.
   Hospital officials realized the child had disappeared about 45
minutes later when Mrs. Gerwitz asked a nurse when her son was
going to be returned to her, Prescott Police Sgt. Bill Clayton said.
   Just after midnight, Judy Lewis entered the Holbrook Police
Department and asked for traveler's aid, such as gas money and a
place to stay, Sgt. Stewart Bracke said.
   Newton was helping Ms. Lewis, who said she was alone, when he
discovered she actually was traveling with a man and a baby, Bracke
said.
   Police found the three matched the description of a man and
woman seen in the hospital, and the missing baby. They were able to
confirm the baby's identity three hours later.
   After little Douglas was examined at Holbrook Community Hospital
and pronounced in good health, authorities drove him back to
Prescott.
   He was reunited Thursday afternoon with his parents at the
hospital. Mrs. Gerwitz appeared briefly with the baby in her arms
to thank law enforcement officers, hospital personnel and others
who assisted in getting her son back.
   Newton knew the kidnapped baby's parents from high school,
Bracke said.
   Hospital administrator Michael Vitek said Lewis apparently
pulled off her masquerade as a laboratory technician by dressing in
a lab coat she probably picked up in the hospital's obstetrics area.
   ``Lab coats are in the nurses' lounge, and on hall trees in the
OB department. Hospital policy is that when our OB nurses go to a
different part of the hospital, they put on the lab coats to
minimize infections,'' Vitek said.
   Vitek also said hospital officials will review the ``entire
package of hospital policies relating to security of infants.''
   ``We expect to have some feedback from the investigators from
the Prescott police,'' he added.

<HEAD>Rebels Threaten Development Projects; Farmers Demand Land Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIGUEL C. SUAREZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>

   Communist rebels threatened Thursday
to attack any development projects funded by the U.S. and Canadian
governments on the impoverished island of Negros.
   In another development Thursday, about 10,000 militant farmers
marched through Manila to demand land reform.
   The National Democratic Front branch on Negros said U.S.- and
Canadian-financed projects there were being used as ``tools to
oppose the revolutionary movement.''
   The Front is the communist rebel umbrella organization.
   It said the projects were among targets singled out by the
rebels as they prepare to step up attacks on Negros, 300 miles
southeast of Manila. Other targets include military units,
multinational corporations and individuals considered ``enemies of
the people.''
   The threat came in a statement signed by rebel Roman Catholic
priest Frank Fernandez and sent to news media in Bacolod, Negros.
   Fernandez heads the Negros chapter of the Front.
   Hours later, suspected communist rebels shot and killed a
policeman and a militiaman in an ambush near a cemetery in Bacolod,
police said.
   The statement did not specify any single project and did not say
if the attacks will include assassinations of U.S. and Canadian aid
personnel.
   U.S. and Canadian aid officials were not in their Manila offices
Thursday and could not be reached for comment. It could not be
ascertained if any American or Canadian personnel were stationed on
Negros island.
   The U.S. Embassy said earlier it had stepped up security and
told its staff to take extra precautions after communist rebels
killed three Americans and a Filipino in attacks last October
outside U.S. Clark Air Base north of Manila.
   Another Front statement circulated during daylong marches and a
rally in Manila by the leftist Philippine Peasant Movement urged
farmers to join the 19-year-old insurgency. It said the rebels had
redistributed land to farmers in areas they control and that
``revolutionary land reform and armed struggle are the only ways to
free the farmers.''
   Several legislators, including President Corazon Aquino's
brother-in-law, Sen. Agapito Aquino, and priests and nuns joined
the protesters. They urged the farmers at a rally to pressure
Congress to pass a meaningful land reform law.
   Thursday's marches and rally were peaceful, and the protesters
dispersed at sundown without incident. But Jaime Tadeo, leader of
the protest, denounced the military for blocking thousands of
farmers as they approached Manila in motorcades early Thursday from
seven outlying provinces.
   The Most Rev. Teodoro Bacani, Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop of
Manila, said the church backed the farmers' demand for immediate
land reform and said there was a need to ``wake up ...
(legislators') consciences if they are asleep.''
   Last July, Mrs. Aquino decreed a nationwide land redistribution
program but left most details up to Congress.
   The Senate and the House approved separate land reform bills
last month but still have to reconcile differences in the two
drafts, which peasant groups say favor landlords.

<HEAD>Reagan Concerned That Senate May Not Rafify Treaty Before Summit</HEAD>
<HEAD>DESK: SUBS grafs 5-7 bgng ``Senate Majority Leader ... '' to
update with fresh Byrd material.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Thursday he is
``very concerned'' that the Senate may not ratify the pending
U.S.-Soviet arms control treaty before he goes to Moscow for summit
talks with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In a question-and-answer session after a speech to the World
Affairs Council of Western Massachusetts, Reagan was asked by a law
student what the effect on the talks would be if the Senate had not
yet ratified the treaty.
   ``I think it would be very upsetting and would put a strain on
the summit if the Senate has not ratified the treaty by the time we
go there,'' the president said.
   ``We hope and pray that they will, but their scheduling of it
has been such that I am very concerned we may have to go without
having had it ratified,'' he said.
   Replying to Reagan, Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., told a news conference he will not schedule the treaty for
debate until a dispute is resolved on whether or not the pact bans
futuristic weapons such as those using laser beams or particle rays.
   He said this can be done only by attaching a reservation to the
treaty's resolution of ratification or by obtaining an
authoritative and binding commitment from the Soviets.
   ``The date of the summit does not drive me at all and it should
not drive the Senate,'' Byrd said. ``This treaty is in a vacuum by
itself and the Senate has to make a judgment ... Remember, we're
dealing with the Soviet Union. I want to be sure all the I's are
dotted and all the T's are crossed before the Senate acts on
ratification of this treaty.''
   ``I want this treaty,'' Byrd said. ``I have no doubt it will be
approved at some point. But I want to be absolutely certain our
interpretation (that the treaty bans medium-range futuristic
weapons) is authoritative and documented by the Soviets as being
their interpretation and their commitment likewise.''
   ``It isn't my fault that those who negotiated this treaty didn't
bring this issue into the procedings,'' Byrd said.
   He said he has no objection of opening debate on the pact on May
9, if the issue of futuristic weapons is resolved by then. But he
said that once debate begins many amendments will be offered to the
treaty by opponents.
   ``I don't know how much time it will take,'' Byrd said.
   The pending treaty, covering intermediate and shorter-range
missiles, was signed by Reagan and Gorbachev at their summit
meeting in Washington in December.
   When the two leaders meet again in Moscow May 29 to June 2, one
of the issues confronting them will be a treaty still being
negotiated that would cover longer-range intercontinental nuclear
missiles.
   Of this treaty, Reagan said, ``There is a great question as to
whether it could be ready for signature at the summit.''
   ``We don't want a fast treaty,'' he said. ``We want a good one.''
   On another issue, the president was asked about a trade bill
being considered on Capitol Hill. Reagan said that if it reaches
his desk in its present form, he will veto it.
   He also said he would immediately ask Congress to enact a new
bill that did not contain provisions to which the administration
objects, including a requirement for companies to give workers
notice of plant closings.
   In response to a question about the trade deficit, Reagan said
that in the latest government report the deficit ``went up a little
bit. They didn't say a little bit _ they made it sound horrendous,
something about around $13 billion plus in trade deficit. What they
didn't add was that exports had been at the highest level seen so
far.''
   In his speech to the group, which was billed as a scene-setter
for the upcoming summit, Reagan proclaimed a ``period of realistic
engagement'' between the United States and the Soviet Union.
   ``Even while freedom is on the march, Soviet-American relations
have taken a dramatic turn, into a period of realistic
engagement,'' Reagan said.
   ``Two of the most basic rights that we have called on the
Soviets to comply with,'' the president said, ``are the right to
emigrate and the right to travel. How can we help but doubt a
government that mistrusts its own people and holds them against
their will?
   ``And what better way would there be to improve understanding
between the United States and the Soviet Union than to permit free
and direct contact between our two peoples? In the new spirit of
openness, why doesn't the Soviet government issue passports to its
citizens? I think this would dramatically improve U.S.-Soviet
relations.''
   On Afghanistan, Reagan told his audience, ``Now the Soviets say
they have had enough.''
   ``But let me say here that the next few momths will be no time
for complacency, no time to sit back and congratulate ourselves.
The Soviets have rarely before _ and not at all in more than three
decades _ left a country, once occupied. They have often promised
to leave, but rarely in their history, and then only under pressure
from the West, have they actually done it.''
   Turning to the treaty on intercontinental missiles now being
negotiated, which both sides have said they have some hopes of
signing in Moscow, Reagan said that the treaty on medium and
shorter-range missiles signed in December ``is reality and now the
Senate should give it ratification.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters on the
flight from Washington aboard Air Force One that ``we think
everyone wants to ratify the treaty before the summit. The impetus
is for that to happen. It would be a shame if it did not happen. We
think we can overcome any obstacles. But there are still hurdles to
be crossed.''

   Mick Jagger took the witness stand
Thursday to defend his hit song ``Just Another Night'' against a
reggae musician's charge of plagiarism, saying the first time he
heard the other man's song was after the lawsuit was filed.
   Jagger that he he started in music 25 years ago in England, he
had composed 200 to 300 songs, both alone and with Keith Richards,
guitarist in the Rolling Stones.
   Reggae musician Patrick Alley, 36, of New York City, is suing
Jagger, claiming the famed Rolling Stone took the chorus from
Alley's 1979 song, also called ``Just Another Night,'' and used it
in Jagger's 1985 solo hit.
   Jagger's testimony came on the fourth day of the trial. Jagger
told the jury that the first time he heard Alley's song was in his
attorney's office in 1986 after the lawsuit was filed.
   His attorney, Peter Parcher, asked Jagger what he thought of the
song and he said, ``I don't want to cast aspersion on Mr. Alley. A
lot of people in this courtroom don't like my music. Personally, I
don't really like that song.''
   Jagger testified that he often recorded songs by other artists
and had no hesitation in giving them credit.
   For more than an hour, the jury and a courtroom filled with fans
and reporters heard how Jagger developed his song, beginning with a
November 1983 tape, which Jagger described as ``just me, with
acoustic guitar, starting off with this tune.''
   Several tapes were played, detailing how Jagger, other musicians
and arranger Carlos Alomar developed the song into the form that
would ultimately appear on his 1985 solo album, ``She's the Boss.''
   Jagger rocked back and forth to the beat as the tapes played,
sometimes seeming embarrassed as, on the tape, he grunted or made
other sounds as substitutes for lyrics.
   He said that on none of the tapes did drummer Sly Dunbar appear.
Dunbar, who appeared on the final cut of Jagger's song, allegedly
was the drummer on Alley's song in 1979. Dunbar has testified that
he couldn't remember.
   Alley's lawyers say Jagger's song netted as much as $6 million.
   The courtroom had been set up with amplifying equipment in
anticipation that Jagger would perform, but that did not occur
Thursday.
   Another of Jagger's attorneys, Gerald Margolis, said, ``He'll
play if he has to, if the only way to prove it and show it, he
will.''
   Jagger was scheduled to resume testifying Friday afternoon.
   Earlier Thursday, a music expert testified on his behalf that
the two songs were very different and that the title, ``Just
Another Night,'' was fairly common.
   Daniel Ricigliano, chairman of the theory department at the
Manhattan School of Music, said that while the rhythmical settings
of the two choruses were similar because of the similarity of
lyrics and ideas, the choruses were ``totally different'' in every
musical way.
   He testified that a review of song titles at the Performing Arts
Library in Lincoln Center revealed more than a dozen songs since
1928 with the title ``Just Another Night.''
   Earlier in the week, Alley's expert witness, Juilliard teacher
Andrew William Thomas, said his analysis of the songs found the
choruses to be ``virtually identical.''
   Outside court Wednesday, Jagger had said: ``My credibility is on
the line because of this. ... I think it's pretty obvious to
everyone that the songs are entirely different aside from a few
words and the title.''
   He called the trial a ``ridiculous waste of time.''
   Alley's chorus lyrics are, ``Can I spend another, just another
night, just another night, just another night with you.''
   Jagger's lines are, ``Give me just another night, just another
night with you. Give me just another kiss, just before the dawn
breaks through.''
   The jury is to determine only whether there was an infringement
of Alley's copyright. If the jury finds in Alley's favor, the
parties can arrange a settlement on damages or can have damages
determined at a second trial.

   A new federal government with
fewer departments and a drastically reduced staff was appointed
Thursday in a move to tighten the belt on Czechoslovakia's
bureaucracy.
   The official CTK news agency said the new 20-member government
was appointed by President Gustav Husak. The changes, however, were
proposed by the Communist Party leadership at a recent meeting.
   The previous 26-member government resigned Wednesday, one day
after Parliament rubber-stamped a Communist Party Central Committee
decision to merge five ministries into two.
   In Czechoslovakia, changes in government are decided by the
party leadership.
   Lubomir Strougal remains premier in the new government, which
has six deputy premiers instead of ten. There had been some
speculation that Strougal might be replaced.
   The new government now has ten ministries, three less than
previously.
   ``Times were never easy for governments,'' Strougal said. ``But
these are the most difficult times.
   ``We know what we want ... but at the same time we must count on
many unexpected phenomena which we shall have to solve both in
economic and social development as well as in internal and foreign
policy, where more activity and initiative is needed on our part,''
Strougal said.
   Czechoslovakia has adopted the rhetoric of reform over the past
year, but has proceeded cautiously in making changes like those
carried out in the Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Husak, who was replaced as party leader in December by Milos
Jakes, said each minister is to ``look critically at the area he is
responsible for.''
   The governments of the Czech and Slovak republics also were
reorganized, reducing their ministries by four and three,
respectively.
   The shuffle apparently is designed to streamline government
bureaucracy and spur the country's economy.
   The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo said the staffs of the
federal and republican governments are to be cut by about 30
percent. Rude Pravo said ``thousands of people'' would be fired
through the reorganization of state administration.
   However, it said no one would be left without a job.
   ``The process must be aimed primarily at ensuring the growth of
quality and performance of the managing aparatus and at a good and
effective use of the released workers primarily in places and
professions where manpower has been lacking so far,'' CTK quoted
Rude Pravo as saying.
   Former deputy Premier Ladislav Gerle now heads a newly created
ministry of metallurgy, engineering and technology, which merges
three separate ministries. The ministries of communication and
transport were combined under Vladimir Blazek, the former minister
of transport.
   The only new member of the government, according to sources in
Prague, is Marian Calfa, minister without portfolio, who is in
charge of government coordination.

<HEAD>5,000 Workers Said to Protest Wages in Southeast Poland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 5,000 factory workers in southeast
Poland rallied Thursday, chanting ``Solidarity, Solidarity!'' and
demanding pay raises to offset recent price increases, an
opposition spokeswoman said.
   Activist Ewa Kubema said the rally took place in front of
management headquarters of the sprawling Stalowa Wola heavy
machinery plant, 95 miles southeast of Warsaw. It employs 18,000
people.
   Wieslaw Wojtas, chairman of the factory chapter of the outlawed
Solidarity trade union movement, read a speech listing workers'
demands, including across-the-board pay raises of $50 a month, she
said.
   The average wage in Poland is about $90 a month.
   She said another demand was an end to harassment of union
activists. The union threatened a strike at an undefined date if
its demands are not met, she said.
   The union had called for the demonstration in leaflets
distributed over the past two weeks, said Ms. Kubema.
   It began at 2 p.m., the end of the first shift, with a whistle
from the factory's locomotive repair shop, she said. At that time,
there were about 10,000 workers at the plant.
   After Wojtas' speech, she said, workers chanted ``Solidarity,
Solidarity!'' and sang the national anthem, holding up their hands
in V-for-victory signs.
   She said there were no arrests at the rally, but lawyer
Wladyslaw Liwak, secretary of the Solidarity committee at the
factory, was detained at his home.
   Solidarity was banned after the 1981 martial law crackdown in
Poland, but local units continued to function clandestinely at many
factories.
   In a shift of union strategy last year, new units were organized
publicly, and dozens of them have unsuccessfully gone to court
seeking legal registration under a 1982 labor law.
   Government price increases of 40 percent took effect this year,
part of the government's program of economic reform. At the same
time, workers in socialized enterprises received an automatic $15
monthly pay raise.
   Authorities expressed concern that factory managers, under
worker pressure, will be too generous about awarding additional
wage increases. They warned managers they could lose their jobs
unless wage increases are merited by higher productivity.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Cuts Star Wars Spending, Approves MX, Midgetman
Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate subcommittee voted Thursday to cut
spending for President Reagan's ``Star Wars'' program, but also
generally granted administration requests for the Midgetman and MX
missiles, congressional sources said.
   The votes by the Armed Services subcommittee on strategic
weapons and nuclear deterrence came behind closed doors as the
panel began working on a bill authorizing the Pentagon budget for
the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   The panel voted to approve $4.6 billion for the Strategic
Defense Initiative, as Reagan's Star Wars plan is formally known,
according to the sources, who spoke on condition they not be
identified.
   Reagan had sought $4.8 billion for Star Wars, which is
authorized for $3.9 billion in the current fiscal year.
   The panel also voted to generally approve Reagan's request of
about $200 million for research into the single-warhead Midgetman
and $800 million for research into basing the 10-warhead MX weapon
aboard trains on western military reservations, the sources said.
   The subcommittee decisions, if they are eventually affirmed by
the entire Armed Services Committee and then the full Senate, will
set up another fight with the House.
   Although both chambers are controlled by Democrats, Reagan's
defense budget requests have generally fared better in the more
conservative Senate and Thursday's votes continued that trend.
   The defense bills which separately pass each chamber will
eventually go to a House-Senate conference committee to iron out
differences.
   The House will next week begin considering a defense budget bill
which authorizes $4 billion for Star Wars, $600 million less than
the Senate subcommittee voted Thursday.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, says he expects the full House to approve the $4 billion
figure after a fight by liberals who want to reduce it more and
conservatives who want to raise it.
   The House measure also raises spending on the Midgetman from
Reagan's request of $200 to about $500 million, while reducing the
MX request from $800 million to $500 million.
   The Midgetman is the single-warhead missile which is backed by
congressional Democrats but opposed by the Pentagon. Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci said he wanted to eliminate the Midgetman
program, but agreed to include $200 million at the request of
Congress to keep the program alive until Reagan's successor can
make a decision about the fate of the program.

   Gerald F. Seib, White House correspondent for
The Wall Street Journal, won two awards Thursday night for his
stories on the Reagan administration's approach to the December
1987 summit between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Seib was presented the Merriman Smith Award and the Aldo Beckman
Award at the annual dinner of the White House Correspondents
Association.
   The Smith Award, named for the late UPI White House
correspondent, carries a $500 prize, as does the Beckman Award,
named after the late Chicago Tribune White House correspondent.
   Second place in the Smith competition went to Lawrence M.
O'Rourke, of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, for his Nov. 7, 1987
story about the events that led to the withdrawal of federal judge
Douglas Ginsburg as a Supreme Court nominee.
   Jonathan Fuerbringer of The New York Times was named the winner
of the Barnet Nover Memorial Award for his day-to-day coverage of
Congress last year.
   David Rogers of The Wall Street Journal won second place for his
coverage of the Iran-Contra story. Nancy Schwerzler of the
Baltimore Sun received honorable mention for her daily coverage of
Congress.
   Barnet Nover was bureau chief of The Denver Post's Washington
bureau from 1947 to 1971. He was an expert on foreign affairs.
   George Anthan of The Des Moines Register was named the winner of
the 44th annual Raymond Clapper Memorial Award for his 1987 series
of investigative articles on widespread contamination of poultry
during processing.
   Jim Stewart of Cox Newspapers won second place for his
investigative series on a crash aboard the aircraft carrier Nimitz
that caused the deaths of seven U.S. servicemen.
   Keith C. Epstein and Mary Beth Lane of the Cleveland Plain
Dealer received honorable mention for their series on a cover-up by
the Air Force of radioactive contamination at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base near Dayton, Ohio.
   Raymond Clapper, a Washington correspondent and columnist for
Scripps Howard Newspapers, was killed in an airplane crash while
covering the invasion of the Marshall Islands in the closing days
of Pacific action during World War II.
   The winners of both the Clapper and Nover awards received
$1,500. The second place prize was $500.

   Italian authorities issued an arrest
warrant Thursday for the leader of a Japanese terrorist group
linked to the car bombing that killed an American servicewoman and
four Italians outside a USO club.
   Meanwhile, investigators said a man arrested with explosives in
New Jersey spent time in Italy in the weeks prior to the April 14
bombing.
   The arrest warrant accuses Fusako Shigenobu, a 42-year-old
Japanese woman, of massacre, attack on the security of the state
and the transport and detention of explosive materials.
   Japanese officials say Shigenobu is the leader of the Japanese
Red Army, a terrorist group with ties to pro-Iranian terror groups
in Lebanon.
   Naples investigators say she acted as an accomplice in the April
14 attack, when a car filled with explosives blew up outside the
USO club in downtown Naples.
   The investigators allege that another Japanese Red Army
terrorist, Junzo Okudaira, was the man who parked the car in front
of the club. A warrant for his arrest was issued the day after the
attack.
   The chief investigator, Romano Argenio, told reporters Thursday
that several witnesses had spotted Okudaira and Shigenobu in Naples
in the days before the bombing.
   Argenio said three other men were believed involved in the
attack.
   Police in Milan said Thursday that Yu Kikumara, a Japanese man
whose car was found with explosives when he was stopped on a New
Jersey turnpike last week, spent a few days in a Milan hotel in
late February.
   FBI experts traveled to Naples trying to determine whether he
was linked to the terrorists who bombed the USO club.
   The blast killed four Italians and Angela S. Santos, a U.S. Navy
radioman 3rd class from Ocala, Fla.

   Gunmen who holed up in a bank after a
foiled robbery in which five people died let their 42 captives go
Thursday and were allowed to flee with three Red Cross workers as
hostages.
   Police said the gunmen released the hostages 15 minutes later,
when they abandoned an armored car in which they left the bank for
a stolen pickup truck and station wagon.
   Hostage Rosario Angulo, who drove the armored car, said only
five gunmen fled, one of whom had an arm wound.
   ``I think the other two mixed in among the crowd at the moment
of leaving the bank,'' said Rosario, 20. Most police officers had
withdrawn from around the bank just before the seven men left,
apparently as part of an agreement ending the 24-hour standoff.
   Angulo said the robbers had ``goats horns (sawed-off machine
guns), ammunition and dynamite sticks.''
   When the armored car had roared away, a policemen shouted to
hundreds of people outside the branch of the National Bank of
Mexico: ``Thanks to you, the hostages are safe!''
   Spectators had urged officials to end the crisis peacefully and
some had shouted ``Freedom, freedom!'' in support of the gunmen.
   Gov. Francisco Labastida Ochoa told the Televisa network's
afternoon news program the agreement allowed police to pursue the
gunmen.
   ``We're not deceiving anyone,'' the governor said. ``We simply
reached an agreement in which we could safeguard lives.'' The 42
hostages were taken to a hospital in Red Cross ambulances.
   Soldiers were seen checking vehicles on highways leading from
the city.
   Ignacio Lara, a spokesman for the governor, said the gunmen
demanded earlier that they be allowed to leave by air. Police said
the robbers were in their late teens or early 20s and had no
political motives.
   Labastida Ochoa said there were no injuries in a shooting
incident Thursday morning when the gunmen grabbed weapons from a
pickup truck outside the bank. News reports had said one gunman was
wounded by police gunfire.
   The standoff in Los Mochis, a city of 120,000 on the Gulf of
California, began at 12:45 p.m. Wednesday when the gunmen took
hostages after an alarm alerted police to the attempted robbery.
   Bank robberies and other crime has increased in Mexico since
1982, when an economic crisis caused by plummeting oil prices began
to erode purchasing power and drive up unemployment.
   Sinaloa is known as a crime center, particularly involving the
illegal drug trade.
   Red Cross spokesmen said five people were killed and at least 15
wounded during the attempted robbery and ensuing standoff. They
said the gunmen freed two men and two women Thursday morning.
   Hundreds of police had surrounded the bank.
   ``We are all going to die,'' one gunmen said by telephone to a
radio station in Culiacan, capital of Sinaloa state.
   ``Let them give us the helicopter ... or we are going to blow up
all of this. ... We don't want innocent people to die, but if we
are going to die innocent people are going to as well,'' said the
man, who identified himself only as Alfredo.
   Gov. Labastida Ochoa had offered in an interview with Televisa
to let the gunmen meet with a committee of Red Cross officials,
journalists, a Roman Catholic priest and state police to guarantee
safety and due process of law.
   Another gunman, in an interview Televisa broadcast Thursday
morning, said all the hostages were being treated well.
   Asked where they could go if given safe passage, he replied: ``I
wouldn't be able to tell you where we could go. We can't turn
ourselves in. They want to kill us.''
   Hostages told the media by telephone during the siege the gunmen
were getting them food and beverages.
   Jesus Acosta, a spokesman for the local Red Cross, said one of
its rescue workers was among those killed in a gunfight Wednesday
between police and the gunmen.
   He said the others slain were a customer, bank official and
teller, and a policeman who was in the bank on business at the time
of the robbery and tried to prevent it.

   Julia Child, television's ``The

being hospitalized with a fractured hip suffered in a fall, a
medical center spokeswoman said Thursday.
   The 75-year-old Mrs. Child broke her hip Monday at her Montecito
condominium and was expected to be at Cottage Hospital for another
week, said spokeswoman Janet O'Neill. Mrs. Child was in good
condition Thursday.
   ``She's not eating much, but our executive chef did send her up
some French bread. She said it was like a breath of spring. He told
her he has some fresh salmon anytime she's ready,'' Ms. O'Neill
said.
   Mrs. Child and her husband of 41 years, Paul, live in
Massachusetts, but since 1981 have spent their winters in
Montecito, for decades a fashionable enclave in the Santa Barbara
area along the Southern California coast.

<HEAD>Hijackers Wanted To Hide Hostages In Beirut, Report Claims</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The hijackers of a Kuwaiti airliner originally
planned to land in Lebanon, blow up the plane and keep the
passengers hostage in Beirut, a PLO mediator in the hijacking was
quoted as saying Thursday.
   Malaz Abdo, deputy director of the Palestine Liberation
Organization office in Cyprus, said the plan failed because Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad refused to let the plane land in the
Lebanese capital, according to by Rome's Paese Sera newspaper.
   Syria is the main power-broker in Lebanon, which has been torn
by 12 years of civil war.
   Abdo acted as a mediator in negotiations with the hijackers when
the Kuwait Airways jet landed in Larnaca, Cyprus. Paese Sera
released excerpts of an interview to be published Friday.
   The jumbo jet was hijacked April 5 between Bangkok, Thailand,
and Kuwait and landed in Iran, Cyprus and finally in Algeria, where
the 31 remaining passengers were freed on Wednesday. The hijackers
killed two hostages during the ordeal.
   According to Abdo's account given by the Communist-aligned
daily, the terrorists wanted to land the plane in Beirut, unload
the passengers, hold them in hideouts in the city and blow up the
aircraft.
   But Assad, whose troops control the area, spoke by telephone
with the emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, and agreed
to prevent the plane from landing in Beirut, the report said. No
other details were given.
   The plane went to Larnaca after first being forced to land in
Iran. The hijackers had demanded the release of 17 prisoners in
Kuwait.

   Two California dial-a-porn operators were
fined $600,000 each by the FCC on Thursday for transmitting obscene
material across state lines and for not restricting access to their
messages to children and non-consenting adults.
   ``Some so-called dial-a-porn providers are blatantly
disregarding the law which required that access by minors be
restricted pursuant to commission regulation,'' FCC Chairman Dennis
R. Patrick said in announcing the fines. ``We intend to enforce
this law.''
   The companies, Audio Enterprises Inc. of Mill Valley and
Intercambio Inc. of San Jose, were fined for interstate
transmission of obscene material and failure to restrict such
transmissions from minors and non-consenting adults. The maximum
fine is $50,000 for each day of violation.
   ``The ultimate in sleeze deserves the ultimate ... penalty,''
FCC Commissioner James H. Quello said. ``They need to know we mean
business.''
   Gerald Brock, chief of the FCC common carrier bureau, said the
$600,000 fines were based on the amount of money the companies made
during the commission's monitoring process.
   In an 11-month period, AT&T received $5.5 million from calls
made to one Audio Enterprises Inc. line, Patrick said. Of that
amount, Audio Enterprises received $650,000, he said. Intercambio
Inc. received $297,000 from its operation.
   The decision was the result of an FCC investigation triggered by
complaints alleging that unimpeded access to the sexually explicit
messages resulted in the molestation of one 10-year-old girl and so
disturbed a 16-year-old boy that he had to enter weekly psychiatric
theraphy.
   The companies have 30 days to pay or seek reduction of the fines.
   Current FCC regulations direct the dial-a-porn companies to
restrict their messages through access codes, message scrambling or
use of credit card numbers.
   Upon being notified last December of the complaints, both
companies said they did not have the capacity to provide access
screening and denied that the messages were obscene. Intercambio
also argued that it had not violated the regulation because it
never intended to transmit to minors or on an interstate basis.
   In a statement, AT&T said its policy was ``to terminate service
at the FCC's direction for any customer found in violation of laws
concerning minor access to pornographic messages.''

   Vice President George Bush and his wife
Barbara paid $86,684 in 1987 income taxes on a total income of
$308,396, according to a tax return released by his office on
Thursday.
   That compares to the $115,486 that the Bushes reported paying
for 1986 on total income of $348,594.
   Bush's tax bill amounted to 28 percent of his total income in
1987, down from the 33 percent he paid in 1986, showing that he, as
President Reagan and many other Americans, benefited from the
sweeping tax-law changes that took effect for 1987 taxes.
   Bush's income included his $112,633 salary as vice president and
$2,048 in additional reimbursment from the government.
   His biggest chunk of outside income came from the blind trust he
and his wife set up when he took office, totaling $169,600 _
including $26,075 in capital gains, $31,264 in interest and
dividends and $112,261 in supplemental income.
   Precisely where this money came from was not detailed, under
terms of the blind trust agreement. Aides have said previously that
the trust is valued at about $1 million.
   Bush also reported $20,773 in ``passive income'' from his
interest in a liquefied natural gas barge.
   Bush's salary was up from the $97,900 he received in 1986,
reflecting a general raise in federal salaries.
   The main reason his total income was lower was because he had a
much lower level of capital gains _ income from sales of assets,
property or stock.
   In 1986, Bush reported total capital gains of $430,165,
apparently reflecting a decision by the trustees of his blind trust
to sell off assets before the new tax law changes took effect and
increased the tax on such gains.
   Bush has made returning to a lower rate of taxation on capital
gains a prime campaign theme, saying the decision to tax capital
gains at the same rate as other earnings stifles business
investment. Bush has proposed a capital gains tax of 15 percent.
   The Bushes claimed total deductions for 1987 of $53,314,
including $12,225 in contributions to 35 charities. The
contributions included $1,000 gifts to the Yale Alumni Fund and the
United Negro College Fund.
   Bush had made $89,588 in tax payments, including $32,588
withheld from his salary _ suggesting a refund of $2,904. However,
the vice president elected to have the money held and applied to
his 1988 taxes.
   Bush also reported $1,575 in royalties in 1987 on his book,
``Looking Forward,'' published by Doubleday last September.
   The vice president claimed $3,574 in deductions for business
meals and entertainment and $6,880 in miscellaneous business
deductions.
   Bush has released his tax returns annually.
   In January, he also released 14 years of previous returns in a
challenge to then-rival Sen. Bob Dole to do the same. Those returns
showed that 1986 was his biggest income year, and that over the
14-year period he paid taxes ranging from 3 percent to 41 percent
of his annual income.
   Bush's interest income included $66 from the White House credit
union.
   President Reagan released his tax return earlier this month. It
showed that he and his wife Nancy paid $86,638 in taxes on total
income of $345,359 _ down from their $92,460 tax bill on 1986 total
income of $336,640.
   The Internal Revenue Service estimates that by next year, when
the tax-law changes are fully in place, about three-quarters of all
Americans will have smaller tax bills than they had in 1986.

   Jesse Jackson launched a fresh attack Thursday
on Attorney General Edwin Meese III, played down talk of his own
potential as a vice presidential candidate and courted blue-collar
workers in a campaign visit here.
   Campaigning in advance of Tuesday's Pennsylvania primary, the
Democratic presidential contender cited the longstanding legal
controversy surrounding Meese.
   ``I want a Justice Department that stands for justice ... an
attorney general that goes back and forth to court as a prosecutor
for the people and not as a defender for himself,'' he said in a
speech.
   At a news conference afterward, Jackon declined to comment on
his chances of being named the vice presidential nominee.
   Some of Jackson's top associates, including campaign chairman
Willie Brown and campaign manager Gerald Austin, have been raising
the possibility of Jackson as a running mate for Michael Dukakis _
if Dukakis emerged victorious in the struggle for the nomination.
   Jackson he said he intends to do nothing to damage the party's
chances of winning the presidency in November.
   ``I seek to be a healer in this process, and a builder,'' he
said.
   The candidate delivered the message of ``economic justice'' that
has been a mainstay of his campaign.
   ``Profits are up, wages are down, factories are closing, and
workers are abandoned,'' he told a crowd of about 4,000 people who
huddled together and shivered in a downtown park as a cold wind
blew off nearby Lake Erie.
   ``Let's rebuild America and put the workers back to work
...Don't let the voices of the status quo break your spirit,'' he
said.
   In other campaign contests, Jackson has been boosted by a
coalition of economically struggling workers, farmers and students,
and he was going after that mix here.
   ``I think that jobs for blue-collar workers is a very important
issue at this time,'' said Barbara Seidler, 54, of Erie, a
registered Republican.
   ``I believe he is for the people,'' said Charles Booth, 53, an
Erie machine shop manager. ``He knows what the people really need.''
   Jackson said he supports changes in the National Labor Relations
Board to make the agency a mediation service and not ``a
strike-breaking board.''
   Jackson also brushed aside his defeat at Dukakis' hands in the
New York primary on Tuesday. ``I always run against great odds,''
he said, adding that his campaign in Pennsylvania was ``very much
alive.''
   From Erie, Jackson headed for Philadelphia, where he toured a
drug-infested area.

   The crew of the Korean Air Lines plane shot
down by Soviet fighters in 1983 negligently made the flight knowing
the navigation system was not working, a lawyer for the victims'
relatives argued Thursday.
   Donald Madole, lead counsel for a committee that represents the
relatives of those killed in the Sept. 1, 1983 crash of Flight 007,
said there was abundant evidence to show that the crew chose to
continue the flight even though it determined in Alaska that the
navigation system was not properly set before takeoff from
Anchorage.
   A total of 269 passengers and crew died when the flight, which
originated in New York City, was shot down over the Sea of Japan
after straying off course into Soviet air space.
   The plane ``ended up 320 miles off course'' because the inertial
navigation system (INS) had been improperly set during a fueling
stop in Anchorage, Madole said.
   ``From the moment that airplane took off it was never, never on
course,'' he told U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr.
   ``The crew deliberately attempted to conceal their failure to
either properly stabilize the INS or set it up properly,'' Madole
said.
   The pilot and crew knew the journey without navigation guides
would lead the plane into a dangerous area where it could be shot
down without warning if it strayed into Soviet airspace, Madole
said.
   ``Obviously the crew knew the danger and chanced it anyway,'' he
said.
   But KAL attorney George Tompkins said these allegations were
based on ``opinion, surmise, conjecture'' rather than evidence.
   ``There is no need for a trial in this case,'' Tompkins told
Robinson, who has presided over five years of litigation arising
from the crash.
   Madole said the plaintiffs should be given a chance to press
their claim of punitive damages at a trial.
   Even before the flight had left the coast of Alaska for the long
journey across open seas, the crew had violated a number of
aviation regulations, Madole said.
   The plane should have flown directly over the radio beacon at
Bethel, Alaska to check its position when the crew determined it
was 15 miles off course, Madole said. But the crew members ignored
their duty and didn't fly the plane over the radio beacon because
they knew the navigational system was not functioning.
   Once the plane passed over the coast, ``there is no white
highway line across the Pacific,'' Madole said.
   The pilot, Capt. Chun Byung-in, wanted to avoid returning to
Anchorage to reset the nevigation system because such an emergency
landing would force him to dump 100,000 pounds of jet fuel. Chun
knew this costly and time-consuming detour would anger airline
officials and passengers, Madole said.
   He cited the deposition testimony of former KAL pilot Park Yong
Man who said he and Chun had spoken the night before the ill-fated
flight about four other incidents that year in which KAL crews had
made emergency landings to reset navigation systems.
   Chun had told Park ``if it happened to him he would go on'' to
avoid losing face with his superiors and friends, Madole said. ``It
would be a terrible disgrace in Korea if they have to come back.''
   Authorities have not been able to determine exactly how the
plane ended up 320 miles off course because the cockpit and flight
data recorders were never recovered. But aviation experts theorize
that incorrect data was punched into the computerized navigation
system before the plane took off from Anchorage.
   If the judge dismisses the case, the airline would only be
liable for $75,000 per passenger under international aviation
conventions. But the plaintiffs are seeking to collect far greater
amounts by holding the airline liable for punitive damages.

   A spring storm dumped snow on parts of Arizona, Utah and Wyoming
on Thursday, and more snow was forecast from the mountains of
southern California to Wyoming.
   Rain, changing to snow in the mountains, reached from the
Pacific Northwest across the northern Rockies into the northern
Plains.
   Flagstaff, Ariz. received 8 inches of snow, with four inches
falling in one hour.
   Heavy snow also hit mountains in southern Utah, with 14 inches
recorded at Brian Head Ski Resort by Thursday morning and 8 inches
at Long Valley Junction. In northern Montana, 2 inches of snow were
recorded in parts of the Big Horn Mountains, and an advisory for
more snow extending into Friday was posted for the Big Horn

   A man who threatened to loose a
500-pound Bengal tiger on the Louisiana State University campus
unless given a job ``snapped'' and deserves compassion, the
school's basketball coach said Thursday.
   Coach Dale Brown signed a $10,000 bail bond to free from jail
Moacyr ``Gato'' Cezar, who locked himself in the outer cage of the
LSU mascot for more than four hours Wednesday. Cezar, 48, was
charged with criminal mischief and robbery.
   Brown last summer had befriended Cezar, who worked in LSU's
basketball dorm and had demanded to speak to the coach during the
standoff.
   ``What happened to Gato could have happened to any of us,''
Brown said after Cezar was freed from jail and taken to a hospital
for psychiatric evaluation. ``His personal problems were
overwhelming and he snapped.''
   School officials won't make any decisions about Cezar's future
until the charge is settled, said university spokesman Jim Crain.
The man filled out a job application during Wednesday's standoff,
but officials made no guarantees.
   Cezar, a former star Brazilian basketball player, was befriended
by Brown when the coach visited Sao Paolo last summer.
   He was a teacher in Brazil and came to this country on a
temporary visa. He supervised the LSU basketball dormitory while
taking courses to improve his English.
   Cezar, a father of two, needed money to send to his family and
wanted a work permit because his visa was expiring, Brown said.
   ``He is a frustrated, proud man who was just looking for a job,
who didn't want charity,'' said Brown.
   Cezar seized the cage keys from a student trainer Wednesday,
threatening the man with what turned out to be a toy gun, officials
said. He entered only the barred outer cage that surrounds the main
cage containing the tiger.
   An LSU basketball player Jose Vargas, a native of the Dominican
Republic, talked Cezar out of the cage.
   At one point during the standoff, some of the hundreds of
students who came to watch chanted: ``Tiger bait! Tiger bait!'' _
the cry raised at LSU sporting events when opposing teams enter.
   ``To those of you who shouted `Tiger bait,' what can I say?''
Brown said. ``May you never experience sadness and loneliness and
may you find a love that you couldn't give last night.''

   ``The Last Emperor,'' the prize-winning film
depicting the life of the last man to occupy China's imperial
throne, will be shown in theaters here starting in June, the
official Xinhua News Agency said Thursday.
   It quoted Chen Haosu, vice minister of radio, film and
television, as saying the movie is now being dubbed into Chinese.
   Chen spoke at a party to celebrate the success of the film,
which captured nine Academy Awards this year including best picture
and best director.
   Also at the party were Ying Ruocheng, vice minister of culture,
who played the prison warden in the film, and Pu Jie, younger
brother of last emperor Pu Yi.
   Pu Jie said the movie by Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci
was faithful to the life of his brother as depicted in Pu Yi's
autobiography, ``From Emperor to Citizen.''
   The report noted that the movie, which follows Pu Yi through his
life as child emperor, puppet ruler under the Japanese, prisoner of
the communists and finally a gardener in the People's Republic,
engendered controversy in China.
   Deputies at a session of the National People's Congress
complained that Chinese law was broken when the movie crew shot
interior scenes in the Imperial Palace. Others said Bertolucci was
too liberal with historical facts.
   Xinhua noted that Bertolucci dedicated the Oscars to ``all the
Chinese and China.''
   ``But whether the movie is acceptable to the Chinese audience
remains a question,'' it said.

<HEAD>Meese Doesn't See Resignation Now, Won't Rule Out Future</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said Thursday
he meets the highest ethical standards expected of public officials
and knows of no factor ``right now that would cause me to resign.''
   But the attorney general, in an interview published in Friday's
editions of USA Today, did not rule out resigning before the end of
President Reagan's term.
   ``I've never set a particular limit of how long I would stay or
how long I wouldn't stay. A lot would depend upon my own
post-federal service employment situation and so on,'' he said.
   Meese said he does not believe he is a liability either to the
administration or to the presidential bid of Vice President George
Bush.
   ``I don't feel that I'm tainted _ I feel that there have been
false accusations and false charges,'' Meese said.
   Meese has been under criminal investigation for nearly a year by
independent counsel James McKay, who is looking into his ties to
the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and a $1 billion Iraqi oil
pipeline project.
   McKay is also known to be looking into Mrs. Meese's
$40,000-a-year job with the Multiple Sclerosis Society. Mrs.
Meese's salary is underwritten by The Bender Foundation, a
tax-exempt philanthropy run by a Washington real estate family.
   The Associated Press reported last week that a partnership
headed by Howard M. Bender, the foundation's vice president, owned
a building for which the government signed a $50 million lease for
a Justice Department office building in May 1987. Thirteen days
after signing the lease, the Bender partnership sold the building
for a $22.6 million profit.
   Meese has denied any wrongdoing and said he didn't have anything
to do with the lease.
   Meese declined to answer whether he would resign if his presence
in Reagan's Cabinet became a liability for Bush. But he said the
only reason an attorney general should resign is if he is indicted
or if the president asks him to step down.
   ``I don't know of any factor right now that would cause me to
resign,'' Meese said.
   He said public officials should meet the highest ethical
standards and added, ``I personally believe that, in my case, I
meet that standard and that's why I'm interested in having the
facts come out.''
   The president has continued to express his ``total support ...
and total confidence,'' Meese said.
   Meese said he usually meets with his personal lawyer after work
or on Sundays: ``It ... is not taking me away from the office
during office hours hardly at all, and in no way is it hampering
the decision-making of the department.''

   The 1988 Democratic presidential marathon dwindled down to two
survivors on Thursday as Sen. Albert Gore Jr. called it quits.
Front-runner Michael Dukakis said Jesse Jackson's showing
guarantees him consideration when it comes to picking a vice
presidential running mate, but nothing more.
   ``If I were to finish second, it wouldn't entitle me to anything
more than consideration, period,'' Dukakis said in an interview in
Boston before he flew off to campaign in Pennsylvania and Ohio, the
next primary states on the calendar.
   Jackson spent the day in Pennsylvania, buoyed by an endorsement
from the Philadelphia Daily News. ``I am the alternative in the
Democratic Party. I am the alternative to Reaganomics,'' he said as
he made the rounds on a hectic campaign day.
   ``We can win. We can win,'' he said.
   The ubiquitous public opinion polls suggested otherwise.
   A survey taken for television stations in Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh showed Dukakis favored by 55 percent to 24 percent for
Jackson and 6 percent for Gore. That represented an improvement in
Dukakis' position since his big victory in the New York primary,
which established his control over the presidential race.
   Pennsylvania votes next week and offers 178 Democratic delegates.
   Jackson, with Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode at his side,
toured a neighborhood notorious for drug sales on Thursday night,
calling on hundreds of blacks and Hispanics who turned out to see
him to stay away from drugs.
   ``When I become president, the drug pusher is in trouble,'' he
said.
   Dukakis flew to Cleveland to campaign in advance of Ohio's
primary, a week after the Pennsylvania contest. He made a strong
attack on Reagan administration trade and labor policies.
   ``We have a Labor Department and an NLRB (National Labor
Relations Board) that won't stand up for America because we have
got an attorney general who couldn't tell the difference between
anti-trust and antifreeze,'' Dukakis said.
   Gore, meanwhile, exited the race with a quip.
   ``I was going great until I turned 40,'' he told a roomful of
family members and supporters in the Senate.
   The Tennessee senator said he would technically remain a
candidate so his delegates can attend the Democratic National
Convention this July in Atlanta.
   But, he said, ``I will no longer campaign in the hope of winning
the nomination. ... I want no part of a stop Jackson or stop
Dukakis movement.
   ``The only person I want to stop is George Bush and we're going
to stop George Bush.''
   Vice President George Bush is clearly heading for the Republican
nomination, and the only suspense is when he will amass the 1,139
delegates needed for clinching it. The best guess is Tuesday night
in Pennsylvania.
   Gore, who sought the nomination as a Southern, moderate
alternative to the other contenders, left the campaign at least
$1.5 million in debt after failing to build on his Southern
successes in any Northern or Midwestern states. His campaign had
soared March 8 on Super Tuesday when he carried Kentucky, Arkansas,
North Carolina, Oklahoma and his native Tennessee, and he holds
more than 400 delegates in the Associated Press count.
   Under Democratic Party rules, Jackson would have gained 34 of
Gore's delegates right away and Dukakis would have gotten 29 if
Gore had made a clean break and dropped out of the race entirely.
   Dukakis leads in the delegate chase with more than 1,000 and
Jackson holds more than 800.
   The Massachusetts governor is the prohibitive favorite for the
nomination, given his delegate lead and the momentum he gained with
his New York triumph. But in an interview with The AP, he said it
was too early to talk of picking a running mate.
   ``I have spent literally zero time thinking about it. And I will
not, unless and until I have either won the nomination or it looks
as if it's pretty well in hand,'' he said.
   Even so, he seemed to brush aside a prediction from party
chairman Paul Kirk that the vice presidential running mate would be
a senator from the South or Southwest. ``I wouldn't make that
judgement at all,'' Dukakis said.
   If Dukakis wasn't ready to discuss the issue, others were.
   ``Obviously you look at regions where you could use some help,''
said former Gov. Charles Robb of Virginia. ``The South and West are
the regions. You also look at a philosophical segment where you
could use some shoring up and I guess that would be with moderate
conservative voters.''
   Robb, who had urged Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia to run for
president, said he would like to see Nunn as the vice presidential
candidate but only if the senator were offered the opportunity to
serve as secretary of defense at the same time.

   After 6{ years and an expense of
$500,000, Barbara and Frederick Hughes have a jury finding that
they were slandered _ and a buck apiece in their pockets.
   ``I got my name cleared,'' Hughes said Wednesday after jurors
ruled that Greater Palm Beach Symphony Chairman Ethel Stone, 73,
slandered the Hugheses during a disagreement over funds that was
aired at a symphony board meeting in August 1981.
   All three were involved in fund-raising and operations of the
symphony, a central part of the social scene in socially conscious
Palm Beach.
   Barbara Hughes, 59, worked as treasurer for the symphony in
1981. Frederick, 72, was on the board of directors.
   So it caused something of an uproar in the posh resort community
when Mrs. Hughes and Ms. Stone, both of Palm Beach, accused each
other of misappropriating symphony property and money.
   Ms. Stone sued the Hugheses for defamation. The Hugheses
countersued Ms. Stone.
   Ms. Stone agreed to settle her lawsuit against the Hugheses out
of court in December last year when Hughes' insurance company
offered $150,000. The Hugheses plan to appeal that settlement.
   ``We spent over a half-million dollars,'' Mrs. Hughes said,
referring to their own lawsuit. In return for their time and
expense, a jury awarded the couple $2 in damages.
   At that 1981 meeting, Ms. Stone told the board _ in view of
television cameras _ that the Hugheses had improperly handled
symphony money. During the two-week trial, jurors watched tapes of
the statements, which her lawyer, James Brown, said Ms. Stone made
after consulting with an attorney.
   After Palm Beach Circuit Judge Daniel Hurley read the verdict
Wednesday, Ms. Stone said she thought she had been advised before
the meeting by the best law firm in town.
   Despite the victory in principle for the Hugheses, trial analyst
Kus Nell, who assisted attorney Thomas O'Grady in representing the
Hugheses, thought the six jurors ignored the damage done to the
Hugheses' when they determined the $2 award.
   ``I'm stunned how $1 will compensate Mr. Hughes,'' Nell said,
noting how much more Ms. Stone reaped in December from the
out-of-court settlement by the insurance company.
   ``She never went to trial, she never proved a thing, and she got
$150,000,'' Nell said. ``We went to court for two weeks and got
this.''
   The trial attracted attention for the years of bitterness and
thick volumes of court documents it has generated.
   After the charges and countercharges were made in 1981, the
Hugheses told the state attorney's office that symphony records and
$100,000 in cash and donations were missing.
   After seven months of scrutiny, investigators criticized sloppy
accounting procedures but found nothing of criminal substance.

   A 2-month-old baby found dead in a trash can
Thursday was drowned by his mother the day she told police two men
had snatched him from his stroller on a Brooklyn street, police
said.
   Lucrezia Gentile, 36, was charged with murder in the death of
her son, Stephen, said police spokesman Sgt. Maurice Howard. She
was awaiting arraignment Thursday night.
   The infant's body was discovered not far from the family home
after a day of questioning in which the mother was given a
polygraph test and told detectives where to find the baby, said
Chief of Detectives Robert Colangelo.
   ``We believe that Lucrezia Gentile drowned her 2-month-old son
Stephen in the bathtub of their residence at approximately 9:30
a.m. yesterday,'' Colangelo said.
   Mrs. Gentile then ``dressed the baby, placed him in a white
plastic bag, put him in his stroller, walked several blocks ... and
placed the baby in a green trash can,'' he said.
   Mrs. Gentile, whose husband, John Gentile, 32, is a part-time
employee of the U.S. Marshal's office, had told police the baby was
taken from his stroller Wednesday by two men in a sedan who had
stopped her to ask directions.
   She said the abduction occurred as she was on her way to the
grammar school attended by her 7-year-old son. About an hour
earlier, Mrs. Gentile had said, a woman had called to say the son
was ill at the school.
   Sgt. Peter Sweeney, a police spokesman, had said shortly before
the baby was found that no ranson demand had been made and police
had no leads on who took the baby or why.
   A $5,000 reward was posted earlier Thursday by Thomas McDonald,
a retired firefighter and longtime resident of the Gentiles'
neighborhood.
   ``I want the return of the baby, that's the important thing,''
McDonald had said. ``I just hope they don't compound kidnapping
with murder.''
   ``I feel violated and so do my neighbors,'' said McDonald. ``You
should see the parents today, holding onto their children,
hollering at their children. The parents are scared.''
   Gentile has worked as a guard for the U.S. marshal's office for
about a year, said Chief Deputy Marshal Mike Pizzi. Gentile had
retired with a disability from the Conrail police force in 1984.

   The head of Drexel Burnham Lambert's ``junk
bond'' business, who is under scrutiny in the Wall Street insider
trading scandals, was subpoenaed by a congressional panel Thursday
to testify next week, sources said.
   Michael R. Milken, the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based architect of
the nation's $100 billion ``junk bond'' market of debt securities
that frequently are used to finance hostile takeover attempts, is
scheduled to testify April 27 before the House Energy and Commerce
Committee's subcommittee on oversight and investigations, said the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The chief executive officer of the investment banking firm,
Frederick Joseph, is scheduled to testify next Thursday, but a
subpoena was not considered necessary in his case, one source said.
   ``Milken did not want to appear,'' the source said, adding that
the subcommittee, led by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., then decided
to issue a subpoena for him.
   Kevin Madigan, the attorney at Drexel's Beverly Hills office who
sources said received the subpoena for Milken, was not in his
office Thursday afternoon and queries were directed to Steve
Anreder, the firm's spokesman in New York.
   Asked about the subpoena, Anreder said, ``We can't confirm it,
but we anticipate hearing next week.''
   The subcommittee has been investigating Drexel for the last six
months, looking into its operations, its high-yield junk-bond
department in Beverly Hills, the corporate finance department, the
mergers and acquisitions department and the executive committee, a
source said.
   A notice to subcommittee members from Michael Barrett, the
panel's chief counsel and staff director, said that next
Wednesday's hearing would be held to receive testimony from Milken
``relating to the subcommittee's investigation into the operations
of the nation's securities markets and the effectiveness of the
federal securities laws.''
   Drexel and Milken have been under a cloud since the government's
disclosure that Wall Street's onetime top takeover speculator, Ivan
F. Boesky, admitted involvement in insider trading and aided the
government's investigation of others allegedly involved in such
illegal activity. Boesky paid the Securities and Exchange
Commission a record $100 million following his downfall in 1986.
   Both the SEC and the U.S. attorney's office have been conducting
investigations of Drexel.
   Neither Drexel nor Milken has been charged with a crime and both
repeatedly have asserted their innocence.
   Milken, whose annual earnings have been estimated from between
$40 million to $80 million, is responsible for one of Drexel's most
profitable and innovative operations.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ President Leslie Manigat said
Thursday that Haiti still is gripped by a ``climate of fear'' and
building democracy will be difficult.
   ``No change can be made without resistance. Change does not take
place in one day,'' Manigat said during his first news conference
since taking office Feb. 7.
   Manigat also said that a government investigation into the
violence that forced the cancellation of the Nov. 19 presidential
election is going slowly. The investigaton had not reached any
conclusions about who was behind the rampage that left 34 people
dead, he said.
   ``We are simply lacking witnesses who have the courage to
testify,'' Manigat said. ``The climate of fear from the time of the
Duvaliers still exists.''
   Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier took power in 1957 and ruled
until 1971, when his son Jean-Claude took control. The younger
Duvalier fled to exile in France on Feb. 7, 1986, in the face of
widespread opposition.
   Manigat was elected Jan. 17 in a government-run election
boycotted by the main opposition parties.
   The Nov. 19 balloting was called off after gunmen shot into
lines of voters at polling stations and other assailants hacked
people to death.
   Witnesses said soldiers took part in the shooting, and main
opposition candidates said the military organized the bloodshed to
ruin the election, the first free balloting in three decades.
   Manigat tacitly anknowledged critics' complaints that the army
still runs Haiti.
   ``This government has had an unquestionable desire to change
things, but we can't break big interests and bad habits
overnight,'' he said.
   But Manigat he contended that his government is an improvement.
   ``We in the government are men of dialogue. Nobody will make us
fall into the trap of the Duvaliers, pushing us to repressive
tactics to stay in power,'' he said.
   He repeated his intention ``to put the army at the service of
development.''
   Manigat had no comment on the U.S. indictment in Miami last
month of army Col. Jean-Claude Paul on drug trafficking charges.
Paul is commander of the powerful Dessalines battalion of 700
soldiers quartered next to the National Palace.

   A filmmaker from Josef Stalin's home republic of
Georgia has been awarded the Lenin Prize for a triology of movies
portraying Stalin's terror, Tass said Thursday.
   Tengiz Abuladze was honored with the top cultural prize for the
films ``Molba,'' ``Drevo Zhelaniya,'' and the 1984 film that
stunned Soviets with its portrayal of the Stalin period,
``Pokayaniye.''
   Censors withheld ``Pokayaniye'' for two years. When it was
released in late 1986, it shocked millions of Soviet viewers and
became one of the first major signs of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
effort to loosen some restrictions on cultural expression.
   Georgy Markov, chairman of the government committee awarding the
prizes in literature, art and architecture, told Tass the three
films helped Soviet society deal with the legacy of Stalin's
decades in power.
   Millions of Soviets were shot, imprisoned or exiled in the
dictator's purges.
   The honor accorded Abuladze was another indication of official
intent to continue exposing the excesses of Stalin's rule.
   An evaluation of Stalin's place in Soviet history remains a
topic of debate in the official press. This year officials
exonerated Stalin rival Nikolai I. Bukharin and more than 20 others
shot after a show trial in 1938.

   A grand jury indicted 10 men Thursday in

told police that bystanders at a cockfight ignored her cries and
joined in the attack.

District Attorney Rudy Gutierrez said in announcing the indictments.
   The 10 were arrested within days of the alleged attack that
shocked this southern Texas town of 5,000, where many residents are
related.
   The 19-year-old woman, a mother of two, told authorities she was
abducted while walking home from a relative's house and gang raped
over four hours.
   She said the attack began at a ranch north of town where a
cockfight was being held. She said her attackers urged men at the
cockfight to join in, and some did, despite her pleas for help.
   Some of the defendants, who were charged with offenses including
sexual assault and kidnapping, had charged she was a willing
participant.
   Richard Yaegear, a family friend, said the woman, her husband
and children are in a secret location in Corpus Christi because
they had been threatened.
   ``They have to get out of San Diego,'' said Yaeger. ``They'll
never be able to come back here. These people here are acting like
(the victim and her family) are in the wrong.''
   Those testifying before the grand jury Thursday included a
12-year-old boy who claimed to have seen part of the attack,
Guttierez said.
   Officials also are investigating a report that a 14-year-old boy
was involved in the sexual attack, said County Attorney Abelardo
Garza.

   Riot troops hurled tear gas
grenades and fired in the air Thursday night to break up a group of
demonstrators headed for the U.S. Embassy.
   The protesters had been part of a crowd of 1,500 to 2,000 people
who marched peacefully to the National Congress earlier Thursday to
demonstrate against the Honduran government and U.S. policy in this
Central American country.
   Two weeks ago protesters attacked the U.S. Embassy compound,
burning and sacking the U.S. Consulate. Five people were killed in
that riot, which was fueled by indignation over the deportation of
an alleged drug trafficker to the United States.
   Thursday night, about 200 people shouting ``Embassy, Embassy''
broke off from a larger group of protesters and headed for the U.S.
diplomatic mission on the eastern outskirts of this capital.
   About 50 soldiers and police threw tear-gas grenades, dispersing
the protesters.
   The demonstrators regrouped, cutting off a small contingent of
what appeared to be young and ill-trained troops, who fired long
bursts of fire from their M-16s into the air. The sound of shots
sparked panic in the neighborhood.
   Some demonstrators taunted and threw stones at the troopers, who
at intervals would advance behind metal shields.
   At least one person was seen arrested. There were no immediate
reports of injuries.
   During the milelong march earlier Thursday, protesters chanted
slogans calling for the expulsion of the approximately 1,100 U.S.
troops based in Honduras, the removal of U.S.-backed Nicaraguan
rebels from Honduras and the defense of the Honduran Constitution.
   They condemned the government of President Jose Azcona and what
they called his subservience to Washington.
   ``Yankee garbage, out of Honduras,'' and ``If the Yankees don't
get out, in Honduras they will die,'' shouted the demonstrators.
Both chants rhyme in Spanish.
   The marchers, most of them students, walked to the National
Congress, where they listened to speeches condemning Azcona and the
United States.
   About 500 demonstrators proceeded from there to the nearby
Central Penitentiary, where they shouted for the release of inmates
they consider political prisoners.
   A group then tried to go to the U.S. Embassy.
   One of the issues the marchers protested was the forced
extradition of suspected drug trafficker Juan Ramon Matta. Honduran
police, working with U.S. agents, arrested Matta at his Tegucigalpa
home on April 5 had him flown to the United States.
   The Honduran Constitution prohibits the extradition of Honduran
citizens.
   Matta is in federal prison in Marion, Ill..
   The U.S. Embassy estimates damage to the consulate building in
the April 7 riot at between $4 million and $6 million and has asked
for reimbursement from the government.

   President Reagan said farewell to the White
House press corps Thursday night, saying he hoped the epitaph for
his sometimes strained relationship with the media will be ``he
gave as good as he got.''
   Reagan gave the sentimental goodbye during his seventh and last
White House Correspondents Association dinner appearance, after
joking about the recent spate of books from former aides, the
presidential campaign and the treatment he's gotten from the press
corps.
   Looking over the crowd of Washington elected officials, Cabinet
members and celebrity guests from Hollywood, he said, ``It looks
like the index of Larry Speakes' book.''
   He noted that Speakes had criticized his mental powers, when
Speakes said in his recently published book that preparing Reagan
for a press conference was like ``reinventing the wheel.''
   ``I was around when the wheel was invented,'' Reagan said.
   ``Even (White House chief of staff) Howard Baker is writing a
book. It's going to be called `Three By Five: the Measure of a
President,''' he said, in a reference to his use of index cards in
meetings.
   And joking about the frequent complaints that he does not hold
enough meetings with the press, he said the presidential campaign
has left him ``feeling a little lonely.''
   ``I've been so desperate for attention, I almost considered
holding a news conference,'' Reagan said.
   After the jokes, Reagan gave a warmhearted toast, applauded by
the press corps and guests, ``to this God-blessed land.''
   He said presidents and the press could agree and work together
``to keep this great miracle alive because the world is a better
place because of us. To the United States of America,'' he said,
raising his glass.
   ``Every president seeks to use the press,'' Reagan said. ``The
press can take care of itself and hopefully so can a president. I
hope that my epitaph will be with relations with the White House
press corps, `He gave as good as he got.'''
   Several journalism awards were handed out at the annual dinner.
   Gerald F. Seib, White House correspondent for The Wall Street
Journal, won two awards for his stories on the Reagan
administration's approach to the December 1987 summit between
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Seib was presented the Merriman Smith Award and the Aldo Beckman
Award.
   The Smith Award, named for the late UPI White House
correspondent, carries a $500 prize, as does the Beckman Award,
named after the late Chicago Tribune White House correspondent.
   Second place in the Smith competition went to Lawrence M.
O'Rourke, of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, for his Nov. 7, 1987
story about the events that led to the withdrawal of federal judge
Douglas Ginsburg as a Supreme Court nominee.
   Jonathan Fuerbringer of The New York Times was named the winner
of the Barnet Nover Memorial Award for his day-to-day coverage of
Congress last year.
   David Rogers of The Wall Street Journal won second place for his
coverage of the Iran-Contra story. Nancy Schwerzler of the
Baltimore Sun received honorable mention for her daily coverage of
Congress.
   Barnet Nover was bureau chief of The Denver Post's Washington
bureau from 1947 to 1971. He was an expert on foreign affairs.
   George Anthan of The Des Moines Register was named the winner of
the 44th annual Raymond Clapper Memorial Award for his 1987 series
of investigative articles on widespread contamination of poultry
during processing.
   Jim Stewart of Cox Newspapers won second place for his
investigative series on a crash aboard the aircraft carrier Nimitz
that caused the deaths of seven U.S. servicemen.
   Keith C. Epstein and Mary Beth Lane of the Cleveland Plain
Dealer received honorable mention for their series on a cover-up by
the Air Force of radioactive contamination at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base near Dayton, Ohio.
   Raymond Clapper, a Washington correspondent and columnist for
Scripps Howard Newspapers, was killed in an airplane crash while
covering the invasion of the Marshall Islands in the closing days
of Pacific action during World War II.
   The winners of both the Clapper and Nover awards received
$1,500. The second place prize was $500.

<HEAD>Three Gendarmes Killed in New Caledonia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least three French police officers
were killed Friday in the South Pacific territory of New Caledonia,
apparently by Melanesian separatists, the Australian Broadcasting
Corp. said.
   The station, reporting from Noumea, the capital, quoted
government radio as saying the gendarmes were shot on the outer
island of Ouvea, 90 miles away.
   It said a town hall was set alight earlier Friday in the
French-ruled territory and a small bomb exploded in Noumea. There
were no immediate reports of casualties in the earlier attacks.
   The territory's indigenous Melanesians have vowed to boycott
Sunday's regional elections which coincide with the French
presidential election. Many of the Melanesians, known as Kanaks,
are seeking independence for New Caledonia.
   Australian Broadcasting Corp. said a group of about 20 Kanaks
armed with guns and machetes were involved in the killings.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attacks.
   More than 20 people have died in five years of riots, slayings
and clashes involving predominantly French settlers and Kanaks,
whose ancestors first arrived 4,000 years ago.
   New Caledonia, France's largest possession in the South Pacific,
is about 1,000 east of Australia.
   A Melanesian separatist leader, Jean-Marie Tjibaou, told a news
conference in Sydney last month his group planned a
``confrontation'' before the elections.
   But he said ``outright war'' was not possible because of the
French military presence on the island nation of 145,000. Kanaks
make up 43 percent of the population in the nickel-rich territory.
   Tjibaou heads the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front.
   Other major ethnic groups in New Caledonia are Wallisians,
Tahitians and Indonesians.

<TEXT>
   Fired Moscow Communist Party boss Boris N. Yeltsin
has defended the outspoken criticism of the slow pace of reform
that cost him his job, telling the official press that he did what
he thought was right.
   In another published report, Yegor K. Ligachev, the Kremlin No.
2 man considered a conservative counterforce to Yeltsin in Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's leadership, was reported to be in trouble with the
Soviet leader.
   The respected Madrid newspaper El Pais reported Thursday that
Ligachev had been removed from his duties as the party's chief
arbiter on ideological issues and head of party workers at an April
16 meeting.
   The New York Times reported Friday that the Politburo voted to
reduce Ligachev's powers and ordered him to take a two-month
vacation. It said Ligachev was forced to give up his role as a
supervisor of Soviet press and television.
   The paper said that Viktor M. Chebrikov, head of the KGB, had
defended Ligachev during the Politburo meeting, which it said took
place Tuesday.
   Unconfirmed reports circulating in Moscow said Ligachev recently
had been given a reprimand by Gorbachev, but it was unclear when or
why.
   The interview with Yeltsin, along with a large picture of him
and his grandson, was published in the first German-language
edition of the newspaper Moscow News, which appeared Thursday in
Moscow. The article was not in the weekly Russian language edition
that came out Wednesday.
   ``I spoke in a straightforward manner and said what I felt and
thought was correct,'' Yeltsin said in the interview, his first in
the official press since his firing. ``Someone said correctly: each
must think independently so that later not all suddenly see the
light at once.''
   He declined to say what he told the Communist Party Central
Committee at an Oct. 21 meeting that led to his firing three weeks
later. Yeltsin was hospitalized with heart trouble in November, and
since has been reassigned as a first deputy minister of
construction.
   Even though Moscow News is intended primarily for foreigners,
the appearance of an interview with Yeltsin was unusual and could
be a signal that he has recovered some prestige following his
denunciation by Gorbachev in mid-November for putting ``personal
ambitions above the interests of the party.''
   Yeltsin, 57, was considered to be among the staunchest
supporters of Gorbachev's efforts to reform the Soviet economy and
allow more openness. In his speech to the Central Committee, he
criticized the slow pace of reform and the party's style of
leadership.
   Some unconfirmed reports have said he attacked Ligachev
personally.
   Yeltsin was replaced as Moscow party chief by Lev N. Zaikov. In
February, Yeltsin was stripped of his position as a candidate, or
non-voting, member of the ruling Politburo.
   Yeltsin's firing was taken by some Moscow intellectuals as an
indication of the limits of Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or
greater openness. Gorbachev acknowledged that in a speech to
writers and artists in January, but denied that it signaled a
slowing of his reform efforts.
   Yeltsin was brought to Moscow by Gorbachev from the Ural
Mountain industrial city of Sverdlovsk to replace Viktor Grishin,
reported to be Gorbachev's main rival for the Communist Party
leadership in 1985.
   Moscow News said 102,000 copies of the first German-language
edition were printed in West Germany and sold at kiosks.
   It said editors in Moscow provide all the material for the
paper, which is composed, printed and distributed in West Germany.
It is printed in a larger format than the editions printed in five
other languages.
   In its story on Ligachev, El Pais cited unidentified informed
Soviet sources as saying the Politburo turned over his duties to
Gorbachev ally Alexander Yakovlev, secretary of the party's Central
Committee and the party's chief director of propaganda, press and
cultural matters.
   The paper's Moscow correspondent described the action as a
``failure of the political operation against Gorbachev'' by
conservative party figures who attracted attention following the
publication of a newspaper article defending Stalinist policies.
   Ligachev was said to have endorsed the article and guided
through its publication in the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya. The
Communist Party newspaper Pravda published a strongly worded
condemnaton of the critical article April 5.
   Ligachev has indicated in speeches on ideology during the past
year that he favors a less permissive attitude toward openness in
publishing than Gorbachev.
   Conservative writers have cited Ligachev's speeches in attacking
the increasingly critical articles that are appearing in Soviet
newspapers, including Moscow News.

<HEAD>British High Court Clears Computer Hackers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer hacker who sent messages to Prince
Philip's computer cannot be prosecuted under the country's
counterfeiting and forgery laws, Britain's highest court ruled
Thursday.
   Stephen Gold and Robert Schifreen were arrested separately in
1985 for breaking into the Prestel system, the information service
of British Telecom, the nation's telephone company.
   Gold, of Sheffield, and Schifreen, of London, were convicted in
1986 of nine offenses and fined $1,140 and $1,425, respectively.
   Five Law Lords of the House of Lords, members of an unelected
upper legislative chamber who have expertise as judges, unanimously
upheld a Court of Appeals ruling last year that said the two men
could not be prosecuted as charged under the Forgery and
Counterfeiting Act.
   ``Their conduct amounted in essence to dishonestly gaining
access to the relevant Prestel data bank by a trick,'' said Lord
Geoffrey Lane. ``That is not a criminal offense. If it is thought
desirable to make it so, that is a matter for the legislature
rather than the courts.''
   ``I knew from the start that the Forgery Act is not designed to
apply to unauthorized access to computers and that has now been
proved,'' said Schifreen. ``I am not saying computer hacking should
be legal, but there should be a specific law to cover it.''
   He said the messages left on Prince Philip's computer were not
``terribly interesting,'' mostly congratulations on the birth of
his grandson Prince William, the elder son of Prince Charles and
Princess Diana.

<TEXT>
   A man who led the search for his
girlfriend after she disappeared while they jogged in a park was
convicted of voluntary manslaughter Wednesday in her slaying.
   Bradley Page, 27, could receive up to 11 years in prison at
sentencing June 1 in the 1984 slaying of 21-year-old Roberta
``Bibi'' Lee, who was found bludgeoned to death and buried n a
shallow grave in Redwood Regional Park.
   Page remained free on his own recognizance.
   He was acquitted two years ago of murdering Lee but was ordered
retried after the jury deadlocked 8-4 in favor of a manslaughter
conviction.
   The trial centered on a statement Page gave police in which he
said he had bashed Lee's head repeatedly with a rock after a
lover's quarrel and dragged her body into the woods, then made love
to the corpse before scooping dirt and leaves over it with a hubcap.
   Page took the stand to renounce his confession as the ramblings
of a young man exhausted by hours of grueling questioning. He had
told officers he thought he had two personalities, one of which
could have committed the crime and blocked it out.
   According to testimony, the couple and a friend had gone jogging
in the park. The friend became separated from Lee and Page, but
waited for them at a park gate. Page arrived alone and said Lee had
gone down a different path.
   He said he had looked for her unsuccessfully for about 15
minutes.
   When one of Lee's roommates called Page the next day to say Lee
had not returned, he reported her disappearance to police and
during the next five weeks distributed flyers with Lee's picture
and description to news agencies.
   A month later, her half-nude body was found buried in a thicket.

Wednesdasy night for the longest season-opening losing streak _ 14
games.
   The hapless Orioles fell to the Milwaukee Brewers 8-6 as Jim
Gantner's bases-loaded single sparked a four-run fifth inning.
Baltimore had led 5-3 in the fifth inning in its highest-scoring
game of the season.
   Baltimore, in losing its first 14 games of the season, overtook
both the 1904 Washington Senators and the 1920 Detroit Tigers, who
lost their first 13 games.
   The longest major-league losing streak at any time during a
season is 23 games, set in 1961 by the Philadelphia Phillies. The
Orioles' 14th straight loss tied the team record for consecutive
losses, set in 1954.
   A crowd of 7,284 watched on a windy night with temperatures in
the 40s.

   The International Air Transport Association
criticized Algeria on Wednesday for freeing the gunmen who hijacked
a Kuwait Airways jetliner and killed two Kuwaiti passengers.
   ``They will have gone back into the mainstream of terrorism, and
we can assume we have not heard the last of them. That is cause for
concern in the airline industry,'' said Rodney Wallis, association
security director.
   ``We now have the possibility that a number of trained hijackers
could lead missions of their own,'' Wallis told The Associated
Press.
   The 15-day-long hijacking ended Wednesday with the release of 31
hostages. Algeria allowed the pro-Iranian hijackers to escape.
   The terrorists, reportedly nine in number, had demanded that
Kuwait release 17 pro-Iranian terrorists convicted and imprisoned
for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait in December
1983.
   Wallis noted that Algeria is not a signatory to the
international convention on hijacking, which calls on authorities
to secure the safe release of passengers, recovery of the aircraft,
and apprehension or extradition of the hijackers.
   Algeria succeeded in the first two parts but not the third.
   ``There was a requirement for all three processes,'' said
Wallis, a former executive at British Airways.
   ``Our worries are now that you've got people who have
experienced the seizure of an aircraft and the holding of hostages
over a lengthy period, and they are now back in circulation.''
   He noted reports that the hijackers told some of their hostages
that the plane seizure was only the first of a series of planned
hijackings.
   The Algerians should have negotiated from strength since the
hijacking had gone for so long and the terrorists must have
realized they could not achieve their goal, he added.
   The International Air Transport Association, a trade association
representing 170 international airlines and headquartered in
Montreal, is investigating how the Kuwaiti aircraft was seized
while it was en route from Bangkok to Kuwait.
   It has asked Thai authorities for permission to send a team to
review security operations at Bangkok airport, Wallis said. ``We
are awaiting a formal response.''
   He said information received by the association indicates
security was lax on the day of the hijacking but there is ``no
definitive conclusion as to where the weapons went on board.
   The association has called for the establishment of an
international court to try hijackers, an international detention
center to jail them, and an international force to negotiate with
hijackers and to mount a rescue attempt if talks fail.

   An off-duty policeman died in surgery of a
gunshot wound Wednesday after the ambulance bypassed the nearest
hospital, which was waiting for him, authorities said.
   Officer Paul Dunbar Jr., 31, was found with a gunshot wound in
his chest in front of a home, said police spokeswoman Allene Ray.
No arrests were made.
   City officials were reviewing telephone and radio contact
between Emergency Medical Service dispatchers and the ambulance
crew that picked up Dunbar to determine why he was not taken to
Henry Ford Hospital a mile away.
   Ford Hospital initially was notified of the shooting and was
prepared to treat Dunbar, but he never arrived, hospital spokesman
Brian Cheatham said.
   Dunbar ended up at Detroit Receiving Hospital, three miles away,
where he died in surgery at 4 a.m., said a secretary in the
hospital's public relations office who declined to give her name.
   Cheatham declined to speculate whether the delay might have cost
the officer his life. ``That's a tough call,'' he said.
   Richard Dolley, assistant chief of the city-owned EMS, referred
questions to Robert Berg, a spokesman for Mayor Coleman A. Young.
Berg did not immediately return telephone calls Thursday.

   Kuwait thanked Algeria for negotiating a
peaceful end to the hijacking of one of its jetliners, but critics
led by the United States said the hijackers should not have been
allowed to go free.
   Kuwait's official news agency KUNA said the nine Shiite Moslem
hijackers _ who had killed two Kuwaiti hostages _ were promised
safe passage to Tehran, Iran or Beirut, Lebanon. It said the gunmen
departed from Algiers shortly after freeing the 31 remaining
hostages in the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 before dawn Wednesday.
   Throughout the ordeal, which began April 5, the hijackers
demanded that the Persian Gulf sheikdom free 17 pro-Iranian
extremists imprisoned for the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French
embassies there.

   Government statistics may be signaling the

   Residents of densely populated coastal states like Connecticut,
New Jersey, Massachussets and California continued to have the
highest average incomes in the nation last year, the Commerce
Department said Wednesday.
   States like Mississippi, West Virginia, Utah and Louisiana that
are dependent on farming, mining or oil were at or near the bottom.
But, Rudolph E. DePass, an analyst with the Commerce Department,
says the figures show growth is accelerating in the Southwest and
Rocky Mountain regions and slowing elsewhere.

   The Senate is likely to join the House in
approving major changes in the nation's welfare system, despite the
near certainty that a presidential veto lies at the end of the long
road to congressional consensus.
   The 25-year drive to overhaul welfare took a significant step
forward Wednesday when the Senate Finance Committee voted 17-3 to
send a comprehensive reform measure to the floor.
   The five-year, $2.8 billion ``Family Security Act'' reflects a
hard-won bipartisan consensus that welfare parents should work to
support their children, that the goverment should help make this
possible and that government aid should be a last resort.

   A volunteer program backed by the
local Roman Catholic Church has been launched to prepare Chileans
for their first election in 15 years and, organizers hope, calm the
country's stormy political waters.
   However, the effort already has stirred up controversy of its
own, drawing fire from backers of the right-wing military
government which charges that it favors the opposition.
   Leaders of the program, called the Crusade for Citizen
Participation, say they hope to recruit 200,000 volunteers across
the country for a door-to-door campaign starting in July. They say
the aim is to promote voter registration and to provide electors
with non-partisan information about their options.

   A minor, everyday stress like public speaking can
be as damaging to the heart as strenuous exercise in people who
have cardiac disease, and even can trigger heart attacks, according
to research published today.
   The researchers found that the common stresses can cause silent
ischemia, a painless but ominous disruption in the flow of blood to
the heart's own muscle.
   The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
shows that ``previously unrecognized mental activities have very
important consequences,'' said Dr. Carl J. Pepine of the University

   For three centuries, language has divided
Canada's two founding cultures. The novelist Hugh MacLennan
prophetically called it the ``Two Solitudes'' of English and French.
   Despite some progress toward bilingualism at a federal level as
promised in the 1982 constitution, language tensions have flared
anew from French-speaking Quebec to the western prairies, where
English is dominant.
   A fluently bilingual Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, about to
start his re-election campaign, has suddenly found himself diverted
into quelling anglophone and francophone unrest.
   Three issues have converged to create the new turmoil:
   _The province of Saskatchewan has repealed an 1886 act requiring
it to issue laws in both English and French. Alberta is expected to
do the same.
   _The Supreme Court is about to rule on Quebec's controversial
ban on English signs. Quebec is 81-percent French but the vocal
English minority in ``la belle province'' claims the ban violates
freedom of speech and is unconstitutional.
   _Mulroney faces opposition from members of his own Progressive
Conservative Party in the west over a proposed new Official
Languages Act that would strengthen bilingualism in federal courts
and institutions.
   ``The populace will be seething and smarting as it pays for
bureaucrats who communicate with one another in a language (French)
which close to four out of five Canadians cannot understand,'' said
Ted Byfield, publisher of Western Report magazine.
   Trying to balance historic sensitivities in Quebec with the need
to keep his base of support in the west, Mulroney told Parliament
that Canada's first prime minister in 1867 had to handle the
linguistic rift ``and I'm sure it will be the case 120 years from
now.''
   ``Language issues will always be there to trouble and upset us
and even to divide us,'' he said.
   At stake for Mulroney is the Meech Lake Accord he negotiated
with all 10 provinces last year, bringing Quebec into the
constitutional fold as a ``distinct society'' and purporting to
protect the rights of linguistic minorities elsewhere.
   Several provinces have balked at ratifying the deal and now
complain that the accord reached at Meech Lake in Quebec rings
hollow when put to the test.
   Premier Robert Bourassa of Quebec came in for particularly harsh
criticism during visits in mid-April to Saskatchewan and Alberta,
neighbors on the prairies.
   He refused to condemn the provinces for not honoring a Feb. 25
Supreme Court decision that said their laws should be issued in
both English and French under an 1886 statute.
   The historic failure to provide laws in French had prompted a
French-speaking priest, the Rev. Andre Mercure, to contest a
Saskatchewan speeding ticket. He died before the case reached the
Supreme Court, but it was a pyrrhic victory for the province's
25,000 francophones since the court suggested that Saskatchewan and
Alberta could repeal the old law and replace it with an
English-only policy.
   That's exactly what Premier Grant Devine of Saskatchewan has
done, arguing that the province cannot afford to re-enact all laws
in French. In the province of just over 1 million people, only
25,000 speak French, and they also speak English.
   Pressed to intervene, Bourassa told reporters: ``I am not a
federal politician. I was not elected to represent Alberta or
Saskatchewan.''
   George Ares, a francophone leader in Saskatchewan, blasted the
premier as ``a traitor'' to the French cause outside Quebec.
   ``He's backpedalling,'' added Aurele Theriault, director of the
Federation of Francophones Outside Quebec (Federation des
francophones hors Quebec).
   Bourassa chose to praise Devine for pledging to translate some
laws into French and permit use of the language in the courts and
Legislature, while setting up language classes for civil servants.
   Mulroney, meanwhile, told Devine that his actions had national
implications and offered federal funds for expanding bilingualism
in the province.
   Bourassa is also under pressure at home, where he pledged in his
1985 election campaign to lift the ban on bilingual signs. But when
an English department store, Zeller's, was firebombed last year
after adding English to its signs, Bourassa retreated for the sake
of what he termed ``social peace.''
   With the Supreme Court ruling on signs pending, federal
Languages Commissioner D'Iberville Fortier stirred the controversy
by accusing the French in Quebec of ``humiliating'' their English
neighbors.
   Royal Orr, president of the English-rights pressure group
Alliance Quebec, maintained that a new language crisis could prompt
the exodus of 100,000 Quebec English speakers, who are a major
economic force in the province.
   ``Frankly, I don't think Quebec can sustain that kind of loss.''
   On another front, Quebec's culture minister, Lise Bacon,
proposed new film distribution laws tightly restricting the number
of English-language movies that can be screened in the province.
   Meanwhile, the government insists that its new Official
Languages Act is merely an attempt to comply with the constitution,
not a means of enforcing compulsory bilingualism in regions where
it's not wanted.
   But opponents claim every federal court and agency will be
required to have bilingual judges and staff, and those unable to
speak French will be bypassed for jobs and promotions.
   ``It's a tragedy,'' said Alex Kindy, a Conservative member of
Parliament from Calgary, Alberta. ``I think Quebec is moving more
and more towards unilingualism and the rest of Canada is going to
be forced to be more and more bilingual.''
   To French-Canadians, whose ancestors arrived in North America
before the British, language preservation is their birthright.
   ``If the rights of francophones had been respected since the
last century, maybe there wouldn't be so few of us now,'' said
Andre Cyr of the Acadian Federation of Nova Scotia, which has about
31,000 French speakers.
   ``Francophones have just as much right to be here as
anglophones. We founded the country too.''
   Ironically, all three major political parties support
bilingualism as do major newspapers. But in the world's second most
spacious country, the language issue falls victim to demographics.
   Of Canada's 25 million people, about 6.2 million speak French.
   But 5.3 million of those live in one province, Quebec, where
French is the sole official language and a majority never speak
English.
   New Brunswick, the province bordering Maine, is one-third French
and the nation's only officially bilingual province. Of Ontario's
9.3 million people, 425,000 are francophones.
   West of Winnipeg in Manitoba, however, not even one in 10 of the
area's 6.7 million people lists French as their native tongue.
   Former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau promoted
bilingualism to defuse the separatist movement in his native
Quebec, and English and French were declared the official federal
languages in 1969. Federal documents are issued in both languages,
government departments have bilingual names, and unilingual civil
servants are paid to take language classes.
   In cities such as Toronto, anglophone parents have enrolled
200,000 children in French immersion schools, the most promising
sign of real change.
   But in most regions, from Newfoundland to British Columbia,
bilingualism has been slow to take root.
   Rene Levesque, the late premier of Quebec, once said French
speakers in the rest of Canada were ``dead ducks'' who would
inevitably lose out to the English majority.

<HEAD>A Little Greek Music From an Irish Cellist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KERIN HOPE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ross Daly was a shaggy-haired Irish
cellist when he left California on a musical journey that followed
the hippy trail to Afghanistan and India.
   Eighteen years later, he's an internationally acclaimed
performer of traditional Middle East music _ the plaintive kind
that Westerners used to call ``weird'' and ``outlandish.''
   ``It wasn't enough, being in London and learning the sitar in a
vacuum,'' the 36-year-old musician said. ``I wanted to find out how
Eastern music really worked. That meant exploring, and it took a
long time.''
   On the road, Daly took lessons from traditional musicians
wherever he could find them _ in workers' cafes or at Moslem
weddings, even at the whirling dervishes' monastery at Konya in
Turkey.
   ``There's a kind of camaraderie among musicians. They'd show me
things, maybe not all the tricks, but enough to get me started on
playing in an authentic way,'' he said.
   Daly performs and composes on a dozen exotic stringed
instruments, from the stubby Turkish ``oud,'' a member of the lute
family, to the resonant Afghan ``rambaba'' and his favorite
old-fashioned Cretan ``lyra.''
   His two latest albums, one solo and another with an
international group he formed and called Lavyrinthos _ the Greek
spelling for ``labyrinth'' _ received first-rate reviews both in
Greece and abroad.
   ``Ross is important for what he does to preserve the Middle East
musical tradition ... and because he doesn't just imitate, he
innovates as well,'' said Lucy Duran, an American musicologist who
heads Britain's National Sound Archive, in an interview.
   A childhood spent in Japan, England and the United States gave
Daly what he said was ``an eclectic approach to music that meant I
wasn't stuck in the Western classical groove.''
   His American music school training was useful for studying the
structure of Oriental music and then dissecting its regional
variations.
   ``We talk about Greek music being different from Turkish, or
Syrian from Egyptian, but in fact they're all part of a common
musical tradition that stretches all the way from Bulgaria to India
and goes back centuries,'' he said.
   That's what Daly and his group _ which includes Turkish,
Armenian, Greek and American musicians _ tries to illustrate in
performances that attract sell-out audiences in Athens clubs and
cultural centers. Their music strips down traditional Oriental
themes to reveal haunting, melancholy melodies or mesmeric rhythms.
   ``We don't use amplifiers and we like to play to no more than a
couple of hundred people. ... That means we can't really be
considered a good commercial proposition for a mass market,'' Daly
said.
   But after a dramatic rise in record sales over the past six
months, Daly is preparing another album and also working on a
documentary feature about traditional east Mediterranean music for
British television.
   His time is split between performances and recording sessions in
Athens, a home on the island of Crete and concert trips to Western
Europe. But he still travels in the Middle East several months a
year to work on his repertoire and add to his collection of several
hundred Oriental instruments.
   Among Greek composers and instrumentalists, who regret the loss
of skilled techniques as the local music-making tradition declines,
Daly is admired for his performing talents as well as his original
work.
   ``He's a tremendously sensitive musician who's developed a deep
feeling for our music. He extracts its essence in his
compositions,'' said composer Manos Hadjidakis, who won an Academy
Award for scoring the film ``Never on Sunday.'' In Crete, Daly
sometimes puts on a traditional black shirt to play the lyra at a
village wedding which may last for 24 hours of feasting, drinking
and dancing.
   He is famed for his ability to extract a rich, melodic tone from
the pear-shaped, toy-size instrument which has three-strings and is
played with a bow.
   ``People think the lyra is a peculiarly Cretan instrument but
I've found it all over Asia Minor and it must have been around
since Byzantine times. I fell for it as soon as I heard it,'' Daly
said.

<HEAD>Tough Pesticide Law Endangered By Lack of Money</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROB WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal program to severely restrict
pesticide use in the forests and farm lands where endangered
species roam may itself be endangered because of a lack of federal
dollars.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency opened a 90-day public
comment period March 9 on a plan to enforce the Endangered Species
Act in areas where pesticide use overlaps with the habitat of
endangered species.
   Remaining hearings are scheduled for April 28 in Kansas City,
Mo., May 3 in Sacramento, and May 6 in Phoenix, Ariz.
   The 1973 Endangered Species Act requires all federal agencies to
ensure their activities or those they monitor do not harm critical
wildlife habitat. The EPA's problem, according to several officials
close to the agency's program, is that it doesn't have the funds to
monitor and enforce pesticide restrictions.
   ``We don't have the money,'' EPA spokesman Al Heier said in a
telephone interview from Washington, D.C. ``We're hoping in the
meantime that where there are endangered species that people would
voluntarily protect them where that's possible.''
   ``Most of the farmers would try to comply,'' said Merlin Fagan
of the California Farm Bureau. ``But if one would look at the
thousands of dollars it could cost, we might be asking a lot.''
   Fagan said the presticide program ``is a joke'' without the
money to monitor pesticide use and verify the presence of
endangered wildlife.
   Jay Feldman of the National Coalition Against the Misuse of
Pesticides contends the EPA is claiming empty coffers to avoid
taking action that would affect farmers.
   ``I think hidden behind the excuse of money is a real reluctance
on the part of the EPA to regulate pesticides that are seen to have
a impact on agricultural production,'' he said. ``It's a lack of
decisive action that plagues the agency, not a lack of resources.''
   One example of an animal's potential impact on agriculture is
the San Joaquin kit fox. This endangered creature roams 340,000
prime acres in Fresno County, an area with crops valued at $58.4
million that could be ruled off-limits to pesticides.
   The push to protect wildlife stems from a 1986 EPA internal
report that slammed the agency for failing to implement the
Endangered Species Act.
   The report included hundreds of complaints filed by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service alleging the EPA had neglected to protect
wildlife where pesticides are used, according to Laurie Mott of the
Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco.
   Asked about the report, Heier said, ``What it said was that we
were not implementing the Endangered Species Act for old
pesticides.''
   The report, coupled with criticism from environmentalists,
prompted the EPA to propose strict regulation, within specific
habitats, of any pesticide registered before 1978, Heier said.
Pesticides registered after 1978, when new rules required more
complete chemical information, comply with the law, he said.
   Angry farmers last fall forced a delay of the program's
scheduled February start because the EPA's maps of rare plants and
animal habitat were inaccurate. Fish and Wildlife Service director
Frank Dunkle wrote last October that enforcing the program based on
bad maps could ``develop a backlash among pesticide users.''
   The EPA plan affects 900 counties nationwide. Pesticide labels
would list specific counties where chemicals could threaten
endangered species. Growers then would obtain a map to determine
restrictions on the chemicals' use.
   Violations of the law can be punishable by fines of up to
$20,000 and one-year prison terms.
   Last year's plan proposed restrictions on:
   _ 24 chemicals for forestry use, affecting 58 plant and animal
species.
   _ 9 mosquito larvacides affecting 78 species.
   _ 29 pesticides for use on rangeland affecting 182 species.
   _ 64 chemicals for croplands affecting 45 species.
   County agricultural commissioners would be a farmer's main
source for chemical restriction information, said James Wells,
chief of the California Food and Agriculture Department's pesticide
enforcement unit.
   As for money to implement and enforce this vast program on the
local level, Wells said, ``That's one of the problems. Nobody in
EPA has said anything about money. In fact, they said there is no
money.''
   Without federal funds, Wells speculated the state of California
would have to absorb the program's cost. The state would have to
help with mapping and enforcement or divert federal funds now used
for other programs.
   Heier said it would probably take two years before the program
gets into full swing.

   When Terence Knox signed on to play Sgt. Zeke
Anderson in CBS' Vietnam war series ``Tour of Duty,'' it sounded
like a dream job _ a starring role in a network show shot on

appreciate it a little bit, at least a Peeping Tom's perspective on
being away from home in a hot place where it rains a lot and where
you don't really see civilians.''
   ``Civilians'' for Knox and the rest of the cast and crew are the
tourists who stay at the same Honolulu hotel. There is no
fraternizing.
   ``People come in waves of like two weeks in Hawaii, so there's
no meaningful relationship to be struck up here,'' joked the young
and single Knox. ``Especially when people are in a zany kind of
get-a-tan-in-two-days mentality. I mean, you can't even seduce
anyone when they're thinking about a suntan.''
   A typical 14-hour shooting day is often spent crawling around in
dusty tunnels or muddy swamps. Sometimes across the island, the CBS
detective series ``Magnum, P.I.'' would be filming, in a decidedly
more genteel atmosphere where series stars don't have to worry
about being killed off in the name of authenticity. Kevin Conroy
was the first casualty among the regulars on ``Tour.''
   ``None of us is immune. I'm glibly sitting here munching french
bread in a restaurant today, but we'll see,'' said Knox, whose job
is presumably safe since he has top billing.
   Knox is deeply dedicated to the series, and frustrated by the
lack of audience. ``Tour'' premiered last fall with a
sophisticated, film-quality style, good writing and fine
performances. But it has not prospered in the ratings.
   It spent most of the season opposite ``The Cosby Show'' on
Thursday night at the unseemly early hour of 8 p.m. Eastern time.
Its ratings improved somewhat in its new Saturday 9 p.m. time
period. CBS executives, who will announce the network's fall
schedule in May, say they remain confident in the show.
   ``I still believe that if you work hard enough at something, it
deserves a shot,'' Knox said. ``You just won't believe how hard
some of that stuff is to do and how dangerous _ nothing compared to
what the real veterans went through. The technical advisers come
out there who are veterans _ without exception before the end of
their episode, they come up and say, `We had no idea you guys
worked this hard.'''
   The way Knox plays him, Sgt. Anderson is a no-nonsense guy who
has re-upped for the second time after finding a kind of success on
the battlefield he couldn't find in civilian life. Anderson has no
interest in politics, he just wants to get his men out alive.
   Veterans groups praised CBS when it announced plans for ``Tour
of Duty'' last year. The response from viewers who are veterans has
been ``overwhelmingly positive,'' Knox said. He said the show gets
a lot of mail from veterans who say they were unable to talk about
their experiences until they saw ``Tour of Duty.''
   ``CBS didn't undertake this show as therapy for anybody,'' Knox
said. ``It was entertainment, going to be quality entertainment,
and it has remained that. But in addition, it has become a great
bringing together of these forces, people who had never talked
about it (the war) before.''
   Before ``Tour,'' Knox's best-known role was Dr. Peter White on
NBC's ``St. Elsewhere,'' a role he thought would be a six-episode
shot. But it developed into one of the most popular subplots on the
critically praised series, when White turned out to be a rapist. He
was later killed off.
   ``It made life hell in the singles bars for awhile,'' Knox said
with a laugh.
   Before ``St. Elsewhere,'' he said, his biggest role was in a
minor film ``starring a $70,000 Mack truck and myself _ and the
truck was better than I was.''

   Driven by a mother's love and a penchant for
publicity, Maria DeSillers defied all tradition of parental
patience and forbearance in the wait for donor organs to try to
save her 7-year-old son, Ronnie.
   One year after her only child's death despite three liver
transplants, Ms. DeSillers still is fighting. But public sentiment
is no longer on her side, and her battle has moved into
Pennsylvania's civil courts and attracted the attention of Florida
legal authorities.
   ``I sit here with pictures all over the walls of my son. I sit
here and I've lost him and I'm fighting for other people's kids and
I'm being criticized,'' Ms. DeSillers said in a telephone interview
from Miami. ``To have people criticize me without knowing all the
facts, it's very painful.''
   With the first anniversary of Ronnie DeSillers' death on Friday,
falling coincidentally within National Organ and Tissue Donor
Awareness Week, she said it hurts even more.
   ``April 29th is going to be a year and it hasn't gotten any
easier for me,'' she said. ``When I see kids playing, I get very
emotional. Everything brings back memories. One thing I keep
hearing over and over is Ronnie saying, `Mommy, I love you with all
my heart.'''
   The 32-year-old former public relations consultant, who is
divorced from Ronnie's father, has withheld $261,189 owed
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, the world's leading liver
transplant center. She alleges her son's third transplanted liver
was defective and that a potential fourth liver was turned down the
day he died.
   The hospital, which stands by its care of the boy, is suing Ms.
DeSillers for the money.
   ``His treatment was beyond criticism. We still don't succeed in
all cases, although we do in the vast majority,'' said Dr. Thomas
E. Starzl, director of transplant surgery at Children's and its
affiliate, Presbyterian-University Hospital. ``We can't match the
anguish a bereaved mother would have. But there's a very real pall
of sadness that settles over us'' when a patient dies. The
controversy surrounding Ronnie's case ``only amplifies the scar''
and ``cheapens'' the boy's memory, Starzl said.
   Hoping to spur a federal investigation of Children's Hospital,
Ms. DeSillers last month released a series of internal memos in
which anesthesiologists criticized the liver transplant program.
   The memos complained of poor communication among doctors,
inadequate review of failed cases and general confusion. One memo
cited a case in which two livers were ``switched about like peas
under shells.'' A member of Pittsburgh's transplant oversight
committee, an advisory group of two general physicians and six
civic leaders, later explained the livers were swapped for medical
reasons and that both operations succeeded.
   In Florida, meanwhile, officials are investigating the way Ms.
DeSillers handled the hundreds of thousands of dollars Ronnie
received from countless Americans, including President Reagan, a
fund that provided the initial $163,113 payment to the hospital.
   A state audit this year put the total amount Ms. DeSillers
deposited in seven accounts at two Florida banks at $980,310, a
figure Ms. DeSillers says is far too high.
   The money poured in after $4,000 collected by Ronnie's
classmates was reported stolen in February 1987, a burglary still
under investigation by Fort Lauderdale police.
   Even after arriving at Children's with her increasingly ill son,
Ms. DeSillers championed his cause like few parents before. On
television shows and in frequent calls to reporters, she also
stressed the need for organ donation and spoke out on behalf of
others awaiting transplants.
   By the time Ronnie died, the single bank account in his name had
accumulated $509,913, according to Fred Kerstein, chief of the
economic crimes division in the Office of the State Attorney in
Miami. As of mid-February, the balance was $239,288, he said.
   Those assets were frozen last month by a Dade County judge who
appointed a curator for the estate.
   Kerstein says Ms. DeSillers spent at least $47,000 of the
missing money on jewelry, clothes, furniture, a BMW automobile and
a Biscayne Bay apartment. He declined to break down that figure or
elaborate on additional expenditures because of his office's
investigation into possible fraud and other criminal violations.
   Ms. DeSillers says she never squandered any of the donations and
gave as much as $175,000 to families of transplant patients.
   She says she bought her 1984 BMW at an auction for $13,000 and
her one-bedroom apartment doubles as her office, which she
furnished with a computer and other equipment. The apartment rents
for $850 a month, but she says her one-year lease includes three
free months.
   Some of her own money was deposited with the donations, she
says, and she used it to buy back jewelry she had pawned to pay
medical bills. She says she also used some of the money to repay
loans she took out to get Ronnie to Pittsburgh.
   ``People don't realize I was not an accountant and I was not an
attorney and I did not have guidebooks,'' she said.
   Ms. DeSillers is appealing a $1,000 fine for violating Florida's
Solicitation of Charitable Contributions Act, which mandates that
solicitations for single individuals go solely to the beneficiary.
She maintains she never asked for donations, but received them
through sympathetic news accounts.
   Reacting to the furor, a Florida Senate committee approved a
bill on April 20 to more strictly regulate charitable contributions.
   Ms. DeSillers has also been criticized for paying herself $300 a
week as president of the Ronnie DeSillers National Foundation. ``I
was working 17 hours a day,'' she said in her defense.
   The doubts and bitterness raised by the DeSillers case have
hardly been a boon to organ donation.
   ``It has made people even more suspicious of the transplant
field in terms of fairness and equity, and I think therefore it has
had a dangerous effect on the willingness of people to be organ
donors,'' said Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical
Ethics at the University of Minnesota.
   On the other hand, Caplan said, ``the case highlights the
inadequacy of the way in which we fund innovation and progress in
medical research. ... Families shouldn't need to beg for money or
depend on charity.''
   The DeSillers case has also made fund raising more difficult,
according to Mary Ann Lunde, chairman of the National Organ
Transplant Education Foundation in Fort Lauderdale.
   ``It's sort of heart-breaking when you think about how this
community (south Florida) responded to Ronnie DeSillers' needs .. .
and now it's having the opposite, negative impact,'' Mrs. Lunde
said.
   Ms. DeSillers is chronicling her and Ronnie's struggle in a book
she began writing four months ago. She says it includes
``everything that happened in the hospital: names, dates,
circumstances.''
   ``I know there's a reason for everything that happens and I know
in the end, out of the ashes, comes the phoenix,'' she said. ``I
know in the end, it will be for the good of other children that
Ronnie died.''

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>

   The scenery is magnificent: the snow-capped
Elburz mountains rising majestically outside the capital.
   But cynical residents say the credit for that belongs to Saddam
Hussein, the president of Iraq, which has been at war with Iran
since 1980.
   In normal times, the Elburz mountains are often obscured by a
curtain of smog.
   But since the ``Missile War of the Cities'' prompted a mass
exodus from Tehran, pollution has radically declined.
   ``Hussein could become minister of the environment'' was the
ironic comment of an Iranian interpreter who accompanied a Western
press group on a recent visit to Iran.
   About half of Tehran's 6 million perople _ by private estimates
8 million plus _ are believed to have left the city after it became
the target of long-range Iraqi missiles.
   Many who stayed are frightened.
   In the hope that reinforced concrete will offer protection
against the missiles, the wealthy have packed the major hotels,
paying a room rate of 6,100 rials a night. That is $91.50 at the
official exchange rate and is more than one tenth of a worker's
average monthly salary.
   Some low-income families have moved into improvised air raid
shelters, often underground parking lots, taking along carpets and
other personal belongings. Anyone who loots an empty apartment
faces an ancient punishment _ the right hand is cut off.
   The Iraqi missile attacks have already claimed more than 1,000
civilian lives in Tehran, chiefly in the poorer quarters. Fears of
a further escalation have mounted since Iraq's gas attack at
Halabja, a Kurdish town in northeastern Iraq, after it was captured
in an Iranian offensive in March.
   Iran claims that 5,000 civilians were killed and 7,000 injured
in the attack.
   Iraq recently acknowledged for the first time that it has been
using chemical weapons barred by 1925 Geneva protocols. Its claim
that Iran is also using them has been emphatically denied by Tehran
and diplomatic sources here say they have no reason to question
that denial.
   How long will the war continue?
   Iran has said it will accept a cease-fire only if Iraq is
formally identified as the aggressor by the international community
and is punished. It demands the ouster of Hussein as Iraq's
president and several hundred billion dollars in reparations.
   An Iranian businessman who spent several years in the West said
most people are tired of the war but generally fail to understand
why the United Nations cannot rule it was Iraq that started it.
   ``That would be the first step to a solution,'' he said.
   But Iraq refuses to accept the blame, and the matter remains in
dispute.
   ``We will fight until final victory,'' a crowd chanted during
one recent Friday prayer service on the Tehran University campus.
   Iran, with a population estimated at 46.6 million, three times
that of Iraq, has an inferior arsenal and airpower. It has already
paid a heavy toll. By the end of 1986, the number of dead or
wounded was estimated by the Stockholm Peace Research Institute at
750,000. It said the actual figure may be much higher.
   The economic costs of the war are staggering, chiefly because
Iraqi air attacks have slashed oil revenues and refinery
capacities. In 1986, according to the local press, Iran had to
spend $1.5 billion of scarce foreign exchange to pay for imports
that otherwise would have been covered by oil exports. This was
more than twice the total of revenues from non-oil exports, led by
Persian rugs.
   Coping with runaway inflation has become a daily chore for the
average Iranian.
   Basic food is rationed and most is still relatively inexpensive.
The price of a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of bread is the rial
equivalent of 60 cents at the official conversion rate, but a
kilogram of rationed meat is $10.50. A worker making the equivalent
of $600 a month has to moonlight to support a family.
   The prices of non-essential items are soaring. They range from
$330 for a toy F-14 Tomcat fighter plane made in Taiwan _ with U.S.
military markings _ and $360 for a pair of Turkish-made blue jeans
to $19,500 for a 13-year-old Paykan car, with a British-made
Hillman engine and an unspecified number of miles on it.
   Quite a few Iranians apparently can still easily afford such
prices and even greater luxuries, however.

<TEXT>
   Private wealth has been widely left untouched by Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic revolution and free enterprise is
encouraged by the Koran, the Islamic holy book. The black market
has become so much a part of the economy that the ``free'' exchange
rates are regularly quoted by the national news agency, IRNA.
   And although the United States remains the ``Great Satan,'' the
U.S. dollar is the preferred currency and at the free-exchange rate
one dollar fetches 1,165 rials, 17 times the official rate.
   ``I know of a woman who still flies to Paris every spring to buy
a new collection of clothes, spending perhaps $15,000 or more,''
said one European resident at a dinner party replete with whiskey,
rock music and dancing _ all forbidden _ in Shemiram, the elegant
section in northern Tehran.
   Shemiram has been spared by Iraqi missiles so far. But even
there, some villas and apartments are empty because their owners
have fled to Caspian Sea resorts or the Elburz mountains, where
Islamic rules require men and women to ski on separate trails.
   The Shemiram section also includes the residence of the
86-year-old Khomeini, who looks in relatively good shape, according
to diplomats who recently saw him at his mosque.
   Growing popular discontent with the unequal sharing of the war's
financial burdens may have been at a root of his recent Fatwa, or
binding religious guideline, that strengthened the hands of the
government.
   Up to now, key economic reforms have been blocked on religious
grounds by the Council for the Protection of the Constitution, a
watchdog body dominated by Islamic fundamentalists.
   Tax collection has been sluggish. Deputy Finance Minister Ali
Majedi said recently taxation capacity was twice that currently
collected. A Western diplomat termed his estimate a gross
understatement.
   ``God knows that even the filthy capitalist system in the West
is not like that,'' a legislator, Sahed Ali Akbar Tahaili, recently
complained in the Majlis, the 270-seat parliament. He was referring
to a huge tax debt run up by one of the various foundations
controlled by religious authorities.
   ``When someone moves to another state in the United States, all
his records are checked to make sure he has paid all his taxes,''
the legislator added.
   The new parliament formed after the April 8 general elections is
widely predicted to step up pressure for reforms, with the position
of its pragmatist speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, strengthened further.
   Reformers may face an uphill battle. Official figures cited by
the newspaper Etela'at suggest that black market trends are
determined by speculative money worth tens of billions of dollars.
   There is little doubt, however, that the role of the mullahs,
the religious dignitaries, will be reduced by Khomeini's Fatwa. The
Fatwa says the government may even prevent Hadj, the annual Moslem
pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, if the national interests
demand a temporary suspension.
   Iranians already have noticed a certain relaxation in the
enforcement of religious laws. Women wearing make-up or nail polish
or who let part of their hair peek out from under a headdress are
normally no longer stopped on the street by the Pasdaran, the
revolutionary guards.
   But the chador, the all-encompassing outer garment, remains a
must for women, even when skiing.
   ``When they come downhill, they look like bats,'' said the wife
of a European ambassador.

<HEAD>Exhibit of Ancient Egypt's Last Great Pharaoh To Open In Boston</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Generations of workers and slaves transported
granite blocks 600 miles down the Nile River to erect the 57-ton
Colossus of Memphis.
   Nearly 3,200 years later, sophisticated engineers at Boston's
Museum of Science were perplexed about how they would handle the
giant statue honoring Ramses II, the last great Pharaoh of Egypt
and the empire's most prolific builder.
   While preparing for an exhibit of artifacts from his 66-year
reign, engineers grappled with methods to bring the 27-foot
structure into the museum. Proposals to demolish a wall or cut a
hole in the roof were deemed infeasible and too costly.
   ``So we decided to put it outside,'' said Mary Dussault, a
project coordinator for the ``Ramesses the Great'' exhibit, which
opens April 30 and runs for four months. ``I have to say it looks
pretty majestic.''
   Exhibit directors use the preferred translation of the Pharaoh's
name _ Ramesses _ instead of the more accepted anglicized version,
Ramses.
   The giant statue depicts Ramses wearing the cone-shaped crown of
upper Egypt royalty and a pleated skirt. Jewels adorn his neck and
wrist, as he strides forward, left foot first.
   The colossus was uncovered by crews digging the foundation for a
building in 1962 near Memphis, Egypt. It was broken into three
large pieces and many fragments. About 30 workers began to
reassemble the statue in 1985, doing the reconstruction in the area
where it had been discovered.
   The Colossus of Memphis will stand outside the museum, encased
in a 40-foot wood and steel structure resembling an ancient
Egyptian temple. The monument is the centerpiece of the 72-piece
exhibit, the largest collection of antiquities from Egypt's Golden
Age ever on display in North America.
   The Ramses show is larger than the 55 artifacts seen by more
than 8 million people in the Tutankhanum exhibit, which toured the
United States and Canada in the late 1970s and generated more than
$50 million.
   Priceless antiquities from the reign of Ramses the Great were
first seen in North America in October 1985 at Brigham Young
University. That show went on to be displayed at the World's Fair
in Vancouver, British Columbia, Jacksonville, Fla., and Memphis,
Tenn.
   The three sections of the colossus and dozens of crates
containing other artifacts from Cairo's Egyptian Museum arrived in
Boston last week from Denver.
   The exhibit, insured by Lloyds of London for $40 million, was
designed to depict the grandeur as well as the simplicity of life
under Ramses. Ornate jewelry, including a 19-pound gold necklace
with braided collar and 14 tassels, are displayed along with such
prosaic items as a cosmetic case, a bronze razor and senet, a board
game popular at the time.
   There's also the lid from the mummy coffin that contained
Ramses' remains; the elaborate burial chamber of Sannedjem, a
respected painter and artisan; and several statues of baboons from
the temple at Abu Simbel.
   Ramses left a rich legacy of monuments and buildings, including
his mortuary temple at Thebes, the temple of Abu Simbel in Nubia,
two obelisks in front of the Temple at Luxor, his palace city at
Zoan in the Delta and the Temple at Karnak with the largest columns
in the world _ they measure roughly 11 feet in diameter.
   Architects still marvel at the precision of Abu Simbel, where
sunlight streams 160 feet into the temple on certain days to
illuminate an inner chamber.
   Ramses, reported to have sired 90 children, waged a long and
successful battle against the Hittites of Palestine and is believed
by some biblical scholars to be the Pharaoh of the Book of Exodus.
   Like his prodigious family and his mammoth projects, tales of
his life ring on a grand scale. Ancient records say Ramses claimed
his birth was signaled by the emergence of the star Sirius on the
same day as Egyptians' began their religious and civil new years, a
convergence which occurs once every 1,461 years.
   He ruled from 1279-1213 B.C. No one is quite sure when he was
born, but he was in his 80s when he died. Ramses I, his grandfather
who founded the 19th dynasty after Akhnaton and Tutankhamen, ruled
for one year. Seti I, Ramses' father, waged war against Libyans and
Hittites and extended the boundaries of the Egyptian empire. Ramses
continued war against the Hittites _ an ancient people of Asia
Minor and Syria _ in Palestine.
   The Battle of Kadesh was one of the last battles with the
Hittites. Ramses II later signed a peace treaty with the Hittites.
   Although Ramses' mummy remains in Cairo, the Boston exhibit will
feature Padihershef, a 2,500-year-old mummy owned by Massachusetts
General Hospital.
   Last month, Padihershef, a stonecutter, was transported from the
hospital in a plastic bubble stretcher designed for victims of
nuclear accidents.
   Jan Crocker, director of traveling exhibits at the museum, said
negotiations to bring the exhibit to Boston were launched several
years ago by museum director Roger Nichols, who died in December.
   After the Ramses exhibit returns to Egypt, the colossus will
remain in Memphis, Tenn., for six more months.
   Each city sponsoring the exhibit guarantees a minimum $400,000
payment to the Egyptian government to help construct a new national
museum.

   This town is also a different town: those porches and fences are
mandated, and lawns, artificial siding and attached garages are
forbidden.
   Seaside, pop. 203, is a small resort with a big ambition _ to
revive a style of civic intimacy out of fashion since America moved
to the suburbs.
   By bringing homes, offices, stores and play areas closer
together, Seaside's tight grid of streets, paths and squares is
designed to get people out of their cars and in touch.
   If this sounds familiar, it is.
   ``The newest idea in planning is the 19th century town,'' says
architect Andres Duany, whose firm designed Seaside's master plan
and wrote its building code. ``Seaside is the only authentic
American town to be built in the last 40 years.''
   It's also one of the most celebrated. The Boston Globe's Robert
Campbell, part of the pack of critics, designers and developers who
have made the pilgrimage to the Florida panhandle, calls Seaside
``perhaps the most important new piece of architecture in the
country.''
   ``Seaside has no enemies,'' gloats Duany. ``It's the old
American way of doing things.'' And he says that because the town
plan and building code can be adjusted for any town, ``it's going
to be the model for the new suburb.''
   At the moment, however, Seaside is at least a decade from
completion. Less than a third of its 300 planned houses have been
built, and the spaces set aside for a school, church, inn and
meeting hall are empty. The town square is a muddy lot. Because it
has few year-round residents, Seaside is virtually deserted in
winter.
   Although Seaside is designed to limit dependence on the
automobile, there is little within walking distance besides a
restaurant, a snack bar, a book store, a boutique and a one-room
post office that houses the five-shelf public library.
   What has been built is charming: the pastel wooden cottages
range in style from neo-Victorian to plain old Florida cracker, but
feel like parts of a whole; the skyline is enlivened by towers,
widow's walks and pitched roofs, all encouraged by the code; the
landscaping _ indigenous sand and scrub _ is natural.
   There are many nice details, such as a trellis-shaded chess
board, a gazebo in an intersection, a balcony over the front door
of the Department of Public Works shed. Sandy footpaths offer
shortcuts between back yards. Houses bear signs with residents'
names, instead of numbers.
   This is how Robert Davis dreamed it would be.
   Davis, a 44-year-old Birmingham, Ala., native, had visited this
area as a boy, building castles in the white sand along the Gulf of
Mexico.
   In 1978, when he inherited 80 acres here, Davis wanted to build
again. But he was revolted by the cold condominium towers sprouting
along the water.
   He drove around the Southeast, visiting gracious old towns.
Equipped with tape measure, notebook and camera, he recorded street
widths, building dimensions, architectural types.
   The result is Seaside.
   ``This is not an artistic endeavor,'' says Duany, who
accompanied Davis on some of the trips. ``What we've done has
nothing to do with inspiration. We know how to design because we've
studied cities and towns that work.''
   American town planning and design traditions ``seem so dumb and
simple,'' marvels Davis. ``Why would we ever have gotten away from
them?''
   Cheap cars, cheap gas and cheap land allowed those who
engineered the post-World War II building boom to separate home,
market and workplace as never before.
   Lessons learned by previous generations _ such as the proper
ratio of a street's width to the height of its buildings, or how
far an adult with a child will walk to a store _ seemed irrelevant.
   Duany complains that today's suburbanites must drive to buy a
loaf of bread, play tennis, visit a friend, ``even to walk the
dog.'' If they do step out front, their wide, meandering streets,
many without sidewalks, afford an inhospitable meeting place.
   As a result, few residents stop to discuss the weather, drink
coffee, gossip. If people do not talk, Davis and Duany believe,
culture cannot flourish.
   In its master plan and building code, Seaside looks to a more
amiable past; it seeks not only to look like an old town, but to
work like one.

   Like a traditional Southern town, Seaside's design includes
commercial buildings with sidewalk arcades and offices and
apartments on the upper floors; on-street parking, but only one
small parking lot; and straight, tree-lined boulevards that connect
public places.
   Houses are required to have a front porch 16 feet from the
street, to encourage conversation between porch sitters and
pedestrians. Each front yard must have a fence, and it must be
different from the others on the street. Garages must be in back,
out of sight.
   The lines of fences and houses produce intimate, visually
stimulating streets that feel like outdoor rooms. ``Human beings
are programmed to feel space,'' Duany says. ``In the wrong kind of
space, you feel, `What am I doing here?'''
   ``Look at Georgetown,'' in Washington, D.C. ``People pay
incredible prices for substandard plumbing, small rooms and parking
three blocks away _ just to live on a nice street.''
   When the weather is good, Seaside's residents stroll around,
looking at new houses, chatting and generally enjoying themselves.
Motorists don't speed because the streets are narrow, slightly
bumpy, lined with parked cars and filled with pedestrians.
   ``You can't help but meet people,'' says Jim Koronkiewicz, an
accountant from Long Island whose family vacations at Seaside. ``It
brings out the best in you.''
   The ultimate evidence of Seaside's success is financial. The
cost of an typical 50-by-100-foot lot has risen from $20,000 six
years ago to around $70,000 today _ twice as much as a lot the same
size elsewhere along the coast.
   But Seaside is not perfect. In the heat of summer, for instance,
most residents seem to prefer the comfort of an air-conditioned
living room to the more social climate on the porch.
   And back yard cottages and upstairs apartments, forbidden in
most new communities but encouraged by Seaside's building code,
have become too expensive for the kinds of people supposed to live
in them, such as domestics and students.
   This lack of a socio-economic mix, says Duany, is ``the one
signal failure of Seaside. It's a rich person's town.''
   That leads some to wonder if this seasonal, affluent resort _
still more theory than reality _ is an appropriate model for the
new American suburb.
   Duany and Davis have no doubt that Seaside, or at least its
master plan and building code, can be transplanted. Even large
communities should be broken down into small village clusters, they
say.
   ``We're preaching to developers and architects that the same
elements that go into suburbs can be reformulated into fairly dense
little towns,'' Davis says.
   Duany and his wife and partner, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, have
fashioned a model ordinance designed to create a Seaside-like
``Traditional Neighborhood District'' wherever it is adopted. ``We
just mail it out,'' he says. ``If you want to make an impact in
this country, you have to kick into mass production.''
   But Americans seem to love the privacy and comfort of their cars
and suburbs. Given what Columbia University historian Kenneth
Jackson calls ``a national distrust of urban life and communal
living,'' do they really want to get closer to each other?
   ``After generations of increasing privatization, Americans are
starved for public life,'' Davis insists. ``When you step outside
your house you want to see people. It's scary for our culture that
we've stopped seeing each other on the street.''

   For 20 years Leon Krier has talked
architecture, taught architecture, delineated architecture,
designed architecture. Everything but built architecture.
   ``I do not build because I am an architect,'' he once wrote,
meaning he would not compromise his principles and build in a world
being rendered uninhabitable by industrialization, technology and
modern architecture.
   When his plan for a school in France came in 200 percent over
budget, Krier gave up the commission rather than change his design.
   But now this consummate purist is building _ a wood cottage for
vacation time in this new Florida panhandle resort.
   ``He finally took a deep breath and plunged into the abyss,''
says Robert Davis, Seaside's developer. ``I'm honored he's willing
to make an exception for Seaside.''
   ``Seaside comes along at just the right moment,'' Krier, a
Luxembourg native, said in a telephone interview from his home in
London. ``There's nothing new like it.''
   As far as Krier is concerned, all the problems of architecture
were solved before the Industrial Revolution; modern architecture
and technology have served mainly to ruin the world's cities.
   Seaside, on the other hand, reflects his preference for small
settlements, human scale, pedestrian activity and traditional
buildings.
   Although Krier has no track record, ``his plans have been
influential far beyond their unexecuted state for the way in which
they have re-established a lost vision'' of a romantic past,
according to architectural critic Ada Louise Huxtable.
   Krier also is a bit of a gadfly. At an architects' conference
three years ago, Krier pointedly questioned Philip Johnson, dean of
American architects, about a skyscraper he'd designed in Boston.
   The building, Johnson admitted, was ``2 million square feet of
space that should not be in this part of Boston.'' Implicitly
acknowledging Krier's purity, he added, ``I am a whore and I am
paid very well for high-rise buildings.''
   In return for helping to lay out Seaside's plan and design the
town tower, Davis gave Krier a building lot. But he attached one
condition: Krier had to build on it.
   The three-room cottage, designed to resemble a classical temple,
should be ready this summer.
   Krier wants to see how it turns out before completing his design
for the tower. After years of designing on paper, he joked, ``I
want to see how many mistakes I've made.''

   Maturing baby boomers are changing the rules for
menswear as they look for clothes somewhere between jeans and
T-shirt and the pinstripe suit.
   ``Most of the younger guys who are working grew up on MTV and
rock 'n' roll,'' said award-winning designer Bill Robinson, whose
label is starting its third year.
   This generation, he says, is ``breaking down barriers of how and
where you wear things.''
   The experimentation is evident in clothes now being shown for
fall, soon to be sent to stores across the country.
   The look includes round, softer shoulders on sportcoats;
high-waisted sweaters meant to be tucked in; mock turtlenecks to be
worn under vests; buttery ``antique leathers'' and suedes. Browns,
grays and blacks are popular, but some designers are throwing in
reds, yellows and what one called ``vegetable colors.''
   ``I think men are ready to wear color,'' said Ronaldus Shamask,
a relative newcomer to menswear whose minimalistic designs in such
shades as mustard, teal and wine have won acclaim. ``Men are
becoming much more comfortable with experimenting.''
   The classic Polo line by Ralph Lauren, who's been designing
menswear for more than 20 years, is trying out American Indian
styles, suede shirts and ``antique ski and expedition clothing.''
   Even the business suit is ``loosening up,'' said Tom Julian,
associate fashion director of the Men's Fashion Association. ``Men
are more aware (of fashion) today.''
   Jack Herschlag, executive director of the National Association
of Men's Sportswear Buyers, says suits are appearing in a variety
of silhouettes this fall and even the double-breasted suit will
attempt a comeback.
   Men are moving away from the investment-dressing era and into a
stage of experimentation, Herschlag says.
   He and others in the field attribute the development partly to
the influence of movies and TV shows like ``thirtysomething'' and
``L.A. Law'' that feature smartly dressed young professionals.
   Business is helped when men see role models like Bill Cosby
``looking groovy'' on TV, says Robinson, who describes his clothes
as souped-up versions of American classics.
   ``It's not silly; it's not meant to make a statement,'' insisted
Shamask's sales director, Harlan Bratcher. ``It's more for people
who are tired of playing games. It's more: `This is me.'''
   That's not to say the new looks are for everyone.
   Those who are sticking with jeans should know that this fall
marks the beginning of the ``post-acidwashed era,'' Herschlag said.
   ``The pendulum is swinging back to very, very dark colors,''
said Julian.
   And the conservative business suit is not dead yet.
   ``There'll always be a Brooks Brothers element in the society,''
Robinson said.

   Rising consumer prices are contributing to worries in the
financial markets that inflation is accelerating.
   The government said Wednesday that consumer prices jumped 0.5
percent in March, reflecting a record increase in clothing costs
and higher food and gasoline prices that triggered the biggest
inflation jump in 14 months.
   Analysts said the sharp increase in the Labor Department's
Consumer Price Index, which translated into a 6.4 percent annual
growth rate, demonstrated that the weak dollar and unexpectedly
strong consumer demand were threatening to ignite a new bout of
spiraling costs.
   They speculated those pressures soon would prompt the Federal
Reserve to nudge interest rates higher.
   The bond market, a good indicator of inflation sentiment,
reacted negatively to the CPI report. Bond prices fell and the
yield on the Treasury's key 30-year bond rose to 9.05 percent,
although prices later recovered somewhat.
   Stocks also fell Wednesday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial
average down 14.09 points to 1,985.41, its third straight decline.
   The financial markets first were jolted last week when an
unexpectedly high U.S. trade deficit for February sent the dollar
plunging. A government report that wholesale prices jumped in March
intensified investor worries.
   The Reagan administration, which is counting on the Federal
Reserve to keep the economy growing through the November election,
contended Wednesday that the inflation fears were overblown.
   ``Despite large increases for consumer and producer prices in
March, the smaller increases in prices in previous
months...indicate that inflation remains under control,'' said
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Some private economists disputed that view.
   ``The CPI rise reflects an increasingly widespread inflationary
environment,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
``The good news on inflation is over for this year and the question
now really is `how high will prices go?'''
   The March CPI increase followed a modest 0.2 percent February
rise and was the biggest monthly gain since a 0.7 percent increase
in January 1987.
   In another economic report, the Labor Deparment said Americans'
average weekly earnings, after discounting for inflation, fell 0.3
percent in March, the second consecutive monthly decline. The
changes left Americans' inflation-adjusted earnings 1.2 percent
below a year ago.

   Profit-taking and quiet days in the Persian Gulf
following Monday's combat have helped sustain a slide in oil
futures prices.
   At the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for May delivery
of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled at
$17.74 per barrel on Wednesday, down 29 cents from Tuesday, when
they fell 49 cents.
   Among refined products, May contracts for wholesale unleaded
gasoline ended at 51.42 cents per gallon, down 0.72 cent, while
wholesale heating oil contracts closed at 49.31 cents per gallon,
off 0.37 cent.
   Madison Galbraith, senior energy specialist at Merrill Lynch
Energy Futures, said the selling that began late Monday continued
as no reports of renewed hostilities emerged from the Persian Gulf.
   Prices surged early Monday amid reports that U.S. Navy vessels
had destroyed two offshore Iranian oil platforms, sunk an Iranian
patrol boat and bombed two Iranian navy frigates while Iran had
fired on at least two U.S. vessels.
   Traders often fear that fighting in the area might hamper oil
shipments, which could tend to drive prices higher. But because
producers outside the area widely are expected to cover any
shortfall, the combat-induced rally was short-lived.
   Prices began dropping late Monday and continued falling on
Tuesday and Wednesday as traders cashed in gains made during
Monday's climb.
   Some of the selling also was due to technical factors, Galbreath
said.

<TEXT>
   Japan's economy is riding one of its biggest booms
of the past five years, surprising many economists who just last
year were predicting a recession.
   Economists say the boom _ fueled by low interest rates, tax cuts
and massive public spending _ will continue for at least two years.
   Further into the future, they say, annual growth in the gross
national product likely will exceed the government's 3.75 percent
forecast for the next five years.
   ``The speed of Japan's recovery has surprised most commentators.
This is really a remarkable pace,'' said Rich Jerran, an economist
for the Kleinwort Benson investment firm. ``The domestic economy is
roaring.''
   During the past 11 months, manufacturing output shot up 14
percent, a figure that took twice as long to achieve during the
boom years of the 1970s, economists say.
   Government officials report that corporate profits rose 27.2
percent during 1987, while household savings rose by 11.8 percent.
   Inflation-adjusted consumer spending rose a near record 5.8
percent in February alone, second only to a 5.9 percent rise
recorded in November 1975.
   According to the investment firm Merrill Lynch, sustaining the
current economic pace over the rest of 1988 would mean gross
national product growth of 5 percent, corporate profit growth of
about 18 percent and retail sales growth of 13.8 percent.
   William P. Sterling, senior economist for Merrill Lynch in
Tokyo, said Japan's 1987 growth alone could keep the economic boom
rolling for the rest of this year _ making it a fertile market for
the United States and other nations wanting to boost their exports.
   A drop in Japanese exports because of the rising yen _ which
makes Japanese products more expensive overseas _ cooled the
economy somewhat last year, but exports affect only 17 percent of
Japan's GNP, Sterling said.
   ``The other 83 percent is not exports, and that did very well,''
he said.
   Sterling said the current boom is the best of the past four or
five years, although the officially projected GNP growth rate of
3.75 percent is low compared to the 8 percent to 10 percent a year
Japan achieved during the 1960s and part of the 1970s.
   Just last May, economists were saying Japan was headed for an
economic downturn, with the yen's rapid rise inflating prices for
the nation's export-driven economy.
   Industrial production fell to its lowest rate in years, and
unemployment rose to a record 3.2 percent. Japan's unemployment
rate is artificially low, because it counts as employed members of
the armed forces and people who work more than one hour during the
last week of the month.
   ``There was a lot of pressure to stop the yen from going up'' in
1986, Jerran said. ``Japan achieved this by cutting interest rates,
fueling a domestic housing boom that contributed about one-third of
the GNP growth.''
   Jerran said the government also injected $48 billion into the
economy through public works spending and tax cuts.
   At a news conference on Tuesday, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi
Sumita said he was pleased with the economy's performance and said
one of his biggest concerns is maintaining stability.
   Sumita said that without a sudden appreciation in the yen or a
rapid rise in prices, economic growth was unlikely to slow.
   Although the United States will benefit somewhat from Japan's
prosperity, Sterling said the effect would not be that great.
Although U.S. exports rose by 55.8 percent last month from a year
earlier, exports to Japan still accounted for less than 1 percent
of gross national product.
   ``The United States needs to export not only to Japan but
everywhere else to get out of the problems it is in now,'' he said.
   One downside to the Japanese economy might be in housing starts
and the relative prosperity Japan has enjoyed for the past year:
things have been so good, economists say, there is bound to be a
slowdown.
   The cost of housing has reached the point where it takes eight
years of a worker's gross income to purchase a small condominium,
which costs about $500,000. Four years is considered normal in most
other countries.
   Jerran also says there is a danger of the Japanese economy
overheating.
   ``Because of the rapid rise over the past year, industry is
running out of capacity and labor,'' he said. ``This raises the
danger that prices will climb upwards.''
   In turn, the Bank of Japan may decide to push interest rates
higher _ possibly by this summer _ to help curb inflation, he said.

<HEAD>Aeromexico Strike and Bankruptcy Raises Tourism Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAVIER PICHARDINI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prospects for a banner year in Mexico's
crucial tourism industry may have been grounded by the bankruptcy
of the government's Aeromexico airline.
   A federal judge declared Aeromexico bankrupt on Monday and
ordered it into receivership, leaving its more than 9,200 workers
jobless. The airline already had canceled most of its flights
because of a strike triggered by Aeromexico's plans for a
cost-cutting restructuring.
   ``The disappearance of Aeromexico will affect negatively the
tourism sector and will hinder (it) from reaching the estimates of
transportation of foreign visitors to the different national
destinations,'' Tourism Secretary Antonio Enriquez Savignac told
reporters Tuesday night.
   Tourism vies with the ``maquiladora'' assembly plant industry _
in which foreign companies set up factories in Mexico to take
advantage of cheap labor _ _ as the nation's No. 2 source of
foreign exchange after petroleum.
   Estimates had been that tourism would bring in as much as $2.4
billion this year, the highest since 1982, when the peso's drop in
value against the dollar started a slide in tourism revenue.
   Aeromexico filed for bankruptcy after ground and technical
workers went on strike April 12 in protest of management plans to
reduce the fleet and route system to bring the money-losing airline
into the black.
   Enriquez Savignac said Aeromexico and Mexicana, the other
state-run airline which is unaffected by the bankruptcy or strike,
carry 57 percent of the foreign tourists arriving by air.
   Aeromexico was the only carrier serving 15 Mexican cities.
   Representatives of the Aeromexico Technicians and Workers Union,
which represents 7,250 striking workers, announced plans to seek a
meeting with President Miguel de la Madrid.
   ``We will ask the president for a restructuring of the
company,'' Miguel Angel Mejorada, the union's secretary for
internal matters, said in a phone interview.
   He said the union still had not received formal notification of
the judge's bankruptcy decision, which had been announced by the
federal Communications and Transportation Department.
   The airline's 2,000 pilots and cabin attendants have their own
unions that did not support the strike, which forced cancellation
of all 223 daily flights to 42 domestic and international
destinations.
   The union has charged that the decision to seek bankruptcy was
politically motivated and not made on economic grounds.
   No plans have been announced for a replacement for Aeromexico.
Mexicana on Tuesday started accepting Aeromexico tickets for routes
in which they operated with parallel service.
   Aeromexico started business in 1934 and has been owned by the
government since 1957. Mexicana has been controlled by the
government since 1982.

<HEAD>Imprisoned Wall Street Felon's Lawyers Seek Reduced Sentence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ivan F. Boesky's help in exposing other Wall
Street felons is more significant than previously recognized and
could spark new indictments by fall, his lawyers have indicated in
a request to cut the convicted speculator's prison sentence.
   In seeking to reduce the three-year term, lawyers Leon Silverman
and Robert McCaw also disclosed that federal officials physically
protected Boesky from a death threat before he began serving his
sentence last month.
   They also claim Boesky has been tailed and harassed by others _
sometimes using telephone-equipped cars _ he has implicated in
financial felonies.
   ``Mr. Boesky has been asked, and has volunteered, information
about topics, people, relationships, transactions and securities
that were not the subject of pre-sentence debriefing sessions,''
the document states. ``He has suggested new avenues of inquiry for
government investigators.''
   The document, filed with U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker last
Friday and made available by his office Wednesday, marked one of
the clearest public indications yet that Boesky's disclosures will
mean a broad range of new indictments. It also provided new insight
on the extent of his cooperation.
   Boesky's lawyers did not suggest how much the sentence should be
reduced. They also asked Lasker not to consider the request until
about October, claiming by then ``the extraordinary extent and
value of Mr. Boesky's cooperation will become even more evident
than it was at sentencing, or than it can be now.''
   John Carroll, an assistant U.S. attorney handling the Boesky
case, would not comment on the request or other aspects of the
document. But he said the government intended to file a written
response with Lasker by Friday.
   Once Wall Street's best-known speculator in stocks of companies
targeted for possible takeovers, Boesky stunned the financial world
in November 1986 when he paid the Securities and Exchange
Commission a record $100 million to settle charges he illegally
used secret insider information to profit in securities deals. He
was banished from the securities business for life.
   Boesky has since cooperated in a massive federal probe that has
resulted in four criminal charges in the United States, seven in
Britain, four guilty pleas and nine civil actions by the SEC.
   In return, Boesky was allowed to plead guilty to a single count
of conspiracy to lie to the SEC. He was sentenced to three years in
federal prison by Lasker on Dec. 18 and began serving it March 23.
   Five days after sentencing, Boesky was back in debriefing
sessions with federal prosecutors, his lawyers said in the document
filed with Lasker. In addition, the document said he has attended
more than a dozen other meetings since then with agents of the
Justice Department, Internal Revenue Service and SEC.
   It also said the sessions covered ``new topics, new
transactions, new relationships, and new securities growing out of
Mr. Boesky's earlier cooperation and other governmental
investigations.''
   Boesky also helped investigators in analyzing hundreds of
documents involved in its criminal and civil investigations, the
plea contended.
   His lawyers said Boesky cooperated despite a death threat from
former friend and fellow speculator John Mulheren, who was arrested
Feb. 18 with a loaded assault rifle, two pistols and a shotgun
after making death threats. Federal prosecutors have since said
that Boesky implicated Mulheren in illegal conduct.
   In a previously undisclosed detail, his lawyers said federal
officials ``took a number of public and private steps to protect
Mr. Boesky's safety.''
   They also said Mulheren's death threat came ``at a time when
other subjects of the United States Attorney's Boesky-related
investigations had Mr. Boesky under physical surveillance.''
   They said those people, who weren't identified, hired agents who
``watched Mr. Boesky's movements from telephone-equipped cars,
followed him on the streets, questioned other patrons at
establishments he utilized and harassed him in various other ways.''

<HEAD>Northwest Airlines Lifts No-Smoking Assignment From Ad Agency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines is putting another
advertising agency in charge of creating commercials for its
smoke-free flights to relieve tobacco industry pressures on the
agency that created the first ads for its program.
   Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Compton, a huge New York-based agency,
created the first ads for Northwest's no-smoking program and
remains the airline's agency for other general advertising.
   The commercials showed passengers applauding Northwest's plans
to ban smoking on nearly all its domestic flights.
   Shortly after the ads started airing last month, Saatchi was
fired from its longtime job making cookie and candy ads for RJR
Nabisco Inc., which also makes cigarettes.
   Northwest said Wednesday it was moving the no-smoking program
assignment to the Kolesar and Hartwell agency, based in
Minneapolis. The agency already handles Northwest's ads in media
aimed at the travel trade.
   The job involves about $2 million of the estimated $50 million
in Northwest billings handled by Saatchi.
   RJR had cited ``philosophical differences'' for pulling its
cookie and candy assignments from Saatchi, but those familiar with
the decision said privately that RJR executives were troubled
Saatchi had created the no-smoking ads and failed to tell them
about it.
   ``We are extremely disappointed that a reactionary faction of
the tobacco industry continues to put literally dozens of Saatchi &
Saatchi professional careers in jeopardy,'' A.B. Magary, executive
vice president for marketing for Northwest Airlines, said in
explaining why it moved the no-smoking assignment to another agency.
   He said that while the St. Paul, Minn.-based airline was happy
with Saatchi's work, it wanted to make sure that Saatchi ``can
continue to serve us with total objectivity and enthusiasm.''
   Magary declined in an interview to be more specific about what
pressures Saatchi was under from the tobacco industry, but said the
airline had been told the agency continued to feel pressured.
   Magary said Northwest offered to reassign the no-smoking job to
another agency ``in hopes of solving their problem and they
accepted our offer to do it.''
   He said it was up to the agency to elaborate on whatever
pressures they feel they continue to be under.
   But agency spokesmen declined the opportunity to do so.
   ``We understand Northwest's decision with regard to the
no-smoking assignment,'' said Michael Keeshan, executive vice
president and management director in charge of the Northwest
account at Saatchi.
   But he declined to say whether Saatchi supported or solicited
the action, adding only that, ``We are anxious to put this matter
behind us.''
   Saatchi also is the advertising agency for Lorillard Inc.'s True
cigarettes.
   Sara R. Ridgway, a spokeswoman for Lorillard, said the cigarette
company was not putting any pressure on Saatchi in the wake of the
Northwest no-smoking ads. She said Lorillard was happy with
Saatchi's work and planned to retain its relationship with the
agency.

<TEXT>
   Newly elected Chairman Robert E. Allen says
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. has a ``new sense of urgency''
and is committed to sustaining its strong first-quarter profit
increases.
   ``No officer of AT&T is feeling content and complacent,'' Allen
told shareholders Wednesday at the company's annual meeting.
   Allen, 53, was elevated to chairman and chief executive by the
board of directors late Tuesday, a day after the death from colon
cancer of his 62-year-old predecessor, James E. Olson.
   Also on Wednesday, AT&T announced a 10.6 percent increase in its
first quarter earnings. Its earnings per share rose 15 percent
because of a redemption of preferred shares that lessened the
amount that had to be skimmed off for preferred dividends.
   Asked at a news conference whether AT&T could keep up the 15
percent growth in earnings per share for the rest of 1988, Allen
said: ``That's our firm commitment.''
   At the meeting, shareholders rejected a white supremacist
group's resolution that sought to phase out AT&T's affirmative
action but also rejected a proposal to expand affirmative action.
   Allen, who was president and chief operating officer, is a
thoughtful, soft-spoken contrast to the forceful Olson. But the two
men were close and Olson had groomed him as a successor.
   ``This is a bittersweet moment for me,'' Allen told shareholders
with a slight quaver in his voice. ``I sincerely wish it were under
different circumstances.''
   Allen tackled questions about whether he had the steel to
continue Olson's legacy. He said he was proud of his style of
developing trusting relations with colleagues.
   ``First and foremost, I'm a team player,'' Allen told reporters.
   AT&T said its profit rose to $492 million, or 46 cents a share,
from $445 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose 2.8 percent to $8.35 billion from $8.12 billion.
   AT&T's earnings statement indicated continuing difficulties in
selling computers and office equipment. Revenue was flat in the
category of data products, network equipment and business
communications products.
   In contrast, revenue from services, mainly long-distance, was up
8.2 percent.
   While noting that AT&T had done a good job of cutting costs,
Allen said the company must work harder on increasing sales.
   ``No business can live by cost control alone. It must grow,'' he
told reporters.
   Rawleigh Warner, the retired chief of Mobil Corp. and an AT&T
director, told shareholders that Olson spoke with him by phone two
weeks ago and said that ``should anything happen to him, Bob Allen
was his natural successor.''
   Allen had served as president and chief operating officer since
1986. Before that he had held top finance jobs in the company and
had a long career in the Bell telephone companies.
   The resolution against affirmative action was sponsored by the
National Alliance, a white supremacist organization based in
Arlington, Va. Herbert Poinsett of Norcross, Ga., spoke on its
behalf, contending that blacks are less intelligent and affirmative
action hurts the morale of whites.
   The resolution earned votes of 8.6 percent of the shares.
   Allen said AT&T considered the proposal ``highly objectionable''
and tried three times to get the Securities and Exchange Commission
to keep it off the ballot.
   The resolution calling for more affirmative action was
introduced by Alex S. Tillman, a black manager at Bell Laboratories
in Murray Hill, N.J. He said taking better advantage of the talents
of minorities and women made good business sense for AT&T.
   It earned votes of 6 percent of the shares.

   AT&T says a white supremacist group hurt employee
morale with its proposal to phase out affirmative action, even
though the proposal fell far short of victory.
   The resolution by the National Alliance _ which contended that
minorities were intellectually inferior to whites _ drew 8.6
percent of shares voted at Wednesday's annual meeting of
shareholders of American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
   It might have won fewer votes if shareholders had realized the
negative impact it had on the morale of the company's ``family of
employees,'' said Hal Burlingame, AT&T's senior vice president for
human resources.
   An opposing resolution to increase affirmative action, proposed
by Alex Tillman, a black manager at Bell Laboratories, won just 6
percent of the shares voted.
   Some saw the voting as almost a referendum on affirmative action
because AT&T is the most widely-held stock in the United States,
with 2.7 million shareholders.
   Tension was high in Denver's cavernous Currigan Exhibition Hall
as Herbert Poinsett of Norcross, Ga., argued in favor of the
proposal by the Arlington, Va.-based National Alliance.
   More than a dozen shareholders spoke against the National
Alliance proposal, including a Denver man, Harry Methner, who said
he fought Nazi youth in gang wars on the streets of Berlin in 1935
when Nazis used similar arguments of genetic inferiority against
Jews.
   No one spoke in favor except Poinsett, who is the host of a
white supremacist show, ``Race and Reason,'' on an Atlanta public
access television channel.
   Tillman, choked with emotion, said he feared that the wide
circulation given to the National Alliance's ideas would poison the
atmosphere at AT&T.
   ``These kind of comments hang in the air a long time,'' Tillman
said.
   Tillman's resolution said the shortage of minorities and women
in high ranks could hurt AT&T in its dealings with cities with
female or minority mayors and in dealings with foreign cultures.
   Because both resolutions received more than 3 percent support,
their sponsors are entitled to try putting them on the ballot again
next year.
   Robert E. Allen, AT&T's new chairman and chief executive, said
the company would try to keep the National Alliance proposal off
next year's ballot. He said the company tried and failed three
times to have the Securities and Exchange Commission keep it off
the ballot this year.
   ``We find the intent and the wording of this proposal highly
objectionable,'' Allen said.
   The Communication Workers of America, AT&T's biggest union, held
a ``rally against racism'' outside the meeting.
   In a statement from Washington, CWA President Morton Bahr said
the union was pleased that the National Alliance resolution was
``so resoundingly defeated.''

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan to clean up the state's troubled savings
and loan institutions has gotten an overwhelming response from
thrifts ready to participate, according to a spokesman for federal
regulators.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank in Dallas said Wednesday it would
announce later this month the first consolidations in the Southwest
Plan for Texas thrifts.
   The FHLB announced the program in February and requested
proposals from interested parties by March 31.
   ``We have received about 150 proposals from parties interested
in participating in the Southwest Plan,'' said David Colgren, FHLB
spokesman in Dallas. ``This is an overwhelming response of parties
interested in the plan.''
   Of 279 Texas thrifts, 104 were insolvent as of Sept. 30, 1987,
according to the FHLB. Those endangered institutions will be
consolidated, closed or sold, said Colgren.
   M. Danny Wall, FHLB chairman, has said that roughly half the
problems of the nation's thrift industry are in Texas, which has
been hit hard by an energy and real estate slump in recent years.
   Investors would provide up to $1 billion in capital for the
plan. Much of the expense will be paid by the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp., which was expected to provide $7 billion at
first and up to $2 billion annually.
   ``We believe, overall, we need a fair and equitable analysis for
each proposal,'' Colgren said. ``That analysis must balance the
interests of FSLIC and private investors. We anticipate the first
consolidations to be available in late April.''
   Colgren would not say how many S&Ls would be involved in the
first announcement but added that ``a geometric progression of
consolidations'' would be made thereafter.
   Industry officials had said earlier that the state's thrift
crisis increases with every delay, along with the cost of remedies.
   But Colgren said: ``We will not rush into any deal that is bad
for FSLIC and bad for the industry. We do not want to create more
problems. Otherwise, today's solutions become tomorrow's problems.''
   On Monday, FHLB officials reported that the FSLIC's insurance
fund shortfall almost doubled in 1987 to an estimated $11.6 billion.
   ``We anticipate the Southwest Plan to cost FSLIC somewhere
between $6 and 7 billion,'' said Colgren. `` Through FSLIC
recapitalization signed by the president in August of last year, we
will raise $10.8 billion over the next three years...''
   ``Through FSLIC notes, and other sources, we anticipate having
about $20 billion to work with,'' he said.
   Insolvent Texas thrifts will have lost at least $895 million in
operating expenses in the first four months of this year, according
to one analysis.
   ``We believe through consolidation of the industry through the
Southwest Plan, interest from private investors, reducing the cost
of funds that Texas institutions must pay to attract deposits _ the
`Texas premium' _ and using FSLIC sources, we can solve the
problems in Texas,'' Colgren said.

<HEAD>UAW Wants Japanese-Style Pay For Japanese-Style Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers would
consider Chrysler Corp.'s bid to adopt corporate-wide
Japanese-style production methods if its executives accept a less
lucrative Japanese-style pay system, a union official says.
   Workers and union officials joined UAW Vice President Marc Stepp
on Wednesday in sharply criticizing the multimillion-dollar wages
received by top Chrysler executives, particularly Chairman Lee
Iacocca, as the union and No. 3 automaker continued talks over a
new labor contract.
   ``What we're wanting is what's fair and equitable for all of our
members in relation to the standing of the corporation,'' said
Thomas Jackie Russell, president of UAW Local 1413 in Huntsville,
Ala. ``When we hear the type money these guys are making, then that
indicates the standings of the corporation.''
   Negotiations entered their fourth day today over a contract to
replace the one expiring Sept. 14. The pact would cover 66,000
active and laid off workers in 15 states and 65,000 retirees.
   Stepp, the union's chief negotiator, targeted Iacocca the day
after Chrysler disclosed the chairman received $17.9 million in
1987 in salary, cash and stock bonuses and money earned exercising
stock options.
   Iacocca in 1987 was the highest-paid auto company executive for
a second straight year. In 1986, when he earned $20.6 million,
Iacocca also was the nation's highest-paid executive.
   ``Executive compensations have gotten completely out of hand,''
Stepp said. ``It makes it extremely difficult for us to sit down in
a rational manner and try to negotiate a decent contract.''
   Word of Iacocca's pay prompted calls from workers demanding that
union officials seek higher pay or other benefits in their
contract, Stepp said.
   Under the Japanese system cited by Stepp, managers earn six to
eight times more than workers. American managers earn about 18
times more and, in Iacocca's case, 27 times more, Stepp said.
   Chrysler workers earn $14.43 an hour including cost-of-living
adjustments, or gross base pay of about $30,000.
   Stepp also said that before Japanese workers are laid off or
their pay is cut, Japanese managers take a pay cut.
   Stepp raised the pay comparisons a day after Anthony St. John,
Chrysler's chief negotiator, said the automaker has asked union
leaders to support its efforts to adopt so-called Modern Operating
Agreements at all plants. Russell's Local 1413 is one of six plants
where MOAs are in effect.
   The Japanese-style MOA production system organizes workers into
teams, uses them in a variety of jobs instead of a single defined
task and reduces the number of workers needed to cover for
absentees, inspect products and correct mistakes.
   St. John also asked for a committee comprising union, company
and outside representatives to study the effectiveness of job
security provisions in the new contract. The committee also would
look at ways to increase productivity and improve quality, another
weapon in the push for MOA adoption.
   Stepp said the union would consider that proposal if the
committee also could study and adjust top executives' compensation
to bring it into line with the Japanese managers-to-workers pay
ratio.
   ``We think it is only fair that since they ask us to go to a
Japanese production system such as MOAs and team concept...it is
fair for them to go to the Japanese system in terms of
compensation,'' Stepp said.

<TEXT>
   The founders of the Banana Republic chain
of ``adventure clothing'' stores have resigned from the company
because of differences with its owner, The Gap Inc.
   Mel and Patricia Ziegler, who founded Banana Republic in 1978
and sold it to The Gap five years later, announced Wednesday they
were leaving because of ``fundamental creative and cultural
differences'' with Gap management.
   The company also announced it was discontinuing ``Trips''
magazine, San Francisco-based Banana Republic's latest venture. The
magazine was an offbeat look at the world of travel, which touted
itself in its March inaugural issue as the only honest travel
industry magazine.
   In a prepared statement, Mel Ziegler said Banana Republic's
acquisition by The Gap ``allowed us to take our concept further and
faster than we ever imagined. We never expected to stay with this
forever. It's time for us to get on to something new.''
   Mel Ziegler, formerly a writer with the San Francisco Chronicle,
and Patricia Ziegler, an illustrator at the paper, left the
Chronicle to found Banana Republic.
   The Zieglers also developed a successful mail-order business,
with a quarterly catalogue mailed to about 3 million people.
   Since selling The Gap, the Zieglers continued to run it with
creative autonomy until March, Gap officials said.
   In March, The Gap installed its president, Millard Drexler, as
chief executive of Banana Republic, which has 99 stores nationwide.
Banana Republic's sales had been slumping for nearly a year,
although The Gap does not release earnings figures for its

   Donald Fisher, chairman of The Gap, said he had accepted the
Zieglers' resignations with regret.
   ``They built a very intelligent and fun business that brought
touches of theater, art, humor, and literature to retailing and

<HEAD>Goodyear, Rubber Workers Tentatively Agree on Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Rubber Workers and Goodyear Tire &
Rubber Co. early this morning reached a tentative three-year
contract agreement which will be considered at a union meeting
today as a possible model for pacts with Firestone Tire & Rubber
Co. and Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co.
   The contract was reached at 2:30 a.m. Union contracts with
Goodyear, Firestone and Uniroyal Goodrich expired at midnight.
   A majority of the Goodyear's 15,000 union members and a majority
of the 11 plants represented by the union must approve the pact in
order to achieve ratification, said John Perduyn, public
information director for Goodyear.
   The contract provides for wage and benefit increases, though
precise figures will not be available until the contract is
presented to union members. The agreement provides for cost of
living adjustments in each year of the contract, along with
increases in pension benefits and medical benefits, Perduyn said.
   Frank Tully, Goodyear vice president of human resources and
chief company spokesman at negotiations, said the contract, ``is
equitable in that it provides an excellent wage and benefit package
while not jeopardizing the company's competitive position.''
   The contract provides for Goodyear and the URW to meet to
discuss job security, Perduyn said. The pact also provides for a
successor clause that ensures continuation of the contract if a
plant is sold.
   International URW president Milan Stone said the URW's Big Three
Advisory Committee will review the proposed agreement today for
consideration as a pattern settlement for the rubber industry. The
advisory committee and the URW's International Executive Board must
approve any tentative contract before it can be presented to union
members for a vote.
   The URW in April targeted Goodyear as the pattern-setting
company for negotiations in reaching the three-year master contract
for all three tire companies. Of the 26,000 union members affected
by the contract, 15,000 work for Goodyear, 6,500 for Uniroyal
Goodrich, and 4,700 for Firestone.
   Talks began in mid-March for a master contract covering workers
at Goodyear plants in Akron, St. Marys and Marysville, Ohio;
Topeka, Kansas; Gadsden Ala.; Union City, Tenn.; Danville, Va.; New
Bedford, Mass; Sun Prarie, Wisc.; Lincoln, Neb.; and Madisonville,
Ky.
   An agreement on economic issues for Uniroyal Goodrich workers
was ratified earlier this year, with the company promising the URW
locals it will keep open three plants in Indiana and Alabama
through the term of the new contract in exchange for a wage freeze
through April 1990.

<HEAD>GM Wants Healthier Workers, Plans Expansion of Fitness Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. plans to expand a program
aimed at improving the health and fitness of workers, especially
those who suffer from obesity, high blood pressure, mental stress
or substance abuse.
   ``It's already in place in some areas right now. It will be
intensified in July,'' said Dr. George Mackey, GM's health director.
   GM and the United Auto Workers union will run the program, which
will cover roughly 450,000 workers in the United States, Mackey
said Wednesday.
   The No. 1 automaker decided to push the program after reviewing
the results of pilot projects that began in 1985 at four auto
plants. Mackey said the plants were in Warren, Pontiac and Livonia.
   Screening and counseling could cost up to $24 million if all
employees participate, says Jack Erfurt, a researcher for the
Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations at the University of
Michigan.
   GM's potential savings, however, could be much greater. Erfurt
estimates 80 percent of GM's workers suffer some type of health
problem.
   The first step will involve blood pressure checks and a review
of each employee's medical history. Employees can either enter
classes for fitness, losing weight or stoping smoking; adopt
self-help programs, or choose one-on-one counseling.
   Six months later, health care workers will contact employees to
check progress.
   In the pilot program, GM paid the entire cost of initial
screening and two-thirds of the follow-up programs, with employees
paying the remainder. GM's share amounted to roughly $53 per worker
each year, Erfurt said.
   The results of GM's pilot project were mixed. In two plants,
less than 10 percent of the workers entered the health classes, he
said.
   In the other two factories, nearly half the employees did so,
but those workers could choose among self-help programs, counseling
or full-scale classes _ unlike employees in the other two plants.
   GM has supported various health programs for years, mostly on a
plant-by-plant basis, but this one is broader and more ambitious,
Erfurt said.

   Share prices were slightly lower on the London
Stock Exchange at midday Thursday following the release of figures
showing that British money supply and bank lending grew much faster
than expected in March.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 2.7
points, or 0.01 percent, at 1,784.1 at midday local time.
   Volume was light at 236 million shares.
   Share prices opened lower, largely in response to overnight
declines in New York and Tokyo, but attempted a rally in early
trading, moving up to an intraday high of 1786.9.
   The release of disappointing money supply and bank lending data
at 10:30 a.m. local time pushed prices to their lowest levels of
8.5 points down on the 100-share index, traders said.

   The stock market staged a broad advance today,
rebounding from its recent slump.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.92 to 2,000.33
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in the early
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 628 up, 307
down and 478 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.79 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said a relatively steady showing by the dollar in
foreign exchange and the U.S. bond market helped to attract some
buyers.
   Fears of further increases in interest rates appeared to
diminish amid signs that the Federal Reserve wasn't taking any
immediate action to tighten credit.
   Brokers also said traders found some ``bargains'' among the many
stocks that haven't responded much so far to generally strong
earnings reports for the first quarter.
   Columbia Gas System led the active list, down ] at 28{ on top of
a 1-point loss Wednesday, when the company cut its quarterly
dividend from 79.5 cents a share to 50 cents a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .76 to 145.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was off .10 at 297.62.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 14.09 to

   Ford Motor Co. will eliminate its two-seat Escort
EXP model late this summer, making way for increased production of
two- and four-door cars, the company said.
   Ford recalled 50 workers who had been indefinitely laid off from
the Wayne assembly plant after announcing the production change
Wednesday, said Jeff Washington, president of the United Auto
Workers Local 900, which represents 3,100 hourly workers at the
plant.
   The elimination of the EXP will allow increased production of
the Escort, the Escort wagon and the Escort GT, Ford said Wednesday.
   Ford told the Wayne workers it could make more money by building
more Escort GTs, which are high-performance cars based on the
Escort economy car, Washington said.
   The move follows a decision earlier this year by General Motors
Corp. to cease production of the Pontiac Fiero, a rear-engine,
plastic-body, two-seat sports car. GM's decision will result in the
elimination of 1,109 jobs in Pontiac.
   Ford sold 54,502 EXPs in 1981, its best year for the model. In
1987 Ford sold 24,427 EXPs out of 392,360 Escorts.

<HEAD>Gillette, Coniston Square Off at Annual Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANDOVER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of shareholders turned out for
Gillette Co.'s annual meeting today, where the consumer products
giant squared off against Coniston Group in a highly visible
takeover battle.
   The two companies waged a proxy war at the meeting, held at
Gillette's manufacturing center in this town 20 miles north of
Boston.
   Coniston sought four seats on Gillette's board of directors, but
Gillette hoped a coalition of loyal shareholders and last-minute
support from large institutions would render enough votes to repel
the New York group.
   Results of the election are expected later this month.
   Since Coniston went public Feb. 11 with plans to seek control of
Gillette, the two rivals have traded barbs in the press and the
courts.
   Coniston's board candidates have pledged to support the
divestiture of the worldwide empire Gillette built around personal
care products in an effort to increase profitability and boost the
company's stock price.
   Coniston contends Gillette is still mired by the nearly $580
million paid to Revlon Group Inc. in 1986 to abandon its repeated
takeover attempts.
   Gillette, however, has pointed out to its nearly 27,000
shareholders a steady rise in earnings since the company laid off
2,400 workers and the sale of several unprofitable divisions after
signing a 10-year no-takeover pact with Revlon in 1986.
   Last week, Gillette said it might close some North American
plants to further streamline operations.
   The takeover contest will likely be decided by institutional
investors, which own between 60 percent to 65 percent of the 115.5
million Gillette shares outstanding.
   Coniston, which has run newspapers ads attacking Gillette's
``greenmail'' payment to Revlon, claims to have the support of
several major shareholders, including two California pension plans
with about 2.1 million shares and a New York state retirement plan
with nearly 2 million shares.
   Gillette proxy solicitor John Wilcox declined to name
supporters, but he suggested many large shareholders will wait
until the last moment to make a decision.
   Gillette spokesman David Fausch said that since the Coniston bid
does not seek a complete change in control, some large shareholders
may be willing to take a risk for greater profits.
   ``They look at the short-term gains,'' said Fausch. ``This is
only four people on a 12-member board saying they'll push for a
sale. It's not a complete switch in management.''

   Giant corn processor Staley
Continental Inc. today rejected as inadequate a $1.33 billion
takeover bid by British sugar refiner Tate & Lyle PLC.
   Staley Chairman Donald E. Nordlund said the company's board of
directors has instructed management to explore various alternatives
to enhance shareholder value.
   Tate & Lyle is offering $32 a share in cash. In early trading on
the New York Stock Exchange, Staley's stock jumped 50 cents to
$37.25 a share.
   Nordlund said among the alternatives the company would consider
would be a financial restructuring or recapitalization, issuing
stock to a third party, selling all or part of the company, a joint
venture or a leveraged buyout.
   Staley, based in the Chicago suburb of Rolling Meadows, is a
holding company formed in 1985. It owns A.E. Staley Manufacturing
Co., the nation's second-largest refiner of corn sweeteners, and
CFS Continental Inc., a food-service supplier.
   Tate & Lyle, Britain's second-largest sugar refiner, owns nearly
5 percent of Staley's 30.4 million outstanding shares. The
acquisition of Staley would give the company a foothold in the U.S.
corn sweetener market and make it the only supplier of all three
types of sugar _ corn, beet and cane _ in the United States.
   Tate & Lyle could not be reached immediately for comment.

   Schlumberger Ltd. said Thursday its
first-quarter earnings jumped by 19.2 percent over the same period
last year, boosted by an almost two-thirds growth in revenue from
its oil exploration services.
   The world's largest oilfield services company reported a profit
of $101.01 million, or 37 cents per share, on sales of $1.3 billion
in the three months ended March 31. That compared with $4.99
million, or 2 cents per share, on $1.1 billion in revenue during
the same period of 1987.
   Strong world economies helped increase sales, despite weakness
in oil prices during the quarter, said Euan Baird, Schlumberger's
chairman.
   ``In particular, Schulmberger Industries, the electronics and
metering businesses, posted record profits, revenue and orders,''
he said.
   In addition, Baird said the company benefitted from a 24 percent
gain in sales by the company's oilfield services division, and a 61
percent revenue gain by another division that provides services to
locate and evaluate oil and gas.
   Schlumberger is controlled by the founding French family. It is
based in New York and incorporated in the Netherlands Antilles.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the 1800s, the story goes, immigrants coming
to America believed the streets were paved with gold. Nowadays, it
is foreign retailers who are arriving on these shores in search of
their fortunes.
   They are lured by the size of the U.S. market and the American
passion for foreign styles and goods. Several are already reporting
success.
   ``We could get a large slice of the apple'' by selling in
America, said Sophie Mirman, who helped introduce the Sock Shop, a
chain of British hosiery stores, to this country.
   The most prominent of the new arrivals is Campeau Corp. The
Canadian concern bought out Allied Stores Corp. in 1986 and is in
the process of taking over Federated Department Stores Inc.
   To help finance its purchase of Federated, Campeau is selling
Allied's Brooks Brothers chain to another foreign retailer, Marks
and Spencer PLC of Britain.
   Meanwhile, the Australian developer Hooker Corp. moved into
retailing with the purchase last year of the Bonwit Teller, B.
Altman and Sakowitz chains.
   Buying an American company is not the only way to get here. Some
smaller companies are striking out on their own. Sock Shop is among
them; so are Fil a Fil, La Sweaterie and Tricots Caroll, apparel
retailers from France.
   A foreign presence in the U.S. retailing industry is nothing
new. In 1973, Batus Inc., the U.S. arm of Britain's BAT Industries
PLC, swept in with the purchase of Saks Fifth Avenue and the
now-closed Gimbels chain.
   And the fashionable streets of cities like New York, Washington,
Palm Beach and Los Angeles have been graced for years by names such
as Gucci, Courreges and Yves St. Laurent.
   But what is different about many of these latest arrivals is
they are appealing to a larger and different market segment. Many
offer moderately-priced merchandise, giving more consumers a chance
to buy and wear clothes with foreign labels.
   With such prices, the new transplants ``have enormous
development potential in this market,'' said Charles Aug, whose
company, Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc., scouts foreign
retailers and helps them set up shop here.
   Many of the retailers are drawn to the United States in hopes of
equaling the success of the Italian retailer Benetton, Aug said.
   Benetton has grown to 760 stores in the United States _ out of
more than 4,500 worldwide _ since the first U.S. store with its
now-familiar bright green sign opened in Manhattan in 1979, said
Sally Fischer, a spokeswoman for the Italian retailer.
   Said Aug: ``The rapid growth of Benetton generated the interest
of the other European merchants to come over here and start
moving.''
   Benetton stores are operated under licensing agreements with the
Italian company. The stores sell only Benetton fashions, and buy
the clothes from Benetton, Ms. Fischer said.
   Other retailers break into the U.S. market through franchises,
in which they can profit from an American operation without having
the expense and problems of opening and managing stores.
   Printemps, a Denver fashion retailer, is a franchisee of Au
Printemps, a French department store chain. The U.S. store, which
opened in November, operates autonomously of its namesake, but
turns over to Au Printemps a percentage of its sales, said Frank
Ball, president of the American company.
   The Denver store sells French fashions, but is ``Americanized
for practicality,'' said Ball. ``We've used the name, but (the
Denver store is) not a reflection of the store in France.''
   Some retailers own their U.S. outlets. Sock Shop opened three
stores in Manhattan in December, and ``we're delighted with the way
they're going,'' said Ms. Mirman, chairman of the company.
   Because of its size, the United States was one of several
markets Sock Shop wanted to explore, Ms. Mirman said. The company
hopes to open nine more outlets this year and eventually expand
beyond New York.
   The retailers generally get some assistance from American
advisers or brokers before setting up shop. Ms. Mirman said Sock
Shop's entry into the United States was facilitated by a minority
stockholder who lived in New York. La Sweaterie was brought into
the American market through a joint venture with David Genser, the
company's president here.
   Unlike many other foreign retailers, La Sweaterie did not try
New York first, opening instead in the Boston area, where Genser
lives. The retailer now has 29 stores in the United States,
including several in California.
   The weakness of the dollar since 1985 has helped some
foreigners, Aug said, explaining, ``Installation costs would be a
fraction of what it would have cost them a few years ago.''
   But the lower dollar can be a double-edged sword.
   ``It's cheaper to set up shop, but that's offset by the fact
that the market for goods at these price points does not grow ...
when the dollar is buying less,'' said Max Garelick, president of
Rodier U.S.A., the American arm of the French clothing chain Rodier.
   Genser agreed. ``It has hurt us,'' he said of the dollar's
decline. ``All of our clothes are made in France,'' and become more
expensive as the U.S. currency slides.
   One way to fight the impact of currency fluctuations is to
become a more American company. Benetton has started manufacturing
some of its merchandise in Rocky Mount, N.C., Ms. Fischer said.
   ``But the style will remain something that's Italian and French
_ what European companies have to offer,'' she said.

   Donald Trump, who scored a public relations coup
over City Hall by rebuilding the Central Park skating rink, today
offered the same deal for repairing the closed Williamsburg Bridge.
   The real estate mogul took a tour of the decaying, 85-year-old
span, then said he would be willing to put up an estimated $250
million, which the government would repay, for repairs. Trump
rebuilt the Wollman Skating Rink under a similar arrangement.
   ``An easy solution is to spend a lot of money but if you can
spend a little money and get the same results for it, or a better
result, that's what I'd be here for,'' Trump said.
   The bridge was closed last week when city transportation
officials found cracks in its beams. An inspection is under way to
determine the extent of the damage, and officials have said the
bridge will be closed at least three weeks.
   Alfred A. DelliBovi, head of the federal Urban Mass
Transportation Administration, had invited Trump to examine the
bridge, and joined him for today's tour.
   In a letter to Trump, Dellibovi lauded him as a builder whose
projects come in ``on time, under budget and built to last.''
   In 1987, Trump showed up the city bureaucracy when he took over
repair of the skating rink and finished the job in five months and
under budget. The city had spent 7{ years and $12 million on what
was supposed to take 2{ years and $4.5 million.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened lower today on
the Chicago Board of Trade on improved prospects for rain in dry
growing regions.
   Reports of good progress in the Brazilian soybean harvest and
weak demand for soybean products on European markets added to the
losses in soybean futures, which were down more than 7{ cents a
bushel in early trading.
   But rain was the major factor affecting all the grain markets,
said Richard Loewy, senior grain and oilseed analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``There are forecasts for systems to come in and get some
moisture to the western corn belt states of Iowa and Nebraska, and
that's important because they've been dry,'' Loewy said.
   ``There's also the prospect for some of this moisture getting up
into the spring wheat areas'' of the northern Plains, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 1 cent lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.15\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to
1} cents lower with May at $2.03\ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to

<TEXT>
   U.S. food giant Borden Inc. lost another round
Thursday in its court battle to squeeze into the British lemon
juice market.
   The Court of Appeal dismissed Borden's appeal against last
year's High Court ruling preventing the company from selling
ReaLemon on the grounds consumers would confuse it with Jif, a
popular British product manufactured by Reckitt and Colman.
   Both products contain lemon juice in plastic lemon-shaped
squeeze containers.
   Reckitt and Colman has fought off several rival products since
introducing Jif in 1957 and Lord Justice Slade said it had
established an exclusive right to the particular ``get-up'' of the
product.

<HEAD>EEC Wants Members to Authorize Self-Made Electricity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community
recommended that its 12 member governments authorize individuals to
make their own electricity and buy up all excess energy from
private sources.
   The EEC's executive Commission said Thursday that private
production of electricity is being discouraged or even banned
throughout the trading bloc by legislation that presents
``insurmountable obstacles to self-generation'' of electricity by
users.
   The Commission, in a formal recommendation, said the member
governments should allow self-production and obligate utility
companies to buy surplus energy at fair prices.
   Such a system, it said, would help stimulate the development of
alternative sources of energy and lead to better use of available
resources.

<HEAD>GM First-Quarter Earnings Up 18.4 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. said Thursday its
first-quarter earnings rose 18.4 percent, helped by a change in
accounting methods.
   The nation's largest automaker said it earned $1.09 billion, or
$3.11 a share, on sales of $26.44 billion. GM earned $922.5
million, or $2.62 a share, on sales of $26.1 billion in
first-quarter 1987.
   GM was the first of the Big Three auto companies to report its
earnings for the first quarter. Ford Motor Co., which outearned GM
in 1986 and 1987, and Chrysler Corp. will report earnings next week.
   First-quarter results were fattened by $224 million, or 70 cents
a share, by a Jan. 1 accounting change, GM said. Without the
change, GM's first-quarter earnings would have been $868 million,
down 5.9 percent from a year ago.
   GM said Wednesday earnings rose for two of its subsidiaries, GM
Hughes Electronics Corp. and Electronic Data Systems Corp., but
fell for the third, General Motors Acceptance Corp. because of low
interest rates to consumers.
   GM's worldwide vehicle sales were down 5.2 percent from
first-quarter 1987, but its U.S. sales of domestic and imported
cars rose more than 12 percent. Quarterly truck sales jumped 24
percent.
   GM said its share of the U.S. car market grew 4.1 percentage
points in the first quarter from the final quarter of 1987 and it
gained 2.2 points in truck market share.
   Overseas sales rose 15.5 percent in the first quarter, GM said.
   The automaker's operating earnings fell 4.3 percent to $657.6
million in the first quarter from $687.4 million a year ago.
   GM said it made improvements in manufacturing efficiency and
engineering, but the gains were not enough to offset lower sales,
GMAC's lower earnings and other cost increases.
   ``We're going to continue to cut costs and improve the
efficiency of our plants and the quality of our products,'' the
company said in a statement attributed to company Chairman Roger
Smith and President Robert Stempel.
   In 1987, GM trimmed $3.7 billion from its costs under the first
phase of a four-year plan that calls for $4 billion in cost cuts in
1988. GM said it cut $1.3 billion from its costs in first-quarter
1988.
   The company said it was encouraged by U.S. sales, which rose
against year ago figures for each month of the third quarter. GM's
lineup includes its new mid-size siblings, the Pontiac Grand Prix,
Buick Regal and Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. GM said it had record
truck sales during the quarter.

   Salomon Inc. reported Thursday its first quarter
profit rose 16 percent over a year ago, reflecting strength in the
company's securities and commodities units.
   The giant financial services company said it netted $173
million, or $1.19 a share, during the first three months of this
year, compared with $149 million, or $1.13 a share, in the same
period of 987.
   Quarterly revenue, however, fell to $1.61 billion from $1.72
billion.
   Pre-tax earnings at the company's Salomon Brothers brokerage
unit rose to $253 million from $248 million in 1987, which
``reverses a nine-month period of declining profitability,''
Chairman John Gutfreund said.
   In Salomon's commodities operations, Phibro Energy's earnings
before taxes totaled $27 million, up from $24 million.
   Salomon's Philipp Brothers unit reported its pre-tax profit was
up five-fold, to $15 million from $3 million. Salomon Commercial
Finance earned $45 million, compared with $36 million.
   ``After a difficult restructuring period and the streamlining of
the securities organization last fall, and post-crash turmoil in
financial markets, our expectations of improved profitability are
being realized,'' Gutfreund said in a statement.

<HEAD>Worldwatch Official Says Its Time To Wean Farmers from Oil</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Worldwatch is correct for the organization, World Watch for
the magazine.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The huge production of American farmers
developed at first from a land mass that seemed limitless to early
settlers. Until about 1950, when more food was needed, larger crops
were planted.
   But from that point on, farmers relied on boosting the
productivity of their land to get more bushels from fewer acres,
says Lester R. Brown, president of Worldwatch Institute, a private,
non-profit research organization based in Washington, D.C.
   And to do that, he said, farmers rapidly became hooked on oil _
the fossil-based energy that provides fuel for tractors and
irrigation pumps. The fossil fuels, which include natural gas, also
became a giant provider of chemical fertilizers used to boost
per-acre yields.
   The basic problem, says Brown in World Watch magazine, is that
where once there were lakes of oil beneath the surface of America,
there are now only puddles.
   ``In North America, which produces nearly one-fifth of the
world's grain, 80 percent of the oil discovered to date already has
been burned,'' he said. ``Current proven reserves in the United
States total 36 billion barrels, enough to supply domestic needs
for less than nine years at current rates of use.''
   The problem is not confined to the United States. The Third
World countries which have rising food demands, no oil reserves and
limited funds for expanding imports could be headed for traumatic
times.
   The Indian subcontinent, which has nearly a billion people to
feed _ and, according to World Bank projections, another billion on
the way before population growth stops _ has less than 1 percent of
the world's oil reserves.
   China, which also has a billion people, is expected to show only
modest population growth and is in somewhat better shape. But it
has only 3 percent of the global oil reserves.
   ``The Middle East, with reserves of 398 billion barrels, lies at
the other end of spectrum,'' Brown said. ``It has 56 percent of the
world's oil reserves and only 4 percent of the people. Moreover,
the Middle East's share of the remaining world oil reserves is
rising as reserves outside the region are rapidly depleted.''
   Brown said that while OPEC _ the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries _ has had difficulties agreeing on production
strategy, ``the growing Middle East control of the world's oil is
setting the stage for prices to rise in the not-too-distant
future.''
   He added: ``With petroleum reserves concentrated in one region
and with food production becoming more oil-dependent, food security
and access to oil are becoming closely entwined issues.''
   Brown noted that as the 20th century began, the world's farmers
were almost entirely energy self-sufficient. The sun provided
energy for crops to grow, livestock provided fertilizer and animal
power for tillage. Farmers supplied labor for planting and
harvesting.
   Today, on the average, the world's farmers use the equivalent of
more than a barrel of oil to produce a ton of grain. Each year, he
said, it takes more.
   ``Since 1950, agriculture's use of fossil fuels has multiplied
sixfold,'' Brown said. ``Between 1950 and 1985, the farm tractor
fleet quadrupled, world irrigated area tripled, and fertilizer use
increased ninefold.''
   Despite agriculture's heavy reliance on oil, its share of world
oil use remains small, so a shortage of oil for food production is
not of immediate concern, he said.
   ``The economics of food production are, however, increasingly
shaped by the price of oil,'' Brown said. ``Moreover, in contrast
to some other important oil-using activities _ such as electricity
generation, which is reducing its dependence on oil _ agriculture's
reliance on oil is rising, making it more vulnerable to future
price increases.''
   Some observations:
   _Draft animals are still used extensively for tillage in Africa
and Asia, but the real workhorses of modern agriculture are
tractors. As much as two-thirds of the world's cropland may now be
plowed with tractors. The global tractor fleet has increased from
fewer than 6 million in 1950 to 24 million today.
   _World use of chemical fertilizers soared from 14 million to 131
million tons between 1950 and 186. As cropland area per person
declined, fertilizer use per person increased. This increase was
largely reponsible for world grain production climbing to 1.66
billion metric tons from 624 million during the same period.
   However, in some agriculturally advanced countries fertilizer
use is leveling off. In the United States, for example, fertilizer
use peaked in 1981 and then dropped as land prices and the farm
economy weakened.
   _Irrigation today ranks third behind tractors and fertilizer as
an energy user. In 1900, world irrigation encompassed an estimated
100 million acres. By 1950, it grew to 230 million acres. Today,
the irrigated area is about 670 million acres and has contributed
greatly to record advances in global food production. That includes
the use of both surface water and underground sources, which
require energy-intensive pumping to get it to crops.
   ``The worldwide production of oil and grain has moved in
opposite directions since 1978. Both moved steadily upward from
1950 to 1978, but since then, oil production has fallen while grain
output has continued to go up,'' Brown said.
   ``More importantly,'' he added, ``the demand for grain is
projected to rise until at least the middle of the next century,
while oil production is projected to decline over the same period.''
   Brown said the challenge to the world's agricultural scientists
is to devise less energy intensive methods of expanding world food
output. Recent moves by American farmers to ``minimum till'' and
``no-till'' crop production is a step in that direction, he said.
   Another move has been Brazil's use of more tractors using
ethanol, or fuel alcohol made from sugarcane.
   ``Agriculture cannot expand its use of petroleum indefinitely in
a world where oil production is falling,'' Brown said.

   Stock prices closed higher in light trading
Thursday after the market turned bullish when Wall Street opened
higher.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed up 5.1
points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,791.9.
   Volume was a light 397.9 million shares, compared with
Wednesday's 451.4 million shares.
   On Wall Street Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average opened
higher and moved up more than 30 points by the time London trading
wound down.
   Some traders in London had predicted that Wall Street would open
sharply higher because stock index futures closed at a premium
Wednesday in New York and would trigger computer-generated buy
programs.
   ``We were expecting Wall Street to come in stronger to give us
the lead we've been looking for all week,'' one equities salesman
said.
   Earlier Thursday, the Bank of England reported
larger-than-expected bank lending figures which disappointed the
market and caused a brief afternoon sell-off, dealers said.
   Traders cautioned that volume was extremely low, which can
magnify price movements.
   ``It only takes one or two trades to knock prices around in a
market such as this one,'' a dealer said.

<HEAD>Profit Up at Time, Times Mirror; Loss Reported at Houghton Mifflin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Inc. said Thursday its first-quarter profit jumped 43
percent while another publishing and broadcast concern, Times
Mirror Co., said its earnings climbed 29 percent from a year
earlier.
   Meanwhile, the publisher Houghton Mifflin Co., said normal
seasonal sluggishness in educational book orders produced a wider
loss for the company in the first quarter.
   Time, which is based in New York, said its magazine, books,
programming and cable television operations each turned in improved
results.
   It reported a profit of $66 million, or $1.13 a share, for the
three months ended March 31, compared with earnings of $46 million,
or 76 cents a share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue rose 13.4 percent to $1.07 billion from
$939 million a year earlier.
   Time said the pretax operating profit from its magazine group
rose 19 percent to $70 million because of a rise in advertising
sales that was attributed in part to the Olympics and an increase
in circulation revenue.
   Time publishes Time, Life, People, Sports Illustrated, Money and
Fortune magazines, among others.
   Time's books group broke even in contrast to an operating loss
of $3 million a year earlier. The group's results reflect a
seasonal loss at the Scott, Foresman educational book subsidiary,
improved profits at the Oxmoor House and Little Brown units and a
smaller profit at Time-Life Books.
   Operating income from the Time programming segment rose 8
percent to $39 million, as Home Box Office Inc. reported subscriber
growth and the release of several successful HBO videocassettes,
including the film ``Platoon.''
   In cable television, Time's operating profit from its 82
percent-owned American Television and Communications Corp. unit
rose 24 percent to $42 million, mostly due to new subscribers and
price increases.
   Times-Mirror, which is based in Los Angeles, said its results
were boosted by strong cable television perfomance and sales of
assets.
   The company reported net earnings of $75.1 million, or 58 cents
per share, up from $58.2 million, or 45 cents per share, in the
first quarter of 1987.
   Revenue for the quarter ended March 27 was $797.1 million, up
11.4 percent from $715.8 million in 1987.
   Operating profit improved 17 percent, paced by a 20 percent rise
in cable television revenues, absence of losses at the Denver Post,
which was sold in December 1987, and sales of timberlands and the
Times Mirror Press.
   Times-Mirror publishes the Los Angeles Times, Newsday, New York
Newsday, the Hartford Courant, the Baltimore Sun Newspapers and
others. It has interests in broadcast and cable television, book,
magazine and other publishing.
   Houghton Mifflin, which is based in Boston, said its loss
widened to $10.3 million in the first three months of 1988 from
$6.7 million a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter fell 4.7 percent to $37.8 million from
$39.7 million a year earlier.
   Harold T. Miller, chairman and chief executive, said the loss
reflected the normal seasonal ordering pattern of educational
institutions, and said he expects the sluggishness to continue
through the second quarter.
   Educational publishing sales were off 9 percent in the quarter,
while early book returns pushed down net sales in the college
division by an unspecified amount.
   General publishing sales were up 3 percent, led by strong sales
of juvenile books.

<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc., the nation's largest consumer products
company, reported Thursday its first-quarter earnings increased
24.1 percent while Colgate-Palmolive Co. said it had a 16 percent
net income gain.
   RJR Nabisco, based in Atlanta, said it earned $273 million, or
$1.09 per share, on $3.8 billion in sales for the quarter ended
March 31. That compares to $220 million, or 84 cents per share, on
$3.5 billion in sales in the comparable quarter of 1987.
   RJR's first quarter results included a gain on the sale of the
distiller Heublein Inc. The company said the gain was offset by
expenses related to restructuring activities and the cost of
retirement of high-interest debt.
   Tobacco sales were up to $1.5 billion from $1.4 billion despite
lower domestic volume, the company said. RJR credited dollar
exchange rates internationally and higher prices domestically for
the increase.
   Food sales were $2.28 billion, up from $2.1 billion, the company
said.
   ``We are especially pleased that these gains were achieved while
we continue to invest in strengthening our businesses for future
growth,'' Chairman F. Ross Johnson said.
   RJR manufactures such products as Winston cigarettes and
Nabisco, Del Monte and Planters foodstuffs.
   New York-based Colgate-Palmolive's earnings climbed to $65.4
million, or 96 cents per share, on sales of $1.45 billion in the
most recent quarter. The company had $56.4 million in earnings in
1987's first three months, or 81 cents per share, on sales of $1.31

<TEXT>
   Billionaire couple Harry and Leona Helmsley, in
a repeat of last week's state court appearance, pleaded innocent
today to federal charges stemming from an alleged $4 million tax
scam.
   Their pleas of ``not guilty'' _ the only words they spoke during
arraignment in U.S. District Court _ were followed by a date with
federal marshals for fingerprinting and mug shots.
   The 79-year-old Helmsley and his wife, whose combined estimated
net worth of $1.4 billion makes them among the world's richest
couples, sat in court with several defendants in the ``Pizza
Connection II'' heroin smuggling trial.
   At the government's recommendation, the Helmsleys were released
without bail, but must surrender their passports pending trial. The
same applied to two former Helmsley employees who are co-defendants
and also pleaded innocent.
   The couple's lawyers have charged that the wealth and prominence
of the Helmsleys, who have vast commercial real estate holdings
including a string of hotels, was a factor in their indictment.
   ``The fact that the prosecutors themselves have stated that
their investigations were triggered by articles in a New York
newspaper has led many to conclude that both the state and the
federal indictment are motivated by the prominence of the
Helmsleys,'' lawyers Stephen E. Kaufman and Gerald A. Feffer said
in a statement.
   The federal charges, a 47-count indictment that accuses the
Helmsleys of improperly claiming $4 million in deductions, are part
of an ``unfair and groundless'' attack, the lawyers said.
   The indictment alleges that the couple masked expenditures for
home renovations and other personal purchases as business expenses.
   The attorneys accused prosecutors of leaks involving the case;
singling out the Helmsleys due to their high profiles; and basing
state and federal charges on false allegations.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani and state Attorney General Robert
Abrams last week announced twin indictments for tax fraud against
Helmsley and his wife, the self-proclaimed ``hotel queen.''
   The couple was named with two Helmsley employees in a 188-count
state indictment and the federal indictment for masking the
renovations and several purchases as business expenses.
   They pleaded innocent April 14 in state court after they were
booked and fingerprinted. The federal indictment additionally
charges Mrs. Helmsley, 67, and Frank Turco, 45, of Lutz, Fla., with
attempted extortion of Helmsley employees and contractors.
   In addition to Turco, former Helmsley financial manager Joseph
Licari, 51, of Oyster Bay Cove was named in both indictments.

<HEAD>Textron Reports Higher First Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Textron Inc. said its first-quarter
earnings dropped 36 percent because of a $20 million arbitrator's
award against an insurance subisidiary and early payment of
high-interest debt.
   The aerospace, commercial products and financial services
company reported Thursday it earned $38.7 million, or 43 cents per
share, down from $60.2 million, or 72 cents per share, during the
first three months of 1987.
   Revenue for the quarter ended April 2, 1988, was unchanged from
the year-earlier period at $1.8 billion.
   The earnings drop was attributed to the $20 million award
against Balboa Insurance Co. of Irvine, Calif., a subsidiary of
Textron's Avco Financial Services. The consumer dispute involved
auto insurance Balboa sold for a Mutual of Omaha subsidiary.
   Earnings also were reduced by a one-time $9.7 million
expenditure for early redemtion of $130 million in high-interest
debt.
   Without those charges, income from continuing operations was up
11 percent.
   Referring to gains in aerospace propulsion and finance divisions
and a reduction in the company's federal tax rate, Chairman B.F.
Dolan said, ``the favorable first quarter earnings from continuing
operations get us off to an excellent start this year.''

<HEAD>American Express Reports Drop In Quarterly Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Express Co. said Thursday its
first-quarter profit fell 15 percent from the same period of 1987,
when the giant financial services company recorded a big one-time
tax-related gain.
   The company, however, said its Travel Related Services division,
which runs its credit card business, had record earnings. Shearson
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. also posted strong income during the
period, the first to include E.F. Hutton results, it said.
   For the first three months of this year, American Express netted
$266 million, or 62 cents a share, on revenue of $5.3 billion. That
compared with a restated profit of $314 million, or 71 cents, and
$4.1 billion in revenue a year ago.
   Last year's net income included $49 million of deferred income
tax benefits recorded to comply with new accounting rules.
Excluding those benefits, the first quarter earnings that year
would have totaled $265 million, about the same as this year.
   Chairman James D. Robinson III called ``most impressive'' the
latest quarterly results of American Express' Travel Related
Services and IDS Financial Services units.
   At Travel Related Services, earnings climbed 18 percent to a
record $171 million from $145 million. Revenue totaled $1.6
billion, up 17 percent from last year. The company said its
credit-card charge volume and average travelers checks outstanding
all posted ``double-digit gains.''
   IDS Financial Services had a 19 percent jump in earnings to a
record $31 million from $26 million, American Express said. The
company said annuity and life insurance operations led the increase
and that earnings also were helped by higher management fees.
   Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings reported net income of $811
milion, compared with $78 million last year. The results included
E.F. Hutton, which was acquired by the securities firm late last
year. Revenue totaled $2.5 billion, up from $1.7 billion.
   American Express said its share of Shearson Lehman's first
quarter net was $52 million, reflecting the company's reduced
equity interest.
   American Express Bank reported first quarter net income of $27
million, after absorbing a one-time after-tax charge of $3.8
million related to staff reductions in New York. In 1987, first
quarter net income totaled $56 million, including a $19 million
gain from accounting changes.
   ``Although American Express Bank's net was down from a year ago,
its emphasis on private banking and other fee-generating activities
continues to yield positive results,'' Robinson said.
   The company said its banking unit ``continued its orderly exit
from cross-border term lending.'' Its provision for loan losses,
particulary those from troubled Third World countries, rose 56
percent to $7.8 million from $5 million.

   The stock market turned upward today, rebounding
from its recent slump.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 10.45 to

   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 862 up, 595 down and
483 unchanged.
   Analysts said a relatively steady showing by the dollar in
foreign exchange and the U.S. bond market helped to attract some
buyers to stocks.
   Fears of further increases in interest rates appeared to
diminish amid signs that the Federal Reserve wasn't taking any
immediate action to tighten credit.
   Brokers also said traders found some ``bargains'' among the many
stocks that haven't responded much so far to generally strong
earnings reports for the first quarter.
   Columbia Gas System dropped ] to 28{ on top of a 1-point loss
Wednesday, when the company cut its quarterly dividend from 79.5

   Soybean futures prices closed sharply lower
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade as rain dampened the dry
fields of the western Corn Belt and the South American soybean
harvest accelerated. Grains also closed lower.
   Rain in western Iowa and Nebraska, where spring planting has
just begun, melted fears that dry conditions would delay
germination of seeds, analysts said.
   Soybean prices came under additional pressure from the Brazilian
soybean harvest, now more than 50 percent complete, and the
beginning of the Argentine soybean harvest, said Richard Loewy,
senior grain and oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc in New York.
   ``They should be 80 to 85 percent finished in May,'' he said of
the South American harvest. ``Then our crush and export rate will
tail off, and you don't get as much domestic meal feeding anyway as
we get into the warmer weather.''
   Further pressure on the soy complex came from an American
Soybean Association statement that it did not expect the
Agriculture Department to offer the Soviet Union 170 thousand
metric tons of U.S. soybean oil under its Export Enhancement
Program, Loewy said.
   At the close, wheat was } cent to 1\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.14{ a bushel; corn was 1} cents

<HEAD>Smoking Aboard Most Airline Flights About to be Snuffed Out</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to insert dropped word ``percent''</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aboard thousands of airline flights the
smoking lamp is about to be extinguished.
   The federal ban on cigarette smoking on domestic flights of two
hours or less _ about 80 percent of the total _ takes effect at
12:01 a.m. Saturday. Beforehand, some avid smokers are
reconsidering train travel while others search for ways to keep
their tobacco urges under control, at least for a few hours.
   Government and airline industry officials said Thursday they
expect the new smoking restrictions to cause few problems, although
some confusion may exist for the first few days.
   ``On the whole I think we're in reasonably good shape on this,''
said Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley, whose departmentissued
the new restrictions earlier this month in compliance with a law
enacted by Congress last year.
   The Transportation Department and the Federal Aviation
Administration have come under some criticism, however, for not
pushing the airlines hard enough to publicize details of the new
restrictions and avoid passenger confusion.
   ``The airlines do not have a uniform policy to inform the
public'' about the new rules, said Susan Bianchi-Sand, president of
the 21,000-member Association of Flight Attendants.
   She said at least one airline inserted details about the new
requirements into flight crew manuals only this week and four
airlines are continuing to book seats in smoking sections of
no-smoking flights.
   The airlines said they hope a series of announcements to
passengers _ both before and after boarding a flight _ will limit
the confusion and perhaps head off any disturbances. Industry
spokesmen noted that a smoking ban on flights within in California
has been largely accepted since it went into effect at the first of
the year.
   An estimated 13,600 domestic flights a day will be affected by
the no-smoking edict. International flights are not affected and
the length of a flight will be determined by the time shown in the
airlines' official schedule.
   Even if a flight is delayed in the air or on the ground and goes
beyond two hours, smoking will be prohibited if the schedule has it
as lasting two hours or less, FAA officials said.
   The government has defined a flight as being any single segment
between two cities. Thus, for example, a traveler flying from
Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles with a stop in St. Louis would not
be able to smoke on the first leg of the flight, but would be
allowed to do so on the second, longer leg.
   One major carrier, Northwest Airlines, is prohibiting smoking on
all its flights within the continental United States, but so far no
other airline has followed suit.
   ``We don't think our customers want us to become a non-smoking
airline. If they tell us to do so, we will,'' Robert Crandall,
chairman of American Airlines and himself a heavy smoker, said
recently.
   The battle over whether airline passengers should be allowed to
smoke has been raging for nearly two decades, and forces on both
sides of the issue say the fight is far from over despite the new
restrictions.
   Anti-smoking groups promise to push for a total ban on smoking
aboard airliners, while the tobacco industry and many of its most
loyal customers are gearing up to have the limited smoking
prohibitions reversed in Congress.
   The legislation enacted last year calls for the issue to
re-examined in two years.
   ``Believe me, we're working full speed ahead and so is the
tobacco industry,'' says Ahron Leightman, president of Citizens
Against Tobacco Smoke. ``This is halftime in a football game. We're
up 6-0, and during halftime the forces are regrouping.''
   ``We remain very opposed to the two-hour ban,'' said Brennan
Moran, a spokeswoman for the industry trade group, the Tobacco
Institute.
   Two-thirds of airline passengers favor a smoking ban on
airlines, according to a study at the University of Missouri.
Officials at Northwest Airlines said they instituted their ban on
all flights after a survey showed only one in 10 passengers wanted
to sit in the smoking section.
   Neverthelss, some heavy smokers may find the adjustment
difficult, said Dr. Donald Powell, executive director of the
American Institute for Preventive Medicine, which has worked with
hospitals and corporations to help people deal with stress
management including smoking problems.
   `Certainly when people fly there's a sense of loss of control.
When we feel lack of control we feel stress, so the urges of a
smoker to smoke are more pronounced among people when they fly,''
Powell said.
   He suggested a few tips to battle the no-smoking pangs:
   _Stay away from alcohol because it increases the desire to
smoke. Also avoid coffee or soft drinks containing caffeine.
   _Close the ashtrays near your seat to eliminate the smell of
tobacco that is likely to linger.
   _Walk in the cabin when the smoking urge become acute.
   _Keep your mind and hands busy by reading, working a crossword
puzzle or playign with a deck of cards.
   _When the urge peaks, take a deep breath, hold the air for 3
seconds and slowely exhale.
   _Place a rubber band around the wrist our your smoking arm and
when the urge hits ``give yourself a little zap.''
   ``We're trying to keep people from climbing the cabin walls,''
said Powell.

   BankAmerica Corp. said Thursday its
earnings jumped 62 percent in the first quarter, marking the third
straight quarter of profitability for the recovering banking giant.
   BankAmerica, parent of Bank of America and the nation's
third-largest bank holding company, said its first-quarter earnings
totaled $109 million, or 56 cents per share, up from $67 million,
or 34 cents per share, in the first three months of 1987.
   Operating profit, which excludes one-time gains or losses, also
was on the positive side for the third straight quarter, said Frank
Newman, chief financial officer. He declined to give a dollar value
for operating profit.
   BankAmerica returned to profitability in the third quarter of
1987 after six straight quarters of red ink blamed on loan losses,
high expenses and reserves set aside for foreign debt. Net losses
from 1985 through the first half of 1987 totaled $1.92 billion.
   ``BankAmerica's solid performance in the first quarter clearly
demonstrates that our recovery is continuing,'' said A.W. Clausen,
the bank's chairman. ``We're making steady progress toward our
goals, but many challenges still lie ahead.''
   Net interest income for the quarter ended March 31 reached $775
million, up from $729 million in the same period last year.
Non-interest income during the first quarter this year was $424
million, down from $715 million in the first quarter of 1987.
   Net credit losses were $92 million, down from $315 million in
the first quarter of 1987.
   BankAmerica's assets stood at $94.3 billion.
   Last month's $28 million settlement of a class-action suit by
stockholders who said the company concealed information about its
financial problems was provided for earlier and did not affect
first-quarter results, the company said.
   The company is expected to eliminate about 5,000 jobs this year
from its workforce of approximately 59,500.

   Evidence presented in Newark's closely
watched ``cigarette trial'' indicates tobacco companies conspired
to hide the dangers of smoking, and the jury trial should continue,
a federal judge declared today.
   At the same time, however, Judge H. Lee Sarokin dismissed a
claim that the three companies sued in the liability case _ Liggett
Group Inc., Philip Morris Inc. and Lorillard Inc. _ caused Rose
Cipollone's lung cancer by not marketing a safer cigarette.
   Attorneys for Mrs. Cipollone argued that the companies knew they
could develop a safer cigarette that had less potential of causing
cancer. Mrs. Cipollone, 64, of Lakehurst, died in 1984 after 40
years of smoking.
   But the judge said the attorneys for Mrs. Cipollone's estate,
carrying on a lawsuit filed before she died, had not presented
evidence to support that claim.
   Nevertheless, Sarokin, of U.S. District Court, said the jury
trial will continue over whether the three manufacturers conspired
to misrepresent and conceal facts regarding the dangers of smoking.
He also said Mrs. Cipollone's estate could continue seeking
punitive damages.
   Sarokin said that the evidence indicates that the cigarette
industry ``entered into a sophisticated conspiracy.
   ``The conspiracy was organized to refute, undermine and
neutralize information coming from the scientific and medical
community and, at the same time, to confuse and mislead the
consuming public in an effort to encourage existing smokers to
continue and new persons to commence smoking,'' the judge said.
   Sarokin also said ``a jury might reasonably conclude ... that
the defendants in particular, and the industry in general,
intentionally and willfully ignored the known health consequences
to consumers from the sale of their products.''
   ``The evidence presented also permits the jury to find the
tobacco industry conspiracy vast in its scope, devious in its
purpose and devastating in its results,'' the judge said.
   But Sarokin dismissed claims that Philip Morris and Lorillard
failed to warn Mrs. Cipollone of the dangers of cigarettes.
   The judge said Mrs. Cipollone did not start smoking cigarettes
manufactured by those two companies until she was a veteran smoker
and the companies had no duty to warn her about any dangers until
she became a consumer of their products.
   Similar claims against Liggett, however, were allowed to
continue.
   The trial, which began Feb. 1, is viewed by both the industry
and smoking opponents as critical in the tobacco companies' efforts
to defend against future liability cases.

   A sudden afternoon downdraft wiped out an early
gain in the stock market today, leaving prices little changed from
Wednesday.
   Analysts said swings in prices of stock-index futures prompted
professionals engaged in program trading to sell the futures and
buy individual stocks in the early going.
   At midafternoon, they said, the balance abruptly reversed and
selling programs hit the stock market.
   Brokers said the effect was especially pronounced because many
other investors have been shying away from the stock market lately,
and thus contributing to its potential volatility.
   They noted that many stocks haven't responded much so far to
generally strong earnings reports for the first quarter.

<TEXT>
   McDonald's Corp., which operates the
nation's biggest chain of fast-food restaurants, said Thursday its
first-quarter profit rose 18 percent from a year ago as its revenue
climbed 15 percent.
   First-quarter earnings rose to $125.8 million, or 67 cents a
share, for the first three months of 1988 compared with earnings of
$106.9 million, or 56 cents per share, in 1987.
   Total revenue for the first-quarter climbed to $1.23 billion
from $1.07 billion in 1987.
   Systemwide sales, which represents sales at franchised and
affiliated restaurants as well as those that the company operates,
rose 15 percent to $3.59 billion in the first quarter from $3.12
billion in 1987.
   McDonald's recently opened its 10,000th restaurant in Dale City,
Va.
   The company said the systemwide sales increase resulted from
higher sales from existing restaurants, new restaurant expansion
and the effect of stronger foreign currencies against the dollar.
   Domestic sales, helped by new product introductions such as
``Cheddar Melt'' hamburgers, climbed by 10 percent to $2.53
billion, the company said.
   The company, which recently opened restaurants in Yugoslavia and
South Korea, said the decline in the dollar helped it post a 30
percent gain in sale outside the United States to $1.06 billion
during the quarter from $811.6 million a year earlier.
   Without the decline in the dollar, foreign sales would have
risen only 17 percent from a year earlier.

   The dollar moved narrowly higher against most
major currencies Thursday in uneventful trading.
   Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid of $454.65 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from
$456 late Wednesday.
   Traders said the dollar remained in a narrow range throughout
the session, and volume was light.
   ``It's the same pattern we've seen the last couple of days,''
said James McGroarty, a vice president at Discount Corp.
   He noted that the dollar continued to ``take somewhat of a back
seat against the British pound,'' with the pound testing the $1.90
mark against the U.S. currency.
   A report of faster-than-expected growth in Britain's money
supply led market participants in London to believe sterling
interest rates will not be lowered.
   ``That makes the pound an attractive alternative to the
dollar,'' McGroarty said.
   Ian Spence, chief dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.,
noted that market participants remain bearish about the U.S.
currency. But most traders believe fears of central bank
intervention keep investors from trying to aggressively sell their
dollar holdings.
   The dollar also rose earlier in uneventful European dealings.
Foreign exchange dealers said an absence of fundamental news kept
the U.S. currency in a narrow range for mostly technical reasons.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.40 yen to a closing 124.30. Later in London, it
was quoted at a slightly lower 124.18 yen. In New York, the dollar
closed at 124.27 yen, up from 124.15 yen on Wednesday.
   One British pound cost $1.8990 in the British capital, slightly
more expensive for buyers than $1.8930 late Wednesday. In New York
it cost $1.8973 to buy one pound, more expensive than Wednesday's
$1.89125.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.66715 West German marks, up from
1.66485; 1.37675 Swiss francs, up from 1.3764; 5.6605 French
francs, up from 5.6540; 1,238.625 Italian lire, up from 1,237.875,
and 1.23505 Canadian dollars, up from 1.22905.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.6660 West German marks, up from 1.6635; 1.3755 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3745; 5.6550 French francs, up from 5.6490;
1.8675 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8630; 1,238.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,234.50; and 1.2329 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2283.
   Gold prices fell. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold closed
at $455.40 a troy ounce, down from $457 an ounce Wednesday.
   In London, gold was quoted at a bid price of $454.50 a troy
ounce late Thursday, compared with late Wednesday's bid price of
$456.50. In Zurich, the bid price was $454.50, down from $457.50
late Wednesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.04 to close at
a bid $454.90.
   Silver finished at $6.450 a troy ounce on New York's Comex, up
from $6.439 on Wednesday. In London, the metal was quoted at a bid
price of $6.46 a troy ounce, unchanged from late Wednesday.

   A sharp afternoon selloff wiped out an early
gain in the stock market Thursday, leaving prices little changed
from the day before.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 30 points
at its midsession peak, closed with a 1.99 gain at 1,987.40.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 6 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 688 up, 801 down and 501 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 168.44 million shares, against 147.59
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index edged
up .10 to 145.23.
   Analysts said swings in prices of stock-index futures prompted
professionals engaged in program trading to sell the futures and
buy individual stocks in the early going.
   At midafternoon, they said, the balance abruptly reversed and
selling programs hit the stock market.
   Brokers said the effect was especially pronounced because many
other investors have been shying away from the stock market lately,
and thus contributing to its potential volatility.
   They noted that many stocks haven't responded much so far to
generally strong earnings reports for the first quarter.
   For all its erratic behavior, the Dow Jones industrial average
was able to break a three-session losing streak during which it
fell 28.52 points.
   Observers noted, however, that many investors were still in a
very touchy mood a week after the Dow took a 101.46-point drop on
April 14.
   Texas Instruments fell 2} to 46{ in active trading. Analysts
cited disappointment over some aspects of the company's financial
results for the first quarter.
   Among other prominent computer and technology issues, Digital
Equipment dropped 1] to 99|, and International Business Machines
lost { to 112].
   By contrast, Tandy climbed 2| to 45}. The company introduced its
version of a line of IBM personal computers.
   A few issues did benefit from positive earnings reports. For
example, Clark Equipment, which posted a profit in the first
quarter against a loss in the like period a year ago, jumped 2{ to
30].
   Schlumberger added { to 36{ with a boost from sharply higher
quarterly earnings.
   Gillette gained 1{ to 41} as traders awaited the outcome of a
proxy fight between the company and Coniston Partners for four
seats on the Gillette board of directors.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $1.74 billion, or 0.07
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 194.56 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose .33 to 298.66,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up .29 at 256.42.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 1.04 to 373.20. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 296.71, down 1.01.

<HEAD>URGENT
^Eds: New with bill passing.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House today passed sweeping trade
legislation, ignoring fresh veto threats from President Reagan and
defiantly upholding the measure's embattled plant closings
provisions.
   ``Our future is not in the past,'' House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, said as he urged approval of the bill with the plant
closings feature intact. ``We can regain our competitiveness ... We
can be No. 1 again.''
   The bill passed by a vote of 312-107.
   President Reagan, on the road in Massachusetts, said he would
veto the legislation if it arrived on his desk with the plant
closings provision included in it.
   He also sent a letter to House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel,
R-Ill., saying, ``I want a trade bill.''
   ``I will work vigorously to secure one,'' Reagan said. ``And I
will urge the leadership to schedule prompt action on a bill
immediately after Congress sustains my forthcoming veto'' of the
current trade bill.
   The House rejected 253-167 a move by Michel to return the trade
bill to a House-Senate conference committee with orders to drop the
plant closings provision.
   Critics of the provision warned that it would not only trigger a
veto but that if it went into law it would cripple American
business by drying up capital for investment, frightening off
customers and causing other problems.
   The measure would require all but the smallest employers to
provide 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   The provision completely overshadowed the centerpiece features
of the legislation which would streamline the system under which
the United States imposes import curbs to aid industries threatened
by foreign competition and retaliate against international trade
violations.
   Scores of other features range from repeal of the windfall
profits tax on oil companies to billions of dollars in agricultural
subsidies.
   Republicans portrayed the measure as doomed to a veto with the
plant closings provision still part of it.
   ``I'm more interested in plant openings than plant closings,''
said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
   ``We can exorcise this demon,'' said Rep. William Frenzel,
R-Minn.
   The legislation would overhaul the system under which the
government retaliates against international trade violations and
uses import curbs to aid American industries hurt by surging
foreign competition.
   These provisions have figured little in battles over the bill in
recent weeks, however. The White House has issued numerous threats
of a presidential veto if the plant-closings provisions remain.
   Efforts to whisk the bill through the House Rules Committee on
Wednesday were stalled for hours over Democratic concerns that
Michel would muster the strength on the floor to send the measure
back to the committee.
   ``It is my hope that through this motion we will be able to get
a trade bill that can actually be enacted into law,'' Michel said
after the Rules Committee cleared the way for him to go ahead with
his plan.
   The idea of a veto over plant closings is proving less than
appetizing to lawmakers with a host of narrow election-year items
tucked into the trade bill, ranging from repeal of the windfall
profits tax on oil companies to billions of dollars in agricultural
subsidies.
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III came to Capitol Hill on
Wednesday to try to rally Republican House members to oppose the
measure if the measures on plant closings remained in.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Wednesday
the administration was ``pessimistic'' about chances that lawmakers
would send the president legislation he would sign.
   ``I would say we are not too optimistic at this point,''
Fitzwater said. ``The indications have been that the Congress is
not going to relent on plant closings as well as some of the other
provisions, so I would say that we are pretty pessimistic that we
will get a bill that we could sign.''

<NOTE>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund
Report are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the
week ended Wednesday.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 421 money market mutual
funds fell $850.6 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline to $273.93 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $2.02 billion drop in the funds' assets the
previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 210 general purpose funds rose $1.01 billion to $83.24
billion while assets of 97 broker-dealer funds rose 246.1 million
to $117.55 billion.
   But the trade group said assets of 114 institutional funds fell
$2.10 billion to $73.14 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds slipped
in the week ended Tuesday to 6.09 percent from 6.10 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield edged up to 6.07 percent from 6.06
percent, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
41 days, down from 42 days the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
5.68 percent as of Wednesday from 5.67 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.13 percent from 5.14 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 6.85
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 6.82 percent
the previous week. Yields were 7.17 percent on 1-year CDs, up from
7.14 percent; 7.59 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.57 percent;
and 8.04 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.01 percent.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Fall With Rain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply Thursday on the Chicago
Board of Trade as rain dampened the dry fields of the western Corn
Belt and the South American soybean harvest accelerated. Grains
also finished lower.
   On other markets, energy futures advanced; stock-index futures
plunged; precious metals were mixed; and livestock and meat futures
were mixed.
   Rain in western Iowa and Nebraska, where spring planting has
just begun, melted fears that dry conditions would delay
germination of seeds, analysts said.
   Soybean prices came under additional pressure from the Brazilian
soybean harvest, now more than 50 percent complete, and the
beginning of the Argentine soybean harvest, said Richard Loewy,
senior grain and oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc in New York.
   ``They should be 80 to 85 percent finished in May,'' he said of
the South American harvest. ``Then our crush and export rate will
tail off, and you don't get as much domestic meal feeding anyway as
we get into the warmer weather.''
   Further pressure on the soy complex came from an American
Soybean Association statement that it did not expect the
Agriculture Department to offer the Soviet Union 170,000 metric
tons of U.S. soybean oil under its Export Enhancement Program,
Loewy said.
   Wheat settled { cent to 1 cent lower with the contract for
delivery in May at $3.14} a bushel; corn was 1} cents to 2\ cents
lower with May at $2.02\ a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 3{ cents
lower with May at $1.63\ a bushel; soybeans were 7\ cents to 11
cents lower with May at $6.59{ a bushel.
   Energy futures staged a broad rally on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on reports that seven non-OPEC countries would meet with
OPEC's price committee next week in Venice to discuss production
cuts.
   ``It seems the announcement and confirmation that the cartel
would be meeting with non-OPEC producers was a very positive
sign,'' said Nauman Barakat of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 36 cents to 38 cents
higher with June at $18.36 a barrel; heating oil was .76 cent to
1.23 cents higher with May at 50.54 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .70 cent to 1.03 cents higher with May at 52.45 cents
a gallon.
   Stock-index futures plunged late in the afternoon on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange on news that the federal budget deficit for
March was a lower-than-expected $29 billion, analysts said.
   ``It was just like the good old days, very volatile,'' said John
Mitchell, executive director of financial futures for Elders
Futures Inc. in Chicago, referring to the relative calm in futures
trading since the stock market crash.
   Technically-based selling accelerated the dive, he said.
   The contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 1.7 points lower at 256.20.
   Gold futures finished modestly lower on the Commodity Exchange
in New York, basically following the lead of platinum futures,
which posted steeper losses, analysts said. Silver was marginally
higher.
   The markets reflected concerns that the Federal Reserve wants to
force interest rates higher to bring in more foreign investors to
prop up the dollar and ward off a recession, said Jack Barbanel, an
analyst with Gruntal & Co. in New York.
   Recession fears have been absent recently from the metals
markets, which have generally been trading higher on expecations of
increased inflation.
   But Barbanel said traditional indicators of inflation _ such as
widespread price increases for goods and services _ have not
surfaced.
   ``One has to seriously question this whole idea about
inflation,'' he said. ``The Fed may be using inflation as a
scapegoat to say we have to tighten money and get the interest
rates up higher.''
   Platinum settled $5.40 to $5.90 lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange with July at $526.70 a troy ounce. On the Comex, gold was
$1.60 to $2.20 lower with June at $457.20 a troy ounce; silver was
1 cent higher across the board with May at $6.46 a troy ounce.
   Cattle futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in
position-evening ahead of two USDA cattle-on-feed reports due out
after Friday's close.
   Analysts expect the monthly seven-state and quarterly 13-state
reports to show active placement of cattle onto feedlots, but only
moderate marketings, which would translate into greater cattle
supplies in coming months.
   Pork futures finished mostly lower on lower cash prices, said
Tom Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. of Arlington
Heights, Ill.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent lower to .60 cent higher with June
at 70.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .10
cent higher with April at 79.40 cents a pound; hogs were .50 cent
lower to .25 cent higher with June at 48.85 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .28 cent lower to .05 cent higher with May at
53.12 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Tandy Announces Fast PC And Breakthrough Compact Disk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tandy Corp. stepped up in the big leagues of
both personal computing and music Thursday with a fast new PC and a
new kind of re-recordable compact disk.
   Analysts said both announcements demonstrated the evolution of
Fort Worth, Texas-based Tandy as a leader in technology.
   ``These guys are changing their image from being just a retailer
to being an innovator,'' said Clifford Friedman, an analyst with
C.J. Lawrence Inc.
   Tandy stock rose $2.62{ a share to $45.75 a share in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   The new personal computer is due for volume shipments in July
and is likely to be the first on the market that follows the design
of International Business Machines Corp.'s year-old Personal
System-2.
   Dell Computer Corp. of Austin, Texas, announced a
PS-2-compatible machine on Monday, but said it would not be
available until the final quarter of 1988. Tandy's version has
technological advantages over IBM's own computer.
   While a new personal computer was widely expected, Tandy pulled
a surprise with its announcement of an unusual compact disk that
can be repeatedly erased and re-recorded.
   Tandy said the compact disk, known as the Thor CD, would have
the advantages of huge storage capacity and high fidelity without
the disadvantage of being unalterable.
   It will be available for music in 1{ to two years and for data
about a year after that, once recording and playback devices are
built, Tandy said. The Thor CD could also be played _ although not
recorded on _ in standard compact disk players.
   Tandy will make Thor CD equipment and license other companies to
make it and expects that some day the invention might yield the
company ``hundreds of millions of dollars'' a year in additional
profits from sales and royalties, John Roach, Tandy's chairman and
chief executive, said at a New York news conference.
   The announcement drew a critical response from the Recording
Industry Association of America because it would allow people to
make high-quality recordings of commercial compact disks at home.
The group has been battling against digital audio tape, another
technology that is ideal for copying.
   ``We're always concerned about technologies that threaten to
enable consumers to infringe on copyrights,'' said spokeswoman
Trish Heimers.
   Indeed, opposition from the recording industry might hold up the
Tandy invention, said Leonard Laub, president of Vision Three Inc.,
a New York-based consulting firm.
   As with music, the Thor CD would allow computer users to create
their own data libraries.
   On its new Tandy 5000 MC personal computer, Tandy tried to
assure potential customers that the machine would not be knocked
down by a patent lawsuit by IBM.
   The company said the computer was covered by an existing patent
cross-licensing agreement with IBM, although it said certain PS-2
patents that may be issued to IBM in the future are still subject
to negotiations.
   Analysts are betting that IBM will not try to block Tandy. They
say Tandy's quality is high enough that IBM won't be embarrassed by
shoddy goods. And they say the companies are not direct
competitors, with IBM focusing on the Fortune 1000 and Tandy
focusing on what it calls the ``Unfortunate 6 Million'' small and
medium-sized companies.
   In addition, some big IBM customers have been telling IBM they
would feel more comfortable buying the Personal System-2 if they
knew there was another company that could serve as a second source
for the product.
   Tandy seems to have shaken off its image as a company for
hobbyists, tinkerers and bargain hunters.
   ``Tandy is a class-act company,'' said Esther Dyson, editor of
Release 1.0, a computer newsletter.
   The suggested price for one popular configuration of the Tandy
5000 MC with a 40-megabyte hard disk drive is $6,499, compared to
$6,995 for IBM's PS-2 Model 80 with a 44-megabyte hard disk drive.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All three of the Federal Reserve Board's
measures of the nation's money supply rose in early April, the
central bank said Thursday.
   The Fed said its narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose
$1.1 billion to a seasonally adjusted $766.2 billion in the week
ended April 11 from $765.1 billion the previous week.
   The central bank said the measure known as M2 rose $7.8 billion
to a seasonally adjusted $2,991.2 billion from $2,983.4 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased $3.7 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,756.6 billion from $3,752.9 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $1.36 billion in
the week ended April 13 compared with a gain of $1.76 billion the
previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System averaged $515 million a day in the week ended
Wednesday, up from $167 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $275.3 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $274.0 billion two weeks earlier.

   Both Gillette Co. and the investor group
battling to win four seats on its board hinted at victory Thursday
as the scramble for shareholder votes gave way to the ballot count
that will determine the winner.
   Shareholder proxy ballots were filed Thursday at Gillette's
annual meeting, a key step in the four-month effort by Coniston
Group force a sale or merger of the Boston-based personal products
company.
   Although preliminary results are not expected for at least a
week, both Coniston principals and Gillette executives expressed
optimism they would prevail.
   ``Obviously, we think we will win,'' Coniston principal Augustus
K. Oliver said after the three-hour annual meeting at which several
shareholders drew applause for criticizing New York-based Coniston.
``We think we're ahead and we're looking forward to the results.''
   Although Coniston would control only one-third of the board if
successful, Oliver said a Coniston victory would constitute a
shareholder mandate for the group's agenda.
   Colman M. Mockler Jr., Gillette's chairman and chief executive,
declined to give specific projections but stated: ``We are pleased
with the results so far.''
   Gillette rose $1.50 to $41.75 a share in composite New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   The contest likely will be decided by institutional investors,
such as pension funds and insurance companies, which own between 60
percent to 65 percent of the 115.5 million Gillette shares
outstanding.
   Coniston controls 6.76 million Gillette shares, about 5.8
percent of the company's shares outstanding. Coniston also claims
to have the support of several major shareholders.
   Since early March, both sides have been battling in the courts
and the press while seeking support from the company's nearly
27,000 shareholders.
   In a final presentation at Thursday's meeting, Coniston
principal Paul E. Tierney Jr. told nearly 800 shareholders their
investments would produce large financial dividends through the
sale of Gillette's corporate empire.
   Tierney also said Coniston would remove provisions designed to
shield the company from takeovers and to protect top management
posts.
   Oliver said the group seeks to sell the company as a whole
entity, except for the possible divestment of some divisions. In
the meantime, he pledged to devote more corporate resources to
research and development and product marketing.
   Oliver said no potential buyers have approached Coniston so far,
although he indicated the group would consider a proposal by Revlon
Group Inc. Revlon in November 1986 abandoned repeated attempts to
take over Gillette after receiving a nearly $580 million stock
repurchase, and signed a 10-year pact not to seek control of the
company.
   Mockler, one of the directors whose seat is being challenged,
denied published reports that six suitors hade signed an agreement
to purchase the company.
   Mockler and other Gillette officers gave presentations stressing
the company's worldwide growth and increased profitability since
its restructuring and dismissal of 2,400 workers after signing the
Revlon pact. No mention was made of plans to close plants or
further reduce its 30,000-member workforce.
   In addition to the proxy fight, Gillette and Coniston are
entangled in legal battles. Gillette is attempting to have the
results of the shareholder vote invalidated, and Coniston has sued
Gillette for allegedly using false and misleading information in
its campaign to win shareholder votes.
   Coniston nominated Oliver, Tierney, Coniston principal Keith R.
Gollust and former cable television executive David Strassler for
three-year director posts.
   In addition to Mockler, the company placed Gillette directors
Lawrence E. Fouraker, Herbert H. Jacobi and Joseph F. Turley on the
ballot.

   Compaq Computer Corp.'s profit rose 132 percent and its revenue
rose 108 percent in the latest quarter, the mushrooming maker of
personal computers said Thursday.
   Among other technology companies, semiconductor maker Texas
Instruments Inc. of Dallas said its profit fell 4.9 percent and
minicomputer maker Data General Corp. of Westboro, Mass., said it
made a profit in contrast to a year-earlier loss.
   Texas Instruments announced separately that Jerry R. Junkins
will take on the title of chairman upon the retirement of Mark
Shepherd Jr., which was previously announced. Junkins is already
president and chief executive.
   Compaq, which reached the Fortune 500 and the $1 billion annual
sales mark faster than any other company, continued to skyrocket in
the first quarter.
   The Houston-based company attributed the gains to international
market growth, a strong brand image and sales of its
top-of-the-line products, including the Deskpro 386-20.
   Compaq's profit rose to $47 million, or $1.21 a share, from $20
million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $439
million from $211 million.
   Texas Instruments, which makes computer chips, defense
electronics and other products, said its profit fell to $85.5
million, or 95 cents a share, from $89.9 million, or $1.12 a share,
a year earlier. Revenue rose 15.4 percent to $1.47 billion from
$1.27 billion.
   Data General said net income for its second fiscal quarter
totaled $17.2 million, or 57 cents a share, a reversal from a $42.6
million loss in the same period last year. The computer maker
reported revenues of $349.7 million, a 10.9 percent increase over
last year's $315.2 million.
   The company attributed part of the rise to the $5.9 million sale
of a company facility in Austin, Texas, during the quarter.
   For the six-month period ending March 26, Data General reported
net income of $29.6 million, or $1.01 a share, compared with a net
loss of $39.3 million in the same period a year earlier. Revenue
rose 10.2 percent to $692.5 million from $628.5 million.

   Corn syrup maker Staley Continental
Inc. rejected as inadequate a $1.33 billion takeover bid from a
British company Thursday but indicated it might entertain a better
offer.
   Tate & Lyle PLC, which made the $32-a-share cash tender offer
April 8, declined comment on Staley's decision but one analyst said
he expected the British sugar refiner to increase its bid.
   Tate & Lyle did announce it has arranged a $1.3 billion loan
agreement wiht a group of 14 banks to finance a takeover.
   Staley stock rose 75 cents to $37.50 a share in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
   Staley, the nation's second-largest refiner of corn sweeteners,
said it would consider various alternatives for enhancing
shareholder value. The options include a financial restructuring or
recapitalization, issuing stock to a third party, selling all or
part of the company, a joint venture or a leveraged buyout, Staley
Chairman Donald E. Nordlund said in a letter to stockholders.
   Spokesman David Satterfield said Staley had held discussions
with at least one other party but added that the company wanted to
remain independent.
   ``I think the board has asked management to look at all the
various alternatives because as part of its fiduciary
responsibility they've got to be able to make the best judgment
possible for shareholders,'' Satterfield said.
   One option likely to present itself is a higher offer from Tate
& Lyle, said John M. McMillan, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``I think they officially put the `for sale' sign on the
company,'' McMillan said. ``But from a shareholder's point of view,
they said all the right things: That they're contemplating
alternative moves designed to enhance the value of Staley's stock
beyond the $32 that Tate and Lyle offered.''
   McMillan said Staley probably was worth about $40 a share. But
he said he doubted a bidding war would develop.
   ``I don't think there's a line of bidders that want to get into
the U.S. sweetener industry,'' he said. ``It's a competitive market
and it takes special managerial skills.''
   Tate & Lyle is Britain's second-largest sugar refiner. An
acquisition of Staley would give it a foothold in the U.S. corn
sweetener market and make it the only supplier of all three types
of sugar _ corn, beet and cane _ in the United States.
   Tate & Lyle's owns nearly 5 percent of Staley's 30.4 million
outstanding shares of common stock and is offering to buy all
outstanding shares of all classes of stock in a deal it valued at
$1.33 billion.
   Tate & Lyle's chairman, Neil M. Shaw, has said he would move the
company's headquarters from suburban Chicago back to Decatur, the
site of Staley's largest corn-processing plant and the company's
home until three years ago.
   Staley Continental is a holding company formed in early 1985 for
the A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co. and CFS Continental Inc., a
food-service supplier.

<HEAD>House Passes Trade Bill by Wide Margin Despite Veto Threat</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 5th graf pvs, bgng: The bill, to show it is a product of
House-Senate conference committee</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Thursday passed a sweeping trade
bill, delivering a sharp blow to President Reagan as supporters of
the hotly disputed measure piled up enough votes to override his
threatened veto.
   ``Our future isn't in the past,'' House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, declared as he fought a move to return the bill to a
House-Senate conference committee and drop a plant-closings
provision that Reagan said he could not approve. ``We can regain
our competitiveness. ... We can be No.1 again.''
   The final tally, 312-107, contradicted numerous forecasts that
the bill's sponsors would fail to produce the two-thirds vote
needed to override a veto.
   But many lawmakers, even if they had their doubts, appeared to
have no taste in an election year for going on record against a
measure billed as a plan to upgrade American competitiveness.
   The bill was a House-Senate compromise on two competing measures
that passed both chambers last year. The measure now goes to the
Senate, where Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., planned to
begin debate Friday. He was shooting for a vote on final passage
early next week.
   The House passed the measure after defeating, 253-167, a move by
Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., to throw the bill back to
the conference committee and drop the plant-closings provision.
   Reagan, on the road in Massachusetts, said he would veto the
bill if it came to him with the plant-closings provision intact. He
also sent a letter to Michel, saying, ``I want a trade bill.''
   ``I will work vigorously to secure one,'' Reagan said. ``And I
will urge the leadership to schedule prompt action on a bill
immediately after the Congress sustains my forthcoming veto'' of
the current trade bill.
   Controversy over the plant-closings provision overshadowed
central features of the bill, which would streamline the way the
United States imposes import curbs to aid U.S. industries and
retaliate against international trade violations.
   Scores of other provisions ranged from repeal of the windfall
profits tax to billions of dollars in agricultural subsidies.
   Dueling over plant closings provision went on almost to the last
minute.
   ``I am more interested in plant openings than plant closings,''
said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
   However, Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., said it would be a
mistake to allow such an important measure to become hung up on one
provision. ``It is so modest, so watered down, so full of
exceptions'' that it probably will not have as much effect as
lawmakers intended, he said.
   Debate focused heavily on the provision that would require all
but the smallest employers to give 60-day notice of upcoming plant
closings and large-scale layoffs. The measure contains a number of
exceptions for companies that sudenly find themselves in an
emergency.
   The centerpiece provisions would streamline the system under
which the United States imposes import curbs and other means to aid
industries threatened by foreign competition and retaliate against
international trade violatrions.
   Scores of other provisions range from repeal of the windfall
profits tax on oil companies to billions of dollars in new
agricultural subsidies.
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., said the bill for the first time ``establishes a policy
that will make America a winner in international competitive
markets.''
   But Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., whose amendment to roll
back Japanese trade surpluses was dropped earlier, said the measure
did not go far enough in forcing open foreign markets.
   Rep. Edward R. Madigan, R-Ill., said that with the ink barely
dry he had discovered that the 1,000-page bill would increase the
amount of Caribbean ethanol allowed in duty-free.
   ``I thought we were going to try to create jobs, I thought we
were going to create markets,'' Madigan said. ``But here we are
trying to give away some of our own jobs and give away some of our
own markets, just exactly the oppsosite of what we said we were
trying to do.''
   But Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., said ``This bill will put pressure
on our trading competitors to open up their markets and play fairly
and squarely with the trading system that we already have.''
   Republican critics of the plant-closings provision cited
business fears that plant-closings notice would reduce credit,
frighten customers, cut productivity and perhaps lead to sabotage
among disappointed employees facing layoffs. They also said it had
no direct connection with the trade issue.

<HEAD>NBC Employee Survey Finds Anxiety About GE</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of NBC employees are skeptical of
General Electric Co.'s commitment to continue ownership of the
network, according to results of a survey conducted by NBC and
described in a letter sent to employees by NBC President Robert C.
Wright on Thursday.
   ``GE is viewed with skepticism and uncertainty. More employees
feel that GE will not continue its NBC ownership, even with NBC
performing well, than believe GE will be around for the long
haul,'' Wright said.
   He said even more employees believe GE will not allow NBC to
operate independently, and many don't like the effect the new
corporate owner has had on their working environment.
   GE, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., acquired NBC in 1986 as
part of its purchase of the RCA Corp., based in New York. Wright
was a GE executive before taking over as NBC president and chief
executive officer.
   A ``high percentage'' of employees do not feel their jobs are
secure, Wright said. Nevertheless, he said, they feel better off
than people in similar jobs in other areas of the industry.
   ``While almost half of the employees say they are not encouraged
by the direction they see NBC taking today, a majority of employees
say they are not likely to leave the company because of
dissatisfaction,'' Wright said in the letter.
   ``All of this anxiety is understandable,'' he wrote.
   ``Change is always stressful and the vast changes that are
taking place in the broadcasting business have understandably
resulted in considerable employee anxiety and insecurity. The
survey clearly reflects this.''
   Nonetheless, Wright said most employees said they were happy
with their jobs and a majority were felt their salaries compared
favorably to the rest of the industry.
   Wright concluded the letter by assuring employees that ``you
have been heard.'' He said next month employees would be asked to
participate in discussions of problems mentioned in the survey.
   ``Creating an atmosphere in which we can go forward with far
less doubt about NBC's goals and intentions is the first priority
of our management team for the coming year,'' Wright said.

<HEAD>Radiologist Couple Settles Insider Trading Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former New Jersey bank director and her
husband have settled insider trading charges by paying more than
$1.25 million in profits and fines to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the SEC said Thursday.
   The commission said Rita Leone and Armand Leone Sr.,
radiologists from Franklin Lakes, N.J., surrendered the money
without admitting or denying the allegations, which stem from her
former position as a director in now defunct First Jersey National
Corp., acquired by National Westminster USA last year.
   The couple agreed to pay $774,302 in profits from the trades and
a one-time penalty of $480,916 under the Insider Trading Sanctions
Act of 1984, the SEC said in a statement released in New York.
   The SEC alleged that Mrs. Leone, through her privileged position
at the bank, learned last summer of the impending merger with
National Westminster and shared the secret with her husband. He in
turn allegedly leaked it to others, who weren't identified by the
SEC.
   The couple bought thousands of shares of First Jersey National
in the over-the-counter market in the weeks prior to the merger
announcement at a price of about $54 a share, well below the $77
market price when the merger was announced Aug. 5, the SEC alleged.
The final merger price was $82 a share.
   The agency said it investigated after the surveillance
department of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which
monitors over-the-counter trading, noticed unusually heavy trading
activity in First Jersey National prior to the merger announcement.
   National Westminster is the U.S. subsidiary of National
Westminister Bank PLC. Its acquisition of First Jersey created a
$15.8 billion bank holding company with 250 branches in New Jersey,
New York and the metropolitan area.

   Union Carbide Corp. on Thursday reported
its first-quarter profit rose 53 percent because of increased
volume, higher selling prices and relatively stable raw material
prices in the chemicals and plastics business.
   The Danbury-based chemical giant reported net income was $101
million, or 75 cents a share, for the first quarter from $66
million, or 51 cents a share, in the same period in 1987.
   The company said sales for the quarter rose 16 percent to $1.95
billion from $1.6 billion in the same period last year.
   The current upswing in the chemicals and plastics industry is
unprecedented in recent times because it is not driven by an energy
crisis, high inflation, or major inventory building, said Chairman
Robert D. Kennedy.

<HEAD>First Chicago To Buy Part Of Continental's Chicago Retail
Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First National Bank of Chicago said Thursday it
would acquire downtown Chicago portions of Continental Illinois
National Bank and Trust Co.'s retail banking business.
   Terms of the definitive agreement signed Thursday were not
disclosed.
   The sale will result in the transfer to First Chicago of
consumer deposits now totaling $579 million and outstanding
consumer loan balances totaling $101 million, First Chicago stated.
   About 88,000 Continental retail banking accounts will be
included in the sale, which is subject to regulatory approval.
   First Chicago said Continental customers affected by the sale
are being notified and will not have to many any change in their
accounts.
   Continental Illinois Chairman Thomas C. Theobald said the sale
of the retail operations was part of his company's strategy of
concentrating on its business and private banking operations.
   First Chicago Chairman Barry F. Sullivan said in a news release:
``This is a good strategic move for both organizations. It provides
the opportunity for First Chicago to add these accounts,
efficiently expanding our consumer banking customer base and
complementing our 1987 acquisition of First United Financial
Services Inc., and our pending purchase of Gary-Wheaton
Corporation.''
   First Chicago also has agreed in principle to lease
Continental's retail banking center at Clark and Division streets
in Chicago.
   Thursday's agreement includes most of Continental's retail
checking accounts, regular savings and money market accounts,
student loans and lines of credit, including home equity lines. It
also also covers certificates of deposit that are linked to other
accounts being transferred and secured and unsecured consumer
installment loans.
   Continental Illinois Corp., Continental Illinois National Bank
and Trust Co.'s holding company, posted a $610 million net loss
last year, its worst since since 1984.
   In 1984, Continental needed a $4.5 billion government bailout to
survive an unprecedented run on its deposits.

   The U.S. dollar rose marginally against the
Japanese yen in morning trading on Friday, while stock prices
posted moderate gains in light activity.
   The dollar opened at 124.29 yen, almost unchanged from its close
Thursday of 124.30, and edged up slightly. At midmorning it was
changing hands at 124.40 yen.
   An exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo said a
lack of fresh news kept the dollar stable in early foreign exchange
activity. Trading also was uneventful on overseas markets, which
close before the Tokyo exchange opens.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, down 35.93 points on Thursday, gained 51.34 to
close the morning session at 26,879.50.
   ``Overnight stability on overseas stock markets and the
relatively stable yen-dollar exchange rates combined to fuel a
moderate advance,'' said Seiichiro Kita of Daiwa Securities Co., a
major Japanese brokerage.
   Kita said some market participants were taking a cautious
position because of uncertainty over prospects for U.S. interest
rates, ``but otherwise the market's firmness will continue.''

<HEAD>USG To Let Shareholders Vote On Lowering Takeover Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USG Corp. said Wednesday it would allow its
stockholders to decide whether the company should drop its
``poison-pill'' takeover defense, which is a major impediment to a
Texas group's $1.63 billion takeover attempt.
   But USG said the offer was conditioned on the willingness of the
investor group, Desert Partners L.P., to extend the deadline for
its takeover bid, a provision criticized by Desert Partners.
   Desert Partners's offer of $42 a share cash for 85 percent of
USG's stock has been spurned as inadequate by the company, a maker
of building materials.
   USG's poison pill seeks to make a hostile takeover prohibitively
expensive by allowing management to issue more shares if a bidder
acquires more than 20 percent of the company's stock.
   Desert Partners, which owns about 9.8 percent of USG's
outstanding stock, repeatedly has called on USG to rescind the
poison pill, and issued a statement that it was pleased USG was
putting the issue to a shareholder vote.
   However, the group criticized USG's request for it to extend its
offer through June 16 from its current expiration on Friday. Desert
Partners said USG provided no assurance that it would refrain from
taking other defensive moves during that time.
   ``The partnership reiterated that it is willing to negotiate all
aspects of its offer, including price,'' the statement concluded.
   Efforts to reach Desert Partners for further comment beyond the
statement were unsuccessful and a message was not immediately
returned after business hours late Wednesday.
   USG announced late Wednesday that it would submit the
poison-pill question to a special shareholder vote on June 6 if
Desert Partners extended its tender offer to June 16.
   If 85 percent of USG shareholders voted to rescind the poison
pill, USG would do so by June 16, stated Robert J. Day, USG
chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``The USG Board has previously concluded that the Desert
Partners' offer is wholly inadequate, coercive and not in the best
interests of USG and its stockholders,'' Day said.
   ``We believe that by submitting the rights plan to a stockholder
vote in a free, non-coercive atmosphere, the stockholder vote will
support the board's conclusion,'' he said.
   Desert Partners, which is controlled by oilmen Jack Brown and
Cyril Wagner Jr. of Midland, Texas, also is trying to circumvent
the poison pill by waging a proxy fight to fill six spots on USG's
15-member board of directors at the company's May 11 annual meeting.
