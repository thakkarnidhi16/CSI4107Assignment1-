<HEAD>Infrastructure Problems Loom For Los Angeles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's second-largest city, with its
promised-land image of youth and opportunity, is starting to show
its age. The effects of too many years of too much growth are
increasingly evident in Los Angeles' streets and freeways, sewers
and landfills.
   While in many U.S. cities the challenge is just to replace
public works as they wear out, Los Angeles faces the added
pressures of California-style growth.
   The stress has occasionally popped the city's overworked sewer
system, causing raw sewage discharges into the Pacific Ocean and
prompting Mayor Tom Bradley last fall to propose restrictions on
the number of new sewer hookups.
   On the region's streets and freeways, daily trips will increase
42 percent by the year 2010, according to a local planning agency.
Motorists' average speed of 31 mph systemwide today is expected to
drop to 11 mph.
   And without more landfills, city and county officials say Los
Angeles will produce thousands of tons more garbage daily than it
can properly dispose.
   ``Our infrastructure has reached the point that it requires
massive infusions of resources to maintain, or to increase its
capacity to deal with the population growth,'' said Edward J.
Avila, president of the city's Board of Public Works.
   ``I think Los Angeles has been lulled into a false sense of
security,'' said Delwin A. Biagi, an engineer who joined the city's
public works department 17 years ago and who now heads the bureau
of sanitation.
   The city population is expected to swell 16 percent, to 3.6
million, by 2010, according to the Southern California Association
of Governments. In the surrounding six-county area, the predicted
growth is 47 percent, to 18.3 million people in 22 years.
   ``Over the next 25 years, we see a 50 percent increase in
housing and jobs in the Los Angeles area,'' said Roger Riga, a SCAG
transportation planner. ``That means it's going to cause some big
problems with our transportation system. It's already overburdened.
We know that. The question is what are we going to do about it?''
   Riga's agency, which predicted the growth in traffic, also
prepared a study in February that sets out three alternatives,
ranging in cost from $42 million to $110 million, to alleviate
congestion: by locating jobs nearer to housing through growth
management, or changing driving patterns by carpooling or
re-scheduling office hours, or constructing new highways and other
facilities.
   However, California Department of Transportation officials say
the problems are so intractable that doubling the number of
freeways would not appreciably reduce traffic.
   Moreover, a statewide study done by the Governor's
Infrastructure Review Task Force indicates the pricetag would be
billions _ not millions _ of dollars. The task force estimated the
state's public works needs at $78 billion _ and projected a revenue
shortfall of $50 billion to meet the demand.
   Increasing traffic and other effects of growth have stoked the
political fires of Los Angeles' anti-growth movement, said Laura
Lake, an adjunct faculty member at UCLA's School of Public Health,
who heads a group called Not Yet New York.
   ``All the people who support slow-growth want to make sure that
the infrastructure will still be there,'' Ms. Lake said. ``The
system is hemorrhaging and they're coming up with very expensive
Band-Aids.''
   Her group supported City Council candidate Ruth Galanter last
year, and the growth-control advocate was elected. Ms. Lake herself
plans to run for a council seat in 1989.
   Local concerns reflect a nationwide problem.
   Last August, a study of public works funding done for the U.S.
Senate concluded: ``As the federal government shifted priorities
away from infrastructure financing, new federal laws have mandated
state and local compliance with new requirements for water
pollution control, clean drinking water and the cleanup of
hazardous wastes.''
   Another federal study concluded that as much as $90 billion a
year is needed to pay for all types of public works repairs
nationwide.
   The problems it identified _ neglected and dilapidated bridges,
water systems, highways, mass transit systems and other facilities
_ are consistent with what is happening in Los Angeles County,
Supervisor Mike Antonovich said recently.
   Yet Los Angeles leaders postponed capital improvements to the
sewer system for more than a decade while arguing over compliance
with federal clean water standards.
   ``The city was running away from its responsibilities,'' said
Dorothy Green, president of an environmental group called Heal the
Bay.
   The dispute ended when the city agreed to stop dumping its
treated sewage sludge offshore and to build a secondary wastewater
treatment facility. The primary wastewater plant was built in 1950.
   The cost of compliance will be more than $2.3 billion over the
next 10 years, officials said.
   Los Angeles also faces a looming crisis over its garbage, which
is thrown away at the rate of 45,000 tons per day in the
metropolitan area, said Mike Miller, manager of the city's solid
waste task force.
   The city itself, which generates 18,000 tons per day of that
total, already trucks 5,400 tons per day to outlying county
landfills, Miller said.
   ``We have to find additional landfill space and we have to start
recycling efforts,'' Miller said. ``That's all we've got.''
   If no landfills are established, the excess garbage will amount
to 6,400 tons per day by 1992, and 50,000 tons per day by the year
2000, Miller said. By 1997, there will be no landfills remaining
within the city.
   ``We haven't been able to site a new landfill since 1974,''
Miller said, listing five ill-fated proposals, including
trash-to-energy incineration plants.
   ``The City Council is very aware of the situation. They just
have no clear-cut plan as to what they're going to do.''

<HEAD>Since AP Series on Abuses, 19 States Move to Change Laws</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in report for Sunday AMs.</NOTE>

   Nineteen states have taken steps to change laws that govern the
guardians who take on the personal and financial affairs of old
people, aiming to close loopholes and prevent abuse of the
elderly's rights.
   Almost all the action has come since publication last fall of
Associated Press stories about shortcomings in the little-known but
powerful system of guardianship, under which hundreds of thousands
of people deemed mentally incompetent have had their affairs turned
over to someone else.
   The series, ``Guardians of the Elderly: An Ailing System,''
which examined guardianship laws from a national viewpoint and in
each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, found a network
of overburdened courts that routinely fail to monitor wards under
their jurisdiction, which often opens the door to physical and
financial mistreatment.
   Legislation to strengthen guardianship protections has been
introduced in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, New
Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. U.S. Rep. Claude Pepper,
D-Fla., has drafted a national reform law.
   In addition, studies of guardianship laws are under way in New
York, Virginia, Mississippi and Illinois, court procedural changes
have been made in Alaska, Pennsylvania and Washington state, and
the Idaho Senate is considering a resolution for a study.
   Five new laws in New Mexico have already provided $755,000 to
set up private guardianship services, adult protective services,
social workers, in-home care and homemaker help for frail elderly
and disabled adults, and a demonstration program for counseling the
elderly on guardianship, Medicaid and nursing home financial issues.
   The Indiana General Assembly this year amended the state
guardianship law based on recommendations from a long-term review
by the Probate Code Study Commission. The changes included
requiring biannual review of a ward's personal status, in addition
to his or her financial reports, and increasing legal
representation for the ward.
   And earlier this month, Utah Gov. Norm Bangerter signed into law
a package of guardianship reforms that was approved unanimously at
the state house.
   The reforms will require, among other things, that proposed
wards receive written notice of guardianship proceedings, that they
be represented in proceedings by attorneys, and that ``clear and
convincing medical evidence'' be provided to prove incapacity in
lieu of such catch-all phrases as ``advanced age'' or
``confinement.''
   Betty Tatham, chairwoman of the 21-member panel that overhauled
Utah's guardianship law, said the task force drew heavily on the
AP's guardianship research, state and national, in identifying
problems with the state's existing law and drafting the new one.
   ``We want the state of Utah to be a good place for retired
people to live. We think that this bill will have a positive impact
on protecting the elderly in our society,'' Bangerter said.
   In Virginia, a House committee earlier this month defeated a
proposal to remove ``advanced age'' from state law as a reason to
place a person under guardianship. Physicians, in general,
disapprove of such terminology, saying that it makes it too easy to
link advanced age with incompetency without other factors
considered.
   But an opponent, Delegate Clinton Miller, argued the change
wasn't needed because Virginia requires expert testimony on the
person's mental or physical incapacity. The AP stories on
guardianship in Virginia, however, found that expert testimony was
often nothing more than a one-paragraph statement from a doctor; in
85 percent of the cases examined, such brief statements were all
that was used to establish incompetency.
   Concerning the states with proposed legislation:
   _ Two bills to amend Arizona guardianship laws received almost
unanimous support in committee but have been delayed by the
impeachment trial of Gov. Evan Mecham. One would require guardians
to file annual reports on the well-being of wards; the other would
remove ``advanced age'' as a reason to declare a person
incapacitated.
   _ California lawmakers said the AP series prompted several new
bills in the state Assembly. They would variously certify
professional guardians, require counties to educate guardians on
their responsibilities and require petitions seeking guardianship
to spell out what the elderly person is capable of doing and what
the guardian would handle.
   _ Colorado Gov. Roy Romer is expected to sign a bill, which he
received March 8, that would require guardians to supervise their
wards more closely. Its sponsors said the legislation was prompted
by the AP state series on Colorado's lack of required review of
guardianship cases.
   _ Both houses in Florida are considering legislation to
dramatically liberalize state guardianship statutes. It would
require more accountability from guardians, attorneys, examining
committees, doctors and courts.
   _ The Michigan Senate is considered two House-passed bills. One
would require legal representation for proposed wards and periodic
judicial review of cases to see if guardianship remains necessary.
The second bill would prohibit nursing homes from requiring
residents to have guardians.
   _ A New Jersey Senate committee has passed a bill that would
require court-appointed attorneys to report every two years on what
they have done for their wards. Other legislation pending in the
Legislature would require annual reports.
   Marie Muhler, who runs the state's year-old public guardian
office, said judges began clamping down after the AP series. ``I
notice now that some courts are putting in strict guidelines for
accounting,'' she said in an interview.
   _ The Ohio Senate may vote in May on its rewritten version of a
House-passed bill overhauling state guardianship laws. The proposal
would limit the definition of ``incompetent'' by removing the term
advanced age and require the appointment of investigators to check
each case of alleged incompetency and explain their rights to the
proposed wards.
   _ An Oklahoma joint conference committee is considering a bill
that would change the state guardianship law to require more
reporting and improve legal representation.
   _ In Pennsylvania, legislation now in committee would refine the
definition of incapacity, provide lawyers for incompetent people
without them and set regular review hearings. The bill's sponsor,
Rep. Allen Kukovich, says similar legislation failed to reach the
assembly floor in recent years, but that this bill has better
chances because of the AP series and the attention it brought to
guardianship.
   Studies of guardianship laws are underway in several states.
   In Virginia, such an overall study continues in the General
Assembly despite the defeat of the proposal to change wording in
the existing law. The study will also cover other protective
services for the elderly and incapacitated.
   The Mississippi Council on Aging and the Cook County Public
Guardian's office in Chicago report they are working on
guardianship improvements. Court officials in Alaska, Washington
state and Pennsylvania say they have made some changes in
guardianship procedures since the AP series.
   A study of New York's guardianship system, called
conservatorship, is ``rather well along,'' and findings may be
available this summer, according to the state's top administrative
judge, Albert Rosenblatt. The study was prompted by the attention
the AP gave the issue, Rosenblatt said.

   Eight years after China's communes began
splitting up and peasants returned to family farming, the 2,670
``farmer-workers'' of Cao Tan State Farm still live and tend crops
collectively.
   They are still organized into pseudo-military work teams and
brigades _ once the basic units of all Chinese agriculture. Like
dairy worker Wu Jinlian who helps monitor milk quality, each has a
strictly assigned role.
   ``I like it and I do it well,'' Miss Wu, 28, said proudly,
expressing disinterest in farming her own small plot like the mass
of Chinese peasants.
   Cao Tan is one of 2,300 state-run farms established in the 1950s
and 1960s in imitation of the huge food factories Stalin created in
the Soviet Union as vanguards of communist agriculture.
   Most of China's state farms were set up in remote border areas
or on reclaimed wasteland, as was Cao Tan, which means ``Grass
Sands.''
   Gou Xingwen, head of the farm's agriculture division, said the
farm site in Xian in arid northwestern China had been a dried
riverbed. ``It's not fertile _ too much sand,'' he said.
   But it produces 20 percent more grain per acre than the average
family farm in the region because of heavy capital investment,
mechanization and guidance from the farm's own small scientific
research laboratory.
   ``About 80 percent of agricultural production is mechanized,''
boasted Gou.
   Although state farms account for only 2.7 percent of China's
farmland, they own nearly 8 percent of the rider tractors in the
country and half the combine harvesters.
   They have become China's main producer of non-staple food items
such as eggs and milk, and lead in agricultural exports.
   Their healthy performance highlights what is wrong with most of
Chinese agriculture.
   By breaking up the communes, China restored the work incentive
to peasants but also brought back the main weakness of traditional
farming, plots too tiny for efficient production, mechanization or
use of advanced scientific techniques.
   The use of tractors and other machines fell, as did investment.
Local governments now sink their funds into collective projects
such as small factories, while peasants tend to use the profits
they control for the first time to build better homes and buy
televisions.
   As a result, agricultural production has stagnated or even _ in
the case of grain _ fallen.
   At the state farms, however, collective control over profits has
ensured steadier levels of investment. Allowed under Deng
Xiaoping's 1978 reform program to retain most of their profits, the
farms have reinvested heavily in equipment and fertilizer.
   They have become showcases of what would be possible in Chinese
agriculture if tractors and technology were more widely used.
   At Cao Tan, for example, the 1,300 cows are fed a scientifically
balanced diet that includes mineral supplements. They are milked by
machines at the rate of one cow every two minutes.
   As a result, milk production is among the highest in the country.
   Ten combines and nearly 100 tractors work the 9,677 acres of
land. The dry sandy soil is treated with twice as much chemical
fertilizer as that of individual farmers nearby, resulting in the
high crop yields.
   The workers at Cao Tan also enjoy a higher standard of living
than most family farmers nearby. They live in brick row houses with
concrete floors and cold water taps, compared to the mud-block
homes and packed dirt floors of nearby villages.
   The average per capita income is 1,270 yuan a year, the
equivalent of $343, more than double the national average for
peasants.
   Cao Tan has made some concessions to the new national policy of
rewarding individual initiative. Instead of paying workers equally
as in the past, work teams now sign contracts with the farm and
team members share bonuses when their production exceeds the
contracted amount.
   Nonetheless, some ambitious Cao Tan ``farmer-workers'' have left
in recent years in hopes of getting rich as individual farmers or
entrepreneurs.
   ``About 20 leave every year,'' Gou said. ``The people who have
ability want to break (the farm) up and leave to go on their own.''
   The talented may leave, but Gou and other farm officials are
convinced the farm will never be broken up because of its most
valuable asset, its machinery.
   ``The machinery is of no use if the farm breaks up. It can't be
used by individual farmers,'' Gou said. He predicted the movement
to break up landholdings has run its course, and China will begin
rebuilding large farms to modernize its agriculture.
   Recent reports in the state-run media indicate a growing number
of officials share that view.
   The Xinhua News Agency and Economic Daily both recently urged a
return to large-scale farming. One mayor was quoted as saying his
town was encouraging families to form farming cooperatives.
   In several counties, families that want to work in factories
have been allowed to lease their cropland to the most skilled
farmers, who accumulate large plots.
   ``Rural development experts are observing the experiments ...
with great interest,'' the China Daily reported.

<HEAD>Tension Marks Once Warm Relations Between Panama, U.S. Military</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Panamanian soldiers still
patrol the Panama Canal side-by-side, but their once warm relations
are strained by the prospect of a confrontation over strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   President Reagan has said the United States will not act like
``a colossus of the North'' and take military action here. But the
Panamanian Defense Forces say if the Americans do, their
U.S.-trained and supplied troops are ready to fight back.
   ``The defense force is prepared,'' said Martin Paz, spokesman
for the 15,000-man force under Noreiga's command.
   Paz says the United States is aggravating tension between the
two forces. Government-owned National Radio daily blasts the United
States and warns of military aggression.
   ``We are seeing a lot of maneuvers, maneuvers which do not
comply with the treaty,'' said Paz. ``It is my impression that they
are doing it to frighten us, to terrorize us.''
   The United States wants Noriega, indicted by U.S. federal grand
juries on drug trafficking charges, to resign and is tightening the
economic screws on the country in support of a citizen's campaign
to oust the general.
   The opposition hopes the Defense Forces will eventually turn on
their discredited commander. Those hopes were raised Saturday when
bankers rejected a government demand for the $70 million remaining
in their vaults and the cash-starved government was unable to make
the Defense Force payroll.
   ``There are growing pockets in the defense forces that are
against Noriega,'' said opposition leader Jose Mulino. ``But we
don't know if they will act.''
   Panama is home to the U.S. Southern Command, headquarters for
all U.S. military activity in Latin America.
   About half the 10,000 U.S. Army, Air Force and Navy personnel
are classified as combat troops. Their air backup includes Corsair
fighters, Blackhawk helicopters and C-130 transport planes.
   Although the Defense Forces, Panama's only armed authority,
outnumbers the Americans, it has virtually no air force.
   But the Defense Forces are not the ragtag affair they were
before the 1977 treaty giving Panama sole control of the canal by
the year 2000.
   Since 1981, the United States has spent more than $100 million
to make Panama capable of defending the canal alone. Military
observers say the Panamanian troops are increasingly effective,
especially the new, 800-man Battallion 2000.
   The Defense Forces carry U.S.-supplied M-16s and wear battle
dress uniforms virtually identical to the Americans. When they
hurled tear gas at striking dockworkers, the grenades were made in
Saltsburg, Pa.
   Enhancing the Defense Forces potential strength are paramilitary
groups loyal to Noriega.
   Observers here believe the 25,000 automatic assault pistols the
Defense Forces tried to buy in the United States this week were for
the paramilitary groups.
   Noriega's former pilot, who recently fled Panama, has said that
16 tons of Cuban arms were delivered to the mountains of Panama for
the general's last stand. Paz refused to comment on the defector's
claim.
   U.S. military aid to Panama was suspended by Congress last year
as the political situation began to deteriorate.
   But under the treaty, U.S. and Panamanian military police still
patrol together, stand side-by-side at the gates of shared bases
and sit on boards that authorize troop movements around the canal.
   ``There's a little tension,'' said one U.S. military policeman
who asked not to be identified. ``But we get along. We're
professionals with a job to do.''
   Until recently they also carried out joint training exercises, a
practice stepped up by Noriega after he took command in 1983.
   Many Panamanian officers are graduates of the U.S. Army School
of the Americas, headquartered in Panama City until it moved to
Fort Benning, Ga., in 1984. Others trained at Fort Leavenworth. One
close Noriega aide is a graduate of West Point.
   Noriega began a massive shake-up of his forces after a failed
coup on March 16. Paz scoffs at the idea of another, larger, more
successful mutiny and says only ``a few who wandered off the
track'' were part of the abortive coup.
   Osvaldo Velasquez, head of Panama's Human Rights Commission,
said the dissidents are being harshly punished. He said 11 arrested
officers have been tortured.
   The Defense Forces have detained U.S. soldiers off their base at
least three times since the failed coup. U.S. officials have
ordered military personnel and their dependents not to go to Panama
City unless necessary.
   Whatever happens to Noriega, U.S. military officials are worried
about whether the Defense Forces and American troops can now
achieve the smooth transition aimed at having Panama take over the
canal in 12 years.

<TEXT>
   Moslem extremists are expected to
increase their influence on the Iranian government during a crucial
parliamentary election next month.
   The April 8 vote also will prepare a new generation of leaders
to take over after the aging Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini dies.
   Hardliners, such as Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, who
has close links to pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants holding
foreign hostages in Lebanon, are expected to make some gains.
   Extremists have ``been coming out of the shadows in the last
eight months or so,'' said Gary Sick, a former U.S. National
Security adviser who specializes in Iranian affairs.
   ``They're certainly being heard and are more prominent now,'' he
said in a telephone interview from his New York home. ``It's not
clear how dominant a position they now have in the decision-making
process, but they have a tremendous impact and that could have an
effect on the elections.''
   The candidates who will run for the 270-seat single-chamber
Majlis, or Parliament, will not be campaigning on party tickets in
the Western style because there are no formal political parties in
Iran.
   But they represent factions that reflect various shadings of
Islamic radicalism in a contest for control of Parliament, which
will play an important role in the post-Khomeini era.
   ``Any election in Iran is important,'' Sick said. ``The most
important thing is that the Iranians do have reasonably open
elections.''
   He added: ``There's always a certain amount of fixing, but
considering they're in the middle of a war and all the in-fighting
among the hierarchy, it's interesting that they're having an
election at all.''
   Membership of the Majlis, elected on a one-man, one-vote system,
has become increasingly controlled by the regime and only approved
candidates can run. About 20 million to 25 million people vote in
Iran.
   The elections, the third since Khomeini's 1979 Islamic
revolution toppled the monarchy, will be held against a backdrop of
the 7{-year-old war with Iraq, the growing international isolation
of Khomeini's fundamentalist regime and worsening economic woes.
   But the main issues, in public at least, will be land and
industrial reform, nationalization and social change.
   Among the candidates announced so far are Parliament Speaker
Hashemi Rafsanjani, hardline anti-American radical Hadi Ghafari,
Mohammed Yazdi, a former central committee member of the now
disbanded Islamic Republic Party.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, said that the candidates
also included, for the first time, 34 women, mainly from Tehran and
the northeastern city of Mashhad, one of the hotbeds of
revolutionary Islam.
   Rafsanjani, Prime Minister Hussein Musavi, President Ali
Khamenei, and Chief Justice Ayatollah Mussavi Ardebeli, as heads of
identifiable factions have been maneuvering for months to shape and
dominate the next Majlis.
   Khamenei, 48, is serving his second four-year term as president
and is constitutionally barred from running again in the next
presidential election in 1989.
   His political base was seriously weakened last June when
Khomeini disbanded the Islamic Republic Party, which the president
headed.
   Khomeini, 87 and reported in poor health, said he disbanded the
party, the vehicle used by Iran's clerics to seize political power
in the early days of the revolution, because it was riven by
factionalism.
   Rafansjani, who also has strong support in the Majlis, is
looking ahead to the presidential election and wants to replace
Khamenei with one of his allies.
   With the non-Islamic elements who helped put Khomeini in power
sytematically eliminated in bloody purges, the only opposition
party permitted is the Freedom Movement, a tiny anti-war faction
led by Mehdi Bazargan.
   The veteran liberal politician was Iran's first post-revolution
prime minister. But he quit in protest against the storming of the
U.S. embassy in November 1979 by Khomeini's loyalists.
   Despite constant harrassment, he and his followers remain a
faint voice of dissent.
   The Majlis has wide constitutional powers, unlike the
rubber-stamp body it became under the late Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi. But it has little decision-making power regarding the
conduct of the war.
   The Council of Guardians, a 13-member body dominated by
conservative clerics, has blocked parliamentary efforts to push
through sweeping economic reforms, underlining the conflict between
the radicals, led by Musavi and others, and the more traditionalist
factions.
   The traditionalist factions are linked to the ``Bazaaris,'' the
wealthy merchant class who have survived under the revolution and
who retain considerable economic and political influence.
   But Khomeini recently gave the Majlis, and the radicals, a major
boost with a series of edicts that widened state powers and control
of the war-battered economy.
   Legislation on land reform and nationalization blocked by the
Council will now be resubmitted to the Majlis and is likely to be
become law.
   ``This was a victory for the Majlis and the radicals over the
more conservative forces,'' Sick commented. ``Without saying so,
Khomeini's edicts changed the constitution. It wasn't coincidental
that Khomeini issued these edicts before the elections.''

   A rally to protest Reagan administration policy in Central
America drew 1,900 participants and 250 counterdemonstrators Sunday
in St. Paul, Minn., while 600 people rallied in Los Angeles. There
were no reports of violence or arrests.
   ``We must demand an end to intervention and we must demand our
government to stop lying to us,'' Anne Winkler of the Central
America Peace Action Committee told the St. Paul crowd.
   After listening to speeches and singing songs for about an hour
at the Capitol, the group marched to the nearby Cathedral of St.
Paul for a church service.
   The service commemorated the assassination of Salvadoran Roman
Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was shot in a church March
24, 1980, the day after he called on the Salvadoran government to
stop repressive actions.
   Capt. Richard Smith of Capitol Security said the anti-war
protesters at the Capitol numbered about 1,900. A group of about
250 counter-demonstrators was on hand and chanted
pro-administration slogans from the Capitol's side steps, but there
was no trouble, Smith said.
   In Los Angeles, a caravan of horn-tooting cars, decked out with
protest posters, snaked 10 miles through city streets from downtown
Los Angeles to the federal building in Westwood, where more
demonstrators greeted them with cheers.
   Some passing drivers honked and flashed the two-finger ``peace''
sign in shows of support, while other motorists shouted curses at
the protesters, estimated to number 600.
   Speakers at the rally, sponsored by a coalition of Los
Angeles-area peace groups, praised the cease-fire agreement signed
last week by Nicaraguan Contra rebel leaders and the leftist
Nicaraguan government.
   But Gary Prevost of the Nicaraguan Solidarity Committee told the
St. Paul rally that it was premature to celebrate the agreement
between Nicaragua's rulers and the Contras.
   ``The United States government has not given up its goal; it has
not decided the Nicaraguans are to live in peace,'' he said.

   A leaking tank of propane gas ordered out of a
Pennsylvania town was safely emptied here Sunday, but Delaware
officials complained they never gave permission for the tank to be
brought into their state.
   ``We're very upset because they didn't notify us they planned to
move it and (because of) the hour they chose to move it,'' John E.
Wilson III, secretary of the state Department of Natural Resources
and Environmental Control, said Sunday.
   Herm Bruce, spokesman for the State Emergency Response Team,
said Amtrak officials had the tank and its explosive contents moved
into Delaware in the middle of the night. An Amtrak spokesman said
the transfer was done after 5:30 a.m. Sunday.
   Delaware state officials learned of the shipment only because
fire dispatchers in Pennsylvania told their local counterparts
across the line in Delaware that the shipment was en route, Bruce
said.
   State police then halted four other tanks before they entered
the state, including two that also showed signs of minor leaks, he
said. Those four tanks were taken to Eddystone, Pa., where they
were to be drained overnight, police there said.
   Bruce stressed that the leaking tank problem was not a serious
threat.
   But residents in a sparsely populated area near the Amtrak
railroad yard here were advised to stay indoors for about five
hours Sunday as workers transferred the propane from the leaking
tank into an intact one, Bruce said. Nearby roads also were closed
as a precaution.
   On Friday, train traffic was disrupted around Ridley Park, Pa.,
when the leak in the tank was first discovered. Interstate 95,
which runs over railroad tracks at the spot the tank and four
others were being stored, also was closed for a time.
   The tanks, about 50 feet long and 6 feet in diameter, are used
by Amtrak to hold propane that fuels heaters during wintertime to
thaw out track switches, said Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black.
   It appeared the leak in the one tank was successfully capped
Friday evening, Black said, but another leak was discovered late
Saturday afternoon and once again rail traffic and Interstate
traffic were suspended.
   He confirmed that the tank had been transferred to Delaware on
Sunday but said he didn't know anything about the charges that
state officials had not been notified. He said the tank left Ridley
Park about 5:30 and arrived in Delaware about an hour later.
   Two of the four tanks that were returned to Ridley Park have
small leaks but are not an ``imminent danger,'' Black said Sunday.
   Ridley Park Fire Chief Raymond L. Lonabaugh said Saturday that
he ordered Amtrak to remove the leaking tank. The tank was
disconnected from the other tanks and loaded onto a railroad car,
Lonabaugh said.
   Lonabaugh said two Amtrak employees were injured Friday night
when they tried to cap the leaking tank without donning protective
clothing or respirators. But Black said he didn't know about any
workers being injured.

   State Sen. Greg Tarver was shot and
wounded Saturday night, but refused to press charges after
identifying the attacker as his wife, police said.
   The shooting happened at Tarver's home less than an hour after
he returned from a special session of the Legislature in Baton
Rouge. Police learned of the shooting when Tarver's mother phoned
to report it, said Police Chief Charles Gruber.
   Tarver, 41, a senator since 1984 and one of only a handful of
blacks in the 39-member body, was taken to LSU Medical Center,
Gruber said. Hospital spokeswoman Elaine King said he was in stable
condition, and a doctor said he was taken into surgery.
   Gruber said Tarver was shot once in the upper chest with a small
caliber weapon about 6:45 p.m.
   ``He has identified his assailant as his wife, Sabrina,'' said
Gruber, who disclosed no motive at a hospital news conference.
   ``There are no charges being filed at this time,'' Gruber said.
``She is not in custody at this time. We are not looking for her at
this time.
   ``Sen. Tarver requested that we not pursue anything at the
moment,'' he said, adding that police would pursue an investigation
in case Tarver changed his mind about pressing charges.
   Gruber would not say where Mrs. Tarver was, and there was no
answer at the Tarver home.
   Dr. Darryl Williams, dean of the LSU Medical School, said Tarver
was taken into surgery. And, though he wouldn't speculate on the
risk, Williams added: ``Any injury in that area can be
life-threatening.''
   Several of Tarver's legislative colleagues and one of Gov. Buddy
Roemer's aides went to the hospital soon after he was shot.

   Michael Dukakis has laid out plans to establish
himself as the Democratic presidential front-runner by building up
a lead of 250-350 delegates over his nearest challenger, targeting
delegate-rich New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
   In addition, the Dukakis organization hopes to reap delegates
from what it sees as two rival campaigns about to collapse, as well
as pick up support from ``super delegates'' and others now counted
as uncommitted.
   ``I think that there's a magic number in this process in terms
of what kind of distance is going to be adequate to separate a
front-runner from second- or third-place candidates in this
process,'' said Tad Devine, who handles delegate selection for the
Massachusetts governor.
   ``That magic number is probably somewhere between 253, the
unpledged number of delegates from Congress, and 362, the number of
votes on the Democratic National Committee.''
   The strategy won't guarantee the nomination for Dukakis, but a
strong delegate lead would encourage party leaders and uncommitted
delegates to rally round the leader to avoid the spectacle of a
deadlocked convention in July.
   Dukakis, with 597 delegates, currently is locked in a three-way
race for the delegate lead in the Democratic presidential race,
holding a narrow edge over Jesse Jackson, at 585, and a wider
margin over Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., at 363.
   Devine said he believed it was a ``real possibility'' that
Dukakis could pick up the 1,500-plus delegates he needs to clinch
the Democratic nomination as early as May.
   But an aide to Gore, echoing the statements of other campaigns,
said it was all but impossible for anyone to have the nomination
won before the season's June 7 finale, the California and New
Jersey primaries.
   ``I don't think it's in the cards for any candidate to have
anywhere near 2,082 delegates by June 7,'' said Rick Hutcheson, who
follows delegate selection for the Gore campaign.
   In private, Dukakis aides are willing to discuss specifics,
outlining how the campaign plans to do in each of the remaining
states. However, neither the Jackson or Gore campaign want to talk
about their prospects in such detail. Jackson's campaign declined a
request for an interview.
   ``We haven't designated any state as a make-or-break state for
us and we're not going to,'' Hutcheson said. ``Instead, we're
focused on a steady accumulation of delegates both by participating
in the processes and by wooing, as we have done successfully to
date, a good many of the super delegates.''
   The Dukakis campaign hopes to deliver a one-two punch by winning
the New York primary on April 19 and the Pennsylvania primary on
April 26. A total of 359 delegates are at stake in those two
Northeast states.
   ``There are real opportunities for one candidacy, one candidate
in this process, to move up from the pack,'' Devine said. ``The
break point in this process to put together a nomination is between
April 19 and April 26.''
   In addition, 253 members of the House and Senate are to be
chosen as super delegates in Democratic caucuses April 19-20 on
Capitol Hill. Other super delegates, who hold seats automatically
at the national convention because of their positions in the party
or government, include members of the Democratic National
Committee, Democratic governors and former party leaders.
   ``That week is almost a `mini Super Tuesday,''' Devine said.
``So I see that as a time when a candidate must put some distance
between himself and his competitors.''
   The only place where a competitor could make up a lot of ground
in one spot is New Jersey, with 109 delegates at stake, but Dukakis
is strong there, Devine said. California, with 314 delegates at
stake, is the largest single primary for the Democrats but the
rules are structured that big delegate gains there by any candidate
over another are unlikely, he said.
   A total of more than 300 national convention delegates now
committed to Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt and Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon would be up for grabs if those two candidates, whose
campaigns are fading, drop out of the race.
   ``I'm not predicting that either Simon or Gephardt is going to
get out of this race in the immediate future,'' Devine said. ``I'm
just saying that I think that the pressures to sustain a candidacy,
without putting on the board delegates, are going to be substantial
and maybe insurmountable.''

<HEAD>Aquino Swears In Commission For Moslem Autonomy; Rebel Violence
Kills 22</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARO CORTES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COTABATO CITY, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino swore
in a commission Saturday to prepare for Moslem autonomy in the
southern Philippines and criticized Moslem separatists and other
rebels fighting the government.
   ``Even now, the forces which nearly destroyed our country
continue to harass our efforts to rebuild the country and bring it
peace,'' Mrs. Aquino told the 44 members of the Regional
Consultative Committee.
   In fighting Friday, military officials in Manila said troops
killed 10 communist New People's Army guerrillas in Luzon island's
Albay province. They said one soldier was killed in the encounter.
Other rebel violence Thursday and Friday left at least a dozen
other people dead.
   Mrs. Aquino flew to Mindanao island to inaugurate the commission
after the largest Moslem rebel group failed to win full membership
in the Organization of Islamic Conference but obtained assurances
of continued support from the influential bloc.
   Communist insurgents, fighting the government for 19 years, are
reported to have struck alliances with some Moslem extremists on
Mindanao.
   Hundreds of soldiers armed with automatic rifles and grenade
launchers guarded the Saturday's inauguration ceremonies, held in a
government complex on the outskirts of Cotabato City, a mixed
Moslem-Christian city 560 miles southeast of Manila.
   At least six people were killed in clashes Friday between
members of the rival Moro National Liberation Front and the Moro
Islamic Front south of the city. The two groups, which split in the
mid-1970s, have been fighting for Moslem rule on Mindanao and other
southern islands for more than 15 years.
   On Thursday, about 200 Moslem rebels attacked two villages in
the Mindanao province of Zamboanga del Sur, killing six militiamen
and burning hundreds of houses, military officials said.
   Through decades of migration from Luzon and the Visayas islands,
Christians now outnumber Moslems in 17 of the 22 provinces on
Mindanao and the Sulu island chain. The region is the homeland of
the Philippines' estimated 5 million Moslems.
   The commission is to hold public hearings to determine the
extent of autonomy to be granted the region. It will also help lay
down the administrative framework that will govern the region.
   Of the commission's 44 members, 21 are Christians. The rest are
Moslems or members of tribes belonging to neither faith. Rebel
groups are not represented in the body.
   The Moslem separatist revolt broke out in the southern
Philippines a few weeks after then-President Ferdinand Marcos
imposed martial law in September 1972. The fighting peaked in 1974
and, according to official estimates, claimed more than 50,000
lives by 1976.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan delivered a nostalgic
valedictory to the Gridiron Club annual dinner Saturday night,
poked fun at Vice President George Bush's many ``home'' states and
jokingly applauded his wife's surprise on-stage performance with
the quip: ``Raisa, top that.''
   The president, traditionally the last speaker on the program at
the press organization's satirical banquet, also took shots at some
other presidential aspirants.
   It was the eighth year in a row that Reagan had attended the
show and dinner and it was the last he will attend as president. He
is the 17th consecutive president to attend the event and second
only to Franklin D. Roosevelt for the numer of dinners attended.
   But it was Nancy Reagan who stole the show with her unexpected
singing solo to the tune of ``Thanks for the Memories.'' One verse
referred to that ``Soviet Mona Lisa, otherwise known as Raisa, who
said, `Would you like to see my MasterCard and Visa?'''
   When her husband followed her to the podium, he said: ``Before I
refuse to take questions, I have an opening statement. I thought
Nancy's performance was absolutely wonderful. Raisa, top that
....'' Raisa Gorbachev is the wife of Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   Reagan later observed that if Republican presidential hopeful
Pat Robertson ``made it, there'd be no more `Hail to the Chief.' It
would be `When the Saints Go Marching In.'''
   Referring to Bush's place of birth (Massachusetts), his state of
family connections (Connecticut), his state of political activity
(Texas) and the state where he spends a lot of time (Maine), Reagan
said Bush could win the presidential race ``if he carried his own
states.''
   Looking out over the 700 guests _ the men wearing white tie and
tails and the women formal attire _ Reagan said he had not seen
such a dressy group ``since the Grosse Pointe Republican caucus,''
a reference to the affluent Detroit suburb.
   Before the Reagans took the stage at a downtown hotel, New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo delivered the traditional speech for the Democrats
and Sen. Al Simpson, R-Wyo., spoke for the Republicans.
   Cuomo's 15-minute recitation of one-line quips concluded with a
fond remembrance of President John F. Kennedy and a warm expression
of best wishes to President Reagan, wishing him ``health and
happiness and many years.''
   Earlier, Cuomo brought the audience to rapt silence when he
referred to the issue of whether Reagan should pardon Lt. Col.
Oliver North and former National Security Adviser John M.
Poindexter for their roles in the Iran-Contra affair.
   One option, Cuomo said, would be to ``swap Poindexter and North
for (Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio) Noriega and a
dictator to be named later.''
   Simpson asserted that ``People who take the high rode of
humility in this town are not bothered by heavy traffic.''
   He also said that ``It was so cold in Casper, Wyoming, the other
day, I saw a lawyer going down the street with his hand in his own
pocket.''
   During the show, a chorus of Washington journalists thanked
Reagan ``for the memories'' _ the memories ``of Stockman and Jim
Watt, the Iran-Contra plot, of Ollie and Bill Casey, the diversions
you forgot.''
   ``Oh, thank you, so much,'' sang Gridiron members in a musical
spoof that also took aim at Democratic and Republican presidential
candidates, administration officials and television evangelists.
   Organizers allowed no live broadcast of the event by radio or
television.
   The ``Thanks for the Memories'' tune lampooned former Budget
Director David Stockman, the late CIA director Casey, ex-Interior
Secretary James Watt and former White House aide Oliver North.
   The club also ``thanked'' Mrs. Reagan for ``banishing (former
Secretary of State) Al Haig and bloodying up (former staff chief)
Don Regan's nose.''
   The 103-year-old club also presented a spoof to the tune of ``To
All the Girls I've Loved Before'' by show members playing former
Sen. Gary Hart and television evangelist Jim Bakker.
   Responding to the tune were show members playing the parts of
``Donna Rice'' and ``Jessica Hahn,'' who sang: ``Our men are on the
ropes and they say we're the dopes.''
   A skit member playing Bush sang to the tune of Michael Jackson's
``Bad.'' Among the lyrics: ``They know by now that I'm no wimp...
I'm a pit bull from Kennebunkport (Maine) and I'm ready to bite
again.''
   A satirical version of ``America, the Beautiful'' made fun of
Democratic candidate Richard Gephardt's focus on trade as a
campaign issue: ``O beautiful for Subaru, And Datsun, now Nissan,''
the song went. ``America, America, God shed his grace on these: Thy
tiny cars and sushi bars, and all things Japanese.''

   Jesse Jackson won Michigan's primary-like
caucuses on Saturday, blowing past Michael Dukakis for an
industrial state victory that tightened the Democratic presidential
race. For Richard Gephardt, third place meant the end was near for
his White House hopes.
   Jackson defeated Dukakis by almost 2-1 by running strongly
across the state and winning huge majorities in Detroit. That broad
support meant the preacher-turned-politican scored a delegate
plurality as well.
   ``Today is a message of hope,'' Jackson said in Milwaukee.
``People are responding to authenticity and message and soul over
just money and mechanics....
   ``This is not my night alone,'' he said. ``When we, the working
people, stand together, we win and we make America stronger.''
   It was a disappointing night for Dukakis, who has been tried to
break away from Jackson to become the front-runner for the 1988
nomination.
   ``I don't think I did very well in Michigan,'' the Massachusetts
governor said as he congratulated Jackson.
   The news was not all bad for Dukakis as he picked up a win
Saturday in North Dakota and was gaining strength in the Iowa
county conventions.
   For Gephardt, the ``Michigan miracle'' did not happen. Aides had
said the Missouri congressman probably would withdraw from the
presidential race and file for re-election to his House seat with
such poor results.
   ``We're going to go home tomorrow and meet with our family and
we'll have some word for you the first of next week...,'' Gephardt
said in Milwaukee. ``We haven't decided anything. We're going to go
home and have a family meeting.''
   However, a Missouri state party leader _ State Rep. Anthony D.
Ribaudo _ said he spoke with Gephardt by telephone late Saturday
and that ``Dick Gephardt has informed me he'd like to proceed with
his career in Congress. The congressional seat becomes (his) No. 1
priority.''
   Ribaudo, the Missouri House majority leader, said he was told
Gephardt would fly Monday to Jefferson City, Mo., to file for
re-election even while keeping his presidential candidacy alive in
some form.
   With returns from 94 percent of the voting sites in Michigan,
Jackson had 107,689 or 55 percent to 55,337 or 28 percent for
Dukakis. Gephardt had 24,995, or 13 percent.
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois had 4,069 for 2 percent and Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee had 3,818 for 2 percent. Neither man
put significant resources into the state.
   Jackson won enormous majorities in Detroit. In the 1st
Congressional District, Jackson beat Dukakis 25,427 to 1,808 and in
the 13th, the margin was 17,715 to 1,536.
   The Michigan raw votes translated into national convention
delegates. Initial calculations gave Jackson 61, Dukakis 43,
Gephardt 22, and 12 undecided among the 138 pledged delegates.
   In North Dakota, the precinct caucus results made this the
preliminary split for national convention delegates: Dukakis, 5;
Jackson, 3; and Gephardt, 2. Five would go as uncommitted delegates.
   These results tightened the delegate race a bit. In the AP
delegate count, Dukakis has 596.55 to Jackson's 584.55. Gore had
362.8 delegates, Gephardt 178, Simon 171.5 and uncommitted 371.6.
   ``Now we can talk about twin bills, double headers, and that
sort of thing,'' said Joel Ferguson, Jackson's state coordinator.
``I think we're going to take the majority of congressional
districts, which we consider a major victory.''
   ``We've got lots and lots of contests up ahead,'' Dukakis said.
``This is a marathon and it's going to continue to be a marathon.
There's much to do and there are many miles to go.''
   Dukakis won in North Dakota's precinct caucuses, where the
process of picking 15 delegates to the national convention was just
beginning.
   He picked up strength in the Iowa county conventions, while
Gephardt slipped. Gephardt won the Feb. 8 precinct caucuses there,
but he was trailing Dukakis in returns from the county meetings,
the next step in the complicated delegate-selection process.
   Turnout in Michigan was much higher than in 1984, when about
123,400 Democrats voted. Democratic Party chief Rick Wiener said
the total would top 200,000.
   Gephardt's hopes for a win were hurt by the refusal of national
labor union leaders to fall in behind his candidacy. He
particularly felt the failure to win an endorsement from the United
Auto Workers, big supporters of Gephardt's trade policies and the
biggest union in the state.
   Dukakis built an impressive organization in this industrial
state, where he hoped a win would give him a lion's share of the
delegates as well as a popular vote victory. The organization, a
heavy dose of television advertising and backing from Detroit Mayor
Coleman Young helped give the Massachusetts governor the lead in
the polls.
   ``You just tell them to go with the guy with the eyebrows and
we'll have a very good Saturday,'' Dukakis told the Polish-American
Century Club in Hamtramck, Mich., referring to his distinctive,
heavy eyebrows.
   Jackson whipped up fervor across the state with large
enthusiastic rallies and a bit of television advertising.
   ``The talking is over. It's time to work,'' Jackson said in
Pontiac. ``Everybody who even looks 17 or older, they are eligible
to vote.''
   Michigan residents who are 17 but who will turn 18 by the
general election may vote in the caucus.
   The caucus was actually a limited primary. Voters merely had to
show up at the poling places, provide Michigan identification,
declare their Democratic allegiance and then vote.
   Michigan Republicans split up their 77 delegates at their state
convention two months ago, giving the lion's share to George Bush.

   Democrat Richard Gephardt, who had tried
to restart his presidential campaign in Michigan, said Saturday he
would meet with his family Sunday to decide whether he would pull
out of the race and run for re-election to Congress.
   Gephardt, running in third place in returns from Michigan's
caucuses behind Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis on Saturday, had
said he needed to do well in Michigan to sustain a candidacy that
took off in Iowa but stumbled in the South on Super Tuesday.
   ``We're going to go home tomorrow and meet with our family and
we'll have some word for you the first of next week...,'' Gephardt
said late Saturday. ``We haven't decided anything. We're going to
go home and have a family meeting.''
   However, Missouri state Rep. Anthony D. Ribaudo, the Missouri
House majority leader, said late Saturday that Gephardt will file
Monday for re-election to his congressional seat although he will
keep his presidential candidacy alive in some form.
   Ribaudo said he spoke to Gephardt who ``informed me he'd like to
proceed with his career in Congress. The congressional seat becomes
(his) No. 1 priority.''
   Tuesday is the deadline for Gephardt to file as a candidate for
re-election to Congress from Missouri. Although aides said he could
file for re-election and remain a candidate for president, his
showing in Michigan increased the chances he would drop out of the
presidential contest.
   Gephardt joined the other Democratic presidential candidates in
speaking to Wisconsin Democrats at the party's annual statewide
Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Milwaukee.
   He said there was ``no question'' that his long bid for the
presidency was worthwhile _ a quest that he said throughout the day
had taken him to 49 states in 24 months of campaigning.
   Campaign manager Bill Carrick said no decisions about the future
of his campaign would be made before Sunday. The mood among
Gephardt's forces was somber, and there appeared to be a feeling of
resignation to events that had not gone Gephardt's way.
   Asked whether he would decide Sunday, Gephardt said, ``I really
don't know....''
   Gephardt leaped to the top of the Democratic field when he won
Iowa's caucuses Feb. 8. He forged a plurality victory in that
lead-off event through widely acclaimed television ads and a strong
populist message that prompted critics to charge he had switched
positions on an array of issues in an effort to appeal to
disaffected voters. Gephardt based his campaign on his call for
tough trade policies with foreign countries.
   He finished second in New Hampshire and won South Dakota, but
won only his home state in the 20-state voting on March 8.
   Earlier Saturday, Gephardt crossed paths with three other
presidential candidates _ Dukakis and Sens. Albert Gore Jr. and
Paul Simon _ in Wausau, Wis., as they campaigned toward Wisconsin's
April 5 primary.
   The four _ attending an outdoor rally in less than 20 degree
weather _ ddressed several hundred union workers for Marathon
Electric who are engaged in a labor dispute and have taken wage
cutbacks.
   Gephardt said: ``We're here because we care about wages in this
country, not going down but going up.''
   Gore and Gephardt crossed paths earlier at a Democratic meeting
in Merrill, Wis., where Gephardt streuck an optimistic note: ``I'm
going to give my inaugural address Jan 20, 1989. I invite you to be
there.''

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with five grafs to UPDATE with Saturday night arrests,

<DATELINE>PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 50,000 young people
jammed the streets of this desert resort Saturday for traditional
spring break revelry, watched closely by a reinforced police
presence.
   At least 15 arrests occurred during the day, mostly for
trespassing in hotels or public drunkenness, on top of roughly four
times as many arrests Friday night.
   Another 15 arrests, mostly for public drunkenness, were reported
in the evening as the young visitors took to their cars and created
gridlock.
   ``The traffic right now is backed up past the (aerial) tramway,
which is several miles out of town,'' said Sgt. Ron Starrs, adding
that no major disturbances were reported.
   The 100-degree heat kept many partying high school and college
students indoors earlier. Those who chose to saunter under clear
skies wore ``bathing suits, shorts, tanks tops, as little as
possible,'' said police Officer Karen Holtz, who estimated the
number of visitors at 50,000 in a city with a population of 36,000.
   Larger problems took place Friday night when police made about
60 arrests, mostly for public drunkenness and disturbing the peace,
and wrote about 200 citations, Lt. Lee Weigel said.
   ``There were a couple of disturbances, but nothing out of
hand,'' Ms. Holtz said. ``When you have alcohol involved, mouths
start getting bigger and guys start thinking they're tougher than
they are.''
   Police have beefed up their forces with the help of the
California Highway Patrol and Riverside County sheriff's deputies
to prevent a recurrence of the rock- and bottle-throwing melees of
two years ago that ended with nearly 600 arrests.
   In addition, sheriff's jail and transportation officers have
been hired for the week, and 10 agents from the state Alcoholic
Beverage Control Board will be on the lookout for liquor sales to
minors, officials said.
   During the 1986 spring break, hundreds of vacationing youths
went on a Good Friday rampage, hurling bottles at police, tearing
clothes off young women and briefly taking over the main street of
town.
   To prevent a recurrence last year, Palm Springs distributed
45,000 pamphlets to local schools and colleges warning that
visitors were expected to obey the law. A strengthened police force
awaited vacationers, including 40 officers from the Riverside
County Sheriff's Department and the California Highway Patrol.
   The result was 708 arrests and 4,943 misdemeanor citations
issued for such infractions as stepping off the sidewalk into the
street and riding a bicycle without reflectors. But crowds were
generally well-behaved, officials said, despite one episode of
bottle-throwing that dented a police car.

   Israeli troops shot and killed three
Palestinian protesters Sunday in a pre-dawn raid on a village in
the occupied West Bank, hospital officials and an Arab news agency
said.
   Soldiers raided the village of Maythalun, about 8 miles north of
Nablus, at 2 a.m. Sunday, said the Arab-owned Palestine Press
Service. Protests broke out and soldiers opened fire, killing
three, it said.
   An army spokesman confirmed the clashes but not the deaths, the
reports of which he said were being investigated.
   Troops opened fire after Arabs attacked them with axes and
stones and tried to run them over with two cars as they were
leaving the village after making arrests, the army spokesman said.
   A nurse at Al Ittihad hospital in Nablus identified the dead as
Omar Mahmoud Rabaiyeh, 23, who died of a gunshot wound to the
heart, Sahim Mahmoud Noerat, 27, who died of a wound in the neck
and Ghassan Qassem Noerat, 16, who was shot in the chest.
   Two other protesters were admitted with gunshot wounds, said the
nurse, Jehad Alawni.
   In other developments, an Israeli bus carrying Arab workers to
their jobs in Israel was set on fire in the West Bank town of
Halhoul, Israel radio said. The arsonists evacuated the bus before
setting it ablaze, the radio said.
   The Palestine Press reported additional clashes in Bet Ummar,
near the West Bank city of Hebron and said the army closed Hebron
itself to some traffic. No further details were available.
   In Taibe, an Arab village in northern Israel, police arrested
six Arabs who allegedly threw five firebombs at a police station,
Israel radio said. It was not clear whether the motive was criminal
or political.
   Before Sunday's incident, the Palestinian death toll stood at
114 in unrest that began last December, according to U.N. figures.
One Israeli soldier has been killed.
   On Saturday, two Arabs were killed and at least nine wounded in
clashes in Kafr Thulth, 28 miles northwest of Jerusalem.

   Iran and Iraq lobbed long-range missiles
into each other's capitals Sunday and Iran said its forces punched
deeper into northeast Iraq, moving closer to a key hydroelectric
plant and oilfield.
   Shipping officials reported Iranian gunboats on Sunday attacked
the 24,529-ton Indian tanker Jainarayan Vyas in the southern
Persian Gulf, wounding one crewman and setting it on fire.
   The Iraqis fired a long-range Al Hussein missile into Tehran, a
city of 6 million, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   Another missile was launched on Tehran and two into the central
city of Isfahan, ancient capital of the Persian empire, said INA,
monitored in Nicosia.
   The Iranians said the missiles hit residential neighborhoods,
causing unspecified civilian casualties.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency in Tehran said
Revolutionary Guards fired two missiles at Baghdad, which has a
population of 5 million.
   The agency, also monitored in Nicosia, said the missiles were
aimed at ``two military targets'' in retaliation for Iraqi missiles
that hit Tehran Saturday, killing at least seven civilians and
hitting an orphanage.
   Baghdad Radio reported one Iranian missile hit a residential
district of the Iraqi capital Sunday, demolishing houses, shops and
cars. It said there were ``many civilians killed or wounded,
including women and children.''
   The radio made no mention of a second Iranian missile.
   Hundreds of civilians on both sides have been killed in missile,
air and artillery attacks since Feb. 29.
   Tehran Radio reported Iran also fired four missiles at
``industrial and military installations'' in the strategic southern
Iraqi port of Basra, and two other border towns further north
Sunday.
   In northeastern Iraq, IRNA said Revolutionary Guards killed or
wounded 700 Iraqi soldiers to seize the southern shore of Lake
Darbandikhan, high in the Kurdistan mountains.
   It said an Iraqi infantry brigade and an artillery battalion
were severely mauled in a three-pronged attack in the 12-day-old
offensive.
   The agency said the Iranians destroyed 20 tanks and armored
vehicles and captured 15 in annihilating the Iraqi armored column
when the Iraqis made an abortive counter-attack.
   The fighting flared as the Iranians broke out of their
bridgehead on the eastern shore of the 10-mile-long lake in the
strategic region east of Iraq's Kirkuk oilfields.
   Iraq had no immediate report on the reported fighting.
   Kirkuk accounts for 1.5 million barrels of oil a day, more than
half Iraq's oil production and vital for its war effort.
   IRNA said the Revolutionary Guards stormed the Shaakh Shamshir
heights overlooking a big hydroelectric dam on the lake's
southernmost point.
   The facility provides most of the power for the region as well
as the capital Baghdad, 120 miles to the southeast.
   By Iranian account, the Revolutionary Guards control more than
40 square miles of Iraqi territory east and south of the lake.
   Iraq said Saturday that the Iranians had pushed 10 miles into
Kurdistan.
   The Iranians claim they have killed or wounded 11,500 Iraqis,
captured 4,500 and destroyed 200 tanks and armored vehicles since
they launched the offensive March 16.

<TEXT>
   An Israeli court on Sunday sentenced Mordechai
Vanunu, the former nuclear technician who spilled his country's
atomic secrets to a British newspaper, to 18 years in prison for
treason and espionage.
   A three-judge panel announced its sentence in a closed-door
session at Jerusalem's district courthouse shortly after hearing
sentencing arguments from both sides.
   Vanunu's trial has been shrouded in secrecy since it began in
September. Officials said an open trial would harm state security.
   The crimes for which Vanunu was convicted carry a maximum death
penalty in Israel. However, prosecutors said earlier they would ask
for a life sentence, which in Israel is limited to 20 years. The
court lightened that sentence by two years but its reasons were not
made public.
   According to Israeli law, Vanunu could be released on good
behavior after 12 years. Legal commentators said early release was
unlikely, given the nature of Vanunu's crimes.
   Defense attorney Avigdor Feldman said he plans to appeal to
Israel's Supreme Court.
   Vanunu, 34, was convicted last week of treason and espionage for
telling The Sunday Times of London Israel had nuclear weapons.
   A Jewish-born convert to Christianity, Vanunu worked for 10
years at Israel's nuclear facility in the southern desert town of
Dimona. He then left Israel, smuggling out photographs he took from
inside the facility.
   In October 1986, Vanunu handed over the photographs and details
about Israel's nuclear program to The Sunday Times. Based on his
information, the newspaper reported Israel stockpiled the world's
sixth largest nuclear arsenal.
   Israel never responded directly to allegations of its nuclear
capacity, saying only it would not be the first country to
introduce such weapons into the Middle East.
   Several days after the newspaper published his revelations,
Vanunu disppeared from London.
   How he returned to Israel was never revealed but his family said
he was lured to Rome by an American woman named Cindy, then
kidnapped by Israeli agents and spirited home to stand trial.
   During a pre-trial appearance last year, Vanunu managed to flash
waiting reporters a message scribbled on his hand. In the message,
he said he had been kidnapped in Rome.
   After the incident, security precautions around Vanunu
increased. He was transported to the courthouse in a white van with
painted-over windows, and police sirens blared as he was hustled
indoors to prevent contact with reporters.
   Vanunu's brother, Asher, said following the sentence that his
brother had been done an injustice.
   ``The trial was not conducted as it should have been,'' Asher
was quoted as saying by Israel army radio. He said an international
campaign for Vanunu's release would put pressure on the Israeli
government to release Vanunu.
   During sentencing arguments Sunday, judges refused to allow an
American expert on international law testify for the defense.
   The expert, Richard Falk of Princeton University in Princeton,
N.J., said he was shocked the court refused to let him testify and
criticized Vanunu's convictions on treason and espionage charges.
   ``Individual conscience is more important in the nuclear age
than the security of the state,'' Falk told reporters. ``The state
can be wrong.''
   Vanunu has testified he made his revelations to alert the Middle
East and the world to the dangers of nuclear weapons, not for
personal gain or out of a desire to harm his country.

   Regulars at JD's Circle In weren't about to
stand by idly when armed robbers burst into the bar and demanded
money from owner Donna Hannum.
   Three or four robbers, one armed with a sawed-off shotgun,
entered the bar Saturday and ordered about 20 customers to stand
back, Mrs. Hannum said.
   But some customers got riled when one of the robbers seized the
46-year-old woman, shoved her toward the cash register and grabbed
some cash.
   ``The guys got mad and they started throwing tables and chairs
at the robbers, beer bottle and ashtrays and anything else they
could get their hands on,'' Mrs. Hannum said.
   A couple of customers wrestled with one of the men.
   The robbers fired one shotgun blast and a pistol shot into the
ceiling to quiet the crowd, she said, before fleeing with an
undetermined amount of cash.
   No injuries were reported among customers, Police Sgt. Don
Osterhaus said.
   ``She's a nice lady and the customers didn't want them messing
with her,'' he said.
   Mrs. Hannum said she wasn't shaken by the robbery, the first in
the three years she and her husband, Jerry, have owned the bar.
   ``I've got good customers,'' Mrs. Hannum said. ``I'm glad they
stood behind me.''

   A troop of monkeys roaming the
southern desert attacked a motorist who ran over one of its
members, jumping on his car and smashing the windows, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
   The Okaz newspaper said a man was driving to work when he killed
the monkey on a highway in the Khamis Mesheit region. The
newspaper, which did not identify the man, quoted him as saying the
other monkeys chased his car but couldn't catch it.
   But when the man drove home later on the same road, he found the
monkeys still gathered around the dead animal's body, according to
the report. When they spotted his car, they jumped on it and
smashed the windows with their fists, the paper said.
   The driver sped off and saw the troop dragging the dead monkey
into the nearby mountains, Okaz said.
   Residents of the area say monkeys roam about the desert expanses
and sometimes spill over onto the highways.

   A retired air force general was shot dead
and a bomb exploded in central Madrid on Sunday, injuring two
people. Police blamed both attacks on the Basque separatist group
ETA.
   Police said the bomb was left on a motorcycle parked on General
Peron street in front of an office building when it exploded at
2:45 p.m.
   Two women walking by were injured by glass flying from broken
windows, but police said the injuries were not serious.
   In Salvatierra, retired Brig. Gen. Luis Azcarraga
Perez-Caballero, 81, was shot three times in the head by two men
who approached him as he left a church, police said.
   Salvatierra is a town near the Basque city of Vitoria, about 100
miles north of Madrid.
   No one claimed responsibility for either attack, but officials
said they believed ETA, which seeks independence for the
three-province Basque region of Spain, was responsible for both
incidents.
   Since taking up arms in 1968, ETA has claimed responsibility for
killing more than 600 people, mainly police, military and civil
guards officers.

   Pope John Paul II announced Sunday that he
will travel to Spain in 1989 to celebrate the next International
Youth Day.
   The pope visited Spain in 1982 and 1985. He announced his August
1989 trip to a group of youths after delivering Palm Sunday remarks
to about 100,000 people in St. Peter's Square.
   John Paul noted that it was the third International Youth Day
and called on youth people to discover a more ``profound vocation''
in the church.
   About 20,000 youths carrying palm or olive branches marched into
St. Peter's Square just as the pope, also carrying a palm branch,
led a procession out of St. Peter's Basilica.
   ``The uncertainties of youth are normal. But they can be
defeated. ... What is important is to believe that he (God) wants
to make each and every one of us free and responsible participants
in his plan to save the world,'' the pope told them after the Mass.

<TEXT>
   A three-page manuscript by Ludwig van Beethoven
containing a large part of the ``Ode to Joy'' from his Ninth
Symphony will be sold to the highest bidder, a researcher at
Sotheby's auction house said Sunday.
   Beethoven's untidy brown ink and pencil writing appears to be a
draft of alterations to the first, second and last movements and
were made after the first performance, said Stephen Roe, the
manuscript expert at Sotheby's.
   ``Nothing was publicly known of its existence until now and it
is an astonishing find,'' Stephen Roe, the manuscript expert at
Sotheby's, said Sunday.
   Roe said the manuscript is privately owned by a collector in
another country. He asked not to be identified.
   ``It's very much a collector's piece as the `Ode to Joy' is the
composer's most famous passage,'' said Roe, who researched the
document at Beethoven's birthplace in Bonn, West Germany, now a
museum.
   ``They didn't know about it there,'' he said.
   Roe said he thought the manuscript would be bought by a
collector at the London auction May 6 and could fetch up to
$180,000.
   Autograph manuscripts relating to Beethoven's symphonies are
very rare. Complete manuscripts of his 1st, 2nd and 3rd symphonies
are lost. His autograph manuscript of the Ninth Symphony, which he
completed in 1824, is in the German State Library in East Berlin.
   The changes were incorporated in the first printing of 1826 by
Schott and Sons, the German music publishers.
   There is another Beethoven brown-ink manuscript in the May 6
sale, a sketch-leaf of his early ideas for the slow movement of the
``Hammerklavier'' piano sonata, the longest he wrote.
   The item is estimated at $36,000 to $55,000, Roe said.
   ``It could be one of those which Beethoven amplified and
extended from one of the notebooks he carried around on his walks
in the countryside around Vienna, jotting down ideas in pencil,''
Roe said.

   Tamil youths looted and torched at
least 25 Moslem-owned shops and businesses in the eastern town of
Kalmunai, police and residents reported Sunday.
   A police officer at the Kalmunai police station, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said members of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, the largest Tamil militia, were responsible for the
attack Saturday about 125 miles northeast of Colombo.
   But a Roman Catholic priest in nearby Batticaloa said the
looting was done by unemployed Tamil youth who were released late
last year from jails after being detained as political suspects.
   ``There are scores of these Tamil youths in the east. They are
jobless and penniless,'' said the priest, who also spoke on
condition he not be identified. ``They grab every opportunity to
make a fast buck. This is a growing problem in the entire area.''
   The police official, however, claimed the attack on Moslem
establishments was a part of ``a grand design of Tiger rebels to
drive Sinhalese and Moslem civilians out of the Eastern Province.''
   He said that more than 1,500 Moslems fled Kalmunai after the
attack and sought refuge in mosques and schools in nearby areas.
   Tamil militants have been blamed for killing more than 125
people, most of them Sinhalese civilians, in the Eastern Province
since March 2 when the latest round of violence erupted.
   Officials say Tamil militants are engaged in driving away
Sinhalese and Moslem residents of the Eastern Province to ensure
complete dominance in the region.
   Most of the Tamils are Hindus. Sinhalese are mostly Buddhists
although some of them are Moslem.
   Tamil rebels claim the government is deliberately resettling
members of the majority Sinhalese community in the east to upset
traditional Tamil control of the area.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who control
the government and the military. Tamil rebels are fighting for a
separate homeland in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, where most
of them live.
   India and Sri Lanka signed a peace accord last July to end the
Tamil ethnic crisis but Tamil Tigers have not honored the pact.
More than 50,000 Indian peacekeeping troops are in Sri Lanka to
disarm the rebels and enforce the peace accord that grants some
autonomy to the Tamils.

<HEAD>Arafat's Men Take Over Camp's Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yasser Arafat's Fatah guerrillas have
taken control of Lebanon's largest Palestinian refugee camp after a
two-day wave of violence left five people dead, police said Sunday.
   The latest victims were a Fatah guerrilla and a Palestinian
woman killed Saturday in a shootout at the Ein el-Hilweh camp on
the outskirts of this southern port city, police reported.
   They said guerrillas of Abu Nidal's radical Fatah-Revolutionary
Council opened fire on the Fatah fighter, identified as Haitham
Diab, when he failed to stop at an one of their checkpoints in the
sprawling shantytown.
   Diab's killing touched off a brief firefight between Arafat's
supporters and Abu Nidal's guerrillas in which the woman passer-by,
Badea Oweida, was killed, police said.
   There have been frequent clashes between supporters of Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization, including Fatah, and rival
Syrian-backed factions as well as Abu Nidal's group.
   Police said the latest wave of violence that flared Friday
prompted the PLO's pro-Arafat military police, known as the ``armed
struggle corps,'' to take charge of Ein el-Hilweh's security.
   On Friday, gunmen ambushed the motorcade of Farid Hourani,
Fatah's military commander in the camp, killing him and two of his
bodyguards. Nine other Hourani aides were wounded.
   Police said there was no link between Friday's ambush and
Saturday's shootout.
   ``But the two incidents have led to an agreement to turn over
the camp's security to the `armed struggle corps,''' a police
spokesman said.
   Units of the force patrolled the camp's narrow alleyways on foot
and in jeeps Sunday without challenge from Arafat's rivals, police
said.
   The agreement was reached during a meeting late Saturday between
Arafat's representatives, Abu Nidal's aides and the ``popular
committee'' which runs the day-to-day affairs of the camp's 60,000
refugees.

<HEAD>Taxpayers Filing Later, Despite Bigger Refunds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Less than a month before the filing deadline,
fewer than half of Americans have finished their tax returns. But
refunds are bigger, the IRS is doing a better job answering
questions, and taxpayers are making fewer mistakes than had been
expected.
   ``I'm happy to report that so far, the filing season is going
much as we had predicted and hoped,'' IRS Commissioner Lawrence B.
Gibbs tells audiences.
   The Internal Revenue Service is almost 3 percent behind last
year's pace in processing returns, but blames that chiefly on
taxpayers' slowness in filing this year. Officials say there is
nothing to signal a repeat of 1985 when faulty computer programs
set off a chain of events that resulted in the worst filing season
in modern times.
   Through March 18, 47.6 million returns had been logged at the 10
IRS service centers. Just under 35 million had been processed.
   More than seven of every 10 returns are qualifying for refunds:
25 million refunds totaling $20 billion, an average of $809 apiece.
The number of refunds is down slightly and the average is up a bit
from 1987.
   So far this year, about 44 percent of the 107 million expected
individual returns have been filed. At the same stage last year,
the IRS had received almost 46 percent of the 104 million that
eventually were filed.
   The IRS has come under heavy criticism for having given the
correct answer to only 74.8 percent of taxpayers' calls for
assistance earlier this year. But in recent weeks, Gibbs says, the
accuracy rate has crept up to nearly 78 percent as telephone
``assistors'' become more familiar with the new law.
   Perhaps the most surprising statistic is that taxpayers are
making only 2 percent more mistakes than they were at this time
last year. According to the most recent estimate, that's nearly 5.5
million errors _ a number that had been expected to be far higher
since this is the first year that returns reflect the massive 1986
tax revision.
   The low error rate comes despite reports that many taxpayers are
finding some of the changes much more confusing than Congress
anticipated.
   One possible explanation is that most of the confusion comes
from tax changes that affect more-affluent taxpayers, such as
complicated new forms for calculating passive losses and taxes on
children's income.
   These taxpayers are less likely to qualify for refunds and,
thus, are in no hurry to file. Their mistakes likely would come
later in the filing season.
   The new law cut tax rates, increased the personal exemption to
$1,900, boosted the standard deductions for non-itemizers, and
reduced or eliminated several deductions.
   But most of the mistakes are not resulting from those changes.
Taxpayers instead are having problems with their arithmetic,
misreading the tax tables and misunderstanding a new provision that
prevents one person from being claimed as a dependent on two tax
returns.
   One of the most common mistakes on the single-page Form 1040EZ,
which may be used only by single taxpayers whose taxable income is
under $50,000, is on the bottom line. Many users of this form _ as
well as some who file the longer Form 1040A _ are unable to
subtract actual tax liability from the amount withheld and get the
correct answer.
   A common error among itemizers is incorrect addition or
subtraction on Schedule A, where deductions are listed. On 1040A
and 1040, some are unable to multiply the number of personal
exemptions by $1,900 and get the correct answer.
   Some mistakes are clearly a result of carelessness. Many filers
of 1040A are neglecting to write how much tax was withheld. Other
taxpayers use the wrong income figure for determining how much tax
they owe.
   But the most common mistake is a misunderstanding of the
standard deduction and personal exemption allowed a taxpayer who
can be claimed as a dependent by someone else. This affects a
student with some income whose main support is provided by a
parent, or a parent supported by a son or daughter.
   A single person who cannot be claimed by another gets the full
$2,540 standard deduction and the full $1,900 personal exemption.
But a student, for example, who can be claimed by a parent gets no
exemption and may be entitled to a standard deduction of as little
as $500, depending on income.
   Some taxpayers are neglecting to answer whether they may be
claimed by another. Others are taking the wrong standard deduction.
   If the IRS can correct your errors _ such as arithmetic or
failing to take the correct standard deduction _ it will.
   But the IRS will put your return aside and write you for more
information if, for example, your Schedule A deductions don't add
up; you neglect to say whether you may be claimed as a dependent by
another; you don't sign your return or your neglect to attach your
W-2.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recent elections have
further polarized politics in El Salvador and handed a major defeat
to the political center, cultivated by the United States as an
antidote to extremism.
   The rightist victory in legislative and municipal elections
March 20 sets the stage for the escalation of leftist guerrilla
conflict in this country already ravaged by eight years of civil
war.
   The nature of pre-election violence, which included car bombs
and club-wielding masked youths rampaging through the capital,
augured badly for those who had hoped that six years of civilian
rule by the Christian Democrats would promote moderation in the
search for solutions to El Salvador's problems.
   No country in the hemisphere gets more U.S. assistance than El
Salvador, which President Reagan has held up as an example of
success in Washington's avowed policy of fostering democracy in
Latin America.
   This Massachusetts-sized country of 5 million people received
about $550 million in U.S. military and economic aid last year.
U.S. assistance has totaled $3.5 billion since 1981.
   A rightist party, linked in the early 1980s to death squads
responsible for thousands of political murders, won a landslide
victory in the municipal and legislative elections.
   ``Liberty is written with blood. ... El Salvador is the tomb
where the Reds will meet their end,'' goes the party anthem of the
Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena.
   The party captured a majority in the 60-seat National Assembly
and most of the country's municipalities.
   Sigifredo Ochoa Perez, a retired army colonel and one of the
party's ideologues, Wednesday called for a crackdown on leftists
active outside guerrilla ranks.
   In the 10 days before the vote, left-wing university groups and
labor organizations staged several anti-government marches in the
capital. The marchers, their faces covered with bandannas and
carrying two-by-fours studded with nails, commandeered buses to
block side streets, burned telephone exchange boxes and set fire to
several vehicles.
   Police exercised restraint, resorting only once to tear gas to
disperse the demonstrators.
   ``We cannot allow this to continue, the destruction of state
property, private property,'' Ochoa said on a morning TV news
program. ``We have to impose law and order.''
   For their part, Marxist guerrillas waging the stalemated war
against the centrist Christian Democratic government plan to
broaden their campaign, according to rebel documents captured by
government forces.
   The documents outline a plan the guerrillas call ``Fire.'' It
calls for formation and indoctrination of ``mass organizations'' _
mostly among students and labor union people _ ``to deepen the
crisis.''
   Its authors, reportedly members of the guerrilla General
Command, said the government's options _ to increase repression or
continue allowing the demonstrators to act with relative impunity _
both favored the revolution.
   ``If they crack down on a big scale the insurrection will
increase in response to the repression, and if they do not,
insurrection will advance as a result of the crisis and hunger,''
it says.
   It says if ``Fire'' succeeds in forging a mass front, 1988
provides circumstances propitious for ``the seizure of power.''
   Guerrilla commander Joaquin Villalobos predicted last Tuesday
that as a result of the election, ``the country will become
ungovernable.''
   Speaking on Radio Vencermos, the rebels' clandestine station, he
said the rightist victory favored the rebels by giving the people
``a clear choice.''
   Alfredo Cristiani, president of Arena, told The Associated Press
his party would try to hammer out with other parties in the
assembly a peace proposal to submit to the guerrillas.
   ``If the guerrillas do not accept the proposal, which will be
the result of a national consensus, they do not leave any other way
out but a military solution,'' he said. He indicated that would
mean stepped-up combat.
   Ruben Zamora, vice-president of the Democratic Revolutionary
Front, told the AP Wednesday he did not believe the vote indicated
the electorate's shift to the right. The Revolutionary Front is
allied with the guerrillas and declined to take part in the
elections.
   ``What happened was that the electorate punished the Christian
Democrats for all the promises they did not fulfill,'' he said.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte was elected in 1984 on a platform
of ending the war and improving the average family's lot. The war
continues, unemployment is about 40 percent and inflation is
running at about 40 percent annually.
   The victory improves Arena's prospects in presidential elections
set for next March.
   Adolfo Rey Prendes, the front-runner for the Christian
Democratic presidential nomination, told reporters: ``If Arena
takes power, other parties' possibilities will be diminished. The
democratic process will be restricted.''

   In Roman Catholic areas of west
Belfast, British soldiers with rifles cocked patrol grimy streets
whose graffiti-filled walls boast of Irish Republican Army killings.
   A five-minute drive away, the center of the city bustles with
shoppers. After nightfall dozens of bars, restaurants and
nightclubs come alive with Northern Irelanders determined, despite
19 years of conflict, to enjoy themselves.
   Like Beirut, Belfast is a city compartmentalized by sectarian
strife and shadowy armed factions calling themselves
``paramilitaries.'' The front lines are the street junctions where
working-class Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods adjoin.
   Murderous rampages this month at two IRA funerals, in which five
people died, inflamed the nerves of a city that has lived with
violence for nearly 20 years of the so-called ``troubles.''
   On both sides of the sectarian divide, there is frustration,
anger, and a longing for peace. For some years, with the violence
in a sharp decline and signs emerging of economic rejuvenation,
optimists dared to hope Belfast was getting a fresh chance. But
with the latest violence, and no sign of a political solution, many
people now talk of leaving.
   The outlawed IRA and its legal political wing, Sinn Fein, remain
committed to ending British rule and uniting the
Protestant-majority province with the overwhelmingly Catholic
Republic of Ireland .
   The Protestants, under the banner ``No Surrender,'' are equally
determined to keep Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom.
   A cartoon in Dublin's Irish Times noted that while cease-fires
were being discussed in Nicaragua and Afghanistan, ``In Northern
Ireland, after almost 20 years of fighting, we are discussing the
policing of future funerals.''
   The sense of conflict never-ending is shared by young people who
have known nothing else.
   ``I'm really fed up with the trouble _ on both sides,'' said
Gail McCann, 23, a student at Queen's University in Belfast.
   ``When I get my degree, I think I'll go away and work if things
keep going like this. There's no future here.''
   Ms. McCann was part of a huge and mainly Protestant crowd which
thronged the grounds of City Hall on Thursday for a memorial
service for two British corporals who were beaten up and stripped
almost naked by mourners at an IRA funeral on March 19 and then
shot dead by IRA gunmen.
   The murders climaxed two weeks of rising tension after British
commandos shot dead three IRA guerrillas who were unarmed but
allegedly plotting a bombing in Gibraltar.
   On March 16, a Protestant gunman attacked mourners at the
guerrillas' funeral in the Catholic Milltown cemetery, killing
three people and wounding 68. The soldiers were murdered at the
funeral for one of the Milltown victims, an IRA man.
   ``I don't want to be called Irish anymore,'' a government
architect who identified himself only as Ivan said at the memorial
service where some people brought British flags and wreaths bearing
the initials of Queen Elizabeth II.
   ``It's savage _ bestial. I can't see any future,'' Ivan said.
``I think until children are educated together, it won't change.''
Most Northern Ireland schools are segregated according to religion.
   ``Bring back capital punishment for both sides,'' shouted a
middle-aged man. ``But start with Sinn Fein,'' chimed in a young
man.
   Three miles away in the heart of Catholic west Belfast, an
elderly man stood at the door of the Andersonstown Social Club, an
Irish nationalist haunt overlooking the garbage-strewn parking lot
where the soldiers' bodies were dumped.
   ``It's just another day to us. There's still plenty of
tension,'' he said.
   On Andersonstown Road, where the soldiers were seized, two
unemployed Catholics objected to the fuss about the murders.
   To them the real outrages were in Gibraltar when commandos
reputedly from the elite Special Air Service unit opened fire on
unarmed IRA members, and in Milltown when the Protestant let loose
with pistol and grenades.
   ``The SAS men who killed the three will get a medal, so why
don't they give a medal to the men who killed them two soldiers?''
asked one, who gave only his first name, Liam.
   ``It's been the same for the last 20 years _ depression and
frustration,'' said Francis McCann, 29. ``There's nothing they
(Catholics) can do about it, but they won't take abuse anymore.''
   On the Catholic Falls Road, the latest graffiti makes SAS stand
for ``Stripped and Shot.'' On the adjoining Protestant Shankill
Road, a fresh slogan says, ``Three Dead With One Stone.'' The
Milltown gunman's name is Michael Stone.
   In prosperous north Belfast, where middle-class Protestants and
Catholics live peacefully side by side, 26-year-old Karen McComish
said, ``You can forget about it here to a certain extent.''
   ``But after the events of last week, it's hard to deal with, but
it's either that or get out,'' she added.
   Big-name London stores have moved in to central Belfast, nearly
200 new restaurants and several dozen nightclubs have opened in the
last three years and tourism is up 14 percent.
   But the fear endures. ``It's so bad, I want to go away,'' says
Mary Eakin, a public relations executive. ``But my husband says,
`Mary, I love Ireland.'''

   Police charged a third man
Sunday in connection with the slayings of two British army officers
who were beaten by mourners at an Irish Republican Army funeral and
shot.
   Shop manager Thomas Hawkins, 35, of Belfast, appeared in Belfast
Magistrates Court where he was charged with withholding information
about the murders and allowing his premises to be used by
terrorists.
   He did not enter a plea and was ordered held in custody until
his next court appearance in 14 days.
   Cpls. David Howes, 23, and Derek Wood, 24, were killed March 19
after they drove up to the funeral procession of IRA member Kevin
Brady. Mourners dragged them from their car and beat them
unconscious. They were later shot behind a wall in a soccer stadium.
   Two other men, Alexander Murphy, 30, and Henry Maguire, 28, were
charged Friday with the soldiers' slayings and ordered Saturday to
remain in custody until their next court appearance on April 22.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force,
said it was still holding two other men for questioning.
   Details of the charges against Hawkins were not revealed.
   The detective in charge of the investigation told the court
Saturday that police have evidence, including bloodstains, clothing
fibres and footprints, linking Murphy and Maguire with the March 19
killings.

   Comedian Bob Hope joined a host of
celebrities to raise funds to combat AIDS in his first public
appearance since having prostate surgery a week ago.
   ``I think that we can use all our talent, all our money in the
world to help win this war,'' said Hope, who performed a
five-minute comedy routine at the event, ``Hollywood's Salute to
Broadway,'' Saturday.
   Hope joined actress Susan Anton, comic Jay Leno, Broadway
choreographer Tommy Tune and others to raise funds for 14 programs
and organizations dealing with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who received an award in
recognition of his efforts to promote awareness of the disease,

tragedy of the epidemic.
   ``Of all the things in this whole miserable mess, this is the
thing that is most depressing to me ... profoundly depressing to

   Reviewers concurred. Despite the years,
Rudolf Nureyev's still the greatest.
   Nureyev, who turned 50 on March 17, performed for the last time
the role of Siegfried in Tchaikovsky's ``Swan Lake'' at the Vienna
State Opera on Friday and Saturday.
   It was a sentimental end to the Vienna Dance '88 Festival.
Nureyev first performed the role, which he choreographed, on Oct.
15, 1964, at the State Opera.
   The Russian-born star and his illustrious partner, Dame Margot
Fonteyn, got a record 89 curtain calls for that premiere.
   The official newspaper Wiener Zeitung called this weekend's
performances a ``Farewell to a Legend.''
   ``There is no reason to mourn the golden era of the ballet star.
For what Nurev has (of course) forfeited in terms of power,
elegance and precision, he compensates for with stage presence,
personality and radiance,'' the government daily said.

   Donald J. Trump told a newspaper he plans to
make New York's famed Plaza Hotel ``the most luxurious hotel in the
world,'' but, uncharacteristically, the eponymous developer will
keep his name off the landmark building.
   ``It's got the most important name in the world and it's going
to remain that way,'' The New York Times quoted Trump as saying in
its Sunday editions.
   Trump outbid two other Manhattan developers and bought the posh
hotel for $390 million from Texas multimillionaire Robert M. Bass
and Aoki Corp. of Japan, the Times reported.
   Trump, whose other properties include the glitzy Trump Tower in
Manhattan and Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, N.J., said he signed a
contract for the hotel Friday and would take possession in 120 days.
   The hotel's new president will be Trump's wife, Ivana, who will
be paid ``$1 a year plus all the dresses she can buy,'' Trump said.

marriage to a University of Colorado student.
   ``I did not want to this news to detract from my focus on the
world championships (last week),'' Thomas said. ``Now that the
world championships are over, I want to let all my friends and
supporters know how happy I am.''
   Thomas' husband is Brian Vanden Hogen, 23.
   The two met at the University of Colorado when Thomas moved
there last year to train with her coach, Alex McGowan, and they
were married in Boulder.
   ``My husband will travel with me to some of the upcoming skating
exhibitions. I am thrilled.''
   There will be a tour of Europe following the world championships
and then there will be another tour in the United States until June.
   Thomas, of San Jose, Calif., celebrated her 21st birthday Friday
but came in third in the final standings of the women's event
Saturday. Katarina Witt of East Germany, the Olympic gold medalist,

   Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz,
creators and executive producers of ABC's ``thirtysomething,'' said
they wanted to deal with mundane concerns like in-law troubles and
choosing baby sitters that most other television shows ignore.
   ``It was our aim to explore these more delicate concerns of
life. I wanted to deal with smaller issues that don't get
explored,'' said Zwick, who joined Herskovitz and several of the
show's writers and cast members to discuss the program before about
600 fans Thursday at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
   The show, which explores the lives of seven aging baby boomers,
has been praised by some critics for its realism but criticized by
others for its ``yuppie whining.''
   ``To some degree, whining and moaning is a celebration of
life,'' Zwick said.
   Herskovitz admitted the program's situations don't appeal to
everyone.
   ``If it doesn't go along with someone's existence, it will turn
them off,'' he said.

   Actress Audrey Hepburn said Sunday she thinks of
her famine-relief work as a ``mission _ and one I do out of great
love.''
   The actress, who returned recently from a tour of Ethiopia as a
special ambassador for UNICEF, said the scenes of famine she
encountered there were ``heart-breaking.''
   ``It will get better if we all help,'' she told reporters at
London's Heathrow Airport upon her arrival from Toronto, Canada.
   What the people need more than anything is rain, she said. ``But
in the meantime, what they need is continued relief, food and the
means to preserve and contain their water.
   ``They don't have enough reservoirs or wells. The day they have
that will be the day that drought won't mean famine anymore.''

   Iranian gunboats rocketed an Indian
tanker in the Persian Gulf Sunday, setting its engine room ablaze
and wounding a crewmen, gulf-based shipping executives reported.
   Iran and Iraq fired missiles into each other's capitals in a
brutal long-range duel. In northeast Iraq, Iran said its troops
punched deeper into enemy territory, occupying strategic heights
that overlook a key hydroelectric dam.
   Both countries reported extensive civilian casualties in the
missile war.
   Shipping officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
24,529-ton Jainarayan Vyas, owned by the Shipping Corp. of India,
was en route to the Saudi Arabian port of Jubail to load
petrochemicals when it was hit.
   They said salvage tugs and the crew struggled for three hours to
extinguish a fire in the engine room.
   The tanker was attacked just before noon about 40 miles from the
Iranian-held Abu Musa Island. The island serves as a base for
Revolutionary Guards who attack neutral ships in armed speedboats
in retaliation for Iraqi air raids on Iranian tankers.
   The Jainarayan Vyas was hit in apparent retaliation for Iraqi
air raids on Iranian tankers overnight Friday.
   A Danish supertanker, the 337,700-ton Karama Maersk, was
initially believed to have also been attacked near Abu Musa.
   But shipping sources said the vessel had only relayed a distress
call from the stricken Indian vessel.
   Iran and Iraq, at war since September 1980, have attacked about
500 ships of various nationalities in the gulf in the ``tanker
war.'' About 300 seamen have been killed.
   Iraq fired a long-range Al Hussein missile Sunday into Tehran, a
city of 6 million, at 7.30 a.m. after vowing to ``level Iran's
cities,'' the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   Minutes later, another missile was launched on Tehran and two
into the central city of Isfahan, ancient capital of the Persian
empire, INA said.
   The Iranians said the missiles hit residential neighborhoods,
causing unspecified civilian casualties.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia,
said Revolutionary Guards fired two missiles at Baghdad.
   The agency said the missiles were aimed at ``two military
targets'' in retaliation for Iraqi missiles that hit Tehran
Saturday. Iran said the missiles killed at least seven civilians
and hit an orphanage.
   Baghdad Radio reported only one Iranian missile hit Baghdad,
home to 5 million. The missile exploded in a residential district
and demolishing houses, shops and cars. It said there were ``many
civilians killed or wounded, including women and children.''
   Iraq has fired 120 long-range missiles into Tehran, Isfahan and
the holy city of Qom, seat of Iran's religious hierarchy, since
Feb. 29.
   The Iranians have reported firing 45 long-range missiles into
Baghdad and dozens of short-range projectiles into other Iraqi
cities in that period.
   Tehran Radio reported that the Iranians also fired four missiles
at ``industrial and military installations'' in the strategic
southern Iraqi port of Basra, and two other border towns further
north Sunday.
   The Iranian broadcast reported 1,500 Iraqi soldiers were killed
and 350 wounded in fighting with Revolutionary Guards for control
of Lake Darbandikhan, high in the Kurdistan mountains.
   The Iranian agency said 20 tanks and armored vehicles were
destroyed and 15 captured when Iranian troops beat back an abortive
Iraqi counter-attack.
   It said Revolutionary Guards captured the Shaakh Shamshir
Heights overlooking a big hydroelectric dam on the southernmost
point of the 10-mile long Lake Darbandikhan.
   The facility provides most of the power for the region as well
as the capital Baghdad, 120 miles to the southeast.
   Tehran's communiques said Revolutionary Guards had battled to
within three miles of the dam. IRNA said the Revolutionary Guards
used speedboats to outflank Iraqi forces on the southern shore of
the lake while artillery and fighter-bombers pounded Iraqi
positions.
   Iraq acknowledged Saturday it has lost ground to the Iranians,
who say they have pushed 10 miles into Kurdistan.
   If Iranian claims are true, they are now 70 miles from Iraq's
Kirkuk oilfield, which accounts for 1.5 million barrels of oil a
day, more than half Iraq's oil production, vital for its war effort.
   In Baghdad, the official newspaper Al-Jumhouriya said in an
editorial: ``Iraq is determined to utilize all capabilities and
means to decimate the invaders and purge the land inch by inch.''
   Al-Thawra, another government newspaper, said: ``We defend
ourselves with all available means.''
   The editorials and a declaration Saturday by the ruling
Revolutionary Command Council hinted that Iraq had used chemicals
weapons that Iran claims killed about 5,000 Iraqi Kurds.
   The rebellious Kurds have long fought the Baghdad government for
autonomy.

   Security forces shot and killed four
people believed to be Kurdish guerrillas during a clash Sunday in
southeastern Turkey, the Anatolia news agency reported.
   The agency said the four were hiding in a cave and opened fire
on government troops searching the area near Bahce Hamlet in
Adiyaman province.
   Security forces found one G-3 automatic rifle, one Soviet-made
Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, three hand grenades and ammunition
in the cave, the agency said.
   Most guerrillas in the region are affiliated with the Kurdish
Labor Party, which seeks to establish a Marxist state in parts of
southeastern and eastern Turkey.
   About 700 civilians and military personnel and an equal number
of Kurdish rebels have been killed since the group began attacking
military targets and villages in August 1984.
   Ethnic Kurds make up one-fifth of Turkey's population of 52
million.

<TEXT>
   April Fools Day was the date of the first two
Save the Pun dinners, but Good Friday falls on April 1 this year,
causing ``mass'' confusion among punsters.
   ``Instead, the dinner is sharing April 4 with the `Oh! punning
day' of the Chicago White Sox,'' joked Joyce Heitler, the dinner's
organizer. ``We'll both have a ball.''
   Heitler is head of the Chicago chapter of the International Save
the Pun Foundation.
   ``Why save the pun? Because it's in danger of extinction,'' she
said.
   But Heitler made it clear during an interview Saturday that the
pun still is very much alive, at least in her conversation.
   ``We'll have everything on the menu from soup to nuts, but we
promise not to serve soup to nuts,'' Heitler said.
   ``We would have had alphabet soup but we didn't want guests
groping for words,'' she added.
   More than 200 punsters are expected to attend the dinner at
which the foundation will celebrate its 10th anniversary and
present its first Punster of the Year Award.
   ``We asked members to send us their votes, and there were a
great many votes for President Reagan. They feel America is safer
with a `ray gun' in the White House,'' said John Crosbie, founder
and chairman of the ``bored'' at the foundation, which he says has
78,000 members worldwide.
   Reagan didn't win, but the identity of the award's recipient is
being kept a secret until the dinner.
   Crosbie, a Toronto writer and marketing consultant, said in a
telephone interview Saturday from his Canadian home that there also
is a serious side to puns.
   ``Statistics tell us that one in five people in the United
States and Canada is functionally illiterate, and if we can get
kids to see the fun there is with words, we can get them interested
in reading,'' he said.
   ``Teachers and professors are using our newsletters in the
classroom and getting students to enjoy reading,'' said Crosbie,
who publishes a newsletter for punsters that costs $19 a year.
   Heitler, who teaches kindergarten at a Roman Catholic school on
the city's North Side, said her pupils like puns and she uses them
in the classroom.
   Heitler, who also works as a clown, magician and publicist,
thinks English is the best language for punsters because almost
every word has a double meaning and punsters delight in twisting
the language.
   While she acknowledges many people cannot stomach puns or
punsters, Heitler notes that punning has been around for centuries
and says the ranks of famous punsters include Groucho Marx,
Shakespeare and Queen Elizabeth I.
   ``Shakespeare had 1,062 puns in his plays,'' noted Crosbie.

   More than 7,000 residents were
evacuated and 14,000 ordered to stay indoors Sunday while Dutch
army explosives experts defused a huge bomb from World War II.
   No one was injured in the operation in a densely populated
residential district. Life returned to normal after authorities
removed the bomb's ignition shortly after 4 p.m.
   Sunday's $3.15 million operation involved more than 2,000 police
and city officials. It was the largest evacuation since 1953, when
massive floods in the southwestern Netherlands killed more than
1,700 people.
   At least 14 people were arrested for ignoring the order to stay
indoors.
   Authorities also vacated an indoor skating rink to accomodate up
to 700 pets whose owners insisted on their evacuation. But only
four cats, a dog and a handful of birds were taken there, said City
Hall spokesman Ben van der Schaaf.
   The 1,000-pound bomb was dropped by a Typhoon bomber of the
British Royal Air Force on Nov. 29, 1944, during what was meant to
be a precision raid on the local headquarters of the Nazi security
service, or Sicherheitsdienst.
   The building, 500 yards from the site of Sunday's operation in a
densely populated inner-city district, was only slightly damaged in
the raid, and most of the 61 killed were local residents.
   The RAF bomb tore into a back yard only a few yards from an
apartment block. It was soon forgotten and lay buried more than 30
feet deep until a resident reminded City Hall of its presence
during renovation work last May.
   All residents living within 300 yards of the bomb were
evacuated. Police searched their homes to make sure they were
empty, shut off gas and water mains and sealed front doors.
   All residents living 300 to 600 yards away were ordered to close
their doors and windows, draw their curtains and stay indoors.
   Two army explosives experts using a 50-yard rope then unscrewed
the ignition of the 5{-foot-long bomb, said their chief, Maj.
Adriaan Sprangemeijer.
   The tensest moment of the defusing operation came as the pair
had to leave their heavily armored cabin to pull out the ignition
with a pair of forceps, Sprangemeijer said.
   ``It's scary,'' said 16-year old Daniella Barto as she leafed
through a magazine at the Energy Hall sports center, where about
350 evacuees were spending the day.
   Daniella's father, Jozef Barto, said he remembered the 1944
bombing raid by four Typhoon squadrons of the RAF's 14th Wing.
   ``It was terrible (but) at least I came through O.K.,'' said
Barto, a 69-year-old retired bicycle repairman.
   Although the authorities had launched a massive media effort
weeks in advance of the operation, police said they had to break
open more than 100 homes of people who were not there and had not
handed in their keys in advance.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Figures Could Take a Defense Cue from Watergate
Burglars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As they fight a 23-count indictment, the key
figures in the Iran-Contra affair may take a cue from two Watergate
burglars and assert a ``good faith'' belief that the White House
gave them a lawful covert mission to perform.
   Bernard L. Barker and Eugenio R. Martinez paved the way for this
defense by winning reversal of their convictions for a burglary
they conducted on assignment from the Nixon White House.
   The 1976 appellate court ruling said the trial court erred by
preventing the two Watergate foot soldiers from putting forth the
``good faith'' defense at their trial.
   Daniel E. Schultz, the lawyer who represented Barker and
Martinez, said in an interview that Iran-Contra defendants Richard
V. Secord and Albert Hakim would have the best chance of asserting
the defense.
   Secord and Hakim were private businessmen recruited by a White
House aide, Oliver L. North, to secretly arm the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels when such assistance was banned by Congress and to arrange
for covert arms shipments to Iran, which were authorized by
President Reagan.
   Schultz said North also might be able to use the ``good faith''
defense because he has asserted that he received lawful directions
from his superiors _ his boss at the National Security Council,
John M. Poindexter, and the late CIA Director, William J. Casey.
   ``I never carried out a single act, not one ... in which I did
not have authority from my superiors,'' North told the
congressional Iran-Contra committees last July 7.
   The fourth defendant, Poindexter, would have a difficult time
using the defense, Schultz said. As North's boss at the NSC,
Poindexter was at a level where he was making decisions rather than
taking orders.
   In fact, Poindexter told Congress July 16 that he ``personally
approved'' the diversion of profits from the Iran arms sales to the
Contras and kept the decision from the president.
   ``Secord and Hakim have excellent arguments on a good faith
belief'' of participating in a lawful activity, said Joseph
diGenova, the former chief federal prosecutor for the District of
Columbia and now a private attorney.
   ``Their orders were from high government officials. It's clear
in cases like this that Hakim and Secord will be able to argue they
had authority to do this.
   ``The independent counsel will want to show their perception of
authority was skewed by their desire to make money.''
   The indictment accused the defendants of embezzling more than
$17 million from the arms sales to Iran _ the difference between
the $30 million paid by the Iranians and the $12.2 million turned
over to the U.S. government.
   The grand jury said the defendants conspired to ``secretly and
deceptively'' divert millions of dollars from those profits. The
indictment said that Secord, Hakim and North personally profited
from the diversion and that the Nicaraguan Contras received
assistance in violation of a congressional ban on such aid.
   Barker and Martinez were convicted in the September 1971
burglary at the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist, Dr. Louis
J. Fielding. Ellsberg was a former Defense Department official who
leaked the secret Pentagon Papers that were critical of the Vietnam
War.
   The two burglars were part of a secret White House unit _ known
as the plumbers _ that was established to investigate leaks of
classified information. They also were among the men who broke into
the Democratic Party offices in the Watergate building in
Washington.
   Barker was a former CIA operative, and Martinez was on a CIA
retainer when they were recruited for the Fielding burglary by a
White House official, E. Howard Hunt.
   After their conviction, they appealed successfully to the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. They argued the
trial judge erred when he refused to admit the defendants' claim of
a good faith reliance on Hunt's authority to assign them to a
lawful operation. After the reversal, the government declined to
retry the defendants, who had pleaded guilty and served time for
the Watergate break-in.
   In the 2-1 appellate opinion, Judge Malcolm Richard Wilkey
wrote, ``There was abundant evidence in the case from which the
jury could have found that the defendants honestly and reasonably
believed they were engaged in a top-secret national security
operation lawfully authorized by a government intelligence agency.''
   Schultz said that successful use of the good faith defense must
depend on the background and knowledge of the defendant asserting
it.
   In the Barker-Martinez case, the appellate court recognized that
the assignment from Hunt was entirely consistent with the
defendants' prior covert missions.
   ``Both testified at trial that they had no reason to question
Hunt's credentials,'' the appeals court said. ``He clearly worked
for the White House and had a well-known background with the CIA.
During the entire time they worked for the CIA, neither Barker nor
Martinez was ever shown any credentials by their superiors. Not
once did they receive written instructions. ...
   ``Nevertheless, they testified, their understanding was always
that those operations had been authorized by the government of the
United States.
   ``Hunt's instructions and actions were in complete accord with
what their previous experience had taught them to expect.''
   In the Iran-Contra case, Secord _ a retired Air Force major
general _ had expertise in covert missions. That prior experience,
including the way he received assignments, could determine if
``there was a red flag for him'' in the Iran-Contra affair, Schultz
said.
   Schultz said Poindexter would have a problem with the good faith
defense because the higher someone rises in job responsibility,
``the more suspect your claim of lack of knowledge'' about legality.
   ``North is somewhere in the upper middle,'' Schultz said. ``He's
not the legal adviser, he's an operational man. He can present a
very credible picture of someone who had every reason to believe''
the Iran-Contra decisions were lawful.
   If Hakim was not accustomed to covert operations, in which the
authority of the supervisor is rarely questioned, he may actually
have a weaker case, Schultz said. Without having received such
assignments, he could be expected to raise questions about
lawfulness, Schultz said.

<TEXT>
   Abraham Lincoln paid just $1,500 for
the only house he ever owned, but nearly 150 years later $2.2
million has been spent to fix it up before it's reopened to the
public this summer.
   ``Back at that time, he got a good buy for his money,'' said
Gentry Davis of the National Park Service. ``It was a corner lot
and a prime location with easy access to downtown.''
   A three-year renovation of Lincoln's two-story frame house will
enter its final phase Wednesday when workers remove a vinyl
polyester shroud that cloaked the structure and allowed restoration
to continue through the winter.
   Workers then will put the finishing touches on the exterior and
begin grading and landscaping.
   ``At this point, we're on budget, on time and on schedule,''
said Richard A. Lusardi, the park service's maintenance chief for
the project. ``It will be ready for the grand reopening June 16.''
   Once it reopens park service officials expect a tourist boom,
with the number of visitors swelling from the 500,000 average of
past years to as many as 1 million annually.
   Lincoln was 35, a prosperous lawyer and a former state
legislator considering a bid for Congress when he moved his family
into the house in 1844, five years after it was built.
   He and his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, and their four sons lived in
the house until 1861 when he moved to the White House.
   The house, administered by the park service since 1972, has
undergone several renovations, most recently in the 1950s, but the
current effort stresses historical accuracy.
   Features added after Lincoln left for Washington have been
removed. The park service has installed fire detection and
suppression systems, burglary monitors and humidity controls, but
they are neatly disguised.
   The exterior has been painted in an authentic color for the time
_ mocha brown. Insulation and a vapor barrier were installed in the
walls, which were replastered.
   The interior is being refurnished with exact reproductions of
wallpaper and rugs.
   ``The furniture had suffered ultraviolet light damage, and the
house had no air conditioning prior to the restoration, causing
glue joints to dry out and separate,'' said Larry Blake, the park
service's site chief for visitor services.
   ``Some additional period pieces are being added to fill out the
house. They are mostly knick-knacks and accessories on bureaus, for
example, to add a lived-in look.''
   To ensure the restoration is as accurate as possible, restorers
analyzed paint and reviewed records of shops where the family
bought household goods.
   ``It's almost like trying to solve a mystery,'' Blake said.
``You have to do a lot of detective work.''
   The finish on the woodwork, for example, was a very dark
varnish. But a paint analysis showed it should be off-white, and
the change has been made.
   ``Every day a new question comes up that doesn't have an easy
answer,'' said Davis, superintendent of the Lincoln Home for the
park service.
   One of the biggest surprises for restorers was the discovery of
a cache of documents inside a kitchen wall. The items, which will
be displayed at the house, date to the 16th president's days as a
congressman and include part of an envelope addressed and signed by
Lincoln, four letters to him and a printed anti-slavery speech.
   The cost of the renovation is being borne by taxpayers, not by
tourists. A stipulation in the will of Robert Lincoln, the
president's oldest son, who deeded the property to the state of
Illinois, prohibits visitors from being charged.

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration has spent more than
$70 million since 1981 trying to persuade America's teen-agers to
abstain from premarital sex _ a small sum in an era of
trillion-dollar budgets.
   But there's a problem, says American Civil Liberties Union
attorney Janet Benshoof. She charges the money from the Adolescent
Family Life Act is going to religious organizations to promote
their beliefs, a clear violation of the constitutional separation
of church and state.
   ``Our position is this is a statute which funds religious
organizations to teach sex education,'' said Benshoof, head of the
ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project.
   ``Since you can't fund these organizations to teach math, this
is unconstitutional. ... They're blatantly funding religious groups
to teach not only religion, but anti-abortion propaganda.''
   The federal Department of Health and Human Services disagrees,
and the case goes before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday. The
arguments indirectly pit the ACLU against President Reagan, an
outspoken proponent of what he once called ``my Adolescent Family
Life Program.''
   A decision in the case is expected some time before the court's
July 3 summer break. It should provide a first look at newly
appointed Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's views on family life
questions.
   Currently 82 organizations split $10 million in federal money
under the program. Each applicant's program is reviewed for
religious content before funds are shipped; more than half is spent
to assist pregnant teens.
   At least one organization has lost its funds in the past three
years for crossing the bounds out of the secular domain.
   The Adolescent Family Life Program has been under fire since
1983, two years after the bill was sponsored by former Alabama Sen.
Jeremiah Denton and quickly approved by Congress.
   Denton, a staunch Reagan Republican, believed it provided an
alternative to Planned Parenthood and could reduce teen-age
pregnancies, but opponents derisively termed it the ``federal
chastity act.'' Denton said he feels the act's goals are still
valid.
   ``There should be a place, if the federal government gets
involved as it has with Planned Parenthood, which permits a
church-affiliated group to work with a child,'' he said, adding he
was disheartened the case had gone this far.
   ``It's OK to say no,'' Denton continued. ``I don't think it's a
right-wing nut idea. I just hope the idea doesn't go away.''
   The program's impact around the country is uncertain. Figures
from the National Institute for Adolescent Pregnancies indicate the
number of annual teen-age pregnancies remained at about 1 million
for 1986 and again in 1987.
   In legal briefs filed in the Supreme Court action, the
government acknowledged some ``serious problems'' in the
church-state area of the family life program, but claimed they have
been corrected. There was no further on-the-record comment from the
government.
   ``It is in litigation, and we have a policy about not commenting
on cases in litigation,'' said Nabers Cabaniss, deputy assistant
secretary for population affairs in Health and Human Services.
   Through it all the bill has never lost the support of Reagan,
who called a U.S. District Court decision which struck down the
program as ``a perversion of the First Amendment,'' which mandates
separation of church and state.
   Benshoof, in turn, blames Reagan for much of her organization's
busy schedule over the past eight years.
   ``Since 1980, Reagan has obviously used his power over executive
agencies to implement anti-abortion laws, whether or not Congress
has approved them,'' she said.
   As evidence, she pointed to a case still in litigation involving
Health and Human Services regulations issued Jan. 29 which limit
access to information about abortion at more than 4,000 federally
funded family planning clinics.
   The changes violate the First Amendment and turn health
officials into ``mouthpieces for the Reagan administration's
anti-abortion ideology,'' she charged when filing suit against the
regulations.

<HEAD>City's Stinky Reputation Expected To Change In Wake Of New Odor
Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This northeastern Florida city has a
booming economy, a revitalized downtown and an active community
leadership. And now a new ordinance may help reduce its stench.
   ``If there's one issue that transcends this city, rich and poor,
black and white, it's the odor issue,'' said first-term Mayor Tommy
Hazouri. ``Odor is the only issue keeping us from being a
world-class city.''
   Few of the city's 610,000 residents, who've lived with the
industrial odor for four decades, would argue that the air needs
cleaning.
   ``I'll tell you exactly what the air smells like. It's like
being locked in a Port-O-Let at the county fair. There's no
escape,'' said homeowner Jeanne Oster.
   ``You never get used to it,'' said Yellow Cab driver Joe Greene.
``I pick people up in my cab at the airport and coming down
(Interstate) 95 the smell hits them, and it gets real quiet and I
think to myself, `... I wonder if they think I belched wrong.'''
   Hazouri has made a stink about the stench in his eight months in
office, demoting the city's pollution control chief, hiring eight
more odor fighters, pumping up his legal staff to take polluters to
court and forming a smell strike force with Duval State Attorney Ed
Austin.
   And last Tuesday, the City Council passed Hazouri's anti-odor
bill.
   Violations of the law can be criminal offenses punishable by up
to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine, or civil cases with penalties
of up to $10,000. The law also levies $50 fines for 41 other
offenses.
   ``This ordinance will get the job done,'' the mayor said.
   The mayor blames the lion's share of odor on two pulp mills _
Seminole Kraft and Jefferson Smurfit _ and three chemical plants _
SCM-Glidco Organics, Reichhold and Union Camp.
   But the companies say they have spent millions on odor control
and are being picked on.
   ``The administration has zeroed in on the pulp mills and
chemical plants as the bad guys,'' said Seminole Kraft general
manager Frank Lee, adding that the firm has spent $7 million at the
plant to control odors. ``But there are other contributors,
including landfills and sewage plants.
   ``The mayor's concept is so motherhood and apple pie. No
right-thinking person would ever say, `I'm for odor.' But pulp
mills have always had odor problems and always will,'' Lee said.
``If the mayor has his way completely, I don't think the pulp mills
and chemical companies could stay open.''
   Under the new law, if five people in five households complain of
a smell and an inspector can validate the complaints and track the
odor down, the city can impose fines.
   ``You may as well call it The Lawyer's Relief Act of 1988,''
George Robbins, president of SCM-Glidco, said of the new ordinance.
``What's `objectionable' odor? If you get five guys together and
they complain about the smell of hamburgers coming out of a
McDonald's, is the city going to fine McDonald's $10,000?''

<HEAD>Survey Finds Top Campus Jobs Go to Married Men, Single Women</HEAD>

   A survey of college presidents indicates women
may have trouble combining marriage with a climb to the top of the
academic ladder.
   In a survey released Sunday by the American Council on
Education, 90 percent of male college presidents but only 35
percent of the female presidents said they were married.
   Excluding nuns, priests and other members of religious orders,
it said, ``the difference ... narrows somewhat. Among the lay
presidents, 93 percent of men but 49 percent of women were
married.''
   The women presidents were more likely to be divorced _ 11
percent compared with 3 percent of the men.
   The survey indicated the typical college president is white,
male, married and 53 years old.
   The council sent questionnaires in 1986 to all 2,822 accredited
higher education institutions and got replies back from 2,105
presidents.
   Two hundred, or 9.5 percent, were women and 148, or 7 percent,
were minorities, including 100 black presidents, 37 Hispanics,
eight Asians and three American Indians.
   The council's report on its survey, called ``The American
College President: A Contemporary Profile,'' concluded, ``The image
of who shall occupy the chief executive office is clearly still a
traditional one.''
   Madeleine Green, vice president of the council and director of
its Center for Leadership Development, said the data raise
interesting questions that will be addressed in future studies.
   ``Are family and career at the highest levels incompatible for
women? Are married women less likely to be selected or less likely
to want a presidency?'' she asked. She also questioned whether it
is harder for single men to become college presidents.
   Other findings:
   _Four out of 10 women were presidents of women's colleges.
   _Only 2 percent of predominantly white institutions were headed
by blacks.
   _Fourteen percent of the presidents were over 70 years old. Only
4 percent were 40 or younger.
   _More than half were Protestants. Twenty-three percent were
Catholic and 3 percent Jewish. Thirteen percent said they were
something else; 5.5 percent gave no answer.
   _Husbands of college presidents were twice as likely to be
employed as compared with wives of college presidents.
   _More than three quarters of the presidents held doctorates.

<TEXT>
   A wild bash celebrating the 100th
anniversary of the cherished cable cars 15 years ago was so much
fun, San Francisco is doing it again.
   Any excuse for a party goes in this town, and the excuse Monday
is the centennial of the Powell Street lines, the picturesque
junior circuit to the older California Street line.
   The city marked 100 years of tipsy trolleys in 1973 with 11 days
of parades, nightly parties, speeches and plenty of jazz. In these
more austere times, the occasion will be marked by a single parade,
a $40-a-plate benefit lunch for the homeless, 15,000 balloons and a
giant birthday cake.
   Presidents on the campaign trail, movie stars on location and
millions of tourists and San Franciscans have rumbled up and down
Powell during the past century, enjoying breathtaking vistas on
some of the city's steepest slopes. One of the lines climbs past
Chinatown to Fisherman's Wharf, with a view of famed Alcatraz
island.
   During the years, there were spectacular accidents and annoying
breakdowns, and dramatic changes as neighborhoods shifted from one
ethnic group to another and buildings went up and came down.
   Through it all, the cable cars groaned and squeaked along the
hills at 9{ mph. The two Powell Street lines now carry about 41,000
passengers a day.
   ``You could have seen a lot of change from these cars over the
past 100 years,'' says gripman Phillip Shaw, who's seen his share
in 26 years plying Powell. ``Only the hills stay the same.''
   Shaw worked the gears and clanged the bells for Presidents
Eisenhower and Nixon, but wasn't around when Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev came for a ride in 1959.
   Fellow gripman John Shipman, a 15-year veteran, says the job
``never gets dull. It's the same line but every trip is different
because of the people. It's an adventure. Besides, I'm a skier so I
love the hills. The steeper the better.''
   Hyde and Mason Streets, where the two lines run, are just right
for him, with 12-degree grades in some spots.
   Powell Street is where perennial bell-ringing champ Carl Payne
chimes through town, delighting riders with his melodies. At night,
when fog creeps over the city, there isn't a more soulful sound
than the muffled peals of a cable car bell.
   The Powell-Mason line opened a few months before incandescent
lamps made their debut in the city at the Bijou Theater. Today the
path of the maroon, gold and white trolleys is aglow with lights.
   In earlier days, Humphrey Bogart hopped aboard the Powell-Hyde
line as the man with the new face in ``Dark Passage,'' and author
Dashiell Hammett stepped on near John's Grill.
   The Great Earthquake and fire of 1906 destroyed most of the
tracks and the lines' powerhouse and barn, but 27 cars outside the
fire zone survived unscathed and the line was restored.
   The cable cars became symbols of this frontier city's eccentric
and indefatigable spirit, enchanting tourists and winning the
hearts of many San Franciscans.
   When bureaucrats, bus companies and unenchanted citizens
complained over the years about accidents and inefficiency, cable
car boosters have joined to save the lines from destruction.
   The most vocal and earnest was Freidel Klussman, a neighborhood
mover and shaker who will be remembered Monday when Mayor Art Agnos
proclaims it ``Freidel Klussman Day.''

   Domino's Pizza promises delivery in 30
minutes or less, but some of the nation's neighborhoods are so
violent the company won't let its drivers venture into them.
   ``It's not worth risking a driver for a $10 pizza,'' said Robert
Rutick, night manager for the Domino's store in Irvington.
   At least three Domino's drivers were killed last year.
   Recent incidents such as a driver being robbed of a pizza at
gunpoint and the throwing of rocks and bottles at cars led to the
cutting off of night service to parts of Irvington, just west of
Newark, where some neighborhoods are so dangerous they've never had
any service.
   ``The only times we stop delivery to an area is when there have
been a number of incidents,'' said Rutick.
   Delivery constitutes the majority of Domino's Pizza sales, with
only a small amount of take-out business. Many Domino's outlets
around the nation do not offer any eat-in service.
   In Camden, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, service
is limited to only a few well-lighted areas with round-the-clock
security like hospitals and the Rutgers University campus, said
Robert Lermanis, night manager for a store that serves parts of
Camden and Burlington counties.
   ``Many drivers are leery of delivering into Camden because it's
a high-crime area,'' Lermanis said. ``We couldn't get anybody to
work here if we went into Camden.''
   Customers whose areas are cut off are told they can always come
to the store to pick up a pizza, said Dennis Obert, security
director for the Domino's region that includes Southern California,
Hawaii, Arizona and Nevada.
   One driver was killed in Obert's region last year when three
gang members confronted him after he delivered a pizza in San
Bernardino, Calif.
   John Gomez, night manager for a store in San Bernardino, said
the crime rate in the city 50 miles east of Los Angeles is
``staggering,'' even compared with his native New York City.
   ``Most of my drivers are scared anyway,'' Gomez said. ``But I
understood myself coming from a low-income family that those people
deserve the same service as the rest of the city. We just have to
tell them because of the area we can't deliver at night.''
   Domino's policy is not shared by at least one of the national
parcel delivery services, but they would not normally deliver at
night.
   ``We have no company policy against not delivering to certain
areas,'' said Betty Todd, a customer service agent at Federal
Express' regional headquarters in Memphis, Tenn. ``Our couriers
deliver to the address on the package.
   ``Our couriers don't carry money. It's not like pizza deliverers
who might have $25 on them to make change.''
   United Parcel Service offices in Newark and New York City were
closed Sunday and officials could not be reached for comment.
   In Chicago, Domino's manager Donnie Crown said he won't allow
drivers in certain large areas.
   ``The cops didn't tell us not to go there _ it's just common
sense,'' Crown said, citing incidents where delivery people had
been robbed at gunpoint.
   Ron Hingst, a spokesman for the main Domino's office in Ann
Arbor, Mich., said there was about one security-related incident
for every 400,000 deliveries last year.
   Domino's has a 3-year-old program of having a security director
in each of its 13 regions to teach delivery people and managers
ways to avoid becoming a crime victim.
   Such advice includes being wary of telephone numbers with a
fourth digit of eight or nine, which usually indicates the call was
placed from a telephone booth.
   In some instances, police have posed as drivers to capture
would-be assailants in areas where a rash of attacks and robberies
have occurred.
   However, Obert said, ``Most departments don't have the time.''
   Two people were killed in the company's Southeast region last
year, said Larry Jerue, regional head of security in Atlanta.
   In one case in Vicksburg, Miss., a delivery man was killed after
being robbed of two pizzas and $4. Five people apparently disposed
of the body and spent the money on beer to go with the pizza,
investigators said.
   ``We kind of mirror society,'' Jerue said. ``Violent crime is
going up and, unfortunately, we've had drivers shot and killed.''

   Shepard Nevel's opponents to be
national convention delegates for Michael Dukakis from Florida's
18th congressional district had the name recognition and
experience. But Nevel had the energy, the buses and the chicken
salad on rye.
   The 28-year-old assistant Dade County attorney won a trip to the
Democratic national convention in Atlanta in July with a landslide
margin in a 14-candidate field.
   Florida Democrats met in caucuses Saturday in the state's 19
congressional districts to select people to represent the
presidential candidates who earned delegates in the March 8
primary. The low-key atmosphere of the caucuses was in marked
contrast to the excitement and media hype of Super Tuesday.
   ``There's not the same Adrenalin and excitement about this that
there was about Super Tuesday,'' Nevel said, comparing the caucuses
to the mixed doubles coming after the men's championship at
Wimbledon.
   Nevel, president of the Dade County Young Democrats Club, had
some secret weapons _ veteran Miami Beach get-out-the-vote
organizer Harry Mildner and his father Joseph Nevel, a civic
activist and owner of the famed Wolfie's delicatessen.
   The number of delegates for each presidential candidate was
decided by the popular vote March 8. But delegates weren't listed
on that ballot.
   The popular vote in the 18th District _ which includes Miami
Beach, heavily Latin Hialeah and a predominantly black section of
Miami and is represented by 87-year-old Rep. Claude Pepper _ gave
Dukakis two delegates and Jesse Jackson one.
   Nevel, who has been doing volunteer work in political campaigns
since 1976 but had never been a delegate, faced opponents for the
Dukakis slots including Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez, two state
legislators, a popular former lawmakers and two city commissioners.
   ``They will win on name recognition. I'm hoping that I'll be
more motivated than they are,'' Nevel said as he ate breakfast
early Saturday.
   Nevel had picked Dukakis a year earlier. Although he disagrees
with Dukakis on foreign policy issues such as not aiding Nicaraguan
Contra rebels, he admires the Massachusetts governor's progressive
social record.
   Nevel hosted a $30-a-head fund raiser for Dukakis and co-hosted
a $250 fund raiser later. He also volunteered six to eight hours a
week, organizing and working telephone banks.
   Soon after the Super Tuesday results were known, Nevel shifted
his attention to the delegate race. One problem was most of his
fellow Young Democrats and professional colleagues live in
more-suburban districts.
   He, Miami Beach activist Evelyn Manset and Ray Zeller, head of
the South Dade Democrat club and running to be the district's one
alternate, formed a coalition to run as a slate.
   Next, Nevel enlisted Mildner, president of the Miami Beach
Retirees Inc. with whom Nevel worked closely in turning out Beach
voters for Dukakis on March 8. They worked the telephones,
contacting some 200 potential supporters.
   Nevel and Ms. Manset each chartered a bus, costing some $200
each. They had paper ``palm cards'' with their slate printed up to
hand out.
   Nevel's father made up buttons and stickers for his son.
   And he threw in several dozen deli sandwiches.
   The buses began pickups at six elderly-dominated apartment
buildings across Miami Beach at 9 a.m.
   A few stops later, with 45 supporters on board, Nevel took the
bus intercom to explain the caucus system. The supporters would be
asked to produce proof they were registered Democrats, fill out a
form stating they supported Dukakis, then proceed to an auditorium
for the actual voting.
   At the auditorium, delegate ballots were handed out and marked.
Afterward, Nevel's supporters got their lunch.
   Mayer Levy, a retiree from New York's East Side, recalled the
Tammany Hall era. ``They (the big-city political bosses) would get
us cock-eyed on all the beer we wanted, then they told us to vote
early and vote often.''
   Lillian Alderson, also from New York, said she liked Nevel, but
she also liked the free lunch. ``I waited an hour for the bus.
Shows how greedy we are,'' she said, laughing.
   Then the results came in. Nevel won in a landslide with 92
votes, 68 ahead of his nearest competitor. Ms. Manset and Zeller
also won.
   Nevel reflected: ``When I think back to what a longshot Dukakis
was a year ago and then to what a longshot I was, and now to be
going to the convention...''

   A moderate earthquake rocked northwestern
Greece and southern Albania, causing panic and some damage but no
injuries, authorities said Sunday.
   A spokeswoman for the Athens Seismological Institute said the
quake measured 5.2 on the Richter scale and was centered on the
western Albanian coast, 236 miles northwest of Athens.
   It struck at 9:35 p.m. Saturday.
   The official Albanian news agency ATA said the quake was felt in
seven Albanian districts and caused unspecified damage.
   ``The earth really moved. Most people stayed indoors, but some
panicked and ran into the streets expecting a second quake,'' said
a police spokesman on the western resort island of Corfu.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.An earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage and 6
severe damage.

<TEXT>
   The Navy's Trident II program to build a
newer, more deadly submarine-launched missile is ``sound, stable
and disciplined,'' according to a review released Sunday by the
House Armed Services Committee.
   In rare praise for a U.S. nuclear weapons program, the
Democratic-controlled panel said the Trident II, scheduled to enter
service in about 18 months, appears to be on time and under budget.
   ``The other programs we've looked at had a variety of problems,
so this is kind of a man-bites-dog story, but it is important to
give credit when it is due,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman
of the panel.
   The committee's report was the latest in a series of studies on
U.S. nuclear weapons programs, but it was the first in which the
panel praised the Pentagon.
   The Trident II, also known as the D-5, is a submarine-launched
weapon that will be put aboard Trident submarines starting next
year. It has a longer range and is more accurate than the Trident I
weapon it will replace.
   Although the Trident weapons comprise a growing portion of the
U.S. nuclear arsenal, they have generally escaped the controversy
that has enveloped President Reagan's programs to build new
land-based nuclear missiles and long-range bombers. After a series
of cost overruns early in the Trident program, few problems have
surfaced.
   The committee's review singled out for praise the Navy's
Strategic Systems Program Office (SSPO), saying it has ``a well-run
program.''
   ``We've some elements of what the SSPO is doing in other
programs, but not as many as we're seeing in this one program,''
Aspin said.
   For instance, Aspin said, the office is managing
weapons-building programs longer and has more wide-ranging
authority than other Pentagon offices.
   The Trident II will cost at least $36 billion, but the eventual
cost is unclear because the Navy hasn't finally decided how many of
the Trident missile-firing subs it will build.
   Congress has already authorized 15 of the boats, which each
carry a dozen missiles that can carry up to eight warheads each.
   The Trident II missile is now being flight-tested at Cape
Canaveral, Fla. Eight of the nine scheduled tests have been
finished and the results show seven successful shots, one failure,
and one delay. The failure has delayed the program, but there is
enough flexibility in the schedule so that the missile is still
expected to be completed on time, the report said.
   While the House report praised the Navy, it said that technical
difficulties have been discovered in the inertial measurement unit,
the part of the guidance system that directs the weapon to its
target.
   Aspin has been sharply critical of the Air Force because of
inertial measurement unit problems in the MX nuclear-tipped
missile, but the situation is not as serious in the case of the
Trident, he said. The two weapons use different units.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 12.3 million cars, trucks, vans and
motorcycles valued at $52 billion were stolen over a 13-year
period, the federal government estimated Sunday.
   After recovery of about 65 percent of them, losses were
estimated at $29 billion in 1985 dollars.
   Insurance payments reduced actual losses to vehicle owners to an
estimated $16.1 billion, according to an analysis of the Bureau of
Justice Statistics National Crime Surveys for the years 1973
through 1985.
   The number of thefts per 1,000 registered vehicles fell 33
percent over the surveyed period, from nine to just six, the bureau
concluded in an analysis of its semiannual surveys of more than
40,000 households nationwide.
   Over the period, the number of estimated vehicle thefts per
1,000 households also declined, by 21 percent, from 13.3 in 1973 to
10.5 in 1985.
   In addition to the vehicle thefts during the period, there were
an estimated 7 million attempted thefts, said BJS director Steven
Schlesinger. About 64 percent of those were not reported to police,
he said, and 13 percent of the actual vehicle thefts also went
unreported.
   Half of the thefts involved a loss of $2,455 or more before
recoveries and insurance payments. About 10 percent involved losses
of $10,000 or more.
   The vehicle stolen in 76 percent of the cases surveyed was a
car. The rest were trucks, vans and motorcycles.
   In 7 percent of the completed thefts, the vehicle was in a
garage at home. Thefts most often took place at night and in
parking lots, on the street or near the victim's home.
   The most likely to be victimized by car theft were blacks,
Hispanics, households headed by people under age 25, people in
multiple-dwelling units, central city residents and low-income
households.
   Those least likely to be victims were people 55 years and older,
homeowners and rural residents.
   Stu Smith, bureau spokesman, said the report was based on a new
computer analysis of the extensive crime surveys the statistics
bureau conducts every six months.
   He said officials believe the statistics are more accurate than
police reports because they are based on actual interviews with
people in the households surveyed and cover crimes not reported to
the police.

   Renato Salvatori, the former lifeguard who became a
star of the Italian cinema, died Sunday at his home in Rome after a
fighting a liver disease for a year and a half. He was 55.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said Salvatori, who had retired
from acting, suffered from cirrhosis of the liver, the same disease
that afflicted his father.
   Salvatori was working as a lifeguard on an Italian beach in 1951
when he was discovered by director Luciano Emmer and given a role
in ``The Children of Piazza Di Spagna.''
   That movie began a film career that included, among many others,
Dino Risi's ``Poor But Pretty,'' Luchino Viscoti's ``Rocco And His
Brothers'' and Francesco Rosi's ``The Peddlers.''
   Salvatori will be buried Wednesday in the tomb of his family in
the cemetery of Querceto. He is survived by two children.

   It was strictly a borderline affair, but
the newlyweds didn't seem to mind. After all, the bride hails from
Arkansas and the groom from Texas.
   Saturday night's wedding of Gayle Nichols, 31, and Wayne
Burkland, 40, took place in front of the downtown post office,
which straddles the border between the two states.
   A couple of steps down the aisle, er, sidewalk, and the knot
would have been tied in Texas.
   Both Burkland and his new wife are postal employees.
   ``We always wanted to get married here,'' Burkland said after
the ceremony.
   ``Under the stars,'' his bride added.
   Ms. Nichols is a native of El Dorado, Ark., 90 miles east of
this border town. Burkland hails from New Boston, Texas, 25 miles
to the west.
   Miller County, Ark., Justice of the Peace H.Q. Russell was
unflappable as he officiated. Russell said it was the third wedding

   Soon, Boston cab riders will be able to ``reach
out and touch someone'' even while sitting in traffic.
   Nynex Mobile Communications Corp. will begin installing the
first 20 car phone units in Independent Taxi Operators Association
cabs Monday, Nynex Vice President Peter Harrigan said.
   Another firm, Downer Communications, also reported similar
negotations with the Red & White Cab Association and the Boston Cab
Co.
   ``With a half-hour trip facing him, we think that a stockbroker
on his way to work may well want to place a call to Hong Kong on
his way to execute an early trade,'' said president Charles W.
Downer.
   The cost of a two-minute local call will start at $3.50 to
$3.70, well above the 10-cent charge on a Boston street pay phone.
And long distance connections will cost more. Charges will be
payable by credit card.
   Nynex and Downer plan to pay cab operators a percentage of the
local call charge. The cabs will be marked so prospective riders
can tell they are equipped with telephones, which will carry only
outgoing calls.
   Similar telephones were tried last year in a few British cabs,
and several were installed in ``black car'' taxis in New York City,
which are barred from picking up fares on the street.
   Each unit costs $1,500 to $2,000, but Downer believes they could
make a profit on a few calls a day.

   Key West has the best blow-hards in the
business, judging from results of the island's 26th Annual Conch
Shell Blowing Contest.
   Tooters from 3 to 58 competed Saturday, and when the noise died
down, the hometown favorites had swept the contest over visiting
tourists.
   As legend has it, conch blowing dates back hundreds of years in
the Florida Keys, to the days when Calusa Indians and pirates who
lived here used the shells for communication. A toot was a signal
of survival or distress.
   The best blowers of the tightly coiled shells, all from Key
West, were Joshua Gabbard, 5; Christopher Vargas, 8; Jeffrey
Roberson, 11 and Steve Hoyt, 35.
   Conch, a food staple from northern Brazil to Bermuda, is found
throughout the Caribbean and lower Florida Keys. They are most
popular in fritters, chowders and salads.

   The race for the White House focuses for
a week on Wisconsin, as Democrat Jesse Jackson rolls into the
traditionally liberal-voting state on the heels of a stunning
triumph in next-door Michigan and Michael Dukakis urgently needs to
ignite some excitement.
   George Bush looked on the verge of sweeping the Republican
primary almost by default as Bob Dole's campaign withered.
   Wisconsin's primary is a week from Tuesday, on April 5, and the
state has an importance outstripping its 81 Democratic delegates at
stake.
   Connecticut's primary Tuesday was the next event on the
presidential calender. But Bush, in another of his ``home states,''
had it sewn up in the GOP balloting. Dukakis' strength in a state
that borders his home of Massachusetts reduced the stakes there for
the other Democrats.
   For Democrat Richard Gephardt, the road to the White House may
have ended in Milwaukee, where he spoke to state Democrats late
Saturday night knowing that his poor third-place finish in Michigan
hadn't come close to the showing he had needed to sustain a
credible candidacy.
   He went home to Washington by private jet, accompanied only by
his wife and a few aides, to consider his next move.
   ``All things considered, I'd rather be back in Des Moines,''
said Gephardt, who won Iowa's lead-off caucuses seven weeks ago but
was unable to capitalize on it elsewhere.
   Aides said beforehand that without a victory in Michigan he
would drop out and seek re-election to Congress from Missouri.
   Wisconsin presents a contest of major importance for the two
other Democrats, Paul Simon and Albert Gore Jr.
   Gore was investing heavily in television ads in Wisconsin and
has already been on the air in the state for a week. The Tennessee
senator has yet to break out of single digits since the campaign
left the South, and his strategists were hoping the state would
return him to the top ranks of contenders just before the giant New
York primary on April 19, when 255 Democratic delegates are at
stake.
   ``I need your help and I'm here to ask for it,'' Gore said as he
stumped in the state over the weekend.
   For Simon, Wisconsin offered a perhaps final chance to get back
into the race. His hopes turn on whether the state, whose history
of liberal primary winners includes Eugene McCarthy in 1968 and
George McGovern in 1972, will embrace Simon's campaign as the
unapologetic, traditional liberal.
   There was little sign that it would, however, as Simon was out
of money and Jackson emerged from Michigan with a major win as the
liberal candidate. Although Wisconsin is only 4 percent black,
Jackson was likely to exceed the 10 percent he gained in the state
in 1984.
   Jackson's virtual 2-1 victory in Michigan over Dukakis was a
strong blow to the Massachusetts governor, heretofore the
frontrunner, who many Democrats had been depicting as the
inevitable nominee once the race moved into the ethnic and
industrial Northern states where he should do well.
   That argument of inevitability became harder to sustain after a
third place finish in Illinois and a distant second in Michigan.
   ``In some sense, it's a lot of poetry,'' Jackson said in
Milwaukee, the results still coming in from Michigan where George
Wallace won 16 years earlier. ``It's a lot of history. We also have
the numbers, and it's a lot of reality.''
   Republican Dole had looked to Wisconsin as a chance to recoup,
and he stumped the state last week. But he also was hinting he may
quit before Wisconsin's primary and said Bush's nomination was ``a
foregone conclusion.''
   The only recent poll, conducted by the Milwaukee Journal 11 days
ago, gave Bush the lead over Dole by better than 2-1. Among
Democrats, Dukakis had 38 percent to Jackson's 30 percent, with the
rest far behind.
   Wisconsin's primary is an open event, so Republicans could cross
over to vote in the more competitive Democratic race. It has been
unkind to frontrunners, as Walter Mondale lost here to Gary Hart in
a 1984 popular vote that did not award delegates.

<TEXT>
   Samuel C. Koupchik, a fixture in the Massachusetts
Statehouse for generations and the basis for a character in the
novel ``The Last Hurrah,'' has died at the age of 89.
   Koupchik, who died Friday after suffering a heart attack, spent
his days around the document room of the Statehouse, handing out
legislative calendars to reporters and lobbyists, working as a
runner for lobbyists and occasionally giving free political advice.
   He was an honorary member of both the House and the Senate,
where a memorial service was planned Monday.
   A native of Russia, he began working as a 10-year-old errand boy
for a city political leader. He went on to a series of city and
state jobs _ including interpreter, ferry worker, constable and
member of the Boston election, street and law departments.
   He spent 25 years as a mail carrier for the Registry of Motor
Vehicles and had been an aide to the late Gov. James Michael Curley.
   In the novel ``The Last Hurrah'' by Edwin O'Connor, the
character of Ditto was based on Koupchik.
   ``Sammy represented a bygone era of politics when loyalty was
the most valued of all principles,'' House Speaker George Keverian
said through a spokesman. ``He like to tell and repeated often
stories recalling acts of loyalty by the political kingpins of his
day. He'll be missed. There are no more Sammy Koupchiks.''
   Koupchik was never married and is survived by six nephews and a
niece.

<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan exiles bowed their heads in a
special outdoors Palm Sunday Mass and prayed that last week's
Contra-Sandinista cease-fire pact is not Sandinista treachery.
   ``The general feeling is confusion, what will happen now in
Nicaragua,'' said Roberto Serrano, an engineer who has worked as a
Medley wine importer since leaving his homeland. ``We have to wait
and see.''
   He and more than 300 Nicaraguan exiles gathered in Ronselli Park
in this Nicaraguan exile enclave, to pray with exiled Monsignor
Pablo Antonio Vega.
   ``We want peace in Nicaragua, but we don't believe we have
enough guarantees to go back, for we believe the Sandinistas don't
like to be at peace inside Nicaragua,'' said Eduardo Salgado.
   The Nicaragua Civic Union, which represents some Nicaragua exile
groups, called the Mass to show solidarity, Salgado said.
   The gathering in this western Dade County city, home of ``Little
Managua,'' came a day after about 200 peace demonstrators applauded
the cease-fire pact in downtown Miami and a handful of
demonstrators blasted it outside a Miami hotel where Contra leaders
were holding closed-door meetings.
   Under the agreement, which declares a cease-fire until June 1,
the Contras have agreed not to accept any more U.S. military aid.
In return, the leftist Sandinistas promised a gradual amnesty for
Contras and unrestricted freedom of expression that would allow
them a role in Nicaragua's political process.
   ``No matter what we (as individuals) believe in, there's only
one ideal that prevails _ to keep on the struggle of the Nicaraguan
people until the Soviets and communist Cubans leave Nicaragua,''
said Manuel Molina. ``The Sandinistas are no problem to us because
they are a very small group of criminals. But the Soviet force,
that's a whole different ball game.''
   The peace pact also has divided the 54-member Nicaraguan
Resistance assembly. In a special six-hour session Saturday, it
created a commission to monitor its five directors when they resume
negotiations with the Sandinistas this week.
   The assembly, which represents nine Nicaraguan political
opposition groups, was formed last year and has the right to
overrule its directors.
   Assembly leaders said the 60-day cease-fire pact, signed
Wednesday in Nicaragua by directors Adolfo Calero and Aristides
Sanchez, is only the first step in ending the seven-year civil war.
   ``If we don't get (freedom) through negotiations, we'll get it
through war,'' Calero said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet The Press.''
   ``We will not disband and we will not lay down our weapons,'' he
said.
   At Saturday's meeting, former Nicaraguan Vice President Silvio
Arguello said the formation of the negotiation watchdog committee
was not meant to rebuke the directors who completed the cease-fire
pact. Its purpose will be to see that exiles' hopes to reclaim a
life in Nicaragua are not compromised.
   However, Arguello said the Contra directors have lost touch with
the exile community.

<TEXT>
   A man wielding an ax and knife burst
into a worship service Sunday and seriously wounded three
congregation members, police said.
   The attacker slit a woman's throat, sliced another woman's hand
and bashed a man over the head with the ax, according to LBC, a
London radio station. He then sped away in a car and set fire to
his home before he was arrested, police said.
   Police were unsure of a motive in the attack on the Pentecostal
service in central Reading, 35 miles west of London.
   About 20 worshipers, some in blood-splattered clothes, escaped
harm as they dived to the floor, witnesses said.
   Worshiper Golburne Vaughan said the attack came without warning
after the group had gathered at a community center for the Church
of God and Christ United service.
   ``Suddenly, a man came in carrying an ax and went straight to
one man, hitting him on the head,'' he said. ``Most of the people
were middle-aged, and we all dived under chairs and tried to hide.
There was blood everywhere as three people were chopped with the ax
or stabbed. It was all over very quickly.''
   A 54-year-old woman whose throat was slit was reported in
critical condition at a local hospital. The other victims, a
31-year-old man and a 30-year-old woman, were reported in stable
condition. Authorities did not identify them immediately.
   Police were questioning a 46-year-old suspect, said Inspector
Jim Reilly of the Thames Valley Police Force. The man had not been
charged.
   Reilly said he didn't know if the attacker knew his victims.

   The friends of a missionary slain in
South Africa say his commitment to justice and dignity will be
remembered best where it is needed most.
   ``The Rev. Wayne Steinert is not dead,'' Menardo Gomez, bishop
of the Lutheran Church in El Salvador, said at a memorial service
here Saturday at Riverside Community Church.
   ``He lives in Africa, Swaziland. In Paraguay and in El Salvador,
where we will remember him and follow his example, Wayne Peter
Steinert is present.''
   Steinert, 41, was shot and killed March 2 in Piet Retief, a city
just across the border of Swaziland in the South African province
of Transvaal, while traveling to meet a group of church members in
Lesotho. A South African was held for questioning, but few details
of the incident have come to light.
   The Rev. Stephen Lusk, minister of Riverside and a friend of
Steinert's, said Steinert was a victim of the anger and paranoia of
those who fear social change.
   Steinert was a minister of the United Church of Christ and the
Disciples of Christ denominations and served as an intern at
Riverside more than a decade ago. Since then, he worked at missions
in Paraguay and El Salvador before being assigned to Swaziland with
his wife, Terri, less than a year ago.
   Gomez, one of four Salvadorans at the service, called Steinert a
``martyr, a hero of faith, a soldier of Christ.''

<HEAD>Guenther Convicted In Shooting Death Of Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIGHTON, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first man to invoke Colorado's ``Make
My Day'' defense in a shooting, arguing he was protecting his
family, has been convicted in a separate case of murdering his
estranged wife and wounding her boyfriend.
   David Guenther, 35, sat emotionless Saturday when Adams County
District Court Judge Harlan Bockman read guilty verdicts for
first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder and first-degree
assault.
   Bockman set a May 6 sentencing date. A person convicted of
first-degree murder in Colorado must serve 40 years in prison
before becoming eligible for parole. Prosecutors said earlier they
would not seek the death penalty.
   ``It made my day,'' co-prosecutor Bruce Levin said of the
verdict, referring to the so-called ``Make My Day'' law which
allows residents to use deadly force in their homes against
intruders. It was nicknamed after a line in a Clint Eastwood film
in which a cop invites a criminal to ``make my day'' and give the
cop an excuse to shoot.
   Guenther was the first person to invoke that defense, saying he
could not be charged with the fatal shooting of a neighbor and the
wounding of two other people outside his home in 1986 because he
was protecting his family.
   Guenther was acquitted but that was overturned by the Colorado
Supreme Court. The charges were reinstated, and a jury acquitted
Guenther in the second trial last Oct. 22, but on the basis of
self-defense rather than the ``make my day'' rule.
   On March 1, 1987, Guenther shot and killed his wife, Pamela, 30,
and wounded her boyfriend, Stanley Stinson, outside a Commerce City
restaurant.
   The Guenthers' two children, Christopher, 13, and Jennifer, 11,
saw the shootings and were key prosecution witnesses along with
Stinson.
   When the trial opened Tuesday, both sides agreed there was no
question that Guenther killed his wife and wounded Stinson. At
issue was whether he acted with deliberation, as the prosecution
contended, or whether he fired eight shots in the ``heat of
passion'' when he saw his wife kissing Stinson.
   Prosecutor Tim Meinert reminded jurors of a pattern of threats
and violence by Guenther against his estranged wife, who took her
children and left him about a month before she was killed.
   Testimony showed he took his wife hostage at their home one week
before her death, releasing her unharmed after a standoff with
police that lasted several hours.
   The jury deliberated for three hours.
   Stinson said of the verdict: ``They gave this guy exactly what
he deserved. I can get a good night's sleep now. I haven't slept
for about a year.''

<HEAD>Counter-Terrorism Adviser Involved In Iran Affair Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amiram Nir, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
counterterrorism adviser involved in the Iran-Contra affair, has
resigned, the government announced Sunday.
   The government also announced the resignation of Yosef Harmelin,
head of the Shin Bet secret service for more than 11 years.
   Shamir accepted Nir's resignation two weeks ago and it will take
effect on April 1, the government announcement said.
   The government gave no reasons for the resignation. Media
reports said the reasons were political and not related to the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Nir, a former journalist, was appointed by Labor Party leader
Shimon Peres, who became prime minister after the inconclusive
elections in 1984.
   In January 1986, Nir became involved in the Iran operation and
took over from three Israeli middlemen _ Foreign Ministry director
David Kimche, businessmen Yakov Nimrodi and Al Schwimmer.
   Before Nir's involvement, the three mediated a secret 1985 arms
deal between Iran and the United States in exchange for the freedom
of U.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiite fundamentalists in
Lebanon.
   Israel then shipped 508 U.S.-made TOW anti-tank missiles and 18
Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to Iran. The United States took over
the shipments in February 1986 but continued to use Israel as a
transfer point for the arms.
   In testimony before congressional investigators last July,
former U.S. National Security Council aide Lt. Col. Oliver North
listed Nir as a main mover behind the weapons deals.
   North alleged Nir was one of the first to propose diverting
funds from the arms deals to Nicaragua's anti-government rebels,
the Contras.
   North recently pleaded innocent in federal court in Washington,
D.C. to a series of charges in connection with the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Since news of the Iranian deals broke, Israel has mantained that
it only acted in cooperation with the United States and denied any
knowledge of alleged diversion of funds to the Contras.
   Nir has been sought for questioning by special U.S. prosecutor
Lawrence E. Walsh. In exchange, Israel has insisted on an agreement
that Nir be granted immunity from prosecution.
   Shamir had planned to dismiss Nir in 1986 under a power-sharing
agreement with Peres.
   Peres, who is currently foreign minister, served as prime
minister from 1984-1986 under the accord with Shamir's right-wing
Likud Bloc. Shamir took over as prime minister in October 1986.
   News reports said that Shamir could not fire Nir in 1986 because
he feared his dismissal might be interpreted in the United States
as punishment for Nir's involvement in the weapons' deals.
   Harmelin, 65, joined Israel's secret service soon after the
Jewish state came into being in 1948.
   He held various intelligence posts before becoming chief of the
secret service in 1964.
   Harmelin was responsible for building Israel's intelligence
network in the West Bank and Gaza Strip after Israel captured these
lands from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   He left the post in 1974 to become Israel's ambassador in Iran
and South Africa. In July 1986 he was called back to the secret
service as a temporary replacement for Avraham Shalom-Ahituv, who
resigned after the so-called Shin Bet Affair.
   In the affair, Shin Bet agents were accused of fabricating
evidence to conceal their role in the beating deaths of two
Palestinians who hijacked an Israeli passenger bus in April 1984.

<TEXT>
   The Baby M surrogate motherhood case is
to draw to a close in a courtroom here Monday, but elsewhere
problems will be just beginning for two people who look and act
like Mary Beth Whitehead and William Stern.
   By coincidence, producers are to film a scene for a upcoming
two-part TV miniseries on the Baby M case in a New Jersey Turnpike
rest area at the same time the real-life litigants are to be in
court for a visitation hearing.
   The hearing was ordered by the state Supreme Court to determine
how much Mrs. Whitehead may visit Baby M, now legally known as
Melissa Stern.
   ``To some extent it's a sad coincidence,'' said Ilene Berg,
executive producer of the film, which is scheduled to be broadcast
in May on ABC. ``It's sad that this is still not resolved, that
it's never going to be perfect.''
   The producers were scheduled to film one of the early meetings
of Stern and Mrs. Whitehead, now known as Mrs. Whitehead-Gould
after her second marriage, at a rest area about 8 miles south of
the Bergen County courthouse.
   The two used to meet there before they would drive together to a
clinic in New York City where Mrs. Whitehead-Gould was inseminated
with Stern's sperm as part of a $10,000 surrogate contract.
   The scene is part of a four-hour miniseries that covers the
introduction of the Sterns and Whiteheads, the birth of Baby M, the
surrogate mother's flight to Florida with the child after she
decided she couldn't give up the baby, and the lower court custody
trial which Mrs. Whitehead-Gould lost.
   At the end of the film, an update will tell of the state Supreme
Court decision that reversed most of the lower court ruling,
granting custody of the baby to Stern but restoring Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould's parental rights.
   The highway rest area scene is the last to be filmed. The rest
of the movie was shot in a Van Nuys, Calif., soundstage where
producers built a replica of the Bergen County courtroom where the
Baby M case was played out.
   Ms. Berg said the coincidence of the New Jersey filming on the
same day as the visitation hearing was a bit of good fortune for
the miniseries.
   ``It shows, if anything, that our movie is still very timely,''
she said.
   Since neither side in the Baby M dispute agreed to take part in
the movie, producers wrote the script from court documents and news
reports. They said they tried to take no sides in the battle,
letting the facts speak for themselves.
   ``I expect people will be arguing about this after it (the
movie) is over,'' said producer Gordon Freedman.
   Actress Jo Beth Williams, seen in ``The Big Chill'' and ``The
Day After,'' plays Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, while actor John Shea
plays Stern and soap opera actress Robin Strasser plays Stern's
wife, Elizabeth.
   Hill Street Blues' Bruce Weitz plays the surrogate mother's
first husband, Richard Whitehead; actress Anne Jackson plays Baby
M's legal guardian, Lorraine Abraham; and Dabney Coleman of ``The
Slap Maxwell Story'' plays the Sterns' attorney, Gary Skoloff.
   Ms. Williams said she studied for the part by reading court
documents and newspaper clippings, and watching television news
reports.
   In playing Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, the actress said, she found
that the surrogate mother was neither a victim nor a heroine.
   ``It's difficult to put a single label on her,'' Ms. Williams
said. ``She's a woman who was put in a very difficult situation.
Some of what Mary Beth did was impulsive. But it was out of
desperation.
   ``I feel very strongly for both sides of this story. They both
have been through tremendous pain.''

   Four consecutive days of
torrential rain left at least 18 people dead and forced the
evacuation of 55,000 residents of the Buenos Aires-La Plata area,
officials said Sunday.
   The latest victim was a 4-year-old boy from Villa Soldati who
was swept away by floodwaters Sunday, authorities said. Weather
forecasters said the heavy rains that have pounded Buenos Aires and
central Argentina since Thursday would continue Monday.
   Families have been forced to flee to the roofs of their homes to
escape floodwaters in some low-lying areas. Firefighters and police
have used boats, makeshift rafts and horses to help evacuate
families to temporary shelters in schools, sports clubs and office
buildings.
   The dead included seven children who drowned and two women
electrocuted while crossing flooded streets where live cables had
fallen.

   Anti-apartheid clergyman Allan
Boesak said Sunday that if he is killed, the government and police
should come under suspicion.
   ``Over the last week there have been more death threats,'' said
Boesak, leader of the mixed-race branch of the Dutch Reformed
Church and president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.
   ``I want the world to know the light of suspicion should fall on
the South African government and the police if something like that
should happen,'' he said at a news conference.
   ``One doesn't say these things to create an atmosphere of
martyrdom. It has happened before in this country. People have died
mysteriously.''
   Capt. J.L. Barnard, a spokesman for national police headquarters
in Pretoria, said Boesak had made ``a totally unfair, untrue and
malicious statement.''
   ``It is another example of how untested, unsubstantiated,
one-sided allegations are made in public in a bid to discredit the
South African Police as well as the South African government,'' he
said.
   Boesak said volunteer student guards had seen a police car drive
by his home early Tuesday. A passenger in the back seat pointed a
gun out the window, but the guards shined lights and the car sped
away, he said.
   ``This is a very sinister development,'' Boesak said. He said
police later denied dispatching a car to the area.
   Barnard said he could not comment on the facts of Boesak's
allegations about the car.
   Boesak and other South African church leaders have vowed to take
a more confrontational approach since the government banned the 17
leading anti-apartheid groups last month. Among the protesting
clergymen are Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize; and the Rev. Frank Chikane, head of the South
African Council of Churches.
   Authorities arrested 25 of the church leaders Feb. 29 when they
tried to march to Parliament with a petition protesting the bans.
The government also banned a new Committee for the Defense of
Democracy set up to take over activities of the outlawed
organizations.
   Boesak on Sunday lamented statements by the white branch of the
country's Dutch Reformed Church saying he and Tutu don't represent
the church.
   ``The white Dutch Reformed Church is saying to the state, `These
people are not the church and do not represent the church;
therefore, when you act against them, you are not acting against
the church,''' said Boesak. ``Once you create that kind of
atmosphere, almost everybody out there who is angry with us could
feel justified in threatening our lives because the church said
they were not acting against people of God.''
   Boesak's news conference was attended by a delegation from the
World Alliance. It had come to express solidarity with South
African clergymen who are challenging the government and its
apartheid segregation policies.
   Leaders of the alliance, based in Geneva, said they represent
164 churches with a worldwide membership of 70 million. Sunday's
Cape Town delegation included a Swiss minister, Edmond Perret,
general secretary of the aliance; and Joachim Guhrt, president of
the Reformed Churches of West Germany.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>At Least Six Suspected Soviet Spies Reportedly Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police raids that began last week have
netted at least six people suspected of spying in this country for
the Soviet KGB, a leading newspaper said Sunday.
   The Bonn-based newspaper Die Welt, quoting unidentified security
sources, said the suspects include Russian emigres placed in West
Germany by the Soviet intelligence and secret police agency.
   Die Welt said one suspect was arrested in Switzerland and that
the others were nabbed by West German federal police.
   Authorities have not confirmed the report. It was to appear in
Die Welt's Monday editions and was telexed in advance to other news
organizations.
   Other West German newspapers reported Sunday that eight to 15
suspected spies had been caught in raids that began Thursday.
   Federal officials have refused to release details on the
operation until it is over. Gerhard Boeden, president of the
watchdog federal agency known as the Ministry for the Protection of
the Constitution, was quoted in the mass-publication Bild am
Sonntag Sunday newspaper as saying the investigation was open.
   He also said communist espionage has increased since relations
between the Kremlin and Western countries have thawed.
   ``In times when political tensions are relaxed, Eastern
intelligence agencies ... become much more active,'' Boeden said in
a Sunday radio interview.
   He said most of the communist agents working in West Germany
have been sent by East Germany.
   Newspapers, quoting security sources, said the suspects include
government employees with access to key information. Among reported
suspects were an engineer with access to top-secret plans for the
NATO defense alliance's Jaeger jet fighter.

<HEAD>Governor Says His Loan Of Money Kept Others From Getting It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Evan Mecham, attempting to convince
the Arizona Senate that his $80,000 loan from a protocol fund was
on the up-and-up, suggests that if he hadn't borrowed the money
others might have spent it.
   ``You know, money is like honey,'' Mecham said during his
impeachment trial. ``Honey attracts bees and money attracts people.
   ``People heard there was money, and they came in with ideas to
spend it. `Can we do this with it? Can we do that with it?'''
   He said during his testimony last week he had the best idea for
the funds that had been raised by his inaugural committee to pay
off campaign debts. When a state law blocked use of the money for
that purpose, Mecham said he proposed the protocol fund.
   Other governors had such funds, he said, and the purpose was to
make sure the governor ``wouldn't have to go into the hole'' for
incidental expenses.
   For instance, he said, the fund could pay for his wife,
Florence, to accompany him to official events out of town.
   ``It was my understanding this was to keep me from having to
spend my own personal money for things for my office,'' said the
governor.
   He conceded there were items for which he knew he couldn't use
the fund: politics and living expenses. But he said he never
suspected that loaning the money to his own car dealership was
forbidden. And he never considered the fund public property.
   ``I never heard the words discussed, `public funds,''' said the
first-term Republican governor, the first U.S. governor to face an
impeachment trial in six decades.
   In the second of three impeachment charges, Mecham is accused of
misusing state funds by borrowing the $80,000. Earlier in the
trial, senators heard evidence on a charge that he tried to halt an
investigation of an alleged death threat by a member of his staff.
   On both charges, the governor's basic defense is ignorance of
the facts. On the first count, he contends he was never fully
informed of details of the alleged threat and had no idea a crime
might have been committed. On the second count, he argues he was
never told the fund had become public money and wasn't aware that
borrowing the $80,000 might violate conditions of a legal agreement
for its use.
   He said he received instructions about the money from William
Long, his inaugural chairman, who signed an agreement with the
Maricopa County attorney's office to avoid a lawsuit over use of
the proceeds from Mecham's inaugural ball.
   ``Mr. Long said, `We have gone through all of this rigamarole
and you can spend it for any damned thing that you want, except you
can't spend it for politics or living expenses,''' Mecham testified.
   Long is ill and has not testified. He submitted an affidavit
that seemed to support Mecham's position.
   ``At no time was Governor Mecham informed that these monies were
a gift to the state of Arizona or a gift to anyone other than Evan
Mecham ... to be used for the lawful purposes which had been agreed
upon,'' Long said.
   With the trial entering its fifth week, the Senate has yet to
take up the charge considered most critical, the allegation that he
concealed a $350,000 campaign loan from developer Barry Wolfson. It
is the only one of the three counts which also is the basis of a
criminal felony case set for trial April 21.
   Meanwhile, the governor continues to campaign for re-election in
a recall election scheduled for May 17. A poll released Sunday
showed that Mecham would still be one of the front runners if the
election were held now, but 54 percent of voters said Mecham would
be ``unacceptable'' as governor. The poll was commissioned by the
Arizona Republic and KPNX-TV.

   Jesse Jackson's victory in Michigan forces the
Democratic Party to take a more serious look at his presidential
bid and increases his chances of winning in the high-stakes New
York primary, political analysts said Sunday.
   Jackson defeated front-runner Michael Dukakis by almost 2-1 in
Michigan's primary-like caucuses Saturday, infusing new momentum
into an already strong campaign that is within striking distance of
first place in the national delegate count.
   ``There are still some in the political establishment who think
1988 is an inevitable replay of 1984,'' said Ann Lewis, a
Democratic strategist and an informal adviser to Jackson's
campaign. ``The day after Michigan a new world has dawned.''
   With returns from 94 percent of the voting sites in Michigan,
Jackson had 107,689 or 55 percent to 55,337 or 28 percent for
Dukakis. Jackson won enormous majorities in Detroit. In the 1st
Congressional District, for example, Jackson beat Dukakis 25,416 to
1,809. In the 13th, the margin was 17,725 to 1,539.
   Jackson, treated as a fringe candidate in 1984, has won in eight
states, Michigan, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Virginia, South Carolina, Alaska, and Puerto Rico's non-binding
contest. The victories are forcing the party to re-examine the
theory that a black cannot be nominated for president in 1988.
   ``Jesse is running to win the nomination,'' Ms. Lewis said.
``What does the Democratic Party give him? The morning after
Michigan he earns the right, it's not what we give him.''
   Paul Maslin, pollster for Illinois Sen. Paul Simon's campaign,
said Jackson's Michigan victory and possible wins in Wisconsin and
New York could give him the most national delegates.
   ``A real extraordinary endgame is presenting itself to the
Democratic Party ... they have to be seriously thinking about the
prospect of a Jackson nomination,'' Maslin said.
   Jackson's win also puts greater pressure on Dukakis, who has
failed to win in major contests in Illinois and Michigan, and faces
a serious challenge in New York, which has 255 delegates at stake
in its April 19th primary.
   ``New York is going to be a major test,'' Ms. Lewis said.
``Michigan greatly raises the stakes in New York.''
   ``The stakes could not be more critical,'' said Maslin. ``He
(Dukakis) can't just finish second to Jesse Jackson. He can't say
I'm the leading white candidate. It's not going to work this year.''
   A New York Daily News poll published Sunday shows Dukakis
favored by 45 percent of the 528 Democrats surveyed to 29 percent
for Jackson. The poll, conducted between Monday, March 21 and
Thursday, March 24, had a margin for error of plus or minus 4.5
percentage points.
   However, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo has said that if two or three
candidates are left in the Democratic race prior to the primary,
Jackson has a chance of winning.
   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt was expected to drop out of the
race to run for re-election to his congressional seat.
   In addition, a Marist College Institute for Public Opinion Poll
found that 57 percent of 459 Democratic voters surveyed earlier
this month gave Jackson a favorable rating, to 30 percent
unfavorable. The same survey, conducted in January, gave Jackson a
44 percent favorable rating to 41 percent unfavorable.
   ``New York is a fairly volatile state,'' said David Garth, a
media consultant who is working for Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore
Jr.'s campaign. ``There is a strong potential Jewish vote.''
   In the Marist College survey, 36 percent of the Jewish voters
gave Jackson a favorable rating, an increase from 17 percent in
January. Forty-three percent gave Jackson an unfavorable rating to
62 percent in January. The poll has a margin of error of 5 percent.
   Garth said Jackson can win in New York because ``Dukakis has
proven he can't stop him.'' But the consultant said the party has
become more conservative in recent years.
   ``New Yorkers have generally moved from the left to much more
moderate Democrats. They got to have somebody to win the
election,'' he said. ``It used to be the NDC (National Democratic
Committee) was `Novemeber Doesn't Count.' The old New York is not
the same. It's a wide-open race.''

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad
announced a new 32-member Cabinet Sunday, replacing Prime Minister
Mizanur Rahman Choudhury but retaining other aides in important
positions.
   Named to succeed Choudhury was Deputy Prime Minister Maudud
Ahmed, a British-trained lawyer, who also will have the Industries
Ministry. Political observers said Choudhury may become speaker of
the 300-member Parliament.
   Foreign Minister Humayun Rasheed Choudhury and Finance Minister
Maj. Gen. Abdul Munem will remain in their posts in the Cabinet,
known as the Council of Ministers.
   Cabinet changes had been expected after Ershad's Jatiya Party
won the March 3 elections that were boycotted by the major
opposition groups. Jatiya won 251 seats in Parliament.
   Kazi Jafar Ahmed, a political advisor to the president, was
promoted to deputy prime minister replacing Maudud Ahmed. The two
other deputy prime ministers are Shah Moazem Hussain, who also
heads the rural development and local government ministries, and
Abdul Matin who is in charge of the Home Ministry.
   Political analysts said no major shifts were expected in
Ershad's policies of non-alignment and a free-market economy.
   Alliances headed by two major opposition leaders, Sheik Hasina
and Khalida Zia, have organized scores of demonstrations since Nov.
10, demanding that Ershad resign.
   Ershad, a 58-year-old former army general, declared a state of
emergency on Dec. 6 to curb the anti-government protests. He seized
power in a coup in March 1982, asssumed the presidency in 1983 and
was elected president in 1986.

   Residents of a neighborhood here say
they are afraid to park on the streets after an arsonist torched as
many as seven cars last week.
   ``This whole world is going kaput,'' said one resident,
Josephine Piotrowski.
   The arsonist burned five cars and is believed to be responsible
for at least two other car fires since March 23, said David
Kessinger, the city's deputy fire marshal. All of the fires
occurred in the same north city neighborhood, he said, but who
started them and why are unknown.
   ``He finds a car that's unlocked _ bam,'' Kessinger said.
   Larry Graves said he woke up about 1:30 a.m. Saturday as
firefighters were putting out the flames that destroyed his
two-door 1965 Mercedes-Benz.
   ``You go to bed, your car's sitting there fine. Then you get
woken up and your car's a lump of nothing,'' he said.

   Egypt on Sunday welcomed the scheduled
return to the Middle East of Secretary of State George P. Shultz,
who will be trying to gain support for a U.S. plan aimed at
settling the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid told reporters Egypt hopes
Shultz's visit will ``add momentum to the peace process and to the
search for a lasting, just peace.''
   Shultz is scheduled to arrive in Jerusalem on April 3 for talks
with Israeli leaders and then go to Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Saudi
Arabia before returning to Washington April 8.
   He was on a shuttle tour of the region earlier this month and
presented the leaders of Israel, Syria, Jordan and Egypt with the
U.S. proposal.
   Egypt is the only Arab nation that has diplomatic relations with
Israel.
   Syria and Israel have expressed strong reservations about the
American plan. Jordan has not given a definite reply.
   The plan calls for an international conference as early as May 1
to launch talks on a type of self-rule for the 1.5 million
Palestinians living in the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan
River and Gaza Strip.
   Negotiations on the final status of the occupied territories
would start next December.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is opposed to an
international conference, which would include the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council _ America, the Soviet Union,
China, Britain and France. Shamir has said such a conference could
attempt to force Israel to make concessions that would jeopardize
the nation's security.

   If ever a campaign day forecast the vote, it was
Friday in Michigan.
   Jesse Jackson drew thunderous crowds from East Detroit to Flint
and Saginaw, while Michael Dukakis ended a muddled day on the road
before a small audience at a Polish-American hall in Hamtramck.
   Crowds waited patiently for Jackson to appear, but in Comstock
Park, the grumbling was evident when Dukakis arrived about half an
hour late due to logistical problems that wiped out many of his
planned events.
   ``Make them wait _ we did,'' yelled one older man as Dukakis cut
short his town meeting in the Grand Rapids suburb to hold a news
conference and rush to a fund-raiser.
   ``Speak English _ this is America,'' said another as Dukakis
spoke in Greek and Spanish with those in the UAW hall who addressed
him in those languages.
   On Saturday, the fervor of Jackson's backers became a tidal wave
of votes that gave the civil rights leader his biggest victory yet,
defeating Dukakis by almost 2-1.
   Campaign events are an extraordinarily unreliable guide to
election results. Jackson drew big crowds in 1984 and still
finished third in the Democratic presidential race that year.
   But the rallies and town meetings and handshaking tours can be a
window into the reality of the campaign and into how the voters are
reacting.
   In Michigan, the view through that window was accurate.
   Jackson worked this industrial state hard, even delaying his
departure from the state on Saturday to travel by motorcade and on
foot through mostly black neighborhoods, encouraging his supporters
to turn out.
   Dukakis, in contrast, spent relatively little time in the state.
He flew in Monday night for a quick visit, held a pair of news
conferences Wednesday night and then struggled through the day
Friday.
   Part of the difference in schedules came from Dukakis'
commitment to return to Boston to work as governor, part from
Dukakis' greater attention to fund-raising and part from campaign
judgments about allocating candidate's time among the various
states.
   And when Dukakis was in the state, he found himself explaining
over and over again that he had not flip-flopped on the trade
issue, that his backing for a trade bill by Sen. Don Riegle of
Michigan was not just a political ploy. Rep. Richard Gephardt
grabbed the front pages by pounding away at Dukakis on trade. It
didn't help Gephardt _ he finished a dismal third _ but the blows
kept Dukakis on the defensive.
   Jackson steadfastly refused to be drawn into a Democratic trade
war, sticking to flowery, positive phrases about expanding exports
and knocking down walls.
   The messages from the two candidates were also substantively
different. Dukakis talked of competence and compassion, as his
televisions ads mentioned balancing budgets and creating jobs.
   Jackson hit over and over again at his theme of hope for those
who are down, who are jobless, who are out of luck.
   In a state where the auto industry has put thousands out of
work, Jackson's more optimistic message was the stronger one _ as
Dukakis came close to admitting Saturday night in defeat.
   ``The people of Michigan have been through a very difficult
time, There is great unhappiness, great concern, great uncertainty.
There are laid-off workers. Workers today who have jobs are worried
they are going to be next,'' Dukakis said. ``Jesse has strong
feelings about that _ as I do.''
   Dukakis relied on an impressive organization in Michigan, as he
has in other states, plus endorsements from Detroit Mayor Coleman
Young and Riegle.
   Dukakis congratulated Jackson for his win, but the victor took
something of a swipe at Dukakis.
   ``It was the message of the soul and authenticity of Jesse
Jackson versus money and technology _ and the people prevailed,''
Jackson told about 40 supporters Sunday at Westchester County
Airport in New York.
   ``Everybody won something in Detroit _ Dukakis won Mayor Young's
endorsement. I won the people's votes,'' Jackson said late Saturday
night.
   Two stories from the campaign trail highlighted the differences
in Michigan.
   At Dukakis' final event in Hamtramack, his staff was desperately
trying to round up people to fill the half-empty hall as the
governor was about to arrive. When Dukakis did finally show up, the
hall had filled up a bit more, but news people and plainclothes
policemen made up at least a quarter of the audience.
   That same day, when Jackson was holding a rally at a union hall
in Detroit, two plainclothes policeman stopped their car about a
block from the event to ask a reporter what was going on.
   Told Jackson was speaking at the hall, the policemen parked _
and went in to listen to the candidate speak.

   Watches for snow and gusty wind were posted into Monday over the
mountains, foothills and southwestern section of Colorado as well
as across southeastern Wyoming.
   Elsewhere, rain was scattered from northern Maine into eastern
New York state and northern New Jersey, and snow was scattered from
western New York state across western Pennsylvania.
   Temperatures over the west-central Plains were unseasonably warm
and records were set at Denver at 77 degrees; Goodland, Kan., at
82; and Valentine, Neb., at 83. Colorado Springs, Colo., tied its
record of 72.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 23
degrees at West Yellowstone, Mont., to 96 at Palm Springs, Calif.
The low for the day was 12 degrees at International Falls, Minn.
   For Monday, snow was forecast over the northern and central
Rockies, changing to rain across the northern Plains, the upper
Mississippi Valley and Wisconsin. Rain and occasional
thundershowers were forecast from the central Plains across the
central Missouri Valley.
   High in the 30s and 40s were predicted from much of New England
across the Great Lakes, northern Minnesota, North Dakota, western
South Dakota, the west-central Plains, the Rockies, and into Utah
and Nevada; in the 50s and 60s from southern New England across the
central Atlantic states, the Ohio Valley, the remainder of the
upper half of the Mississippi Valley, the remainder of the northern
Plains, and along the northern two-thirds of the Pacific Coast; in

   The Assemblies of God hopes to lay the
Jimmy Swaggart scandal to rest after the church's highest governing
body meets Monday to discipline the television minister for an
alleged relationship with a prostitute.
   The Pentecostal denomination's 250-member General Presbytery is
charged with resolving the conflict between the Executive
Presbytery, the church's 13-member national board of directors, and
church officials in Louisiana who have proposed what some say is
too lenient a punishment for Swaggart.
   Swaggart, the denomination's most prominent minister, confessed
Feb. 21 from his Baton Rouge, La., pulpit to unspecified sins.
Swaggart did not elaborate publicly, but reports have linked him to
voyeurism involving a prostitute.
   Swaggart, who addressed his congregation briefly in Baton Rouge
on Sunday, as he has done several times since formally
relinquishing the pulpit, is not expected to appear at Monday's
meeting, said church spokeswoman Juleen Turnage.
   In response to reporters' shouted questions as he drove from the
service, Swaggart said he wasn't planning to leave the ministry,
adding, ``Why should I?''
   The Assemblies' Louisiana Presbytery recommended a two-year
rehabilitation and a three-month suspension from the pulpit for
Swaggart. Mrs. Turnage has said that all other Assemblies ministers
who have confessed to moral failure were barred from preaching for
at least a year.
   The Executive Presbytery discussed the matter for 11 hours Feb.
25 and 26 before asking Louisiana officials to reconsider. The
Executive Presbytery, headed by General Superintendent G. Raymond
Carlson, apparently wanted tougher penalties for Swaggart.
   But after gathering again Feb. 29 for what was described as an
emotional nine-hour session, the Louisiana Presbytery stood by its
original decision.
   The Louisiana Presbytery has close ties to Swaggart _ for
instance, state superintendent Cecil Janway also sits on the board
of Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries.
   Reports were circulating that Swaggart would leave the
denomination if church officials suspended him for longer than
three months, but a spokesman for Swaggart's ministry said the
preacher has made no decision on how he might react. Mrs. Turnage
said she did not believe the General Presbytery would be swayed by
``rumors heard through the media.''
   Mrs. Turnage said the church's national officials have the final
say, but until now have always been able to work out an agreement
with state leaders.
   The General Presbytery, whose members include representatives
from each of the church's state councils, is a court of last resort
on ministerial credentials. Generally, a minister would appeal his
case to the group after his course of rehabilitation had been
decided by the Executive Presbytery. The Executive Presbytery
short-circuited that process when it decided March 3 to turn the
Swaggart case over to the larger body.
   The two-day meeting at the denomination's headquarters is to
open at 2 p.m. Monday. The group will debate according to
parliamentary rules of order and a majority vote will decide
Swaggart's fate, Mrs. Turnage said. She expected a decision to be
made late Tuesday afternoon.
   Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries, with television broadcasts that
reach several foreign countries, took in an estimated $150 million
in 1986. The group contributes $12 million a year to the foreign
missions program of the national church.
   Donations have fallen off since Swaggart's confession, forcing
his ministry to lay off about 100 workers and suspend construction
at the Jimmy Swaggart Bible College.
   But Swaggart, who addressed his congregation last week, seems
undaunted and apparently is counting on the General Presbytery to
follow the Louisiana district's recommendation of a three-month
suspension.
   Swaggart told his congregation Wednesday that he was going out
of his mind but ``when I'm back in the pulpit on May 22, I'll be
back in my mind.''
   May 22 would be three months from the start of Swaggart's
voluntary abstention from preaching.
   On Sunday, Swaggart introduced a speaker and led some hymns.
Later, as he drove away with his wife and son, he said in response
to a reporter's question that there was no reason for him to leave
the Assemblies of God.
   But he declined to answer further questions, responding to a
male reporter who asked him to ``come over here and talk to us'' by
shouting back, ``You're not pretty enough!''

<HEAD>Daily News Poll Indicates Bush, Dukakis New York Front-Runners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the New York primary less than a month
away, a poll published Sunday suggested Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis and Vice President George Bush were the clear favorites
among Democratic and Republican voters across the state.
   The Daily News poll had Dukakis favored by 45 percent of the
Democrats surveyed. His closest rival was Jesse Jackson, preferred
by 29 percent of the Democrats.
   None of the three other active Democratic candidates was favored
by more than 6 percent of the voters who participated in the
survey. Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt was favored by 6 percent,
Illinois Sen. Paul Simon by 5 percent and Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore by 5 percent.
   On the Republican side, voters surveyed favored Bush by 68
percent, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole by 23 percent and former television
evangelist Pat Roberson by 4 percent.
   Although Dukakis was strongly favored by the Democrats polled,
it is still clear that New York Democrats would like to see Gov.
Mario Cuomo in the race for the nomination.
   When those surveyed were asked about a presidential race that
included Cuomo, the support for Dukakis sharply diminished. Cuomo
was favored by 59 percent and Dukakis dropped to third place in the
standing with 13 percent. Jackson was still in second place among
New York Democrats, but his support dropped to 16 percent.
   The poll was conducted for the Daily News by Chilton Research
Services of Radnor, Pa. It surveyed 528 Democrats and 496
Republicans who said they intended to vote in the primary. The poll
was conducted between Monday, March 21 and Thursday, March 24 and
has a margin for error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.
   The New York primary is April 19.

   Vice President George Bush and
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis have made dramatic gains in
recent weeks in Utah, a poll suggests.
   The change came after both Bush and Dukakis had wins to point to
on Super Tuesday, March 8, which featured a big round of primaries
and caucuses.
   Dukakis leads Rep. Richard Gephardt 32 percent to 8 percent and
Bush leads Bob Dole 47 percent to 29 percent, according to a survey
by pollster Dan Jones & Associates, which conducting the poll taken
March 18 for the Deseret News and KSL-TV.
   An earlier poll by the same organization, on February 24-25,
found that Dole was favored over Bush, 39 percent to 32 percent. On
the Democratic side, Gephardt was behind Dukakis, but by a much
smaller margin, 30 percent to 20 percent.
   The polls of 605 Utahs have an error margin of plus or minus 4
percentage points.

   Jesse Jackson parlayed his built-in core of
support _ the potent black voice of the Michigan Democratic Party _
into a landslide victory in the state's Democratic caucuses.
   Jackson galvanized the black community, which responded with a
highly organized get-out-the-vote effort for Saturday's caucuses.
   But Jackson's commanding 55 percent of the vote far outstripped
the state's black population. According to 1980 census, Michigan is
13 percent black.
   Jackson himself, campaigning in Connecticut on Sunday,
downplayed the racial breakdown of the balloting, saying his first
concern was to ``count the votes, not the color.''
   ``It's a campaign of growth, a campaign of hope,'' he said.
   ``I think the major factor was the level of intensity of Jackson
supporters and the lack of intensity of other supporters,''
Michigan House Speaker Gary Owen said Sunday.
   Owen, who supports Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., said early
Sunday that he'd gone out campaigning several days and found ``an
overwhelming lack of enthusiasm'' for all of the candidates except
Jackson.
   ``I know there was excitement in seeing a presidential candidate
and hearing a presidential candidate, but I never felt that degree
of intensity among the crowds for those other candidates,'' he said.
   Zolton Ferency, a former state Democratic Party chairman, said
organized labor leaders liked Rep. Richard Gephardt's tough trade
stand, but ``his campaign was dying. They didn't want to back a
loser.''
   Michael Dukakis, on the other hand, wasn't well-known in
Michigan and had to introduce himself to the state's Democrats then
try to get them to go out an vote for him, Ferency said.
   Dukakis, he added, wasn't ``the kind of candidate that can
generate instant enthusiasm.''
   Jackson buried Dukakis in vote totals with 107,689 votes or 55
percent to Dukakis' 55,337 or 28 percent, while Gephardt came in
third with 24,995 or 13 percent. Sen. Paul Simon had 4,069 or 2
percent; Gore had 3,818 or 2 percent.
   Those totals represented 94 percent of the vote counted. The
state Democratic Party said it wouldn't have full figures until
Monday.
   The delegate projections from those results showed Jackson
getting 74 of the state's 138 committed delegates, while Dukakis
would get 50, Gephardt 11, and uncommitted 3.
   Another 12 delegates are Michigan members of the Democratic
National Committee who go to the national convention not pledged to
any particular candidate.
   Jackson particularly swamped Dukakis in the predominantly black
1st and 13th congressional districts, which cover Detroit. In the
1st, Jackson had 25,416 compared with 1,809 for Dukakis, while in
the 13th he had 17,725 to Dukakis's 1,539.
   State Rep. Alma Stallworth, a Democrat from Detroit, said those
figures represent ``a lot of young people and new voters who got
involved for the first time.''
   Stallworth said the highly organized Jackson campaign also got a
boost from black churches, which urged people to vote.
   But Jackson also did well in mostly white districts covering the
western, southern and eastern Lower Peninsula.
   ``He was saying what people wanted to hear,'' said state Sen.
David Holmes, D-Detroit. ``It all boils down to bread-and-butter
issues regardless of race, color or creed. He outworked, outtalked
and outcampaigned the other candidates in all 18 congressional
districts.''
   Organized labor, which carries great weight in blue-collar
Michigan, didn't make any endorsements, unlike 1984 when it was
solidly behind Walter Mondale.
   Stallworth said although labor took no formal action, some union
members worked for the Jackson campaign.

   A judge's unusual decision removing Attorney
General Edwin Meese III from investigating an FBI agent's
harassment charges adds to a string of cases involving potential
conflicts of interest by the nation's highest law enforcement
officer.
   In some cases, Meese has disqualified himself, leading
congressional critics to suggest he is not in command at the
Justice Department. Meese's aides say there haven't been enough
cases to have an effect.
   In other cases, Meese's failure to remove himself has brought
him legal difficulties as well as criticism from political foes
that he is insensitive to the high ethical standards to which an
attorney general should conform.
   Chicago federal Judge John F. Grady disqualified Meese from the
criminal civil rights investigation involving black FBI agent
Donald Rochon.
   Grady said Meese and Assistant Attorney General William Bradford
Reynolds would not be able to remain impartial in a federal grand
jury investigation because they are defendants in a civil suit
brought by Rochon last November.
   Rochon says he was the victim of death threats from white
colleagues in the Chicago FBI office and that Justice Department
and FBI officials engaged in a cover-up of his complaints.
   The judge called for a ``Chinese wall'' between Justice
Department attorneys conducting the criminal investigation and
Meese and Reynolds, who heads the department's civil rights
division.
   In one instance where the question of conflict has arisen, Meese
decided not to request appointment of an independent counsel to
investigate two former Justice Department officials involved in an
Environmental Protection Agency controversy. His decision overruled
department subordinates. Meese had earlier attended a White House
meeting where aspects of the EPA controversy were discussed.
   His behavior casts ``a pall of favoritism'' on the office of
attorney general, declared Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.
   ``This is absolute nonsense,'' responded Terry Eastland, a
Justice Department spokesman. ``The attorney general has made a
diligent effort to recuse himself from matters in which there might
be a conflict and he has kept himself in cases where he doesn't
have a relationship that would give rise to questions.''
   When Meese came under criminal investigation last May 11 in the
Wedtech scandal, he hired private Washington legal counsel who
represent other clients in criminal investigations and prosecutions
before the Justice Department.
   Under a process put in place because of the criminal probe of
Meese, his Washington lawyers regularly provide client lists to the
Justice Department.
   ``We advise Justice and they advise his office so that the
matters are screened,'' said Meese lawyer Nathan Lewin.
   Lewin said that ``there may be a couple of dozen'' cases
involved. Meese has removed himself from these matters, even though
only ``rarely do our criminal cases merit the attention of the
attorney general,'' said Lewin.
   On that basis, Meese is excluded from the espionage case against
an Israeli Air Force officer _ Brig. Gen. Aviem Sella _ who
recruited Navy counterterrorism analyst Jonathan Pollard as a spy.
Lewin represents Sella.
   Also on that basis, Meese was recused from the bid-rigging and
kickback probe of the International Telecommunications Satellite
Organization, Intelsat.
   In his previous job as White House counselor, Meese helped round
up political support from the Teamsters and the union's president
Jackie Presser.
   Because of the potential conflict, Meese has removed himself
from any role in proposed Justice Department efforts to place the
Teamsters union under trusteeship. He also disqualified himself
from reviewing the criminal investigation of Presser, who was
indicted in 1986.
   Meese disqualified himself last year when the Reagan
administration opposed renewing the federal law which created
independent counsels to investigate top government officials. The
criminal investigation of Meese is being conducted by one of those
counsels.
   Meese has been criticized for continuing to involve himself in
other matters that might represent conflicts.
   For example, Meese first gave grand jury testimony in the
scandal surrounding Wedtech Corp., the Bronx, N.Y., defense
contractor, in March of last year. Despite his grand jury
appearance, Meese didn't recuse himself from the Wedtech
investigation being conducted by U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani in
Manhattan until the second week in April.
   In his March grand jury testimony, Meese was appearing only as a
witness and he said that he quickly removed himself in April when
he was told that his financial adviser, W. Franklyn Chinn, and a
longtime friend, E. Robert Wallach, were under investigation by
Giuliani. Both were indicted last December for allegedly extracting
payments from Wedtech in an attempt to influence Meese and other
public officials to assist Wedtech.
   The timing of Meese's recusal from the Wedtech case was of
concern to independent counsel James McKay, who investigated
whether Meese may have passed along sensitive law enforcement
information about Giuliani's probe to Wallach, sources familiar
with the McKay probe have said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Meese also owned $14,000 in stock in the regional Bell telephone
companies at a time when he met at the Justice Department with
executives of four of the companies in 1985 and 1986. The
executives sought _ and ultimately succeeded in getting _ a
reversal in the Justice Department's position on whether the Baby
Bells ought to be allowed to expand into several new types of
business. The department now favors expansion into several new
areas.
   McKay's office has been examining Meese's Baby Bell stock
holdings to determine whether he may have violated federal
conflict-of-interest laws.
   On another matter, Meese attended a dinner party in Switzerland
paid for out of a fund maintained by Ambassador Faith Whittlesey.
Later, Meese turned down appointment of an independent counsel to
investigate alleged misuse of the fund and obstruction of justice
by Whittlesey.

   A fire apparently started by a kerosene
heater spread through four row houses early Sunday, killing five
people and forcing 17 others to flee, authorities said.
   The two-alarm blaze started on the first floor of the house in
which the people died and extended to three other houses before it
was declared under control about 1:15 a.m., just under an hour
after it was reported, said Charles Maier, supervisor of fire
communications.
   All four houses were extensively damaged, he said.
   ``Oh, Lord, there were terrible flames,'' said Evelyn Carson,
who lives across the street from the homes.
   Maier identified the victims as Raymond Smith Jr., 37; Erma
Hilton, 35; 2{-year-old twin sisters Elishvia and Efrona Jefferson;
and Freda Garland, 1{. The two adults were sister and brother; the
twins were the woman's great-nieces and the youngest child was the
woman's daughter, relatives said.
   Virginia Coverson, a neighbor, said the Smith family had lived
on the block for years and Raymond Jr. was an invalid. ``I think he
crawled to the door, but he couldn't get out,'' she said.
   Evelyn Smith, the mother of Smith and Ms. Hilton, escaped the
fire.
   The American Red Cross opened a temporary shelter at a nearby
recreation center for the five families who were evacuated,
spokeswoman Susan Snyder said.

<TEXT>
   Helicopters carrying tired,
dirt-smeared U.S. soldiers swarmed back to this military base
Sunday and the troopers prepared to return home.
   ``We accomplished what we came here to do _ put the Nicaraguans
back in their place,'' Sgt. Matthew West said as he climbed out of
a helicopter at the end of a flight from training exercises in
Juticalpa, about 40 miles from the Honduran-Nicaraguan border.
   ``Now we just want to get clean,'' said West, 21, from Dallas.
   Soldiers from the 82nd Airbrone Division based at Fort Bragg,
N.C., are expected to begin returning to the United States at about
5 p.m. EST Monday. They will be the first to arrive home after an
11-day training exercise meant as a show of U.S. military strength
in the Central America region.
   Units of the 7th Light Infantry Division headquartered at Fort
Ord., Calif., also were flown here in the show of force.
   President Reagan sent the 3,200 soldiers to Honduras on March
17-18 after Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo asked for help.
Azcona said an estimated 2,000 Nicaraguan troopers had entered
Honduran territory in the Bocay region.
   Honduran military officials said the invading Sandinistas were
after a major supply depot the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels
maintained just inside Honduras.
   American soldiers said their mission was a success.
   ``Our presence here definitely made a difference,'' said Sgt.
Dale Taylor, 22, of Red Springs, N.C. ``It proves how serious we
are about what we are doing and that we can get here in 18 hours if
the need arises.''
   The Reagan administration called the military action a training
exercise, but it also was meant as a warning to the Sandinistas
against further action inside Honduran territory.
   And despite a few tense days during which the Honduran air force
twice bombed Sandinista positions in the Bocay region of western
Olancho province, the U.S. soldiers were involved only in training
maneuvers.
   The Sandinistas, while claiming their soldiers had never entered
Honduran territory, withdrew their troops from the area about two
days after the American troops arrived.
   Taylor said he is one of the ``lucky ones'' who will be among
the first to parachute into a training field at Ft. Bragg Monday.
   ``It's going to be a sis-boom-bah occasion. They're going to
have a band and our families will be there. It's great to be going
home,'' he said.
   Pfc. Edward Broker, 27, of Denver, said he is going to ``kiss
the ground'' when he gets back to Ft. Bragg and then drink a beer
``and have my wife take me out to a restaurant.''
   ``We're all glad to be going home,'' said Spec. 4 Michael Greco,
21, of Pittsburgh, Pa. ``This makes you appreciate what you have at
home,''
   Maj. Gary Hovatter, the U.S. military spokesman for the forces
here, said all of the soldiers from Fort Bragg and Fort Ord should
be home by Wednesday.
   He said some training continued Sunday at bases in Jamastran, in
eastern Honduras, and Tamara in south-central Honduras.
   ``Some of them will be leaving Monday night late. But then the
last guys probably won't be getting out until Wednesday,'' he said.
``They want to make maximum use of all their training time.''

   Richard Gephardt's tough trade
message was a winner in Chick's Rooster Lounge here _ just as it
was in Iowa. But Gephardt never found the momentum from his Iowa
caucus victory and ended up a loser after Michigan's caucuses.
   Gephardt finished a distant third to Jesse Jackson and Michael
Dukakis here, a state that should have been receptive to his trade
message. But the auto industry-dominated state handed the Missouri
congressman his 28th defeat in 31 events this year and doomed his
bid for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination.
   He is expected to formally withdraw from the race. Gephardt
scheduled a news conference Monday afternoon in Washington to
announce his plans.
   Gephardt's clear and consistent message _ a tough trade policy
designed to protect American jobs _ resonated with workers worried
about foreign competition.
   ``I like his enthusiasm, his `Buy America' ideas. ... We have to
take care of ourselves first,'' said bar owner Chick Mahoney,
looking over a restaurant full of workers cheering Gephardt.
   Well-known on Capitol Hill as a leader in the House, but
little-known across the country, Gephardt never could transform
enthusiasm about his message into victories.
   Gephardt worked Iowa hard with the message and won a narrow
victory on Feb. 8. But it wasn't much of a boost.
   ``Gephardt got very little momentum out of Iowa,'' said
Democratic Party professional Elaine Kamarck. His win over Paul
Simon was narrow and Pat Robertson's surprise second-place finish
on the GOP side over George Bush dominated the news.
   ``Once Robertson mucked up the Republican race, the Democrats
lost their best chance to have a giant among the candidates,'' she
said.
   Dukakis won his backyard primary in New Hampshire the next week,
but then Gephardt went into South Dakota and won the primary there
Feb. 23 with his trade message.
   But that was it for Gephardt, except for a homestate win in
Missouri on Super Tuesday.
   Bob Squier, a Democratic media consultant, said Gephardt didn't
freshen his message for the Southern primaries on Super Tuesday and
apparently didn't have the money to get his message out.
   ``If the Hyundai had become a pickup truck as it crossed the
Mason-Dixon line, it might have worked,'' Squier said, referring to
Gephardt's centerpiece trade ad that singled out the Korean car.
   Squier said Gephardt's campaign was guilty of ``kamikaze attacks
in the South'' _ running a lot of ads in parts of Florida, for
example, where Dukakis was very strong.
   Gephardt's message also triggered counterattacks that he seemed
unable to answer adequately.
   ``Everywhere I go, they say he's the protectionist candidate.
That is a great way for the opposition to smear you and get rid of
your issue,'' Gephardt told reporters at lunch one day in New
Hampshire.
   He strongly denied his policies were protectionist, but it was a
charge that he could never shake.
   Gephardt also had strong competition from the other candidates
for his message.
   Jackson, for one, has a powerful message to those worried about
their economic situation. But Jackson is an eloquent speaker of
genuine force, while Gephardt's rhetoric has been honed in the
rarified halls of the Capitol.
   And Jackson says over and over again his message is one of hope
and the future, while Gephardt's emphasis on trade protections
seemed to emphasize what cannot be done, not the possibilities to
come.
   In addition, the Missouri congressman was not known well outside
of Washington. Kamarck said that poses a problem in laying out a
strong message that some may not like, since the voters do not know
enough about the candidate to trust him, even if they may have
doubts about his message.
   Gephardt's populist, anti-establishment themes also met with
skepticism from reporters and others who knew him to be the
consummate Washington insider.
   His message also never brought him the organizational support he
needed.
   The United Auto Workers stayed officially neutral, a major blow
to his chances.
   In Iowa, the state affiliate backed Gephardt and gave him troops
he used to win. In Michigan, the UAW was badly splintered.
   UAW president Owen Bieber, appearing at a news conference two
days before the caucuses in Michigan, would not even say he was
personally going to vote for Gephardt. The Missouri congressman
stood at Bieber's side grim-faced as the union leader ducked
reporters' questions.
   ``I came here today because I want to pay my respects to Dick
and the union wants to pay its respects to him,'' Beiber said.
   Beiber sounded as if he was saying good-bye to Gephardt's
presidential campaign. And the results on Saturday suggested that
was exactly what was happening.

   The Sandinista government freed 100
political prisoners Sunday under an amnesty program, fulfilling the
first part of a cease-fire pact with Nicaraguan rebels.
   Interior Minister Tomas Borge called the gesture ``possibly the
beginning of the end of the war.''
   Tearful family members embraced their loved ones who were
released from the Zona Franca jail on the outskirts of Managua. But
amid the joy was an air of doubt.
   ``They say I don't have anything to fear,'' said Feliz Pedro
Chavaria Gomez, 32, holding a plastic sack containing his
belongings. ``I'm happy, but I hope it doesn't fail.''
   Chavaria said he was arrested in 1980 and charged with being a
counter-revolutionary.
   Cesar Augusto Flores Mireando, 25, was arrested more than two
years ago in Managua. ``The majority of the peasants here are
innocent,'' he said.
   The release of the prisoners was the first step in an amnesty
plan the Sandinistas agreed to Wednesday when they signed a
cease-fire accord with leaders of the U.S.-backed rebels known as
Contras. The sides declared a truce March 21 and a a 60-day
cease-fire is to begin April 1.
   In another development, President Daniel Ortega suggested the
United Nations send a multi-national peacekeeping force to the
Nicaraguan-Honduran border to stabilize the area.
   Of the prisoners freed Sunday, 24 were workers arrested for
joining illegal strikes.
   The release was ordered under an amnesty law the National
Assembly approved by a margin of 82-2 Saturday night. The law could
result in the release of about 3,300 political prisoners jailed
since the Sandinistas seized power in a 1979 revolution that
overthrew right-wing President Anastasio Somoza.
   Sandinistas hold 61 seats in the 96-member assembly.
   According to the legislation, another undisclosed number of
Contras taken prisoner during the six-year civil war will be
released at an unspecified later date. The government also plans a
general review of the cases of about 1,800 members of Somoza's
now-disbanded National Guard, Ortega said.
   Speaking to reporters Saturday night, Ortega said the former
guardsmen all have been accused of human rights violations or
crimes against humanity _ such as the indiscriminate shooting of
civilians _ during the one-year revolution that brought the
Sandinistas to power.
   Many of them have been sentenced to the maximum penalty of 30
years imprisonment, Ortega said. The downfall of Somoza, a rightist
pro-American strongman, ended 42-years of iron-fisted rule by his
family, usually enforced by the National Guard.
   Ortega said the case of each guardsmen will be sent to the
Organization of American States' InterAmerican Human Rights
Commission for review before a release is ordered to safeguard the
Sandinista government from criticism that it acted unfairly.
   On Saturday, Ortega said he had told Gilberto Schilittler, head
of the U.N. delegation, that ``it is important to achieve the
stabilization of the border zone with Honduras and this is only
possible with a multilateral force.''
   Ortega said that without a peacekeeping force, ``the United
States can continue heating up the border ... provoking conflicts,
increasing its presence to threaten Nicaragua.''
   The U.N. team inspected the border Thursday and Friday, scene of
a reported incursion into Honduras by Sandinista army troops
pursuing Contra rebels.
   The Sandinistas pardoned and released 900 political and rebel
prisoners in October and November as a goodwill gesture in an
unsuccessful effort to bring the Contras to the bargaining table.
   But in a surprise move, leaders of the Contra umbrella
organization, the Nicaraguan Resistance, met with the Sandinistas
last week and agreed Thursday on a 60-day cease-fire beginning
April 1. Further negotiations will follow to reach a more permanent
truce.
   An informal cease-fire both sides had agreed to while the
negotiations were in progress continued to hold Sunday.
   An estimated 50,000 people have been killed or wounded since the
Contra war against the Sandinistas began in November 1981.
   Ortega said the two sides will meet again on Monday in the
little southern village of Sapoa, near the Costa Rican border, to
continue talks.
   The negotiations will now center on so-called ``truce areas''
where the Contras can gather, and later turn in their weapons.
   Sunday's amnesty was demanded by the Contras as a condition for
further talks. It is also called for under a regional peace plan
that Ortega and the four other Central American presidents signed
last August.
   The plan aims at negotiating an end to the Contra war and to
leftist guerrilla wars in El Salvador and Guatemala.
   In Honduras, about 3,200 American troops, sent in two weeks ago
by President Reagan when Sandinista troops allegedly entered
Honduras in pursuit of Contra rebels, prepared to return home on
Monday.
   The Reagan administration said they were sent both to bolster
the Honduran government and as a warning to the Sandinistas against
further incursions.

   Court records scheduled to be unsealed this
week may cast some light on death threats authorities say a
prosecutor apparently fabricated.
   U.S. Magistrate Ronald J. Hedges last week gave the government
until Wednesday to object to his decision to unseal about eight of
29 pages of transcripts of conversations he had with special
Assistant U.S. Attorney Judy G. Russell about the threats.
   The discussions, from which defense attorneys were excluded,
came during hearings Feb. 1-5 on a request to extradite two Sikhs
accused by the Indian government of terrorism in that nation.
   The hearings, which resulted in a decision to allow the pair to
be extradited, took place amid extraordinary security because of
alleged death threats to Ms. Russell and an anonymous letter to
Hedges. U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. disclosed last Monday
that the threats apparently were manufactured by Ms. Russell.
   No charges have been filed in connection with the alleged
threats. Alito said an internal affairs division of the Justice
Department is investigating. He hasn't suggested any motive for the
threats.
   Alito has alleged that Ms. Russell cut out words from magazines
to form threatening messages and mailed them to herself.
   In part of an affidavit Hedges already released, Ms. Russell
mentioned four mailed threats in requesting tight security at the
extradition hearing.
   Ms. Russell also allegedly told FBI agents a threat was
hand-delivered to her Feb. 4 when she was staying in a secret hotel
location under 24-hour guard. An FBI affidavit released last Monday
said none of the guards noticed anyone enter the area during the
time she claimed to have received the threat.
   Ronald Kuby, attorney for Sikh defendant Sukhminder Singh, also
said Ms. Russell told the FBI a fabricated story about a suspect
who allegedly shouted at her in a mall. A federal official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed Kuby's statement.
   Her former colleagues in the U.S. attorney's office have refused
to comment publicly, as has Ms. Russell's attorney Robert Fettweis.
Fettweis has said only that Ms. Russell is in seclusion in a
``private hospital.''
   Ms. Russell left the U.S. attorney's office to enter private
practice before the extradition hearing, and returned to handle it
as a special assistant U.S. attorney.
   Singh and the second Sikh, Ranjit Singh Gill, have asked a
federal judge in New York to review Hedges' extradition decision.
   Alito has said he does not think the threats affected the
extradition decision, but he wants a new hearing to avoid the
appearance of impropriety. His office and defense attorneys are
deciding how to proceed with the case.

   Julian Pierce was a rarity in racially
troubled Robeson County, respected by blacks, Indians and whites,
but many of his supporters believe he was slain because someone
didn't want a Lumbee Indian to be a judge.
   ``There is absolute shock,'' the Rev. Mac Legerton said Sunday.
``There is a feeling among people that `Oh my God, we tried to seek
change through the electoral process, and look what happens ....'
   ``We are hoping that all the citizens will choose non-violent
means to resolve our massive difficulties here.''
   Pierce's death early Saturday from three shotgun blasts at
point-blank range appeared to be the first time in the state that a
candidate for political office had been murdered, said Robert
Morgan, director of the State Bureau of Investigation. No one had
been arrested Sunday.
   Pierce, 42, was running for a superior court judgeship and would
have been the first Lumbee Indian to serve in the post in Robeson
County if he had been elected.
   Pierce had been alone in his brick ranch house, which is flanked
by farmland and another small house.
   ``Someone was at the (kitchen) door and when he went to the
door, they were waiting for him,'' Robeson County Sheriff Hubert
Stone said.
   ``It just looked like he was actually assassinated,'' Stone said
Saturday.
   ``The Indians are going to have to take the law into their own
hands ... to protect their selves, family and friends,'' a local
resident, Earl Moore, said Saturday at Pierce's home.
   Moore, who said he had known Pierce for 15 years, said the
candidate ``knew that something could happen'' to him. Moore said
he knew of a threat against Pierce, but said he would talk only to
federal officials in Washington, not to county, state or federal
officials in North Carolina.
   ``There's a lot of leads that are being pursued,'' state
investigator Cuyler Windham said Sunday, declining to elaborate.
``We've interviewed numerous people, and we will continue to follow
every lead that comes up.''
   Robeson County, which borders on South Carolina, is 37 percent
white, 37 percent Indian and 26 percent black. It is one of the
state's poorest counties, and has long been torn by racial
animosity.
   Activism, particularly by Lumbees, has thrived since November
1986 when an unarmed Lumbee was shot and killed by a sheriff's
deputy.
   Anger at what the Indians call corrupt local government and
entrenched racism boiled over most recently Feb. 1, when two
Lumbees took hostages at The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton, the
county seat. Eddie Hatcher and Timothy Jacobs said they engineered
the siege in order to attract attention.
   In a telephone interview from prison with The Winston-Salem
Journal Saturday night, Hatcher called on Gov. Jim Martin to
appoint a special prosecutor to investigate both his allegations
and the Pierce killing.
   ``How many dead Indians and execution-style killings of our
people shall it take before you, Governor Martin, bestow upon our
people the long overdue justice we deserve?'' Hatcher asked.
   About 100 people stood quietly outside Pierce's home Saturday.
   ``He didn't have any enemies,'' Gladys Freeman, a Lumbee, said
of Pierce, a lawyer who resigned from his post as director of a
legal-aid organization for the poor in January to run for the
judgeship. ``Who could hate him? No one could.''
   ``It makes me think there's no hope for the Indians,'' said
Janice Locklear, also a Lumbee. ``I'm so mad I could fight.''
   People questioned outside Pierce's home said they thought he
would have won the election against Joe Freeman Britt, a white who
has been district attorney in the county for 14 years.
   They cited a vote earlier this month to consolidate the county's
five school systems, which had been divided along racial lines.
Advocates of consolidation, largely Lumbee and black, narrowly won
the vote in this rural, underdeveloped county of 100,000 people.
   An impromptu news conference outside Pierce's house by Stone and
Morgan brought heckling from members of the crowd, who asked as
many questions of the law enforcement authorities as did reporters.
   Stone, a white, said he considered Pierce a friend, and Britt
called the murder ``sad and tragic'' in a statement.
   Pierce grew up in neighboring Hoke County and worked in a
Virginia shipyard after graduating from college. He returned to
North Carolina and attended North Carolina Central University law
school, then worked for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
from 1976 to 1978.
   He then moved to Robeson County to serve as the first director
of Lumbee River Legal Services, representing those too poor to
afford lawyers and practicing public interest law.
   ``He was an easygoing guy. He never had no problem with anyone
that I heard tell of. People liked him,'' Stone said.
   The election effectively was to be decided May 3 _ the date of
the Democratic primary _ since no Republicans were in the race.
Britt and Pierce were the only candidates, and community leaders
said they weren't sure if another candidate could be entered at
this late date.
   Robeson County had been given its own judicial district in order
to give minorities a better chance of electing a judge. The county
had previously been part of a larger district.
   At a rally in February, Pierce said he was running for the post
because minorities were not respected by the criminal justice
system that they were not a part of.
   ``I promise you one thing _ if I'm elected judge, I'll be a just
judge because I think we need that, but I won't see color,'' he
said.

   A state senator who told police he was
shot by his wife after he returned home from a special legislative
session improved from critical to serious condition Sunday, a
spokeswoman at LSU Medical Center said.
   Greg Tarver, 41, a second-term senator, told police that his
wife, Sabrina, shot him and that he didn't want to press charges,
Police Chief Charles Gruber said at a news conference late Saturday.
   ``She is not in custody. ... We are not looking for her,'' he
said.
   Mrs. Tarver could not be located for comment Sunday. Nobody
answered at the Tarvers' home number. Sam Jones, who answered the
telephone at the funeral home Tarver runs, said the whole family
was at the hospital. Reporters there did not see Mrs. Tarver.
   Tarver was in intensive care after 4{ hours of surgery, said
hospital spokeswoman Elaine King.
   Doctors said they repaired blood vessels damaged by a
.25-caliber bullet that tore through Tarver's chest Saturday.
   It's up to Tarver whether to have his wife arrested, Gruber
said: ``If a victim doesn't wish to pursue a case, then you have no
case. Although we will try to put our case together in case he
should change his mind.''
   ``I feel sure that once we get everything together we will turn
it all over to the district attorney and let him look at it and see
what he thinks,'' said Detective Sgt. Rick Ware.
   Charges often are not filed in domestic violence cases, said
District Attorney Paul Carmouche.
   The shooting happened less than an hour after Tarver, one of a
handful of blacks in the 39-member Louisiana Senate, returned from
the special session in Baton Rouge. Gruber said Tarver's mother,
Balistine Hopkins, reported the shooting.
   Tarver, who will be 42 Wednesday, was one of three blacks
elected to the Shreveport City Council in 1978 _ the first blacks
ever elected to the council.
   He became the city's first black state senator in 1984 after a
bitter campaign against incumbent Bill Keith, who ran a television
commercial showing police mug shots of Tarver and listing 14
arrests from 1967 to 1973. Most of the arrests were on charges of
disturbing the peace and resisting arrest during civil rights
protests.
   Tarver was sworn in for a second four-year term March 14.

   The rain-swollen Danube River
burst through dikes along its banks in Bavaria Sunday, forcing the
evacuation of hundreds of people. Flooding throughout West Germany
has taken at least two lives.
   Water was up to a foot deep in Niederachdorf, a Bavarian hamlet
25 miles east of Regensburg.
   Radio reports said about 2,000 people were being evacuated from
Niederachdorf and other communities in that area.
   Officials said the Danube swept away sections of earthen dikes
15 feet high.
   Many rivers in West Germany, including the Rhine, Mosel, Donlau
and Neckar, are flooding from heavy rains and rapidly melting snow
in the Alps.
   A 61-year-old Coblenz man perished Sunday after going to his
flooded cellar to check the fuse box, police reported. They said he
received an electrical shock, fell into the water and drowned.
   On Saturday, a 3-year-old-boy in Bamberg drowned in flood
waters, according to police.
   Delegates at a Greens party convention in Ludwigshafen near
Heidelberg had to find another place to stay Saturday night when
water from the Rhine flowed through the youth hostel where they had
gathered.
   In Lower Saxony state, sections of 29 roads were under water
Sunday.

   Premier Turgut Ozal said Sunday that Turkey
might fire at Iranian and Iraqi warplanes to stop them from
violating Turkish airspace, state radio reported.
   Ozal made the statement to reporters during a weekend vacation
in this northwestern resort.
   He was quoted as saying, ``We will take measures against planes
violating our airspace. These measures may include opening fire at
them if necessary.''
   Turkey borders Iran and Iraq, which have been at war since
September 1980, and has remained neutral.
   On Friday, the Foreign Ministry announced that Turkey had
protested to Iran over the bombing of a border post on the
Turkish-Iraqi frontier.
   The ministry said the attack by an Iranian warplane on Thursday
appeared to be aimed at destroying the Habur bridge on the main
highway connecting Iraq and Turkey.
   Five bombs failed to hit the bridge and there were no
casualties, according to the ministry.
   Iran denied the incident and called on Turkey to stop Iraqi
combat jets from crossing through Turkish airspace to attack Iran.

<HEAD>Prosecutor: Chambers Stole Checks to Buy Cocaine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convicted killer Robert Chambers forged $7,000
in stolen checks just before his murder trial began and used much
of the money to buy cocaine, the prosecutor at the trial has
charged.
   Chambers' lawyer, Jack Litman, angrily denied the allegations by
Assistant District Attorney Linda Fairstein, made in published
reports Sunday. Litman said she had made them ``in an obvious
effort to save face'' because the trial did not end with a murder
verdict.
   In a surprise ending to the so-called ``preppie murder'' trial
Friday, Chambers pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter in the
August 1986 death of 18-year-old Jennifer Levin.
   The 21-year-old college dropout had maintained throughout the
12-week trial that Miss Levin's death had been an accident, caused
when he grabbed her and threw her off him after she hurt him during
a sexual encounter in Central Park. But he acknowledged in his
guilty plea to manslaughter that he had intended to hurt her.
   Ms. Fairstein said Saturday that her office received a tip from
an informant that Chambers had stolen the checks in October and
used the money for ``drugs and petty cash.'' She did not identify
the victim, but the Daily News said court sources described the
victim as an elderly woman who possibly was senile.
   ``Our belief is that he stole and forged $7,000 worth of
checks,'' the prosecutor said. ``We knew he was buying drugs, but
at first we didn't know where he was getting the money. It went
straight up his nose.''
   As part of the plea bargain that brought the trial to an end,
Chambers pleaded guilty to one unrelated burglary charge, one of
three that had been brought against him. Under the bargain, he is
immune from prosecution from any other past crimes.
   Prosecutors had said that the burglaries were committed to
support Chambers' cocaine habit, for which he was institutionalized
twice.
   Ms. Fairstein said the check theft was ``minor stuff,'' that
probably would have ended up as a misdemeanor.
   Litman called the allegations ``scandalous.'' He said Ms.
Fairstein was upset that Chambers pleaded guilty to manslaughter
``when they proclaimed from the rooftops that he intentionally
murdered Jennifer Levin.''
   Chambers entered the plea Friday as jurors remained deadlocked
on their ninth day of deliberations in the highly publicized case.
Both sides feared a hung jury that would have required another
emotionally draining trial.
   Chambers entered the Rikers Island jail on Saturday to await
sentencing April 15. Under the plea bargain, he faces a
five-to-15-year prison term.

   Mordechai Vanunu, the former nuclear technician
who said he acted as a spy for the common man when he gave Israeli
atomic secrets to a newspaper, was sentenced Sunday to 18 years in
prison. He was convicted of treason and espionage.
   The sentencing climaxed a seven-month closed-door trial that
focused worldwide attention on Israel's nuclear capability.
   The 34-year-old Israeli, who told a British newspaper his
country possessed nuclear weapons, was convicted Thursday.
   The charges can carry a death penalty. But the prosecution
requested a life term, which Israeli law limits to 20 years. The
court then reduced the term by two years, citing Vanunu's
cooperation with investigators, apparent signs of regret and the
difficult conditions of his 18-month solitary confinement.
   Under Israeli law, Vanunu could be released on good behavior
after 12 years. But legal commentators said his early release was
unlikely given the severity of the crimes.
   Defense attorney Avigdor Feldman has said he will appeal his
client's case to Israel's Supreme Court.
   The sentencing ended an affair shrouded in secrecy that began
when Vanunu, a 10-year employee of Israel's Dimona nuclear
facility, gave photographs and details of the facility to The
Sunday Times of London.
   Based on that information, the paper reported Israel had
stockpiled the world's sixth largest nuclear arsenal.
   Israel has never confirmed or denied that it has nuclear
weapons. It has said only it will not be the first country to
introduce such weapons into the Middle East.
   Vanunu, a Jewish-born convert to Christianity, testified during
his trial that he made his revelations to warn the world of the
dangers of nuclear weapons, not for personal gain or out of a
desire to harm his country.
   In a poem quoted by his attorney on Israeli television after the
verdict, Vanunu called himself a ``spy for the common man.''
   He had negotiated a lucrative contract with The Sunday Times
pending publication of a never-completed book and earlier
approached several news organizations offering to sell his story
for large sums.
   Vanunu made a final appeal at Sunday's court session, but his
remarks were not made public and his attorney refused to talk to
waiting reporters.
   Vanunu's family, however, expressed bitterness.
   ``The trial was not conducted as it should have been,'' said
Vanunu's brother, Asher Vanunu. He said he would try to galvanize
international support to press authorities for his brother's
release.
   Meir Vanunu, another brother who lives in London, said in an
interview with British Broadcasting Co. television, ``Israel wasn't
able to give justice to Mordechai.''
   He said Israel was trying to shield its nuclear capability ``in
all the kinds of games that they played about it for the last 25
years.''
   Meir Vanunu faces arrest in Israel for leaking details of his
brother's journey to Israel from London in October 1986, several
days after The Sunday Times published Vanunu's revelations.
   He told journalists his brother was lured from London to Rome by
an American woman named Cindy, presumably an Israeli agent, who
promised him sex. Then he was abducted by Israeli agents and
spirited back to Israel for trial, he said.
   Meir Vanunu, 32, read a statement Sunday night to The Associated
Press.
   ``This trial began by kidnapping, continued in total secrecy and
ended by putting the narrow interests of the state before the
interests of humanity,'' the statement said.
   ``Legally, it is only the end of a chapter; our struggle to free
him continues. Politically, by this trial, Israel has admitted that
it has the bomb. It was my brother's wish to make the Middle East
nuclear free. It is up to the rest of the world to pick up this
challenge.''
   In response to a question, Meir Vanunu said he had asked the
Italian and British governments to intervene. ``It's the
responsiblity of the British and Italian governments to take some
diplomatic steps, or any kind of action, to clear up this situation
and demand the return of Mordechai to Europe, where he was taken
from,'' he said.
   Before a pre-trial court appearance, Mordechai Vanunu managed to
flash reporters a message scribbled on the palm of his hand saying
he had been kidnapped in Rome. The incident embarrassed authorities
and led to increased security precautions.
   Vanunu has received almost no support from Israelis, many of
whom view him as a traitor.
   But his cause has been adopted by international groups including
anti-nuclear activists, scientists, politicians and the
London-based Amnesty International human rights group. British
peace activists and legislators nominated him for the Nobel Peace
Prize last summer.
   During Sunday's sentencing hearing, defense attorney Feldman
presented a petition from noted American scientists, including 18
Nobel Prize laureates, asking for leniency, Israel radio said.
   The judges, however, denied a defense request to allow an
American expert on international law to testify at the hearing.
   The expert, Richard Falk of Princeton University in New Jersey,
said he was shocked the court refused to let him testify and
criticized Vanunu's conviction.
   ``Individual conscience is more important in the nuclear age
than the security of the state,'' he said. ``The state can be
wrong.''

<DATELINE>HILLSBORO, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A truck driver convicted of gunning down
two men found slain in a wildlife area should die in the gas
chamber, a jury recommended Sunday.
   Donald Edward Reese, 44, coolly listened as a court clerk read
the jury's recommendation that he receive the death sentence.
   The jury Friday convicted Reese in the Sept. 9, 1986, deaths of
James R. Watson, 54, of Jefferson City, and Christopher Griffith,
38, of Columbia. They and two other men were found dead in the
Marshall Junction Wildlife Area in central Missouri.
   Prosecutor Weldon Perry Jr. claimed Reese had stalked the
wildlife area ``looking for money.''
   A first-degree murder charge was filed Friday in the death of
another of the victims, John C. Burford, 57, of Sedalia. A charge
in the slaying of the fourth man, Donald A. Vanderlinden, 64, of
Independence, was dropped last year but can be re-filed later.
   Sentencing was set for May 6. Jefferson County Circuit Judge
John Anderson can either adopt the jury's recommendation or
sentence Reese to life in prison without probation or parole.
   The trial was moved to Jefferson County because of extensive
pretrial publicity in Saline County, where the killings occurred.
   After the killings, Reese directed law officers to the wallets
of Vanderlinden, Burford and Watson, as well as to $1,200 in cash
stuffed into a soup can hidden by a tree, according to testimony.
   After the sentence was read in the packed courtroom, Watson's
daughter, Kathy Watson, 26, wept quietly. Tears also streamed down
the face of Reese's sister, Elsie Smith.

   A trial in the slashing and stabbing death
of a worker at an Atlanta fine arts center ended with life
sentences for the victim's wife and a man who claimed he was trying
to aid a friend's suicide.
   Nora Ventura Broomall, 52, of Clarkston, and Cecil Eugene
Booher, 36, of Atlanta, were convicted of murder Saturday and
sentenced for the Oct. 9 slaying of Mrs. Broomall's husband,
George, 50, a maintenance worker at the Callanwolde Fine Arts
Center.
   Throughout the two-week trial, prosecutors contended that Mrs.
Broomall arranged her husband's death, hiring Booher for $25,000 in
hopes of collecting $100,000 in insurance money.
   Broomall's throat was slashed and he had been stabbed twice in
the chest when he was found in an upstairs hallway at Callanwolde,
located in a 1920s Tudor-style mansion in Atlanta's stately Druid
Hills neighborhood.
   Booher, who says he has acquired immune deficiency syndrome and
called himself ``a walking dead man,'' also was found guilty of two
counts of burglary for taking stereo equipment and liquor from the
arts center after the slaying.
   Defense attorneys contended Broomall planned his own death,
getting Booher to help him commit suicide in an attempt to leave
the insurance money to his wife.
   Chief Assistant District Attorney Steve Roberts said he was
pleased with the convictions.
   ``I think it's a pretty heinous thing to hire someone to kill
your spouse for money,'' Roberts said. ``This puts to rest the
theory and speculation that Mr. Broomall wanted to commit suicide,
which we never believed for a minute.''
   Booher's attorney, Darel Mitchell, said he was unsure if his
client would appeal, given his medical condition.
   ``A life sentence in this case may have a whole new meaning,''
Mitchell said. ``He will receive treatment while he is in custody,
where if he were free, he has no insurance for medical care.''
   Al Hartley, attorney for Mrs. Broomall, said she probably will
appeal.
   The case already has attracted the attention of people
interested in securing book and movie rights, both defense
attorneys said.
   ``The facts of this case just happen to be bizarre enough to
attract a movie producer's attention,'' said Assistant District
Attorney Mike McDaniel. ``But I certainly would not like to think
that anyone would benefit from criminal conduct.''

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American woman attempting a solo hike to the
North Pole and a British team making a similar trek without sled
dogs or snowmobiles abandoned their dreams Sunday because of foul
weather.
   Pam Flowers of Willow, Alaska, gave up her second bid to become
the first woman to travel alone to the pole after facing unstable
weather, losing her glasses in a fall and two uneasy confrontations
with a polar bear, according to Rudy Kellar. He is base manager for
Bradley Air Service at Resolute in Canada's Northwest Territories.
   Kellar said that also on Sunday, three members of a British team
led by Sir Ranulph Fiennes were picked up by a plane after
traveling only 36 miles in more than three weeks,
   Fiennes, 43, and his companions were attempting to become the
first people to walk to the pole without the aid of sled dogs,
motorized transport or airlifted supplies. It was his second
attempt.
   Fiennes, suffering frostbite in two toes, gave up because
``weather conditions were absolutely horrific,'' Penny Studholme, a
spokesman for the expedition, said in London.
   She said storms and extreme swings in temperature loosened pack
ice, making it ``like glue'' for the the team struggling with sleds
loaded with supplies.
   The adventurers had set out March 10 to walk the 410 miles to
the pole from their base camp at Ward Hunt Island, 1,200 above the
Arctic Circle. Fiennes was accompanied on the hike by Mike Stroud
and Oliver Shephard.
   Ms. Flowers, 43, had been traveling a route parallel to the
British team's, using sled dogs.
   She was picked up by a plane after traveling 12 miles north of
Ward Hunt Island at the northern tip of Ellesmere Island. She had
abandoned a similar attempt last year.
   Kellar said a polar bear wandered into her camp twice, ripping
up her tent at one point, and her three sled dogs drove off the
bear with their howling.
   Radio messages received by the British base camp said Ms.
Flowers fell from an ice ridge on Thursday, and she was knocked
unconscious and broke her glasses. Kellar said the loss of the
glasses was a factor in her decision to call off the trip.

<HEAD>Irish Fire Brigade Goes Shopping In Dublin, Ohio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After stopping in Dublins in Indiana, North
Carolina, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Georgia and Kentucky,
six firefighters from the oldest Dublin of them all came to the
newest city of Dublin.
   ``This is the biggest Dublin we've been to in the United States
and the most modern,'' said Seamus O'Connor, 44, station officer of
the Dublin, Ireland, Fire Department and coordinator of the
three-week visit. ``But it's very Irish-connected.''
   This Columbus suburb, population 14,000, dates to the 19th
century, but it assumed city status under state law only last
September. By contrast, Dublin, Ireland, is marking its 1,000th
birthday this year.
   Mary Margaret McLernon, coordinator of the Dublin-Irish
celebration in Dublin, Ohio, said a mid-19th-century planner born
in Dublin, Ireland, gave the town its name. Ohio's rolling hills,
trees and greenery, and the Scioto River reminded him of the Irish
countryside and the Liffey River that flows through Ireland's
Dublin, she said.
   The firefighters, nearing the end of their 4,000-mile tour of
American towns named Dublin, spent Sunday shopping with escorts and
planned to present Mayor Michael L. Close with Dublin crystal at a
concert of Irish folk music. They arrived in Dublin, Ohio, in a
motor home on Saturday from Dublin, Ind., and were expected to
leave Monday morning for New York City and return to Ireland on
Thursday.
   ``The purpose of our trip was to share greetings of native Irish
with the offspring Dublins and to encourage people to come visit us
during our anniversary year to take part in the festivities,''
O'Connor said.
   The Irish Tourist Board arranged for the firefighters to get the
motor home free of charge, he said. And Aer Lingus _ the Irish
airline _ gave each firefighter a round-trip ticket to New York.
   O'Connor said the visitors have received letters from
schoolchildren during their travels and will give them to Irish
children when they return home. They've also met fellow
firefighters along the way _ and even helped a few of them.
   ``While in Dublin, Georgia, we helped out the local fire station
with a bad car accident,'' O'Connor said. ``That's the beauty of
it. Firemen all over the world have a basic connection.''
   Washington Township Firefighter Rick Aston said he enjoyed
swapping fire stories with the visitors.
   ``You always do that with a bunch of firefighters,'' he said.

   The official Soviet press reported Sunday that
most business had halted and militiamen were blocking central
streets in a city at the center of a dispute between Armenians and
another Soviet ethnic group.
   Dissidents described the stoppage in Stepanakert, in a region
that Armenians want transferred from the control of the republic of
Azerbaijan to the neighboring republic of Armenia, as a general
strike.
   Soviet reports said more than 1,500 civilian auxiliary police
had moved into the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait and that similar
forces patrolled the Azerbaijani capital of Baku.
   Stepanakert is in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Sumgait, the scene of ethnic clashes that left at least 32 dead in
late February, is in the Sumgait District of Azerbaijan.
   In Armenia, troops with attack dogs were deployed Saturday in
the capital of Yerevan to crack down on street rallies calling for
Nagorno-Karabakh's annexation by Armenia, the official press said.
   A Moscow dissident, Alexander Ogorodnikov, on Saturday described
Yerevan as a ``dead city'' with most people staying inside in
silent protest.
   Armenians began strikes and street rallies Feb. 13 in
Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh's main city, demanding that the
region be united with Armenia.
   Armenians make up more than three-quarters of Nagorno-Karabakh's
population, but they say they suffer racial, cultural and economic
discrimination in Azerbaijan. Most Armenians are Christians, while
Azerbaijanis are mostly Shiite Moslems.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said Sunday that authorities
blocked the central streets of Stepanakert and that militiamen were
patrolling Saturday.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported Sunday that 1,500
civilian auxiliary police had been deployed in Sumgait and in Baku.
   ``Only reinforced voluntary public order squads, made up of
workers with red armbands who assist militia in the streets,
indicate that some tension still persists in Baku,'' Pravda said.
   The Armenian nationalist protests subsided after Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed Feb. 26 for restraint, promising
social and economic improvements.
   But on Wednesday, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the
country's highest executive body, brushed aside the annexation
demand.
   Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh then called for a general strike.
It began Wednesday, Moscow dissident Sergei Grigoryants said Sunday.
   Izvestia said Sunday in a report from Stepanakert: ``Enterprises
in the city today (Saturday) aren't working, except for essential
services such as bread and milk factories, transport, water
supply.''
   Pravda said: ``There is a relative lull in Nagorno-Karabakh .. .
but the majority of enterprises of the regional center,
Stepanakert, are idle.''
   None of the articles, however, attributed the disruptions to a
strike.
   Andrei Bavitsky of the dissident journal Glasnost had said in
Moscow that 15,000 local policemen were patrolling Stepanakert
Saturday.
   Grigoryants, a former political prisoner who is half ethnic
Russian and half Armenian, said the Stepanakert strike was
scheduled to last through Friday.
   Bavitsky and Grigoryants said they received their information
from telephone contacts in the region. The government has barred
foreign correspondents from the area and prevented phone calls to
the region Sunday.
   Armenian and Azerbaijani media have warned activists of
``unpredictable consequences'' if they carry out demonstrations or
strikes. At least four Armenian activists have been arrested in
Yerevan.
   At least one of those arrested, Paruyr Ayrikyan, was charged
under a law which Gorbachev's administration has said was under
review, according to dissidents.
   Press Club Glasnost, an unsanctioned Moscow group of human
rights activists, said Sunday it learned from Ayrikyan's relatives
that he was charged under a law barring the defamation of the
Soviet Union.
   ``The very fact of Ayrikyan's arrest and charge represents a
serious step backward, a retreat to the times of repression against
every independent opinion, every free word,'' Press Club Glasnost
said in an appeal to Gorbachev to free Ayrikyan.
   Ayrikyan, 38, headed an underground Armenian nationalist group
called the National Unification Party and was jailed for 17 years
beginning in 1969 for his political activities. He is chairman of a
nationalist group called Alliance for National Determination.

   Eleven singers were selected as winners Sunday
at the 34th annual finals competition of the prestigious
Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions.
   Some 2,000 contestants, ages 19 to 35, competed in the
auditions, which began on the district level in August in the
United States, Puerto Rico, Canada and Australia, said Anne Porter,
a council spokeswoman.
   The 11 winners, chosen from 26 finalists, won a grant of $5,000,
as well as the coveted opportunity to sing in the annual winners
concert on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House on Sunday,
April 10.
   The finalists on Sunday were judged by 12 members of the
Metropolitan Opera artistic staff, including conductors, singers,
artistic directors and language experts, Mrs. Porter said.
   The winners are: Renee Fleming, 28, soprano, of New York;
Richard Drews, 34, tenor, of Chicago; Leroy Villanueva, 25,
baritone, of Altadena, Calif.; Lynda Keith, 27, soprano, of
Cincinnati; Heidi Lynn Grant, 22, soprano, of Bloomington, Ind.;
and Carolyn G. James, 25, soprano, of New York.
   Also: Ben Heppner, 32, tenor, of Scarborough, Ontario in Canada;
Wendy Hoffman, 27, mezzo-soprano, of San Francisco; Haijing Fu, 30,
baritone, of Brookline, Mass.; Helen Smedley Carter, 30, soprano,
of Collingswood, N.J.; and Susan Graham, 27, mezzo-soprano, of New
York.
   Each of the 26 finalists received a $1,000 award and one week of
training in preparation for the finals. In addition to the prize
money and the chance to participate in the April concert, the
winners are to receive two more weeks of training by the Met
artistic staff to prepare for the concert.
   During 34 years of auditions, the Metropolitan Opera National
Council has heard more than 50,000 young singers, Mrs. Porter said.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Police capitalized on heavy betting during the NCAA basketball
tournament to raid 17 suspected gambling houses in two cities and
arrest 25 people, authorities said.
   The arrests Saturday in Philadelphia and New York City's Staten
Island capped a four-month investigation that started with a tip
from the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, said New York Police
Capt. Thomas J. Richardson.
   ``We feel it's an enormous operation,'' he said.
   Among those arrested was Joseph W. Landmesser, 43, of
Wallingford, Pa., who police said coordinated gambling operations
between the two cities and was a leader of a coast-to-coast network.
   He was held for arraignment on charges of possession of gambling
records and promoting gambling, police said.
   ``It's a nationwide sports betting operation,'' said
Philadelphia Police Sgt. Jesse Strange. ``It's very sophisticated.
They have entered the electronic age. The old way was to write bets
down on paper; now, they're into computers and toll-free numbers.''
   Philadelphia police, along with IRS agents and members of the
Pennsylvania Crime Commission, raided 12 houses Saturday, taking 14
people into custody. The suspects were charged with either
bookmaking or running an illegal lottery and conspiracy.
   Strange said the raids netted records for 11,192 sports bets
valued at $3,387,450, records for $1,378,600 in other bets and
records for 8,246 illegal lottery bets valued at about $7,200.
Police also seized $8,107 in cash, he said.
   The raids were timed to capitalize on betting related to the
National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament,
Strange said.
   In New York, 11 people, including eight from California, were
arrested at five locations on Staten Island, police said. The
out-of-state suspects had moved to Staten Island after operations
elsewhere had been uncovered, Lt. John Costello said.
   Police had no estimate of the yearly intake of the operation,
but one bettor had an account of over $57,000 in a one-week period,
said Richardson.

   Israel said its troops
killed three Arabs in the West Bank on Sunday after Palestinians
attacked with iron bars and a car, but villagers accused the
soldiers of firing at cars carrying wounded.
   Israeli soldiers killed a fourth Palestinian in another West
Bank town while trying to rescue an Israeli tour bus that blundered
into the Arab community.
   Left-leaning Labor Party ministers, meanwhile, accused Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the rightist Likud block at Sunday's
Cabinet session of exaggerating the success of his U.S. tour that
ended Tuesday, Israel radio reported.
   They said the proof came in U.S. Secretary of State George P.
Shultz's meeting Saturday in Washington with two university
professors linked to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Shultz met with Edward Said and Ibrahim Abu-Lughud, American
citizens who belong to the PLO's legislative arm. The meeting
prompted protests from Israel, which views the PLO as an illegal
terrorist group.
   Sunday's deaths raised to 118 the number of Palestinians killed
in 15 weeks of violent protests against Israel's 20-year occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to U.N. figures. One
Israeli soldier has been killed.
   Israel seized the territories in the 1967 Middle East war.
   In Jaffa, a military court on Sunday convicted Israeli Pvt. Ron
Almog of abandoning his post at a base in northern Israel when a
Palestinian guerrilla flew a hang glider into the area on Nov. 25.
The court sentenced Almog to three years in jail and suspended 1{
years of the sentence.
   Almog fled his post and the guerrilla rushed through the base's
abandoned gate, killing five soldiers and wounding six before he
was killed.
   Soldiers entered the West Bank village of Meithalun about 40
miles north of Jerusalem before dawn to arrest Arabs suspected of
anti-Israeli activities, an army spokesman said.
   The overnight raids are Israel's latest tactic to try to quash
the Palestinian unrest.
   As the soldiers were leaving, the army spokesman said, Arabs
attacked them with rocks and iron bars. When a car tried to run the
soldiers down, the commander of the force fired and three Arabs
were killed, the spokesman said.
   But villagers denied the soldiers were attacked and accused
soldiers of shooting at cars taking wounded to hospitals. One of
the wounded, 16-year-old Ghassan Qassem Noerat, was in a car bound
for a hospital when soldiers shot and killed him, a relative said.
   Hospital officials said he died of a bullet in the chest.
   The relative, his jeans heavily stained with dry blood, refused
to give his name. But villagers displayed a car with a bullet hole
in its radiator and a shattered windshield.
   Ahmad Abdul-Rahman, a village leader, stood near the cemetery
with its three fresh graves and said he came home to find soldiers
who ``asked me to guide them to the wanted men.'' He said troops
arrested 10 to 12 men before shooting broke out.
   Pharmacist Ahmed Rasmi pointed to a rock wall on the eastern
edge of the village and said Omar Mahmoud Rabaiyeh, 23, was shot
there while waiting for his ride to work in Israel.
   Rasmi said Rabaiyeh's relatives inside a nearby house heard his
cries, discovered him wounded and crawling on his hands and knees,
and took him to Rasmi's pharmacy nearby, where Rasmi and doctors
failed to save him. Hospital officials said he had been shot in the
chest.
   In the middle of town, Rasmi and other villagers pointed to the
home of Sahim Mahmoud Noerat, 27, a third fatality. They said he
was shot in the neck at the door to his home as he was leaving for
a nearby mosque for the day's first prayers.
   ``Yes to the PLO!'' was spray-painted on a nearby wall, and at
least four bullet marks were visible in doors and limestone walls
near the house. Three red, green, black and white PLO flags
fluttered beside the mosque a few steps from Noerat's home.
   Several villagers said troops fired glass marbles as well as
rubber bullets and live ammunition. They displayed one of the
transparent, steel-colored marbles.
   Hospital officials in the West Bank cities of Jenin and Nablus
said they treated three other Meithalun residents for bullet
wounds. The army said it could confirm only one wounded.
   The fourth Arab was shot to death when Palestinians attacked
troops who came to the rescue of an Israeli tour bus in Salfit, 20
miles north of Jerusalem, the army spokesman said.
   The spokesman said the driver mistakenly entered the Arab
village, and Arabs stoned the bus. Troops that arrived to help were
also attacked with rocks and bottles, forcing the commander to
fire, he said.
   The Arab-run Palestine Press Service identified the victim as
14-year-old Yasser al-Khirbawi.
   Arabs in the West Bank city of Halhoul, meanwhile, attacked and
burned another Israeli bus carrying Arab workers to jobs in Israel.
Israel radio said the arsonists evacuated the bus before setting it
ablaze.
   In Taibe, an Arab village in northern Israel, police arrested
six Arabs who allegedly threw five firebombs at a police station,
Israel radio said. It was not clear what their motive was.

   High winds and dry tinder fueled a fire
that was burning uncontrolled Sunday night in the Black Hills
National Forest, authorities said.
   ``It is a very large fire,'' said Dick Hawthorne, a dispatcher
at the U.S. Forest Service's Pactola office. ``At one time one of
our fellows called in and said it was about a mile long.''
   The fire was 60 percent contained by fire breaks Sunday evening
after burning an estimated 350 acres, said Forest Service
spokeswoman Dianne Reimers. Winds were expected to kick up again
Monday, but officials did not expect the fire to get much larger,
Ms. Reimers said.
   About 140 firefighters were working to contain the blaze, which
they hoped to have under control by Monday afternoon, she said.
   No one had been evacuated, she said.
   Earlier Sunday, when the Forest Service measured winds at 40 mph
and gusts at 50-60 mph, Hawthorne said about a dozen homes along
Sheridan Lake Road southwest of Rapid City were being monitored.
   Temperatures reached 80 degrees around noon in the Rapid City
area Sunday before a cold front came through and dropped readings
to 50 degrees by 3 p.m.
   The fire-danger index for all of South Dakota was rated
``extreme'' Sunday because of high temperatures, winds and low
relative humidity readings, the National Weather Service said.

   A man gave up his life preserver to save
his son after a boating accident and was missing and presumed
drowned Sunday in the swift-flowing Sandy River.
   George Earl Trenkel, 40, tossed a seat cushion to his son,
George Edward, 18, after their boat hit a submerged log and threw
them into the frigid water Saturday, said Multnomah County
sheriff's deputy Bob Boertien.
   He said the younger Trenkel used the cushion to make his way to
shore, then tried unsuccessfully to throw it back to his father.
   ``I threw the thing to him, but I was so tired, it really didn't
go that far,'' the younger Trenkel said Sunday in a telephone
interview from an uncle's house in Salem.
   ``I could just see his head as he went around a bend,'' he
added. ``I yelled `Dad!' a couple of times, and he said he would be
OK.''
   The elder Trenkel, of Blackfoot, Idaho, was lost about 30 feet
from the bank, Boertien said.
   A search for his body was called off Sunday but was to resume
Monday, authorities said.
   A third man with them, Roland Parkhurst, 40, of Gresham, was
wearing a life jacket. Witnesses pulled the younger Trenkel and
Parkhurst, who is a paraplegic, from the river, Boertien said.
   On the river's bank, Mike Owens of Gresham saw the three men
floundering in the water.
   ``I knew when I saw one guy riding on top of the boat and two
others coming behind them that something was wrong,'' Owens said.
``Then later, I saw what I was sure was a person in the middle of
the river. I thought, `That guy is in real trouble.'''
   The boat was found overturned and washed ashore about a
half-mile downstream from where it hit the log. The bow had almost
been completely broken away.
   The younger Trenkel said his father was rowing when the current
pulled them over a log.
   ``We tried to balance the boat to go over the log, but it
cracked; we lost an oar, and the boat filled up with water. We
tried to dump water out, but ended up jumping out of the boat,'' he
said.
   He said he managed to climb onto the overturned boat for a time,
while his father held onto the boat and Parkhurst held his foot.
   ``Then we hit the rapids, and we all separated from the boat,''
he said.
   He said he was under water ``for quite a while,'' until his
father pulled him to the surface and gave him a seat cushion he had
found.
   The survivors were taken to a hospital in nearby Gresham, where
they were treated and released.
   The younger Trenkel, a senior at Blackfoot High School, said his
father worked as a fireboss for the federal Bureau of Land
Management, and was in Portland for a business meeting. He said his
father and Parkhurst had known each other since high school.

   Gunmen ambushed the two-car convoy of
a mayor Monday, wounding the official and killing seven of his
bodyguards, police reported.
   They said Prospero Oreta, mayor of the Manila suburb of Malabon
and related by marriage to President Corazon Aquino, suffered
several bullet wounds.
   The acting governor of metropolitan Manila, Efren Cruz, told
reporters Oreta was hospitalized and ``out of danger.''
   Police Cpl. Mario Odullo said at least six men armd with
automatic rifles and revolvers opened fire as Oreta and his guards
were en route in two cars to the Malabon town hall at about 8 a.m.
He said seven bodyguards were killed in the attack and an eighth
was hospitalized in serious condition.
   Odullo said the ambush was at an intersection of narrow streets
flanked by fish farms, and the the killers escaped aboard a van and
a jeep.
   Police suspected the killers were members of a Sparrow Unit
assassination squad of the communist New People's Army.
   Military units are on full alert in anticipation of increased
rebel activity on Tuesday, the 19th anniversary of the founding of
the New People's Army.

   A jubilant Jesse Jackson, fresh from a knockout victory in
Michigan's primary-style caucuses, vowed Sunday his Democratic
presidential campaign would continue to ``win and grow.'' Michael
Dukakis, meanwhile, acknowledged he had suffered a setback, but
told supporters: ``The sweetest honey is made only slowly.''
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, whose third-place finish in Michigan may
have dealt a fatal blow to his Democratic bid, spent Sunday with
his family deciding what his next move would be. If the Missouri
congressman wants to seek re-election to his House seat, he must
file by Tuesday afternoon.
   Gephardt scheduled a Washington news conference Monday afternoon
to announce his plans. Aides, speaking on condition of anonymity,
had already said a loss in Michigan would finish his campaign.
   Jackson asserted that his Michigan showing had put new punch
into an already-powerful campaign.
   ``It was the message of the soul and authenticity of Jesse
Jackson versus money and technology _ and the people prevailed,''
Jackson told supporters at an airport news conference in New York's
Westchester County. ``It's a campaign of hope ... that will
continue to win and grow.''
   But Dukakis said it was too soon to say how the Democratic race
is shaking out.
   ``Anyone that thinks that this race is over or even that it's
narrowed down to a two-person or a three-person race doesn't
understand the unpredictability of American politics,'' said
Dukakis, who had hoped to seal an image of ``inevitablity'' with a
Michigan win. ``There are no front-runners.''
   Jackson ran well across Michigan, but racked up enormous
majorities in Detroit. In one of the city's congressional
districts, Jackson's victory margin was better than 12-1. Overall,
he outpolled Dukakis by a nearly 2-1 margin.
   The civil rights activist quickly turned to the next
battleground, heading for Connecticut, which holds its primary on
Tuesday.
   With returns from 94 percent of the voting sites in Michigan,
Jackson had 107,689 or 55 percent to 55,337 or 28 percent for
Dukakis. Gephardt had 24,995 or 13 percent. Sen. Paul Simon had
4,069 or 2 percent, and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 3,818 or 2 percent.
   When Jackson got word of his Michigan victory, he was already
campaigning in Wisconsin, which holds its primary on April 5. A
statewide poll being published in Monday's Milwaukee Sentinel
suggested Jackson and Dukakis were in a dead heat in the state.
   The poll indicated Dukakis had the backing of 28 percent of
Democratic respondents, while Jackson had 27 percent, and another
22 percent were undecided. Simon had 10 percent, Gephardt 8 percent
and Gore 3 percent. The margin of error in the telephone survey,
conducted March 17-22, was 5 percentage points.
   Dukakis was in Wisconsin when he heard the Michigan results. He
flew home to Boston, then started stumping again in Connecticut.
   ``This is a long race,'' he told backers in New Haven on Sunday
at a Greek celebration. ``We'll have good days and not-so-good
days...but this race is only half over.''
   Dukakis was looking ahead to races like the New York primary on
April 19, with 255 delegates at stake. A poll published Sunday in
the New York Daily News indicated he was the clear favorite,
trailed by Jackson.
   The Daily News poll had Dukakis favored by 45 percent of the
Democrats surveyed, to 29 percent for Jesse Jackson. None of the
three other active Democratic candidates was favored by more than 6
percent of the voters who participated in the survey.
   The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percent.
   The Massachusetts governor won precinct caucuses in North
Dakota, which was just beginning its process of selecting 15
delegates to the national Democratic conventions. And he also was
winning Iowa's county conventions, the latest step in that state's
complicated delegate-selection process.
   But Dukakis has been trying to break away from the rest in the
national delegate count, and Jackson's Michigan victory _ which
netted him a plurality of delegates from the state _ left him hot
on Dukakis' heels.
   In the latest AP delegate count, Dukakis had 603.55 to Jackson's
597.55. Gore had 362.8, Simon 171.5, Gephardt 167 and uncommitted
362.6.
   Gore and Simon did not seriously contest the Michigan caucuses,
staking their hopes instead on the Wisconsin primary.
   Gore was in Connecticut Sunday, suggesting Dukakis'
disappointing finish could help him by keeping the race ``wide
open.''
   ``We're building momentum steadily...we're gaining speed,'' he
said said after a speech at an Italian-American club in the
industrial city of Derby. ``This race has a long way to go. It is
wide open, even more so after the results in Michigan.''
   Simon, stressing his ties to Wisconsin, attended services Sunday
at a church in the tiny community of Zachow, where his late father
was ordained as a Lutheran minister 62 years ago. Simon later
traveled to a site where his grandparents once farmed, then to a
family reunion with some of his cousins.
   Gephardt, who has spent the last two years campaigning, had said
a ``Michigan miracle'' could rejuvenate his campaign, which had a
strong start in Iowa but has since racked up a string of losses.
   ``We haven't decided anything,'' Gephardt said. ``We're going to
go home and have a family meeting.'' On Sunday afternoon, spokesman
Mark Johnson said no decision had been made.
   But signs were pointing to a quick exit. A Missouri state party
leader, state Rep. Anthony D. Ribaudo, said he had spoken with
Gephardt Saturday night, and said Gephardt indicated he would run
for his House seat.
   ``Dick Gephardt has informed me he'd like to proceed with his
career in Congress,'' Ribaudo said.
   Gephardt could file for his House seat, however, and still keep
his presidential campaign alive in some form for the time being.
   Sen. Bob Dole, who has conceded he has little chance of getting
the GOP nomination, had no campaign appearances Sunday. He was
giving a speech on Monday in Washington on the future direction of
the Republican Party.
   Vice President George Bush was in California Sunday, taking a
day off. He planned to spend at least three days campaigning in
Wisconsin this week.
   Pat Robertson, who trails far behind Bush and Dole, had no
campaign appearances scheduled this week.

<HEAD>Mayor-Elect Said He Would Talk With Drug Traffickers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor-elect of Medellin was quoted
as saying Sunday that he would ``search for a dialogue'' with the
notorious cartel in his city that dominates the cocaine trade to
the United States.
   Juan Gomez Martinez, who was elected mayor of Medellin on March
13 and takes office June 1, also was quoted as saying the United
States has become hostile toward Colombia.
   ``Colombia is a poor country where there are no resources for
fighting drug trafficking,'' Gomez said in an interview published
by the Bogota morning daily El Tiempo.
   Last year, the U.S. government gave $14 million aid to Colombia
for fighting drug trafficking. Most of the aid came in the form of
training Colombian security forces.
   Asked if he would meet with the drug traffickers, Gomez was
quoted as saying: ``Dialogue with them has been needed. I would
search for dialogue.
   ``The United States limits itself to criticizing us and
thwarting our trade. I think that they have failed to consider
Colombia as a friendly country,'' Gomez said.
   Gomez, who has controlling interest of the Medellin daily El
Colombiano, has said he will resign as director of the newspaper
when he becomes mayor.
   Medellin, with about 2 million people, is Colombia's
second-largest city. A group of gangsters known as the Medellin
Cartel controls most of the cocaine trafficking to the United
States.
   Earlier this month, gunmen believed to have been hired by drug
traffickers killed Gomez's chief of security. Also this month a
bomb was hurled into the entryway of El Colombiano.
   A guard heaved the bomb into the street, where it exploded,
killing a passerby. In November, gunmen trying to kidnap Gomez shot
up his house.
   El Colombiano had supported government efforts to stop drug
trafficking, including extradition. But asked if the answer was
extraditing Colombians to the United States to face drug charges,
Gomez said, ``I thought so at first, but it has caused so many
problems that it should be examined.''

   A Houston opera company will present
in Scotland ``Nixon in China,'' a contemporary opera about the
former president's visit to communist China in 1972, it was
announced Sunday.
   The Houston Grand Opera Association will present the John Adams
opera at the Edinburgh Festival, an international arts festival
held in August.
   Festival director Frank Dunlop called the Houston company's
scheduled visit a ``fantastic coup'' and said ``Nixon in China'' is
the ``most startling contemporary opera.''
   The opera premiered in Houston last October.
   ``We are delighted to act as a catalyst in rescuing the major
operatic centerpiece to this year's festival,'' said Roger
Ridley-Thomas, managing director of The Scotsman Publications.
   He said The Scotsman daily newspaper would underwrite the
$109,800 required to help bring the Houston company to Edinburgh.
   As late as Friday it appeared there would be no opera at this
year's festival because of a shortage of money. Ridley-Thomas said
directors of The Scotsman felt they had to do something to maintain
Edinburgh's reputation for holding one of the world's most
important international arts festival.

Oliver North's private network three months before the Iran-Contra

   Richard M. Pena, a former House Foreign Affairs Committee staff

materiel from two South American companies. One would sell
grenades, bombs and mines, and the other had boots at $33 a pair,

<HEAD>High Gold Prices Spurring Another Montana Gold Rush</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper once was king in Montana. But the
monarch has been dethroned _ by gold.
   While few would conjure visions of a ``gold rush'' on par with
those of the last century, there's no doubt that gold is fueling
the state's fastest-growing industry.
   ``We are looking at a period of major upswing,'' said Edward
Ruppell, head of the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology. He
expects a healthy amount of mining activity to continue as long as
gold prices remain above $400 an ounce.
   Jim Jensen, executive director of the Montana Environmental
Information Center, believes, ``We've got an old-fashioned gold
rush on our hands.''
   While the state may not be experiencing a flood of major mining
companies, he said hordes of small one- or two-man placer mining
operations are tucked away in the backcountry. ``They're up every
gulch and coulee in the state,'' Jensen said.
   The scope of the mining is hard to measure because, unlike the
once-thriving copper industry centered in Butte's huge open-pit
mines and Anaconda's giant smelter, the search for gold is
scattered out of sight in the hills and mountains.
   ``People don't see in one spot the major impact mining has on
the economy,'' said Gary Langley, executive director of the Montana
Mining Association.
   Montana has four major precious metal mines operating now,
employing about 900 people and producing more than 5 million ounces
of gold and silver annually. Seven more projects in some stage of
planning could more than double both employment and yearly
production.
   Also, exploration is booming. The Department of State Lands,
which reviews all major mining applications, estimates there are
450 exploration projects under way. The agency issued 111
exploration permits last year, twice the number recorded in 1982.
   With so much exploration and so many projects on the drawing
board, ``I don't see that it's going to turn around,'' said Kit
Walther, chief of the department's Hardrock Bureau.
   Of the existing projects, the Pegasus Gold operation at Zortman
and Landusky is the state's largest gold producer and the third
largest supplier of silver. Opened in 1979, it produces 100,000
ounces of gold and 200,000 ounces of silver per year.
   The state's largest underground mine near Troy, operated by
American Smelting and Refining Co. since 1981, is the state's
largest silver producer at 3.6 million ounces annually.
   The Montana Tunnels project south of Helena, started in April
1986 and operated by Pegasus, expects to mine 85,000 ounces of gold
this year. The Golden Sunlight Mine east of Whitehall began in 1982
and produces up to 100,000 ounces of gold per year.
   The Jardine Joint Venture, planned for three miles north of
Yellowstone National Park, received state approval earlier this
year and hopes for full production of 42,000 ounces of gold per
year by mid-1989.
   U.S. Borax and Asarco Inc. have proposed large silver mines in
the Cabinet Mountains of northwestern Montana that together would
produce 11 million ounces of silver per year.
   Langley said many of the mining ventures are centered on the
same claims scoured by miners in Montana's territorial days. New
technology in the use of cyanide makes it easier to separate gold
from rock and more elaborate machinery smoothes the task of moving
14 tons of earth to process one ounce of gold, he said.
   But the lure of gold is not without its problems.
   Jensen said the Department of State Lands does not have the
experienced staff necessary to monitor all the mining projects
properly, especially those exempt from state review because their
plans call for disturbing no more than five acres.
   ``Who knows what these people are doing until some problem
occurs,'' he said.
   Jensen also complains that mining companies take too lightly the
danger of cyanide leaking into rivers and streams, and that the
state department is reluctant to require extensive environmental
impact statements on projects. He also said the state needs
reclamation standards to govern open-pit mines that dominate the
precious metals industry.
   Dennis Hemmer, state lands commissioner, denies his agency shies
away from environmental reviews. And Langley said
environmentalists' opposition to mining projects is based on
admittedly poor mining practices of the past. The industry is more
conscious of the environmental effects of its work than before, he
said.
   But Jensen is suspicious, noting the state has yet to reject a
single mine application.
   ``Maybe there should be a day when the state said, `Here is a
proposal to mine where the risk to other values clearly outweighs
the benefits,''' he said. ``Is mining something that can always go
on and always has the highest value no matter what? I don't think
so.''

   If you don't agree with one oil-price forecast
for the 1990s, just flip the page.
   Projections of per-barrel future prices are ranging from as low
as $12 to as high as $46. With oil markets currently volatile and
uncertain, the future appears anything but clear.
   Some forecasters see a continuing market glut, others see
tightening oil supplies. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is viewed both as on its way back to defining oil prices
and as a fading force.
   Perhaps never before has the crystal ball of oil price
forecasting been so buried in a blizzard of logic, numbers and
ultimately, guesses.
   Since late 1985, prices for West Texas Intermediate Crude _ the
benchmark gauge of U.S. prices _ have fluctuated from below $10 to
above $20. In recent months, the figure has gyrated between $15 and
$20 per 42-gallon barrel.
   Although OPEC members agreed in December to keep the cartel's
official price at $18 per barrel, reports of overproduction and
price discounting by OPEC members have kept the market soft.
   That picture could change dramatically in a few short years,
according to some experts. Chuck Strain, director of energy
research at Lovett, Mitchell, Webb & Garrison Inc. in Houston,
projects that oil prices will rise from current levels to about $27
in 1991, hitting a level that will last, with fluctuations,
throughout much of the decade.
   ``We're basically more optimistic about crude than most other
people,'' Strain said. ``The Kuwaitis and Saudis will regain
control of pricing in 1989-1990.''
   Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are two of the cartel's leading
producers.
   He believes increasing demand for OPEC oil will enable the
cartel to enforce a firmer pricing line due to strong gasoline
appetite and the limited attractiveness of energy alternatives.
   ``The reason we level it off at $27 is that the Saudis will
raise the level of price to where it is below what would encourage
alternate (non-OPEC) forms of energy,'' said Strain, who also
forecasts neither strong growth nor deep economic retrenchment
during the next several years.
   Richard S. Pzena, senior research analyst for Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co., Inc. in New York, believes oil prices will reach
$30 in 1992, rising to $36-$37 in 1995, gauged in 1988 dollars.
   ``In my mind the issue is that the world needs OPEC oil and OPEC
ought to try to charge the highest price it can get away with if it
is being rational, which is the highest it can charge without
losing market share,'' said Pzena.
   ``Prices can probably keep going up to about $30 before you see
a whole new category of (non-OPEC) oil become economic,'' Pzena
said.
   Richard Gordon, director of market research for Petroleum
Finance Co. in Washington, says he anticipates oil prices rising to
$29 to $46 per barrel in 1988 dollars in the first half of the
1990s.
   ``We believe it (the price rise) is going to come in first half
of 1990s, most probably in 1992,'' said Gordon, who says his
research has been based on examination of oil prices over more than
a century.
   He estimates oil prices are subject to economic cycles of
roughly 20 years from peak to peak and trough to trough.
   ``We believe there are fundamental market factors that create
this cycle and make it keep recurring, and those factors are not
related to OPEC, (and) they are not a function of market shock,''
Gordon said. ``They are related to long-term shifts in market
fundamentals in the oil and gas sectors.''
   He believes the oil industry currently is focusing on trying to
gain returns on safe projects, rather than exploring new oil
sources.
   ``The industry has in effect begun a long-term strategic
depletion of its reserves,'' Gordon said.
   But Joseph Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, believes oil prices are unlikely to rise past
$24 per barrel over the next seven years. He even has gone so far
as to say prices could drop as low of $12 per barrel at some point
in the 1990s.
   Stanislaw said in a recent speech that the oil industry should
pay more attention to the individual motives of pivotal
oil-exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, and
less attention to OPEC as a cartel.
   ``Forget OPEC _ I can't emphasize that enough,'' Stanislaw said,
adding that growth in non-OPEC production has diluted OPEC's
influence. ``Every time we look, we find oil.''
   Another price bear is Dale Steffes, founder of Houston-based
Planning & Forecasting Consultants, who believes oil prices in 1995
are unlikely to be any higher than $14, measured in 1988 dollars.
   ``Why somebody thinks we are going to have high prices is beyond
me,'' he said. ``There is too much oil in the world, it's
overpriced and there is not enough demand.''

<HEAD>Arab Oil Expert Says Cooperation Crucial to Price Stability</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Oil Forecasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent Arab oil expert, describing the
present oil market as ``very weak,'' warned Sunday that the failure
of OPEC members to abide by their output quotas could lead to a
collapse of oil prices.
   Abdel-Aziz al-Watari, acting secretary-general of the
Organization of Arab Oil Exporting Countries, said a recent Arab
energy conference held in Baghdad, Iraq, concluded that ``the oil
market is very weak at present because of the absolute slowdown in
oil demand and because projections of increase in demand have
failed to come through.''
   In an interview with the Kuwait News Agency, Watari said this
situation could last for five years. He called for ``a profound
commitment and high degree of credibility on the part of OPEC
states to retain the present reference price of $18 a barrel.''
   The situation, he said, also required ``a high degree of
cooperation'' from producers outside the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. Seven of OAPEC's members, including
influential Saudi Arabia, also are members of OPEC.
   On Friday, crude oil prices firmed slightly in response to
reports that members of OPEC's pricing committee would meet next
month to discuss ways to stabilize the market.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West
Texas Intemediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled at $17.03 per
barrel, up 7 cents from Thursday's close.
   Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer on Wednesday called for an
emergency meeting of the pricing committee amid reports some of the
cartel's members have been violating production quotas and prices
decreed by OPEC.
   ``The failure of states in OPEC to stick to the production
sharing will set the stage for a price decline, and any
extraordinary increase in production could lead to the collapse of
the price system in the foreseeable future,'' Watari warned.
   In Riyadh, Nazer discussed cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC
members with Malaysian Foreign Minister Datu al-Haj Abu al-Hasan
Ibn al-Haj Omar, whose country is not a member of the cartel.
   The official Saudi Press Agency quoted Nazer as saying that
during the meeting, the two ministers ``reviewed the role of
non-OPEC producers in helping stabilize the oil market.''

   Corporate merger specialists, tired of
subsidizing co-worker salaries, quit and create their own company.
One of the country's biggest law firms splinters in a feud over
money and expansion. An advertising giant teeters when executives
join a newly formed rival, wooing valued clients.
   From Madison Avenue to Wall Street, disgruntled managers are
jumping ship with increasing frequency, a trend that reflects their
frustration at working for someone else and fear of getting
victimized in an uncertain climate of corporate takeovers, experts
say.
   ``Companies are going to have to do more to give individuals the
ability to function as entrepreneurs,'' said Frank Palma, senior
vice president of executive search at Goodrich & Sherwood Co., a
management consulting firm. ``If they don't, we'll see more people
venture into their own businesses.''
   To some extent, management analysts say, many talented
executives feel they have a better survival chance if they start
their own companies, rather than remain loyal to employers that
could suddenly become takeover targets.
   ``Instead of being the swallowee, why not do the swallowing?,''
Palma said. ``I just see a change in the perspective of good many
people, because of all the insecure aspects of being a member of
the corporate environment. Going into your own business is not
perceived as such a big risk as it was 20 years ago.''
   Denise Rousseau, associate professor of organizational behavior
at Northwestern University's Kellogg graduate management school,
said the urge to jump ship also is a result of a growing service
economy, in which the products are largely thoughts and ideas.
   ``We just simply have a greater portion of the population in
knowledge- based businesses,'' she said. ``People can more readily
take with them the wherewithal of their work.''
   Some of the most visible departures came after the October stock
market collapse, which shrank Wall Street profits and forced
austerity upon securities firms that had grown fat and complacent.
Many takeover specialists grew annoyed over directives to take
salary cuts, especially when their dealmaking remained one of the
few post-crash moneymakers.
   At First Boston Corp., co-heads of the investment banking unit
quit and formed their own firm. The co-head of Shearson Lehman
Hutton's mergers department quit after a reported clash with the
chief executive.
   Last week, Salomon Brothers Inc. lost one of its celebrities,
former White House budget director David Stockman, who joined the
much smaller Blackstone Group as head of corporate acquisitions. In
addition, Merrill Lynch & Co. and Kidder Peabody & Co. have
suffered defections by some of their brightest stars.
   The splintering also has affected the legal profession, an area
in which up until recently mergers and the growth of super-sized
firms had been common. One of the biggest examples came last year
with the demise of the nation's fourth-biggest law firm: Finley,
Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson & Casey, which
once had 700 attorneys in offices nationwide.
   Greed, excessive expansion, salaries paid with borrowed money
and a management struggle at the top caused lawyers to start
resigning en masse starting last summer, according to press
accounts of Finley Kumble's collapse.
   Another publicized episode of ship-jumping came more recently
when the chairman, president and more than a dozen other key people
at advertising giant Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein Inc. quit to
form a new agency.
   The mass departures stemmed from an autonomy dispute with Lord
Geller's British parent WPP Group PLC. Fearing the exodus would
collapse the firm and send clients over to the new rival, WPP went
to court to sue the defectors.
   This type of litigation, which centers around an area called
intellectual property rights, likely will increase as the number of
employees who quit to form their own companies rises, experts say.
   ``There's a fine line between what is owned by a company and
what is owned by the individual who works for it,'' said Edith
Weiner, a partner at the management consulting firm of Weiner,
Edrich, Brown Inc.
   ``In the service business, we're finding more problems with
intellectual property. It's expanding beyond the issue of taking
clients, into technical knowledge and ideas,'' she said.
   The technological revolution itself has erased some of the
physical impediments of quitting and starting your own company, she
said, particularly because of the vast sources of information
available via computer.
   ``It's very easy to walk out the door. All you have to do is
walk out with it on a (computer) disk,'' she said. ``You used to
have to take file cabinets.''

   Steve Florio talked to his longtime advertising
agency nearly every day, but says he was as surprised as anyone
when Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein Inc. began to unravel 10 days
ago.
   It was a Friday afternoon and Florio, the president and chief
executive of New Yorker Magazine Inc., called to discuss some minor
changes in an ad layout.
   He asked for Arthur Einstein Jr., a founding partner at the
highly regarded agency that has been making New Yorker ads for 17
years.
   Einstein wasn't there. ``His secretary told me Arthur and Dick
Lord had resigned _ that six of them had walked out,'' Florio said.
   The walkout on March 18 was followed by other defections, and
within a week Florio had decided he would drop Lord Geller as his
ad agency. Other clients, including giant International Business
Machines Corp., said they are reassessing the situation, too.
   The events have been the talk of Madison Avenue, where business
and personal relations often seem inextricably bound.
   Einstein said he and his five colleagues left to start a new
agency because they felt they couldn't operate as they wanted to
under the management of WPP Group PLC, which acquired Lord Geller
last summer.
   Since the six top executives left, an estimated 30 of Lord
Geller's 325 employees have quit, some joining their old colleagues
at a new agency called Lord, Einstein, O'Neill & Partners.
   Lord Geller has gone to court, charging that the departed
executives breached fiduciary duties and conspired to take business
from the agency. The firm asks that the defectors be enjoined from
soliciting Lord Geller clients and employees. A state Supreme Court
hearing has been set for Monday.
   WPP, which is headed by the financially-adept Martin Sorrell,
bought Lord Geller as part of its $566 million purchase in July
1987 of JWT Group Inc., which also owned the advertising giant J.
Walter Thompson Co.
   Lord Geller and J. Walter Thompson had been operated
independently since Lord Geller was acquired by Thompson in 1974.
   Einstein said he and his partners grew increasingly disaffected
under WPP's ownership, but Sorrell refused to discuss selling the
agency to them.
   They objected to WPP's reported plans to set up a network of
agencies in Europe that could boast an affiliation with Lord Geller.
   They bristled when Sorrell prohibited Lord Geller from competing
for General Motors Corp.'s new Saturn automobile account,
reportedly for fear of offending Ford Motor Co., J. Walter
Thompson's biggest client.
   The New Yorker's Florio said Einstein had never mentioned that
he and his colleagues were having problems under WPP management.
After being told Einstein had left the agency, Florio said, he
phoned Einstein and told him that he wanted to continue working
with him.
   Sorrell stopped by on Monday to talk with Florio and asked him
to defer a decision on moving the account because two respected
admakers, Dick Thomas and Chuck Griffith, would be staying on it.
   But when Florio called Griffith the next day to discuss the
changes he had in mind for the ad, he was told Griffith ``had left
for good.''
   He asked for Thomas, was switched over and then told Thomas had
``left the agency an hour ago.''
   Florio asked to talk with Sorrell, who told him there were
plenty of talented people at the agency to get the ad done. But
Florio didn't like the idea that you could ``just slap somebody on
the account,'' and told Sorrell to ``freeze my campaign for the
time being.''
   Florio said he was now genuinely worried about the ad deadline,
and called the Lord Geller executive who normally placed the New
Yorker ads. He was told she had left the agency as well.
   ``All the creative people and the media people that I had dealt
with had resigned. I literally don't know anybody there,'' Florio
said.
   On Friday, Florio said he planned to send a letter next week
dismissing the agency and would take the account to Lord Einstein.
   The New Yorker is a relatively small account, spending about
$1.5 million on advertising this year. Lord Geller handles billings
of about $245 million a year, which in turn is dwarfed by the $3.2
billion that Thompson bills.
   The walkout touched off a scramble by other agencies for Lord
Geller's accounts. Florio said he heard from six other agencies in
the past week.
   Jerry Della Femina, who heads Della Femina Travisano & Partners,
is among them. He bets most clients won't move to the new agency
given the legal challenges that Lord Geller has raised.
   Della Femina said some Lord Geller clients may say ``a plague on
both their houses'' and look for a new agency.

<HEAD>Black & Decker Chairman Looking For Next Takeover Target</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bowing out of the fight to take over American
Standard Inc. hasn't left Black & Decker chairman Nolan D.
Archibald on the ropes.
   He's still on the lookout for another good acquisition and won't
rule out another hostile takeover bid. And in the eyes of Wall
Street, walking away from the bidding war may have raised his
standing a notch or two.
   ``We have a list of companies we've been looking at for more
than a year,'' he said in an interview. ``American Standard was at
the top of that list; when another company hits the top we'll go
after it. It could be a week or six months.''
   Archibald wants to make Black & Decker a home-related-products
powerhouse. The plan is to take advantage of the Towson toolmaker's
worldwide distribution network and marketing skills by adding new
products, a process that began with its acquisition of General
Electric's home appliance group.
   ``We don't want to be a conglomerate, but we do want to become a
much bigger company than we are now,'' he said.
   He won't say how big, but taking over American Standard would
have created one of the Baltimore-Washington area's largest
companies, with sales approaching $5 billion.
   He has enlisted the corps d'elite of investment banking Shearson
Lehman Hutton, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and First Boston,
among others to beat the bushes for a suitable match.
   Had the run at American Standard been successful, Archibald
envisioned weaving its strong plumbing and fixtures lines into
Black & Decker's consumer-oriented building product lines. The
merger would have made Black & Decker a key player in the new
housing market and complemented its strong position in professional
power tools.
   Archibald said Black & Decker has its eye on several companies
and added that its next acquisition target could be smaller than
American Standard. It could also be a friendly one.
   ``There are a lot of companies out there up for sale due to past
mergers and spinoffs. A lot of the opportunities we're looking at
fall into that category,'' he said.
   However, a few public companies are also being considered, and
Archibald doesn't rule out the possibility of making another
hostile bid.
   Archibald said he's not chagrined at losing American Standard to
Kelso & Co., which beat out Black & Decker with a $2.5 billion
offer the Towson-based power tool maker wasn't willing to match. He
said there is nothing he would have done differently from a
tactical standpoint.
   ``We could have bought the company, but the bidding got to a
level that wasn't in line with our financial objectives,'' he said.
   Though the Towson manufacturer lost the contest for American
Standard, Archibald walked away from the possibility of overpaying
and diluting near-term profits and pocketed a $25 million payoff
from Kelso _ which looks good to Wall Street.
   ``They played a good, well-orchestrated game, but in the end
decided it wasn't worth risking diluting earnings. Knowing when to
walk away and getting paid for it demonstrates the maturity of this
company's management team,'' said Bentley Offutt, president of
Offutt Securities Inc. in Towson.
   ``People were relieved,'' said Robert O' Grady, a securities
salesman for Alex. Brown & Sons in New York. ``They were loading up
with debt to purchase a $36 stock. Now the company has returned to
what it was two months ago, a beautifully run company with great
earnings potential.''
