<TEXT>
   Joan Kennedy, former wife of U.S. Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, has been scheduled to stand trial Sept. 13 on a
drunken driving charge.
   The trial date was set Thursday after a telephone conference
between her attorney, Patrick Butler of Hyannis, and Assistant
Barnstable County District Attorney Richard Piazza.
   Mrs. Kennedy, 51, has pleaded innocent.
   She was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of
alcohol July 5 in Craigville on Cape Cod after the car she was
driving hit a fence, police said. She escaped injury.
   Mrs. Kennedy refused to take a breath test after the crash,
Piazza said. Refusal to take the test means an automatic 120-day
suspension of her driver's license.
   Mrs. Kennedy was fined $200 and her license suspended for six
months in 1974 after she pleaded guilty to drunken driving in
Virginia.
   Mrs. Kennedy, who joined Alcoholic Anonymous, divorced Kennedy,
D-Mass., in 1983.

   A Cherokee Indian reacted to
reparations paid to Japanese-Americans interned during World War II
by suing the federal government for uprooting his ancestors in the
forced march known as the Trail of Tears.
   ``I've always said if they pay the Japanese, they should pay
us,'' said Woodrow W. Bussey, who filed the lawsuit in U.S.
District Court Friday on his own behalf.
   A day earlier, the U.S. House passed legislation to give $20,000
each to surviving Japanese-Americans who were forced into
internment camps following the attack on Pearl Harbor almost 47
years ago. President Reagan has said he will sign the $1.2 billion
bill.
   Bussey, 71, of Albuquerque, said he is a Cherokee medicine man,
author, artist and inventor. He said he has not yet found a lawyer
to handle the case.
   ``If they pay us what they pay the Japanese, we'll be happy,''
he said in an interview. ``Hell, I think I'd happy if they just
apologized _ if they'd admit that we had rights and they just
didn't treat us right.''
   The lawsuit says ``members of the Cherokee Nation were forcibly
removed from their lands in eastern states and were herded like
animals on what is now nationally known as the Trail of Tears.''
   In the fall of 1838, federal troops gathered tribal members from
North and South Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia and forced them on
a 116-day march across the country to northeast Oklahoma.
   Bussey said he does not oppose the payment to the
Japanese-Americans, but believes Indians are entitled to the same
benefit.
   ``They treated the Japanese a whole lot better than my people,
although it was still a brutal thing to do,'' he said. ``They
trucked them to their new houses, built fences, and fed them.
   ``My aunt told me that they marched the Cherokees across the
country, found the worst place they could and then pointed to a
shady tree and said, `Indian, that's your new home.'''
   Bussey said he expects other tribe members and representatives
of other tribes to join in the lawsuit, which seeks damages of more
than $10,000.
   Wilma Mankiller, principal chief of the Cherokee Nation in
Oklahoma, said Friday she has not seen the lawsuit, but confirmed
that Bussey was a tribe member. She said she would not comment on
the lawsuit until she could review it.

   Authorities seized near the Burmese
border what is believed to be the biggest heroin refining complex
uncovered in Thailand in the past decade, a senior police officer
said today.
   About 50 policemen armed with M-16 automatic rifles exchanged
fire with guards before seizing the complex Friday in the jungle
hills of Chiang Dao district of northern province Chiang Mai
province, said Maj. Gen. Kovit Wattana.
   Kovit, commander of the regional border patrol police, said no
policemen were hurt in the gunbattle, after which the 40 to 50
workers in the complex fled into the jungle. No arrests were made.
   Kovit said the complex contained 13 small refineries and six big
stoves for refining opium. He said police seized about 45 pounds of
heroin, 80 pounds of raw opium and 45 pounds of morphine. Opium is
refined into morphine, which is synthesized into heroin.
   Kovit said authorities were trying to track two hill tribesmen
who operated the complex, about 10 miles from the Burmese frontier.
   The area is part of the ``Golden Triangle,'' where the borders
of Thailand, Laos and Burma converge and which is one of the
world's largest producers of illicit narcotics.

   Secretary of State George Shultz
returns to Central America Monday for the third time in little more
than a month in yet another effort to put a U.S. stamp on a
year-old peace initiative.
   He is not likely to do any better this time.
   Shultz's latest visit comes a year and a day after the
presidents of Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa
Rica signed a peace plan that has done little to end the region's
bloody conflicts.
   It also comes a week after Shultz failed to get a strong
condemnation of Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government from the
other four countries during a meeting with their foreign ministers.
   Costa Rica's foreign minister, Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto, signaled
the reason for Shultz's failure at a news conference following
Monday's meeting in Guatemala City.
   ``The leadership of Central America will not be abandoned, will
not be given up,'' Madrigal said. ``We are very interested in
having the Central American countries retain their leadership in
this entire effort for peace and democracy.''
   Shultz also visited the region in June.
   The peace plan was designed by Costa Rica's president, Oscar
Arias. It earned him last year's Nobel Peace Prize, and he has made
it clear he does not want to see it fall into Washington's hands.
   After several months of relatively little diplomatic activity,
Arias appears to be planning a new initiative of his own.
   In a meeting with foreign reporters Friday, Arias hinted he will
seek Latin American support this week for political and economic
sanctions against Nicaragua for its failure to comply with his plan.
   The plan calls for cease-fires in civil conflicts in Nicaragua,
El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, amnesty decrees in all four
countries, democratization, and the lifting of emergency or martial
laws.
   It also calls for an end to all outside aid to the region's
insurgents and an end to use of any country's territory by those
seeking overthrow of a neighboring nation.
   El Salvador is still gripped by a bloody civil war. A fragile
cease-fire in Nicaragua is broken almost daily, and leftist
insurgencies still trouble Honduras and Guatemala.
   Shultz will meet with Arias upon his arrival here Monday from
Bolivia. The secretary flies Tuesday to Honduras and El Salvador to
meet presidents of those countries, and on Wednesday both he and
Arias go to Ecuador for the inauguration of President-elect Rodrigo
Borja.
   In Ecuador, Arias will discuss a new initiative with the
presidents and foreign ministers of other Latin American nations.
He said if he gets the support he seeks, he may announce a new plan
shortly after his return.
   ``My new initiative is to convince the other democracies that we
must put pressure on the Sandinistas,'' Arias told reporters.
   He refsued to elaborate, but when his peace plan was signed last
year, Arias promised to seek political and economic sanctions
against any nation that failed to comply.
   If Arias succeeds, Shultz will have indirectly achieved a U.S.
goal of isolating Nicaragua politically and economically from the
rest of Central and Latin America. The difference is that an Arias
initiative will not be stamped, ``Made in the USA.''
   Like Shultz, Arias harbors little love for the Sandinistas. But
he differs from the Reagan administration in his belief that the
U.S.-backed right-wing rebels known as Contras are no better.
   A Contra victory in Nicaragua, Arias said Friday, would simply
replace a dictatorship of the left with a tyranny of the right.
   In his last meeting with Shultz in late July, Arias said, he
told the secretary that ``the Sandinistas today are the bad guys.''
   ``They have unmasked themselves,'' he added. ``They were not
really honest when they committed themselves to democratize and to
advance toward a pluralistic society.
   ``If any president of Central America has signed (the plan) ...
and simply tried to deceive the world, or the rest of the Central
American presidents, Arias said, he ``should be punished.''
   But Arias said he remained strongly opposed to further U.S.
military aid to the Contras, who have been trying to topple the
Sandinistas for the past seven years.
   Asked about charges by some U.S. congressmen and administration
officials that he is naive in believing the Sandinistas can be made
to bargain in good faith without a Contra threat, Arias replied:
   ``Was George Shultz naive when he proposed a Middle East peace
plan?''

   The small valve that halted the test
firing of the space shuttle Discovery's main rocket engines was
being removed Saturday to prepare the ship for another try at the
hot-fire test.
   That test could come as early as mid-week, but NASA officials
declined to set a date until the work is completed.
   ``We've got a schedule laid out, we know what we have to do, we
have access to the engine and we're slowly, very carefully, making
our way down to the valve,'' said Kennedy Space Center spokeswoman
Lisa Malone.
   A replacement hydrogen bleed valve, flown from NASA's engine
facility in Mississippi, was on hand.
   According to the schedule, the old valve assembly that closes a
one-inch line was to be out by midnight Sunday. The engine work was
proceeding around the clock with three shifts of mechanics.
   The task was time consuming because a maze of structures, pipes,
wiring and other materials had to be moved out of the way in the
cramped aft section of the orbiter before workers from engine-maker
Rocketdyne could get to the faulty valve.
   When the new valve is installed, all that piping and other
material will have to be put back, panels replaced and work
scaffolding removed.
   The space center told its employees that work is expected to be
completed Tuesday. Whether the firing test could be scheduled for
Wednesday remained to be determined.
   Last Thursday's scheduled test firing was aborted microseconds
before ignition because computers sensed that the hydrogen bleed
valve, on the No. 2 engine, was about one-fourth open. It was
supposed to be nearly closed at that point.
   The valve is used to circulate liquid hydrogen at 423 degrees
below zero Fahrenheit to cool other engine parts before ignition,
but it must be closed when hydrogen pours into the combustion
chamber at the rate of 1,035 gallons a minute during firing.
   ``Engineers determined the valve's position indicator was not
giving the correct information to the engine controller,'' Miss
Malone said, referring to an onboard computer.
   ``The valve was actually closing as it should have been in the
last seconds of the countdown,'' she said, ``but the indicator said
the valve was open more than specifications say it should have been
at that time _ which is just milliseconds prior to engine
ignition.''
   Since the indicator sensor and the valve are in the same
assembly, engineers decided to replace both.

   President Reagan vowed today to block any
effort in Congress to respond to his veto of a $300 billion
Pentagon spending bill, warning against ``an even worse defense
bill as an act of retribution.''
   ``It won't happen; not if I have anything to say about it,'' the
president declared in his weekly radio address, delivered from the
Oval Office.
   Reagan vetoed the military authorization bill on Wednesday,
saying that although it offered more funds than he requested, it
was loaded with requirements that would jeopardize his defense
program and weaken the U.S. posture in arms control talks with the
Soviet Union.
   He repeated these objections in his radio address and said,
``Now that I've vetoed the defense bill, there is talk on Capitol
Hill about producing an even worse defense bill as an act of
political retribution.''
   ``Well, let me ask you: What could be more deplorable than to
use the defense of this nation as a political pawn?'' the president
added.

   Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
called Reagan's veto ``another serious setback to building a
bipartisan consensus regarding America's national security policy.''
   Nunn, in the Democratic response to Reagan's address, said he
had hoped Reagan would place ``national security above partisan
considerations.''
   Nunn accused Reagan of following the advice of Vice President
George Bush's ``political'' team rather than his own defense
secretary and other advisers and Republican members of Congress in
vetoing the bill.
   ``We will continue to work for the enactment of this important
defense bill,'' the Georgia senator said.

   ``As long as I'm president, our nation's defenses, including our
strategic defenses, will remain above partisan politics,'' Reagan
said. ``Congress needs to go back to work to pass a new defense
bill, one that I can sign because it strengthens our negotiating
hand instead of weakening it.''
   ``We may be Republicans or Democrats, but when it comes to a
strongly defended nation, we must all be simply Americans,'' Reagan
said.
   The president repeated his charge that the bill made
``unilateral concessions to the Soviets'' and would have crippled
his space-based ``Star Wars'' or Strategic Defense Initiative
program.
   ``I could not in good conscience have done anything other than
mark that bill `veto' and send it right back,'' he said.

   After a week of answering questions about his
health, Michael Dukakis invited _ or perhaps challenged _ the press
corps that travels with him to a spirited speed walk workout
Saturday.
   As the sun rose on Denver at 6 a.m., Dukakis was walking briskly
around City Park, accompanied by a couple dozen reporters, aides,
photographers and network television cameras.
   Also along was California Sen. Alan Cranston, a serious jogger,
and Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, also a jogger.
   Behind, a group of newspaper reporters less committed to
exercise than the Massachusetts governor and Democratic
presidential nominee rode in a dark, stretch limousine, getting out
occasionally to walk a few paces.
   Dukakis regularly spends 30 to 40 minutes in the morning or
evening taking what he calls a ``power walk,'' a fast-paced walk
carrying hand weights in an exercise he says keeps him in shape.
   ``It's enough to get the heart rate up,'' Dukakis said as he
began.
   Normally he works out only with senior aide Nick Mitropolous.
But on his campaign trip Thursday and Friday Dukakis needled
reporters traveling aboard his jet about their health, at one point
calling them an unhealthy looking bunch.
   And at Laguna Beach, Calif., on Friday, he told a large audience
he was inviting the press on his next workout ``as long as they
bring a doctor's letter'' _ remark that hinted at Dukakis' own
doctor's report released Wednesday to squelch unsubstantiated
rumors he had previously sought psychiatric care.
   No letter was required for the workout, however.
   `We're going to get out there and exercise for about 45 minutes
and see just who's in shape and who isn't,'' Dukakis said.
   He and some of those accompanying him walked _ some jogged _
twice around a paved 1.3 mile course through the park and around a
lake. They made the rounds in 35 minutes.
   He ignored the exhaust fumes from gas-powered golf carts that
moved ahead of him, carrying television camera crews and news
photographers, and from the police car that traveled ahead.
   Dukakis also said he didn't feel the effects of Denver's
mile-high altitude. ``It feels pretty good, actually,'' he said.
   Dukakis talked about landscape architecture and public land
acquisition for a while as he walked with Sam Taylor,
concessionaire at the park.
   Dukakis and Mitropolous were the only ones to carry the hand
weights, and Mitropolous readily gave his up to others who wanted
to give the weights a try.
   Dukakis wore blue shorts and a T-shirt given him by the Atlanta
Boys Clubs when he was in that city for the Democratic convention _
and where Dukakis, given a large-sized shirt in a public
presentation, asked that they given him a medium instead.
   ``He said, `If you give me a medium I'll wear it,''' said press
secretary Dayton Duncan, who made the walk. ``They sent him a dozen
mediums.''

   An Oregon State
University oceanographer piloting a one-man submarine has become
the first person to see the bottom of Crater Lake, the nation's
deepest lake.
   Jack Dymond explored the south-central area of the lake at a
depth of about 1,450 feet in search of hydrothermal vents, or hot
springs, during an eight-hour dive Friday in the one-man
submersible Deep Rover.
   The deepest point in the lake is 1,932 feet, making it the
seventh-deepest lake in the world.
   Dymond's dive, conducted a day earlier than planned, was part of
a three-week exploration of Crater Lake, which is funded by a
$225,000 grant from the National Park Service.
   ``It was very rough terrain down there,'' said Jim Milestone,
natural resource management specialist for the National Park
Service at Crater Lake.
   Crater Lake was formed nearly 6,900 years ago when an a volcano,
Mount Mazama, erupted violently and exhausted its supply of magma
or molten rock, and then collapsed into the empty magma chamber.
   Milestone said Dymond explored a rugged fault, part of a
fracture line that rings the floor of the lake.
   Dymond and colleague Bob Collier, both oceanography professors
at Oregon State University, theorize that hydrothermal vents exist
along the fracture line, feeding the lake with hot water, chemicals
and sediments from a source underground.
   Results of Friday's dive would not be released until Sunday, the
researchers said.
   Milestone said Dymond and Collier decided to take the first deep
dive Friday because they felt comfortable with the submersible
after taking shallow two-hour dives Thursday.
   Collier was to take his turn on the lake floor Saturday,
Milestone said.
   The rough lake floor made it difficult for navigation equipment
to keep track of the 10-foot-long craft, Milestone said.
   The dives are being recorded by cameras mounted on the
submersible, which also has maneuverable, pincerlike arms and
instruments to measure temperatures and other data.

<HEAD>Bentsen Counterattacks GOP On National Defense</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic vice presidential
candidate Lloyd Bentsen counterattacked Republicans on the defense
issue Saturday, accusing them of ``poisoning defense policy with
partisan politics.''
   The Texas senator appeared at a meeting of the American G.I.
Forum, a Hispanic veterans organization, two days after George Bush
told the same group that Michael Dukakis was for ``unilateral
disarmament.'' Bentsen told the group the Republican accusations
missed the mark.
   ``Mike Dukakis supports a strong national defense. I'm strong on
defense. The Democratic party is willing to pay the price to defend
freedom,'' he said.
   ``But,'' he said, ``We won't ever, never wink at corruption in
the Pentagon. And we won't ever, never allow your hard-earned tax
dollars to be used for kick-backs to consultants.''
   The $299.5 billion defense bill vetoed last week by President
Reagan was supported by the Secretary of Defense and the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, Bentsen said.
   When Reagan vetoed it and Bush hailed the action, ``they said
`no' to a strengthened role for the military in stopping drug
traffic. ... They said `no' to a 4.1 percent pay raise for our
service men and women. They said `no' to the biggest defense budget
in history,'' he said.
   ``Unfortunately, They also said `yes' to poisoning defense
policy with partisan politics,'' he said. ``Decisions on national
defense are now being based on the latest political poll at the
White House,'' he said.
   Bentsen received an enthusiastic welcome from the group, but the
400 or so people who listened filled less than half the auditorium.
   Bentsen, himself more conservative than Dukakis on defense and
foreign policy, did not respond specifically to Bush's attacks on
Dukakis' defense positions, including opposition to new nuclear
weapons systems. He also made no mention of the Senate's current
wrangling over aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, which the senator
supports but Dukakis opposes.
   The American G.I. Forum is a 150,000 member organization of
Hispanic veterans formed after World War II, and Bentsen made a
general pitch for support from the Hispanic community.
   ``You will see an administration committed to good jobs at fair
wages _ not just along the East and West coasts, but here in Corpus
Christi, in the Rio Grande Valley ... in the barrios of Los
Angeles,'' he said.
   Hispanics are important in the 1988 election, he said. ``You are
strongest in the states where this election could be decided _ here
in Texas and in California.''
   He poked at Bush's promise to put a Hispanic in his Cabinet.
   ``Hispanic Americans aren't maneuvering for a Cabinet post,'' he
said. ``What they're saying is ... `Don't do us any favors _ just
put is where the action is.'''
   Some in the group had been critical of Dukakis for not
appearing. Bentsen, a native of the Rio Grande valley and a bomber
pilot in World War II who has a long relationship with the group,
tried to deflect that criticism.
   Speaking in Spanish, he said he had asked group president Hector
P. Garcia why the vice presidential candidate was not sufficient.
Garcia told him, he said, ``Oh, Lloyd, you're not important. You're
family.''
   Bentsen received 90 percent of the Hispanic vote in his last
Senate campaign in 1982. In addition to seeking the vice
presidency, Bentsen is on the ballot in Texas for re-election to
the Senate.
   Bentsen's stop in Corpus Christi was part of a one-day campaign
sprint. He was stopping next in Kentucky at a big picnic before
returning to Washington.

   Churches are losing their hold on the
hearts and souls of Americans in part because they're too busy
taking care of their own to reach outsiders, leaders at an
evangelism conference said.
   ``We do almost nothing for the truly `unchurched,''' said the
Rev. Alvin A. Illig, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Paulist
National Catholic Evangelization Association.
   He noted that 44 percent of adult Americans _ 78 million people
_ consider themselves ``unchurched,'' meaning they belong to no
church or attend services only on holidays or for weddings or
funerals, according to a recent Gallup poll.
   That is up from 41 percent, or 61 million, 10 years ago, the
Gallup Organization said.
   Ninety-nine percent of U.S. Catholic parishes consciously choose
not to try to reach the average of 4,000 unchurched people who live
in each parish, Illig said Friday at Congress '88, a national
evangelism conference in this Chicago suburb.
   ``The vast majority of our time, effort and money is spent on
maintaining the faith of the active,'' added Illig, whose
organization is a missionary arm of the church that reaches out to
inactive Catholics and non-Catholics.
   Protestant churches are just as guilty as Catholic churches in
that regard, Illig said.
   Paul Benjamin, director of the Washington, D.C.-based National
Church Growth Research Center, agreed.
   ``American churches are going to have to take a really sharp
look at themselves,'' said Benjamin, a minister in the 1.5-million
member Christian Church movement.
   ``There's a tendency in the church to go along with business as
usual. What these people want is a congregation that has warmth and
... a biblical emphasis,'' he said.
   ``I think churches are going to have to tone down their blatant
fundraising and realize that people are more important than
things,'' Benjamin added.
   Sometimes churches are put off by the challenge of reaching
potential members, Illig said.
   ``That's a community of people that is often non-responsive, and
it's an enormous amount of work with very little results, and at
times it can be very discouraging,'' he said.
   But it can make all the difference, said the Rev. William J.
Carl III, pastor at First Presbyterian Church in Dallas.
   In the 1970s, he said, his church made a pivotal decision not to
follow affluent members to the suburbs, and to start caring for the
homeless and hungry on its doorstep.
   ``The press picked it up, and we got a flood of volunteers and
money,'' said Carl, whose 1,850-member church now boasts $1.1
million in annual pledges, almost double the $600,000 low reached
during its transition period.
   ``We have served 800,000 meals in the last 13 years,'' Carl said.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to
President Reagan's radio address Saturday, given by Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga:
   Good afternoon.
   America's defense and foreign policy can only be successful when
it is supported by a bipartisan consensus in the Congress. We are
reminded of this truth by the withdrawal of Soviet forces from
Afghanistan and the recent ratification of the Intermediate Nuclear
Forces Treaty.
   These achievements were not merely coincidences. The courageous
Afghan resistance to Soviet invaders was supported by two
presidents and by a strong bipartisan consensus in the Congress.
The important steps leading to the INF Treaty were started by the
Carter administration and pursued with determination by the Reagan
administration, with consistent support from Republicans and
Democrats in Congress.
   On the other hand, disarray in our defense and foreign policy
has usually been the product of a divided Congress and a divided
America, and can often be traced to irresponsible positions taken
during presidential campaigns. Our nation's failure to deploy a
survivable land-based missile, as well as the delays and costly
mistakes made in deploying a new penetrating bomber, and especially
our inconsistent and unsuccessful policy in Central America, are
vivid examples.
   This week, President Reagan's veto of the National Defense
Authorization Bill represents another serious setback to building a
bipartisan consensus regarding America's national security policy.
   Although Vice President Bush clearly was anxious to toss
national defense into the political arena, I had hoped that
President Reagan would place national security above partisan
considerations.
   I had hoped that President Reagan would listen to those who
urged him not to veto this important bill, including his secretary
of defense, his national security adviser, and key Republican
members of Congress who are experts on national defense, like Sen.
John Warner, Sen. Strom Thurmond, Sen. Ted Stevens, Sen. Bill Cohen
and Sen. Jake Garn. Unfortunately the president followed the advice
not of his national security team, but rather of Vice President
Bush's political team. He made this decision without consulting a
single Democrat in the Congress.
   We will continue to work for the enactment of this important
defense bill, but it will not be easy to put Humpty-Dumpty back
together again. Congress must be clearly told who speaks for the
president on national security matters. I am confident that we can
develop a bill that is acceptable to President Reagan's secretary
of defense and his national security adviser, but I do not believe
we can reach agreement with the vice president's political pollster
and his campaign manager.
   The challenge before us, however, is much broader than simply
getting this important bill enacted.
   If we are to safeguard our nation's security, we must insist on
clarity and common sense in our security strategy; tough-minded
management of the Pentagon; measures to reduce the risk of war; a
greater sharing of the burden of defense by our allies; and a
foreign policy grounded in respect for our Constitution and our
basic values.
   The next president must appoint experienced, capable managers
who will insist on getting our money's worth _ every defense dollar
spent. It takes more than a cash register to run an efficient and
effective Pentagon. And it takes more than an adding machine to
formulate a sound strategy and to set realistic priorities.
   In recent years too many tax dollars have been wasted because we
have produced too many procurement scandals and too few effective
weapons.
   We must also call for a new relationship with our allies, to
achieve a more equitable sharing of defense tasks and to improve
our common defense through sensible specialization.
   Finally, we must recognize that America's power rests not on
military might alone, but on a competitive economy; a solvent
government; an educated people; and, above all, on the democratic
principles that we exemplify to the world.
   As the campaign heats up and the political rhetoric inevitably
increases, I hope that we will remember that our national security
is too important to be the hostage of partisan politics. The late
Sen. Scoop Jackson said it best when he said, ``In matters of
national security, the best politics is no politics.''
   Thank you, and have a nice weekend.

   A Boeing 747 slid off the end of a
flooded runway while landing Saturday, and officials said three
people were injured. Passengers said up to 20 people were hurt.
   People on the Pakistan Airlines jet said the injuries occurred
when emergency exit chutes didn't reach the runway and passengers
fell to the ground.
   Tariq Saeed, president of the Pakistan Federation of Chambers
and Industry, was on the flight from Islamabad, the capital, to
Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. ``When the aircraft overshot the
runway, we feared the plane might catch fire. There was panic when
the cabin crew asked us to leave the aircraft through the emergency
exits,'' he said.
   Saeed said one passenger suffered fractures when he came flying
out of the short emergency chute and landed on the runway.
   An airline spokesman said heavy rains had flooded parts of the
runway, causing the jumbo jet to hydroplane.
   It wasn't known how many people were on the flight. A Boeing 747
can carry more than 400 people.

   Bells rang out across Hiroshima on
Saturday in memory of 78,000 people killed instantly in the world's
first atomic bomb attack 43 years ago.
   In a ceremony attended by 50,000 people, black-clad mourners
placed wreaths on a black granite cenotaph which contains the names
of bomb victims on pieces of paper. They ladled water over the
cenotaph in a common Buddhist practice showing concern for the
deceased.
   Many of the bomb victims cried out for water as they died of
severe burns.
   The cenotaph is in Peace Park, across the Motoyasugawa river
from the bombed-out dome of Hiroshima's former industrial promotion
center, left as a symbol of the bomb's fury.
   It also contains the names of all Hiroshima survivors who have
since died. Officials on Saturday added the names of 4,476
survivors who died during the past year, raising the total to
152,650.
   Bells rang out at 8:15 a.m., the instant the United States
dropped the bomb on Aug. 6, 1945. The uranium bomb, which had the
power of 20,000 tons of TNT, exploded at a height of 1,915 feet
almost directly over the promotion center.
   Three days later, a second bomb was dropped over the city of
Nagasaki, leading to the surrender of Japan's military-controlled
government and the end of World War II.
   ``As the only country to experience the calamity of nuclear
weapons, the tragedy of Hiroshima must never be repeated,'' said
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita in a statement read at Saturday's
ceremony.
   Takeshita, who was unable to attend because of a tax reform
debate in Japan's parliament, vowed that under his administration
Japan will not manufacture, acquire or allow nuclear weapons into
the country.
   Hiroshima Mayor Takeshi Araki repeated the city's motto of ``No
More Hiroshimas'' and said worldwide public opinion now favors
nuclear disarmament.
   He praised the recent nuclear arms agreement signed by the
United States and Soviet Union as ``a worthwhile historical first
step'' but said it left too many nuclear weapons in world arsenals.
   He also criticized the United Nations for refusing to adopt a
resolution calling for comprehensive global disarmament.
   A coalition of peace groups issued a statement criticizing Japan
for its role in the war and accusing the city's atom bomb museum of
neglecting Koreans who were living in Hiroshima and died in the
blast.
   The group, called the Liaison Committee on the War of
Aggression, said the museum refused to exhibit facts about the
city's military buildup prior to the bombing.
   Japan has come under sharp criticism from its Asian neighbors
for deleting or altering references to its World War II military
actions from school textbooks.
   In Seoul, South Korea, about 300 Korean survivors of the bombing
attended a memorial service. They said they had been ignored and
called for compensation for their injuries from the United States,
Japan and South Korea, news reports said.
   Many bomb victims stayed away from ceremonies, preferring to
mark the occasion in private.
   Dr. Itsuzo Shigematsu, chairman of the Radiation Effects
Research Foundation, said many victims don't want to remember the
day the bomb was dropped because it is too painful.
   After nightfall, relatives of people killed in the blast wrote
the names of victims on paper floats, then sent the floats down the
city's river.

<HEAD>Reagan, Democrats Trade Charges of Politics on Defense Spending
Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   President Reagan appealed for bipartisan
support of his military spending programs Saturday and charged
Congress with trying to ``handcuff the president in our arms
reduction negotiations with the Soviets.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee,however, charged that Reagan followed political rather
than national security advice in his decision to veto the Pentagon
spending bill Congress sent him.
   In his weekly radio address, delivered from the Oval Office,
Reagan said his conscience required him to veto the $300 billion
measure.
   ``Now that I've vetoed the defense bill, there is talk on
Capitol Hill about producing an even worse defense bill as an act
of political retribution,'' he said.
   ``Well, let me ask you: What could be more deplorable than to
use the defense of this nation as a political pawn? It won't
happen. Not if I have anything to say about it.''
   ``As long as I am president, our nation's defenses, including
our strategic defenses, will remain above partisan politics,'' the
president said.
   Nunn, in the Democratic response to the president's address,
noted that Vice President George Bush, the prospective Republican
presidential nominee, had urged the president to veto the bill,
while Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci and others urged him
to sign it.
   ``Although Vice President Bush clearly was anxious to toss
national defense into the political arena, I had hoped that
President Reagan would place national security above partisan
considerations,'' the senator said.
   ``Unfortunately the president followed the advice not of his
national security team, but rather of Vice President Bush's
political team. He made this decision without consulting a single
Democrat in the Congress.''
   Nunn said Democrats will continue work on a Defense spending
bill, ``but it will not be easy to put Humpty-Dumpty back together
again.''
   ``I am confident that we can develop a bill that is acceptable
to President Reagan's secretary of defense and his national
security adviser, but I do not believe we can reach agreement with
the vice president's political pollster and his campaign manager,''
he said.
   Reagan said, ``Congress needs to go back to work to pass a new
defense bill, one that I can sign because it strengthens our
negotiating hand instead of weakening it.''
   ``We may be Republicans or Democrats, but when it comes to a
strongly defended nation we must all be simply Americans,'' said
the president.
   ``The bill represents an attempt by Congress to handcuff the
president in our arms reduction negotiations with the Soviets and
this kind of unilateral concession to the Soviets could set back
all the progress we have made on the arms reduction front,'' he
said.
   In vetoing the bill Wednesday, Reagan conceded that it offered
more funds than he requested, but said it was loaded with
requirements that would jeopardize his defense program and weaken
U.S. posture in arms control talks with the Soviet Union.
   Specifically he said, and repeated in his radio address, that
among other things the bill would have crippled his space-based
``Star Wars'' or Strategic Defense Initiative program.
   ``I could not in good conscience have done anything other than
mark that bill veto and send it right back,'' he said.

   Two brothers who told police marijuana
plants were growing behind their house said they turned their
parents in because they didn't want their 15-month-old sister ``to
grow up with that.''
   ``I just told (police) we had witnessed marijuana plants growing
in a shed,'' said Timothy Gustafs, 11.
   ``We were a little scared because we didn't know what was going
to happen,'' added his brother, Christopher, 9.
   Their mother, Cathleen Joyce Smith, 28, and stepfather, Leo
David Smith, 29, were charged with possession and cultivation of
marijuana, said Lt. Don Nettles, head of the Titusville Police
Department's narcotics division.
   The Smiths were taken to jail Thursday and later released on
bond. The boys and their 7-year-old sister went to stay with their
father in Massachusetts, while the Smith's baby remained at home.
   Timothy said he and his brother learned what marijuana smells
and looks like in science class.
   When they saw about 15 plants in the shed Thursday, the boys
picked some leaves and put them in an empty bread bag to show
police. Their parents were at work.
   The boys and a 13-year-old friend rode their bicycles to a
nearby grocery store and called police.
   The boys told officers they had seen their mother and stepfather
smoking marijuana twice and often could smell the smoke in the
house, Nettles said.
   Police took the children's statements at the station, then drove
the kids back to their neighborhood. One of the boys told the baby
sitter what had happened, Nettles said, and she called their mother
at work.
   Officers obtained a search warrant and confiscated the plants,
some of which were 4 feet tall.

<TEXT>
   More than two months before the USS
Vincennes mistakenly shot down an Iranian jetliner, confusing radar
signals caused three other American warships to believe they were
under attack by non-existent Iranian missiles.
   Possibly because no casualties occurred, neither the mix-up
during an April 18 skirmish between U.S. and Iranian forces nor a
subsequent investigation by the U.S. Central Command headquarters
attracted much public attention at the time.
   But for the U.S. Navy, the incident raised some of the same
questions that officials have confronted in the Vincennes tragedy _
whether commanders can depend on information fed to them in a
fast-changing combat situation where they must make split-second
decisions.
   Pentagon sources say a report to be issued this month finds
``human error'' in the heat of combat caused Vincennes' radar
operators to think the Iran Air A-300 Airbus was an attacking
fighter.
   All 290 aboard died when the plane was shot down July 3 over the
Persian Gulf.
   The April 18 incident occurred during a one-day mini-war that
flared in the southern gulf after the United States attacked three
Iranian oil platforms in reprisal for the sowing of mines by Iran.
   During the fighting, in which six Iranian naval craft were sunk
or disabled, radar operators aboard the U.S. missile frigate Jack
Williams picked up signals indicating that Chinese-made Silkworm
anti-ship missiles were being fired from the Iranian coast in the
Strait of Hormuz.
   The ships, which included the destroyer O'Brien and the missile
destroyer Joseph Strauss, took evasive action and launched chaff to
confuse the missiles' guidance systems.
   The Jack Willliams' skipper, Cmdr. Edward Mann, and Capt. Donald
A. Dyer, who was commanding the three-ship group, told a
five-member Pentagon news pool aboard the frigate that four
Silkworms were fired over a span of about an hour.
   The officers were incredulous when top Pentagon officials later
that day said that no Silkworms had been fired.
   In a news conference here June 3, the chief of Central Command,
Gen. George B. Crist, said a subsequent analysis by electronic
warfare experts found no hostile missiles were fired and the radar
operators had misread tracks of those fired by U.S. ships and
planes.
   ``What you got was a number of missiles outgoing, a number of
laser-guided bombs and missiles coming in from (U.S.) aircraft ...
hits on the system as they picked up seekers and missiles moving
through the air,'' said Crist.
   He said ship commanders had reacted properly because ``had they
been missiles incoming, and they didn't take the necessary actions,
they would have been in trouble.''
   In response to queries from The Associated Press, spokesmen for
the Tampa, Florida-based Central Command said an investigation of
the April 18 mix-up found ``no evidence of human error, inadequate
training or equipment malfunction.''
   They conceded that the same thing could happen again in similar
circumstances but said the report did not make any specific
recommendations for change.
   ``What you had was a combat scenario, which is always
characterized by confusion ... such a scenario could be duplicated
again, in the gulf or anywhere in the world,'' said Maj. Barry
Willey.
   ``We are changing procedures constantly on the basis of what's
learned. All the forces take a close look after something like
that,'' he said.
   Some officers have compared the situation to that faced by
Vincennes' skipper, Capt. Will C. Rogers III, who has said he would
respond the same way if given the same data again.
   ``The best decisions always depend on the flow of information
getting to the top,'' says Capt. Alex G. Balian, commander of the
amphibious assault ship Dubuque.
   Some gulf-based Navy officers say the radar operators might have
misread the Silkworm blips because they were unfamiliar. ``Don't
forget, Iran has never fired one in the Hormuz,'' said one.
   Although the Jack Williams' radar is nowhere near as
sophisticated as the Vincennes' Aegis system, both investigations
relied heavily on analysis of tapes from ships' computers. The
Vincennes probers also interviewed many participants and took sworn
testimony.
   It was not known whether the earlier inquiry dealt with the fact
that a U.S. Navy helicopter had to dodge a missile fired by the
Jack Williams, or with eyewitnesses' claims of seeing one Silkworm
cross behind the frigate and hit a distant oil platform.

   President Reagan is preparing to sign
legislation to curb U.S. trade deficits with most of its tough
enforcement features long gone, most of its benefits for key
industries still intact and almost everybody happy with the end
product.
   ``America is starting back,'' Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd
declared Wednesday as the Senate gave 85-11 approval to the measure
and sped it toward Reagan's desk and a guaranteed signature.
   Bandwagon rhetoric swept the Senate, leaving in the dust a
handful of critics bold enough to find flaws in the 1,000-page
measure, some of whom grudgingly voted for the bill.
   ``Unfortunately, the bill is still wrongheaded,'' declared Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who voted for it nevertheless.
   He proclaimed himself torn between what he regards as a
lingering aura of protectionism and a provision that would repeal
the 1980 windfall profits tax. He is a critic of both protectionism
and the tax on oil industry earnings.
   For a while, he said, he thought about cheering loudly for the
bill and voting quietly against it. ``On the other hand, I would
have to admit that there would be a little hypocrisy in that,''
Gramm added.
   He ended up voting for the measure, ``but I do not want anybody
to be confused that somehow I think this is a good bill.''
   As measured by the overwhelming majority of lawmakers, what
protectionist features were once part of the bill are long gone.
   Major provisions would streamline machinery under which the
government imposes tariffs and quotas on imports to protect U.S.
industries being damaged by imports and retaliate against
international trade violations.
   But authority to take such steps already exists. New provisions
would require industries benefiting from import restraints to show
that they could become competitive and thus could actually make
such protection harder to get.
   No intense debate has focused on these provisions for months.
   For many lawmakers in both houses, the key was repeal of the
windfall profits tax. It has not produced revenues since oil prices
plunged in 1985. But it continues to be hated in Texas and other
oil-producing states.
   And if concerted efforts by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries succeeded in raising oil prices, the tax would
generate revenue once again. It also could be much harder to repeal
if budget makers were counting on it to help them meet fiscal
targets under the Gramm-Rudman law.
   Farm lawmakers were once among the quickest to view any trade
legislation as restrictive and thus likely to trigger retaliation
against American exports by Asian nations that buy large amounts of
U.S. grain.
   Indeed, Japan remains the American farmer's top customer with
more than $5 billion a year in agricultural purchases from the
United States.
   But farm lawmakers were brought on board with a potentially
lavish outlay of subsidy dollars for agricultural exporters and
farmers themselves.
   The Export Enhancement Program, established under the 1985 farm
act, would get a new lease on life with a $2.5 billion
authorization. It pays exporters with government surplus crops to
ship American farm goods overseas and has been an increasingly
important part of the trade equation.
   Meanwhile, $500 million would be authorized for advertising and
promotional activities on behalf of U.S. farm products in foreign
markets.
   Wheat, feed grains and soybean growers could become eligible for
marketing loans under the bill. These are sizeable export subsidies
that would be ``triggered'' if negotiators failed to make progress
in the Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations now in
progress.
   It was the need for authority to conclude such deals in the
Uruguay Round that was the Reagan administration's major reason for
reversing course and seeking a trade bill after three years of
throwing cold water on the need for such legislation.
   The negotiations _ named for a kickoff meeting held in Uruguay
but taking place in Geneva _ have two more years to run and U.S.
participants view having the authority as necessary to make
progress.
   Reagan had largely ignored earlier attempts by Congress to force
him to accept a trade bill by threatening to withhold negotiating
authority. Trade officials, however, said the administration
concluded that it was time to get the authority.
   The massive bill is most often described as aimed at curbing
U.S. trade deficits, although it has many purposes.
   Actually, U.S. trade deficits have been coming down fairly
steadily for the last eight months. The red ink was a record $170.3
billion last year. It was $69.3 billion for the first five months
of 1987 and $58.6 billion for the same period this year.
   On a monthly basis, the trade deficit peaked at $15.5 billion in
October. Since then it has fluctuated but the trend has been
steadily down. It was below $11 billion in both April and May, the
most recent figures available.
   The administration primarily credits a steady, downward march of
the dollar, which it engineered, starting in September 1985. At the
same time, it announced a crackdown on unfair practices by U.S.
trading partners.
   Threats of retaliation against such practices have been made in
a number of cases and the more energetic approach appears to have
registered with some lawmakers. But retaliation has come in only
two cases.
   Tariffs on Japanese electronics were raised in retaliation
against dumping, or selling at prices slashed below the cost of
production, of computer chips. Duties also went up on European
pasta in retaliation for Common Market restrictions on U.S. citrus
goods.

   The low hum of voices is continuous,
punctuated by ringing telephones and the crackling of a short-wave
radio at the Boise Interagency Fire Center, the nation's command
post for the war on wildfires.
   The operation is described as ``organized chaos'' by Fire Center
spokesman Arnold Hartigan, partly because this year's dry weather
means it is staffed around the clock at a time of year when it
normally would operate only in the daytime.
   Beginning with the spring fire season in the South and peaking
with roaring fires of late summer in the West, a staff of around 20
per shift _ depending on the number and severity of fires _ routes
everything from toilet paper to bulldozers to create the small
towns that mushroom around base camps at major fires.
   About 8,800 firefighters are battling the worst of some 200
blazes in the West and Alaska, 16 of them considered major fires.
Nearly a third of the manpower is in Yellowstone National Park,
where fires have charred 140,000 acres.
   Six major fires were still burning in Yellowstone. On Saturday,
a 29,240-acre fire situated mostly in the Bridger-Teton National
Forest had charred about 6,400 acres inside the remote southeastern
section of Yellowstone.
   Along with the firefighters themselves, manpower for food
service, public information, law enforcement and heliport
operations is pulled from every corner of the nation.
   ``We have to put this foamer out over Old Faithful today if it's
going to do what it's supposed to,'' Jonel Wagoner tells her
supervisor on the supply desk at the command center. He quickly
gets on another phone to find the retardant.
   Another phone rings. A fire manager needs special couplings for
his equipment as soon as possible.
   ``We can throw 'em on the BIFC truck heading that way,'' Rick
Squires assures him.
   Three control desks in the logistics center are covered with
color-coded requisition orders _ blue for helicopters, orange for
air tankers, green for manpower, red for equipment. Specialists
check computer terminals to locate resources needed on the fireline
in some remote mountainous area.
   The logistics center keeps shuffling crews in and out of
hotspots as fire bosses manage to contain one blaze in Washington
only to have a dry lightning storm or a careless smoker spark new
ones in Idaho or Wyoming.
   Just a few days ago, a fire blazed in the Boise Foothills
outside the center's windows.
   The pavement outside the center's huge warehouse is cluttered
with boxes and equipment, especially at night, when trucks and
cargo planes are loaded to fill requisitions while fire crews use
the cool dark hours to get some rest.
   In just the past month, the center has moved the bulk of the 1.2
million pounds of goods and equipment it has handled so far this
year _ resources worth more than $8 million.
   The force on the line now amounts to just over a third of the
nation's primary firefighting army, but the driest, hottest part of
the summer still is ahead. To date, the center's biggest push has
been the mobilization of 25 20-man crews in a single day.
   ``We're getting more fires because it's so dry,'' Hartigan said.
``The number of fires is up 50 percent from last year, but it's a
question of what's burned so far.''
   In 1985, the worst fire season in decades with 2.9 million acres
burned, some 1,400 structures were lost to forest and brush fires.
This year the number of structures lost can still be counted in the
dozens.
   But nearly 2.4 million acres have burned this year, and while
over half of that has been in remote, roadless terrain in Alaska,
the total has already exceeded fire acreage for all of 1987. Land
managers fear it will exceed the acreage burned in 1985.

   Thirteen passengers and an Amtrak employee
remained hospitalized Saturday after a 12-car train derailment that
was blamed on tracks warped by near-100-degree heat.
   The train, en route from Chicago to Seattle, was traveling at 79
mph when it derailed Friday, toppling at least five of nine
passenger cars and throwing passengers from their seats, leaving
165 injured, authorities said.
   Hospitals treated and released 149 passengers, said Sue Martin,
an Amtrak spokeswoman in Washington, D.C.
   The train was carrying about 375 passengers and a crew of 10 to
15, Amtrak officials said.
   The engineer said the derailment was caused by deformed rails
near this northern Montana farming community.
   A secondary track near the derailment site was cleared late
Friday, allowing rail traffic to go through, Martin said. Crews
planned to spend the weekend repairing the twisted track.
   Amtrak made arrangements Saturday to get passengers to their
destinations.
   About 85 passengers left nearby Glasgow, Mont., on a bus for
Spokane, Wash., and other passengers planned to fly to their
destinations, Martin said.
   ``It's sort of a difficult situation because the airport at
Glasgow is not a commercial airport,'' she said. ``It's an old
Stragetic Air Command facility that's normally used for test
flights. So it's a matter of getting things prepared for flights in
and out of there. We've been working throughout the night with a
charter company and airport officials to find out exactly what kind
of aircraft we can use out of there.''
   Some passengers decided to remain in Glasgow and take a
westbound train Saturday, Martin said.
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board and
Burlington Northern Railroad, which owns the track, were due
Saturday, Martin said.
   Assistant conductor Dennis Cotton said the cars hardest hit by
the derailment were the dining car, the dorm and sleeper coaches.
   ``The first thing that happened was a brief jerk, a slowdown and
people in the aisles went sailing by,'' said Jim Matuska, a
passenger from Girard, Ill. ``The car was beginning to tilt. I was
pretty sure we were going to go down but I didn't have the presence
of mind to do anything. I was out of control. I went flying in the
opposite direction.''

   A gynecologist accused of incompetence in
one patient's death and of drugging and sexually assaulting another
has been barred from practicing medicine.
   Dr. Jeffrey Goldenberg, 41, surrendered his license Friday to
state Department of Professional Regulation officials, who said in
a written emergency suspension order that Goldenberg presented an
``immediate and serious danger'' to the public.
   The department accused Goldenberg of stitching up the abdomen of
a woman on whom he performed a Caesarean section despite heavy
internal bleeding. Goldenberg also botched his attempt to treat the
woman after she suffered cardiac arrest, the department charged.
The woman died after the operation.
   The department's case includes allegations that he performed at
least seven unnecessary Caesarean sections and fondled a patient
during an examination.
   In a separate case, the agency also has accused Goldenberg of
injecting a patient with sedatives and then sexually assaulting
her, said Bruce Lamb, the agency's chief medical attorney. Lamb
said the agency has asked that the state Board of Medicine revoke
Goldenberg's license.
   Goldenberg has refused to comment on the allegations.
   No criminal charges have been filed against Goldenberg.
   Goldenberg, 41, may ask that a state hearing officer review the
allegations at a formal hearing. He also may appeal his suspension
in district court.

<HEAD>IRA Claims Bomb Attack, Calls Thatcher's Comments ``Spur''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility
Saturday for a bomb attack on a British army barracks in West
Germany and said Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's condemnation of
the IRA was spurring its guerrilla war.
   Three soldiers and a civilian suffered cuts and bruises Friday
when a bomb ripped part of the roof off the Roy Barracks in
Duesseldorf, West Germany.
   The bombing raised to 37 the number of British security
personnel injured since Monday in IRA attacks in Northern Ireland,
England and continental Europe.
   Six people have been killed since Monday in the IRA's stepped-up
campaign to drive the British out of the predominantly Protestant
province and unite it with the Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
   Mrs. Thatcher on Saturday called the IRA ``enemies of freedom
and enemies of justice.'' She spoke to reporters during a brief
stop in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, en route to Thailand for a visit.
   ``One is always disturbed when there are any bombings, violence,
killings and maiming of any kind,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   ``I can only make it perfectly clear to all peoples of the world
over that this is contrary to democracy everywhere in the world.
These people (the IRA) have no respect for democracy,'' she said.
   In Australia on Friday, Mrs. Thatcher said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. interview that IRA guerrillas ``should be wiped
off the civilized world.''
   The IRA made its claim in a statement distributed to news media.
In the same statement, it said that ``the type of hypocritical
comments made by Mrs. Thatcher in Malaysia and in Australia are
only a spur to our volunteers to maintain the armed struggle.''
   Thatcher also said her government has not considered
reintroducing internment without trial for IRA suspects, as urged
by police and Protestant lawmakers in Northern Ireland. Internment
was abandoned in 1975 amid world criticism.
   Several hundred IRA sympathizers marked the 17th anniversary of
the introduction of internment Saturday by marching about three
miles through north London.
   Police arrested 30 people on charges of disturbing the public
order in a confrontation with a group of about 20
counter-demonstrators.
   Dozens of police officers and several riot vans accompanied the
demonstration.
   The march was condemned as ``obnoxious and nauseating'' by
Conservative lawmaker John Gorst, whose parliamentary consituency
includes the Inglis Barracks in London. One soldier died there
Monday in an IRA attack.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, the British Cabinet
minister responsible for the province, summoned his top security
advisers to a meeting in Belfast on Friday to discuss the wave of
violence.
   Press Association, the domestic British news agency, said
security was ordered tightened at British military bases and
embassies around the world.

   A passenger train rammed into a barrier at the end
of the line in Paris' Gare de L'Est station Saturday, killing one
person, injuring 57 and trapping some victims for more than two
hours, authorities said.
   It was the second major train crash in Paris in six weeks.
   Rescue workers used electric saws, hammers, pliers and cutters
to extract those caught in the wreckage. Doctors standing by
administered local anesthetics.
   Raoul Vigier, a spokesman for the Paris fire department, said
nine victims were in serious condition. He said all nine spent 2{
hours trapped in the wreckage before rescue workers could free them.
   The fatality was identified only as a man in his 30s who was
dead when rescuers reached him in the wreckage.
   There was no information on how many people were on the train.
   The four-car train arrived at the station at 1:10 p.m. from
Chateau Thierry, 60 miles northeast of Paris. A railroad employee
who saw the accident from about a dozen yards away said the train
appeared to be traveling about 12 mph.
   The first car slammed into the retaining barrier at the end of
the line, pushing up over top of it and twisting at a right angle.
All of the seriously injured were in the first car. The other three
cars and the engine, which was in the rear, remained on the rails.
   ``I saw, in the last 10 meters, that it was not going to stop,''
said the employee, who did not want to be identified. ``I watched
it. There was a big shock, then a flash caused by the overhead
electrical contact wire.
   ``In one second, I saw the train climb, then straddle the
terminal buffer. There was a moment of panic. The shock blew out
the windows of the car.''
   Vigier said most of the injured suffered cuts, bruises, broke
bones and shock.
   The cause of the accident was not known. Two investigations were
launched _ a judicial inquiry and an internal investigation by the
state-run railroad's experts. Railroad officials refused to
speculate on the cause, but employees at the scene said some sort
of brake failure appeared to be the cause.
   On June 27, a passenger train lost its brakes and crashed at
about 45 mph into another train in Paris' Gare de Lyon station.
Fifty-six people died.
   The driver in Saturday's crash was working in the small cabin at
the front of the train but escaped serious injury. He was in a
state of shock as he answered questions from railroad
investigators, officials said.
   The fire department sent more than 100 rescue workers to the
scene. They began giving immediate first aid and working to cut the
trapped passengers out of the car.
   Torn seats could be seen through the windows. Firefighters used
ladders to climb through the windows to reach the injured.
   Railroad officials said there had been no incidents in the run
between Chateau Thierry and Paris that led employees to suspect
there were any problems with the train.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Reagan's weekly
radio address, given from the White House Oval Office:
   My fellow Americans, on Wednesday of this past week I took a
dramatic step, one that I must admit gave me no pleasure.
   I vetoed the defense authorization bill. As it stood, the
defense bill that Congress sent me would have made unilateral
concessions to the Soviets at the very moment when we're trying to
achieve a strategic arms reduction treaty. I could not, in good
conscience, have done anything other than mark that bill ``veto''
and send it right back.
   Permit me to discuss with you for a moment just what's at stake
in this whole matter of the defense bill, and in doing so, it's
important to begin with some historical background. You see, it was
just eight years ago that America's defenses were in a pitiable
state _ weaker, relative to the threats we faced than at any time
in decades.
   We had airplanes that couldn't fly for lack of spare parts. Our
Navy had declined from more than a thousand battle-ready ships to
fewer than 500. Among our men and women in uniform, morale was
understandably low.
   And yet, at the same time, the Soviet Union was embarked upon a
massive arms build-up enlarging its armed forces on land, sea, and
air. The Soviet Union had invaded Afghanistan. It was backing
communist expansion in Africa, in Asia, and yes, with the
Sandinistas in Nicaragua in our hemisphere.
   The trend was clear _ American power and influence were
declining while the power of the totalitarian world was growing
greater and greater. The implications for the cause of freedom, for
the cause of peace, were grim. The trend had to be reversed.
   During these last eight years, we've done just that _ restoring
America's strength. The results _ well today, the Soviets are
withdrawing from Afghanistan; we're seeing progress in settling
regional conflicts, and not long ago, an American President
returned from a successful summit in Moscow having earlier signed
the first treaty in history that actually reduces nuclear arsenals.
   By the way, if we had listened to those who wanted to stop the
deployment of our INF missiles in Europe, the so-called ``Freeze
Movement,'' we would have thrown away the bargaining leverage that
forced the Soviets to return to the negotiating table. We would not
have signed the INF Treaty in Washington, and Soviet SS-20 missiles
would still be pointed at our allies.
   This brings me back to the defense bill that I just vetoed.
   You see, if I had accepted that bill, it would have undermined
the strength we worked so hard to restore, in time, jeopardizing
all our remarkable diplomatic advances.
   Congress' defense bill represented an all-but-open attempt to
block our strategic defense initiative, or as we call it, SDI. Yet
no development has been of greater importance in our strategic arms
negotiations with the Soviets than our decision to proceed with SDI.
   The idea of SDI is simple: to give us the advance technologies
necessary to defend us and our allies from attack by nuclear armed
ballistic missiles. Some said it would take years to develop such a
technologically sophisticated defense system. We said all the more
reason to get started right now. And in fact, as SDI has gone
forward, overall progress has taken place even faster than we had
hoped.
   Perhaps the best endorsement for SDI comes from the Soviets
themselves, since they've long engaged in many kinds of strategic
defense programs of their own.
   But Congress wants to cut our budget request for SDI deeply.
Congress also wants to cut all requests for funding one of the most
promising SDI technologies, the space-based interceptor program, by
over 70 percent.
   It is not just the damage done to SDI's funding and space
component that concerns me. From requirements for unilateral
disarmament, missile testing, the bill represents an attempt by
Congress to handcuff the President in our arms reduction
negotiations with the Soviets. And this kind of unilateral
concession with the Soviets could set back all the progress we've
made on the arms reduction front.
   Now that I have vetoed the defense bill, there's talk on Capital
Hill about producing an even worse defense bill as an act of
political retribution. Well, let me ask you, what could be more
deplorable than to use the defense of this nation as a political
pawn? It won't happen. Not if I have anything to say about it.
   As long as I'm President, our nation's defenses, including our
strategic defenses, will remain above partisan politics.
   Congress needs to go back to work to pass a new defense bill,
one that I can sign because it strengthens our negotiating hand,
instead of weakening it. We may be Republicans or Democrats, but
when it comes to a strongly-defended nation, we must all be simply
Americans.
   Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Registered nurses and service workers put
up picket lines Saturday at French Hospital, joining strikes
against seven other hospitals in San Francisco and the surrounding
area.
   Negotiations between the hospital and the California Nurses
Association, representing French's 130 nurses, broke off Thursday
and talks with Local 250 of the Hospital and Health Care Workers
Union broke off Friday.
   Lawyer Laurence Arnold, chief negotiator for French, said the
sides remained far apart on wage issues.
   Meanwhile, talks with nurses at two public hospitals and city
health centers continued into the weekend. Local 790 of the United
Public Employees had granted two extensions, but union negotiator
Jean Smith warned: ``We don't want to give this an infinite amount
of time.''
   `We are talking and we are making some progress,'' said Smith.
   Seven hospitals in the Affiliated Hospitals group were in the
12th day of a strike by 1,700 health-care workers, such as
orderlies, dietitians and licensed vocational nurses.
   The other Affiliated hospitals are Children's, Marshal Hale,
Mount Zion, St. Francis, Pacific Presbyterian and St. Mary's, all
in San Francisco, and Seton Medical Center in Daly City. All except
Pacific Presbyterian were in the fifth day of a strike by 2,000
registered nurses belonging to the CNA.
   Local 250 is locked in a dispute over health benefits and sick
leave and the nurses' union is fighting for higher wages.
   At the seven hospitals affected by the striking Local 250 and
the CNA,
   Outside workers and nurses were flown in to cope with the
walkouts at the Affiliated hospitals. However, the number of
patients dwindled to 772 by Thursday, down from 895 earlier in the
week.
   No new talks have been scheduled among the struck hospitals.
   In anticipation of the strike against French, all admissions but
emergencies were cut off and elective surgeries were canceled, and
by Friday the number of patients had dwindled to about 40, half the
usual number.
   French's nurses are demanding raises of 11 percent and 10
percent over the next two years. The hospital has offered three
raises of 6 percent each over the next 31 months.
   Meanwhile, negotiations continued in an attempt to avert a
strike Thursday by 1,600 nurses belonging to Local 790 against two
public hospitals, San Francisco General Hospital Laguna Honda
Hospital, and city health centers.
   Local 790 originally set a strike deadline for last Monday but
twice extended it after city Health Department Director Dr. David
Werdegar and two deputy mayors entered negotiations Wednesday.
   The public hospitals have been under a wage freeze and nurses
did not get an expected raise this year. The nurses want a two-year
contract with a guaranteed 14 percent raise, and limits on the
number of patients to nurses in critical care sections; the
hospitals want a one-year contract with a continued wage freeze.
   The city has an emergency plan if a strike occurs at General,
which cares for the city's poorest and sickest patients, and Laguna
Honda, which cares for more than 1,000 elderly. The plan includes
seeking help from hospitals in surrounding counties, volunteers and
private ambulance companies.

<HEAD>Three Chinese Families Granted Asylum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is granting asylum to three
Chinese couples and their families because of fear they would face
persecution for violating China's stringent family-planning policy,
the Justice Department said Saturday.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese approved requests for asylum from
the three families under new department guidelines that pertain to
China's family planning program, a department spokeswoman said.
   The three Chinese citizens who along with their families are to
be granted asylum were identified as Dr. Quan Bang Li, Dacheng Cong
and Jiguang Zhou.
   Li is believed to be a resident of Phoenix, Ariz., where he been
working as a mechanical engineer, according to The Washington Post.
The whereabouts of the other two families could not be determined
Saturday.
   Deborah Wade, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said she
had no additional information about the families and presumed that
some of them wish to avoid publicity.
   The Chinese government in an attempt to curb population growth
has adopted a policy aimed at encouraging families to limit their
size to no more than one child.
   A couple with only one child receives free health care for the
child as well as priority in schooling and housing, increased
pensions and salary bonuses.
   People who have more than one child, however, may lose their
membership in the Communist Party, be fired from their job and find
the purchase of certain items such as fuel and agricultural
supplies difficult, according to a recent State Department report
on human rights around the world.
   In granting asylum to the three families, the department gave
its first indication that it had adopted new guidelines in dealing
with couples who request asylum as a result of China's family
planning policies.
   These guidelines call on immigration officials to ``give careful
consideration'' to such applications when the Chinese citizens
``express a fear of persecution upon return to (China) ... because
they refuse to abort a pregnancy or resist sterilization'' after
the birth of one child.
   If such refusal ``is undertaken as an act of conscience with
full awareness ... as to the severe consequences which may be
imposed (by Chinese officials) for violation of (the family
planning) policy ... it may be appropriate to view such refusal as
an act of political defiance sufficient to establish refugee
status,'' the new department guidelines say.

<HEAD>Angola Cease-fire Agreement Reportedly Reached</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported Saturday
that Cuba, South Africa and Angola have agreed on a cease-fire in
the 13-year-old Angolan war as well as a mutual pullback of troops.
   Delegations from the three countries announced Friday in Geneva
that they had agreed on an unspecified ``sequence of steps'' to
achieve peace in southwestern Africa.
   The Star, South Africa's largest daily, said in an unattributed
report that the steps included a cease-fire.
   It said that according to the agreement, South African troops
were to withdraw from southern Angola, and Cuban forces were to
withdraw to at least 60 miles north of Angola's border with
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   Angola-based guerrillas of the South-West African People's
Organization, the main guerrilla group fighting for Namibian
independence, also would be required to pull away from the border,
The Star said.
   The four-day session in Switzerland was the fifth round of
U.S.-mediated talks aimed at resolving the war in Angola and
granting independence to Namibia. The talks began in May.
   Details of the agreement reached there were to be disclosed next
week after negotiators report to their governments.
   Another round of talks is to take place within three weeks, with
the exact date and location to be announced.
   On Tuesday, South Africa unveiled a proposal calling for a
cease-fire in Angola on Wednesday and independence for Namibia by
June 1, 1989 if Cuba withdraws its estimated 50,000 troops from
Angola by that date.
   Cuba and Angola publicly rejected the proposal, but the talks
proceeded.
   Cuba previously offered to withdraw its troops from Angola over
a four-year period. The troops have helped the Marxist government
fight the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or
UNITA, a guerrilla movement which receives military aid from South
Africa and the United States.
   A spokesman for UNITA in Lisbon, Alcides Sakala, indicated his
organization would not observe a cease-fire unless it is brought
into the negotiations.
   ``As long as UNITA is not a part of the (peace) process, no
change will come about in Angola,'' he said Friday.
   In July, parties to the talks announced agreement on a set of 14
principles as a framework for a settlement.
   A joint statement issued then did not mention the role of UNITA,
South-West African People's Organization or the African National
Congress, the main black group fighting white rule in South Africa.
   South Africa called in its proposals Tuesday for the dismantling
of seven guerrilla camps it said were operated in Angola by the
ANC. It was not clear whether this was addressed in Geneva.
   South Africa also proposed to start withdrawing its estimated
50,000 troops from Namibia on Nov. 1. South Africa's mandate over
Namibia was terminated by the United Nations in 1966, but it has
retained control over the territory in defiance of several U.N.
Security Council resolutions.

<HEAD>Judge Extends Supreme Court Ruling On Police To Cover Garbage
Collectors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A garbageman who found a picture of a
partially dressed woman while collecting trash did not violate her
constitutional rights by showing the photo to friends and owes no
damages, a federal judge ruled.
   ``The court premised its decision in part on the basis that
people should expect their trash to be searched by trash
collectors,'' U.S. District Judge Sam C. Pointer wrote.
   Pointer said his July 25 opinion was based partly on a May
Supreme Court decision that gave police the right to use evidence
rooted out of the trash in criminal cases.
   The trash collector's display of the photograph, showing the
woman in her underwear, was ``clearly for his own amusement,'' but
violated no federal law or constitutional rights, the judge said.
   The woman's attorney, Craig Izard, said the photograph was taken
as a prank by her daughter while the woman dressed last December.
The photo was not in any way suggestive, but the woman found it
embarrassing, he said.
   The lawsuit was filed May 10 by the woman and her husband. It
named the city of Oneonta and the trash collector, identified as
Richard Eakes, as defendants.
   Izard asked that the name of his client not be used. ``She lives
in a very small town and it would be embarrassing to her. It's bad
enough what's already happened,'' he said.
   According to the suit, the man was showing off the photograph at
a Christmas family gathering when one of the woman's friends or
relatives realized who it was.
   The man's ``publication of a photo of a partly clad (woman) may
have caused embarrassment to her and her husband,'' Pointer wrote.
``This does not, however, infringe upon any constitutionally
protected liberty interest.''
   The couple is considering an appeal or possibly a state lawsuit,
Izard said.

   City manager Neil DeLuca outlined his
``doomsday scenario'' as fines levied by a federal judge mounted:
First he would lay off non-essential workers, then sanitation
workers and then police and firefighters. Finally, he'd fire
himself.
   ``It might be the best thing that ever happened to me,'' he said.
   A dispute between a defiant City Council and a judge who ordered
it to desegregate housing has split this already divided city,
which has been hit with fines that double daily and could bankrupt
Yonkers this month unless the council complies with the order or
gets an appeals court to intervene.
   ``The city moves from crisis to crisis and this is the worst
yet,'' said former Mayor Angelo Martinelli. ``It's one thing to
have the councilmen go down. It's another to see the city go down
the tubes after all everyone has done in the past to save it.''
   Yonkers hovered on the brink of bankruptcy in 1984 because it
underfunded its school system.
   In 1985, U.S. District Leonard Sand, who last week found the
city in contempt and imposed the fines, found the city liable for
40 years of intentionally segregating its schools through
segregated housing.
   The racial divisions evolved through the city's shape _ split by
the Saw Mill River Parkway, with the older, more industrial section
on the west and the affluent area, which includes Sarah Lawrence
College and houses with manicured lawns, to the east.
   Some 6,800 units of low-income housing were built in the 1960s,
mostly on the west side. Originally, they housed the Irish,
Italians and Slavs, but those groups prospered and moved to the
east side.
   Blacks and Hispanics from New York City's borough of the Bronx,
on Yonkers' southern border, took their place and now account for
nearly 30 percent of the city's population.
   The judge wants the city to build low- and middle-income housing
all over the city, not just on the west side.
   But last week the City Council voted 4-3 to reject a package of
incentives to attract developers of 800 housing units.
   Sand, as promised, assessed fines of $500 a day against each
recalcitrant councilman and an escalating fine against the city
that began at $100 a day Tuesday and doubles daily. It reaches
$3,200 Sunday and by day 22 the city's $337 million budget will be
wiped out, along with the jobs of its 1,800 municipal employees.
   The councilmen also are threatened with jail terms if they are
still in contempt after Aug. 10.
   ``The real tragedy is Yonkers was doing so well economically
before this,'' said Mayor Nicholas Wasiscko, 29, who supports the
desegregation order. ``We've had three years of surpluses and there
really has been an economic rebirth. Except for this.''
   Once, the city of 200,000 people was known as the City of
Gracious Living. Some black leaders now call it the City of Racist
Living.
   ``Whites will violate the law to keep blacks out of their
neighborhoods, whites will pay huge fines to keep blacks out of
their neighborhoods and whites may even go to jail to keep blacks
out of their neighborhoods,'' said Marvin Andisson, 27, who lives
in the Schlobohm Houses, one of the city's worst housing projects.
   Others say race is not at issue. ``I am absolutely convinced it
is (a dispute) of class,'' said Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   Residents focus on the effect of the judge's order on the value
of their homes and complain bitterly that Yonkers is being
persecuted.
   Yonkers has 24 percent of the population of Westchester County,
but about 40 percent of the county's low-income housing. Other
towns have none.
   Opponents of the judge's housing plan fear their town might
follow the path that transformed the Bronx into New York's poorest
borough.
   ``We worked and saved all our lives so we could move out of the
Bronx to this beautiful neighborhood and for what?'' asked John
Loggio, 62, whose house faces a site for 22 low-income homes. ``So
we won't be able to sell our house? Its value has lost $100,000.''
   On the other side of town, a few blacks are opposed to the plan,
too, like Stonewall Odom, who said Sands' order could ruin the
black community and its political base. He called it ``plantation
politics.''
   ``We need education, jobs, we don't need any more handouts.
Judge Sand is condemning my son to poverty,'' Odom said.
   Allen Cunningham, a black who moved to Yonkers two years ago,
said that while blacks need housing, ``It's going to hurt relations
between blacks and whites. It's going to hurt us.''
   Some of the councilmen who voted against the housing plan last
week received bullets and dead rats in the mail earlier this year
when they approved a consent agreement providing for the housing.
   Now that the councilmen have reversed themselves, some groups
have promised to hold fund-raisers for their defense.
   ``We hope they won't betray us again,'' resident Bernadette
McLaughlin said after the council's most recent vote. ``We know we
aren't guilty of anything. We've done nothing wrong.''

<HEAD>Burmese Government Sells Food As Soldiers Patrol Streets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers armed with bayonets patrolled
the streets of the Burmese capital Saturday, and authorities began
selling food to counter soaring prices and hoarding, officials and
travelers said.
   Thai and Western travelers returning to Bangkok from Rangoon
described the city as quiet but tense, with armed soldiers
stationed at street corners and small groups of people gathering to
discuss the country's troubles. Soldiers placed empty oil barrels
along some streets to force vehicles to proceed slowly, they said.
   Thousands of Burmese demonstrated in the past two weeks against
newly-elected President Sein Lwin, who moved quickly to quash all
political dissent. He ordered the arrests of the most outspoken
critics of the authoritarian system and several other people,
including Associated Press correspondent Sein Win.
   Sein Lwin was elected president and chairman of Burma's only
political party after the resignation of Ne Win, a general who
seized power in 1962.
   The president promised economic reforms, and authorities
Saturday began selling such items as rice, cooking oil, salt and
fish through various cooperatives units ``to help relieve manual
laborers and low-income earners affected by rising prices of basic
foodstuffs,'' the official Radio Rangoon reported.
   The price of rice _ which one Western diplomat called a
``barometer of tension'' in Burma _ has quadrupled over the past
few months.
   ``Farmers and traders are hoarding it because there's no
confidence in the present government,'' said the diplomat, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``If that leads to
shortages...that might trigger more violence.''
   Rangoon-based diplomats link the price increases, hoarding of
food and other economic hardships to the general tension in the
country.
   Sein Lwin has endorsed a package of reforms aimed at loosening
government control over the economy and attracting private foreign
investment, which has been forbidden.
   But diplomats in Rangoon and visitors to the capital in recent
days say Burmese businessmen appear to be skeptical of the proposed
measures and fear another demonetization of the currency as a
simplistic way to deal with inflation.
   The government last fall suddenly withdrew several currency
notes from circulation without compensation, sparking riots and
talk among Burmese that the government had engaged in ``official
robbery.''
   Some businessmen reportedly say that the 64-year-old Sein Lwin
may push the reforms through in order to cling to power but believe
there will be little follow-up to the measures, since the former
military officer is considered an old guard socialist.
   Once regarded as a potential economic power in Southeast Asia,
Burma's influence slipped under Sein Lwin's predecessor.
   Over the past year, conditions have worsened and Burma _ with an
annual per capita income of less than $200 and a $4 billion debt _
was forced to apply to the United Nations for Least Developed
Developing Country status.
   Although the state in principle supports providing basic food
supplies to its people through government-run stores and
cooperatives, the population has had to rely in recent years on a
vast black market stocked with items smuggled from other Asian
countries.
   However, residents say even the once plentiful goods on
Rangoon's ``free markets'' have disappeared recently, accompanied
by soaring prices.
   The illegal trade has also deprived the government of badly
needed revenue, with luxury items such as jade, rubies, gold, teak,
cattle and antiques leaving the country in exchange for basic
necessities.

   A powerful earthquake rocked eastern
India, Bangladesh and Burma early Saturday, triggering landslides,
damaging buildings and sending residents fleeing from their homes,
news reports and witnesses said.
   No deaths were immediately reported, but at least five people
were slightly injured when buildings collapsed in India's Manipur
and Assam states. Both areas are hilly but are heavily populated in
valleys.
   ``People ran out of their houses and started praying,'' said B.
Goswami, a resident in the town of Guwahati, contacted by
telephone. Guwahati, in Assam state, is about 900 miles east of New
Delhi.
   In parts of Calcutta, women blew conch shells, an ancient Indian
tradition believed to appease the weather gods, according to the
Press Trust of India news agency.
   The quake, which began at 6:09 a.m. and registered 7.3 on the
Richter scale, lasted for more than two minutes, according to the
Seismological Observatory in New Delhi.
   About eight hours later, an earthquake registering 6.3 on the
Richter scale jolted parts of Pakistan and Nepal and was felt in
New Delhi, according to the earthquake center at the Pakistani
Meteorological Department. No injuries or damage were immediately
reported.
   The New Delhi observatory said the epicenter of the first quake
was in an isolated, hilly region in neighboring Burma, about 15
miles from the border, more than 1,000 miles east of the Indian
capital.
   Tremors were also felt in Dhaka, the capital of neighboring
Bangladesh, but there were no reports of casualties or damage.
   Property damage and brief power outages were reported in
Manipur, Assam and Nagaland states.
   In Imphal, the capital of Manipur, about 75 miles from the
epicenter, two people were slightly injured when part of a building
collapsed, Press Trust said.
   In Tiniali Bam, in Assam state, three people were hurt when a
house collapsed.
   The United News of India reported the roof of a Hindu temple in
the town of Sibsagar in Assam collapsed and some adjoining
buildings had cracks and shattered windows.
   The quake also triggered landslides in parts of Assam, forcing
suspension of train service, Press Trust said.
   The epicenter of the second quake was about 280 miles northeast
of Islamabad in the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan and
northern Pakistan, according to the earthquake center at the
Pakistani Meteorological Department.
   Earthquakes in eastern India are frequent, according to H.N.
Srivastava, the director of the Seismological Observatory in New
Delhi. No major quakes have occurred in the region in recent years,
but an earthquake in 1950 killed about 300 people in Assam.
   The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake as
measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase
of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.
   A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable
of widespread damage in populated areas.
   A quake measuring 7.3 in Quetta, in what is now Pakistan, killed
more than 30,000 people on May 31, 1935.

   The leader of the Gurkha separatist
movement formally announced the end of a violent 2-year-old
insurgency Saturday, the United News of India said.
   ``The Gurkhaland movement has ended,'' the news agency quoted
Subash Ghising as saying in Darjeeling in the West Bengal state.
   Gurkhas, who are Indian citizens of Nepalese descent, live
mainly in the tea-growing Darjeeling region in northeastern India.
Ghising's Gurkha National Liberation Front has been seeking a
separate state within the Indian union since April 1986 to protect
the Gurkha's culture and language.
   More than 300 people have died in the Gurkha rebelllion against
the Indian government.
   Ghising made his announcement shortly after returning from New
Delhi, where details were worked out on an agreement reached in
July with the India government.
   Under the agreement, Gurkhas are to receive limited
administrative control of the 1,230 square miles Darjeeling area.
   An estimated 650,000 of India's 2.1 million Gurkhas live in the
Darjeeling district.

<HEAD>Dukakis Wraps Up Western Campaign Swing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis met with Western
governors and other Democratic officials Saturday, declaring he
``loves the West'' and leads in the region over Republican George
Bush.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor and Democratic presidential
nominee, met in private for nearly three hours with the Democratic
group and emerged saying they were in broad agreement on Western
concerns and the chances for a Democratic victory in the region
that has been dominated by the GOP in presidential elections since
1964.
   ``We're ahead now, there's no reason why we shouldn't stay ahead
and build on that lead, and I think it's because the people of the
West are ready for change,'' said Dukakis, who later donned a
cowboy hat and was presented with a pair of cowboy boots.
   ``I think we have an opportunity to win the West, and I mean all
the West,'' he said.
   Dukakis revealed no specific policy agreements reached with the
nearly 50 elected Democrats including governors from 10 states,
members of Congress and former governors. On questions of water and
oil, big issues in much of the West, Dukakis said only that he
wanted a ``national energy policy'' and a ``national water
policy,'' while voicing caution about diverting water between
regions.
   Among those present for the meeting were former presidential
candidates Bruce Babbitt, the former governor of Arizona, and Gary
Hart, the former Colorado senator.
   Dukakis' running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, was
campaigning in his home state Saturday, where he told a group of
Hispanic veterans that the Republicans were playing politics with
national defense.
   ``Decisions on national defense are now being based on the
latest political poll at the White House,'' Bentsen said in an
appearance before the American G.I. Forum.
   Bush, meanwhile, was spending the weekend at his home at
Kennebunkport, Maine, where no public events were scheduled.
   Dukakis was concluding a three-day campaign swing that took him
from Mississippi to California and Washington state before stopping
in Colorado.
   Dukakis began his day in Denver with a brisk, 2.6 mile walking
workout at dawn in a park, along with Colorado Gov. Roy Romer,
California Sen. Alan Cranston and some of the reporters and
photographers who travel with him.
   Dukakis invited them along at the end of a week in which he
faced questions about his health. He later said of the press,
``They're in bad physical condition and I'm worried about them.''
   He spoke to about 2,000 people at an outdoor rally in the same
park, standing in the hot sun before a spectacular view of spouting
water, the Denver skyline and the Rocky Mountains. He planned a
brief stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on his way back to Boston.
   Dukakis enjoys a substantial lead over Bush in most national
polls, but pollsters rate Colorado as a tossup.
   Appearing with some of the officials at a news conference after
the meeting, Dukakis said he favored placing restrictions on small
handguns but said he recognized the ``perfectly legitimate right''
of sportsmen and others to own guns.
   ``My principle concern is small, concealable handguns whose only
purpose is to kill people,'' Dukakis said. He had been asked if he
supported national gun control legislation.
   Referring to those small weapons, he said, ``I think they have
to be subject to strict regulation.''
   Making his second visit to Colorado in a month, Dukakis
described himself as someone who ``loves the West,'' and that after
campaigning in the region he is ``impressed even more with its
grandeur, its uniqueness, with the independence and the values of
its people.''
   ``Believe me,'' he said, ``you're going to see me out here many,
many times'' if elected.

   A commercial photo lab processor who told police
about lewd photographs involving a man and a young girl says he was
fired for ``doing the right thing.''
   Charles Markey's action led to the arrest of William Bennett,
52, and Veronica Martinez, 45, who were charged with first-degree
sexual abuse, authorities said.
   Markey, 21, said he lost his job at Hot Shots 30 Minute Photo
Lab within minutes of the couple's arrest on Thursday.
   ``The arrest and his firing are totally unrelated,'' said a
manager at the lab, who identified himself only as Alan.
   Markey admitted he was 15 minutes late for work the day of the
arrests. But he also said his bosses had scolded him for calling
police and that ``everyone there gave me the silent treatment.''
   ``It seems silly, but they fired me for doing the right thing,''
he said.
   On Monday, he said, he found five photographs allegedly showing
Bennett, the owner of a music school, masturbating while a young
girl sat next to him on a piano bench.
   Markey tried to call his boss, he said, and when he couldn't
reach him, called the police.

   A bomb exploded in a hotel
casino moments after security officers discovered it and evacuated
the building, authorities said Saturday.
   Police said the bomb caused no damage because a special blanket
was thrown on it just before the blast. There were no injuries.
   The incident occurred Friday night at the Morula Sun, a resort
hotel near Pretoria in the black homeland of Bophuthatswana.
Gambling is illegal in South Africa, except in the homelands.
   No one claimed responsibility for setting the bomb.
   Police have blamed a recent series of explosions on the African
National Congress, the outlawed guerrilla movement which since 1961
has waged a violent campaign aimed at toppling South Africa's
white-led government.

   The Republican chairman of the National
Governors Association opened the group's election-year meeting
Saturday with a pledge to make the conference non-political and
non-partisan.
   ``I'm going to display tremendous discipline,'' said Gov. John
Sununu of New Hampshire, a strong supporter of Vice President
George Bush and frequent critic of Gov. Michael Dukakis, his
Massachusetts neighbor and the Democratic nominee for president.
   Dukakis planned to attend Tuesday's final session of the
four-day meeting of the nation's governors.
   President Reagan was flying in Monday to address the conference.
   At a news conference opening the meeting, Sununu said, ``I'm
aware that our meeting has been bookended by the two major
political gatherings of 1988 _ the Democratic National Convention
and the Republican National Convention.
   ``We're also as governors very much aware that the success of
the NGA depends on the very bipartisan, non-partisan character of
our deliberations.''
   He added that ``for my part I'm going to try to make this the
most non-political, non-partisan, non-presidential year event that
you've ever seen.''
   Participating in the news conference with Sununu were two
Democratic governors, host Richard Celeste of Ohio and Gerald
Baliles of Virginia, who is slated to succeed Sununu as NGA
chairman.
   The two Democrats agreed that during the past seven and a half
years, President Reagan had succeeded, at times over the protests
of governors, in transferring many domestic responsibilities from
the federal government to the states.
   In keeping with Sununu's admonition to keep the meeting
non-political, neither he nor his Democratic colleagues would
address directly the question of how they felt Bush and Dukakis
would deal with relations between the federal and state governments.
   ``I won't touch that one with a 10-foot poll,'' said Sununu.
   Sununu has had a long, bitter fight with Dukakis over the
Seabrook nuclear power plant. Dukakis played a key role in blocking
licensing of the facility that sits on the New Hampshire seacoast
near the Massachusetts border.
   An early backer of Bush for the GOP presidential nomination,
Sununu was one of three governors said to be on Bush's list of
potential vice presidential choices. The other two were Jim
Thompson of Illinois and Carroll Campbell of South Carolina.
   Gov. George Deukmejian of California sent Bush a letter asking
that he not be consider for the No. 2 spot on the national ticket.
   The Republican National Convention convenes on Aug. 15 with Bush
the certain presidential nominee.
   Another governor, Thomas Kean of New Jersey, will deliver the
convention keynote address.
   Democrats outnumber Republicans among the nation's governors by
a margin of 27 to 23, but many states expected to be major
battlegrounds in the presidential election have Republican
governors.
   In addition to California, Illinois, and New Jersey, they
include Texas with Gov. William Clements and Florida with Gov. Bob
Martinez.
   Big states with Democratic governors include New York with Mario
Cuomo, Pennsylvania with Robert Casey, Ohio with Richard Celeste
and Michigan with James Blanchard.
   Governors who played key roles at the Democratic convention last
month that nominated Dukakis for president and Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen for vice president were Blanchard who was chairman of the
Democratic platform committee and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas who
delivered the speech placing Dukakis' name in nomination.
   Once thought of as officials who could make a difference
politically in their states, governors have lost some of that
luster in recent presidential elections.
   The fact that Democrats held a majority of the governorships in
1980, did not help Jimmy Carter win re-election against Reagan's
challenge. And, of course, a Democratic majority in statehouses did
nothing to stem the Reagan landslide in 1984.
   The National Governors Association was meeting at a time when
many of the chief executives were expressing concern over what they
consider the erosion of the role of states in their relationship
with the federal government.
   ``Because of Supreme Court decisions in recent months and years,
Congress is free to regulate every minute detail of state
administration and management, and every sector of society that
states traditionally had regulated,'' said Sununu.
   One of the court decisions that upset governors was a ruling
last spring that declared Congress had the authority to end the
federal tax exemption for state and local bonds.

   The USS San Juan, the Navy's newest

anti-nuclear weapons demonstrators.
   The nuclear attack sub, built by General Dynamics Corp., is the
third U.S. Navy ship to bear the name San Juan, the capital of
Puerto Rico.
   The vessel is 360 feet long, 33 feet wide and displaces about
6,900 tons of water when submerged. A so-called Los Angeles-class
sub, the San Juan is designed to hunt and destroy enemy submarines.
   About 10 anti-nuclear weapons opponents staged a demonstration
outside the submarine base to protest the commissioning. There were
no arrests, police said.
   Puerto Rico territorial Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon attended the
ceremony.

   James P.S. Devereux, a World War II hero and
former congressman, has died of pneumonia at the age of 85.
   Devereux died here Friday at Stella Maris Hospice.
   He earned the Navy Cross while leading the Marines' defense of
Wake Island during a Japanese attack in 1941. Devereux, who spent
the rest of the war in Japanese prison camps, was elevated to
brigadier general at his retirement in 1948.
   He was elected to Congress as a Republican in 1950, representing
Maryland's 2nd District. He gave up his seat eight years later to
run unsuccessfully for governor against J. Millard Tawes.
   In 1960, he was named Republican chairman for the district and
was Baltimore County director of public safety from 1962 to 1966.
   Devereux remained active in politics, campaigning for other
candidates, and also operated several horse farms.
   He is survived by his wife, Edna, and three sons, three
stepdaughters, a stepson, and 12 grandchildren.

<HEAD>Police Seize Copies Of Anti-Apartheid Newspaper</HEAD>

   Police officers across the
country Saturday seized newsstand copies of The Weekly Mail, a
prominent anti-apartheid newspaper.
   Clive Cope, the newspaper's business manager, said the
commissioner of police had ordered the seizure in terms of
state-of-emergency regulations but had not specified a reason for
the action.
   The emergency regulations authorize seizure of publications
which government officials deem to contain subversive statements.
   The Weekly Mail's co-editor, Irwin Manoim, said the newspaper
would file an urgent application in Johannesburg Supreme Court
challenging the seizure and requesting an explanation for the
action.
   The Weekly Mail is published on Fridays, and Cope said most of
the 32,000 copies of the latest edition would have been sold by the
time the seizure was conducted Saturday morning.
   ``We don't have any idea why this happened,'' Cope said. ``We're
quite baffled by it.''
   Established in 1985, The Weekly Mail is oriented primarily
toward white liberals. It is respected for its aggressive reporting
and the generally high caliber of writing.
   The government has warned the newspaper twice in recent months
that it faced a possible three-month suspension for violating
censorship rules.
   Such suspensions were imposed this year on two other
anti-apartheid newspapers, New Nation and South. They have resumed
publication.
   Articles in the current edition of The Weekly Mail include a
report of black municipal policemen fatally shooting a black high
school pupil in Soweto and a package of stories about a group of
143 white men who Wednesday announced their intention to refuse to
perform mandatory military service.
   One section of the emergency regulations defines as a
``subversive statement'' any comment construed as undermining the
conscription system.
   The emergency regulations in effect since 1986 also restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions and treatment of
detainees.
   Under apartheid, South Africa has a racially segregated society
in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.
The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate
districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Afghanistan Says Nine Dead in Rocket Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas staged a rocket
attack on the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, killing nine people
and injuring 10, official Kabul radio reported Saturday.
   The attack occurred Friday, the radio said in a broadcast
monitored in Pakistan.
   Afghan rebels have been fighting the Soviet-backed government
for 10 years.
   The radio also said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
was still in the Afghan capital of Kabul on Saturday and met with
federal and provincial government officials.
   On Friday, the radio reported Shevardnadze had left the Afghan
capital. The broadcast Saturday made no reference to the earlier
report.
   Shevardnadze made a surprise trip to Kabul on Thursday for
meetings with Afghan President Najib.
   Kabul radio also said Soviet soldiers would be be pulled out of
the besieged city of Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.
   According to a U.N.-brokered accord signed in April, the Soviet
Union must withdraw half of its troops in Afghanistan, estimated at
more than 100,000, by Aug. 15. The remainder must be withdrawn by
Feb. 15.
   Soviet and Afghan officials say 35,000 Soviet troops have left
since the withdrawal began May 15.
   Kabul radio quoted Afghan army leaders in Kandahar as saying
they could defend the city against guerrilla attacks without Soviet
assistance.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The conservation staff of the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art has begun repairing four paintings that were
damaged last week while on display, an official said.
   Museum spokeswoman Pamela Jenkinson characterized the damage as
minor scratching of the varnish covering the paintings, but would
not say how it occurred or who was thought to have done it.
   ``I don't think I should comment on that right now because we
don't comment on security investigations,'' she said.
   The paintings are ``L'Allegro,'' by 19th century American artist
Thomas Cole; ``Still Life,'' by Carlsen, also a 19th century
American; ``Portrait of Cardinal Roberto Ubaldini,'' by Guido Reni,
a 17th century Italian artist, and ``Capricco Piazzo San Marco,''
by Canaletto, an 18th century Italian artist.
   The artwork belongs to the museum's permanent collection and
each piece was in a different room.

   Penn State Coach Joe Paterno, who has a
history of putting winners on the football field, will try to help
make George Bush a White House resident with a seconding speech at
the Republican national convention, party officials said Saturday.
   ``I think it's a great thing for us, I think it's a great thing
for George Bush and I think it's a great thing for Pennsylvania,''
Elsie Hillman, the chairwoman of Bush's presidential campaign in
Pennsylvania, said from her home in Pittsburgh.
   ``He's (Paterno) really well respected by the citizens of
Pennsylvania and I think he commands a lot of respect and I think
people in Pennsylvania will respond to his judgement,'' she said.
   Suzanne Paterno, reached by telephone Saturday morning at the
couple's home in State College, confirmed a report in Saturday's
editions of The Philadelphia Inquirer that her husband would make
the speech, but said he was not immediately available for comment.
   Clark Reid, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee in
New Orleans, said the names of those scheduled to give nominating
speeches would not be released until Monday, but others at Penn
State and in the state Democratic and Republican parties confirmed
the decision to have Paterno speak.
   Penn State's Nittany Lions are a perennial powerhouse in college
football and won national championships in the 1982-83 and 1986-87
seasons.

<HEAD>Military Government Expels Canadian Parish Priest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The military government expelled a
Canadian priest accused of disturbing Haiti's social and political
order after he refused to reveal the names of his parishioners,
radio stations reported Saturday.
   Rev. Rene Poirier, a Roman Catholic parish priest in the
southern town of Grand Goave, was accused by Haiti's army rulers of
making ``insulting public declarations which are liable to disturb
the social and political order established in the country,'' Radio
Metropole reported Saturday.
   Poirier, 54, allegedly refused a demand by a local police
official in Grand Goave that he submit a list of members of his
congregation who attended one of his recent religious services,
Radio Haiti Inter reported.
   Though it is unclear why the official wanted the names, Poirier
is known to be a member of the radical wing of the Roman Catholic
Church which opposes the military government and calls on the poor
to organize themselves politically. He lived in Haiti for four
years, Radio Metropole said.
   Poirier, whose presence in Haiti was judged ``undesirable'' by
the government communique, was arrested in Grand Goave by soldiers,
transported to Port-au-Prince and placed on board a New York-bound
flight Friday night.
   The soldiers also confiscated several cassettes of religious
sermons in Poirier's rectory.
   ``The expulsion of Father Poirier is a warning directed by the
military government at the Catholic Church that any action in favor
of mobilizing the people for democracy will not be tolerated,''
Franklin Midi, a Haitian sociologist and former Catholic layman,
told The Associated Press Saturday.
   Poirier was expelled the same day Haiti's leader, Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy, was on a tour in the Grand Goave region. On the tour,
Namphy said Haitian problems should be solved by Haitians, not
foreigners.
   Namphy also vowed the army would harshly put down any public
disorder.
   The armed forces chief deposed civilian President Leslie Manigat
in June and sent him into exile. Namphy headed a three-man junta
that ruled Haiti for two years after former President Jean-Claude
Duvalier was ousted in February 1986.

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old boy is expected to recover
fully from an accident in a which a rod pierced his skull just
below his right eye and punched through his brain and up against
the back of his skull.
   Brian Swartz was bicycle riding with his brother along a country
road near the Cumberland County town of Newville last week when his
bike struck a hay rake along the road, puncturing a tire and
pitching him forward onto the metal rod, which his father said was
part of the rake.
   While his brother Jerry, 15, rushed to a nearby house for help,
Brian lifted himself from the rod and, feeling dizzy, lay down on
the ground.
   ``It was just scary,'' Brian said. ``I pulled myself off _ I
guess I didn't realize what I was doing.''
   ``I was scared I was going to die,'' Brian said. ``It was
close.''
   The boy's father, Jerry, soon arrived and he and his wife,
Deborah, placed ice, towels and a damp cloth over the wound and
took Brian to Carlisle Hospital, about 10 miles away. Brian was
treated in the emergency room and transferred to Polyclinic Medical
Center in Harrisburg.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Dr. Hugh Knight, who treated Brian
at Carlisle. ``It's very uncommon someone would survive. It just
seemed to hit the right area.''
   Brian is expected to recover completely, said Dr. Howard Stein,
senior resident in the joint pediatric program of Polyclinic and
Hershey Medical Center.
   ``The injury is something we see occasionally,'' he said. ``That
he came through without anything wrong is remarkable. I've never
seen anything like it.''
   Brian was transferred out of intensive care the day after the
accident Tuesday and into the pediatric unit.
   ``I only have a headache and a big bump on the back of my
head,'' Brian said.
   Swartz, who passed out when he first learned details of his
son's injury from doctors, said Brian's survival was a miracle.
   ``This is one in a million,'' he said. ``It's hard to believe
anything like this could happen and he would not have brain damage
or a physical handicap.''
   ``I really feel strongly that there was only one way this boy
survived _ God was looking over him,'' Swartz said.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Try To Make Their Way East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over wide sections of
the eastern half of the nation Saturday, with some rain also in the
Southwest, and a cold front brought almost autumn-like cool relief
to part of the northern Plains.
   Showers and thunderstorms were widespread ahead of a slowly
moving cold front that curved from New York state into the middle
Mississippi Valley.
   Thunderstorms were scattered over parts of central and eastern
New York state, with heavy rain reported at Albany. Showers and a
few thunderstorms spread from western and central parts of
Pennsylvania into much of Kentucky.
   Rain and thunderstorms also extended off the central Gulf Coast.
Low pressure over southwestern Mississippi brought brief heavy rain
to coastal parts of Louisiana and Mississippi and into the southern
third of Alabama. Those storms also spread west into parts of
southeastern Texas.
   Other showers and thunderstorms were scattered in western North
Carolina through central and eastern South Carolina, southeastern
Georgia and much of Florida.
   A cold front extending from south-central Canada to northern
California also triggered showers and thunderstorms.
   Ahead of the cold front, afternoon temperatures were in the low
to mid-90s, but behind the front, readings were mostly in the low
to middle 60s and Cut Bank, Mont., dipped down to 55 degrees.
   Livingston, Mont., recorded wind gusting to 66 mph early in the
afternoon while the front was crossing the area.
   Widely scattered showers developed across the eastern half of
Arizona and western parts of New Mexico, and showers and
thunderstorms developed in Arkansas and into northeastern Texas and
parts of western Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees at Cut Bank, Mont., and Tacoma, Wash., to 103 at Williston,
N.D.; Gila Bend, Ariz.; and Blythe, Imperial, Palm Springs and
Thermal, Calif. The nation's low Saturday morning was 37 degrees at
Truckee, Calif.
   For Sunday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from central and eastern New England through the middle and
southern Atlantic Coast, the central and eastern Gulf Coast and
northern and central Florida. Showers and thunderstorms developing
during the afternoon and evening were forecast from the upper
Mississippi Valley through middle Missouri Valley into parts of the
northern and central high Plains, and over parts of the West.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted along the Pacific Coast and in
parts of northern Idaho and northwestern Montana; in the 80s from
the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah to the Rockies, and from
the central and eastern Great Lakes through the upper Ohio Valley
and central Appalachians to the mid-Atlantic region and New
England; in the upper 90s to around 100 in much of central and
western Kansas, and the central and southern Rio Grande Valley;
between 100 and 110 across the desert Southwest; and in the low to
mid-90s across most of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Runcie Says ``Impossible'' Conference A Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, told the
closing session of the Lambeth Conference of bishops Saturday that
what had been called an ``impossible'' conference was a success.
   The first meeting in 10 years of the Anglican bishops was
overshadowed by the prospect of the consecration of the first
Anglican woman bishop in the next few months by churches in Canada
and New Zealand and the U.S. Episcopal Church. ``Some thought this
conference was impossible. Reason and experience suggested we would
fall apart. But keeping our eyes on the Lord we have not sunk,''
Runcie said.
   Critics said the controversial issue of the first woman bishop
would break up the three-week conference in Canterbury, wrecking
the Anglican Communion of 27 self-governing churches in 164
countries.
   The opponents say the act would irreparably damage the bonds
with Anglican churches that want to keep the all-male episcopate
and the church would decline into a loose federation, with some
dioceses breaking away.
   The critics say traditionalist bishops would feel they could not
be in communion with the consecrated women because bishops are
regarded as successors of the apostles of Jesus Christ, who were
all men.
   But Runcie masterminded a compromise resolution which by a
423-28 vote pledged the churches to respect one another's decisions
and instructed him to set up and head a commission to examine
relations between the churches when a woman bishop is actually
consecrated.
   ``I hope I speak for many others beside myself in testifying
that this conference has for me created spiritual energy and fresh
vision,'' Runcie said.
   After three weeks of debate over issues of poverty, injustice,
militarism and war, the 66-year-old archbishop said of the
conference:
   ``It has not been without conflict, because persons of flesh and
blood inevitably move in and out of conflict and grow through it.
Most of all it has been joyful discovery _ the discovery of a
common treasure despite our diversity.''
   Runcie concluded with a quotation from a sermon preached more
than 30 years ago at Cambridge by Martin Niemoeller, the German
Lutheran pastor and opponent of dictator Adolf Hitler.
   ``As long as the church lives only for herself, as long as Peter
_ the first of the apostles _ does not leave the boat, she lives
safely and undisturbed,'' he said.
   The bishops voted Friday to let England continue appointing
their leader, the archbishop of Canterbury.
   Pressure for an end to the custom stems from the rapid growth of
the Anglican Church in Africa, Asia and the Pacific.
   The bishops voted 177-163 against a resolution asking the
churches to ``consider the implications of the archbishop of
Canterbury being appointed from among any of the bishops of the
Anglican Communion.'' Forty-four delegates abstained.
   Runcie is spiritual head of the Church of England and leader of
Anglicans worldwide, including 2.5 million Episcopalians in the
United States.
   The conference closes Sunday with a service in Canterbury
Cathedral, the Anglican mother church.

<TEXT>
   ``Ear Force One,'' a balloon likeness of
Mickey Mouse, was grounded by high wind Saturday, but seven small
Iowa towns still got a lift from the celebration of the 60th
birthday of Walt Disney's famous cartoon character.
   An estimated 15,000 people filled this north-central Iowa
community of 1,200 for a parade, fireworks and birthday party that
doubled as a pep rally for Sheffield and six neighboring towns
depressed by the farm crisis of the 1980s and the drought of 1988.
   Children squealed for attention from Mickey Mouse, his
girlfriend, Minnie, and pals Donald Duck and Goofy, and townsfolk
quickly sold out thousands of T-shirts and other souvenirs at the
start of the two-day festival.
   The Rev. Dick Streeter of First United Methodist Church in
Sheffield, said residents hope the celebration will help the area
commit itself to rebuilding its farm-based economy.
   ``We discovered some things a few years ago that weren't
particularly pleasing. The main street was boarding up, and
enrollment in our schools was declining. We realized that the money
was being funneled to the metropolitan areas,'' Streeter said.
   ``It's amazing what Mickey Mouse has done for us,'' he added.
``This is a Disney movie come to life.''
   Disney spokeswoman Mimi Schaff said the company normally
celebrates milestone birthdays of cartoon characters at Disneyland
at Anaheim, Calif., Disneyworld at Orlando, Fla., or in some major
U.S. city.
   But the fair in Sheffield is the first time Disney has taken its
party to a rural area, she said.
   The celebration was part of the unveiling of ``Kernel'' Mickey
Mouse, a huge likeness planted in a 520-acre farm field northeast
of Sheffield, about 90 miles north of Des Moines.
   The field, planted in corn and oats, features a 3{-mile
circumference likeness of Mickey's head and is easily recognizable
from 30,000 feet above the Iowa countryside, although it can't be
seen from the ground.
   The high visibility to 150 commercial airline flights passing
overhead daily is why Disneyland asked farmer Dick Pitzenberger and
his sons to plant the field.
   ``It wasn't that tricky to plant. The curves weren't that
tight,'' said Rick Pitzenberger. ``Cultivating it was a little
tough.''
   Farm fields across much of Iowa are suffering from a severe
drought, and the 6.5 million corn plants that make up Mickey's head
are no different, although they did benefit from some timely rain
earlier this summer.
   Ear Force One, a 12-story hot-air balloon also shaped like
Mickey's head and topped with a birthday hat, couldn't be inflated
because of high wind.
   The communities were putting together a huge birthday card to
give Mickey by the end of the weekend and $7 T-shirts were a hot
item.
   ``We've just been pulling them out of the boxes and selling
them,'' said Mary Schissel of Dougherty, who said the 10,000 shirts
ordered for the two-day celebration were almost sold out in the
first hours of the festival.
   The post office was putting its stamp on the event with a
special cancellation mark for post cards picturing Mickey's
likeness in the field.
   ``We've sold more than 2,000 of them,'' said Jane Etnier, the
Sheffield postmistress, who called the event the biggest thing to
happen in her hometown.

   About 5,000 wailing mourners at the
funeral of an assassinated Moslem leader beat their chests and
heads Saturday and set fire to U.S., Soviet, and Saudi flags.
   Attackers shot and killed 42-year-old Arif Hussain Hussaini, a
Shiite Moslem leader who headed an opposition political party, on
Friday. The assailants were not identified, and no one claimed
responsibility.
   Party officials said Hussaini was killed outside a mosque in
Peshawar as he left after morning prayers.
   Demonstrators chanted slogans Saturday against President
Mohammad Zia ul-Haq when he arrived at a park where mourners were
gathered. Zia offered prayers for the slain leader.
   Meanwhile, the acting head of Hussaini's opposition political
party, the Movement for Enforcement of Shiite Jurisprudence,
demanded that Saudi Arabia release Iranian prisoners he said were
charged with the 1987 violence in Mecca. About 400 people, mostly
Iranians, were killed in the Mecca unrest.
   If the prisoners are not released by Friday, Sajid Ali Naqvi
said Pakistani Shiites will demonstrate throughout the country.
   Sporadic demonstrations broke out in several Pakistani cities
after Friday's assassination, but they were quickly brought under
control.
   Most Iranians are Shiites, but Sunnis outnumber Shiites in
Pakistan. Both sects hold Mohammad as their prophet, but the
Shiites have been at odds with the predominant Sunni branch of
Islam for 1,300 years.
   Iran observed a day of mourning Saturday for the slain Shiite
leader.
   One mourner, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Hussaini's murder was part of ``America's CIA policy.'' He charged
that United States, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Zia's government were
collaborating to divide Islam.
   Hussaini's party issued a statement Friday calling the
assassination a ``calculated move and a conspiracy to plunge
Pakistan into civil war.''
   A resolution passed by the Punjab branch of Pakistan's leading
opposition party, the Pakistan People's Party, said the killing was
an attempt to thwart opposition demands related to a Nov. 16
general election.
   Zia dismissed the civilian government May 29 and called the
general election in which candidates will be forced to run as
individuals, rather than as members of a political party.
   Opposition parties have called on the president to lift this
condition, saying it is unfair to their candidates. Although
Hussaini also opposed this condition, he was not considered a
radical or an outspoken critic of the Zia.

   The final televised ``In Performance at the
White House'' concert of the Reagan administration was planned to
include a surprise finale _ the first lady Nancy Reagan joining a
kick line from Broadway's ``A Chorus Line.''
   The series ``gives a great deal of pleasure to people who are
watching,'' Mrs. Reagan said in an interview on Saturday afternoon.
``I feel strongly that art is an important part of our lives.''
   She spoke in the library of the White House a few hours before
the last of 17 concerts to be televised during the Reagan
administration, adding that it has been fun for her, too. Since
Marvin Hamlisch has been master of ceremonies, he has had Mrs.
Reagan up and performing several times.
   The final concert _ to be broadcast by PBS on Wednesday _ is the
only one held outside of the White House. A Broadway-size stage,
too big for the East Room, was set up on the South Lawn, for
performances by the Marine Band, an 80-voice choir from Morgan
State University in Baltimore, an alumni cast from ``A Chorus
Line'' and soloists Shirley Jones, Stubby Kaye and Lee Roy Reams.
   ``We've never played one of Marvin's songs before,'' Mrs. Reagan
said. ``Tonight we play `One' and he gets me up to kick with the
chorus.''
   Hamlisch has conferred with Mrs. Reagan about planning before
each of the concerts in the last two seasons. Last season's four
concerts were tributes to American music, to George Gershwin,
Rodgers and Hart, Cole Porter and Jerome Kern. This season's three
concerts salute Broadway.
   Mrs. Reagan thinks the concerts are especially meaningful to
viewers because they're in the White House. Musicians feel it, too,
she says. ``The most seasoned performer becomes very nervous at
performing in the White House. When you go up and feel their hands
and they're ice cold, you do get the idea.''
   ``In Performance at the White House'' began in 1981. Four
concerts by master performers and young talents they'd discovered,
beginning with pianist Rudolf Serkin, born in 1903, and violinist
Ida Levin, born in 1963, were hosted by soprano Beverly Sills.
Country singer Merle Haggard and fiddler Mark O'Connor, 20, were on
that series.
   Concerts were televised from the White House during the Carter
administration but not organized as series with themes.
   The 1982-83 season, hosted by violinist Itzhak Perlman, included
a jazz concert with young singer Diane Schuur, whom Mrs. Reagan
called ``a great, great talent'' and one in which Mary Martin sang
to her. ``It nearly _ it did _ break me up, it was so touching,''
she said. ``I was in a play on Broadway, `Lute Song,' with Mary,''
Mrs. Reagan said. The other two concerts that season were classical.
   Both the Reagans like music, the first lady said, and will
continue as listeners after they retire to Bel Aire, Calif. ``It's
a house we have not lived in before; we sold our house,'' she said.
``It's a little hard getting it ready, 3,000 miles away, but we're
trying to do what we can.''
   They like all kinds of music, she said, adding, ``We're not
crazy about rock.'' She hopes that televised concerts from the
White House will continue with the next administration and said,
``I'll be watching.''
   Only once has she requested a song, Mrs. Reagan said. ``The time
I was in the hospital I asked Barbara Cook to sing `Don't Ever
Leave Me,' a favorite of ours. That's the one show I missed; I saw
it on TV.'' Her health since that October 1987 hospitalization for
a mastectomy has been excellent, she said.
   She has spoken at each televised concert. ``I introduce them and
at the end Ronnie goes up and says a few words and I go up with
him. That has been the usual format.
   ``Marvin has had me sing to Ronnie, `Our Love Is Here To Stay.'
Pearl Bailey sang `Hello, Nancy.' She pulled me up and started to
do a little dance and said, `My feet are so tired.' Then I tried to
do a few steps.'' Some of the audience thought that was planned.
``It wasn't rehearsed,'' Mrs. Reagan said. ``Marvin says he didn't
know that she was going to do this. You know with Pearl, you never
know what she's going to do.''

   King Hussein closed his ministry for
Israeli-occupied territories Saturday, official reports said, but a
government official pledged Jordan would still honor its passports
there and keep the border open to the West Bank.
   Hussein's moves, which included a minor Cabinet reshuffling,
came after his announcement last week that he would sever links
with the West Bank, which Jordan controlled before Israel seized it
in the 1967 Middle East War.
   The decision to transfer the remaining tasks of the Ministry for
Occupied Territories to the Foreign Ministry signaled the king's
view that relations with the territories are now a foreign, not a
domestic matter.
   Hussein has said the changes are in response to the PLO's desire
to ``secede'' and form its own state with its heart in the West
Bank.
   However, a senior government official said Jordan would stay
committed to the ``rights of its fellow Palestinian citizens unless
the PLO asks the contrary.''
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said ``any
citizen who holds the Jordanian passport, wherever he resides and
regardless of his origin, is considered a son of this country.''
   Two-thirds of Jordan's 3.5 million people are Palestinians
carrying Jordanian passports. All West Bank residents and some from
the Gaza Strip hold the Jordanian passport.
   Jordan's decisions unleashed widespread worry among West Bank
Palestinians that they might no longer be allowed to travel to
Jordan.
   Commenting on the possibility of closing down the Jordan River
bridges that lead to the West Bank, the government official said
``this measure will never be taken under any circumstances.''
   The official Jordan News Agency said the king presided over a
Cabinet meeting late Saturday and said the latest moves have
``enhanced the role of the PLO as the prime party in solving the
Palestinian issue.''
   Hussein was quoted as saying that cutting ties with the West
Bank foiled Israeli ``plots'' aimed at setting up Jordan as an
alternative Palestinian homeland.
   The Reagan administration and some officials in Israel have
called for talks on Palestinian autonomy on the West Bank with
Jordanian involvement.
   Jordan's new body for dealing with the occupied territories, the
Palestinian Affairs department, will be under the jurisdiction of
Foreign Minister Taher Masri, the official agency said.
   Under the reshuffling, the incumbent Minister for Occupied
Territories, Marwan Dudin, became minister of labor, state-run
Radio Jordan said.
   A senior Jordanian official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the king was scheduled to leave on a tour to
discuss the policy changes with other Arab leaders. The official
said the king would visit Egypt, Syria, Iraq and a number of
Persian Gulf states in the next few days.
   A move to establish a Palestinian government-in-exile has been
under discussion by PLO leaders, but a senior PLO official in Amman
said his organization ``does not yet have the resources to
achieve'' it.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press that a high-level PLO delegation would arrive in
Jordan to discuss with Hussein ``the curing of the wounds which
were created by the kingdom's recent measures.''
   The official, who said the delegation would arrive Thursday,
added that the group is worried about ``the political and legal
vaccum left inside the territories.''

<HEAD>Chicago Sun-Times Names New Acting Publisher To Replace Page</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Sun-Times announced Saturday that
Charles T. Price, the newspaper's senior vice president and general
manager, will serve as acting publisher until a replacement is
found for Robert E. Page, who resigned two days ago.
   ``We have a strong management team in place, and we are looking
forward to further establishing the Sun-Times as a vital Chicago
institution,'' Price said in a statement published in the
newspaper's Sunday editions.
   Page told editorial employees on Thursday that he was selling
his minority interest in the newspaper company to the investor
group that owns it and stepping down ``with regret'' as the
Sun-Times' president and publisher.
   Price's appointment as acting publisher was announced by
Sun-Times Chairman Leonard P. Shaykin, a managing partner of Adler
& Shaykin, the investment firm that arranged a $145 million
leveraged buyout of the newspaper from international media magnate
Rupert Murdoch in 1986.
   Shaykin said Price would serve as acting publisher ``while our
search for a new publisher continues.''
   Price, 44, formerly was a partner in the Cleveland law firm of
Baker & Hostetler, where he represented the Sun-Times and other
newspapers.
   He grew up in Urbana, Ill., and is a graduate of Ohio Wesleyan
University and Harvard Law School.
   Page, 52, came to Chicago from Murdoch's Boston Herald to serve
as the Sun-Times' president and publisher in 1984 after the
Australian's News America Publishing Corp. bought the paper from
its longtime owners, the Field family of Chicago.
   When Murdoch sold the Sun-Times to the investors' group, Page
said he was embarrassed by some of the newspaper's sensationalism
and promised ``a more serious, more purposeful'' look.

   Israel Television on Saturday said authorities
seized a draft of a ``declaration of independence'' drawn up by
Palestinians leaders who planned to set up a PLO-led state in the
occupied territories and parts of Israel.
   The television said the seizure would either totally prevent or
seriously disrupt the planned independence initiative, and it
broadcast what it said were portions of it.
   The broadcast came one hour after U.S. envoy Richard Murphy
arrived for talks with Israeli leaders. The talks will focus on
Jordan's cutting of ties with the occupied territorites and the
impact on a U.S. plan that hinged on Jordanian representation of
Palestinians in Middle East peace talks.
   State-run television said the independence document was in works
before Jordan's King Hussein announced last week his intention to
pull back from the occupied territories and hand over
responsibility to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The report said a draft version was seized by the Israeli
security forces during a search at the east Jerusalem Arab Studies
Institute immediately after the institute's leader, Feisal
Husseini, was detained on Aug. 1. Husseini is viewed by Israeli
officials as a leading PLO figure.
   It was the first time that the seizure of the draft declaration
was announced and its contents revealed.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's office issued a statement which
said the document was filled with ``insane and dangerous dreams
that will not come true.''
   Some Palestinians suggested the document was leaked to justify
Husseini's arrest, which was protested by the United States, Israel
Radio reported.
   The television said that the paper, called ``A declaration of
Palestinian independence document,'' included names of dozens of
Palestinians who were to become members of a ``local Parliament.''
   It was not immediately clear whether Palestinians whose names
appear on the list would be arrested.
   It said the document called for a Palestinian state headed by
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, with PLO executive Farouk Kaddoumi as
his foreign minister and heads of other PLO factions as ministers.
   The state would include the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
and some land inside Israel, according to the report. Israel seized
the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt in the 1967
Middle East War.
   However, Palestinians who composed the document also called for
recognition of Israel's right to exist and peace talks based on the
clarification of future border lines, linkage between the West Bank
and Gaza and future ties with Israel, the television said.
   It said the document's authors wanted ``to push Israel to the
wall'' by issuing the declaration and continuing violent protests,
while giving their state a chance of being recognized by supportive
Arab nations.
   They also stressed the need to receive a Soviet blessing, the
television said.
   Meanwhile, hundreds of Palestinians holding Jordanian passports
streamed across Jordan River bridges into Jordan to express concern
over their future and King Hussein's decisions to sever links with
Palestinians in the occupied lands.
   Hussein canceled a $1.3 billion development plan for the West
Bank, dissolved the lower house of Parliament and announced the
dismissal of 21,200 Palestinian employees working for Jordanian
institutions in the West Bank and Gaza.
   On Saturday, he abolished the ministry for Israeli-occupied
territories and put the Foreign Ministry in charge of its
functions. The move signaled the kingdom's view that relations with
the territories were now a foreign, not a domestic, issue.
   ``King Hussein might close the bridges, and if he does, it will
be my last visit to Jordan,'' said Amman-born Salwa Abu Kaf, 27.
   Arab sources said most of the Palestinians traveling to Jordan
were concerned about their ties with relatives living in the
kingdom, children employed in the gulf states or economic links
with Jordan.
   Several Palestinians said they planned to seek residence in
Jordan so that their families would not be separated.
   In Amman, a government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Saturday his government would keep those bridges
open and continue to honor Jordanian passports held by residents of
the occupied territories.
   Shamir's spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said Jordan's decision to
dismantle the occupied territories ministry was ``yet another
artificial step to separate Palestinian Arabs'' living on the East
and West Bank.
   Protests erupted Saturday in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
where underground Palestinian leaders called on followers to
``greet Murphy with demonstrations and clashes'' with troops.
   Murphy did not speak to reporters after his arrival. He is due
to meet Sunday with Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
   Troops wounded three Arabs hours before Murphy's arrival, and a
15-year-old boy died after being shot Friday, Arab reports, the
army and Israel Radio said.
   The death raised to 237 the number of Palestinian victims in the
uprising, which began Dec. 8. Four Israelis also have died.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The private British news agency Reuters Ltd.
says it has taken steps to avoid future ``procedural errors'' such
as those that resulted in a $400,000 fine for re-exporting
U.S.-origin microcomputer equipment.
   The Commerce Department on Friday announced that Reuters had
agreed to the civil penalty. The department said that between April
1983 and December 1986, Reuters made 488 shipments of such
equipment from the United Kingdom and other locations to various
destinations around the world, including East Bloc countries.
   Reuters said it was under the mistaken belief that the shipments
were permitted under a distribution license held by its U.S.
subsidiary.
   Reuters, in a statement, said it was the company's understanding
that the department ``would have granted licenses for virtually all
of those equipment shipments had the correct procedure been
followed. Reuters has put in place extensive controls to avoid any
future such procedural errors.''
   The department said Reuters acknowledged that more than 100 of
the shipments occurred while the company was subject to a 24-month
probationary period resulting from a previous case involving
similar violations.
   The $400,000 fine includes $23,400 which represents a civil
penalty for the earlier violations that had been suspended and
would have been waived if Reuters had fully complied with
regulations during the probationary period, Commerce said in a
statement.
   Reuters voluntarily disclosed the violations to the Commerce
Department and cooperated with the investigation, the department
said.
   The Commerce Department administers and enforces the Export
Administration Act, which restricts exports and re-exports when
necessary because of national security, foreign policy or domestic
short supply.
   Reuters added that the company ``maintains ownership and
ultimate control over each item of the relatively unsophisticated
equipment in question, thus the risk of diversion and threat to
U.S. national security is diminished.''
   The computer equipment is used in Reuters' Monitor service by
clients trading on financial markets around the world, according to
the Commerce Department.

<HEAD>Armenian Dachas to Become Health Care Facilities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armenian officials are planning to turn country
houses for high-ranking officials into health care facilities for
children and war veterans, Pravda said Saturday.
   ``These former special institutions of rest for high-ranking
officials will be converted into centers to provide follow-up
treatment for children, treatment and rest for the invalids of
World War II and internationalist fighters and for foster
children,'' the Communist Party newspaper said.
   Country houses, called dachas, in the Soviet Union range from
small cabin-like structures to opulent mansions built as summer
homes in czarist Russia. Most used by Communist Party officials as
retreats are large and well-furnished.
   Pravda did not give details on how many country houses are to be
converted or their location.
   Pravda included the report in a story including criticism of
food supplies, transportation and other consumer goods and services
in the southern Soviet republic.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had criticized mismanagement in
the republic. The criticism came before the republic was torn by
unrest in recent months as Armenians have agitated for annexation
of Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian region of neighboring
Azerbaijan.
   Mass demonstrations and strikes were held in Yerevan, the
Armenian capital, since February, but they quieted down in mid-July
when the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's highest
executive body, rejected the annexation demand.

   A baby girl found abandoned in a jetliner
restroom only hours after she was born soon will be sent to live
with her paternal grandparents in New York, her court-appointed
lawyer said.
   Month-old Alyssa LoCasto has been in a foster home since she was
found in the restroom of a DC-10 at San Francisco International
Airport on July 13. The infant's mother, Christina LoCasto,
secretly gave birth just before the aircraft left Newark, N.J.
   ``The baby will be transferred from California to New York in
the next few days,'' attorney Gerry Hilliard said Friday.
   San Mateo County Juvenile Court Commissioner Patricia Bresee on
Friday continued an earlier ruling giving temporary custody to
Alyssa's grandparents John and Frances LoCasto of Staten Island, a
borough of New York City.
   A county social worker will take Alyssa to Staten Island, where
her parents will be able to visit her under the supervision of the
borough's Special Services for Children department, Hilliard said.
   Alyssa will stay with her grandparents at least until Oct. 14,
when Bresee will decide if the temporary arrangement will continue.
   Mrs. LoCasto, 24, has pleaded innocent to a charge of felony
child endangerment.
   Mrs. LoCasto is accused of giving birth in the jetliner restroom
and hiding the newborn under the sink before returning to her seat
with her husband and two older daughters. Her husband, Louis
LoCasto, 26, was with her on the trip but had not known his wife
was pregnant and was unaware she had given birth, according to
lawyers in the case.
   The couple have said they hope to regain custody of the infant.

   Anti-nuclear weapons protesters displayed
30,000 warhead-shaped cones at the Washington Monument Saturday as
part of national ceremonies marking the dropping of an atomic bomb
on the Japanese city of Hiroshima 43 years ago.
   The cones, about six inches high, were arranged to form a
``ban-the-bomb'' symbol, containing the likeness of a mushroom
cloud. Organizers said the cones _ obtained from a Virginia textile
mill _ were designed to represent a fraction of the 50,000 warheads
stockpiled between the superpowers.
   ``We use all these textile cones to give people an idea of at
least what 30,000 looks like,'' said Pat Jackson, an organizer of
the protest..
   ``Our demonstration today is part of raising the public's
consciousness. I think we get very accepting and just used to all
the nuclear weapons out there. We're here to poke at people,''
Jackson said.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungarians convicted for their part in
the 1956 popular anti-Soviet uprising will no longer face
discrimination, a high government official pledged in an interview
published Saturday.
   Interior Minister Istvan Horvath also indicated that dissidents
should not necessarily be regarded as enemies of the communist
state, and he predicted reform of the nation's police.
   The minister was quoted by the Communist Party daily
Nepszabadsag as saying that ``the calling to account in court
should not mean an everlasting stigma ....''
   ``The (1956) protagonists ... almost all of them, have now been
discharged from the legal point of view, either as a result of
individual mercy or judicial rehabilitation,'' he was quoted as
saying.
   But he said some cases remain to be settled.
   Horvath's remarks suggested that authorities are willing to end
job discrimination and denial of passports to people who played a
role in the 1956 uprising, which was crushed by Soviets tanks and
troops.
   ``In given sharp social conflicts, at the time of ideological
and political clashes, the term `enemy' may be applicable, but it
may not become a perpetual category. A former enemy could become
neutral, in fact a cooperating partner, even an ally and a
friend,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Horvath also said there should be ``guaranteed sanctions''
against abuse of authority in the name of the state.
   He predicted a reform of Hungarian police but gave no details.
He said public security in Hungary ``excessively carries the
imprint of the approach that had been based on the omnipotency of
the state.''
   Hungarian officials have been liberalizing political policies
along the lines of reforms under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
They have allowed greater freedom of the press and invited
dissidents to engage the government in a dialogue.
   But they also have said that the supreme authority of the
Communist Party must remain intact.

<TEXT>
   An estimated 20,000 people marched
silently through the streets Saturday in a show of solidarity with
the Roman Catholic Church.
   The march, organized by the church, came six days after the
church said it was being persecuted by the government.
   Agents of President Alfredo Stroessner, who has ruled since
seizing power in a 1954 coup, watched the demonstration but did not
intervene. No incidents were reported.
   Tensions between the government and the church have risen since
July 25, when Spanish Jesuit priest Juan Antonio de la Vega was
expelled to neighboring Argentina, allegedly for publicly
advocating the overthrow of the government.
   Church officials denied the charge and said de la Vega, a
65-year-old theology professor, was explaining Liberation Theology,
a movement that advocates political action to achieve social change.
   The church, visited two months ago by Pope John Paul II, has
called on the government to relax authoritarian rule.
   Saturday's procession ended at the cathedral, where the
archbishop of Asuncion, Monsignor Ismael Rolon, celebrated a Mass.
   Later Saturday, Justice Minister Eugenio Jacquet told reporters
that a government that has the support of a strong political party
and the armed forces need not worry about church processions.
   Last Thursday, students at Catholic University _ the nation's
second-largest with an enrollment of 8,000 in the capital and four
branches in provincial cities _ boycotted classes.
   Last Sunday, priests said in messages read from the pulpit that
the church was being persecuted by the government. The message also
denounced ``arbitrary arrests (and) limitations on freedom of
expression.''
   Saturday's marchers carried banners supporting the church. No
anti-government banners were noticed.
   The estimate of 20,000 people marching was made by the Catholic
station Radio Caritas.
   On July 30, the church announced that the annual Te Deum Mass of
thanksgiving, set for Aug. 15, would be canceled because of de la
Vega's expulsion.
   The mass has been canceled on two previous occasions _ November
1969 and May 1972. Both cancellations followed the expulsions of
priests.
   Twenty-one foreign-born priests and religious workers have been
expelled since Gen. Stroessner took power.
   Last February, Stroessner won 86.7 percent of the vote in the
national balloting by which he was re-elected to an eighth, 5-year
term. Opponents charged massive vote-rigging and fraud.

   The military prosecutor's office has dropped
criminal proceedings against a former army private who deserted in
Afghanistan but returned home last month from Canada, Tass said
Saturday.
   Nikolai Golovin, 25, returned to the Soviet Union on July 19
from Canada, where he had lived the past two years, after Soviet
officials announced a general amnesty for those who deserted or
were taken prisoner during the Afghanistan war, the news agency
said.
   After returning to Moscow, Tass reported that Golovin had passed
on word to other deserters living in Canada that he had suffered no
reprisals.
   Golovin was under investigation for stealing a submachine gun
and selling it to an Afghan when he escaped from his unit in June
1982, it said.
   He was captured by Afghan guerrillas who are fighting the
pro-Soviet Afghan government.
   ``We have taken into account all extenuating circumstances,
including Golovin's voluntary return, and decided to stop the
proceedings and exempt him from criminal responsibility,'' Maj.
Gen. V. Provotorov told Tass.
   Provotorov quoted Golovin as telling investigators he suffered
much in captivity and wanted to redeem himself in his country by
working hard.
   Soviet forces intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979 to
support the communist government. In April, the Soviet Union signed
documents in Geneva agreeing to withdraw its about 100,000 troops
over a nine-month period, beginning May 15 and ending next Feb. 15.
The withdrawal began on schedule.

   A United Airlines DC-10 en route to Seattle lost
cabin pressure Saturday and safely returned to Stapleton
International Airport with passengers using oxygen masks, a United
spokesman said.
   Spokesman Rob Doughty said there were no injuries.
   However, four passengers were treated at two Denver hospitals
for chest pains, hypertension and lightheadedness, and released by
late afternoon, hospital officials said. Also, paramedics treated
several passengers at the airport who were shaken up by the
incident.
   United Flight 175, with 245 passengers and 11 crew members, had
reached about 22,000 feet when the problem developed, said Doughty,
who was reached at his home in Chicago. The plane left Denver about
30 minutes earlier.
   Doughty said passengers were asked to use the aircraft's oxygen
masks.
   ``We have determined the cause was a circuit breaker (on a unit)
that controls the pressurization of the cabin,'' Doughty said. ``We
have taken that aircraft out of service even though we know the
problem. We want to make a thorough investigation.''
   He said another DC-10 was sent to Stapleton to pick up the
passengers. That flight arrived in Seattle late Saturday afternoon.
   ``This is not the first time (this has happened),'' Doughty
said. ``It's just like a circuit breaker in your home going out.''
   Doughty said the situation was aggravated by a bomb threat
called in to a Denver television station. He said the unidentified
caller reported that the plane returning to Denver had a bomb
aboard, and hung up.
   He said the caller apparently had access to a radio with
aviation channels.
   Stapleton spokesman Norm Avery said the flight still was
climbing to its normal cruising altitude of 30,000 to 35,000 feet
when the decompression began. Avery said the airplane returned to
Stapleton at 1:04 p.m., about an hour after it left.
   Passenger Jennifer Warren, who was going to Seattle to visit
family and friends, said she thought at first the oxygen masks
popped out by accident.
   ``Then my ears started hurting. I thought I was going to die,''
Ms. Warren said after arriving at Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport.
   ``The crew should be commended. They kept everybody calm,'' said
Richard De Bolt, 22, of Olympia, Wash. He said most passengers were
more shaken up than hurt, although his seatmate, a woman who
recently had surgery, experienced pain.

   Iraq has given Jordan weapons and military
equipment won by the Iraqi army in its 8-year-old war with Iran,
King Hussein said Saturday.
   ``It pleases me to join the Jordanian armed forces in their
happiness over receiving weapons and military equipment, as a
brotherly gift, from the brave Iraqi army,'' said the king.
   His remarks were carried by the official Jordan News Agency and
on state-run Radio Jordan.
   Diplomatic sources said the donation includes American-made
tanks, artillery, arms and other military equipment.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
included ``surface-to-surface missiles, sufrace-to-air missiles,
vehicles and light automatic arms.'' They did not say how much the
weapons were worth or give further details.
   A Jordanian official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Iraq made a similar donation of captured Iranian weapons to
Jordan in 1981.

   Opponents of nuclear weapons held memorials Saturday on the 43rd
anniversary of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima, and some people
who favor a strong defense and nuclear deterrence staged
counterobservances.
   The observances were in the form of vigils outside nuclear
weapon plants, a mountain climb in New Hampshire, a bicycle ride in
California and the signing of a scroll in Boston.
   The observance In Hiroshima itself, 50,000 people attended a
ceremony in memory of the 78,000 people killed instantly in the
world's first atomic bomb attack.
   At the Washington Monument in the nation's capital, protesters
arranged 30,000 warhead-shaped cones to form a ``ban-the-bomb''
symbol, containing the likeness of a mushroom cloud. Organizers
said the 6-inch cones were designed to represent a fraction of the
50,000 warheads stockpiled between the superpowers.
   ``Our demonstration today is part of raising the public's
consciousness. I think we get very accepting and just used to all
the nuclear weapons out there. We're here to poke at people,'' said
Pat Jackson, an organizer of the protest.
   Actor Martin Sheen was among 64 people arrested for misdemeanor
trespassing at the Nevada Test Site, 65 miles northwest of Las
Vegas, in an anti-nuclear protest. He has been arrested on trespass
charges several times while participating in anti-nuclear rallies,
which have been conducted with growing frequency at the desert site.
   The protest came 11 days before a planned major nuclear weapon
test that will judge the ability of the United States and Soviet
Union to measure the size of each other's nuclear tests.
   At Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station in California, 24 protesters
were arrested for trespassing on government property.
   About 60 anti-nuclear activists gathered outside the Savannah
River Plant in Aiken, S.C., for a silent vigil. The plant is the
nation's only production site for the plutonium and tritium used in
nuclear weapons.
   Outside the Pantex Nuclear Weapons Plant, northeast of Amarillo,
Texas, the fifth annual Peace Camp opened with a sunrise meditation.
   Peace activists climbed Mount Monadnock in southern New
Hampshire to hold daylong vigils at the summit through Tuesday, the
anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki, Japan.
   Elsewhere in New Hampshire, six woman tried but failed to hang
peace symbols on a military monument at the headquarters of the
unit whose predecessor dropped the atom bombs on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki.
   A solid line of military personnel kept the members of the New
Hampshire Women's Network for Peace from the seven-foot
mushroom-cloud-and-eagle emblem of the 509th Bombardment Wing at
Pease Air Force Base.
   At Indianapolis, people who believe the bombing of Hiroshima was
necessary to end World War II and save many lives gathered at the
Indiana World War Memorial during the morning for prayers and a
short ceremony.
   Kathy Nikou, Indiana spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C.-based
Center for Peace and Freedom, said the bombing saved lives because
otherwise it would have been necessary to take over Japan island by
island.
   Residents of Portland, Ore., awoke Saturday to find the pavement
scattered with thousands of pale ``shadows'' painted by
anti-nuclear activists in memory of the bombing of Hiroshima.
   About 150 participants in the Shadow Project claimed to have
whitewashed 2,700 human and animal silhouettes on streets and
sidewalks in the 3{ hours before dawn.
   While they worked, a smaller rival group calling itself the
Solution Project painted placards of shields, outlines of the
United States and people carrying signs with the message, ``No More
Shadows _ Defense Works.''
   In Boston, the Women's International League for Peace and
Freedom asked passers-by on Boston Common to sign a scroll and also
write in the name of a victim of the Hiroshima bombing.

   An 80-square-foot section of the roof of
the Kiplinger Washington Editors' printing plant collapsed
Saturday, dumping six inches of roof water onto the presses below,
fire officials said. There were no reported injuries.
   Drains on the roof apparently were unable to handle a large
amount of rain that fell during a thunderstorm, said Tony
DeStefano, spokesman for Prince George's County Fire Department.
   The plant is owned by the Kiplinger Washington Editors which
publishes the Kiplinger Letters and Changing Times magazine.
   The water flowing through the 40-by-40 foot roof hole damaged
rolls of paper, ink and printing equipment. Damage estimates were
not immediately available.

   Michael Gartner, the Iowa newspaper editor
recently named to head NBC News, wasted no time taking on the
competition in a meeting with TV critics Saturday.
   ``One of the nice things about NBC News is that Tom Brokaw is
not Dan Rather,'' Gartner said when he was asked if news anchors
like CBS' Rather and Brokaw, have too much power. Each is managing
editor of his broadcast.
   With a sharp, dry wit, the former editor of the Des Moines
Register who replaced former news division president Lawrence K.
Grossman less than a week ago deflected questions about his plans.
   Gartner admitted he knows little about broadcasting and has to
learn a new vocabulary.
   ``I was in a meeting the other day,'' he said, ``and one of the
executive producers said, `Can I tell you something without
offending you?' And I said, `Even if you offend me you're going to
tell me, so what is it?' And he said, `Say `tape,' not `film.'''
   ``I'm a new boy,'' he said. ``It would be folly to go in and
start tinkering. I watch television news a lot more carefully than
I did two weeks ago, but I don't have an agenda.''
   The seven-figure salaries of network news stars he is supposed
to oversee don't bother him, said Gartner.
   ``I'll tell you what I told a reporter the other day who asked
how much I made. I said, `Less than Tom Brokaw and more than you.'

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strength among middle-class voters helped push
Gov. Michael Dukakis' lead over Vice President George Bush to 17
percentage points, according to a New York Times-CBS News poll
released Saturday.
   Fifty percent of those polled would vote for the Massachusetts
governor if the election were held now, while 33 percent said
they'd vote for Bush.
   A poll in early July, before the Democratic convention, showed
Dukakis with a 47 percent to 39 percent lead.
   In the most recent poll, Dukakis led Bush in all regions but the
South.
   Of the registered voters polled, 56 percent felt the Democrats
would do more for the middle class; 28 percent said the Republicans
would. Eighty-five percent identified themselves as middle-class.
   Those who identified themselves as moderates favored Dukakis 54
percent to 31 percent for Bush. Dukakis was leading among
independents, 49-32. Democrats who voted for President Reagan in
1984 favored Dukakis 58-18.
   Only 27 percent of those polled had a favorable opinion of Bush
and 33 percent had an unfavorable opinion _ the worst such ratio in
his term as vice president. Dukakis was rated favorably by 38
percent and unfavorably by 19 percent.
   The poll of 941 registered voters was conducted Sunday through
Wednesday and reported having a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega said Saturday
the best thing the United States can do to promote democracy in
Nicaragua is to end its ``dirty war'' of aiding anti-government
rebels.
   Ortega speech came two days before U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz's scheduled arrival in the region. Shultz, on a
nine-nation Latin American tour, has tried to rally allies against
the Nicaraguan government.
   In Washington, the U.S. Senate also is working on a new aid plan
for the rebels, known as Contras.
   ``Let them stop their aggression against the Nicaraguan people,
and this will be the best contribution to peace and democracy,''
Ortega said of U.S. support for the rebels.
   Congressional funding of the rebels ran out in February, but
U.S. Senate Democrats have proposed restoring $27 million in
humanitarian aid.
   It would also provide for trade benefits for Nicaragua if peace,
combined with democratic reforms, is achieved.
   But Ortega said if the Reagan administration and U.S. Congress
want to encourage democracy in his country, ``the only thing they
need to do is immediately stop their dirty war against the
Nicaraguan people.''
   Ortega made his comments in a speech in Esteli, about 90 miles
north of Managua.
   He reiterated the willingness of his leftist Sandinista
government to enter direct negotiations with the United States to
normalize relations.
   Last week, Shultz said he supported regional efforts to achieve
peace but that the Sandinistas were insisting on direct talks with
Washington.
   Referring to a Central American peace plan that is marking its
one-year anniversary Sunday, Ortega said the government still held
out hope for a negotiated solution to the 7-year-old civil war, in
which more than 26,000 people have died.
   ``We Central Americans also committed ourselves to promote
dialogue and peaceful solutions to conflicts'' in the region,
Ortega said.
   The peace plan, signed by five Central American presidents,
calls for negotiated settlements to civil wars in Nicaragua, El
Salvador and Guatemala and democratic reforms in the region.
   Peace talks between the Sandinistas and Contras broke down in
June, although a shaky cease-fire was unilaterally extended by the
government until the end of August.
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, author of the peace plan,
criticized the Sandinistas on Friday for failing to comply with its
terms.
   Shultz returns to Central America on Monday to consult on
Nicaragua with U.S. allies. He failed to obtain a condemnation of
the Sandinistas during a meeting last week with the foreign
ministers of Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Honduras.

   Anti-abortion demonstrations at three clinics
landed 69 more activists behind bars Saturday, joining more than
120 others already in jail from previous demonstrations who have
refused to identify themselves to police.
   Fifty-three members of ``Operation Rescue'' were arrested at
Midtown Hospital, 12 at the Atlanta Women's Medical Center on the
northside and four at the Atlanta SurgiCenter in midtown, said Tom
Pocock, deputy director of the Atlanta Bureau of Corrections.
   The clinics are three of seven in the area licensed to perform
abortions.
   In Florida, 133 anti-abortion demonstrators were arrested
Saturday at Tallahassee and charged with misdemeanor trespass,
police said. Except for two men jailed for resisting arrest without
violence, and three juveniles released to social workers, all had
bonds set at $100. But only four were released by late Saturday,
officials said.
   ``Apparently they're continuing their protest by not making
bond, same as they did in Atlanta,'' said police spokesman Duane
West. The Leon County Sheriff's Department prepared a makeshift
detention center at the North Florida Fairgrounds.
   The demonstrators arrested in Atlanta were charged with criminal
trespass and giving a false name to police, bringing to 276 the
number who have gone to jail since the current series of protests
began on July 19, during the Democratic National Convention.
Twenty-eight were charged with obstructing a sidewalk or highway,
Pocock said.
   Many refuse to give their names.
   Operation Rescue leader Randall Terry also was arrested and
charged with being a party to a crime, Pocock said. Initial
hearings for the protesters arrested Saturday were scheduled for
Monday but may be changed to accommodate the arresting officers'
schedules, Pocock said.
   Demonstrators are being held separately from the general inmate
population at various jails.
   As of Friday, 82 arrested protesters had been released by
disclosing their names and either posting $500 bond or being
released on their own recognizance.
   The group will continue pressing for the prisoners' release
under the names ``Baby Jane Doe'' and ``Baby John Doe'' _ which
many of the arrested have given in solidarity with aborted fetuses,
said Operation Rescue spokeswoman Dawn Stover.
   The activists have said they are willing to plead guilty to
criminal trespass charges under their aliases _ a deal prosecutors
have said would compromise the criminal justice system.
   Operation Rescue leader Randall Terry has said his group will
fill the jails as long as its members remain in custody, and that
hundreds of supporters will flock to Atlanta in the next few weeks.
   One minister who was arrested and released said Friday he and
other ministers would return with members of their congregations.
   ``We'll most likely be back with 200 to 300 others if that's
what it takes,'' said the Rev. David Diamond of Baton Rouge, La.
   Bob Fierer, an attorney who represents the jailed activists, was
preparing a court order at the direction of Fulton County State
Court Judge Nick G. Lambros, that would compel the protesters to
reveal their names in order to be arraigned.
   Fierer said the order would dramatize his clients' cause.
   ``It tends to underline the position they have taken, the
existence or non-existence of their names,'' he said. ``This is
something people are going to focus on.''
   But pro-choice forces cheered Lambros' action.
   ``Should (a court order) be issued, it would indicate the
court's desire to allow the judicial system to operate properly and
not as a tool of the extremists,'' said Elizabeth J. Appley,
attorney for the abortion clinics.
   ``We have always believed that these people should give their
names,'' said Sally Tyler, executive director of the Georgia
Abortion Rights Action League.
   ``I think it's naive of them to believe they could get arrested,
have criminal charges brought and then walk out as if nothing had
happened,'' she said.
   In Tallahassee, Saturday's arrests came at the conclusion of a
three-day rally protesting the imprisonment of a jailed colleague
when the demonstrators blocked the entrance to one of the city's
two abortion clinics.
   On Friday, an estimated 300 demonstrators marched on the Florida
Capitol seeking a clemency hearing for Joan Andrews, who is serving
a five-year sentence after being convicted of burglary after
interfering with operations at a Pensacola abortion clinic in 1986.

<HEAD>Brazilian Aides Upset by Statement to Shultz</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported Saturday that
aides to the foreign minister were worried by his anti-Nicaraguan
statement to U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.
   The report in Jornal do Brasil came as Shultz arrived in Rio de
Janeiro to spend the weekend relaxing before continuing his 10-day
Latin American tour Monday.
   On Friday in Brazilia, the secretary gained unexpected support
on the U.S. stand toward Nicaragua.
   Foreign Minister Roberto de Abreu Sodre told Shultz that
Nicaragua is ``out of line'' and must ``return to the democratic
path.''
   Sodre said his remarks were personal, but the statement was
still considered unusually strong for Brazil, which traditionally
has advocated non-interference in the internal affairs of other
countries.
   The Rio daily on Saturday said Abreu's statement ``alarmed''
Brazilian Foreign Ministry high officials, even though the minister
said he was speaking for himself and not compromising the country's
position.
   Brazil officially advocates a negotiated solution of the Central
American civil wars and opposes U.S. funding of Nicaraguan rebels.
   Shultz arrived from Brasilia, the modern inland capital about
750 miles southwest from Rio, where he met Friday with President
Jose Sarney and high officials.
   In Rio, he also had lunch with private businessmen Saturday.
Press coverage was not allowed. He planned to spend the weekend
relaxing, playing golf and going for a boat ride on scenic
Guanabara bay.
   Shultz will continue his nine-country tour Monday. He will go to
Bolivia first and then to Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador. On
Wednesday, he will attend the inauguration of Ecuador's new
president, Rodrigo Borja.

   Extra police patrols roamed upper Manhattan
Saturday after the city's second major power outage in two days
left tens of thousands of people without fans, air conditioners,
lights and elevators for 21 hours.
   Power was restored about 8 p.m. Saturday when workers repaired
three of five damaged feeder cables, said Consolidated Edison
spokeswoman Laurie Hanson.
   ``At this point it looks pretty good. But we can't rule out any
further problems,'' she said. Power was restored at a slightly
reduced voltage level but would not be noticed by most customers,
Ms. Hanson added.
   The blackout affected Harlem and Upper West Side residents from
Columbia University to Washington Heights, along the Hudson River
side of the island, on a muggy day with a high temperature of 89
degrees.
   The cause of the outage was not immediately known, but another
Con Ed spokeswoman, Pat Richardi, said the recent spate of hot
weather may have been a factor.
   No crimes were reported that were related to the power failure,
police Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell said.
   The outage began about 11 p.m. Friday, while Con Ed crews were
still struggling to restore power to a large area of lower
Manhattan, mostly office buildings near the financial district,
that was blacked out earlier in the day. Power was largely restored
Saturday in lower Manhattan, Ms. Richardi said.
   The upper Manhattan outage began with the failure of the fourth
out of 19 feeder cables that provide power to the region, Ms.
Richardi said. Cables had begun failing the day before, but the
electrical grid was able to re-route power until the fourth
failure, she said. A couple hours later, she said, a fifth feeder
cable failed.
   Included in the area of the blackout were Columbia University,
City College, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center and several large
housing projects. St. Luke's-Roosevelt was forced to rely partly on
an emergency generator, according to an administrator, Ann Baxter.
   Ms. Richardi said up to 5,000 customers were without power, but
noted that large buildings and institutions are sometimes listed as
a single customer, so the number of people affected was many times
greater.
   About 200 utility workers were assigned to the problem, working
in 80 manholes to replace the damaged cables, she said.
   Con Ed recorded its second-highest day of energy usage last
Tuesday, but power use slowly declined through the rest of the
week, Ms. Richardi said. Still, she said, ``the hot weather has to
be a factor.''
   Asked if there was any tie between the outage in lower Manhattan
Friday afternoon and the one in upper Manhattan Friday night, she
replied, ``I honestly don't know. I'm quite frankly speechless and
perplexed.''

   Five inmates escaped from jail Saturday
by smashing a hole through a concrete ceiling with a 5-pound chunk
of steel, authorities said. Two were later arrested in nearby
Albuquerque.
   ``I don't know how they got it,'' said Valencia County Sheriff
Lawrence Romero. ``If it came in a cake, it had to be a big one.''
   The escape was reported at 8:45 a.m., Romero said.
   ``We have reason to believe they've been out since 2:30 this
morning,'' he said. ``We had three different reports of attempted
auto theft ... We started getting in the reports about 2:30 or 3
this morning.''
   A pickup truck with two rifles and a pistol inside was stolen
from a volunteer firefighter, and authorities believe the escapees
have it.
   Three jailers were on duty when the inmates fled, Romero said.
All five apparently were in one cell at the north end of the county
jail.
   The escapees were identified as Eleno Avila, 24, of Mexico;
Damien Gonzales, 21, of Los Lunas; Tommy Cordova, 19, of
Albuquerque; Cruz Pacheco, 24, of Mexico; and Jesus Campana, 24, of
Mexico. Gonzales and Cordova were arrested without incident as they
walked along a road Saturday afternoon in Albuquerque, about 20
miles north, said Sheriff's Detective Mark Esparsen.
   Avila was being held on charges of aggravated assault with a
motor vehicle, reckless driving and eluding a police officer;
Gonzales was being held on charges of aggravated assault, battery
and criminal damage to property; Cordova was being held on charges
of residential burglary and contributing to the delinquency of a
minor; and Pacheco and Camapana were federal prisoners.
   Romero said he did not have the charges against Pacheco and
Campana.

   Vietnam's prime minister, in a note of
congratulations to Thailand's new prime minister, expressed hope
for improved relations between the two feuding nations.
   Vietnam's Do Muoi sent the one-sentence note Friday, a day after
Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan was formally installed in
office. A text was carried in an official Vietnam News Agency
report seen in Bangkok Saturday.
   It said: ``I am confident that in your new and high

will build up the relations of friendship, cooperation, and good
neighborliness between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the
Kingdom of Thailand for the interests of the two peoples and for a
friendly, stable and cooperative Southeast Asia.''
   During the Vietnam war, a Thai army division helped support the
U.S.-backed South Vietnam government in its battle against
communist North Vietnam, which won the war in 1975. Thailand backs
guerrillas fighting Vietnamese forces that invaded Cambodia in
December 1978, and Thai and Vietnamese forces frequently clashed
along the Cambodian border until a recent pullback of troops from
the frontier.
   Thailand also has criticized Hanoi for the flow of people
fleeing Vietnam by boat to Thailand.
   Chatichai indicated Thursday that he would ease the tough
position his predecessors had taken on relations with
communist-ruled Indochina.
   ``There will be changes where our neighbors are concerned,'' he
told reporters. ``We want Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia to be our
markets, not our battlefield.''

   Torrential rains flooded 40 villages in north
China and killed at least 21 people, the official Xinhua News
Agency said Saturday.
   Xinhua's brief report said 19 other people were missing
following a 3{-hour deluge Saturday morning in Fenyang County in
Shanxi province.
   About 30,000 people were marooned by the flood waters, and at
least 100 houses were destroyed, it said.
   No details were given on rescue efforts in the latest of a
series of natural disasters to hit China this year.
   Most recent official figures on flash flooding a week ago in
coastal Zhejiang province put the death toll at 256, with 316
people missing.
   More than 500 other people have died throughout China in
separate floods, hailstorms and a typhoon this year, while a heat
wave in June and July claimed nearly 500 lives in central cities.

   The body of a sixth
victim washed ashore Saturday after a boat carrying illegal aliens
bound for Puerto Rico capsized in a storm, a navy spokesman said.
   Capt. Sigfrido Pared Perez said the body of the drowned young
woman washed up on the eastern shore of the Caribbean nation.
   He said private fishing boats have joined the navy in searching
for about 11 other people who disappeared when the boat capsized
Friday three miles from the town of Haina on the eastern shore.
   Eighteen people have been rescued, and six _ four women and two
men _ are known to have drowned, Pared Perez told The Associated
Press.
   The 25-foot wooden boat was carrying about 35 Dominicans.
   The survivors were under arrest in Santo Domingo. Police said
they could be accused of complicity in homocide if they don't tell
authorities who organized the illegal journey.

<HEAD>Six Japanese Women's Passports to be Revoked Before Olympics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The passports of six Japanese women will be revoked
before the Olympics in South Korea because they have been linked to
North Korean spies, a government official said Saturday.
   The Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the government had ``due reasons'' to conclude that
the women, in their 30s and 40s, have had contacts with North
Korean agents operating abroad.
   The Foreign Ministry ordered the six to return their passports
by Aug. 31 to prevent them from engaging in activities that would
``conspicuously and directly damage Japan's interest and
security,'' the official said. He did not elaborate.
   Japan's National Police Agency established an anti-terrorism
team in April to ensure that terrorists do not use Japan as a base
to launch attacks on the Olympic Games, scheduled to begin in Seoul
on Sept. 17.
   The ministry official said one of the six, who was living near
Tokyo, agreed to return her passport. The other five were living
abroad at unknown locations.
   Communist North Korea, capitalist South Korea's bitter rival
since the division of the Korean peninsula after World War II, has
demanded that it be allowed to serve as co-host for the Olympic
Games.
   The International Olympic Committee has rejected the North's
demand, saying the Games are awarded to a single city. North Korea
has said it will boycott the Olympics if it is not allowed to be a
co-host, and South Korea fears its rival will use violence to
disrupt the Games.

<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with authorities saying ammonia leak

controlled, new explanation of different figures on evacuees.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ELSBERRY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twelve cars of a freight train derailed
Saturday and hit chemical and fuel storage tanks, igniting a
nine-hour fire, releasing hazardous gas and displacing about 600
residents, authorities said.
   Four firefighters suffered minor injuries in the fire, said Troy
Fire Chief Gerald Cherry, a spokesman for the authorities involved.
   A 15-square-block downtown area in this eastern Missouri town
remained evacuated 14 hours after the accident, which occurred
around 6 a.m., he said.
   Several rail cars hit a diesel tank, puncturing it and allowing
diesel fuel to spill, Cherry said. The fuel and several rail cars
carrying lumber products and piping were engulfed in flames.
   Cherry said the fire at the Lincoln County Agricultural Co-op
was dangerously close to 28,000 gallons of diesel, kerosene and
gasoline being stored. He said a bulk fertilizer plant also was
nearby.
   Throughout the evening, highway traffic was routed around the
town of about 1,900 people about 50 miles northwest of St. Louis.
   The fire was brought under control shortly after 3 p.m., but
residents were not expected to be allowed back to their homes until
early Sunday because of anhydrous ammonia gas leaking from a
punctured tank, Cherry said.
   He said authorities hoped to pump the anhydrous ammonia, a
liquid that becomes a gas when it is released into the air, out of
the storage tank and haul it away.
   The gas is not highly flammable but is dangerous to respiratory
systems and can cause severe burns, Cherry said, explaining why
authorities evacuated at least 200 residents and kept a total of
about 600 from returning to their homes.
   He said the tank that was punctured had a 20,000-gallon
capacity, but contained only between 4,000 and 6,000 gallons of
anhydrous ammonia. Coincidentally, he said, the railroad car that
punctured the tank was also carrying anhydrous ammonia.
   That car was not damaged, but was to be the last of the derailed
cars to be righted, he said.
   The 113-car train had been southbound from Galesburg, Ill., to
St. Louis, said Burlington Northern Railroad spokesman Brian
Sweeney.
   Cherry said about 150 firefighters, including some from as far
away as St. Louis, helped fight the fire with foam and water after
letting it burn itself down for several hours.
   A clean-up crew and investigators were on the scene, Sweeney
said. The cause of the derailment had not been determined.
   The evacuees were taken to a church and a school.

<TEXT>
   A man charged with rape was acquitted after
his accuser testified while intoxicated, and a prosecutor said he
wants to review the case to see if the judge acted properly.
   Attorneys said Circuit Judge J.C. Norton refused to look at the
results of a blood-alcohol test given to the alleged victim before
she testified.
   The judge later said he was shocked any lawyer would allow an
intoxicated witness to testify.
   Reached at home Saturday night, Norton declined to discuss the
case. ``I don't think it would be appropriate to comment on it,''
he said.
   District Attorney Roy Johnson said he has ordered a transcript
to review what Norton said to the jury hearing the case against
Henry Gray.
   ``The woman's drinking had been brought to the court's attention
before trial,'' said Johnson. ``If (Norton) did anything improper,
we will take whatever action is necessary.''
   Gray was found innocent Thursday, a day after the woman
testified.
   A defense attorney smelled alcohol on the woman's breath and
requested a test to determine whether she had been drinking. The
test showed her to have a blood-alcohol content of 0.16 percent,
while the legal presumption of intoxication in Alabama is a reading
of 0.10 percent.
   Defense attorney Collins Pettaway said Norton told prosecutors
before the trial he did not want to see any test results ``until
they were properly presented.''
   After the verdict of innocent was read, Pettaway said Norton
told jurors he might have overruled a guilty verdict because of
information about the woman's drinking.

   About 400 people Saturday marched and
held a prayer vigil to protest the acquittal of three white lawmen
in the beating death of a black man jailed on drunken driving
charges.
   The lawmen had been charged with violating the civil rights of
Loyal Garner Jr., whose Dec. 27 death sparked charges of racism in
this East Texas town.
   Those who converged on Hemphill Saturday staged a march to the
Sabine County courthouse, where several people gave speeches
blasting what they called a lack of justice in Garner's death.
   ``I want the men that did it to be convicted, found guilty as
they should be,'' Garner's widow, Corrine, said.
   Members from various NAACP groups in Texas, Arkansas and
Louisiana planned the march and demonstration. There were no
arrests or incidents related to the march, Sabine County sheriff's
officials said.
   Vollie Grace, president of the local National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, said demonstrators also joined
in a prayer vigil.
   Acquitted last month were Hemphill Police Chief Thomas Ladner,
41, and Sabine County sheriff's deputies James ``Bo'' Hyden, 35,
and Bill Horton, 58.
   Garner, 34, who was arrested Christmas Day for suspicion of
drunken driving, died of head injuries.
   The three lawmen still face murder charges.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Iraq's announcement Saturday that it will accept a conditional
cease-fire with Iran is ``a very important step forward'' for
stalled U.N. peace efforts, and he hoped to declare a truce early
this week.
   ``I received information from the foreign minister of Iraq that
his president has decided to accept an immediate cease-fire
followed by direct talks under my auspices,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   ``I think this is a very important step forward,'' said Perez de
Cuellar. ``The impression I have is that it can solve the problem.''
   But Iran gave no official reaction on President Saddam Hussein's
call to accept a cease-fire if Iran agrees to immediate direct
talks.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati met the U.N. chief
for more than an hour and was presented the Iraqi proposal. Later,
he brushed past reporters without comment.
   In a Saturday night interview with Cable News Network, Javad
Zarif, counselor to Iran's U.N. Mission, reinterated Iran's stand
``to engage in direct talks immediately following a cease-fire ...
within the appropriate framework of the U.N. plan.'' Zarif did not
elaborate.
   Perez de Cuellar said he would meet Velayati Sunday to receive
Iran's formal response to the Iraqi proposal.
   ``I think we are on the way to a final solution of the problem,
with the full implementation of Resolution 598,'' he said after
talks with Velayati. The U.N. resolution calls for an immediate
cease-fire, then a troop withdrawal to international borders and a
prisoner exchange.
   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Ismat Kittani, met the secretary-general
first to brief him on Hussein's proposal.
   After the meeting, Kittani said: ``If they (the Iranians) accept
this, we are on the road to peace. If they refuse it, then it will
be obvious to everyone that Iran and Iran alone is responsible for
shedding any additional blood.''
   Hussein's dropping of his demand for direct talks before a
cease-fire represented acceptance of Perez de Cuellar's compromise
plan to break the deadlock, according to diplomats who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Peres de Cuellar said Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz was
summoned home Saturday for consultations but would return ``as soon
as I tell him I am ready to initiate the direct talks.''
   ``I hope that I will be in a position'' early this week to
announce the beginning of a cease-fire to end the 8-year-old
Persian Gulf war and other elements of a U.N. peace plan, he said.
   One Middle Eastern diplomat familiar with the talks, speaking by
telephone, said the Iraqi announcement should give fresh impetus to
U.N. peace efforts.
   He described Hussein's announcement as high drama and artful
diplomacy and said he effectively ``tossed the ball back into
Iran's court.''
   Perez de Cuellar told the Security Council Friday he planned to
dispatch a 250-man U.N. observer team to monitor a cease-fire and
troop withdrawal.
   Middle East diplomats said they expected Iran to welcome the
Iraqi announcement.
   The Iraqi president announced Iraq would observe a cease-fire on
condition that Iran agree to enter into direct talks immediately
after a cease-fire.
   Hussein also said Iran must accept implementation of all aspects
of U.N. Resolution 598.
   Iraq accepted the resolution a year ago. Iran, after a series of
battlefield losses, accepted the resolution in a surprise
announcement last month.
   Iraq had demanded face-to-face talks before a cease-fire as a
way of testing Iran's sincerity following its surprise turnaround.
   Iran rejected the demand, but said such negotiations could be
held ``at an acceptable level'' after a cease-fire, troop
withdrawal and prisoner exchange.
   The secretary-general, attempting to break the stalemate,
proposed that both sides announce they accept both a cease-fire and
direct talks. Then he would announce a cease-fire date and
simultaneously call for early direct talks, according to diplomatic
sources close to the talks.
   Details of the secretary-general's plan have not been disclosed.
   The five permanent members of the Security Council are also
working on a plan to guarantee Iraq that Iran will fully implement
all aspects of a truce. The five are the United States, Britain,
China, France and the Soviet Union.
   U.N. diplomats have said that the combination of the
secretary-general's plan and Security Council guarantees should
remove Iraq's inhibitions about a U.N. peace agreement.

   President Miguel de la Madrid said Friday the
difficult economic prospects facing Third World countries affect
the stability of all nations.
   He spoke at the opening session of a meeting of the Commission
of the South.
   Attending the commission meeting are 28 delegations from
developing countries. After the opening session the representatives
moved to the mountain resort of Cocoyoc for private meetings on
their nations' economic and political problems. The conference will
end Monday.
   De la Madrid said the economic problem for developing countries
``is complicated even more by the onerous service of the foreign
debt and the resistance to solutions that might imply recognition
of coresponsibility and restore the right to development.''
   ``The majority of debtors have managed to avoid confrontations
and unilateral decisions,'' he said.
   Among those attending the conference are former President Julius
K. Nyerere of Tanzania, the commission chairman; former President
Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela and the Cuban vice president,
Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.
   Nyerere, in his opening statement, proposed the debtor nations
organize a forum in which they ``could make more precise ... their
common problems.''
   ``The creditors are strongly organized to defend their
interests,'' he said. ``The debtors aren't organized. Each one
doesn't even appreciate the nature or the magnitude of the problems
of the others.
   ``Because of that, the commission proposes the creation of a
debtors' forum.''
   He also said the commission ``will have to make inevitably a
call for cooperation from the North _ the North that today
dominates as much in economics as it does in politics.''
   The Commission of the South was formed last year in Geneva. It
met in March in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and this is its third
meeting.
   Its declared purpose is to strengthen cooperation among
developing countries and develop the North-South dialogue.

   A vacationing Italian industrialist and his
15-year-old grandson were missing Friday and feared kidnapped in
southern Calabria after their car was found abandoned near the
Ionian coast, police reported.
   The presumed abduction of Alberto Minervini, 58, and his
grandson of that name occurred two days after the release in the
same area of an 8-year-old boy, Marco Fiora, who was held for 17
months by a kidnap gang.
   Police also reported Friday that a leading society figure,
Countess Marta Marzotto, appeared to have been the intended victim
of a kidnapping by six armed and masked bandits who burst into her
vacation villa at Porto Rotondo, Sardinia, on Thursday night.
   Finding the countess was out, the bandits tied up her mother and
two maids and fled, police said.
   Minervini owns a ceramic factory in Portici, near Naples.
   He and his grandson were driving in a tiny Fiat 500 Thursday
night, family members told police. The car was found pulled to the
side of a road with lights on and motor running.
   More than 200 policemen aided by tracker dogs and helicopter
surveillance searched for the two in the rugged countryside and
mountains but found no trace, police said. The car was found six
miles from the spot where Marco Fiora was released.
   Police said Thursday they arrested eight people in that
abduction, which they believe was carried out by the 'Ndrangheta,
the Calabrian version of the Mafia.
   The kidnappers demanded a ransom of 5 billion lire (about $4
million) but the family paid only an initial installment of 285
million lire ($220,000), police said.

for the first seven months of 1988 at 177.9 percent, the National
Institute of Statistics reported Friday.
   Two days ago the government of President Raul Alfonsin adopted
an austerity program with budget cuts, price controls and an 11.4
percent devaluation of the austral, the national currency.
   The austral was introduced in June 1985 to replace the peso. At

   Hurricane Fabio kicked up some high waves before
it was downgraded to tropical storm status and veered away from the
Hawaiian Islands, the National Weather Service said Friday.
   The weakening storm system was 312 miles south of Hawaii Island
on Friday morning, bringing a chance of rain and cloudiness to the
southern tip of the Hawaiian chain, forecaster Clarence Lee said.
   ``The center is so far away, I don't think it will have any
significant impact,'' Lee said.
   The weather service canceled a tropical storm watch for Hawaii
Island on Thursday and canceled a high surf advisory Friday.
   On Friday morning, Fabio had maximum sustained winds of 46 mph,
which the weather service said classified it as a tropical storm. A
storm must sustain winds of 74 mph or more to remain a hurricane.

<HEAD>Don't Make Meese Mistake Again, ABA Chief Tells Dukakis and Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the American Bar Association,
reacting to the troubles of former Attorney General Edwin Meese,
urged U.S. presidential hopefuls Friday to select an attorney
general with the care they would give a Supreme Court nominee.
   Association President Robert MacCrate said in identical letters
to Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis that too
often in the past, presidents have selected ``political friends''
to head the Justice Department.
   ``The care and importance given to the selection of justices of
the Supreme Court should be given as well to the selection of
attorney general,'' he said.
   Addressing a news conference in Toronto, where the bar
association is holding its annual meeting, MacCrate said his
message was prompted by the events of the past 18 months,
culminating in Meese's resignation under a cloud. Meese, a friend
of Reagan, was the subject of a 14-month ethics investigation by an
independent counsel, James McKay. McKay decided against filing
charges but said Meese probably violated conflict-of-interest laws
and willfully filed a false tax return.
   The Reagan administration has nominated former Gov. Richard
Thornburgh of Pennsylvania to replace Meese until the end of the
term.
   MacCrate said Meese was one of many top law officers appointed
through personal connections. He cited Robert Kennedy, attorney
general for his brother John F. Kennedy.
   ``A close connection between partisan politics and the office of
attorney general inevitably reduces the effectiveness of the
department, incites fear about the integrity of the administration
of justice and undermines public confidence in the rule of law,''
said MacCrate, a New York attorney.
   MacCrate acknowledged that the attorney general is in many ways
``the president's lawyer,'' and it's natural that he would choose a
trusted friend.
   He also said the 346,000-member ABA could do more to help ensure
the candidate is qualified.
   Although an ABA standing committee scrutinizes all candidates
for the federal courts, it does not review nominees for attorney
general or other Cabinet posts. ``We should have a machinery to do
it,'' he said.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar will address the
opening assembly of the weeklong annual meeting on Monday. Other
speakers will include CIA Director William H. Webster and former
Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell. About 12,000 U.S. and
Canadian lawyers are expected to attend.

<HEAD>At Least 22 Companies Still Have Policies With Race-Based Premiums</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 22 insurance companies still
have life insurance policies in effect that charge blacks higher
premiums than whites, but most companies responding to a survey
stopped the practice years ago.
   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners questioned
2,806 life insurance companies after the American Civil Liberties
Union asked about racially based premium rates, said David Simmons,
the association's lawyer.
   The Kansas City-based group adopted a resolution in June
criticizing race-based premiums as ``inherently unfair and
unacceptable as a matter of public policy.''
   It asked state regulatory offices to direct companies to
neutralize the race based differentials for policies in effect.
   Of the 2,719 companies responding to the survey by Aug. 1, 52
said they had used race as a basis for differences in life
insurance premiums. Fifty-one of those said they had discontinued
issuing such policies, and one did not answer that question.
   Asked if they were currently collecting premiums that
differentiate based on race, 22 said they were, 27 said they were
not and three did not answer.
   Four of the 22 companies were from Louisiana, three were from
Texas, two each were from Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina
and one was from Nebraska, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Kansas,
Missouri and Georgia, Arizona and Arkansas.
   Most companies that said they had used racially differentiated
premiums said they had discontinued them years ago _ some as far
back as 1912, most in the 1950s and 1960s and the last in 1987.
   New York Life Insurance Co., for example, said it had stopped
using the policies by the end of 1938 in New York, New Jersey,
Connecticut, Ohio, Michigan and Minnesota. It said its records did
not show when the practice was discontinued in other states, but by
the end of 1948 it was no longer using it anywhere.
   Home Beneficial Life Insurance Co. of Virginia said its premium
differences ``reflect differences in published and recognized
mortality statistics'' and it cited population statistics from the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services showing a life
expectancy of 70.6 years for whites born in 1960 and 63.6 years for
blacks.

<TEXT>
   The government on Friday named a leading terrorism
investigator to head its battle against the Mafia and proposed an
expansion of judicial forces to operate in major centers of
organized crime.
   Domenico Sica's appointment as high commissioner came after a
team of anti-Mafia investigating magistrates in Sicily announced
their resignations last week, saying their work was being
obstructed.
   Several judges involved with the magistrates' team also accused
the government of letting the anti-Mafia effort disintegrate
following the conviction of 338 people in a trial of
organized-crime leaders last December.
   Sica, 56, has investigated many of Italy's major terrorism cases
over the past decade including the kidnap-murder of former Premier
Aldo Moro in 1978 and the shooting and wounding of Pope John Paul
II in 1981.
   Sica replaced Pietro Verga ,who retired.
   ``There isn't much difference between terrorism and the Mafia
and therefore ... I approach my new job with calm and integrity,''
Sica told reporters.
   At Friday's Cabinet meeting, Interior Minister Antonio Gava
proposed the government either create a new intelligence agency to
aid in fighting organized crime or increase the powers of the high
commissioner, Sica.
   Gava also proposed reorganizing the detective force in the
Sicilian capital of Palermo; establishing judicial investigation
squads linked to police stations in Palermo; increasing the powers
of internal revenue agents and creating a special crime-fighting
center in Catania, Sicily.
   The proposals are to be presented to parliamentary commissions.
   Criticism of the government's actions against organized crime
has increased since mid-July when a prominent Sicilian prosecutor,
Paolo Borsellino, said probes by the ``anti-Mafia pool'' of
investigating magistrates in Palermo were being obstructed.
   President Francesco Cossiga called on the interior and justice
ministries and the Superior Council of Magistrates, which oversees
Italian judges, to investigate.
   As the council began hearings last week Giovanni Falcone, the
most famed member of the ``anti-Mafia pool,'' submitted his
resignation and asked for a transfer. The other members of the
group then announced their resignations.
   Falcone said a new chief investigating magistrate, Antonino
Meli, had dispersed the pool and detectives were not cooperating
with the magistrates. But the Council of Magistrates backed Meli.
   ``When men like Falcone and Borsellino talk about leaving their
posts there is a sensation of fear and loss,'' Palermo Mayor
Leoluca Orlando told a news conference this week. He said the post
of high commissioner had turned into a bureaucratic job.
   Sica gained fame for tracking down and prosecuting leftist Red
Brigades terrorists, including those who killed Moro.
   He also investigated Propaganda Due, the right-wing organization
accused of trying to overthrow the government in the early 1980s.
   In Italy's legal system some judges adjudicate court cases, some
are public prosecutors and others investigate crimes with the aid
of police units.

   A jet fighter crashed into a southern
Ohio forest during training exercises Friday, killing an Ohio Air
National Guard pilot, authorities said.
   The plane, an A-7D Corsair II attack fighter, crashed and burned
in Pike State Forest, about 15 miles south of Hillsboro, officials
said.
   The pilot was 2nd Lt. Bryan R. Miner, 28, of Reynoldsburg near
Columbus, said Lt. Jim Boling, a spokesman for Rickenbacker Air
National Guard Base in Columbus.
   Miner's plane was one of three planes that took off from
Rickenbacker Friday morning, Boling said. The fighters were in an
air combat tactics training session in a restricted military area
about 70 miles south of Columbus when the crash occurred.
   Boling said a team of Air Force officers will investigate the
crash.
   Robert Ross, whose home is less than a mile from the crash site,
said he went into the area and saw debris all over a hill and saw a
crater more than six feet deep caused by the crash.
   ``There are pieces scattered all over that place,'' Ross said.

   British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher left Australia on Saturday after a visit marked by
protests of Irish Republican Army sympathizers and homosexual
rights activists.
   Mrs. Thatcher was the first British leader to make an official
visit to Australia in 30 years. She traveled widely on her six-day
tour and held discussions with Prime Minister Bob Hawke.
   On her trip, Mrs. Thatcher warned Australians not to support the
IRA, which is fighting to force the British from the province of
Northern Ireland.
   Six pro-IRA demonstrators held a meeting outside Mrs. Thatcher's
Brisbane hotel Saturday before she left. Police reported no
violence or arrests.
   On Friday, the Conservative leader was greeted in Brisbane by
about 30 protesters from the Australian Aid for Ireland group.
Homosexual rights activists also brandished banners.
   Mrs. Thatcher was scheduled to visit Malaysia and Thailand
before returning to Britain.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. anti-narcotics official said Friday a
herbicide is the best way to destroy the coca crop and control
cocaine trafficking, but the chemical needs more testing before it
can be used.
   Ann Wrobleski, assistant secretary of state for international
narcotics matters, said Peru's government will decide whether to
use the herbicide following studies now underway in the eastern
jungle.
   President Alan Garcia on Thursday questioned the safety to
humans and plants of the chemical tebuthiuron, commercially sold as
Spike. He called for more extensive testing.
   U.S. and Peruvian governments are experimenting with the
herbicide on a one-acre test plot near Tingo Maria, 230 miles
northeast of Lima. About 60 percent of the world's coca, the raw
material of cocaine, is grown in the region.
   Anti-drug officials say manual eradication of coca plants and
programs to encourage peasants to substitute other crops for the
lucrative coca leaves have not been effective.
   ``The use of a safe and effective herbicide is the best way to
get a grip on the drug problem,'' Ms. Wrobleski said during a news
conference. She is touring five South American nations and will
meet with Secretary of State George P. Shultz Monday in Bolivia.
   The herbicide's manufacturer, Eli Lilly & Co. of Indianapolis,
has refused to sell the product for use against coca plants in
Peru, citing ``policy and practical considerations.''
   The herbicide is used in the United States but some Peruvian and
foreign environmentalists have said it would damage the jungle
region's ecological system.
   Most of the coca leaves grown in Peru are processed into cocaine
base and then flown from clandestine airstrips to Colombia, where
the base is refined into cocaine for sale in U.S. and European
markets.

   The report referred to mounting evidence of an
erosion of moral values in society, particularly in the past 20
years, and called it ``a real and present danger.''
   You have heard such statements before, but probably not from a
group of this sort, which calls itself the Committee on Developing
American Capitalism, made up of influential capitalists and
academics.
   Can business be profitable and ethical, the report asks? It can
and must, the group says, or self-respect, business and other
institutions, and freedom and democratic principles will be lost.
   Leo R. Futia, Walter E. Hoadley and John Winthrop Wright signed
the statement. Futia is former chairman of Guardian Life Insurance;
Hoadley, former Bank of America executive vice president; and
Wright, chairman of Wright Investors' Service in Bridgeport, Conn.,
and former manufacturer and academic.
   They ask you to consider the startling findings of a survey of
Fortune 500 companies conducted by Professor Amitai Etzioni, a
committee member. Among his findings were these:
   _Between 1975 and 1984, more than 300 of the Fortune 500
companies were involved in one or more illegal incidents.
   _The top 100 companies were involved in more incidents, 55
percent, than all the others combined.
   _``These offenses occurred during a period of unparalleled
prosperity and were perpetrated by businessmen in leadership
positions possessing wealth, power and influence.
   ``Virtually every episode of corruption cited builds daunting
evidence that its root causes are uncontrolled human greed and lust
for fame and power,'' the group's statement said.
   They contend that ``expedience has become a more compelling
force in the marketplace than law and ethics,'' and they warn:
   ``This sows the seeds of distrust and hatred among neighbors,
between employer and employees, between voters and their elected
officials and between business and government.
   ``In the extreme, it opens the door of government to anarchy.''
   The mounting evidence the authors refer to includes illegal
political contributions, bribes, cheating on defense contracts,
money laundering by bankers, check kiting on Wall Street, insider
trading, fraud, payroll padding.
   They cite evidence in other institutions as well, including
religion and education. But as capitalists and members of the
committee, based at Fairfield University, they are primarily
concerned with refining and restating principles of American
capitalism, and focusing them on the nation's key issues.
   They question the notion, supported by many, that the impression
of moral bankruptcy is created by the media and its ability to
spread news globally, and that corrupt and unethical behavior is no
greater than in the past.
   It is at this point that they express the opinion that mounting
evidence suggests moral values have indeed declined.
   As their report was being distributed, the New York Times on one
day, Aug. 5, carried these stories on its front page:
   _``Biaggi Convicted In Wedtech Case; Simon Also Guilty.''
   _``Hertz Admits Use of Fraud In Bills For Auto Repairs.''
   _``10 Are Indicted In Major Fraud On Blood Tests.''
   _``6 Charged With Racketeering In Wall Street Insider Inquiry.''
   _``Company Shuts In Fraud Case.''
   The page contained only three other stories.
   Shocked by such evidence, many graduate schools of business have
instituted course on ethics, the notion being that moral values can
be applied like a lacquer to provide the product, a graduating
student, a finished look.
   They suggest the remedy must be more fundamental, and that it
might take time. They list several possible explanations for the
sense of moral decay, one of them not often cited by representives
of capitalism.
   It is, they say, ``our affluent society, and the `now' culture
which focuses on self-gratification and substitutes self-indulgence
for personal responsiblity and self-restraint.''
   Training, they suggest, begins in the family, and the American
family, they observe, is itself broken down by ``a lifestyle that
says, `me first.'''

<HEAD>Theaters Feel the Pinch of Shrinking Subsidy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nottingham Playhouse did big business last
year with Agatha Christie's ever-popular ``... And Then There Were
None,'' hardly the gritty social realism that made its reputation
in the 1960s.
   The Royal Shakespeare Company, better known for its ``Hamlet''
and ``King Lear,'' has had to brush up its Shakespeare with Cole
Porter's musical ``Kiss Me, Kate.''
   Such forays into lower-brow fare may horrify the purists, but
Britain's government-funded theaters say they have little choice,
given rising production costs and the hostility of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government toward subsidizing the
arts.
   The new mood was set last year by Arts Minister Richard Luce
when he declared: ``It's time the arts world got rid of its
welfare-state mentality.''
   The notion of taxpayers' money funding the arts has been
sacrosanct since World War II. This year the state is giving $690
million to the arts, about one-third of it to theaters through the
quasi-governmental Arts Council.
   But some critics suggest the erosion of subsidy means an erosion
of quality. They point to the RSC's embarrassment over ``Carrie,''
its $7 million musical that flopped on Broadway after a short run
at Stratford in February.
   Some argue that the theater handsomely repays the government's
investment. Peter Hall, artistic director of the National Theater,
said last year: ``It is simply daft economics, let alone daft
culture, to apply a dogmatic view that subsidy is sick and bad.
   ``I don't believe the arts cost Britain a penny,'' he said. ``It
has not occurred to the current government that the arts is one of
the few absolute success stories of Britain since the War.''
   The Policy Studies Institute, a non-profit research group,
published a recent study showing that the arts are a $17
billion-a-year sector of the British economy, and that one-fourth
of tourist income is spent on cultural activity.
   It said the arts account for 2.5 percent of all spending on
goods and services in Britain and directly employ 496,000 people,
or 2.1 percent of the work force.
   But theater insiders concede that the subsidies battle is lost
and greater concessions to commercialism are inevitable.
   Some even find it desirable. ``It behooves us to go out and make
our money from time to time and to have that commercial hard
knack,'' Terry Hands, artistic director of the RSC and director of
``Carrie,'' said recently in an interview with The Guardian
newspaper.
   The RSC faced a $1.89 million deficit last year and briefly
considered closing its Stratford base. It was rescued largely by a
$2.55 million grant from the Royal Insurance Company and by the
commercial success of ``Les Miserables,'' the Tony award-winning
musical based on Victor Hugo's 1862 novel.
   ``Les Miserables,'' a hit here and on Broadway, is bringing the
company up to $1.7 million a year in worldwide royalties.
   In London, Christopher Hampton's long-running ``Les Liaisons
Dangereuses'' has been netting the RSC $260,000 a year since it
began an open-ended commercial run in October 1986.
   With profits of up to $500,000 from ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' and a
$344,000 fee for the ill-fated ``Carrie,'' even its less
commercially successful ventures have brought the RSC some cash.
   Still, the RSC is not alone in its new bout with commercialism.
   The National Theater, the country's other major subsidized
company, has been playing safe with such Broadway plays as Neil
Simon's ``Brighton Beach Memoirs'' and Brian Clark's ``The
Petition,'' and undemanding revivals such as Arthur Wing Pinero's
``The Magistrate'' and George Abbott and John Cecil Holm's ``Three
Men on a Horse.''
   The National says 52 percent of its annual turnover is now
self-earned. Since 1985, it says, its subsidy of over $12 million
has fallen by over $3.5 million in real terms.
   The Nottingham Playhouse, which began in 1963 producing such
offbeat plays as Frank Wedekind's ``Lulu'' and Peter Barnes' ``The
Ruling Class,'' now leans heavily toward Agatha Christie and
farces, such as ``Fur Coat and No Knickers,'' to keep costs down
and audiences up.
   Some theaters have come up with novel ways to make ends meet.
   The Crucible Theater in Sheffield rented out its auditorium for
a billiards championship so it could go on financing rarely seen
classics and daring new material.
   ``It's the weird situation of buildings built on one philosophy
having to survive in a society operating on another philosophy,''
said Clare Venables, the Crucible's artistic director, in an
interview.
   The Crucible is one of many playhouses built in provincial
cities in the 1960s when the prevailing social philosophy held that
the state had a duty to foster the arts.
   ``The aspirations of the '60s look sick today,'' wrote Paul
Allen in The New Statesman. The arts, he said, are ``regarded with
something surprisingly akin to hatred ... in the new, sourer
political climate.''
   The National's Hall agreed: ``There's a feeling now in the
subsidized sector, and I speak not for myself but for my
colleagues, that we are simply not wanted.
   ``They wish we would just go away so they could turn the whole
thing into the American model. That would be a disaster.''
   Commercial sponsorship is relatively new in Britain and viewed
with some suspicion. But theaters are learning to live with it.
   The RSC's press releases say ``sponsored by Royal Insurance.''
Recent theater programs at the National emblazoned the logos of
Citicorp@Citibank and Ladbroke Group Plc over such classics as
``The Threepenny Opera'' and ``Antony and Cleopatra.''
   But sponsorship has its limitations. Earlier this year, the
National lost an unnamed backer for a revival of John Ford's 1633
``'Tis Pity She's a Whore'' because the firm balked at the title,
and ended up financing the production from its own funds.
   ``What we're talking about is creative life depending on
sponsorship, rather than being something that sprang from a
community activity,'' says Patsy Silburn, chairwoman of the East
Midlands branch of the Arts Council.
   ``There are fewer and fewer places where one could say with any
conviction there's a vibrant and dynamic theater.''

   ``Glasnost'' has come _ or
returned _ to Czechoslovakian art with the first freewheeling
exhibit by hundreds of artists held in Prague since 1969.
   Twenty-five thousand people filed past more than 2,700 works by
882 artists in the first two weeks of the ``Prague salon'' staged
at a city stadium and in the Park of Culture and Recreation.
   Following demands for such a show at a meeting last year of the
state-run Union of Artists, the salon is free of the rigid
restrictions imposed on most art exhibits since the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms of 1968 were crushed.
   Picking up on a tradition started with a salon in 1968 but
abandoned after 1969, works are shown in alphabetical order. Each
artist gets the same space, regardless of rank, and is free to fill
it with any work completed in the last five years.
   The result is a chaotic mix of abstract, expressionist and
surrealist styles competing side-by-side for the visitors'
attention.
   Despite the freedom, however, there is no explosion of
previously unknown talent.
   Nonetheless, some artists make bold steps into the political
sphere. Premysl Vanicek, for example, hung a kitsch portrait of
Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev close to a portrait in identical style
of Franz Kafka, the author whose full works are still unpublished
in his native Prague.
   Another picture, by Vaclav Sramek, consists entirely of the
letters P and A and is entitled ``Perestroika, A Variation on
Somebody Else's Theme'' _ a possible allusion to the similarity
between Gorbachev's reforms and those introduced in Czechoslovakia
in 1968 by Alexander Dubcek.
   Elsewhere in the exhibit, Olga Berekova displays a portrait of
Pope John Paul II, while rock star Mick Jagger graces the sculpture
section.
   The exhibit is limited to members and candidates of the Artists'
Union. In the past, the union was often accused of giving
preferential treatment to some members and failing to promote young
artists who have a chance to show at the salon.
   One idea behind the present exhibit seems to have been an
official desire to show that the alleged restrictions were not
preventing great young talents from coming forward.
   ``Gone is the era when so-called forbidden fruit tasted good
just because it had the odor of something forbidden, unwelcome and
outlawed,'' the political and arts weekly Tvorba said.
   ``The possibility of such a broad exhibition ... prevents the
birth of wronged artists and even martyrs because of an insensitive
and entirely unnecessary administrative intervention. All were
given the same chance and only the future will show who will win.''
   Official support for the salon went all the way up to Communist
Party leader Milos Jakes, who praised it as a chance for artists to
compare works.
   But not everybody was so enthusiastic. Czechoslovakia's graphic
artists, highly ranked internationally, did not take part, and not
one professor from the Academy of Arts chose to display works.
   The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo chafed at the low standard
of many works shown and took issue with at least one sculpture,
criticizing a torn chaise longue with a figure made out of tree
fungi as a work that had nothing to do with contemporary art.
   The exhibit was preceded by a handful of much smaller shows that
were tolerated but not officially sponsored in Prague last year.
   The Soviet drive for glasnost, or openness, in the arts and
state-run media has produced nothing like the outstandingly frank
films, plays and articles now seen in Moscow. But a few previously
banned films have been shown and the media has printed articles on
previously taboo topics such as drug addiction and prostitution.

<HEAD>Analyst: Drought Led to `Hype and Sophistry' About Greenhouse
Effect</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on general news wires.</NOTE>

   This summer's drought has focused more
attention on the ``greenhouse effect,'' but an agricultural analyst
says it's impossible to predict whether the Grain Belt will be
among the early losers from a global warming.
   In an article published by Resources for the Future and the
National Center for Food and Agricultural Policy, Norman J.
Rosenberg also cautions against prematurely adjusting U.S.
agriculture to cope with potential changes in the climate.
   ``One cannot rule out the possibility that some lands now too
arid for cultivation of food crops may indeed become more usable
for these purposes in the future,'' writes Rosenberg, director of
the climate resources program for Resources for the Future, an
independent research and education group.
   ``However, there is no more evidence to support that assumption
than there is to support the idea, popularized by the media, that
productive lands in the U.S. Midwest and Great Plains are certain
to become drier and less productive.''
   Still, Rosenberg strongly suggests that some agricultural
efforts be vigorously continued as precautions against possible
problems. He also says more research is needed to develop
techniques to help farming prepare for the natural ups and downs of
climatic variations.
   ``There is nothing in the predictions of the climate change
community to suggest that we should reduce emphasis on soil and
water conservation programs,'' he writes.
   Rosenberg was a professor of agricultural meteorology and
director of the Center for Agricultural Meteorology and Climatology
at the University of Nebraska before joining the Washington-based
organization last year.
   ``The conservation reserve program and sodbuster provisions are
likely to be needed as much in the future as they are today,'' he
writes.
   ``Conservation of groundwater should be emphasized, especially
in aquifers, like the Ogallalla, that are only slowly rechargeable.
Vast quantities of water in storage may provide a buffer to lessen
the negative impacts of greater aridity in the mid-latitudes of
North America, should climate change occur as some global climate
models suggest.''
   The Ogallala covers portions of Great Plains states from
Nebraska to Texas and is primary source of irrigation for farming.
   In an interview, Rosenberg expressed concerns that the current
drought gripping portions of the Grain Belt has generated ``hype
and sophistry'' about the greenhouse effect _ that increasing
concentrations of carbon dioxide and other gases would cause a
general warming of the atmosphere by trapping heat around the Earth.
   Rosenberg contends the drought shouldn't be blamed on the
greenhouse effect but is a product of natural variations in weather
patterns.
   However, he says the drought should serve as a lesson for policy
makers and as an indicator of the kinds of severe weather changes
that could occur more frequently in the future if the greenhouse
effect manifests itself as some have suggested.
   ``I think the people who are using this year's drought as some
kind of omen of the greenhouse effect are doing us a bit of a
disservice ... because this drought is not at all unprecedented,''
says Rosenberg. ``But the drought does drive home the point that
we're very vulnerable and climate change can make us more
vulnerable.''
   Rosenberg says he is ``reasonably convinced'' that the
greenhouse effect is responsible for the gradual warming trend that
has occurred worldwide. But he says scientists lack the ability to
accurately predict the regional effects of a continuation of that
warming. Past greenhouse effect studies have predicted widely
ranging temperature and precipitation changes.
   For example, a ``state-of-the-art'' study by the Energy
Department in 1985 projected temperature increases for the middle
of North America from 2 degrees to 8 degrees Celsius, depending
upon which scientific model was used by researchers.
   In his article, Rosenberg says there are indicators that
agriculture can adjust to some of the predicted climatic changes.
He points to the expansion of the nation's winter-wheat growing
region since 1920.
   Hard red winter wheat is grown in the northern Plains, including
Montana, where average temperatures are lower, the growing season
shorter and there is less rainfall than traditional areas like
Kansas. That expansion, Rosenberg says, ``has occurred over a
climatic gradient greater in many ways'' than the greenhouse
changes predicted in some studies.
   Still, Rosenberg says the current drought illustrates how modern
agriculture remains extremely vulnerable to weather-related
stresses. He contends that more emphasis should be placed on
research to develop crops and ``techniques that minimize that
vulnerability.''
   That, he says, is the best strategy for agriculture to prepare
for what the greenhouse effect could bring.
   ``Even if the whole greenhouse effect would turn out to be a
misconception, but we had invested a lot more in research to
fortify agriculture against climatic variability, natural
variability, we'd still be coming out ahead,'' says Rosenberg.

<HEAD>`Number Numbness' Afflicts Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock traders seem to have been paying attention
lately to the critics who fault them for overreacting to news
events.
   Rather than gyrating wildly when a government statistic on the
economy comes out higher or lower than expected, the market in
recent days has barely budged.
   In the past week, for example, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials did not rise or fall more than 7.5 points in any single
session.
   Whatever happened to the volatility everybody was so worried
about?
   New Yorkers, at least, are inclined to put the situation down to
the stifling heat and the traditional ``summer doldrums'' that set
in on Wall Street in August.
   But that doesn't serve as a full explanation. It's an
international market these days, and the orders aren't coming in
from London or Tokyo, just as they aren't from Manhattan.
   The idea that everybody is on vacation doesn't wash the way it
used to, either. Money managers at the large institutions that
dominate the modern marketplace are under just as much pressure to
produce results in the third quarter of the year as they are in the
first, second and fourth.
   Jay Donnaruma, an analyst at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.,
has an alternative explanation: ``It's called `number numbness,'''
he says.
   ``Each week there is some government number to be released that
causes the markets to go catatonic before its release, and
paralyzes the markets afterward while the `experts' analyze it.
   ``As a result, no one wants to get caught by the number _ trade
deficit, Consumer Price Index, Producer Price Index, gross national
product _ so millions of folks do nothing simultaneously.''
   Against this background, the Dow Jones industrial average
drifted down 9.60 points to 2,119.13 in the past week.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped .26 to
153.09; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
edged up .38 to 387.71; and the American Stock Exchange market
value index was down 1.23 at 304.95.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 155.81 million shares a day,
against 163.98 million the week before.
   The mood on Wall Street is dominated by fears of revived
inflation. But Jeffrey Applegate and Richard Bernstein, analysts at
Tucker, Anthony & R.L. Day Inc., argue that that concern is
misguided.
   The most important question for the markets, they say, is when
the Federal Reserve and central banks of other leading
industrialized countries will stop tightening credit.
   ``The chief economic risk in this round of tightening is that
central bankers go too far and create a recession,'' they contend.
   ``But the adroit behavior of central banks through this economic
expansion suggests that's unlikely.''
   In the worldwide market crash last fall, Applegate and Bernstein
observe, ``central bankers rushed to throw liquidity into the
system to prevent a financial fissure from becoming an economic
one. It worked.
   ``Central bankers and finance ministers still meet and
telecommunicate often enough to coordinate policy, this time around
to slow economic growth.''
   If restrictive credit policies should create a financial
lightning strike, they say, it is most likely to hit the Tokyo
stock market, which is the only major market that has surpassed its
1987 highs this year.
   ``By any rational valuation yardstick, it is and has been widely
overvalued,'' they say. ``The risk is very high.''

<HEAD>Business Week Leak Scandal Raises Questions About Market Policing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insider trading on stolen stock columns from
Business Week issues has raised troubling questions that go to the
heart of the relationship between financial markets and influential
news reports.
   The Business Week scandal also has focused attention on
widespread ignorance of what insider trading is, despite the wave
of publicity about Wall Street felons such as Ivan Boesky.
   In addition, the scandal illustrates the securities industry's
own problems in detecting and policing suspicious trades, despite
its array of sophisticated surveillance gear.
   Although Business Week has been faulted by some for not
disclosing longtime suspicions of insider trading on the
market-sensitive ``Inside Wall Street'' columns, lawyers agree the
biggest U.S. business weekly bears no legal liability for what
happened and took sincere action to stop the thefts.
   But the magazine's policy of reporting on little-known, thinly
traded stocks, a key element of the scandal, has aroused concern
that Business Week may have been an unwitting accomplice of the
insider traders.
   ``It does make the situation more troubling,'' said Sam Scott
Miller, a securities lawyer in New York. ``But it's always easy to
judge what the right thing to do was after it's clear what was
going on.''
   John Dierdorff, Business Week's managing editor, said in an
interview that the magazine is acutely aware of the potential
impact on prices of offbeat stocks described in ``Inside Wall
Street,'' but has to balance that concern against the news value of
telling readers about interesting situations.
   ``We do not tip stocks,'' Dierdorff said. ``If you actually make
recommendations, you'd have to get yourself a license from one of
the regulatory bodies.''
   The magazine's aim in the column, Dierdorff said, has been and
will be ``to report what some smart guys on Wall Street are doing.''
   Trades in at least two dozen securities firms are under
investigation because of the scandal, in which some employees of
R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co., a company that prints Business Week,
peddled issues to brokers before the magazine reached the public.
   The brokers then bought stocks described in ``Inside Wall
Street,'' and sold them later for profit, after other investors had
read the column and purchased the stocks, thereby inflating the
prices.
   At least seven people have lost their jobs because of alleged
roles in the scandal. Although no charges had been filed by the
weekend, the Securities and Exchange Commission and criminal-law
enforcers in at least two states were known to be involved in
probes of the purloined magazines.
   The use of confidential information to buy and sell stocks is
commonly described as insider trading and is considered a felony
under federal securities laws.
   Two weeks after Business Week revealed the problem, which
editors had suspected in early 1987, the magazine gave the first
detailed accounting of what happened.
   In the latest issue, distributed Friday, Business Week said it
first tried to plug suspected leaks by tightening security
procedures, restricting access to ``Inside Wall Street'' during the
editing process, and reminding printers of the need for
confidentiality. The problem appeared to abate until this spring.
   Editor-In-Chief Stephen Shepard defended the magazine's decision
not to alert the SEC, saying regulators may have demanded
disclosure of confidential news sources as part of any
investigation.
   Moreover, Business Week had no obligation to notify the
commission, in the opinion of its general counsel, Robert N.
Landes. Other lawyers agreed with that opinion, especially since
the magazine had determined none of its staff was implicated.
   ``When you go talk to the cops, the first thing the cops do is
chase the people who reported the incident,'' said Stephen R.
Miller, a securities lawyer at the Philadelphia law firm of Dechert
Price & Rhoads. ``So you're a little wary and want to be sure you
know the guy who did it.''
   As in many insider trading cases, the key to finding the
culprits is abnormal trading of the stocks in question. But even
the most sophisticated technology used to track stock activity does
not reveal more than simple hints.
   Market surveillance computers at the major exchanges are
designed to sound alarms when a stock breaks its historical price
or volume pattern, an aberration called a ``kickout.''
   In the Business Week case, more than two dozen stocks kicked out
over a period of many months and were noticed by surveillance
officials at the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange
and National Association of Securities Dealers, which monitors
over-the-counter trading.
   But these officials said in interviews that patterns of trading
can be extremely difficult to detect, especially if the stocks have
no apparent relationship or the kickouts occur irregularly.
   ``When you see 10 different stocks kicking out at any point in
time, it's not necessarily going to click immediately,'' said Agnes
Gautier, vice president of market surveillance at the NYSE. ``What
you're looking for is a common theme.''
   Even if kickouts are traceable to a column in Business Week or
some other publication, she said, ``Of necessity, you're talking
about time and a number of issues. You have to see that before you
say there's a problem here.''

   Oil futures prices rebounded from a four-day
slump amid reports of a possible resolution to the longstanding
Persian Gulf war.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for September
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude, rose 23 cents a 42-gallon barrel Friday to close at $15.26.
   Refined oil products also gained ground. The September contract
for wholesale heating oil climbed 0.58 cent a gallon to finish at
43.04 cents. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for September increased
0.28 cent a gallon to 45.23 cents.
   Energy prices had declined throughout the week, in part, because
OPEC's pricing committee failed to take any concrete action after
meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland.
   But analysts said technical factors and news the United Nations
was persisting in its efforts to bring about an end to the fighting
between oil-producing Iran and Iraq contributed to Friday's
recovery.
   ``Prices rose early because of the potential for a cease-fire,''
said Andrew Lebow, an oil analyst for E.D.&F. Man International
Futures Inc.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced Thursday
that he had received a report from a U.N. military team that
visited both nations about arrangements for a U.N.-supervised
cease-fire. He said both sides are interested in peace talks.
   The U.N. chief was to meet with the Security Council on Friday
about the report, but would not disclose the contents of the talks.
   A truce in the region could signal higher oil prices if the
13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which
includes Iran and Iraq, can agree on production limits.

<HEAD>Unemployment Registers 5.4 Percent in July</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Unemployment edged up from a 14-year low to register 5.4 percent
in July, but financial markets still wary of higher interest rates
interpreted the report as showing too much economic strength.
   The Labor Department said Friday that a total of 170,000 more
Americans _ 80 percent of them teen-agers _ found themselves out of
work last month as unemployment edged up from a 14-year low reached
in June.
   But the monthly statistics that the financial markets watch more
closely, on nonfarm payroll employment, told a different story.
   Payrolls increased 283,000 in July, and the figure for June was
revised upward to show a gain of 532,000.
   Robust economic growth raises the prospect of increased
inflationary pressures and can give the Federal Reserve fresh cause
to consider tightening credit further.
   Interest rates climbed in the credit markets Friday. The
government's bellwether 30-year bond lost about $7.50 per $1,000
face amount, while its yield rose to 9.12 percent from 9.03 percent.
   On Wall Steet stock prices sagged. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials fell 7.47 to close at 2,119.13.
   Most private analysts had anticipated new, non-farm payroll
growth of only 150,000 to 200,000 jobs in July, normally a slow
month in the labor market.
   Revised numbers for June showed much stronger job creation as
well. Originally June payroll growth was put at 346,000, but based
on new data, the government said Friday it was actually 532,000.
   ``The revision for June plus the strong job growth last month
are pretty healthy signs that the economy will keep growing at a
good pace the rest of this year,'' said Roger Brinner, an economist
for Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass.
   Elsewhere, currency traders embraced the employment data and the
dollar rose. Soybean and energy futures advanced while grain
futures were mixed.

   William M. Agee is returning from corporate exile to head the
big engineering and construction firm Morrison Knudsen Corp. in his
hometown of Boise, Idaho, six years after his ill-fated tenure at
Bendix Corp. crashed to a close.
   The 50-year-old Agee, who led Bendix in a disastrous attempt to
acquire Martin Marietta Corp., was named chairman and chief
executive officer of Morrison Knudsen on Friday, effective
immediately. He has served on the company's board for a total of 11
years.
   His first order of business will be to return the company to
profitability. Morrison Knudsen's earnings have declined from their
1984 peak. The company posted a loss for the first six months of
1988 of $46.7 million, mainly from the divestiture of its real
estate development segment and poor performance in its
ship-building operation.
   Revenue for the first two quarters totaled $948.8 million.
   ``People don't like to see red numbers,'' Agee said at a news
conference in Boise. ``I like to under-promise and over-perform.''
   A complex man described as both warm and quick on the trigger,
Agee enjoyed an enviable rise up the corporate ladder only to
stumble in the tangled fight for Martin Marietta and rumors of a
sexual relationship with another executive.
   Agee entered the business world at Boise Cascade Corp. in 1963,
a graduate of Harvard's prestigious business school. He joined
Bendix's management team in 1971 and took over as chairman and
chief executive officer in 1977.
   In his five years in the executive suite, Agee shifted Bendix's
emphasis from auto parts to electronics and aerospace systems and
boosted annual sales toward the $5 billion mark. His compensation
of about $1 million a year in salary _ with stock options and
deferred pay to match _ helped make him an object of keen interest
in business circles.
   But Agee's alienation of both colleagues and observers began
when he hired and rapidly promoted Mary Cunningham, an MBA holder
from his alma mater. Rumors of a romantic liaison with her boss
forced Cunningham to resign from the vice presidency of stragegic
planning a year later in 1980, although both continue to deny they
had a relationship while she worked at Bendix.
   Together, however, the two had conceived of an aggressive
acquisition stragegy that would culminate in Bendix's dramatic
fight with Martin Marietta in 1982.
   Rather than embrace Agee's buyout offer, Martin Marietta fought
back ferociously. In a textbook example of the risky and expensive
``Pac-Man'' strategy, Martin Marietta responded by snapping up
shares of Bendix in a counter takeover bid.
   Both companies spent millions of dollars buying stakes in each
other without one completing the acquisition before the other.
Ultimately Bendix was acquired by Allied Corp., which is now
Allied-Signal Inc., for nearly $2 billion in early 1983. Martin
Marietta, meanwhile, was left heavily in debt, and a big portion of
its stock also was acquired by Allied-Signal.
   Agee resigned from a short-lived career at Allied to form a
small venture capital and consulting firm in Massachusetts with
Cunningham, whom he had married in 1982.
   At Morrison Knudsen, Agee is taking the reigns from William
Deasy, 51, who will continue as president. Deasy also will return
to the job of chief operating officer, a position he held before
being elevated to chief executive officer.
   ``Morrison Knudsen is a world class company with world class
growth potential,'' he said in a statement. ``My job is to ensure
that we maintain the financial muscle and clear strategic thinking
to realize that potential.''
   Wall Street appeared to sanction the appointment. Morrison
Knudsen stock rose $1.50 a share to close at $43.50 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Cunningham has been running the privately financed Nurturing
Network, which helps middle-class women who are pregnant and
single. The network has expanded to all 50 states, and she likely
will continue her work in Boise.
