   A judge on Friday quashed a subpoena in which a
prosecutor sought to force a prominent medical journal to reveal
the name of a doctor who wrote an anonymous first-person account of
a mercy killing.
   ``We're very pleased with the decision. We think it vindicates
the decision to publish it,'' Kirk Johnson, counsel for the
American Medical Association, which publishes the Journal of the
American Medical Association, said.
   ``We continue to believe that the debate over euthanasia _ which
we oppose _ will help in determining the proper treatment of the
terminally ill,'' added Johnson.
   Terry Levin, a spokesman for Cook County State's Attorney
Richard Daley, said Daley had no immediate comment on whether he
would appeal.
   But in a statement, Daley charged that the journal is
``protecting the identity of a killer who may kill again _ indeed
who may well have already killed again.'' He said the article
``appears to be a confession to murder.''
   Chief Cook County Circuit Judge Richard Fitzgerald ruled the
state's attorney's office failed to prove a crime was committed,
and had not exhausted all other avenues to obtain the information _
as required by the state's free press-law.
   Fitzgerald also said the state's attorney had not demonstrated
the information being sought was essential to the public interest,
another requirement of the Illinois Reporters' Privilege Act.
   The article, ``It's Over, Debbie,'' was published in the Jan. 8
edition of the journal in its regular ``A Piece of My Mind'' column.
   In the article, a doctor described injecting a lethal dose of
morphine into a woman dying of ovarian cancer. He wrote that he did
not know the patient, but was asked to check on her and was moved
by her plea of ``Let's get this over with.''
   AMA officials said they did not verify the account, but believed
it was based on fact. They said the author had requested his name
be withheld. The essay did not indicate where the doctor lived or
where the incident occurred.
   The state's attorney's office served the subpoena in
mid-February and AMA attorneys moved to quash it the following week.
   Dr. George Lundberg, editor of the 105-year-old journal, said he
received unanimous support from the AMA board on his decision to
run the article.
   Lundberg has said he believed the essay describes an actual
event, but noted, ``The account does have enough vagueness to
welcome critical analysis as to whether it happened, or happened in
this way.''
   ``Whether the case is valid or not is irrelevant,'' he added,
``as long as the discussion is purposeful or educational for the
people involved.''
   Between 90 and 100 letters sent to the journal commenting on the
decision to publish were about evenly split.
   The AMA is the nation's largest physician organization, with
about 280,000 members, including about half the doctors in the
United States.

   ``The Milagro Beanfield War'' is a story
of one man's battle for the right to water for his northern New
Mexico fields, but it has a universal theme _ the fight to preserve
a traditional way of life, the author says.
   The story, and the film version produced by Robert Redford and
Moctesuma Esparza that opened Friday, will reinforce people who
oppose the impersonal march of progress, says John Nichols, author
of ``Milagro.''
   ``Yeah, hopefully books like mine or a film like `Milagro' can
... help to create an atmosphere where people struggling at all
levels of society have just a little more on their side,'' the Taos
resident said in a telephone interview.
   Nichols, who won't see the movie until its New Mexico premiere
today, said the story celebrates the fight against the ``fascist,
nihilistic, anti-hero, everybody-out-for-themselves-oriented''
aspects of society.
   The main character, handyman Joe Mondragon, bucks the political
and economic system when he illegally diverts water from a resort
development into his once-abandoned beanfield.
   Such wars have punctuated the modern history of northern New
Mexico. In Nichols' and Redford's view, the buying or stealing of
water and land for commercial enterprises threatens to wipe out the
traditional, subsistence farmers, descendants of Spanish settlers,
by making their simple lifestyle impossible.
   In most of his 19 years in New Mexico, Nichols has embraced and
participated in traditionalist causes.
   In the early 1970s, he lampooned state water officials in
editorial cartoons, designed and distributed protest flyers against
the construction of a dam and researched titles to find out who
really held the land and the power in Taos Valley. In recent years,
the fight has been against a proposed mining slurry reservoir and a
bypass road that is eating up farmland around Taos.
   ``It is not acceptable for progress, American style, to throw
away cultures or human beings; to commit cultural genocide on
anybody that gets in the way,'' Nichols said.
   Nichols expected to be treated well by Redford and Esparza in
their film version of his 1974 novel.
   ``I've always had a real trust for Moctesuma Esparza's and
Redford's instincts. And both of them certainly have a long track
record of real concern and involvement in everything from the
environment to culture, things I believe are important causes,''
said Nichols.
   Redford is well-known for his environmentalist work and Esparza
is a film chronicler of the Hispanic world.
   The New Mexico premiere of the movie will be joined by parades,
art shows, contests, and $100 and $500 receptions to benefit a
sheep and wool cooperative, a private community grant foundation,
an Albuquerque theater group and the legal aid agency of northern
New Mexico.
   ``Obviously, my hope is that once all the glamour and the hoopla
die down over the film, that it will be a loving and compassionate
movie with, you know, important cultural and political points to
make that will endure,'' said Nichols.
   Many residents of Truchas, the mountain village where the film
was shot, got parts in the movie or had other jobs with the
production and will attend a special showing of the film.
   Truchas embraced the film after the project was rebuffed by
residents of Chimayo, a small village about 30 miles northeast of
Santa Fe.
   Redford had approached residents of Chimayo because the town's
old buildings and central plaza were ideal for scenes in the movie.
   But a small group of Chimayosos opposed the project, saying it
would disrupt their lives, and Redford was forced 10 miles upstream
to Truchas.
   Nichols said he was not surprised.
   ``I thought they had every right in the world to protest the
filming in their town, and what's more, the people, the press and
everyone else should have respected that right without question,''
said Nichols. ``Believe me, I think the integrity of the community
is a lot more important than making temporary bucks off a film.''

   A study using ultrasonic heart scans
called echocardiograms has found that people with an enlarged left
side of the heart are two to three times as likely as others to
have a heart attack or stroke, researchers said.
   The defect, called left ventricular hypertrophy, has previously
been associated with congestive heart failure. But this is the
first time it has been identified as an independent risk factor for
strokes and heart attacks, said Dr. William Castelli, who presented
the findings Friday at a meeting of the American Heart Association.
   ``The size of your left ventricle is going to be the price you
pay for high blood pressure and overweight,'' Castelli said. ``That
should be recognized now as a powerful risk factor. It's as
powerful as cholesterol, blood pressure and smoking, and indeed in
the short term it's even slightly more powerful than some of those
traditional risk factors.
   ``It means that person is headed in a big way for heart attack
or stroke,'' he said.
   The left ventricle is the main pumping chamber that sends blood
through the body's arteries. The mass of the ventricle _
representing both its size and the thickness of the muscle _ is
what is correlated with increased risk.
   Castelli is the director of the Framingham Heart Study in
Framingham, Mass., one of the nation's longest-running and most
influential studies of heart disease. The identification of the
risk associated with left ventricle enlargement was made by
following Framingham residents for a long period of time while
monitoring their heart size with echocardiography.
   In that technique, ultrasonic sound waves bounced off the heart
are used to produce a picture of the heart, much as sonar provides
a picture of the sea floor.
   Those with an enlarged left ventricle faced double or triple the
risk of heart attacks and strokes, depending upon their age and
their other risk factors, Castelli said.
   ``It gives us another guide to treatment, to aggressive
management of the patient,'' said Dr. Jerome Cohen of St. Louis
University Medical School. ``We can't treat left ventricular mass,
but we can be more aggressive about looking for factors that
contribute to it.''
   Castelli said left ventricle enlargement shows up much more
commonly in echocardiograms than it does in the more conventional
electrocardiograms, which record electrical pulses from the heart
and can be used to identify abnormalities.
   ``There's been very little information out on echocardiography
demonstrating risk,'' said Dr. Philip Liebson of Rush Medical
College in Chicago. ``This is a first step, but it's an important
step.''
   However, echocardiographic determination of left ventricular
mass requires care, Liebson said. ``The technician has to be well
trained,'' he said. ``It's not routine like electrocardiography.''
   Furthermore, 10 percent to 20 percent of people won't get
accurate results from echocardiography, Liebson said.
   Nevertheless, in people with high blood pressure,
echocardiography identifies an enlarged left ventricle three to
five times as often, he said.
   Echocardiography, which was incorporated into the Framingham
study in 1979, is widely available around the United States,
Castelli said. A thorough echocardiographic examination takes about
an hour and costs between $275 and $375, he said.
   Echocardiograms should probably be done in people with high
blood pressure or those who are overweight, he said, to see whether
their left ventricles are enlarged and therefore whether they face
imminent risk of a heart attack.
   Those with enlarged left ventricles should be treated
aggressively to lower blood pressure and lose weight, Castelli said.
   ``This should encourage the doctor really to set rigid goals and
attain them,'' he said.

<HEAD>Clear Days Fewer in Dallas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a clear day in Dallas, you can't see forever.
   In fact clear days in Dallas are becoming about as scarce as
construction cranes.
   A study released Friday by federal and state air pollution
experts shows that visibility of 15 miles or greater has fallen
from about 320 days a year in 1950 to 70 in 1986. The study was
prompted by the apparent deterioration in the city's air in recent
years.
   The pollution that drapes the city's skyline has two forms: the
brown cloud phenomenon, a locally produced effect that usually
occurs in the winter, and a white haze phenomenon, which drifts in
from industries elsewhere in the state year-round.
   The cloud and the haze are equally effective in obscuring the
city's vistas, officials say. But their health effects, if any,
aren't clear.
   ``We do not feel there is an acute health effect,'' said William
Hathaway, director of the air, pesticides, and toxics division of
the regional Environmental Protection Agency. ``Long term, we do
not know.''
   Scientists with the EPA, Texas Air Control Board, and Sandia
National Laboratories of Albuquerque, N.M., said the brown cloud
contains pollution from vehicles, particularly those with diesel
engines, and from wood burning.
   The cloud appears on calm, cold mornings and often completely
obscures the city from a distance of 12 miles.
   About 70 percent of the vehicle pollution in the brown cloud
comes from diesel trucks and cars, although diesel engines account
for a small fraction of the vehicles, according to the report. ``A
diesel vehicle is the equivalent of 25 cars as far as emissions,''
said Wayne Einfield, of the Sandia National Laboratories.
   Hathaway said the EPA will require manufacturers to install
controls on diesel emissions on cars and pickup trucks beginning
next year. He also said his agency is working on converting city
bus systems from diesel to natural gas or methane fuel, and perhaps
will eliminate diesel buses in 10 to 12 years.
   He said the brown cloud also could be reduced by restricting
wood burning, as has been done in Denver. That would have to be
decided by city officials.
   The white haze is most noticeable when winds prevail from the
south and east, Hathaway said. It is composed mostly of sulfate
aerosols that probably come from coal- and lignite-fueled power
plants in East Texas and petroleum industry operations on the Gulf
Coast.
   As the results of the study, which ran from December 1986 to
March 1987, became evident, Hathaway said he began to review
emission levels from these plants, but has found no violations. He
declined to say whether he thought existing standards are adequate.
   Neither the cloud nor the haze are unique to Dallas, officials
said, but the nature of the two phenomena gives the city little
relief. If the still, cold conditions which produce the brown cloud
aren't prevailing, the white haze usually blows in from the south
and east, they said.

   A ``bill of rights'' approved by the Senate
Finance Committee aims at improving the odds for taxpayers who find
themselves in trouble with the IRS.
   But the committee, fearing the original version of the
legislation was so restrictive that tax collections might suffer,
watered down the bill significantly before approving it without
dissent on Friday. Its future is still in doubt because of
opposition from the Reagan administration and some members of the
House Ways and Means Committee.
   Even after being weakened, the measure would require greater
notice before the Internal Revenue Service seizes taxpayers'
property; prohibit imposition of penalties that result from faulty
written advice from the IRS; and formally bar the agency from
requiring employees to meet a collection quota in order to win
promotion.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chief author of the bill, said he has
received 11,000 letters from disgruntled taxpayers since raising
the issue. One that he read aloud while the bill was being debated
asked simply: ``Please put me in contact with a human being at the
IRS.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the committee, said ``a
bully mentality'' infects parts of the IRS. ``This bill is not an
attempt to bash the IRS ... but to protect taxpayers from
heavy-handed abuse,'' he said.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., recalling abuses of
taxpayer privacy during the Johnson and Nixon administrations,
asked IRS Chief Counsel William Nelson whether officials of the
Reagan White House have pressured the agency for political purposes.
   ``They are afraid to even speak to us on the street ...,''
Nelson replied. ``But on several occasions members of Congress have
given us names of individuals or groups and asked us to
investigate.''
   He said the IRS does not audit a taxpayer just because a member
of Congress makes the request, and the agency ``would scream
loudly'' if the White House made such a demand.
   The legislation is considerably weaker than when it was
introduced early last year. Dropped from the original were a
requirement that the IRS carry the burden of proving that its tax
assessments were wrong; a directive that taxpayers be given
Miranda-type readings of their legal rights anytime they are called
before the IRS; and a vast increase in the value of income and
property that would be exempt from IRS seizure.
   Key provisions of the committee-approved bill would:
   _Prohibit the IRS from judging employees on the basis of how
much tax they collect. This would write into law an IRS policy that
agents say is violated in some areas of the country.
   _Require the IRS to waive any penalty imposed because of a tax
underpayment that was caused by erroneous written IRS advice. The
IRS generally follows such a rule. This change would not affect a
taxpayer who asks IRS for advice by telephone; neither would it
allow the waiver of interest charges on any late payment.
   _Increase from 10 days to 30 days the advance written notice the
IRS generally must give a taxpayer before seizing property.
   _Allow the IRS ombudsman, or consumer advocate, to issue orders
stopping the agency from acting against a taxpayer about to suffer
unnecessary and significant loss if the IRS failed to carry out its
duties under the law.
   _Require the IRS to explain in detail how any interest or
penalties attached to a notice of tax deficiency were arrived at.
   _Allow a taxpayer to sue the IRS and recover litigation costs
and at least $100 for each day the agency wrongfully fails to
remove a claim from the taxpayer's property.
   _Permit a taxpayer who defeats the IRS to recover attorneys'
fees unless the IRS could prove it had substantial justification
for its position.

<TEXT>
   Designers Karl Lagerfeld and Jean-Paul Gaultier _
at opposite poles in the fashion world _ have thrown out the
miniskirt in favor of longer skirts in their winter ready-to-wear
shows.
   Lagerfeld's graceful collection drew inspiration from the Middle
Ages as he softened everything from shoulders on down. His
historical touches at Friday's show were subtle and looked like
clothes rather than costumes.
   From Robin Hood hats and swirling capes to Empire dresses, the
elegant clothes were often in grey, black and white.
   The pants were very wide or as narrow as tights, worn with white
sweaters, pearl chokers, beaded necklaces and elaborate
cummerbunds. Others were topped by bright quilted jackets.
   Lagerfeld also showed flaring pyramid coats and full pleated
skirts cut to the knee rather than mid-calf.
   To temper the lean sweater-dresses, Lagerfeld exhibited some
puffball coats of Mongolian lamb.
   Dinner dresses with clinging tops and flowered silk skirts
topped by tulle were graceful. And the high-waisted Renaissance
dresses in black velvet and white silk with their scalloped edges
were romantic enough for any Juliet.
   Lagerfeld black Chantilly sheath enveloped in a cloud of tulle
makes an appealing change from bows, bustiers and ruffles seen so
often recently.
   Gaultier, once the rogue designer of wild shapes, has toned down
to very soft fabrics and wearable silhouettes. The clothes were
topped by knit beanies with pompons for a flippy note.
   His long, loose coats with gold buttons and capes came out in
sober dark tones. But olive, cinnamon, bordeaux and dusty yellow
added a little color.
   The only day dresses at Gaultier were pleated long pinafores,
for a yuppie who wants to look like a maid.
   Chloe's show, with the clothes designed by Martine Sitbon, was a
mixture of bright plaids and lame-plastered trouser suits.
   There were big-collared coats and shawl-wrapped dresses with
pleated full skirts in lengths short or hovering around the knee.
   Jean-Charles de Castelbajac went to the nursery for inspiration
in sporty clothes. He appliqued naive motifs of houses and trees on
duffel coats, or had hand-painted animal spots on fluffy long
jackets over striped tights.
   Primary colors dominated, but he also used ivory and pastels,
especially in big mohair coats.
   Bernard Perris jazzed up his collection with bright colors in a
group of miniskirts and shorts topped by shawls.
   He also showed slim-lined longer brown dresses with bertha
collars, fur wraps and muffs.
   Paul-Louis Orrier is better-known in America than in France for
his dressy clothes, and his show at the Grand Hotel had plenty of
Americans in the audience.
   His models displayed puffy, draped silks and satins with flowers
cascading out of some of the drapes. The short evening wear came in
amethyst, bright green and iridescent taffeta.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd and three
influential committee chairmen are pushing for an amendment to the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty that would limit future
administration interpretations of the accord.
   The amendment, which the administration says would be
unconstitutional, was sparked by Senate Democrats' wrath over
President Reagan's interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty. They have charged that he interpreted the pact too
broadly so he could justify development of the ``Star Wars''
missile defense system.
   Under their proposed attachment to the INF treaty, future
interpretations would be based not just on the text of the treaty,
but also on the voluminous testimony given during weeks of
ratification hearings since Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev signed the pact in December.
   A congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the decision to tack the amendment on was made at a luncheon Friday
attended by Byrd, Foreign Relations Committee chairman Claiborne
Pell of Rhode Island, Armed Services Committee chairman Sam Nunn of
Georgia and Intelligence Committee co-chairman David Boren of
Oklahoma.
   The original author of the proposal was Sen. Joseph Biden Jr.,
D-Del.
   Their condition will be presented to the foreign relations panel
during consideration of the treaty next week, the source said.
   In a commentary attached to the proposed amendment, the senators
have said their purpose was not to resolve the dispute over the ABM
Treaty.
   ``Rather the provision is intended to reaffirm certain
constitutional principles which have been brought into question
during the `reinterpretation' debate,'' the commentary said.
   Many Democrats have argued that the ABM treaty, as outlined
during the ratification hearings in 1972, prevents certain Star
Wars testing and development. The administration has asserted that
its interpretation _ based on the text and the record of
negotiations with the Soviets _ permits the development.
   The Democratic chairmen already have expressed their support for
the INF treaty provisions, which would eliminate all land-based
missiles with ranges between 300 and 3,125 miles.
   Ratification by the required two-thirds of the Senate is
expected, but the attachments of conditions opposed by the
administration would be a complicating factor that could require
renegotiations with the Soviets.
   In a letter to Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a member of the
foreign relations panel, the White House reiterated its fears about
the amendment and said its views were endorsed by the State,
Defense and Justice departments and the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency.
   The letter, signed by Arthur B. Culvahouse, counsel to the
president and made public Friday, said the resolution is
``seriously flawed.''
   He acknowledged that for domestic purposes a president would
adhere to an interpretation generally agreed to by the Senate, but
he said the proposed amendment would go too far, by binding an
administration to ``all statements made by officials of the
executive branch during ratification proceedings.''
   These would include ``answers to over 1,000 questions submitted
by members of the Senate, no matter how trivial or how unimportant
the issue addressed may be to the Senate's advice and consent
deliberations.''
   ``The result might be two INF treaties, one binding domestically
against the president and a second one binding internationally
between the United States and the Soviet Union,'' Culvahouse said.
   That would favor Moscow ``because the Soviet Union is not and
cannot be bound by our domestic processes.''
   The proposal ``only serves the interests of confusion,
ambiguity, confrontation and uncertainty,'' he said.

   Torn and bloodstained from battle,
regimental flags that led Union soldiers into the breach at
Gettysburg and Antietam face a new fight against the ravages of
time, say museum curators trying to save them.
   Many of the 30 silk banners at the Civil War Museum and Library
here remain rolled around their poles, as they were at the end of
the Civil War in 1865, with little protection against aging.
   Some of the flags were wrapped with paper about 15 years ago to
preserve them, but acids in the paper apparently foiled that
effort. When several were gingerly unfurled last month for the
first time since then, some turned to dust or broke apart.
   ``To me they are sacred. ... They are symbols of the ultimate
sacrifice and love of country,'' said Andy Waskie, a member of the
Grand Army of the Republic, a group of descendants of Union
veterans which operates the museum.
   Some of the 6-by-6{-foot banners have the names of battles
written or sewn on them, and many bear patriotic symbols, such as
an eagle bearing swords in its claws.
   Many of the flags were scarred in war; some bear bullet holes
and others are stained with blood.
   Some had their centers cut out, presumably by color sergeants
who carried the flags in battle and wanted a souvenir, according to
Elmer Atkinson, president of the GAR and great-grandson of three
Union soldiers.
   ``It was a great honor to be the color sergeant. Most of the
time he wouldn't live too long. (The flag) became more or less
personal property to them,'' he said.
   Many flags were hand-painted, a practice that has contributed to
their decay, Atkinson said. Acids in the paint have slowly
dissolved the silk over the years.
   The museum is talking to textile experts on how to prevent
further deterioration, he said. Richard A. Sauers, a restoration
expert involved in a similar effort to preserve 315 Civil War flags
stored under glass in the capitol rotunda in Harrisburg, is also
advising Atkinson.
   Preservation techniques include laying the flags flat in
acid-free paper or plastic, Atkinson said.
   At a minimum, the GAR hopes to stop the decay, which would cost
about $1,000 per banner, he said. Attempts to restore them would
cost much more.
   When the colors are unfurled, it will be in a vacuum with
increased humidity ``to try to bring some life back into the
silk,'' Atkinson said.
   ``There's no way to get them back to hanging off poles again,''
he said.
   The GAR is considering different ways to raise the money, but
won't decide until the total cost of preserving the banners is
known, he said.
   The flags were authorized by the state government at the start
of the Civil War in 1861. The state raised 215 regiments, which
were organized along county lines.
   Many of the flags were returned to the state at a July 4, 1866,
parade in Philadelphia. The state wanted the flags back in case
regiments had to be raised again, Atkinson said.

   An Air Force report Friday on a fatal fire
at an MX missile assembly plant said Morton Thiokol Inc. failed to
provide an adequate remote-control system or fully implement other
safety measures recommended after a ``near miss'' six months
earlier.
   The fire Dec. 29 killed five workmen who were manually removing
the steel core from the first stage of an MX motor into which
propellant had been poured and hardened.
   The Air Force concluded the fire was caused either by friction
or static electricity. In the accident, 100,000 pounds of solid
rocket fuel ignited in a fireball at the company's Wasatch
Operations plant 90 miles northwest of here.
   The plant's remote control system includes a video monitor to
allow workers to perform the procedure from a bunker a quarter-mile
away, but ``design deficiencies'' prevented them from using it as
specified, the Air Force said.
   ``The video system ... did not provide the required visibility.
Thus, remote operation requirements were circumvented,'' according
to the report, which said it was common practice among workers not
to use the camera.
   Morton Thiokol officials have said such deviations were only
occasional and were not known to management.
   Installation of a video camera for remote-control use was among
the Air Force's recommendations after a ``near miss'' on May 20,
1987, consisting of ``a flash, followed by a loud report, smoke and
fumes,'' the Air Force said.
   Later inspection indicated a small piece of the solid propellant
had ignited, possibly from friction caused by grit, said the report
issued by the Air Force Inspection and Safety Center at Norton Air
Force Base in California.
   ``In both cases, the operators were raising the core, and the
probable causes were similar,'' the Air Force said. ``Many of the
recommended changes resulting from (the May incident) had not been
fully implemented at the time of the (December) mishap.''
   Other Air Force recommendations stemming from the ``near miss''
included grounding and other measures to reduce static.
   When the Dec. 29 fire broke out, the recommended grounding was
incomplete, and operators didn't understand the requirements or
follow them properly, the report said.
   The manual used by the workers to remove the core ``was vague,
written at a reading level well above that of the average operator,
confusing, hard to follow (sometimes impossible), contradictory and
incomplete,'' the report said.
   The findings were released a day after Morton Thiokol officials
released the results of their own investigation and vowed to appeal
state citations, alleging willful and serious violations, that
carry $30,000 in penalties.
   Rocky Raab, Morton Thiokol spokesman, denied Air Force
allegations company routinely failed to follow written procedures.
``We would take issue with the word routinely,'' he said. ``We
would say sometimes, or occasionally.''
   The company said Thursday that its procedures were clear and
that it did not know why the five men failed to follow them by
entering the assembly building during an operation that should have
been handled by remote control.
   The rocket motors are filled with fuel in a semi-liquid state.
The core is raised from the rocket motor by a hydraulic lift after
the fuel has hardened.
   The Air Force recommended among other thigns that operating
procedures be rewritten, remote operations be properly designed and
enforced and that the company ensure compliance with procedures.
   Since the accident, Morton Thiokol and the Air Force have been
studying ways to reduce the risks of ignition by friction or static.
   The accident has held up MX missile production until the cause
and corrective measures could be determined. The fire caused $6.2
million damage to the assembly building.
   Ed Garrison, president of the company's aerospace group, said
Morton Thiokol hopes to reach an agreement on corrective measures
with the Air Force within two weeks.

   Opponents of U.S. policy in Central America staged
demonstrations across the nation Friday to protest the sending of
U.S. troops to Honduras, and more than 350 people were arrested for
blocking traffic and other disruptions.
   ``I think it is a serious mistake. It's another example of where
President Reagan is exaggerating the situation for his own
purposes,'' former President Jimmy Carter said of the military
action while addressing the Southern University Conference, a
meeting of university presidents.
   In Minneapolis, several hundred protesters marched on a military
recruitment building Friday evening, and some hurled bowling balls,
eggs and paint, broke four windows and ripped up a uniformed
mannequin. Scuffles broke out between protesters and
counterdemonstrators, but there were no arrests or injuries, police
said.
   More than 250 people were arrested in San Francisco, 60 in
Chicago and one in Boston on the second day of protests, police
said. Twenty-four people were arrested for blocking traffic in
front of the White House, and 25 were arrested in Los Angeles when
they refused to leave a federal office building when it closed for
the day.
   About 50 protesters were arrested Thursday, the day 3,200
soldiers were sent to Honduras in what the White House called a
``measured response'' to Nicaraguan forces reportedly crossing the
border into Honduras.
   Friday's arrests in San Francisco came when a crowd of 500
chanting people blocked traffic and the entrance to the Federal
Building. Helmeted police at one point blocked a street, rerouting
rush-hour traffic.
   At least half a dozen violent confrontations erupted when
demonstrators tried to grab police equipment, including batons.
Some officers lashed back, jamming batons in demonstrators'
stomachs and chests.
   Those arrested were handcuffed with plastic ties, photographed
and booked on the street, then taken to the Hall of Justice. Police
said they would be cited by federal authorities and released.
   Many of those arrested had sat down across the entire width of
the street outside the building and refused to move after police
ordered them to disperse. Among them were several elderly people, a
woman with a sleeping infant on her back and well-dressed business
people.
   About 600 protesters participated in another boisterous march
through San Francisco streets in the evening. The demonstrators,
representing the gay community, said the money spent on sending
troops would be better spent on AIDS research.
   In Minneapolis, Deputy Police Chief David Dubrotka said police
believed that arrests would have just inflamed the situation.
   Col. Curtis Burg, a recruiter at the office that was damaged,
said it would be closed temporarily for repairs. ``I think most of
them (the protesters) are radical, ignorant people who don't know
any better,'' he said.
   On a smaller scale, about 15 people paraded quietly in front of
the federal building in Orlando, Fla. Spokeswoman Beth Rapps said
the U.S. military presence in Honduras was an attempt by the Reagan
administration to persuade Congress to continue financial support
to the Contras fighting Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   ``We should support the people down there by reversing our
policies and provide aid to the poor and the hungry rather than the
Contras,'' she said.
   It was a different story in the Nicaraguan immigrant enclave of
Sweetwater, Fla., where more than 100 people marched with signs
supporting U.S. policy and mutilated an effigy of Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega.
   In Washington, D.C., 150 to 200 people demonstrated outside the
White House, said police Officer Tom Randolph. Twenty-four people
were arrested after the protest spilled into Pennsylvania Avenue.
They were to have been fined $50 for blocking traffic, but that was
cut to $25 for disorderly conduct because they didn't use a
vehicle, Randolph said.
   The Chicago arrests, on misdemeanor disorderly conduct charges,
came after demonstrators pasted 8{-by-11-inch orange stickers on
first-floor windows at the downtown federal building and sat in
intersections, police said. Many of the stickers bore
skull-and-crossbone symbols and the message ``Stop U.S.
intervention in Central America.''
   The 400 protesters also chanted ``Reagan sent the troops today,
get them out is what we say.''
   ``Bring the troops home. No Contra aid, no war,'' the Boston
protesters chanted.
   About 80 people rallied in front of a military recruiting center
in Boston, blocking two lanes of traffic and interrupting the
morning rush hour, and about 10 of them occupied the recruiting
center peacefully while the rest of the demonstration broke up,
police said.
   ``I believe our actions in Central America are wrong,'' said
Lenore Azaroff, 22, of Somerville, Mass. ``I believe sending troops
to Honduras is the first step to another Vietnam.''
   The demonstrators in the recruiting center were dragged outside
at midafternoon without being charged and the doors were closed
behind them, said Robert Dove, a spokesman for the Pledge of
Resistance, which sponsored the rally. ``Everybody's gone home,''
said a man who answered the phone in the Navy section of the
building and wouldn't give his name.
   About 200 people gathered at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine,
and at Augusta, Maine, about 15 people quietly gathered at Memorial
Circle where the city's busiest streets converge, holding up signs
saying ``Stop the Reagan War Machine'' and ``U.S. Troops Out of
Honduras.''
   In Sioux Falls, S.D., about 70 people opposed to the sending of
troops to Honduras demonstrated outside the main post office while
about 15 people supporting the Reagan administration shouted taunts
through bullhorns. Three people were arrested.
   In Seattle, about 40 cars circled the federal building to show
their opposition to the troop movement, jamming streets for about
an hour. The protest also attracted about 100 people on foot. In
Providence, R.I., a protest attracted about 60 demonstrators.

   A 101-year-old Mexican who was smuggled into
the United States in the back seat of his son's car 14 years ago
became the oldest alien to gain legal status under the amnesty
program, officials said Friday.
   ``Gracias, muchas gracias a todos (Thank you very much
everyone),'' Carlos Romero-Gaitan said as he was presented a
temporary residency permit, or green card, by Howard Ezell, western
regional director the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   In recent weeks, Ezell and other INS officials have taken pains
to publicize the impending May 4 deadline to apply for amnesty.
   Romero-Gaitan, who was born in San Pedro, worked on a hacienda
and as a rodeo rider, and operated a Guadalajara tortilla shop
until his retirement at age 82 in 1968.
   When his wife died in 1974, his son Carlos Jr. of Watsonville,
Calif., flew to Guadalajara and took him by plane to Tijuana, where
they got into a waiting car. With the father asleep in the back,
Carlos Jr. drove to the border.
   ``They (the Border Patrol) asked everyone else in the car for
identification, but they didn't want to disturb the man who was
asleep, so he got through clean,'' INS spokesman Joe Flanders said.
   Flanders said Romero-Gaitan has lived ever since in Watsonville,
tending the family's garden, watching cowbody shows and boxing
matches on television and venturing out to an annual rodeo in the
Salinas area.
   Romero-Gaitan said Friday that he decided to apply for amnesty
now ``so I can feel free to go out of my house and not be afraid of
being picked up.''
   Four of his five children are alive and live in the United
States and Mexico. He has 30 grandchildren and 40
great-grandchildren.

   Trumpet player Billy Butterfield,
whose melodic horn was heard in recordings by some of the biggest
names of the swing era, died of throat cancer Friday, his wife
said. He was 71.
   Butterfield played with Benny Goodman, Bob Crosby, Artie Shaw
and Les Brown.
   He joined the Crosby band in 1937, recording their hit
``Moonlight in Vermont.'' Three years later, he went with Shaw,
joining in the recording of ``Stardust.'' With Goodman, Butterfield
soloed on ``La Rosita.''
   Born in Middletown, Ohio, Butterfield started out playing the
violin, bass and trombone before finding his true passion, the
trumpet. He studied medicine in college for two years, giving it up
to play full time.
   Once a member of the CBS and NBC studio bands, Butterfield often
free-lanced with his own group. In 1968, he became a charter member
of the World's Greatest Jazzband, a group of traditional jazzmen
reunited in the 1960s.
   In recent years, Butterfield was often a featured performer at
jazz festivals throughout the United States and Europe.
   In addition to his wife, Dorothy, survivors include two sons;
two daughters, and five grandchildren.
   A memorial service was scheduled for Sunday.

   The United States claimed Nicaragua began
planning a military incursion into Honduras when Congress cut off
Contra aid, and Managua accused Washington of creating an
``artificial crisis'' to justify direct military action against it.
   ``This invasion was no accident,'' U.S. Ambassador Herbert S.
Okun told the Security Council Friday. ``It was not hot pursuit ..
. It was and is a planned offensive conducted ... in clear
violation of international law and conventions.''
   The urgent session was sought by Nicaragua to protest the United
States' sending 3,200 troops to Honduras on exercises Managua
called a threat to its leftist Sandinista government and to
international peace and security.
   The United States claims it sent in soldiers at Honduras'
request after Nicaraguan troops crossed the border in an effort to
wipe out the U.S.-supported Contras.
   Okun said the presence of U.S. forces was a measured response to
the alleged incursion that ``does not constitute either a threat or
the use of force against Nicaragua.''
   Ambassador Jorge Ramon Hernandez of Honduras said Nicaragua is
trying to create confusion and chaos in Central America.
   ``We denounce this invasion as the expansionistic, aggressive
attitude of Nicaragua, not only to my country but to others,'' he
said.
   Okun added: ``The Sandinistas have been preparing for this
operation since the beginning of March, moving equipment, vehicles,
supplies, fuel and troops closer to the border and establishing a
forward staging area within 45 miles of the Honduran border.
   ``They apparently began planning this attack in reaction to a
vote in the U.S. Congress that ended aid to the Nicaraguan
resistance.'' On Feb. 3, President Reagan narrowly lost a House
vote on continuing Contra aid. A Democratic alternative was
defeated, 216 to 208, a month later.
   The Sandinista government has said the offensive began March 8
and had succeeded in driving hundreds of Contra guerrillas back
into Honduras, where they have base camps.
   Nicaraguan envoy Rita Delia Casco denied during Friday's session
that Sandinista troops were in Honduras and said the United States
is to blame for any conflict between the two Central American
neighbors.
   She accused the White House of being out to justify direct
military action against Nicaragua: ``This is a crisis artificially
created by the U.S. administration ... The military actions we have
taken are limited to the defense of our territory and sovereignty.''
   In Managua, a Sandinista military official indicated privately
that Nicaraguan troops had cross the border. And Hernandez said
Sandinista troops were still in Honduras on Friday.
   Ms. Casco claimed the United States was preparing ``to step up
its military presence on Central American soil.''
   She said a U.S. Congressional delegation would be welcome to
visit Nicaragua on a fact-finding mission, including border areas.
   ``If truly the government of the United States wishes to support
the peace process in Central America,'' the Nicaraguan envoy said,
``it is not by sending American young men to risk their lives ...
It should put an end to its policy of state terrorism.''
   Okun said the United States supports the regional peace plan
authored by President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, but claimed
Nicaragua has failed to abide by it by discussing substantive
issues with the opposition.
   He said it does not want negotiations with the Contras _ but
their surrender: ``The events which have unfolded in the past few
days have confirmed our worst fears about Nicaragua's true intent.''
   Ms. Casco said it is the United States that wants to block a
cease-fire and sabotage the peace plan, which calls for an end to
outside aid to insurgents.
   She accused President Reagan of cynically employing a ``pack of
lies'' and generating hysteria to help gain Congressional approval
for further aid to the Contras.
   The 15-member Security Council adjourned without a resolution or
vote.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is considering a
Nicaraguan request to send a joint fact-finding mission with the
Organization of American States to the Nicaraguan-Honduran border.
   The peace plan, signed Aug. 7, calls for cease-fires, democratic
reforms and negotiations to end civil wars in El Salvador,
Guatemala and Nicaragua.

   An ape billed as the world's largest
lowland gorilla in captivity got its first look at the outside
world since it was captured as an infant 20 years ago.
   ``He's never really had the wind in his face, the rain in his
face, the sun on him in 20 years,'' said Pat Quinn, director of The
Zoo.
   Colossus, estimated to weigh at least 550 pounds, moved
cautiously and clutched a security blanket in his powerful hands
Friday as he ventured from his cage into an outdoor enclosure.
   The 6-foot, 2-inch ape never strayed more than a few feet from
the cage door for the first hour, but soon was roaming throughout
the 6,000-square-foot pen.
   The lumbering gorilla pounded his fist against the 1\-inch-thick
glass enclosing the observation area, causing spectators to recoil.
One woman was so stunned she dropped her camera.
   Until he was moved here Sunday, Colossus had spent nearly all
his life in a 240-square-foot indoor cage at Benson's Animal Park
in Hudson, N.H. The Zoo bought him for $37,800 at auction when
Benson's closed last October, but he remained there until the new
facilities could be built.
   Colossus was brought Sunday to The Zoo but kept inside until
Friday so he could become accustomed to his new suite of two
adjoining cages before being reintroduced to the outdoors.
   When the door to his cage was opened, Colossus clutched his
blanket for security and peeked out several times before extending
his right hand through the opening.
   He did this several times, putting one arm out and then both,
before he finally climbed out. Then he withdrew several more times
into the cage.
   ``Come on, son, come see me,'' Quinn shouted.
   At one point, the ape bent over to smell the grass just outside
his door before bounding back inside.
   ``He doesn't know what it is,'' Quinn said. ``He's figuring out
what this new texture is under his feet.''
   In New Hampshire, the gorilla never felt anything underfoot
except concrete and steel, said Quinn.
   The Zoo plans to breed Colossus. But first the giant ape will
have to learn how to behave like a gorilla _ he has not seen
another member of his species since his capture, Quinn said.
   Quinn said he wants to obtain another bachelor male or a
non-productive female as a mentor for Colossus before selecting a
mate.

   More avalanches crashed down on mountain
villages in the northern Kashmir state, killing at least 145 people
and injuring more than 100, United News of India reported today.
   The casualties in Friday's snow slides brought to at least 217
the death toll from avalanches in the mountain state since snow
storms hit March 10.
   UNI said the Friday's avalanches hit three villages in in Kargil
district, about 90 miles northeast of the state's capital of
Srinagar.
   The agency said senior government officials made aerial survey
of the affected areas and relief operations were under way. It said
roads to many of the affected villages were blocked by snow.

   Francis Bacon, whose paintings of hideously
distorted human figures have made him the highest-paid living
British artist, will show his works in the Soviet Union, the
British Council said.
   The council, which promotes Britain abroad, said Friday that 43
Bacon canvases will be displayed in a two-month exhibition opening
in Moscow in September.
   The show, requested by the Union of Soviet Artists, will be the
first in Moscow by a contemporary British artist.
   ``Bacon himself was delighted to hear that Soviet artists admire
him, and he will go to Moscow with his paintings,'' said council
spokesman John Nickson.
   A record $1.7 million for a work of the 78-year-old artist was
offered last May. The offer was for his 1953 picture, ``Study for
Portrait 1-8,'' one of eight paintings of Pope Innocent X.

<HEAD>Democrats Hoping To Gain Ground On One Another In Kansas, Puerto
Rico</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Kansas and Puerto Rico claimed political center stage for the
weekend as Democratic presidential candidates sought to gain ground
on one another and George Bush expected to bolster his already
commanding lead by adding a few offshore delegates.
   On the Democratic side, 39 delegates were at stake in Kansas
caucuses today and another 51 were up for grabs in Sunday's primary
in Puerto Rico.
   Among Republicans, the vice president was expected to dominate
the winner-take-all vote in Puerto Rico and pick up all 14 GOP
delegates. Kansas Republicans already have made their wishes known,
favoring home-state contender Bob Dole.
   Michael Dukakis, Albert Gore Jr. and Jesse Jackson all
campaigned in Kansas during the week, while Richard Gephardt
instead focused his energies on Michigan's March 26 caucuses and
Paul Simon straggled along behind.
   Dukakis, his prospects enhanced by a strong organizing effort,
had a slight edge heading into today's Kansas caucuses.
   ``We've been organized in Kansas for eight months,'' said
Dukakis' state campaign chairman, state Sen. Paul Feleciano. ``...
I think we'll get 20 to 24 of the 39 delegates still to be picked.''
   Gore's state campaign chairman, state Sen. Joe Norvell, was
hoping the Tennessee senator's late forays into Kansas ``could
minimize what I would consider an early lead for Gov. Dukakis.''
   Jackson had out-organized Gore, but supporters conceded that not
enough counties were organized to claim a majority of the delegates.
   Gephardt, struggling to recover from the thrashings he took on
Super Tuesday and again in Illinois, was hoping Michigan would
revive his flagging campaign.
   Eighteen members of Congress flew to Michigan on Friday to
campaign for the Missouri congressman but a poll showed him
trailing well behind Dukakis and Jackson.
   ``We're going to make political history in Michigan, just as we
did in Iowa,'' said Gephardt, who had his best showing to date in
Iowa's leadoff caucus.
   Cash-poor Simon was in Pennsylvania on Friday for a series of
fund-raisers. He continue to predict none of the Democrats would
lock up the nomination before the national convention in July.
   ``If you're talking about buying the nomination, I can't do
that,'' he said. ``If you're talking about winning the nomination,
I can do that.''
   Gore spent Friday vote-hunting in Puerto Rico, where he said
that he would consider allowing the territory to be exempt from the
federal minimum wage and that he favored letting the territory
decide itself whether to become a U.S. state.
   Dukakis released a videotaped address in Spanish in which he
pledged to work to increase payments to Puerto Ricans under the
Medicaid, Aid to Families with Dependent Children and Supplemental
Social Security programs.
   Bush was the only Republican to mount an organizing campaign in
Puerto Rico.
   Dole's weakened campaign, meanwhile, continued to shrink, with
only about 10 to 12 aides left on the payroll, according to
spokeswoman Dale Tate.
   Pat Robertson, campaigning in California, conceded Bush had an
overwhelming delegate lead but pledged to stay in the race because
``there has to be a rallying point for conservatives.''
   Other political activity on tap today: Gephardt hoped to turn
his victory in last month's South Dakota primary into delegates at
today's state convention, and Dukakis and Jackson, the
front-runners in the Texas primary on March 8, were expected to
divvy up most of the 64 delegates at that state's caucuses.

<HEAD>U.S. Lawmakers To Monitor Salvadoran Elections, Rebels Warn Of
Disruption</HEAD>

   A congressional delegation was bound for El
Salvador today to monitor legislative and municipal elections that
leftist forces have threatened to disrupt.
   President Reagan selected the group of Republicans and mostly
conservative Democrats to watch Sunday's election and report back
to him, officials said Friday.
   ``Our presence there is mainly one to deter any fraud (by the
participating political parties) and to objectively and fairly
report what we see happening,'' said Rep. John G. Rowland, R-Conn.,
a delegation member.
   Andy Fisher, an aide to Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., said the
lawmakers will visit polling places in San Salvador and the
countryside despite the pinpointing of the polls as military
targets by the leftist forces.
   But Rowland said the threats may keep the delegation away from
the polls. The delegation's presence at the polls would ``show the
voters we're not afraid,'' he said, but added ``I'm not sure if
we're doing that.''
   ``We cannot stop violence,'' Rowland said.
   The delegation, headed by Lugar and Rep. John P. Murtha, D-Pa.,
was scheduled to leave Andrews Air Force Base today and return late
Sunday night or early Monday morning.
   The U.S.-backed Salvadoran government headed by President Jose
Napoleon Duarte is holding elections Sunday for mayors and councils
in the country's 262 municipalities and for all 60 seats in the
Legislative Assembly.
   Leftist groups have vowed to ban road transportation during the
elections to disrupt voting, and said polling places will be
``military objectives.'' The rebels maintain that peace must be
achieved before any election is held.
   The main electoral opposition to the ruling Christian Democratic
Party is Arena, a rightist group.
   ``This particular election is a test for democracy, not only
because of the hazards proposed by the rebels, but perhaps because
many citizens of El Salvador, after five elections, have lost some
of their enthusiasm for democracy,'' Lugar said in a statement.
   Rowland said the election, which has not gained widespread
attention because it does not include a presidential race, is
important because Duarte's party could lose its slim majority in
the assembly.
   ``There could be a definite change in the makeup of the
Assembly,'' the congressman said in a telephone interview from
Connecticut.
   The congressional group will be briefed by State Department
officials in San Salvador before monitoring the elections.
   The House members include Reps. Rowland; Murtha; Beverly B.
Byron, D-Md.; John R. Kasich, R-Ohio; Mickey Edwards, R-Okla.; and
Alan B. Mollohan, D-W.Va., according to Rowland aide Harry Phillips.
   Senators include Lugar, Frank H. Murkowski, R-Ala.; Christopher
S. Bond, R-Mo.; said Fisher.
   The Salvadoran Defense Ministry said about 53,000 troops will be
deployed to provide election security.

   A New Jersey developer and a Wild West show
owner are among the Western history buffs who bought up the largest
collection of ``Buffalo Bill'' Cody memorabilia ever auctioned _
with some pieces fetching more than twice their appraised value.
   ``Who better symbolizes the American West than Buffalo Bill?''
said buyer R.L. Wilson, a historical consultant to the Colt
Firearms Co. of Hartford, Conn., who bid Friday on one of eight
guns in the collection.
   The prices paid ranged from $175 for a telegram sent by the
legendary roughrider and showman to $22,500 for a silver-handled
Plains rifle.
   In all, more than $500,000 was spent on the collection of over
300 items, which were perserved by Cody's sister, Julia Cody
Goodman, auction officials said.
   The collection was sold by San Francisco gun collector Greg
Martin, who bought the artifacts for $300,000 last year, removing
them from storage in Billings, Mont., for the first time in 20
years.
   The collection was unique for its large number of personal
items, including Cody's buffalo-hide coat that sold for $18,000 and
a letter that sold for $3,575 in which Cody discusses the death of
his son. The prices included a 10 percent fee for the auction
house, Butterfield & Butterfield.
   Also up for auction were other letters to Cody's sister
discussing his marriage and other intimate events.
   ``We are interested in the correspondence because it is so
revealing and personal,'' Paul Fees, curator of the Buffalo Bill
Museum in Cody, Wyo., said before the bidding began. ``We have a
strong biographical interest.''
   Other bidders for the letters included Thomas B. Morrison, of
the Buffalo Bill Ranch Historic Park in North Platte, Neb. Cody
descendant Walter Goodman of Dallas, Julia Cody's grandson, was
expected to bid for the letters by phone, Fees said. The names of
the successful bidders were not known.
   A pair of chaps worn by Cody sold for $1,400 and a rope lariat
went for $500. Other items included Cody's silver-handled
toothbrush, a family Bible and dozens of photographs, show bills
and theater tickets chronicling William F. Cody's life as the
Indian fighter, buffalo hunter and scout who, along with shooting
champion W. ``Doc'' Carver, founded the first Wild West Show. Cody
died in 1917.

   Ned Gillette's first thought after being knocked
into the treacherous waters off Cape Horn was not about his fate,
but whether the ``Sea Tomato'' would survive the wintry gale in its
quest to sail to Antarctica.
   Moments later, Gillette was pulled back aboard the high-tech
rowboat _ never fully tested in open ocean _ to join three other
adventurers who hoped it was possible to row 600 miles across the
treacherous Drake Passage from South America.
   On March 7, after suffering three knockdowns in heavy seas and
skirting icebergs, the four waddled about Nelson Island off
Antarctica like the penguins that greeted them at the end of the
voyage.
   ``You should see what it's like to try to walk on land after
being thrown around at sea for 12 days,'' said Gillette, whose
arrival in Antarctica ended a 4{-year quest that included an
unsuccessful expedition last year.
   ``Until we made it, we weren't really sure it could be done,''
Gillette, 42, a native of Stowe, Vt., said Friday.
   While the crew bailed out flooded cabins and rowed their 28-foot
boat through 100-foot swells, a Massachusetts weather station each
day fed them with sophisticated forecasts and the boat's location
was tracked by satellite.
   The ``Sea Tomato,'' so-called because of its red color, was
built for $17,000 and equipped with state-of-the-art navigational
and survival equipment. After waiting for nearly a month for proper
weather conditions, the expedition almost ended in disaster Feb. 22
off the Chilean coast. Twelve hours after leaving under sail, a
heavy squall erupted and tipped the craft, sending Gillette
overboard. Gillette, an experienced moutaineer, was saved by a line
fastened to the boat.
   In the next several days, the boat took two more spills, casting
crew members Jay Morrison, 34, and Fred Trombly, 32, into the sea.
   Three days out, the crew took down the sails and began to row in
shifts, sometimes all night. They creeped southward at an average
rate of 2.3 knots, about walking speed.
   Crew member Mark Eichenberger, 35, said the raging Drake Passage
seas and variable weather made the expedition more challenging than
other rowing voyages across the Atlantic and Pacific.
   ``Why did we do it?'' said Morrison. ``Because nobody had ever
done it before. That's a pretty good reason.''

<HEAD>Study: Middle And Low Level Managers Have Increased Heart Attack
Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grocery store managers, construction
foremen, mine inspectors and other low-level and middle managers
have a greater risk of heart attack than blue-collar workers or
other white-collar workers, a study shows.
   Previous studies have found that blue-collar workers are more
likely to die of heart attacks than white-collar workers. But
Robert Brackbill, the author of the new study, said Friday that the
managers with increased risk of disability from a heart attack are
in some respects more like blue-collar workers than white-collar
workers.
   ``They had the lowest mean level of education compared to other
professional groups,'' said Brackbill, of the National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health in Cincinnati.
   Brackbill said the group's socio-economic status and wages were
also closer to those of blue-collar workers and, like them, the
middle and low-level managers might not have good access to medical
care.
   Brackbill, who presented his findings at a meeting of the
American Heart Association, studied samples from 446,000 social
security disability records covering the periods 1969-1973 and
1975-1976.
   During the first period, low-level and middle managers had 43
percent more chance of having a heart attack than other
white-collar workers and blue-collar workers. The risk was 63
percent higher for them in the second period.
   The study also found that educators, lawyers and entertainers
had among the lowest risks of professionals while medical
professionals _ doctors, nurses and technicians _ had a slightly
higher risk than blue-collar workers.
   Brackbill had no information on the smoking and eating habits
and alcohol consumption of the workers he studied, so it's possible
that the increased risks he identified were due to those factors
rather than jobs.
   Had that been the case, however, he said it would have been
unlikely for a single occupational group to have increased risk.
The risk would more likely have been spread among all professionals
or all blue-collar workers, rather than be specific to certain
subgroups, he said.
   The study suggests that occupation is associated with
disability, but does not prove it, he said.
   The American Heart Association includes stress as one of the
risk factors for heart disease, and notes that stress may increase
the likelihood of getting heart disease when combined with other
risk factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure and elevated
levels of cholesterol in the blood.
   Dr. Peter Schnall of Cornell University Medical College in New
York City reported in a separate study that high blood pressure was
associated with ``job strain'' _ a combination of high
psychological demands on the job and little latitude in making
decisions.
   In another study, Suzanne Haynes of the National Institutes of
Health in Bethesda, Md., said that women in high-demand,
low-control jobs operating computer terminals all day reported a
higher occurrence of angina, a chest pain associated with heart
disease.

   President Jose Azcona Hoyo said he
was sending troops to rugged mountains near the Nicaraguan border
to oust Sandinista forces, and a White House source said U.S.
helicopter assistance was requested.
   Azcona said Friday that 2,000 troops had begun moving into the
Bocay jungle region on orders to drive out the Sandinistas, adding
that his government was preparing ``an operation to bomb inside
Honduran territory.''
   He told a news conference he was `counting on the support of the
United States'' to deter Sandinista aggression. He called the
arrival in Honduras Thursday and Friday of more than 3,000 U.S.
troops a ``warning'' to Nicaragua.
   At the United Nations on Friday, Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government denied U.S. and Honduran claims that its troops invaded
Honduras, where the rebels maintain base camps.
   Managua's U.N. envoy accused the Reagan adminstration of
creating ``an artificial crisis'' in a bid to get Congress to
restore military aid to the Contras.
   On Thursday, Honduras mounted air raids in the border area where
Sandinista troops allegedly penetrated Honduran territory in
pursuit of Contra rebels. Azcona said his forces would bomb
Sandinista positions until an estimated 1,000 remaining Nicaraguan
troops withdraw.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Michael O'Brien said Friday evening that
the United States was considering airlifting Honduran troops to
non-combat areas. In Washington, administration sources said the
Honduran request would likely be approved. The sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The United States helped Honduras move troops to the border in
December 1986, after Nicaraguan forces attacked Contra camps in
Honduras. No Americans were involved in combat.
   The U.S. Embassy said about 800 American paratroopers _ the last
group of the 3,200 troops sent to Honduras _ were dropped onto
Palmerola air base Friday morning. The Defense Department said the
U.S. troops would be in Central America for about 10 days.
   Azcona said he expected the ``simple presence and immediate
response'' of U.S. troops would scare the Sandinistas into
withdrawing. He repeated what U.S. officials have been saying, that
U.S. troops would not be involved in any fighting.
   On Thursday, Honduran warplanes struck at Nicaraguan positions
Tegucigalpa says were inside its borders. But Managua says rockets
hit inside Nicaragua, near the Sandinista's border military
encampment at San Andres de Bocay.
   Sandinista troops retook San Andres de Bocay from the Contras in
an offensive Managua says began March 8 and drove hundreds of
guerrillas into Honduras. Privately, a Sandinista military official
indicated Nicarguan troops had entered Honduras.
   A high-ranking Honduran officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said about 2,000 soldiers were moving Friday into the
area of hostilities from a base at Juticalpa, about 90 miles west
of San Andres de Bocay, and warplanes were on call.
   The officer said about half of the original force of 2,000
Sandinistas who crossed the border had returned to Nicaragua, while
the rest penetrated deeper into Honduran territory and were spread
over an area of about 40 square miles.
   Another source in Tegucigalpa, who asked not to be identified,
said the Sandinistas stopped penetrated deeper into Honduras when
the United States publicized the incursion earlier this week.
   The source said the only activity reported in the region Friday
involved Sandinistas he said fired highly flammable white
phosphorus at Contras inside Honduras, estimated at 600 fighters.
   The main objective of the Sandinista offensive was to destroy a
Contra headquarters and a large rebel supply depot in the jungle
north of San Andres de Bocay, the source said, declining to name
the site.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua said Thursday that his
soldiers were ready to ``combat and liquidate'' the 82nd Airborne
and would continue the anti-Contra offensive in an area from
central Nicaragua to the border.
   In their 6-year-old insurgency, the Contras have had secret
bases in Honduras from which they have attacked Nicaragua.
   At the U.N. Security Council meeting Friday, Nicaraguan envoy
Rita Delia Casco said the United States would be to blame if war
broke out, saying the crisis was ``artificially created by the U.S.
adminstration.''
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun said Managua had planned the
anti-Contra offensive after Congress denied further aid last month.
He denied U.S. forces sent to Honduras constitute a threat or use
of force against Nicaragua.
   Ambassador Jorge Ramon Hernandez of Honduras said Nicaragua was
trying to derail peace efforts in Central America.
   Sandinista-Contra talks set for Monday are now doubtful.

   Foreign observers of
Czechoslovak-Soviet military exercises will be allowed for the

   He said 22 countries have applied to send a total of 43
observers to the maneuvers to be held by 17,400 Soviet and
Czechoslovak military personnel in western Czechoslovakia March
22-28.
   Brychta, first deputy chief of the general staff, said Friday
that the use of cameras and recorders by the observers ``should
make their work easier and goes beyond the framework of conditions
provided for by the Stockholm document.''
   Under the Stockholm agreement on security and cooperation in
Europe, the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact and North Atlantic Treaty
Organization are to allow foreign observers to view large military
maneuvers.

<HEAD>Witness: Meese Interceded With Pentagon For Wedtech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Wedtech Corp. executive says a friend
of Attorney General Edwin Meese III told him that Meese intervened
with the Pentagon to help get a $24 million Navy contract awarded
to the Bronx contractor.
   Mario Moreno made the revelation Friday in his fourth day of
testimony in the racketeering trial of Rep. Mario Biaggi and six
others accused of bribery and influence peddling involving Wedtech.
   Moreno said he met Meese's friend, San Francisco lawyer E.
Robert Wallach, in December 1983. He said he asked Wallach to get
Meese ``to change the Navy's mind'' about awarding Wedtech only the
less lucrative part of a contract to build bridge pontoons. Meese
was presidential counselor at the time.
   Meese said he would ask then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
to call then-Navy Secretary John Lehman, Wallach told Moreno.
   In January 1984, a month after Wallach told Moreno of Meese's
alleged intercession, Wedtech received the approval making it
eligible for the entire pontoon contract, which it signed in April
1984.
   Moreno testified previously that Wallach told him Meese also had
interceded on Wedtech's behalf with the Commerce Department over
another defense contract.
   Moreno had described Meese's alleged intervention for the
pontoon contract in an affidavit disclosed last October at a Senate
hearing in Washington. At that time, both Meese and Weinberger said
they did not remember the incident.
   The contract was to build floating bridge units to link supply
ships with U.S. rapid deployment forces.
   Wedtech, a $100 million-a-year defense contractor before it
filed for bankruptcy in 1986, grew from a small Bronx machine shop
through a series of no-bid defense contracts.
   The company was able to obtain those contracts through a Small
Business Administration program for minority-controlled businesses,
but federal prosecutors claim that Wedtech falsely portrayed itself
as being eligible.
   Wallach, Meese's former personal lawyer, is under indictment for
allegedly taking bribes from Wedtech officials in exchange for
trying to influence Meese and others.
   Last December, a special prosecutor in Washington said there was
insufficient evidence to charge Meese with wrongdoing in the
Wedtech case.
   Moreno, one of four ex-Wedtech officials who have pleaded guilty
to bribing public officials and other crimes, also testified that
the company paid former Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon and
Biaggi's law firm $50,000 each for their help in a real estate deal
with the city.
   Moreno said Wedtech did not have the proper facilities to
assemble and test the pontoons and wanted to lease city-owned land
in the Bronx.

<HEAD>Envoy Goes to Mideast To Discuss U.S. Peace Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration, looking for an
``early response'' to its Mideast peace plan, is sending special
envoy Philip Habib to Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Morocco to
discuss the proposal.
   The State Department said Habib will consult next week with
officials in the Arab countries and brief them on the discussions
held this week in Washington with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir.
   He also is expected to ask Jordan for its response to the
proposal formulated by Secretary of State George P. Shultz for
Israeli-Arab talks about Palestinian self-rule in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``We're looking for an early response to our proposals from the
parties in the region,'' department spokesman Charles Redman said
Friday.
   Shultz's plan envisions that talks on self-rule would begin May
1 between Jordan, Israel, Palestinians and any other Arabs wishing
to take part, under the auspices of the United States, the Soviet
Union, China, England and France. The plan also calls for talks to
start Dec. 1 about the future of the West Bank and Gaza Strip that
Israel captured from the Arabs in the 1967 Mideast war.
   ``We have an ambitious timetable,'' Redman said. ``This is an
active process. ... We're intensively engaged in it.''
   Shamir already has rejected the idea of an international peace
conference, fearing it would bring pressure on Israel to cede
occupied lands, but he promised to bring up the plan next week for
a vote by his divided cabinet.
   ``We continue to be encouraged by the active and serious
consideration being given to this proposal by all the parties
concerned,'' Redman said.
   Habib, a retired ambassador who negotiated between Israel and
the Arabs in the early 1980s, undertook a one-day trip to Jordan at
the end of January to sound out King Hussein about the Shultz plan.
This time he will spend less than a week on his mission, Redman
said.
   The United States also is consulting with Syria on the Shultz
plan, but this is being done through the embassies in Washington
and Damascus, according to a State Department official who spoke
only on condition of anonymity.
   Habib's stop in Morocco is designed to bring that country into
the process as a moderating influence. Morocco, a former French
colony, enjoys good standing with both the Arabs and Israel.

   Five former passenger service agents for
airlines have been convicted of participating in an eight-year
conspiracy to smuggle $1.5 billion worth of cocaine through Kennedy
International Airport.
   After five days of deliberations, a jury in U.S. District Court
in Brooklyn returned guilty verdicts Friday against the five men
and another defendant on all counts of the nine-count indictment.
   The defendants were among 56 people arrested last year in
connection with the drug smuggling operation. Of those arrested,
most have either pleaded guilty or been convicted in state and
federal courts. Six others remain fugitives.
   All six defendants were convicted of the most serious charge of
conspiracy, which carries a possible life sentence. Sentencing is
expected to take place within six weeks.
   Federal prosecutors charged during the six-week trial that four
of the airline employees used their positions to circumvent customs
in the United States and Brazil to bring several tons of cocaine
into the country between 1979 and 1987.
   The two lead defendants _ Jean Marie Chapoteau, 50, of Queens, a
former passenger service agent for Pan American World Airways, and
Pedro DaSilva, 49, of Miami, who held a similar position at Varig
Airlines _ were charged with running separate smuggling operations
at their respective airlines.
   Two other Pan Am service agents _ Vincent Cicali, 29, of Queens,
and Bruce Duignan, 31, of Massapequa _ were accused of working for
a third smuggling operation at Kennedy run by another former Pan Am
employee, Aart Vanwort.
   Vanwort pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge earlier this year
and was one of the prosecution's key witnesses during the trial. He
is awaiting sentencing.
   The other defendants were also convicted of purchasing portions
of the cocaine smuggled into the country. They are Michael Crown,
34, of Queens, a former passenger service agent for Pan Am, and
Steven Finn, 33, an auctioneer from Boston.
   The case stemmed from an investigation by the federal Drug
Enforcement Agency, the U.S. Customs Service, the Internal Revenue
Service and the Port Authority police.

   Two decades ago the Kerner Commission said news
organizations were ``shockingly backward in seeking out, hiring,
training and promoting'' blacks. They still are, according to a
group of black journalists.
   Despite some industry attempts to improve black employment
prospects, ``what has resulted in far too many instances can simply
be characterized as a lot of motion and little movement,'' the
group said in a report released Friday.
   The National Association of Black Journalists formed a panel to
compare the status of blacks in journalism today with the late
1960s, when race riots prompted President Lyndon Johnson to appoint
Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner as head of the National Advisory
Commission on Civil Disorders.
   The Kerner Commission's conclusion ``still rings true,'' said
DeWayne Wickham of the Gannett News Service, president of the NABJ.
   The panel, which Wickham said carried out its study over a
period of several months, acknowledged ``substantial good will''
among news media executives. ``We also found there had not been a
lot of progress.''
   Among the panel's recommendations:
   _ Newspaper publishers should promise to double the number of
black journalists over the next three years, from 3.5 percent of
newsroom employees to 7 percent by 1991.
   _ The National Association of Broadcasters and the
Radio-Television News Directors Association should join the NABJ to
form a task force to halt the decline in blacks working in
television news. A declining number of black men employed in
broadcast news caused the number of minority group members to drop
from 15 percent in 1979 to 13 percent in 1986, the panel said.
   Dwight Ellis, NAB vice president for minority services, said the
reason for the decline was unclear. He said the NAB and news
editors were considering two remedies: an advertising campaign to
tell minority group members about some of the less obvious jobs
available in broadcasting, and an institute to train them for
management.
   Lee Stinnett, executive director of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors, said its surveys show that the number of
minority group members employed in newspaper newsrooms has more
than doubled since 1978, rising from 1,700 to 3,600.
   The percentage of these minority employees, 55 percent of whom
are black, has increased from 4 percent to 6.5 percent, he said.
   Jerry W. Friedheim, president of the American Newspaper
Publishers Association, said the organization was ``working to
increase the number of minority journalists.''
   He said ANPA was readying the first industry-wide survey of
minority employment, and has programs to encourage the hiring and
promotion of blacks, including 12 minority job fairs in the past
year.

<HEAD>Bill Would Boost Nuclear Accident Insurance Pool</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nationwide pool of insurance funds to be
tapped in the event of an accident at a nuclear reactor or related
facility would grow from $700 million to more than $7 billion under
legislation approved by the Senate.
   The proposal, approved by Senate voice vote Friday, is part of
legislation providing a 20-year extension of the Price-Anderson
Act. The bill now goes back to the House, which approved a slightly
different version last July.
   Under current provisions of the Price-Anderson Act, the pool
could pay up to $700 million to compensate victims if the accident
involved a commercial nuclear power plant, and up to $500 million
if it involved a government-owned facility. Both the House and
Senate versions of the renewal legislation would boost the amount
in both cases to more than $7 billion.

   The government is giving illegal aliens who
want to file for amnesty an extra 60 days to come up with the
documents to support their applications for legalization.
   Under the change announced Friday, the application deadline of
May 4 still will stand, but amnesty seekers who file in the final
month before then will have until July 5 to produce back-up
documentation and medical data.
   ``If any of you have ever filed your income tax on the night of
the 14th of April, there's usually one document or one fact you
don't get,'' Attorney General Edwin Meese III told reporters at an
immigration office in Arlington, Va. ``We want to be sure that
doesn't stop anybody from this program.''
   Just over 1 million amnesty applications have been filed, and
although a last-minute surge is anticipated, the volume of requests
is likely to fall far below the 2 million estimated as recently as
January by Alan Nelson, commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service.

<HEAD>Warning to Congress from Palau Lawmakers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of senators from the Pacific Island
chain of Palau says problems with drugs there have been ``permitted
to develop unchecked'' during 40 years of U.S. rule and could best
be solved by a new sovereign government.
   The seven Palau lawmakers on Friday accused a House subcommittee
of unreasonably delaying their country's independence with
unfounded charges of corruption and narcotics trafficking.
   The Palau senators raised the issues in a letter to Ron de Lugo,
the Virgin Islands delegate, who is chairman of a House
subcommittee on insular and international affairs.
   The senators admitted the islands had drug and other problems
but said they had been ``permitted to develop unchecked'' during 40
years of U.S. rule, and could be attacked more effectively now by
the new government with financing promised under the
recently-approved compact of free association with the United
States.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Try to Enforce Traffic Ban on Eve of Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taxi driver Alfonso Valdez
stopped at a red light, and four young men jumped in the car. The
one in the front seat and the one directly behind him pulled
pistols.
   ```We're a guerrilla urban commando cell, and you should know
better than to take your cab out when we've called a transport
ban,''' Valdez quoted one of the men as telling him. They ordered
him out of the cab, set it afire and fled.
   The cab was one of several vehicles burned Friday by guerrillas
trying to enforce the indefinite traffic ban they called to
dissuade voters from participating in Sunday's elections.
   Even so, the government and small-time entrepreneurs with pickup
trucks kept a lot of urban traffic moving.
   Salvadorans cast ballots Sunday to elect all the members of the
60-seat National Assembly and municipal officials nationwide.
Leftist guerrillas fighting the U.S.-backed government since 1979
say the people's will cannot be expressed by voting in wartime.
   Intercity bus transport was reduced by about 80 percent
nationwide, according to dispatchers quoted in telephone and radio
reports.
   The privately owned radio station YSU, with correspondents in
almost all of El Salvador's 14 provinces, said guerrillas burned
eight vehicles in the eastern province of Usulutan.
   The station said two buses, two tractor-trailers, two pickups,
one jeep and one taxi were burned there. No injuries were reported.
   One person died in the capital when an extremely overcrowded
pickup truck overturned. Eighteen people were reported injured in
the accident.
   Scores of pickups with up to 40 people packed in truckbeds and
standing on bumpers circulated in the capital, partially taking the
place of privately owned buses, few of which were seen on the road.
   Rides in the trucks cost up to 60 cents, or five times the
normal bus fare.
   The government put several dozen blue and white state-owned
buses on the streets, and they too were overcrowded, with people
riding on roof luggage racks, hanging from the doors and standing
on the bumpers. Army trucks also were used for passenger transport.
   But many _ probably most _ people simply walked to work.
   Ten yards from where Valdez recounted the Friday evening
hijacking, in a middle class neighborhood of this capital, what was
left of the yellow Toyota smoldered. The guerrillas had run down
the road about a half hour before, and firemen had just
extinguished the blaze.
   ``What could I do?'' said Valdez, 49. ``They were armed.''
   He said his only remaining fear was informing the woman who
owned the taxi that it was now a black hulk.
   Dozens of children stood around, enthralled by the spectacle.
Their parents, who also had gathered to watch the flames consume
the car, criticized the guerrillas.

   The Sandinista government warned its
citizens to brace for a possible invasion by U.S. troops newly
arrived in Honduras and encouraged its soldiers to keep Contra
rebels on the run.
   As Nicaraguan troops on Friday battled the U.S.-supplied
guerrillas in a region bordering Honduras, the leftist government
said it still desires to hold peace talks with the U.S.-backed
rebels next week.
   Government radio warned listeners of ``American imperialism and
the threat of military intervention.'' And a headline in Barricada,
the Sandinista newspaper, said: ``The Order Of The Day: Intensify
Combat.''
   The radio also condemned border air raids by Honduras, which it
said struck inside Nicaragua. Honduras said the raids Thursday were
confined to Sandinista forces that had crossed into Honduran
territory.
   Honduras and the United States contend Sandinista troops entered
Honduras in the rugged jungle region in pursuit of Contras.
Officially, the Sandinistas deny this. But privately, a Nicaraguan
military official indicated Friday that an incursion had occurred.
   Honduran military officials said 1,000 Sandinista soldiers
remained in their territory on Friday.
   In Managua, the Defense Ministry said 17 soldiers and 15 rebels
were killed between Tuesday and Friday in fighting in the central
province of Matagalpa, in Zelaya on the Caribbean coast and
Jinotega, along the Honduran border.
   Civilian sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity for
security reasons, said 17 soldiers were killed and eight wounded in
two clashes Friday in the central province of Chontales. Six rebels
were killed, they said.
   Lt. Col. Javier Carrion, who led the Sandinista offensive, told
reporters Thursday at the border outpost of San Andres de Bocay
that 4,500 Sandinista soldiers backed by bombers and helicopter
gunships were involved in the campaign that began March 8 and drove
hundreds of Contras back into Honduras, where they have base camps.
   Carrion said Sandinista troops killed 92 Contras and wounded
300, at the cost of 34 soldiers dead and 68 wounded.
   He said the purpose was to destroy Contra bases in the border
area, about 40 miles from an important mining region the rebels
attacked in December.
   On Thursday and Friday, the United States flew in 3,200 soldiers
of the 82nd Airborne Division and 7th Light Infantry to Honduras in
what the white house called a ``measured response'' to the alleged
Nicaraguan incursion.
   President Daniel Ortega said Nicaraguan troops would take on the
Americans if necessary.
   His government, meanwhile, insisted it was going ahead with
plans for cease-fire talks with the Contras in Nicaraguan territory
on the Costa Rican border Monday. The rebels said they would
boycott the talks unless the Sandinistas pull out of Honduras.
   Cease-fires in the region's civil wars, and a ban on the use of
one country's territory for attacks on another, are provisions of
the regional peace plan signed Aug. 7 by the five Central American
presidents.
   The plan also calls for an end to outside aid to insurgents.
   In Washington, a bi-partisan group of senators proposed a $48
million package of new aid to the Contras, including renewed
authority for the CIA to deliver previously stockpiled weapons.
   On Feb. 3, President Reagan narrowly lost a House vote on
continuing Contra aid. A Democratic alternative was defeated, 216
to 208, a month later.

<HEAD>Poll Finds California Delegates Like Dukakis, Cuomo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Potential delegates to California's
state Democratic convention favor Michael Dukakis over his
presidential rivals, but they still prefer non-candidate Mario
Cuomo, according to poll results published today.
   The poll of 217 of 1,200 potential delegates to the convention
this weekend in Palm Springs was conducted by the Riverside
Press-Enterprise.
   Asked to rank their favorites among the declared candidates, the
party regulars lined up 38 percent for Dukakis, 22 percent for
Jesse Jackson, 10 percent for Paul Simon, 8 percent for Albert Gore
Jr. and 3 percent for Richard Gephardt. Eighteen percent were
undecided.
   That changed dramatically when the list was expanded to include
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. Cuomo was the favorite of 34 percent,
Dukakis 20 percent, Jackson 16 percent, Simon 7 percent, Gore 6
percent and Gephardt 3 percent, with 15 percent undecided.
   On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, the paper interviewed potential
delegates picked at random from a list provided by the party. Max
Neiman, a University of California, Riverside, political science
professor with polling experience, reviewed the methods and
calculated the sample had a 5.5 percentage point margin of error.

   While the number of New York Democrats who
think Gov. Mario Cuomo should run for president keeps edging up,
the number who think he will run is declining, a poll indicates.
   Results of a poll released Friday by the Marist College
Institute for Public Opinion found that while 59 percent of the
Democrats surveyed said Cuomo should run, only 24 percent said they
thought he would. In a January poll by Marist, 58 percent of the
Democrats said Cuomo should run and 36 percent said they thought
Cuomo would run.
   ``He's pleased that the people are taking him at his word,''
Cuomo spokeswoman Anne Crowley said of the governor's reaction to
the poll results.
   The poll also indicated that Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson
appear to be in a two-man race among likely New York Democratic
primary voters with the crucial April 19 presidential primary just
a month away.
   The poll found that 37 percent of the 459 likely Democratic
voters surveyed said they would vote for Dukakis while 28 percent
said they would back Jackson. The other Democratic candidates
trailed far behind.
   The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage
points.

   A 75-year-old retired police chief
appeared in court for allegedly selling heroin because he says his
allergy-suffering wife wanted to buy a $9,600 carpet, a newspaper
reported.
   Vincenzo Alessi and his wife Fulvia Borello, 61, of this seaside
town in the northern region of Liguria, appeared at a pre-trial
hearing Thursday to answer to charges of drug dealing, Milan's
daily Corriere della Sera reported Friday.
   The Alessis were arrested in May on charges of selling 5 grams
of heroin to a woman in the area. Police said they also found more
than 30 grams of pure heroin inside their Imperia home.
   Alessi said in court that he had become involved in selling
drugs because ``my wife wanted to change the carpeting.'' He said
she insisted on the change because she suffers from allergies.

   A co-founder of the notorious Red Army Faction
leftist gang, having renounced terrorism, can now practice law
again in West Berlin.
   Horst Mahler, 52, who spent six years in prison on a terrorism
conviction, regained his license Friday after a November ruling by
the West German Supreme Court, said West Berlin Justice Department
spokesman Cornel Christoffel.
   The court endorsed an appeal by Mahler against an earlier
refusal by West Berlin's judicial authorities to allow him to work
again as a lawyer.
   The high court pointed out that Mahler distanced himself from
his earlier actions and denounced terrorism.
   Mahler was arrested in West Berlin in 1970 and was convicted
four years later on bank robbery charges and for helping notorious
terrorist Andreas Baader escape from jail.
   He was sentenced to 14 years in prison but was released in 1980
after several public statements condemning terrorism and Red Army
Faction methods.

   Suspected Sikh extremists today shot to
death five members of a Sikh family, including a two-year old girl,
in a raid on the family's farmhouse in Punjab state, police said.
   Police also recovered the bodies of five other people killed
Friday in attacks blamed on Sikh radicals, including three Sikhs
shot to death in the village of Manda in Amritsar District and an
unidentified man killed in nearby Janti village.
   A Sikh farmer, identified as Amrik Singh, was shot to death
Friday night in Jalandhar District, police said.
   The killings raised to at least 480 the number of people who
have died in attacks blamed on the militants since Jan. 1. Last
year, more than 1,000 people were killed in Punjab by the
extremists, who have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for an
independent Sikh homeland in Punjab.
   The latest attack came at 12:30 a.m. in the village of Butt,
about 17 miles north of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar, police said.
   They said four gunmen shot farmer Balbir Singh and his family as
they slept. The other victims were his wife, a son, a
daughter-in-law and his granddaughter, Amandeep, who was 2.
   After the shootings, the extremists set fire to the farmhouse
and fled, police said.
   The motive for the attack was not known, but the militants have
killed a number of moderate Sikhs who disagree with their
separatist goals. The extremists also have accused some Sikhs of
being ``police informers'' and have killed others who refused to
pay extortion money.
   Sikhs, whose sect was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus. Although a minority of about 2
percent in India, Sikhs are a majority in Punjab.

   A World Health Organization panel has concluded
that people infected with the AIDS virus but not the disease itself
do not run a higher-than-normal risk of brain and nervous system
disorders.
   The 48-member panel also said in a statement Friday that ``there
is no evidence'' that screening healthy people for the HIV virus,
which causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, would help
predict ``the onset of functional impairment.''
   The statement noted some people with the disease AIDS or with
AIDS-related-complex have suffered damage to the brain and nervous
systems believed caused by the HIV virus.
   But it said that ``governments, employers and the public can be
assured that based on the weight of available scientific evidence,
otherwise healthy HIV-infected individuals are no more likely to be
functionally impaired than uninfected persons.'' It said these
recommendations would be kept under continual review as additional
scientific material is gathered.
   AIDS is a virus that attacks the body's immune system, leaving
victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers.
   It is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other means
of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or blood
products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or
syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to
child at or before birth.

<TEXT>
   When dusk settles in this
seemingly tranquil eastern Sri Lankan village, people carrying
straw mats, pillows and blankets leave their huts and trek to a
Buddhist temple to spend the night.
   Galmetiyawa, inhabited mostly by members of the majority
Sinhalese community, was attacked by separatist Tamil rebels at
dusk Monday. Fifteen villagers were killed.
   Now, residents sleep in the temple, fearing the attackers will
come again.
   The rebels, dressed in military uniforms, came out of nearby
jungle. In 30 minutes, they shot and killed four children, five
women and six men.
   Villagers said the rebels threw some of the victims' bodies into
a hut and set it on fire. A Sri Lankan army lieutenant and two
soldiers, who came to the village after hearing gunfire, chased the
rebels away.
   Marasinghe Ratnasiri, a member of a home guard that once
protected the village, complained that a peace accord with the
Tamils had taken away the local men's weapons.
   ``When we had guns, the rebels did not attack our village,''
said Marasinghe, 28, a farmer with two children. ``Now, they know
we are defenseless.''
   The rebels have been blamed for the killings of more than 110
people, most of them Sinhalese, in Sri Lanka's Eastern Province
this month as part of their bloody four-year campaign for a
separate homeland.
   Colonel Lakshman Wijayaratne, a Sri Lankan army officer, said
the spate of killings aims to halt a government resettlement
program aimed at encouraging Sinhalese to migrate to the north and
east.
   He predicted there would be more rebel attacks in reaction to
the settling of Sinhalese in what Tamils view as their traditional
homeland, saying it was not possible to protect every village in
the area.
   Many rebels fled to this part of the Indian Ocean island in
October, when Indian troops attacked the Tamil stronghold of Jaffna
in the north.
   India deployed soldiers in Sri Lanka to disarm the rebels after
they denounced a New Delhi-sponsored peace accord with Sri Lanka's
government aimed at ending the fighting by creating some measure of
autonomy in the north and east where Tamils are most numerous.
   Under the India-Sri Lanka peace accord signed in July, Sri
Lankan soldiers in the north and east are to keep to their barracks
while Indian troops take on the rebels.
   There are more than 50,000 Indian troops in Sri Lanka, but the
number in the Eastern Province is uncertain.
   Galmetiyawa is 30 miles west of the coastal city of Trincomalee.
Most of the recent killings have taken place around Trincomalee,
and 2,000 Sri Lankan soldiers are posted there along with Indian
soldiers.
   About 1,000 Tamil rebels are believed to be in the district.
   Tamils, who make up about 18 percent of the country's 16 million
people, claim they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese, who control the government and military.

   Rock star Boris Grebenshchikov has signed a
contract to cut an album of his songs with American musicians.
Soviet officials said it would be the first American-produced
Soviet rock album released in the United States.
   Grebenshchikov told a news conference Friday that his songs,
some in Russian and others in English, will be performed by his
group Aquarium and American musicians who are to be chosen later.
   Sporting a pony tail, blue jeans and six rings, Grebenshchikov
seemed ill at ease alongside American and Soviet officials in suits
who announced the deal. An earlier record on which he performed was
released in the United States without the Soviet government's
consent.
   Grebenshchikov is to record the album in New York and Los
Angeles this summer for CBS Records, which plans distribution in
the United States and Europe, said his American lawyer, Ina
Meibach. The record also will be released in the Soviet Union,
Soviet officials said.
   Kenneth Schaffer, vice president of New York-based Belka
International which helped put together the deal, said he was
confident Grebenshchikov will become popular in the United States.

   Two paramedics attempting to aid an injured man
were assaulted by three onlookers who apparently weren't satisfied
with the medical treatment being administered, authorities said.
   Carlos Rivera, 23, George Washington, 27, and Pchoi Diaz, 24,
were arrested Friday and charged with second-degree assault,
criminal mischief, resisting arrest and obstructing governmental
administration.
   According to a police account of the incident, the two Emergency
Medical Services workers were dispatched at 5:30 a.m. to treat a
man who had slashed his left wrist near midtown Manhattan.
   The workers, Darrel Hoover, 25, and Ottavio Olivieri, 39, were
attacked by three men who may have known the victim and ``felt the
EMS treatment was not to their satisfaction,'' said Sgt. John
Clifford, a police spokesman.
   As a result of the altercation, Hoover suffered a sprained wrist
and Olivieri's face was cut and bruised. They were treated at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center and released.
   In addition, one of two police officers who also responded to
the call was slightly injured when he crashed through a restaurant
window as he attempted to restrain one of the onlookers.
   The identity of the man who attempted suicide was not known. He
was also admitted to St. Luke's for treatment.

<HEAD>China Accuses Vietnam Of Setting Border Forest Ablaze</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnamese troops torched Chinese forests along
the border this week after an exchange of gunfire between the two
countries near disputed islands in the South China Sea, an official
report from China said.
   The fire began Wednesday near the Guangxi autonomous region
border town of Pingxiang, the domestic China News Service said in a
report appearing in Hong Kong today. Chinese troops battled the
blaze throughout the night, finally putting it out early Thursday,
the report said.
   It was the 25th time in the past five years that Vietnamese
troops situated across the Pingerguan Pass had set fire to Chinese
forests across the border, the news agency said.
   The report accused the Vietnamese of attempting to use
northwesterly winds Wednesday to fan the fire and ruin Guangxi's
Taqingshan forestry center during tree planting season. It said
Chinese troops saved 500 acres of forest with the help of a
3,000-yard fire lane built in July.
   The report did not say how much of the area was destroyed by the
fire.
   Tension between the neighboring Communist countries has been
mounting since gunfire was exchanged between Chinese and Vietnamese
vessels near disputed islands in the South China Sea on Monday.
   China acknowledged Wednesday it suffered an unspecified number
of casualties in the clash, and Vietnam said three of its vessels
were burned in the encounter in the Spratly Islands.

   Romantic comedies swept the top
movie-writing honors as the strikebound Writers Guild of America
handed out its 40th annual awards at a ceremony largely shunned by
studio executives.
   Steve Martin took best screenplay for ``Roxanne,'' an adaptation
of ``Cyrano de Bergerac'' by Edmund Rostand, while John Patrick
Shanley won best original screenwriting for ``Moonstruck.''
   CBS came away as the night's big winner, taking top honors in
seven categories, including best TV spot-news script.
   NBC and ABC each took four awards. The Public Broadcasting
System had three and Home Box Office won one for best
variety-music, award tribute or special event for ``Will Rogers:
Look Back in Laughter.''
   Neither Shanley nor Martin was on hand to accept the awards from
presenter Sylvester Stallone, who wore his ``Rambo''-length hair in
a ponytail.
   Martin's acceptance speech was read by an associate. In it, he
called Rostand ``a great first-draft guy.''
   Martin also provided an ``If-I-Lose'' speech. ``You pigs, you
idiots. You wouldn't know a good script if it walked up to you and
vomited on your shoes,'' his associate read as the audience rocked
with laughter.
   In addition to writing the script, Martin starred in
``Roxanne,'' a summer hit from Columbia Pictures, along with Daryl
Hannah.
   In ``Moonstruck,'' a darkly romantic film nominated for six
Academy Awards, Cher stars as an Italian widow in New York who
finds herself engaged to one man but in love with his brother.
   The dinner extravaganza came on the 11th day of a strike by the
9,000-member guild against the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers.
   References to the strike flavored the evening, despite guild
Executive Director Brian Walton's admonition, ``This is a night to
celebrate writers and writing.''
   But WGA President George Kirgo told the black-tie audience:
``The Writers Guild of America is stronger, more powerful, more
cohesive, more unified than at any other time in our history.''
   Studios were conspicuously absent from the banquet tables. Only
Columbia and 20th Century Fox were represented.
   Before the dinner, the WGA announced winners of special awards
from its Board of Directors.
   The husband-and-wife screenwriting team of Irving Ravetch and
Harriet Frank won the prized Screen Laurel Award honoring them for
their body of work, which includes such movies as ``Norma Rae,''
``Hud'' and ``Murphy's Romance.''
   Longtime television writing team Bob Schiller and Bob Weiskopf,
who wrote over the past 35 years for such series as ``I Love
Lucy,'' ``All In The Family,'' ``Maude'' and ``The Red Skelton
Show,'' were named co-winners of the Paddy Chayevsky Laurel Award
for Television.
   The award goes to a writer who has advanced the literature of
television and made outstanding contributions as a television
writer.

<HEAD>Jane's Says India Has Control of Sri Lanka But With Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India may have to maintain a military presence in
Sri Lanka ``for many months, if not years to come,'' according to
Jane's Defense Weekly.
   The authoritative magazine said in this week's issue that India
has an armed force of 65,000 in Sri Lanka under an accord to disarm
Tamil separatists, and almost total control of the island country
off India's southern coast.
   It added the Indian army has suffered considerable casualties
and a host of problems in trying to keep peace, and its mission is
far from over.
   The magazine said ``India's influence on Sri Lanka is now total
and even in matters of foreign policy, Sri Lanka is controlled from
New Delhi.''
   But ``in spite of having considerable numbers of troops, the
Indian peacekeeping force has problems in neutralizing the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam.'' The Tigers are the main Tamil
guerrilla group waging a four-year war for creation of a separate
state in northern and eastern Sri Lanka.
   India, which has a politically powerful Tamil population of 60
million in its southern regions, sent a military force to Sri Lanka
last July under a peace agreement signed with the Sri Lankan
government.
   Under the accord, limited autonomy would be given to the Tamils
in exchange for an arms surrender by the guerrillas.
   The Sri Lankan army, mistrusted by Tamils because most officers
come from the majority Sinhalese population, was to stop fighting
the rebels. The Tamils, however, denounced the accord and have been
fighting the Indian troops.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people and the Buddhist Sinhalese 75 percent.
   Jane's said India has six divisional headquarters, at least 15
brigades, and paramilitary, parachute, police and other forces in
Sri Lanka.
   It said 500 Indian soldiers have been killed and an estimated
2,500 wounded. India has said 400 soldiers and at least 1,100
rebels have been killed died in the fighting.
   Jane's said the Indians' high casualty rate could be attributed
to the army's desire to avoid civilian casualties, its lack of
experience in fighting guerrillas and its ``politically motivated''
orders to move as quickly as possible.
   ``This resulted in troops being committed to operations within
hours of landing in unfamiliar territory,'' the article said.

   From Maine to California, opponents of the deployment of U.S.
troops in Honduras staged demonstrations that blocked traffic,
damaged a military recruitment center and prompted nearly 400
arrests.
   More than 500 protesters, chanting and waving signs, obstructed
the entrance to the Federal Building in San Francisco and stopped
traffic during a five-hour demonstration Friday. Police arrested
250 of them for failure to disperse at an unlawful assembly, said
police Sgt. Dave Ambrose.
   Violence erupted sporadically at the second demonstration in two
days when protesters tried to grab police batons and other
equipment. Officers lashed back, jamming the batons in the
demonstrators' faces, stomachs and chests.
   Another 1,000 demonstrators, gathered by a coalition of San
Francisco's gay and lesbian groups, stopped traffic Friday night on
Market Street.
   About two dozen police on motorcycles kept the marchers moving
as motorists delayed by the demonstration honked, some in
frustration, some in support.
   About 1,500 people marched from Times Square to the United
Nations in New York in a hastily organized protest Friday night.
Two people were arrested for disorderly conduct, said Sgt. Edward
Burns, a police spokesman.
   Police blocked rush-hour traffic along the route to accommodate
the protest.
   In Los Angeles, about 75 demonstrators gathered at the federal
office building. Twenty-five were arrested for refusing to leave
the lobby when the building closed for the day and were cited for
trespassing, a misdemeanor.
   Federal police in Sacramento, Calif., arrested 29 demonstrators
outside the Federal Building, where 275 people gathered. At Fresno
State University, about 150 people rallied.
   Former President Jimmy Carter joined the opposition to President
Reagan's deployment of the soldiers in the war-torn region.
   ``It think it is a serious mistake. It's another example of
where President Reagan is exaggerating the situation for his own
purposes,'' Carter said Friday in New Orleans after addressing a
conference of university presidents.
   In Chicago, 60 protesters out of a crowd of about 400 were
arrested on misdemeanor disorderly conduct charges after they
pasted orange stickers on windows at the federal building and sat
in intersections, police said. Many of the stickers bore
skull-and-crossbone symbols and the message ``Stop U.S.
intervention in Central America.''
   Protesters in Minneapolis hurled bowling balls, eggs and paint
at a military recruitment building, broke four windows and ripped
up a uniformed mannequin. Scuffles broke out between protesters and
counterdemonstrators, but there were no arrests or injuries, police
said.
   In Washington, 150 to 200 people demonstrated outside the White
House, said police Officer Tom Randolph. Twenty-four were arrested
after the protest spilled into Pennsylvania Avenue and were fined
$25 for disorderly conduct.
   In Portland, Ore., Millie Thayer, a member of the Portland
Central America Solidarity Committee, told about 200 protesters
that Reagan is risking more than military failure.
   ``We may be facing the presence of another Vietnam, but the
Reagan administration is facing a solidarity movement stronger,
deeper and more diverse than the Vietnam movement ever was,'' she
said. ``We don't have to wait for the body bags to come back before
we begin our protest.''
   In Boston, about 10 demonstrators were removed from a U.S. Navy
recruitment center Friday afternoon. None was arrested.
   More than 100 people marched in the Nicaraguan immigrant enclave
of Sweetwater, Fla., with signs supporting U.S. policy and
mutilated an effigy of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.
   About 200 people gathered at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine,
and at Augusta, Maine, about 15 people quietly gathered at a busy
intersection holding signs saying ``Stop the Reagan War Machine''
and ``U.S. Troops Out of Honduras.''
   In Sioux Falls, S.D., about 70 people opposed to the troop
deployment demonstrated outside the main post office while a small
knot of people who supported the move shouted taunts through
bullhorns. Three were arrested.
   In Seattle, about 40 cars circled the federal building to show
their opposition to the troop movement, jamming streets for about
an hour.

   Drug dealers shot two of three boys they had
abducted to work for them after the boys apparently failed to pay
them for crack, police said.
   Joseph Jones, 12, told police he managed to escape from the
kidnappers early Friday. The boy said he was abducted last Saturday
by two young men from New York who forced him and his friends to
sell crack, a derivative of cocaine.
   The body of Cornell Williams, 15, was found Friday afternoon
near Philadelphia International Airport with two gunshot wounds in
the head, according to the city medical examiner's office.
   Williams' brother, Anthony Williams, 13, was found Tuesday along
railroad tracks near downtown Philadelphia with a bullet wound in
the head, police said. He died the next day.
   Joseph told police the boys owed their captors $500 for crack,
but the people to whom they delivered the crack in their housing
project never paid for it.
   When the boys returned with little crack left and what neighbors
said was just $68, the enraged dealers held the boys hostage,
police said.
   The dealers decided to kill Anthony Williams, who was classified
as socially and emotionally disturbed, when the boy filched drugs
while in captivity, detectives said.
   Joseph said he did not know what happened to Cornell after he
escaped, according to Detective Edward Tenuto.
   Police said they were searching for the two men they believed to
be the killers and a third man they believe aided in the abduction.
Police said two of the suspects are thought to be Jamaican.

   Three black policemen were
killed when two men opened fire with automatic rifles on a group of
people in the yard of a township west of Pretoria, police said
today.
   The attack Friday night in Atteridgeville was so sudden none of
the police fired back at their black attackers, who fled on foot,
said Police Lt. Col. Johan Labuschagne.
   He said it had not yet been established whether the policemen
were off-duty during the attack.
   Police said in a statement that two men who wore blue overalls
killed two officers at the scene, and wounded three other people,
one of them a police officer who died later at Kalafong Hospital.
   Meanwhile, police said they had captured two alleged terrorists
and two collaborators and seized some arms in roadblocks set up
Friday in central Transvaal province in an attempt to find those
responsible for a Krugersdorp car bomb that killed three black
people and injured 20 people on Thursday.
   Police refused to give details about the roadblock arrests, but
said none of those arrested were wanted in connection with the car
bomb.
   Meanwhile, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu issued a statement
in Cape Town condemning the car-bombing.
   He said: ``I deplore without equivocation acts such as this
week's car bombing, since all violence is evil, whether it is that
of a vicious system such as apartheid or the violence employed by
people who wish to overthrow apartheid ... I desperately hope the
day will come when the authorities realize that the only way to end
violence is to eradicate apartheid.''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   Iran fired a long-range missile into
Baghdad and said it pounded more than a dozen other Iraqi targets
with artillery after Iraq launched new air raids on cities in
western Iran.
   The attacks followed a day in which the warring countries
reported blasting each other's cities with more than 40 missiles
and attacking other targets on land and in the Persian Gulf.
   Iraq, acknowledging today's attack on Baghdad, said the missile
crashed in a ``purely residential'' neighborhood. Baghdad Radio
said several civilians were killed in the blast shortly after
midnight but gave no casualty figures.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said the missile
was fired at the Iraqi Army's ``command headquarters in response to
their mischiefs.''
   IRNA reported 12 missiles fired into the southeastern Iraqi Umm
Qasr port, and one into Al-Amarah, a city 200 miles southeast of
Baghdad.
   It said Revolutionary Guards artillery units hammered a string
of cities and towns along the 730-mile war front, including Basra,
Iraq's already devastated southern port city.
   The attacks came after renewed Iraqi air raids today on the
western cities of Bakhtaran and Hamadan, as well as southwestern
Dezful, IRNA said. It gave no exact casualty count, but said ``many
civilians were martyred.''
   Bakhtaran also was hit at 11:30 p.m. Friday, IRNA said.
   Iran claimed its gunners fired a long-range missile into Tikrit
on Friday in the first attack on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
hometown since the resurgence of the war of the cities Feb. 29.
Iraq did not report any attack on Tikrit.
   Reports from both sides were monitored in Nicosia.
   Tikrit, on the Tigris river about 100 miles north of Baghdad, is
home to ``most members of the ruling clique in Baghdad,'' an IRNA
dispatch said.
   Other missiles on Friday hit the northern Iraqi cities of Mosul
and Kirkuk, the latter an important oil center.
   Six missiles pounded Basra, Iraq's second largest city, while 24
other projectiles were lobbed into the southern towns of Haretha,
Shubair, an industrial center just south of Basra.
   The official Iraqi News Agency reported seven missiles fired
into Tehran Friday, raising to 30 the number of such attacks on the
Iranian capital since Sunday. In all, Baghdad says it has fired 101
missiles into Tehran since the intercity dueling began Feb. 29.
   The Iranians also claimed they captured two towns Friday in a
five-day-old land offensive into northeast Iraq in which they said
9,200 Iraqis have been killed or wounded and 4,000 captured.
   They also said they recaptured the Iranian border town of
Nowsud, held by the Iraqis since the early days of the 7{-year-old
war.
   The Iraqi news agency, also monitored in Nicosia, has denied
there was combat in that region, where most of Iraq's 3.5 million
Kurds live.
   IRNA reported five Iraqi warplanes were shot down Thursday and
Friday, but Iraq confirmed only one jet downed.
   Iraq claimed two Iranian jets were shot down. IRNA denied the
report.
   The Iraqi agency said Iraqi warplanes hit two ``large maritime
targets,'' which usually means tankers, off Iran's coast on
Thursday and Friday.
   London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit confirmed only
one _ on the 80,137-ton Cypriot tanker Kyrenicos.
   Iranian gunboats attacked three neutral ships in the southern
gulf Friday.
   In one attack, a Japanese seaman was killed aboard the
Panamanian liquified gas carrier Maria II in the first raid around
midnight Thursday, shipping officials said on condition of
anonymity.
   Gunboats later attacked the 284,494-ton Norwegian tanker Berge
Lord, starting a small fire, and the 87,768-ton Singapore-flag
tanker Neptune Saburu. No casualties were reported in either attack.

   Soldiers gunned down a suspected
communist assassin during a shootout in the capital today, military
authorities said.
   The incident came a day after gunmen wounded a national police
major and three troopers in two attacks and a rebel chief
proclaimed an autonomous Moslem region in the southern Philippines.
   Lt. Pedro Vergara, investigation chief of the Philippine
Constabulary capital command, said the shootout occurred in
Manila's residential district of Santa Mesa.
   He said soldiers arrested the suspect, Miguel Jardin, 26, in the
nearby suburb of San Juan and confiscated a .45-caliber pistol from
him.
   Vergara said that while being transported to a military camp,
Jardin jumped out of the military jeep and drew another gun
concealed on his back, prompting the officers to shoot him.
   Vergara said Jardin is a suspected member of an urban-based
communist hit squad and has been under close watch by the military.
   On Friday, police said gunmen in a car fired on a vehicle
carrying Maj. Pepito Campos and his driver in suburban Quezon City.
Both were wounded but doctors said they were recovering.
   A captain of the paramilitary national police, the Philippine
Constabulary, was arrested for questioning, according to the
police. Campos is chief of the Special Investigations Division of
Manila's northern police district.
   In the other attack Friday, gunmen believed to be communist
rebels fired on a military car in suburban Taguig, wounding two
Constabulary troopers.
   Thousands of Moslems in the southern Philippines held marches
and rallies Friday celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Moro
National Liberation Front, largest of three rebel groups seeking an
independent Islamic state in the region.
   At a rally of about 100 Moslems in Taguig organizers broadcast a
taped statement by the Front's leader, Nur Misuari, who lives in
Saudi Arabia.
   He accused President Corazon Aquino of reneging on self-rule for
the 5 million Moslems and said the archipelago's central and
southern regions were under the ``unlawful and immoral hegemony''
of Luzon, the main Philippine island.
   Misuari declared the establishment of 20 federated states in
Mindanao and other southern islands as the homeland of the Moslem
minority.
   He claimed the foreign ministers of the 46-member Organization
of Islamic Conference, a worldwide Moslem federation, were
preparing to recommend full membership for the front at a meeting
next week in Amman, Jordan. It now has observer status.
   Phillipine officials have called full membership tantamount to
secession and said it could start a new war in the south.

   Gov. Evan Mecham has recanted an
accusation, made under oath while he testified at his impeachment
trial, that his former chief bodyguard stole a report from his
office.
   Moments after the Republican governor admitted Friday that he
lacked the proof he earlier claimed he had, a state official
testified the report had in fact been taken by one of Mecham's own
men, former state official Lee Watkins.
   ``I did not have the proof then and I do not have the proof
now'' that the missing report was taken by Department of Public
Safety Lt. Beau Johnson, the former head of the governor's security
detail, Mecham acknowledged in his third day of testimony before
the Senate.
   The governor did not apologize, but said he did not want to
leave senators with the wrong impression.
   In sworn testimony Thursday, the governor said he had ``had
complete confirmation that he (Johnson) was the one'' who took a
report on the DPS from then-chief of staff Jim Colter's desk and
turned it over to the DPS. Mecham testified that he had an
``informer'' within DPS.
   Johnson denied taking the report, and the DPS deputy director,
Lt. Col. Gary Phelps, told senators Friday it actually was taken by
Watkins, the former state prison construction chief.
   Watkins is accused of making a death threat against a former top
Mecham aide. One of the three impeachment articles against Mecham
charges the governor with trying to obstruct an investigation of
the alleged threat.
   Watkins, reached by telephone, denied that he took the report.
   Mecham fired Johnson from his security detail after the police
officer reported the alleged threat to his superiors.
   Republican Sen. Tony West, who had demanded that Mecham reveal
who accused Johnson of taking the report, admonished the governor.
``When you have careers, reputations at stake ... we have an
obligation to protect each and every ... reputation and career.''
   Mecham again insisted Friday that he did not know the alleged
death threat against former top aide Donna Carlson was a serious
matter. At the time, Ms. Carlson was about to testify before the
state grand jury about Mecham's failure to report a $350,000
campaign loan.
   The governor is accused of ordering DPS Director Ralph Milstead
not to cooperate with the attorney general's investigation of the
alleged threat.
   Testimony is expected to begin next week on the second
allegation against Mecham: that he misused $80,000 from the
governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. The
third impeachment article accuses him of concealing the $350,000
campaign loan.
   The governor also faces an April 21 criminal trial on charges of
hiding the campaign loan, and a May 17 recall election.
   A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is required to convict
Mecham, and lawmakers also could decide to bar him from holding any
future office. Mecham is the first U.S. governor to be impeached in
six decades and the first ever in Arizona.

   Cuba has presented the United States with
a proposed timetable for the withdrawal of its 40,000 troops
stationed in Angola, Angola said.
   U.S. negotiators left the Angolan capital Friday after 10 days
of talks with government authorities on efforts to secure peace in
southern Africa. American officials refused to comment on the
progress of the negotiations or on the timetable.
   In Lisbon, Portugal, a statement Friday by Cuba's Armed Forces
Ministry said 39 Cuban soldiers have been killed or wounded over
the past two months defending a key southern Angola town.
Anti-Marxist Angolan rebels also announced they had shot down a
Soviet-built Mi-17 helicopter in the region.
   The Foreign Ministry said Angola and a Cuban delegation
presented the United States with a proposed timetable for the
withdrawal of the 40,000 Cuban troops stationed in Angola.
   Officials in Luanda, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
U.S. assistant secretary of state, Chester Crocker, was expected to
pursue negotiations in Angola next week.
   The United States, which has been negotiating since 1981 for a
peace accord in the region, wants Cuba to pull out of Angola in
return for a South African withdrawal from neighboring South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia.
   Angola says it will not send the Cubans home until South African
troops withdraw from Angolan territory and cease all military
incursions. In addition, Angola wants an end to U.S. and South
African aid to Angolan rebels and the implementation of a U.N. plan
for Namibian independence.
   South Africa says the Cubans must leave Angola first.
   The Cuban statement, distributed to reporters in Lisbon, said
Cuba had sent infantry units, tanks and artillery to help defend
the garrison town of Cuito Cuanavale from South African attack.
   The town is a staging post for Angolan government offensives
against strongholds of the anti-Marxist National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA.
   Hundreds of Angolan troops were killed or wounded, the statement
said. Enemy forces also suffered heavy casualties, including
hundreds of South African and South-West African soldiers, it added.
   Angola estimates 9,000 South African troops are fighting in
Angola. UNITA, which also receives U.S. support, has been fighting
to share power in Angola's government since 1975, when it gained
independence from Portugal.
   UNITA claimed Friday that its guerrillas shot down a government
helicopter ferrying wounded Angolan army officers from Cuito
Cuanavale.
   The rebel statement said the helicopter crashed and killed all
aboard when it was hit by anti-aircraft fire Wednesday between
Cuito Cuanavale and Menongue, 100 miles to the west.

   A younger brother of former President
Chun Doo-hwan flew to Japan, airport officials said today, as
controversy raged about his alleged involvement in financial and
political scandals.
   Opposition leaders charged the government allowed Chun
Kyung-hwan to leave South Korea. A presidential official announced
that the government was considering summoning Chun back and
investigating the allegations.
   That announcement followed a request by the ex-president today
for a formal investigation into the scandals involving his younger
brother, said officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Chun, 46, left for Osaka Friday afternoon after booking a seat
under a false name, airport officials said.
   Under the former president, the younger Chun headed the New
Community Movement, a non-political campaign started in the 1970's
to modernize rural and urban areas.
   The younger Chun was allegedly involved in large-scale land
speculation and the abuse of power to exact money from businessmen
and force government agencies to divert funds to help his
organization.
   One report estimated the total amount of money involved at
between $60 million and $100 million.
   In an apparent move to defuse the controversy before next
month's legislative elections, government officials said they would
consider summoning Chun from abroad.
   ``The government may start a full-scale investigation into the
scandals, along with summoning Mr. Chun Kyung-hwan,'' a
high-ranking official at President Roh Tae-woo's presidential
office said.
   The younger Chun's sudden departure quickly became a political
issue as opposition parties charged that the Roh government helped
him out of the country to escape possible criminal prosecution.
   ``We strongly demand that the government immediately arrest the
criminal, put him to trial and get him due punishment,'' the major
opposition Reunfication Democratic Party said in a statement.
   The other major opposition Party for Peace and Democracy said
the case would test the morality of the newly inaugurated Roh
government.
   The younger Chun has never held a political office, but was
considered one of the most powerful figures in South Korean
politics.
   The scandals were not reported under the old government, which
put a tight lid on the news media. Local newspapers, which enjoy
more freedom with Roh's inauguration last month, began to report
details of the scandals.
   Roh, Chun Doo-hwan's chosen successor, defeated rival opposition
candidates Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung in December's
presidential election. Roh did not win a majority of the vote,
winning because the opposition vote was split.

   Talk about room service.
   When George M. Harris Jr. made his first visit to the Hotel
Pennsylvania in New York in March 1933, he was an unexpected but
welcome guest, coming into the world in Room 1032 with the
assistance of a hotel doctor.
   On Friday, it was Harris' turn to be surprised.
   The staff of the hotel, now the New York Penta across from Penn
Station, marked his 55th birthday by giving Harris and his family a
party, complete with cake and champagne, and by putting them up in
the hotel's Presidential Suite for the weekend.
   ``I was born in this hotel and after this weekend I may die in
this hotel,'' Harris joked during the festivities.
   Edward W. Moles, the hotel's director of advertising and public
relations, said the hotel had hosted presidents, band leader Glenn
Miller and other notables, but Harris was the only guest born
there. He said employees had decided to go all out with a
celebration when they learned that Harris and his wife were coming
to the Big Apple for a visit.
   Harris and his wife, Shirley, were scheduled to go to New York
next week with a band from a Rocky Mount High School. Mrs. Harris
called for reservations and thought the story of her husband's
birth might get them a discount.
   Harris became a New Yorker when his mother, Winifred, gave birth
earlier than expected while traveling to Rocky Mount, 53 miles
northeast of Raleigh, with his father. Harris said his father, a
tobacco buyer, worked in Turkey most of the time but was returning
to Rocky Mount.
   ``It was a surprise to her,'' he said. ``They thought sure they
had plenty of time to get to Rocky Mount.''

   It was only appropriate that Kelly give
birth on St. Patrick's Day, but it still came as a surprise to
officials of the Oklahoma City zoo. They had no idea that the
16-year-old dolphin was pregnant.
   Kelly's been a real trouper with the Aquaticus performing
Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphin troupe since she came to the zoo in
October, and no one knew she was well along into her year-long
pregnancy, said zoo spokeswoman Emily Hopkins.
   But on Thursday, Kelly went into labor and her 3-foot-long,
45-pound daughter was born 45 minutes later at 4:20 p.m. Zoo
officials and trainers said the calf, as yet unnamed, appeared
healthy and normal.
   She swam immediately to the surface of the water to breathe and
then began swimming near her mother. The calf, which will nurse for
about 3 to 5 months, will grow to an adult size of about 350
pounds, Ms. Hopkins said.
   The dolphin birth was the first for landlocked Oklahoma, Ms.
Hopkins added.

   A Dutch embassy official has denied
reports that a ship released Friday by Venezuela carried a team
looking for sunken Nazi treasure.
   The vessel ``is simply a cruise ship and has nothing to do with
any treasure-hunting whatsoever,'' embassy spokesman Harry
Trouerbach said in a telephone interview.
   Earlier reports in Europe said the ship was carrying treasure
hunters in search of a World War II wreck.
   ``That is a fantastic story. It surely comes from a very
imaginative mind,'' Trouerbach said.
   The Plancius was released Friday afternoon and was bound for the
neighboring Netherlands Antilles island of Curacao, Trouerbach said
late Friday.
   The Venezuelan coast guard detained the ship a week agp off La
Blanquilla island, 170 miles northeast of Caracas. Venezuela
claimed it had illegaly entered its territorial waters.
   Trouerbach said it was allowed to leave La Guaira port at
Caracas once authorities determined it never actually entered
Venezuelan waters.
   The Plancius was taking its 40 passengers to Willemstad,
Curacao's main city, where they were scheduled to board a KLM plane
for the Netherlands, Trouerbach said.
   ``Most of the passengers are biologists, not treasure-hunters,''
he said.

   Sixty singers are to perform in the first round Sunday in the
``Mr. and Ms. Country Music America'' talent contest, sponsored by

Tenn.-based Holiday Inc.
   Ms. Wynette will preside over the finals and perform Monday

of the best male and female vocalist categories win $10,000 and a
recording contract.
   During Monday night's show, organizers plan to pass the hat for

financial difficulties, said Music City News General Manager John
Sturdivant.
   ``If people have a good time, we don't think they'd mind
dropping some money into a goldfish bowl,'' Sturdivant said. ``We

   Iraq said its warplanes blasted Iran's
vital oil center at Kharg island today, setting oil installations
and tankers ablaze. Iran fired long-range missiles into Baghdad and
other Iraqi cities.
   Iraq, acknowledging the attack on Baghdad, said the missile
crashed in a ``purely residential'' neighborhood of the capital.
Baghdad Radio said several civilians were killed in the missile
blast, but gave no figures.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said the missile was fired
at the Iraqi Army's ``command headquarters in response to their
mischief.''
   The Iranian news agency, monitored in Nicosia, also reported 12
missiles fired into the southeastern Iraqi Umm Qasr port, and one
into Al-Amarah, a city 200 miles southeast of Baghdad.
   An urgent dispatch, carried by the Iraqi News Agency, said large
formations of fighter-bombers attacked Kharg Island, on the
northern edge of the Persian Gulf, and a tanker holding area east
of the facility, in a ``daring'' raid.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a mlitary spokesman as
saying: ``Our pilots ... devastated their targets, setting
facilities on the island and several tankers nearby on fire.''
   The unnamed spokesman did not say whether all attacking planes
returned safely from the raid, and IRNA reported that Iranian jets
shot down an Iraqi aircraft in a dogfight over the Persian Gulf.
   Iran did not confirm the attack on Kharg.
   Kharg accounts for about 90 percent of Iran's oil exports. It
has been hit frequently in Iraqi air raids.
   The Iranian news agency said Revolutionary Guards artillery
units hammered a string of cities and towns along the 730-mile war
front, including Basra, Iraq's already devastated southern port
city.
   The attacks came after renewed Iraqi air raids today on the
western cities of Bakhtaran and Hamadan, as well as southwestern
Dezful, the Iranian news agency said. It gave no exact casualty
count, but said ``many civilians were martyred.''
   Iran claimed its gunners fired a long-range missile into Tikrit
on Friday in the first attack on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
hometown since the resurgence of the war of the cities Feb. 29.
Iraq did not report any attack on Tikrit.
   Tikrit, on the Tigris river about 100 miles north of Baghdad, is
home to ``most members of the ruling clique in Baghdad,'' an
Islamic Republic News Agency dispatch said.
   Other missiles on Friday hit the northern Iraqi cities of Mosul
and Kirkuk, the latter an important oil center.
   Six missiles pounded Basra, Iraq's second-largest city, while 24
other projectiles were lobbed into the southern towns of Haretha,
Shubair, an industrial center just south of Basra.
   The Iraqi News Agency reported seven missiles fired into Tehran
Friday, raising to 30 the number of such attacks on the Iranian
capital since Sunday. In all, Baghdad says it has fired 101
missiles into Tehran since the intercity dueling began Feb. 29.
   The Iranians also claimed they captured two towns Friday in a
five-day-old land offensive into northeast Iraq in which they said
9,200 Iraqis have been killed or wounded and 4,000 captured.
   They also said they recaptured the Iranian border town of
Nowsud, held by the Iraqis since the early days of the 7{-year-old
war.
   The Iraqi news agency has denied there was combat in that
region, where most of Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds live.
   The Iranian news agency reported five Iraqi warplanes were shot
down Thursday and Friday, but Iraq confirmed only one jet downed.
   Iraq claimed two Iranian jets were shot down. Iran denied the
report.
   The Iraqi agency said Iraqi warplanes hit two ``large maritime
targets,'' which usually means tankers, off Iran's coast on
Thursday and Friday.
   London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit confirmed only
one _ on the 80,137-ton Cypriot tanker Kyrenicos.
   Iranian gunboats attacked three neutral ships in the southern
gulf Friday.
   In one attack, a Japanese seaman was killed aboard the
Panamanian liquified gas carrier Maria II in the first raid around
midnight Thursday, shipping officials said on condition of
anonymity.
   Gunboats later attacked the 284,494-ton Norwegian tanker Berge
Lord, starting a small fire, and the 87,768-ton Singapore-flag
tanker Neptune Saburu. No casualties were reported in either attack.

<HEAD>Israeli Leader Says Peace Should Follow Approach of Camp David
Accords</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
winding up his six-day U.S. visit, said the best course for
bringing peace to the Middle East was charted in the 1978 Camp
David accords.
   In a speech Friday to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council,
Shamir praised the accords signed by Israel and Egypt under U.S.
auspices, although he opposed them 10 years ago as a member of
Israel's Parliament, the Knesset.
   As at Camp David, Shamir said, peace talks between Israel and
her Arab neighbors must be conducted directly and on an equal
footing.
   ``This approach is enshrined in the Camp David accords, to which
we remain committed,'' he said. ``They still provide a workable
blueprint for resolving issues between us and our Arab neighbors,
including the Palestinian Arabs.''
   During his visit, prime minister rebuffed a U.S. proposal for
peace negotiations in the region, saying the proposal for an
international conference would allow the Soviet Union ``to push a
settlement favorable to themselves and their Syrian clients.''
   The U.S. proposal was an attempt to accommodate Jordan's King
Hussein, who has refused to enter peace taks with Israel except at
an international conference.
   Shamir, whose Likud Bloc is opposed to the notion of trading
territory for peace because it feels this would leave the Jewish
state vulnerable to the Arab goal of destroying the Jewish state
altogether, also dismissed criticism about Israel's crackdown on
Palestinian rioting in the West Bank and Gaza. The violence in the
territories captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War has left 101
people dead.
   Despite the recent differences of opinion, Shamir said, ``the
basic relationship between Israel and the United States is as close
as ever, as strong as ever and as good as ever.''
   During Shamir's speech, about 250 Arab-Americans and their
supporters waved Palestinian flags and chanted slogans as they
demonstrated outside the Century Plaza Hotel. About 20 members of
the militant Jewish Defense League staged a counter-demonstration
outside the posh hotel, but there were no confrontations, violence
or arrests, said police Sgt. Larry McKinley.
   Shamir has sought to blunt criticism of his country's action in
the territories by some American Jews.
   He reiterated his view that the picture presented of the
Palestinian riots in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip has been
distorted by the media, and said Americans shouldn't confuse the
violence with U.S.-style civil rights activism.
   ``It is war. It is an extension of urban terrorism,'' he said,
defending his troops' use of rubber bullets, beatings and live
ammunition.
   Shamir returns to Israel tonight.

<TEXT>
   A dispute within the Amish community over
whether their horse-drawn vehicles should carry orange safety
reflectors has divided the normally close-knit society.
   Some who object to the orange, saying displays of such bright
colors are against their religion, are only willing to use a
hand-cut black metal triangle outlined with white reflective tape
to warn drivers of other vehicles.
   The sign rift runs so deeply that the so-called ``orange-sign''
and ``black-sign'' Amish now maintain separate churches.
Orange-sign Amish also have opened their homes and farms to tour
groups; the black-sign Amish have refused.
   The rift has led two families to leave the 60-family community
in southeastern Minnesota's Fillmore County and move to Michigan.
   ``They want their freedom,'' said Jacob Hershberger, a community
elder whose daughter and son-in-law moved to Michigan. ``I feel
really bad some of our group broke away. But they were making
trouble. If they hadn't made trouble with the orange signs, there
wouldn't be this other trouble.''
   State law requires the Amish to display orange reflectors on the
backs of their horse-drawn buggies and wagons at night and in fog,
and to carry it in the vehicle at all other times.
   But Hershberger and others object to the orange on religious
grounds. Those Amish, if they use any sign at all, use the
white-bordered black triangle, a device permissible only in the
daytime, and not in fog.
   ``I look at it this way,'' said Menno Mast, 24, an Amish
furniture maker from Mabel who has orange reflectors on his
vehicles. ``If the black sign was legal, I'd be willing to use it.
But instead of making trouble with you folks, I'd rather use red
(orange).
   ``I don't feel it's hard on my religion. I look at this: We have
red barns, and red stuff in the house. I don't have much difficulty
with that.''
   A bill that would have allowed the Amish to use their black
signs at night failed to clear a legislative committee this week.
   Hershberger said he'll refuse to pay any fines for violating the
sign law, risking a jail sentence.
   One Amish man spent a day in the Fillmore County jail last fall
for not paying his $22 fine.

<HEAD>U.S. Envoy Seeks Backing for American Peace Plan in Egypt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Special U.S. presidential envoy Philip Habib
arrived in the Egyptian capital today to seek Arab backing for an
American plan for peace in the Middle East.
   Habib met for an hour with Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
He told reporters afterward that he had briefed the Egyptian about
the status of the peace process but refused to give details.
   Abdel-Meguid said that Cairo's position ``has been to encourage
the United States to move for the peace process because we all in
this region are in need of peace.''
   An Egyptian government source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Habib was to meet with President Hosni Mubarak on
Sunday before continuing his swing.
   Mubarak has called the American plan ``encouraging'' but
suggested, without specifics, that some of its provisions be
elaborated.
   Habib's tour will take him to Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Morocco,
according to a Washington announcement Friday by State Department
spokesman Charles Redman.
   Redman said one aim of Habib's mission was to get views of
leaders in the four countries about the peace plan presented this
month by U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz during a regional
tour. Syria and Palestinian leaders rejected the plan and Jordan
criticized it.
   Redman said Habib also will brief Arab leaders on talks this
week in Washington between administration officials and Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who rejected key elements of the
plan.
   ``We are looking for an early response to our proposals from the
parties in the region,'' Redman said.
   The U.S. peace plan calls for a United Nations-sponsored
international conference. That meeting would give way by May 1 to
direct Arab-Israeli talks on a three-year transition period of
self-rule for 1.5 million Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Negotiations on the final status of the two territories,
occupied by the Israelis since the 1967 war, would be held in
December.
   Meanwhile, Egyptian Defense Minister Abdel-Halim Abu-Ghazala
flew to Washington today for a 10-day visit to discuss Egypt's arms
requirements under a 9-year-old aid program. U.S. military aid to
Egypt averages $1.3 billion a year in a program that began after
Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.

today.
   The New Nigerian newspaper, citing unidentified police sources,
said the four were arrested at the Nigerian Telecommunications

calls shortly after the shooting.
   The unidentified Iranians were arrested and held for
questioning, but they have not yet been directly linked to the
shooting, the sources said.
   Four Saudi Arabian teachers were fired upon by a gunman as they
left the Lagos Eko Hotel just after midnight on March 13. The car's
driver was shot twice in the chest, a passenger was wounded once in
the chest and a third was shot once in the back, police sources
said. A fourth teacher was unhurt.
   The three wounded Saudis were all Arabic teachers attached to
the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Lagos, said the New Nigerian.
   Police and Saudi Arabian Embassy officials have declined comment
on the shooting and arrests.

<HEAD>Oldest Breeding Gorilla In Captivity Dies At Chicago Zoo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROOKFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A massive brain tumor killed a
30-year-old western lowland gorilla believed to be the oldest
breeding male gorilla in captivity, say officials at the Brookfield
Zoo.
   Samson died Thursday at the zoo in suburban Chicago and an
autopsy later revealed the presence of the brain tumor, said
Brookfield spokeswoman Linda Elbert.
   He had sired four offspring at Brookfield, including an infant
born a week ago. A fifth is expected from a recent mating, Ms.
Elbert said.
   Samson, star of Brookfield's ``Tropic World'' exhibit, had been
in failing health for some time before an apparent stroke felled
him Tuesday, said Dr. Anne Baker, curator of primates. She said the
30005-pound gorilla regained consciousness only twice before his
death.
   ``We were a bit taken aback by his apparent stroke,'' Ms. Baker
said. ``After Tuesday we knew he was in a life-threatening
situation, but we had not expected that we would lose him as soon
as we did.''
   She said Samson had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis since
1980, and had been blind for about a month before his death.
   Samson came to Brookfield in 1980 from the Buffalo Zoological
Gardens in Buffalo, N.Y. Ms. Baker said he was captured in Africa
and arrived at the Buffalo zoo in 1962.
   ``Samson has left a lot of offspring here to continue the
genetic pool of these creatures,'' Ms. Elbert said. ``He was a
really, really beautiful animal.''
   Gorillas usually live 30 years to 40 years in captivity, she
said, and the record in captivity is 53 years.

<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gunman whose bullet paralyzed a
marathon runner in a freeway shooting last July has been sentenced
to the maximum 10-year prison term.
   A rash of similar confrontations, including several in which
victims were killed or injured, plagued Southern California last
summer. Incidents have been reported sporadically since then.
   Albert Carroll Morgan, 33, of Huntington Beach, who apologized
for shooting Paul Gary Nussbaum, was sentenced Friday to seven
years for shooting at an occupied vehicle and an additional three
years for infliction of great bodily injury.
   Morgan also was ordered to pay a maximum $10,000 to the victim
restitution fund by Orange County Superior Court Judge Jean
Rheinheimer.
   Morgan shot Nussbaum on July 18, 1987, while Nussbaum was
driving on the southbound Costa Mesa Freeway during rush-hour
traffic.
   Nussbaum, 29, confined to a wheelchair, said he was satisfied
with Morgan's sentence.
   ``I feel that he should spend the rest of his life in prison,''
said Nussbaum. ``But the judge did what she had to do. I'm really
glad he got the maximum.''
   A jury convicted Morgan in February of the felony charges of
voluntary manslaughter, assault with a firearm and shooting at an
inhabited vehicle.
   In another case, jurors began deliberations Friday in Compton in
the case of Ronald Elam, 28, who is charged with first-degree
murder, two counts of attempted murder and two counts of assault
with a deadly weapon in connection with an Aug. 17, 1987, roadway
shooting.

   A funeral crowd mourning the
death of an IRA guerrilla dragged two British soldiers from a car,
beat them with crowbars and stripped them naked, witnesses said.
Minutes later they were shot to death.
   Initial reports said the crowd believed the men were
plainclothes detectives who were spying on the funeral for Irish
Republican Army member Kevin Brady, who was killed earlier in the
week during another IRA funeral.
   Police later confirmed that the two men were plainclothes
British soldiers.
   Witnesses said the victims fired shots in the air in an
unsuccessful attempt to extricate themselves from the crowd, but it
overwelmed them.
   Some witnesses said the soldiers were beaten and driven away in
a taxi and their bodies, stripped naked, were found later at an
abandoned lot.
   Others said the soldiers were not driven away but stripped naked
by the crowd, bundled unconscious onto a wall surrounding a soccer
field and then dragged behind a building and shot.
   It was not clear whether the men were shot by mourners or by
other assailants.
   Officials of Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the IRA,
said papers were found on the men identifying them as British army
personnel. They said the men were killed with their own pistols.
   There were reports that a priest was seen trying to give one of
the victims mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and being ordered away by
the gunmen who then pumped more shots into the men.
   After the men were killed, witnesses said the cortege continued
toward Milltown Cemetery with some people weeping and trembling as
they walked.
   It was the second time in three days that funerals of IRA
members have been disrupted by violence. On Thursday, a Protestant
gunman fired shots and tossed grenades into a crowd of mourners,
killing three and wounding 68.
   Brady was shot as he and other mourners chased the attacker. The
enraged crowd finally grabbed 33-year-old Michael Stone when his
gun jammed. They severely beat him before police caught up and took
him into custody.
   Stone is under armed guard in a hospital, being treated for the
injuries he received at the hands of his pursuers. Police have
arrested a second person believed linked to the shooting.
   Police said Friday that Stone will be formally charged next week
with murder in connection with the cemetery attack and other
unrelated serious crimes.
   Press Association said Stone was being questioned about 10
sectarian killings unrelated to Wednesday's attack.
   On Friday, West Belfast Catholics buried two other victims of
sectarian violence. One was 20-year-old Thomas McErlean, another of
the three people killed in Wednesday's attack at Milltown cemetery.
   The other buried Friday was Charles McGrillen, who was shot
Monday outside a Belfast supermarket. The Ulster Freedom Fighters,
an outlawed Protestant extremist group, claimed responsibility for
killing him in a statement Friday.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to drive the British from Northern
Ireland. The mainly Catholic guerrilla group wants to unite the
predominantly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Catholic
Irish Republic under socialist rule.
   Protestant militants reject unity with the Irish Republic.

   The Israeli army detained two American
television crews for an hour today after they refused to leave the
West Bank city of Ramallah when protests broke out, a crew member
and a military spokesman said.
   Scattered protests were reported in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
but there were no reports of shootings. Hospital officials in Gaza
City said nine Palestinians were admitted with beating injuries.
   Prime Mimister Yitzhak Shamir said he may let Israel's coalition
government collapse because of the rift over how to make peace with
the Arabs. Shamir said he was thinking about calling for early
elections.
   In an unusual move, soldiers in the West Bank City of Ramallah
detained four foreign TV crews, including crews from the CBS and
CNN networks, who refused to obey orders to leave the area.
   Eli Fastman, a cameraman for the London-based Visnews, said the
four crews had entered Ramallah in violation of an army order and
had stayed there ``to challenge this crazy system of closing us out
of the territories.''
   When protests broke out in Ramallah's central square, Fastman
said, the cameramen were approached by troops and told to leave,
but they refused.
   Fastman said he and the two-man crews from CBS, CNN and the
London-based Worldwide Television News were taken to a military
police station in Ramallah where they ``discussed the situation
with army officials.'' The army filed no charges and released the
crews an hour later, he said.
   An army spokesman confirmed the detentions but could provide no
details. Local area commanders in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are
empowered to close areas under their command at will.
   Shamir, meanwhile, revealed Friday that he was considering
supporting early electons.
   ``The internal situation in the government could be the main
reason for early elections,'' Shamir told Israel Television's
Washington correspondent. ``I am thinking about it ... I do not
rule out such a thing.''
   Troops killed two Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied
territories on Friday. The shootings brought to 102 the number of
Palestinians killed by U.N. count in anti-occupation violence since
it began Dec. 8. Hospital officials said at least 25 protesters
were wounded in scattered clashes.
   In Cyprus, U.N. officials announced that more than 400
Palestinian refugees had been injured in the occupied Gaza Strip
this week, bringing the casualty toll for March to more than 900.
   Troops killed a protester at the Shati refugee camp in Gaza
during a clash with hundreds of worshipers after noon prayers at
the camp's Al-Gharbi mosque, the army said.
   Officials at Gaza City's Shifa hospital identified the victim as
24-year-old Hani Abu Hamam. Witnesses said his family smuggled the
body out of the hospital for a burial service attended by about 100
angry mourners.
   In the occupied West Bank, a soldier shot and killed a
19-year-old protester who attacked him at the Ein Beit Ilmah camp
near Nablus, the army said. A spokeswoman said the protester had
assaulted the soldier with ``a dangerous object,'' but she would
not elaborate.
   Officials at Nablus' Ittihad hospital identified the victim as
Muhamed Mahmud Suleiman Khaled. Jehad Alawni, a nurse, said Khaled
bled to death from a bullet wound in the left thigh.
   Also Friday, two Israeli civilians were detained for allegedly
stockpiling an arsenal of weapons intended for anti-Arab attacks,
police said. Investigators determined the two had acted alone and
were not part of a larger ring, the daily Haaretz said.

   A Canadian engineer kidnapped last year
by Colombian guerrillas has been freed, police said today.
   Richard Paulson was released Friday near Beleen, a town in
Boyacaa state, and he came to Bogota by bus, according to Colombian
police.
   The National Liberation Army, a group inspired by Cuban leader
Fidel Castro, had asked $20 million in ransom for the engineer's
release. But it later reduced the amount to $6 million, said
Colombian journalist Alonso Heredia, correspondent for the El
Espectador newspaper.
   However, the journalist said he didn't know whether Paulson's
employer, Occidental Petroleum of Los Angeles, paid for his release.
   Heredia himself was kidnapped Tuesday and released Friday by the
same guerrilla group. He interviewed Paulson during his captivity.
   Paulson learned Spanish during his 376 days with the guerrillas
and received teaching in revolutionary objectives, said Heredia.
   The Canadian engineer was abducted in Arauca March 8, 1987, with
another employee of Occidental, Amanda Uribe, who was released a
few hours later with the ramson demand.
   Paulson worked as production manager for the giant Canno Limon
oil field along the Venezuelan border.
   The National Liberation Army attacked the Canno Limon pipeline
and the Occidental installations about 50 times in last two years.
Its demolition squads halted the exports of 180,000 barrels per day
during the month of January.
   The guerrilla group, the most active in Colombia, has vowed to
expel foreign oil companies working in joint ventures with the
state-owned company Ecopetrol.

   Federal regulators are reassuring nervous
depositors in the California-based Financial Corp. of America that
they won't lose money in any government action against the troubled
holding company.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Friday it would protect
all depositors and general creditors of American Savings & Loan
Association, FCA's main subsidiary. Normally deposit accounts are
only insured up to $100,000.
   The Irvine-based FCA, with $33.7 billion in assets, is the
nation's second-largest thrift holding company and the biggest
problem for the bank board, which regulates 3,150 savings
institutions.
   The pledge of support came after the company, in a report filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said for the first
time that American, based in Stockton, was insolvent under
generally accepted accounting principles.
   Karl Hoyle, a bank board spokesman, said the statement was made
in part to stem the drain of deposits at American. The bank board
also reaffirmed its support for the management of both the S&L and
its parent.
   FCA said American's net worth _ the difference between assets
and liabilities _ had fallen to negative $106 million at the end of
the year, compared with positive $244.4 million on Sept. 30.
   Under less stringent regulatory accounting guidelines,
American's net worth was plus $69 million at the end of 1987,
compared with $357.8 million at the end of the third quarter.
   FCA had previously revealed that its net worth had fallen into
the red, but this is the first disclosure that net worth at
American has fallen below the zero mark. That happened when
American concluded that repayment of debts due from its parent
company were not assured.
   FCA's annual report, filed with the SEC, also revealed that
depositors withdrew $493 million during the first two months of
this year. Deposits had totaled $17.1 billion at the end of 1987.
   The company attributed the drain to publicity about the bank's
problems and said it eased during the first 10 days of March.
   The drain was milder than the severe run at American in August
and September of 1984, when the bank lost about $6.8 billion of its
$25 billion in deposits.
   The bank board's sister agency for commercial banks, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., issued a similar promise on Thursday
protecting all depositors and general creditors of First
RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas, a bank holding company of about the
same size as FCA.
   However, the FDIC went a step further than the bank board by
pumping $1 billion into First RepublicBank.
   FCA on Feb. 23 asked for $1.5 billion in assistance as soon as
possible from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the bank board
unit that guarantees deposits. Hoyle said the request is under
review.
   The largest-ever government bailout of a banking company was the
$4.5 billion rescue in 1984 of Continental Illinois Corp.
   The bank board has tried unsuccessfully for nearly a year to
find another institution willing to take over all or part of FCA on
terms that wouldn't be too costly. On-again, off-again talks with
the thrift unit of Ford Motor Co. broke down early in January.
   On Jan. 27, FCA reported a loss of $224.6 million in the last
three months of last year, bringing its 1987 loss to $468 million.
   Two weeks later, the bank board ordered it to sell $2.5 billion
in mortgage-backed securities to reduce its vulnerability to
interest rate fluctuations.
   On March 9, the bank board passed a resolution reassuring
nervous Wall Street firms, which had lent more than $12 billion to
American in the form of reverse repurchase agreements.
   Ranked by assets, FCA is second among thrift holding companies
to H.F. Ahmanson & Co., the Los Angeles-based parent of Home
Savings of America.

<HEAD>High School Calm After 2 Days of Fights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLYMOUTH, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Calm has settled over Plymouth-Canton
High School following two days of fights between ``jocks'' and
``burnouts'' in a turf battle that some students say has overtones
of discrimination.
   Louise Gates, a spokeswoman at the suburban Detroit school, said
there was one minor scuffle Friday lasting about 10 minutes, but
order was restored quickly. Large-scale fist fights rocked the
school Wednesday and Thursday.
   ``Everything was pretty calm, maybe we've seen the end of the
disturbances,'' said a public safety officer, who declined to give
her name.
   Fights between the student-athletes and the so-called burnouts,
who students say are distinguished by their leather jackets and
concert T-shirts, erupted around noon Wednesday.
   Administrators said the fighting began over the use of a popular
hallway gathering place known as ``the Pit.''
   There were no injuries, but at least 12 students were suspended
and school officials sealed off the hallway, officials said.
   About 20 police officers were called to restore order Thursday.
Police declined to say how many officers were at the school Friday.
   Some students said administrators over-reacted to the fights.
   ``The amount of police that they brought in was outrageous. It
gave the kids a reason to keep going,'' said student Reeder Singler.
   ``The fighting is not really over turf, ... it's over
discrimination of one group over another,'' Singler said. The
burnouts feel the jocks receive preferential treatment by some
administrators and faculty, he said.
   On Thursday, the burnouts sent school Principal Thomas Tattan a
note that said: ``We feel we should be treated with the same
courtesy as other peer and social groups. We believe you're taking
the jocks' side over the Pit issue.''
   The burnouts and the jocks met Friday among themselves but the
meeting broke up when administrators tried to join in the
discussions, Singler said.
   Gates said administrators talked to both sides, but declined to
reveal what was discussed.

   The government controlled by Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega declared a state of emergency that suspended
civil liberties but gave the state powers to reopen banks and
stores closed by a cash crisis.
   Also Friday, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State William Walker
arrived to negotiate the departure of Noriega. In Washington, a
White House official said that if Noriega flees, the United States
will not seek his extradition to answer drug trafficking charges.
   The general's opponents responded to the emergency decree by
calling for an indefinite general strike starting Monday.
   The economy already is reeling from walkouts that intensified
this week and U.S. sanctions _ all part of an increasingly violent
campaign to drive Noriega from power.
   Under the ``state of urgency'' declared by acting President
Manuel Solis Palma, the government can suspend basic civil and
property rights.
   A government statement announcing the move blamed the nation's
economic chaos on the U.S.-backed freeze of its international bank
accounts and the opposition campaign: ``There is a real undeclared
war against the Republic of Panama.''
   Solis Palma was named to succeed Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was
ousted Feb. 26 by pro-Noriega legislators and went into hiding
after he tried to fire the general, who heads Panama's
15,000-strong Defense Forces.
   The United States recognizes Delvalle as Panama's legitimate
president and said Noriega must go after he was indicted by a
federal grand jury last month on charges of trafficking in
Colombian cocaine.
   Just hours after the emergency decree was issued on Friday,
troops broke into a radio station owned by opposition national
assemblyman Francisco Artola, arresting 12 people, Artola said.
   He said those arrested, including members of the opposition
umbrella group National Civic Crusade, were on the air discussing a
strike against a subsidiary of United Brands Co. in the town of
Changuinola.
   ``This man must go,'' Artola said of Noriega. ``The country must
democratize.''
   In a late evening news conference, Crusade leader Aurelio Barria
said another general strike was being called ``to put a halt to the
catastrophic national situation.''
   Asked about the negotiations aimed at facilitating Noriega's
departure, Barria would say only that the Crusade had been
approached by an Noriega intermediary. But he said his group
refuses to deal with the general or any of his representatives.
   Friday's decree allows the government to suspend virtually all
civil rights, from freedom of speech and assembly to habeas corpus.
   Also subject to controls is the right to private property. An
explanation accompanying the decree took special aim at the
scarcity of cash in the economy, signaling the possibility the
government would force the nation's 118 local and foreign-owned
banks to reopen.
   The banks were closed by the government March 3. Since then,
they have resisted government pressures to reopen, fearing a panic
run on their deposits.
   The United States has frozen Panamanian deposits in U.S. banks,
leaving the government and many private companies without the money
to pay their employees. Panama's official currency is the U.S.
dollar.
   Strikes have spread throughout the country in the past two
weeks, forcing the military to take direct control of many public
services to keep Panama functioning.
   Dock workers in Colon and Panama City maintained their strike
Friday, demanding full pay before going back to work. Many
government employees have accepted half pay or a flat $75 a week,
but dock workers union leader Luis Asprilla said his membership was
standing firm.
   In Washington, sources in the Reagan administration said Walker
went to Panama to discuss possible terms for Noriega's departure.
   One official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Walker
would tell Noriega the United States will not seek his extradition
on drug trafficking charges if he seeks asylum in a third country.
   Noriega says he is innocent of all charges.
   Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said today that Noriega
could be granted asylum in Spain or France to aid in bringing an
end to the Panamanian political crisis.
   Gonzalez spoke to reporters at Coto De Donana on Spain's
southern Atlantic coast before the start of a six-hour private
meeting with French President Francois Mitterrand. The French
leader did not speak to reporters.

   Strikes by ferry workers crippled weekend
travel between Britain and France on Saturday, jamming ports on
both sides of the English Channel with long lines of cars, buses
and trucks.
   The Dover Port Authority said separate strikes had reduced
sailings to the European continent by 75 percent. It advised casual
travelers to stay away.
   Ferries staffed by Belgian crews and traveling from Dover to
Belgium were departing normally, but only one passenger ferry still
was sailing to France, the port authority said.
   Early Saturday, there were about 250 cars and 100 buses waiting
inside the docks at Dover, but the pressure was relieved when some
of the cars were ferried to nearby Folkestone to cross the English
Channel to Boulogne, France.
   About 400 freight trucks also were jammed inside the Dover dock,
and 240 others lined up along a cordoned section of the expressway
leading into the port city.
   ``It's a pretty desperate situation,'' said a port official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Dover Harbor Board said travelers to the continent might
have to wait up 36 hours to make the crossing.
   About 2,200 employees of P and O European Ferries went on strike
six weeks ago to protest the company's plan to cut 400 jobs and
change work conditions.
   On Thursday, French crews of the British-French consortium
Sealink-SNCF walked off the job on both sides of the channel in a
separate protest over work practices.
   French workers are striking against a reduction in wages and an
increase in working hours.
   Port officials in France, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said some truck drivers who had been waiting for more than 72 hours
to cross temporarily abandoned their vehicles at Calais.
   Crews of three French ferries were on strike in Calais. The only
ferry making the crossing to Dover, England, was the Saint Anselm,
run by British Sealink.
   Departures continued from Cherbourg to Poole, England and from
Ouistreham.
   In Dieppe, the car-ferry Le Chartre had blocked the vehicle
access ramp to all ferries since Thursday, according to port
authorities. Ferry captain Gerard Delaunay has refused to allow
another ferry, the Versailles, to take on cars for the crossing to
Newhaven, England.

   Heavy wind and rain lashed the

plunging the city of 4 million into darkness, police said Saturday.
   At least 100 people were reported injured in the storm, which
hit late Friday, hospital officials said. Doctors said that 10
people were in critical condition.
   Police said the storm, with winds as high as 36 mph, ripped

<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush says it is too
early to discuss dropping the drug indictments against Panamanian
strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. Jesse Jackson says he favors
a guarantee of no extradition if that will speed up his departure.
   Other presidential candidates, in reponse to a survey by The
Associated Press, voiced support for U.S. efforts to force Noriega
to step down and end the crisis in Panama.
   Several Democrats faulted the Reagan administration for not
acting sooner.
   Pat Robertson, a Republican hopeful and former television
evangelist, said, ``Under no circumstances should a deal be made
whereby drug charges are dropped.''
   The AP asked the candidates last Tuesday if the United States
should impose a trade embargo on Panama to force Noriega out, if it
should drop drug charges against Noriega if that would hurry his
departure, and if there were conditions under which they would
annul the treaty giving Panama eventual control of the canal.
   All the candidates except Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., responded by
Friday.
   Only Robertson suggested the crisis was grounds for changing the
treaty.
   ``In light of the uncertainties and volatility of the situation
in Panama, I believe the U.S. should reconsider transferring
control of the canal,'' Robertson said.
   However, Bush said: ``we signed the treaty in good faith. The
canal is operating smoothly and we expect it to continue to operate
smoothly. We fully expect Panama to live up to its treaty
commitments.''
   Bush called the U.S. drug charges against Noriega ``a matter for
the judiciary and it is premature to discuss dropping indictments.''
   On a trade embargo, the vice president said: ``Noriega should go
and will go and the United States government is listening to the
Panamanian people and the legitimate government of Panama. We hope
this internal problem will soon be resolved.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis said he supports sanctions,
``but I don't believe that a trade embargo is necessary or
appropriate at this time.''
   ``Before we consider any action that would affect the criminal
proceedings against Noriega, it is essential that the American
people be given a full accounting of the past relationship between
Gen. Noriega and agencies and officials of the U.S. government,''
Dukakis said.
   Jackson said, ``Drugs are our No. 1 national security issue.
Apparently, Gen. Noriega is deeply involved in the international
drug trade. Therefore it is justified to use diplomatic and
economic pressure to push him out.''
   But Jackson added the United States should be acting in concert
``with our friends in the region'' and the Organization of American
States. ``When we act unilaterally, we fan the flame of nationalism
and undermine our effectiveness,'' he said.
   ``The administration's recent moves are to be supported, but we
lack moral authority, which undermines our diplomatic and economic
actions, because the administration failed to respond quickly and
forcefully when it first learned of Noriega's involvement in drug
traffic,'' Jackson said. ``Our weak policy has put the U.S. in
another crisis in Central America.''
   ``It is in our interest and that of the Panamanians to settle
the crisis with Noriega as quickly as possible. If that means
granting Noriega a guarantee of no-extradition, then it should be
granted,'' Jackson said.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said, ``I support the economic steps
taken last week against Noriega. The pressure must be kept on
Noriega so that he quickly steps aside and allows President
Delvalle to take over. If that happens, the U.S.-Panama
relationship will greatly improve, barring other revelations about
Panamanian drug dealings.''
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said, ``Supporting dictators does
not serve our interests. The lesson of the Shah and Somoza, and
before them Batista, and Diem, is that by sticking with dictators,
the United States sets the stage for the outcome we fear the most.''
   ``The days of the United States deciding who governs Panama are
over. We are not going back to the days before the Panama Canal
Treaty,'' Gephardt said. ``The days of military dictatorship in
Panama are also over. Gen. Noriega does not understand that history
has passed him by.''
   Gephardt ruled out dropping the drug indictments, saying, ``The
United States is a nation of laws. The rule of law cannot be
subordinated to political expediency.''
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., said through spokesman Arlie
Schardt that he supports a trade embargo and the possibility of
dropping the drug charges if that would speed up Noriega's
departure.
   Gore's spokesman added that it was hard to envision
circumstances that would justify annuling the treaty.

   A team of U.N. observers will visit
Nicaragua as soon as possible to investigate the tense border
situation with Honduras, a U.N. spokesman said Saturday.
   Mahbub Ahmad said Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
decided to send the team at Nicaragua's request. He said it would
include one poliitical officer from U.N. headquarters and a
still-undecided number of military observers.
   Diplomatic sources said the team was likely to inclkude two
military observers and probably would leave Tuesday. The observers
have not been named.
   The announcement followed a Security Council meeting Friday
night during which Nicaragua, Honduras and the United States traded
allegations over whether Sandinista troops are in Honduran
territory and who is responsible for the current conflict.
   Several Latin American speakers endorsed Nicaragua's call for a
neutral U.N. observer mission to visit the site of the border
clashes.
   Ahmad said there are no immediate plans to visit the Honduran
side of the border. Sources said no request had come from Honduras.
   Nicaragua has requested a joint mission by the U.N. and the
Organization of American States to investigate the border situation
and make recommendasntions on preventing further conflict.
   Honduras and the United States contend that Nicarguan troops
have attacked Contra bases in Honduras. Nicaragua has denied the
claim.
   Honduras has responded by attacking Nicaraguan forces around the
border area.

   Authorities evacuated 2,000 people
after firefighters were unable to extinguish a burning gas
container that threatened surrounding cylinders in a plant rocked
by a fatal blast the day before.
   The cylinder was found earlier Friday amid the ruins of the
Gollob Analytical Services chemical plant, where the explosion and
fire Thursday killed three men.
   ``It's just a waiting game right now,'' James Staples, a
spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection,
said Friday night. ``The slightest vibration could cause that
cylinder to turn into a fireball.''
   The cylinder was still a threat this morning, he said, and
people remained away from their homes.
   Authorities ordered the evacuation in a half-mile area
surrounding the plant out of concern that the flames would ignite
surrounding cylinders containing unknown gases.
   Nursing home patients were evacuated from the nearby Berkeley
Heights Convalescence Center on stretchers at about 8 p.m. and
residents from some 400 nearby homes also were ordered to leave as
a precaution, said Deputy Mayor Albert Boyance.
   Officials said some of the residents were staying with relatives
while others went to a nearby high school.
   The New Jersey Transit Authority discontinued passenger rail
service near the plant until at least Sunday. Passengers were to be
shuttled by bus.
   Staples said the flaming cylinder contained phosphine and
hydrogen. Authorities were planning to wait until all the gas
burned before attempting to move the cylinder.
   Investigators said the plant burst into flames Thursday after
another cylinder exploded outside the plant and became a
projectile, shooting into the building. Authorities were
investigating whether mislabeling or a contaminated gas may have
been the cause.
   A delivery man who was severely injured remained hospitalized in
fair condition Friday. He had a leg amputated and suffered shrapnel
wounds in the blast, said Doris Ortiz, a spokeswoman for University
Hospital in Newark.
   The evacuation followed a smaller evacuation earlier Friday of
an industrial area around the plant, said police Capt. Michael
Borsos.
   State environmental officials said authorities cleared the area
at lunchtime as a precaution since workers were preparing to remove
gas cylinders from the building and were not sure what they
contained.

<HEAD>Red Cross Says No Danger in Blood Screening Slip Up</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: NEW throughout with Red Cross denial of danger, additional
detail.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Red Cross said today that blood that
slipped through procedures against AIDS contamination was not
actually contaminated with the virus or posed no known health
hazard.
   Twenty-four questionable units of blood were erroneously shipped
last month from Red Cross centers in Washington and Nashville,
Tenn., to hospitals for use but were never given to any patients,
according to the Food and Drug Administration.
   ``While it should not have been shipped, it actually proved to
be HIV (AIDS virus) free, and a number of units underwent
processing that would inactivate the virus,'' said Gene Jeffers,
American Red Cross spokesman.
   He said there was ``no known health hazard associated with the
24 units of blood. We were very fortunate and lucked out in that
there was no human risk at all involved here.''
   However, he conceded when questioned that five of the units
tested positive for hepatitis B antigens and would have posed a
health risk had they been used in transfusions. However, they were
not used, he said.
   Ten of the units initially tested positive for HIV antibodies
but they underwent fractionation, which eliminated the danger of
any contamination, Jeffers said. Fractionation breaks the blood
down into components for specific uses.
   The remaining nine units were from donors who were unacceptable
because they previously tested ``false positive,'' but all the
actual units were tested safe, he said.
   The Washington Post reported today that federal officials
recovered the 24 units, each consisting of one pint, and were
``virtually certain'' all the questionable blood had been destroyed
or quarantined.
   ``None of the blood was transfused, and we were out of the gate
in a hurry, but of course it's a worrisome event,'' Dr. Frank E.
Young, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, told the
Post.
   Two senior officials of the Washington regional office of the
American Red Cross _ John McGraw and Frederick Darr _ have been
suspended with pay for 30 days pending an investigation of their
actions.
   ``The purpose of the suspension is to permit us to assign
someone to make recommendations'' said Richard Schubert, president
of the American Red Cross. ``Then we will decide what to do. We are
not in a position yet to take disciplinary action.''
   Schubert said no officials in the Nashville center had been
disciplined, but that the investigation there was continuing.
   Six of the questionable units of blood were from the Washington
center and the other 18 were from Nashville.
   The mistakes in Washington were detected after the chapter found
discrepancies during a routine audit and then contacted the FDA,
which conducted a more complete investigation. The Tennessee errors
were detected when the FDA began an audit after a woman sued local
blood bank officials because she became infected with the AIDS
virus through a previous blood transfusion.
   As a result of the errors, the FDA said it has increased its
periodic audits of the blood supply and instituted new training
procedures for blood bank employees.
   ``An ongoing investigation by FDA at the two blood centers has
revealed that standard operating procedures were not followed in
handling these blood products,'' the Public Health Service said in
a statement.
   ``The FDA and the Red Cross are continuing to investigate the
issue and monitor the recall to ensure that all suspect units of
blood products are identified and that appropriate follow-up action
taken,'' the service said.
   Dr. S. Gerald Sandler, associate vice president of the American
Red Cross, said that in 1987, more than 37 million tests were
conducted on the 6 million units of blood donated, which placed
increased demands on laboratory workers.
   ``We are seriously concerned about this, and we are implementing
additional efforts to help reduce potential human errors,'' Sandler
said.

   Lt. Col. Oliver North says he's retiring from
the Marine Corps because he may have to subpoena ``the highest
ranking officials in our government'' to defend himself against
charges in the Iran-Contra affair.
   North, making a brief appearance Friday at the office of
attorney Brendan Sullivan, said Sullivan had informed him ``that
the defense against these charges may require him to issue
subpoenas for the testimony and records of the highest ranking
officials in our government.''
   ``That strikes me as a course of action incompatible with my
continued service as a Marine officer,'' North said. ``Accordingly,
with great sadness, I have tendered my request to retire from the
Marine Corps.''
   White House Chief of Staff Howard H. Baker Jr., in an interview
taped Friday for the syndicated television program, ``John
McLaughlin's One on One,'' declined to say how President Reagan
would respond if subpoenaed.
   ``We haven't had to face that yet,'' Baker, who is a lawyer,
said. He recalled that former President Ford was subpoenaed in the
case of Squeaky Fromme, who was convicted in an attempt on his
life. Ford videotaped a deposition.
   Asked whether this was what Reagan would do, Baker said, ``The
president undoubtedly will cooperate with both the prosecution and
the defense. Now, how that translates into actual conduct remains
to be seen. We have to face that issue when it arrives.''
   North, who wore a civilian business suit in place of his usual
ribbon-bedecked Marine uniform, refused to answer questions after
reading the statement.
   But Pentagon sources said North, 44, had submitted his request
on Thursday, asking that he be allowed to retire effective May 1
when he will have completed 20 years of active military service.
   The request already has been approved by Gen. Alfred M. Gray,
the commandant of the Marine Corps, and is expected to receive
``routine'' approval Monday from the office of the Navy secretary,
the sources added.
   Twenty years is the minimum amount of service required to retire
from the military with a pension. With 20 years of service, North
is entitled to a pension totaling 50 percent of his base monthly
pay, or slightly over $22,000 a year.
   The Pentagon sources said North also had requested approval to
begin terminal leave, meaning he wants to use accumulated leave
benefits to stop working at his military post now instead of
waiting until May 1.
   ``That also should be approved routinely,'' said one source.
   North was reassigned to Marine Corps headquarters on the
planning staff in November 1986 after President Reagan fired him as
an aide to the National Security Council.
   North will become the second major figure in the Iran-Contra
scandal to retire from active military duty. Rear Adm. John
Poindexter, President Reagan's former national security adviser and
North's boss, exercised his right to retire from the Navy late last
year.
   North, Poindexter and two others were indicted by a federal
grand jury Wednesday on charges they conspired to divert Iranian
arms sales profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   The 23-count indictment, which also named retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard V. Secord and his business partner, Albert Hakim, said
the defendants organized, directed and concealed ``a program to
continue funding of and logistical and other support for military
and paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by the Contras'' at a time
U.S. law barred such action.
   After the indictment was returned, North vowed to fight the
charges, declaring: ``I did not commit any crime.''
   North, a much-decorated combat veteran of Vietnam and graduate
of the U.S. Naval Academy, testified last year before Congress that
he always believed he had the approval of his superiors to take the
actions he did.
   Poindexter, during his testimony before Congress, said he never
informed the president of his decision to divert arms sale profits
to the Contras.
   According to the Defense Department, the pension rights of North
and Poindexter are unlikely to be affected by the outcome of the
legal cases against them since both men served honorably for at
least 20 years.
   ``Generally speaking, a conviction does not affect eligibility
for a military pension,'' said Col. David Shea, a Pentagon
spokesman.

   Well-wishers waved good-bye Saturday to about 75
people who boarded a ``Citizens' Train'' bound for Washington,
D.C., where they intend to lobby for new national budget priorities.
   They will ask lawmakers to spend less for weapons and more for
improved housing, health care, education and care for the
environment.
   Several dozen people held a rally Friday, carrying signs with
messages such as: ``Citizens' Budget _ More for Children, Less for
Weapons.''
   About 75 people from Washington, 175 more from Oregon, 20 from
California and a few from other Western states planned to board
trains this weekend and meet in Chicago on Monday. The travelers
then will board a train later that day bound for Washington, D.C.
   While on board, riders will attend workshops on lobbying
strategies, the federal budget process, education, health care and
the Constitution. They'll be met by supporters at stops along the
way.
   They'll arrive Tuesday in Washington, where they plan to rally
on the Capitol steps and be greeted by astronomer Carl Sagan. Then
they'll scurry in different directions to try to meet with
congressmen, interest groups, peace lobbies and coalition leaders.
   Virginia Day, a peace activist and mother of five, is taking her
two youngest children, aged 9 months and 5 years, on the train with
her.
   ``I want to make sure they have a safe world,'' Ms. Day said.
She plans to focus on the Act for Better Child Care, which would
provide more day care services.
   ``Our government forgot that real security isn't based on
military might,'' Ms. Day said. ``It's based on a healthy
population that's well-educated, well-nourished, fully employed,
psychologically healthy and living in a clean environment.''
   The Citizens' Train plan was hatched by four women in Oregon two
years ago, who hope the campaign will impress American leaders.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh took a
riverboat gamble by steering a federal grand jury to a catch-all
indictment which includes charges that connote greed by the four
major Iran-Contra principals, legal experts say.
   Former prosecutors, interviewed by The Associated Press, said
the strategy may open a line of testimony that could draw out
sympathy for the defendants _ especially Lt. Col. Oliver L. North.
   For instance, North was accused of accepting an illegal gratuity
_ a $13,800 home security system _ from his key operative in the
Iran-Contra affair, Richard V. Secord.
   By including that particular charge, the experts said, the door
is open for North to repeat congressional testimony that he was
threatened by international terrorists including Abu Nidal.
   Defendants in the broad conspiracy indictment handed down last
week are North, a former National Security Council aide; his
onetime boss, former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter;
Secord, a retired Air Force major general; and his business
partner, Albert Hakim.
   Most of the 23 counts focus on the broad conspiracy to aid the
Nicaraguan Contras when such assistance was banned, and attempts to
cover up the activities.
   But several counts allege motives of personal gain by North and
the Secord-Hakim enterprise _ which carried out the logistics of
aiding the Nicaraguan Contras and secret sale of U.S. arms to Iran.
   There are charges that North received the illegal gratuity of a
death benefit education fund for his children; that he used Contra
traveler's checks for personal purchases, and that the Secord-Hakim
enterprise made enormous profits.
   North has already testified under congressional immunity that he
made a bad mistake when he accepted the home security system as a
gift, then tried to cover up the gratuity. But he said he was
motivated by fears for his family in the wake of threats against
him by terrorists, including Nidal. His explanation before the
Iran-Contra congressional committees won sympathy from many
Americans who watched the proceedings live on television.
   ``That charge opened up the ability of North to admit all kinds
of evidence on terrorist groups around the world,'' said Joseph
diGenova, until recently the U.S. attorney for the District of
Columbia and now a private attorney.
   He said it would open ``a Pandora's Box of national security
information. It may not show venality, but instead a legitimate
concern for North and his family.''
   At the congressional hearings, North also disavowed knowledge of
the $200,000 death benefit fund set up for his family with money
from the U.S. arms sales to Iran.
   He apologized for trying to cover up acceptance of the security
system, saying, it ``was probably the grossest misjudgment I have
made in my life.'' In cashing the traveler's checks for personal
items, North said he was reimbursing himself for money he paid out
of his own pocket for covert activities when a special fund ran dry.
   The experts said Walsh likely has anticipated that the
defendants will wrap themselves in a cloak of patriotism, and
contend they were following legitimate orders from top government
officials. They speculated Walsh used the allegations of greedy
motives in an attempt to overcome that defense.
   ``It's much easier to persuade a jury to convict somebody who
has been advancing his personal interest, which could mean
political interest, at the expense of other people or the national
treasury,'' said Philip Hyman, a Harvard professor and former chief
of the Justice Department's criminal division.
   ``You can show you're not dealing simply with misguided
patriots, that these are also men now receiving some personal
benefits along the way, wheeling and dealing in a way that gives
them a great deal of pleasure.''
   But Philip Lacovara, a former Watergate prosecutor, agreed that
``Some of these charges give a very clear platform for North in
particular to emphasize the sympathetic role he will portray to the
jury as one of leaders in America's fight against world terrorism.
   ``He will explain the security fence as a wholly justifiable
attempt to protect his family while he was on the front line
protecting America against forces of evil,'' Lacovara said.
   Lacovara said ``one of issues I'm sure the defense will raise
will be demands for production of highly classified information.
This is the age-old question of `graymail' _ a demand for
classified information to prevent the prosecution from proceeding
with the case because risks to national security might be unwise.''
   A federal law establishes courtroom procedures that look for
alternative ways of conveying the information, but a judge could
order it released in open court if he deems it essential to protect
a defendant's rights. This leaves the prosecution with the dilemma
of whether to proceed, and can tie the case in knots.
   Another former Watergate prosecutor, Richard Ben-Veniste, said
the 101-page indictment _ combining charges of personal gain with
difficult issues like separation of powers _ could be too
complicated for jurors.
   ``My own philosophy was to be as streamlined and direct as
possible,'' he said. ``This indictment looks to me a little more of
the kitchen sink philosophy.''

<HEAD>Dissent Remains Rare As Nepal Grapples With Social Problems</HEAD>
<HEAD>AN AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LABELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is a directive for discipline from
Nepal's monarch, one of the many edicts written on red-and-yellow
signs and sprinkled throughout Katmandu. ``Speak the truth, perform
your dharma, do not fall from self-studies,'' it says.
   The dharma _ or cosmic order _ remains largely undisturbed in
Nepal. Tourists still spend money, foreign aid rolls in, and
criticism of King Birendra remains taboo.
   Rarely is the harmony upset. In the past few months, the only
public dissent has been an unsuccessful call for a general strike
and criticism from a handful of outspoken officials who later were
suspended from their jobs.
   But something is amiss amid the majesty of Nepal's mountains.
Half the 17 million residents live in poverty, only 2 percent have
sanitary sewage disposal and more than 70 percent are without safe
drinking water.
   A Nepalese born today has an average life expectancy of 47 years.
   Some blame lack of progress on meager resources. Some blame the
country's unusual government, under which political parties are
banned.
   But not even massive foreign aid _ $500 million this year _
makes much dent in Nepal's troubles.
   Not all the statistics are depressing. Life expectancy at birth
is up from 38 years in 1960. Some 70,000 Nepalese students are in
college. Tourism grew 23 percent last year, to 223,000 visitors.
   But the population is expected to jump to 24 million by the year
2000, and food production can't match it. World Bank figures show
Nepal's farms met all demands for food in 1960 but now meet only 86
percent of the nation's needs.
   Despite efforts to add jobs, one-fifth of the people have 60
percent of the private income. The bottom fifth has less than 5
percent. Per capita annual income is $160.
   Harkha Gurung, a former cabinet minister, said only about 60
percent of foreign aid that is offered can actually be used because
much of the population lives in the so-called middle hills, which
are largely inaccessible.
   ``Shortage of food and surplus of population has always been a
problem in the middle hills,'' Gurung said. ``Now they have reached
a saturation point. They can't support any more people.''
   Gurung, educated as a geographer, said Nepal's landlocked
position between India and China also blocks development. The
country's best untapped resource is hydroelectricity from its
rivers, but the only possible customer is its huge southern
neighbor, India.
   India also has come to dominate Nepal's two growth industries,
tourism and garment making. One foreign observer said Indians
``either own or control much of the cash economy'' of the country.
   But no one doubts the authority of the king.
   In Nepal, the king is advised by the Rastriya Panchayat, or
non-partisan parliament. Political parties were outlawed in 1961.
The parliament has 112 elected members and 28 appointed by the
king, with the prime minister chosen by the members.
   Nav Raj Subedi, the Panchayat chairman, noted no king has found
it necessary to veto a law passed by parliament. He insisted
dissent was welcome, but added that criticizing the partyless
system was not allowed.
   Of the dozen officials suspended last year, one was a member of
parliament who demanded a return of political parties and 11 others
were local officials who boycotted National Day ceremonies last
December.
   A strike against the suspensions was called in January by the
outlawed Nepalese Congress Party, but party officials say the
action flopped when 250 organizers were arrested. They were later
freed.
   The punishment can be more severe. A report last November by the
human rights organization Amnesty International said up to 100
political prisoners are in jail at any given time, with some kept
tied or caged as a means of torture.
   Even more staunchly forbidden is criticism of the king. One
leader in an outlawed party railed against Nepal's political
system, but turned suddenly thoughtful when asked about the monarch.
   ``Our law says we can't speak anything against the king, so we
don't say anything against the king,'' he said.

<HEAD>Five Members Of Sikh Family Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sikh militants Saturday sneaked into an
Indian farmhouse and killed five members of a Sikh family as they
slept, including a 2-year-old girl, police said.
   The killings brought to 16 the number of people believed killed
by Sikh extremists during the past two days in India's northern
Punjab state, police and news reports said.
   At least 13 of the victims were Sikhs. This year, 486 killings
have been blamed on Sikh militants fighting for a separate homeland
in Punjab.
   Balbir Singh, a farmer, and four members of his family were shot
and killed early Saturday at Butt village 17 miles north of the
Sikh holy city of Amritsar, police said.
   The other victims were his wife, son, daughter-in-law and
2-year-old granddaughter. Izhar Alam, Amritsar district police
chief, said the victims were killed as they slept.
   The motive for the killings was not known, but the militants
have in the past killed fellow Sikhs who do not support their
separatist campaign.
   The United News of India said at least six other Sikhs were
killed in the district on Friday night. Three farmers were shot and
killed in separate attacks and the bodies of three Sikhs were found
at Manda village.
   Two unidentified bodies were found in nearby Janti village, the
news agency said.
   The body of a factory guard was found at Bawa village, also in
Amritsar district.
   In neighboring Jalandhar district, a farmer, Amrik Singh, was
shot and killed Friday night, UNI said. A Sikh woman, identified as
Gurdial Kaur, was killed Friday when militants opened fire at a
gathering in Ludhiana district in central Punjab, the news agency
said.
   At least 1,000 people were killed last year in the separatist
camapign, which has gone on four years. Sikhs form just 2 percent
of India's 800 million people but comprise a majority in Punjab
state.
   The militants claim that Sikhs are discriminated against by the
majority Hindu community, who form 80 percent of India's population.

<HEAD>Chinese President Accuses Dalai Lama Of Trying To Split Nation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Li Xiannian on Saturday accused the
Dalai Lama, exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists, of trying
to undermine the national unity of China.
   ``We have respect for the Dalai Lama, but he does not respect
China, his motherland,'' Li told a delegation from the Nepalese
parliament. ``He is actually trying to split the country up.''
   Li's remarks, carried by the official Xinhua News Agency, were
among the first by a senior Chinese official criticizing the Dalai
Lama following bloody anti-Chinese riots in the Tibetan capital of
Lhasa on March 5.
   The Xinhua report did not say whether Li directly linked the
Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in northern India, to the riots.
China blamed followers of the Dalai Lama for instigating similar
pro-independence disturbances in Lhasa last September and October.
   Li told the Nepalese visitors that the principle of unity rather
than ``crude tactics'' must be used to settle problems concerning
religion or nationality.
   ``The crude and leftist policies formulated during the Cultural
Revolution have long since been corrected. The central authorities
have adopted a policy of unity and mutual help. Another important
principle is that the more than 50 nationalities in China should be
united,'' he said.
   During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, leftists destroyed
Tibetan temples and suppressed the languages and customs of
Tibetans and other minority groups. Although Beijing has tried to
make amends by restoring temples and promoting local autonomy,
resentment against the Chinese remains strong.
   The Dalai Lama fled to India with about 100,000 followers after
an unsuccessful uprising against Chinese troops in 1959. He is
still widely revered in Tibet.
   China says one policeman was killed during the March 5 riots,
which were led by monks shouting slogans in support of the Dalai
Lama and independence. Unconfirmed reports from Western travelers
in Lhasa have put the death toll much higher, with one traveler
quoting Tibetans as saying 21 Tibetans and three police died in the
clash.
   There have also been widespread reports of mass arrests, but
China's official media have given no figures.
   The Dalai Lama, following the March 5 disturbances, issued a
statement praising the courage of Tibetans who stood up to Chinese
rule and said that ``even in the face of mounting Tibetan
resentment the Chinese leadership still fails to understand the
true aspirations of the Tibetan people.''
   He also appealed to Tibetans to restrain from violence.
   Li thanked the Nepalese delegation for making it possible for
10,000 Tibetans to live in Nepal, and Nepalese parliament Chairman
Navraj Subedi said the Nepalese government will never allow those
Tibetans to do anything harmful to China, Xinhua reported.

<HEAD>Americans Get a Rare Glimpse into Soviet Military Minds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At their first encounter, Soviet
Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov reminded the senior Pentagon
officials he met last week of a giant Kodiak bear _ big, rough and
gruff, with distinctive Russian features.
   ``He's a real ground-thumper, a real Soviet infantry officer,''
one senior U.S. official said after Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci and his aides dined with Yazov. ``He seemed a little ill
at ease, not exactly cut out for this type of diplomacy.''
   But that view of Yazov changed Wednesday, during the first
business meeting ever conducted between the defense secretaries of
the superpowers. It was held in a small conference room at the U.S.
Embassy in the Swiss capital of Bern.
   Yazov, 64, showed the Americans why Kremlin leader Mikhail
Gorbachev summoned the four-star general back from his command
assignment in the Far East last May and appointed him defense
minister him over the heads of more senior candidates.
   Yazov appears committed to the task of convincing a skeptical
Soviet officer corps of the need for economic reforms. Soviet
advocates argue reforms may cut defense spending at first, but
could lead to technological progress that will ultimately benefit
the Red Army.
   ``They are desperate for `Detente 2,''' said a U.S. official,
explaining the Soviet rationale for the Yazov-Carlucci meeting.
``So they they trotted out their big, burly defense minister and
said, `Look. He's a teddy bear.' They wanted to convince us that
they are benign.''
   Yazov, wearing a business suit instead of his uniform, broke the
ice by noting how small the room was and recalling a Russian saying
that, ``although we have close quarters, we shouldn't quarrel.''
   ``Everyone got a laugh out of that,'' said Pentagon spokesman
Dan Howard. And although the talks weaved through a minefield of
explosive East-West issues, they remained, in Carlucci's words,
``cordial and businesslike.''
   Yazov delivered major statements from notes, but for the most
part spoke off the cuff, competently arguing the Kremlin position
on doctrine, force levels and tricky regional issues such as
Afghanistan and Nicaragua. He had the ability to defuse tense
moments with humor, when it suited him. Or start an argument, when
he wanted.
   On Wednesday afternoon, said a U.S. offical, Yazov ``pulled out
a map showing U.S. bases and fleets, and said, `You see how the
United States has us surrounded.'''
   Carlucci responded by ``referring to Cuba and Nicaragua, and
said, `You have got a beachhead yourselves,'' said a senior
Pentagon official, who like others interviewed, spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The three-day session was valuable for U.S. analysts. American
policymakers had already gotten a picture of Yazov based on his
meetings with the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, Jack Matlock. The
Americans who met Yazov were particularly interested in the aides
he brought with him.
   ``We have never seen most of these guys before,'' except for
Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov, the top Soviet military spokesmen on
arms control, said a veteran American on the team.
   The Americans included Defense and State Department
Kremlin-watchers as well as the top White House adviser on Soviet
affairs, former senior CIA analyst Fritz Ermath.
   Carlucci and Yazov did 90 percent of the talking, but they
appeared to make little headway in resolving such fundamental
disputes as who has the larger military.
   To settle the argument, Carlucci said at one point, ``the simple
thing would be to publish your military budget.''
   ``Yazov said, `well, it isn't all in one piece. It's as
difficult for us as for you''' to determine the exact level of
Soviet defense spending, recounted a senior U.S. official.
   The Americans pursued the point in less formal moments, and were
convinced that the Soviets ``really didn't know the size of the
budget or everything that was going on in their military
establishment,'' said another U.S. official.
   And Yazov didn't know everything his forces are doing.
   ``At one point, he complained about our ships collecting
electronic intelligence off their coast,'' said a senior U.S.
official.
   Carlucci responded that ``your spy ships are three miles off our
coast,'' just beyond the territorial limit, ``and they are welcome
there.''
   ``Yazov turned to an admiral (in the Soviet delegation), and
said, `Is that right?' And the admiral said, `Yeah, they're
there,''' said the U.S. official.
   Yazov kept his cool during tense moments, and showed no offense
when Carlucci demanded an apology for the fatal shooting, by a
Soviet soldier, of U.S. Army Major Arthur D. Nicholson in East
Germany three years ago. Yazov did not apologize, but promised to
re-examine the event.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega could
be granted political asylum in France or Spain if he is forced to
relinquish his power in Panama, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said
Saturday.
   Gonzalez spoke to reporters just before beginning a meeting with
French President Francois Mitterrand at this national park on
Spain's southern Atlantic coast.
   Gonzalez didn't elaborate on his statement, and Mitterrand did
not speak to reporters.
   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said it had no comment on
whether France was prepared to offer asylum to Noriega.
   Gonzalez reiterated an offer made last week. Spain said it would
be willing to admit Noriega, chief of the Panamanian military and
the country's de facto leader, provided he requested asylum and the
United States agreed not to seek his extradition on drug
trafficking charges.
   Noriega has denied the charges.
   The Noriega-dominated National Assembly ousted Panama's civilian
president, Eric Arturo Delvalle, on Feb. 25 after Delvalle ordered
Noriega to step down from his post.

   Terry Donald Hudson was no different
from a lot of the young men who cruised the streets and drive-in
restaurants of North Chattanooga in 1957.
   The 24-year-old liked souped-up cars and sometimes ran
moonshine, but then bootlegging wasn't uncommon in southeast
Tennessee.
   And when Hudson was gunned down in his car on July 20, 1957,
investigators thought he died as the result of a ``corn liquor''
feud.
   At the same time Bobby Hoppe was 22, the best football player in
town. The all-state halfback was preparing for his senior year at
Auburn University and later he played briefly for the San Francisco
49ers.
   So people were shocked when Hoppe, now athletic director at
Chattanooga State Technical Community College, was charged this
month with first-degree murder in the 30-year-old slaying.
   Authorities say it was police Detective Richard Heck, who was
just 5 at the time of the killing, who figured out what led to
Hudson's death.
   ``Dick has a good case,'' said Maj. John Taylor, head of the
homicide squad. ``He's done an exceptional job on this.''
   Heck reopened the case 14 months ago after he and Detective
Steve Angel were appointed to a special squad to investigate
unsolved murders.
   At a meeting of Families and Friends of Murder Victims, a
counseling group, Heck met Hudson's mother, Georgia.
   ``She realized we had other, more recent cases to work on,''
said Heck. ``But she said there hadn't been a day go by in 30 years
that she hadn't thought of her son's murder.''
   Heck refuses to discuss details, except to say that he has
obtained new evidence. Much of his basic information was gleaned
through news clippings at the public library, followed by
interviews with at least 45 people.
   Hudson was not a stranger to police. On the previous Monday, he
had been arrested for allegedly driving a ``liquor car'' that
overturned during a chase and was charged with transporting untaxed
liquor.
   ``He had some run-ins with them, but not too bad,'' Mrs. Hudson
said in a recent interview. ``He'd go racing a lot. He was good at
it. Of course, I didn't approve. I was afraid he'd get hurt.''
   ``Moonshine was really the big thing,'' said Taylor. ``This is
kind of the Bible Belt. We got churches on every corner, but people
drink liquor, too.
   ``To some young men then ... this was an exciting life, driving
a whiskey car. It was an adventure. Somebody who transported liquor
and drove a hot car was kind of a hero to some people.''
   Hudson was about a block from his parents' house when someone
pulled beside him and fired a .410-gauge shotgun through the
passenger window of his car, hitting him in the head.
   Investigators suspected a moonshine connection.
   But then they learned that Hudson had received a threatening
call two weeks earlier warning him to stay away from a woman. They
talked to Joan Hoppe Voiles, a former girlfriend with whom he had
recently broken up. Mrs. Voiles, a widow with a child, was Bobby
Hoppe's older sister.
   ``It was a hot and cold relationship,'' said Taylor. ``They had
their squabbles but they ended up getting back together most of the
time.''
   Mrs. Hudson agreed that her son's romance with Mrs. Voiles was
stormy.
   ``They said he beat her up, but I don't think so. She could beat
him up,'' said Mrs. Hudson. ``I don't know. She was bigger than he
was. ... He was just a little guy.''
   Heck acknowledged that both Mrs. Voiles and Hoppe refused to
talk with him. Hoppe and three other witnesses invoked their Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination at a coroner's inquest
after Hudson's death.
   Mrs. Hudson said she felt authorities in 1957 ``didn't seem to
be interested'' in pursuing the case. But Heck said, ``The best I
can tell, I don't think they had enough information at the time to
make an arrest.''
   Hoppe has declined to talk to reporters on the advice of his
attorney.
   Free on $7,500 bond, he is scheduled to stand trial June 21,
although his attorney, Leroy Phillips, has indicated he may
challenge the case because of the long delay in bringing charges.
   If Hoppe is convicted, he can only be sentenced to 20 years to
life in prison, because the state's 1957 death penalty law was
later declared unconstitutional.

   Jurors deliberating the fate of murder defendant
Robert Chambers Jr. for a second day asked to hear and see again
some of the evidence and testimony presented at the 11-week trial,
but did not reach a verdict.
   Chambers, 21, is charged with second-degree murder in the
strangulation of Jennifer Levin, 18, during an early morning tryst
in Central Park on Aug. 26, 1986.
   On Friday, forewoman Debra Cavanaugh sent Justice Howard Bell a
note from jurors at 2 p.m., expressing the desire to deliberate
until 8 p.m. However, the judge cut deliberations off at 6:30 p.m.,
and a few of the jurors seemed surprised by Bell's move.
   The jurors, who resumed deliberations nearly an hour late today,
at 11:20 a.m., have spent 15{ hours discussing the case. Chambers,
his family and lawyers were in the courtroom this morning awaiting
any word.
   The jurors also asked the judge for the transcript of a taped
telephone conversation between defense lawyer Jack Litman and Dr.
Werner Spitz, the chief medical examiner of Detroit who was the
prosecution's chief witness.
   However, the transcript had not been put into evidence and was
therefore not available to jurors. In the discussion, Litman sought
to recruit Spitz as a defense witness and Spitz declined. Litman
taped the call.
   Spitz testified for the prosecution that he believed Chambers
killed Miss Levin by using her blouse to strangle her. Chambers has
contended he killed her accidentally during sex. He said he was
reacting to the pain caused when she squeezed his genitals.
   During the afternoon Friday, jurors also asked for the
following: an enlarged picture of the crime scene; an X-ray of
Chambers' right hand, showing a fractured fifth metacarpal; and a
reading of the testimony of Dr. Allan Garber, a resident physician
at Bronx Lebanon Hospital.
   Garber, who jogged by while Chambers and Levin were under a tree
in Central Park, testified that he saw a white male sitting astride
another person under a tree 30 to 40 feet off the park's East
Drive. He testified that he encountered the same scene 15 to 20
minutes later, and assumed the people he saw were having sex.
   Jurors also asked Friday to see evidence they had seen on
Thursday _ Miss Levin's clothing and lipstick case, smaller
pictures of the crime scene, photos of Miss Levin at the bar she
left with Chambers and Chambers' written statement to the police.
   The jurors, who can also convict Chambers of manslaughter or
criminally negligent homicide, were given all the material they
requested, with the exception of the transcript not entered into
evidence.

   America's next national head count isn't until
1990, but the Census Bureau's dress rehearsal already is underway.
   The census tests are being conducted in St. Louis, and in east
central Missouri and eastern Washington state.
   Forms are being mailed to most residents of these areas, as was
done in 1970 and 1980, although census takers will visit households
in some sparsely settled areas. The effort is expected to continue
into the summer.
   The special counts are designed to be as much as possible like
the effort planned for 1990, in order to get an understanding of
what problems will develop before the work is begun nationwide,
Census Director John G. Keane said.
   Earlier tests were conducted in parts of New Jersey, Florida,
Mississippi and California. Questions on the forms, while similar
to those asked in the past, were developed in a series of more than

   For the woman who wants that `dressed to kill'
look, fashion accessories that conceal even the bulkiest firearm
are being modeled at the Bing Bang Boom gun show this weekend.
   ``This could only happen in Miami,'' said Ron Campos, who spent
several hours Friday testing some of the weapons at the Radisson
Centre show. ``Where else would you find a fashion show on how to
wear a concealed weapon?''
   The purpose of Friday's runway show and fashion displays
throughout the weekend is to attract women into the gun market,
said promoter Ted Walker, who is also spokesman for The Shotgun
News, a Nebraska trade magazine for gun enthusiasts.
   ``What we're trying to do is show the contemporary woman that
she can carry a concealed weapon and still look good,'' he said.
   One model wore a hair bow with a holster in it. Others displayed
gun-concealing purses and bras.
   Cindy McCall modeled several lines of handbags that hide a
pistol in a secret compartment.
   If you are accosted, she said, all you need to do is slip your
hand through the Velcro panel in the back of the purse, grab the
trigger and blast. The handbag is destroyed, but what is a $100
accessory when your life is at stake?
   ``Until I found these handbags, I would not carry a weapon with
me,'' Ms. McCall said. ``When I found these, I said to myself,
`Somebody finally did something that makes sense for women.'''
   The fashion show was narrated by Charlene Meriedy, who described
a horizontal shoulder holster as ``the perfect accessory for the
business women of the '80s.'' The holster is generally worn under a
jacket.
   Some 75 firearms fans applauded as the models walked by.
   Some of the gun dealers went along with the theme of the fashion
show by offering what they called ``Sweetheart Specials,'' such as
a .22-caliber Jennings pistol that can fit readily into a purse.

   Terry Donald Hudson was no different
from a lot of the young men who cruised the streets and drive-in
restaurants of North Chattanooga in 1957.
   The 24-year-old liked souped-up cars and sometimes ran
moonshine, but then bootlegging wasn't uncommon in southeast
Tennessee.
   And when Hudson was gunned down in his car on July 20, 1957,
investigators thought he died as the result of a ``corn liquor''
feud.
   At the same time Bobby Hoppe was 22, the best football player in
town. The all-state halfback was preparing for his senior year at
Auburn University and later he played briefly for the San Francisco
49ers.
   So people were shocked when Hoppe, now athletic director at
Chattanooga State Technical Community College, was charged this
month with first-degree murder in the 30-year-old slaying.
   Authorities say it was police Detective Richard Heck, who was
just 5 at the time of the killing, who figured out what led to
Hudson's death.
   ``Dick has a good case,'' said Maj. John Taylor, head of the
homicide squad. ``He's done an exceptional job on this.''
   Heck reopened the case 14 months ago after he and Detective
Steve Angel were appointed to a special squad to investigate
unsolved murders.
   At a meeting of Families and Friends of Murder Victims, a
counseling group, Heck met Hudson's mother, Georgia.
   ``She realized we had other, more recent cases to work on,''
said Heck. ``But she said there hadn't been a day go by in 30 years
that she hadn't thought of her son's murder.''
   Heck refuses to discuss details, except to say that he has
obtained new evidence. Much of his basic information was gleaned
through news clippings at the public library, followed by
interviews with at least 45 people.
   Hudson was not a stranger to police. On the previous Monday, he
had been arrested for allegedly driving a ``liquor car'' that
overturned during a chase and was charged with transporting untaxed
liquor.
   ``He had some run-ins with them, but not too bad,'' Mrs. Hudson
said in a recent interview. ``He'd go racing a lot. He was good at
it. Of course, I didn't approve. I was afraid he'd get hurt.''
   ``Moonshine was really the big thing,'' said Taylor. ``This is
kind of the Bible Belt. We got churches on every corner, but people
drink liquor, too.
   ``To some young men then ... this was an exciting life, driving
a whiskey car. It was an adventure. Somebody who transported liquor
and drove a hot car was kind of a hero to some people.''
   Hudson was about a block from his parents' house when someone
pulled beside him and fired a .410-gauge shotgun through the
passenger window of his car, hitting him in the head.
   Investigators suspected a moonshine connection.
   But then they learned that Hudson had received a threatening
call two weeks earlier warning him to stay away from a woman. They
talked to Joan Hoppe Voiles, a former girlfriend with whom he had
recently broken up. Mrs. Voiles, a widow with a child, was Bobby
Hoppe's older sister.
   ``It was a hot and cold relationship,'' said Taylor. ``They had
their squabbles but they ended up getting back together most of the
time.''
   Mrs. Hudson agreed that her son's romance with Mrs. Voiles was
stormy.
   ``They said he beat her up, but I don't think so. She could beat
him up,'' said Mrs. Hudson. ``I don't know. She was bigger than he
was. ... He was just a little guy.''
   Heck acknowledged that both Mrs. Voiles and Hoppe refused to
talk with him. Hoppe and three other witnesses invoked their Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination at a coroner's inquest
after Hudson's death.
   Mrs. Hudson said she felt authorities in 1957 ``didn't seem to
be interested'' in pursuing the case. But Heck said, ``The best I
can tell, I don't think they had enough information at the time to
make an arrest.''
   Hoppe has declined to talk to reporters on the advice of his
attorney.
   Free on $7,500 bond, he is scheduled to stand trial June 21,
although his attorney, Leroy Phillips, has indicated he may
challenge the case because of the long delay in bringing charges.
   If Hoppe is convicted, he can only be sentenced to 20 years to
life in prison, because the state's 1957 death penalty law was
later declared unconstitutional.

   Justice Department officials are encouraging
federal, state and local prosecution of drug users as an effective
way to reduce demand for cocaine, marijuana and other illegal
substances.
   Among the efforts being touted by department officials:
   _A border-crossing drug arrest program spearheaded by the U.S.
attorney's office in San Diego, Calif., is resulting in 10 to 20
drug-carrying motorists a week being arrested by U.S. Customs
Service agents and charged with possession under federal drug laws.
   _A recently enacted New Jersey law revokes the licenses of
drivers arrested with drugs in their cars. Also their cars are
confiscated and they must perform at least 100 hours of public
service work in addition to facing possible conviction for
possession, which carries a jail term and a fine.
   The National Drug Policy Board, a Cabinet-level group chaired by
Attorney General Edwin Meese III, Thursday approved a plan under
which authorities will arrest and prosecute anyone caught entering
the country with illegal drugs, no matter how small the amount.
   The idea of cracking down on users isn't a new one at the
federal level. It has been included in previous Reagan
administration anti-drug strategies. But the renewed emphasis on it
is recognition that ``we need to focus on the demand for drugs,'' a
Justice Department official said last week, speaking on condition
of anonymity. ``We're going to hammer this thing into specific
ideas and programs.''
   Arresting users at the federal level isn't expected to take up a
significant portion of resources because they will be ``picked off
the fringes'' of cocaine dealing operations and major drug
distribution rings already under investigation, says Assistant
Attorney General William Weld, head of the Justice Department's
criminal division.
   Weld said the approach will reinforce the point that ``there's
no such thing as recreational drug use.''
   The border-crossing drug-arrest program in San Diego being
pushed by U.S. Attorney Peter Nunez caught 900 people last year,
most of whom were permitted to plead guilty to a misdemeanor. They
avoided jail time but paid steep fines and many of them were first
offenders now saddled with criminal records.
   ``I think demand for drugs is the problem, not supply,'' says
Peter Nunez, the U.S. attorney in San Diego. ``We're trying to
figure out a way to get the message across to the users that they
are the problem and there are adverse consequences.''
   Justice Department officials regard some of the demand-side
programs in place in New Jersey under a recently enacted anti-drug
law as models that ought to be duplicated elsewhere.
   A New Jersey drug prevention education fund is financed with
drug users' fines. Dealers get extra prison time for selling near
schools. And the law's provisions yanking licenses and confiscating
cars of those in possession of drugs strikes terror in the hearts
of high school students.
   New Jersey Attorney General Cary Edwards says students' eyes
glaze over when he warns them they could go to jail for drug use,
an unlikely outcome for young first offenders. But they snap to
attention when he tells them they won't be able to drive.
   ``We have to teach the marginal users not to be users any way we
can,'' says Edwards. ``If society believes that law enforcement can
stop drug distribution, they're crazy. We have to dry the market
up.''

   Police say bleached bones uncovered in the
desert near the site where the bodies of five young women were
found buried are those of a woman who had a history of drug and
prostitution arrests.
   Using dental records, forensic experts Friday identified the
woman as Ivy Susanna Williams, 23, an El Paso resident who was
arrested a year ago on charges of prostitution and heroin
possession.
   Ms. Williams, who police say frequently moved from motel to
motel, was never reported missing.
   Homicide detectives investigating the deaths of the other five
women are ``still trying to piece together her (Ms. Williams')
activities,'' said police spokesman Sgt. John Loy.
   Police dogs searched the desert area around Ms. Williams' grave,
but found nothing Friday.
   A couple collecting aluminum cans stumbled on the exposed bones
Monday and reported their find to police.
   Authorities do not know when or how Ms. Williams died, Loy said.
The fact that she wore braces simplified identifying her remains,
he said.
   The five women whose bodies were found last fall have been
identified as Karen Baker, 20; Maria Rosa Casio, 24; Angelica
Frausto, 17; Dawn Smith, 14; and Desiree Wheatley, 15. They
disappeared between June and August 1987. All were El Paso
residents except Ms. Casio, who was from the Dallas suburb of
Addison.
   Police have said the deaths could be the work of a serial killer.
   Each of the six bodies has been found near dirt trails and
behind two or three creosote bushes in an area on the outskirts of
El Paso, about 18 miles northeast of downtown.
   Ms. Williams was jailed April 25, 1987, on a charge of
possession of heroin and was released on $3,000 bond, according to
El Paso County Jail records.
   On March 18, 1987, Ms. Williams was charged with prostitution
and solicitation of a beverage and was released from jail after
paying $500 bail, according to jail records.
   County clerk's records also indicate Ms. Williams had cases
pending from Sept. 2, 1986, on charges of prostitution and
possession of marijuana.

<HEAD>Candidates Turn to Brew and Lucky Charms in Search for Votes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strange and bizarre things, from
witchdoctor consultants to a beer shortage brought on by frantic
politicking, have marked the whirlwind campaign leading to Monday's
nationwide elections.
   Candidates plied voters with everything from roasted goat to
dancing troupes and gallons of brew. Plenty of hopefuls turned to
that old political standby: the fists of their supporters.
   One candidate reportedly hired a witchdoctor to help him win,
but the medicine man died while preparing his lucky charms.
   This eastern African nation's traditially rowdy politicking took
an especially raucous turn this year with scrapping of secret
ballots in preliminary voting and only six weeks to campaign.
   The 200-member Parliament is a rubber-stamp body, but candidates
campaign zealously anyway. Though subservient to the president,
parliamentarians have clout in their home constituencies. They're
also courted by merchants and enjoy benefits like free housing and
cars.
   At stake are 128 parliamentary seats and hundreds of municipal
jobs. It will be the fifth general election since Kenya gained
independence from Britain in 1963. Elections are generally held
every five years.
   Candidates were pared down in a Feb. 22 primary election. For
the first time, votes were tallied as voters stood in line behind
the candidate of their choice, or a picture of the candidate.
   The government adopted the system last year, saying it would end
voting abuses such as stuffing ballot boxes. But religious leaders
and legal groups argued it would lead to intimidation of voters.
   The general election is by secret ballot. It's open to all 5.6
million registered voters among Kenya's population of 22 million.
   Under Kenyan law, the president must be a member of Parliament,
and President Daniel arap Moi returned unopposed to Parliament and
his job as head of state after preliminary voting. He announced the
election dates Feb. 5.
   Since the campaigning began, Nairobi's three English-language
newspapers have carried daily accounts of fist fights, heckling,
alleged kidnappings of candidates and riot police quelling battles
between stone-throwing supporters of rival candidates.
   The Kenya Times said one unidentified parliamentary contender
resorted to a witchdoctor.
   ``The candidate is alleged to have taken the witchdoctor to his
home ... where he prepared some charms that would bring the
candidate good luck,'' said Kenya Times. ``However the witchdoctor,
known as Madego Mwarojo, died in the process of preparing the
charms.''
   Most parliamentary hopefuls instead charm voters with piles of
promises, gobs of roasted goat or beef and a flood of beer.
   Kenya Breweries credited a sales increase of more than 10
percent over a year ago and a chronic beer shortage to the
campaigning. Working overtime, the brewery one recent weekend
distributed 12 million bottles of beer, and it wasn't enough.
   Election law sets a campaign budget ceiling of $2,400, but the
law has gone unenforced.
   Rallies are the most popular form of talking to voters, but
candidates sometimes take advantage of any gathering to win support.
   In some districts, local administrators have been forced to ban
weddings, discos and politicking in bars until after polling. In
other areas, candidates and their agents have been barred from
addressing church services, including funerals.
   Officials censor candidates' speeches for exaggerated promises
or insinuations that anyone is anti-government. Troupes of dancers
normally accompany candidates, along with busloads of
placard-carrying supporters.
   But even signs were banned at some rallies this year after
supporters used them to club rivals.

   President Reagan today said Congress caused
the Nicaraguan border crossing into Honduras by cutting off aid to
the Contra rebels.
   In his weekly radio address, the president also said that he
sent U.S. troops to Honduras to show ``the seriousness with which
we view the situation.''
   ``There was a nice celebration of St. Patrick's Day up on
Capitol Hill this week, but believe me, that wasn't the only reason
Congress knew I had my Irish up,'' the president said.
   ``Just as the heroic efforts of the democratic resistance have
forced the communists to cut back on their aggression abroad and to
make peace concessions, the Congress, in a close vote, decided to
cut off aid to the freedom fighters,'' Reagan said.
   ``Since the Congress rejected our package of assistance for
those fighting for freedom in Nicaragua, the communist dictators
have done exactly as we predicted,'' he said. ``Instead of giving
peace a chance, the aid cutoff is giving the communist dictators a
chance.''
   ``Instead of negotiating for a cease-fire, they have launched a
major military assault on the weakened Contras, invading democratic
Honduras in the process.''
   Reagan said the administration's policy has been to ``let the
people of Nicaragua win back their freedom and their independence
from the Soviet Union on their own _ to do this without having to
commit American military personnel.''
   ``But now, because of Congress' aid cutoff last month, the
Sandinistas have mounted their major cross-border incursion into
Honduras,'' he said.
   The president said he ordered U.S. troops to Honduras on
Wednesday at the request of Hondurasn President Jose Azcona ``to
conduct an emergency readiness exercise.''
   ``Our purpose is to send a signal to the governments and peoples
of Central America about the seriousness with which we view the
situation,'' he said.
   Meanwhile an administration source said the United States is
likely to approve a Honduran request for help in ferrying Honduran
troops to the scene of their battle with the Sandinista forces.
   Other U.S. officials said the administration's response to the
request will probably come this weekend.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
government of Honduras asked for U.S. help Friday in transporting
an undisclosed number of troops to an area within about 20 miles of
the Nicaraguan border.
   ``The cable came in to the State Department today, but no
decision has been made as yet,'' said an official who asked not to
be identified.
   But another official said: ``I can't imagine that we would turn
it down. We've done it before.''
   The sources said they would be following similar rules to those
used in December l986, when 40 U.S. helicopters took 700 Honduran
troops and equipment to the Nicaraguan border.
   Rules called for U.S. personnel and equipment to stay well away
from the scene of fighting to ensure they were not exposed to
hostile fire, and no Americans became involved in combat.
   All 3,200 of the U.S. troops ordered to Honduras on Wednesday by
President Reagan had been airlifted into Palmerola Air Base near
Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, by Friday.
   The request for the helicopters came the same day White House
chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. said the administration would
``most carefully'' consider any request by Honduran President Jose
Azcona for use of U.S. troops in combat.
   Baker was asked in a television interview how Reagan would
respond if Azcona asked him to commit U.S. troops to battle to
repel Nicaraguan forces.
   ``No such request has been received,'' Baker said. ``I do not
believe such a request will be received. But were it received, to
answer your hypothetical question ... it would be most carefully
considered and most deliberately considered.''
   Baker was interviewed on the syndicated television program,
``John McLaughlin's One on One,'' taped for broadcast over the
weekend.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, a leading Republican
critic of administration military policies, introduced legislation
barring the president from sending the troops into action without
congressional approval.
   Sending the troops in the first place, Hatfield said, was just
``matching stupidity with stupidity.''
   At the same time a bipartisan group of 11 senators proposed a
$48 million package of new aid to rebels fighting Nicaragua's
Marxist-led government. The package would include renewed authority
for the Central Intelligence Agency to deliver previously
stockpiled weapons.
   Sponsors of the aid proposal said they hoped it would revive
negotiations in Congress and with the administration on an aid
package that could be quickly enacted to replace supplies lost or
expended during the past week's heavy fighting along the
Nicaraguan-Honduran border.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., called the proposal ``a
common-sense, moderate and reasoned approach'' and said it would
strengthen the rebels as they enter direct cease-fire talks with
the Managua regime scheduled for Monday.
   The proposal would use $48 million in unspent Pentagon money to
buy food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies, and transport it
to troops in the field over the next year. About $3 million of that
amount would go for communications gear.
   It would allow the CIA to airdrop ammunition and weapons
previously stockpiled by the rebels to troops in the field. Sen.
David Boren, D-Okla, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
said the rebels still have $2 million to $5 million worth of
undelivered supplies, about half of them lethal.
   It would give Reagan the right to hold a quick, guaranteed vote
in Congress on any request for further military aid under certain
conditions if the peace talks between the Sandinistas and Contras
break down. The bill also would promise long-term economic aid for
the region once political stability is restored.
   Action on further aid for the rebels has been stalled since
March 3, when the House narrowly rejected a $30 million package of
purely humanitarian aid.
   The senators who proposed the aid package included seven
Republicans and four Democrats. They are Boren; Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas; Bob Graham, D-Fla., Sam Nunn, D-Ga.; Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., Daniel Evans, R-Wash., Kassebaum, John McCain, R-Ariz.;
Phil Gramm, R-Texas; Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska.

   Gov. Evan Mecham's supporters sang an
optimistic ``When Evan Comes Marching Home Again'' outside the
Arizona Capitol while the governor, fighting for his political
life, was drawing mixed reviews as star witness at his impeachment
trial.
   ``I think he hurt himself quite a bit,'' said Democratic Sen.
Jesus ``Chuey'' Higuera after Mecham concluded three days of
testimony by taking back an accusation that his former security
chief stole documents.
   ``I did not have the proof and I do not have the proof now,''
Mecham conceded when pressed by senators for the basis of his
accusations against Department of Public Safety Lt. Beau Johnson.
   ``It looks bad,'' Higuera said of Mecham's performance. ``It
looks bad any time anyone gets up there and doesn't tell the
truth.''
   But the Republican governor's lawyer, Jerris Leonard, had a
different view.
   ``I think he did a very good job. He came out direct and
sincere,'' said Leonard. ``The thrust is you've got a man who
simply wasn't being told what the story was, assuming the story is
true.''
   The allegation of document theft came up Thursday, when Mecham
testified that he had ``had complete confirmation that he (Johnson)
was the one'' who took a report on the DPS from an aide's desk and
turned it over to the DPS. Mecham testified that he had an
``informer'' within DPS.
   Johnson denied taking the report, and the DPS deputy director,
Lt. Col. Gary Phelps, told senators Friday it actually was taken by
Mecham aide Lee Watkins, the former state prison construction chief.
   Mecham, the first U.S. governor to be impeached in six decades,
is charged with obstruction of justice, concealing a $350,000
campaign loan and misusing $80,000 from a state fund by loaning it
to his auto dealership.
   Testimony so far has involved only the first charge. The trial
is expected to turn to the second allegation this week.
   The obstruction charge centers on an alleged death threat within
Mecham's administration and an allegation that Mecham tried to
thwart an investigation of the threat.
   Mecham, 63, gave this account of the crucial events of Nov. 12,
1987: ``Two somewhat excitable people had a verbal exchange and
somewhere along the line there were those who determined they
should make something out of it. It's a total manufactured thing.''
   Many other witnesses' memories were significantly different.
   Peggy Griffith, the Mecham loyalist who first reported the
alleged threat, said Watkins made derogatory comments to her about
Mecham's former close adviser, Donna Carlson, who was about to
testify before a grand jury investigating Mecham's campaign
finances.
   ``He said , `A lot of the governor's friends are angry with her
(Ms. Carlson) and if she doesn't shut her ... mouth, she is going
to take a long boat ride,'' Mrs. Griffith recalled.
   Mrs. Griffith said she became ``extremely alarmed,'' tried to
see the governor, alerted his security force and eventually called
Mecham at home. She knew, she said, that Watkins had a prison
record and a history of violent incidents and she took his words
seriously. He was convicted at the age of 19 of a post office
robbery and was convicted of assault in 1966.
   Johnson testified he clearly told the governor that a potential
felony had been committed: tampering with a grand jury witness.
   Mecham says he heard no such details, didn't take the matter
seriously and accepted the evaluation of an ally, Max Hawkins, that
the incident was ``just a bunch of hot air and it would go away.''
   ``If I'd have had any idea or anybody would have told me ...
that anyone was in danger, I would have been the first one there to
see that was taken care of,'' Mecham said.
   It would take a two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate to
convict Mecham and remove him from office. The senators could then
take another vote and bar him from holding state office again.
   Even if he is acquitted, Mecham faces an April 21 criminal trial
on charges he concealed the $350,000 loan and a May 17 recall
election.

   Soviet dissident Herman Obukhov flew from the

Airport by British students who campaigned on his behalf.
   Students from Lancing College near the southern England seaside
resort of Brighton bombarded Soviet authorities with more than
2,000 letters, telexes and postcards on behalf of the 38-year-old
medical engineer from Leningrad.
   The students, members of Amnesty International, the worldwide
human rights group, also wrote letters of support to Obukhov and
his family.
   Obukhov was sentenced in 1981 to four years hard labor in a
Siberian prison camp, followed by two years of internal exile in
eastern Siberia.
   He was arrested in 1980 while trying to give a Western
journalist the manuscript of his book, ``Extinguished Dawn,'' which
criticized Soviet medical policy, particularly the use of drugs to
subdue political prisoners.
   ``My first emotion is that a sweet dream has come true,'' he
told reporters at Heathrow. ``I have waited for this moment nearly
half my life. When I finished my military service 16 years ago I
knew somehow I must get out.''
   Obukhov was forced to leave his wife Irina behind in the Soviet
Union. The couple were married while he was in prison but according
to Soviet law, the marriage has been annulled because Obukhov gave
up his Soviet citizenship to obtain an exit visa.
   During his exile, Obukhov taught himself English by reading a
novel by Evelyn Waugh, unaware the author once attended Lancing
College.
   Obukhov said he will stay at Lancing College while he decides
his future plans.

   Swedish police detained a British
television crew for three hours and seized film they said might
contain pictures of classified areas at a weapons factory, police
said Saturday.
   The three Britons were detained Friday night after workers saw
them filming outside Sweden's arms manufacturing Bofors' plant at
Karlskoga, 180 miles northwest of here.
   A police spokesman at Karlskoga, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the men worked for Yorkshire Television, an
independent production company. He declined to give their names.
   ``We do not suspect that they were spying. They are well-behaved
fellows ... and they are allowed to leave the country any time.''
   ``But they may have violated a law which forbids filming such
installations as an arms factory,'' he said. ``We will know when we
have developed their film.''
   The Swedish government has been investigating Bofors Ordinance
company because it allegedly exported weapons to countries in
volatile areas, an act forbidden under neutral Sweden's arms export
laws.
   The company, a subsidiary of Nobel Sweden Industries, also has
drawn attention after allegations of extensive bribing in
connection with a major artillery deal with India.

   A West German music student
sought in the shooting deaths of two policemen at Frankfurt Airport
has been arrested in the Netherlands, West German authorities said
Saturday.
   Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for the federal prosecutor's
office in Karlsruhe, said Frank Hoffmann, 24, was arrested in
Amsterdam on Friday.
   Foerster declined to give details and it was not known if
Hoffmann had been brought to West Germany. West German authorities
had offered a $62,500 award for information leading to his capture.
   Hoffmann was sought in connection with the killing of two
policemen during an environmentalist demonstration near Frankfurt
Airport last November. Two other officers were injured.
   The shooting of the two officers prompted authorities to seek
tougher demonstration laws, and the government later adopted
regulations that ban protesters from wearing masks.
   Authorities said the shots at the airport protest came from a
group of masked demonstrators.
   A suspect, Andreas Eichler, was arrested shortly after the
killings with the murder weapon in his possession. He has denied
firing the fatal shots and claimed that Hoffmann gave him the gun
after the shooting.
   Authorities say both men belonged to a leftist group that
frequently took part in demonstrations at the airport by
environmentalists protesting the use of a new runway.

<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of diplomatic incidents and
outbreaks of violence this year that have turned Northern Ireland
into a flashpoint and soured Anglo-Irish relations after two years
of relative harmony.
   Jan. 25: The British government admits attempts were made to
obstruct justice in the case of Northern Ireland policemen involved
in the 1982 killing of six Catholics, five of them unarmed IRA
guerrillas. Nonetheless, the government says, there will be no
prosecutions. Ireland says Britain's attorney general ought to be
fired.
   Jan. 28: A British court rejects an appeal by six Irishmen
serving life sentences for planting bombs that killed 21 people in
1974 in the worst terrorist attack ever in mainland Britain. The
Irish government says the evidence suggests they are innocent.
   Feb. 16: Britain announces its tough Prevention of Terrorism
Act, hitherto renewable annually, will be made permanent. Ireland,
which regards the law as discriminatory toward Irish nationals,
protests.
   Feb. 21: A British soldier shoots and kills an unarmed Irish
Republican Army supporter as he walks through a checkpoint on the
Ireland-Northern Ireland border. The soldier claims it was an
accident and is charged with manslaughter. Ireland, in a calculated
slight to Britain, announces it will conduct its own investigation.
   Feb. 23: The army discloses that the only soldier ever sentenced
to life imprisonment for killing a Catholic civilian in Northern
Ireland has been freed and returned to his regiment, having served
less than three years of his sentence. Catholic leaders protest.
   March 6: A British anti-terrorist unit in Gibraltar kills three
IRA guerrillas who allegedly plotted to bomb a military ceremony in
the British colony. Ireland protests that the three were unarmed
and could have been captured alive.
   March 13: The cortege carrying the three Gibraltar dead from
Dublin to Belfast is stoned and jeered by Protestants along the
road.
   March 16: A Protestant extremist fires shots and lobs grenades
at mourners burying the Gibraltar dead, killing three and wounding
68.
   March 19: Mourners in the cortege of an IRA man killed at the
March 16 funeral drag two British plainclothes soldiers from their
car, beat them unconscious and strip them naked. The two are hauled
away and later found shot dead.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Reagan's radio
address Saturday from the White House:
   My fellow Americans, there was a nice celebration of St.
Patrick's Day up on Capitol Hill this week, but believe me that
wasn't the only reason Congress knew I had my Irish up.
   On two issues vital to our national security, I had some stern
words for some of our lawmakers. The first has to do with the
safety of our hemisphere. Back in the early 1980s, there were those
who argued that the prospects for democracy in Central America were
bleak and we would do little to prevent Marxist dictatorships there.
   But after the administration built a consensus, Congress finally
passed our economic and military aid program, and today the
countries of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are
democratic. Indeed, tomorrow, El Salvador, the nation some in
Congress were gloomiest about, will host congressional and
municipal elections, just one more sign of a successful democratic
reform in that nation and region.
   However, in one Central American nation, Nicaragua, the cause of
freedom is in grave peril. Up until the end of last month, the
United States had been aiding the freedom fighters who have been
trying to restore democracy by resisting the regime of the
Soviet-backed Sandinista communists.
   However, just as the heroic efforts of the democratic resistance
have forced the communists to cut back on their aggression abroad
and to make peace concessions, the Congress in a close vote decided
to cut off aid to the freedom fighters. Since the Congress rejected
our package of assistance for those fighting for freedom in
Nicaragua, the communist dictators have done exactly as we
predicted.
   Instead of giving peace a chance, the aid cutoff is giving the
communist dictators a chance, a chance they long hoped for, a
chance to smash their opponents. They have hardened their
negotiating position. They have fired the mediator, Cardinal Obando
y Bravo. They have sent mobs of thugs against peaceful oppostion
groups. And now, instead of negotiating for a ceasefire, they have
launched a major, military assault on the weakened Contras,
invading democratic Honduras in the process.
   Now, from the beginning, our Central American policy has been
designed to prevent another Cuba, and to let the people of
Nicaragua win back their freedom and their independence from the
Soviet Union on their own; to do this without having to commit
American military personnel.
   But now, because of Congress' aid cut-off last month, the
Sandinistas have mounted their major cross-border incursion into
Honduras. In response and at the request of President Azcona, we
have sent American military units to Honduras to conduct an
emergency readiness exercise. Our purpose is to send the signal to
the governments and peoples of Central America about the
seriousness with which we view the situation.
   The freedom fighters are in desperate need of support. If they
are to remain a viable and effective force, they must have
assistance now. There's not a moment to spare. If urgently needed
help does not reach them soon, we face the prospect of a collapse
of the democratic resistance, the attendant consolidation of a
Marxist-Leninist regime in Nicaragua and an increased threat to
Nicaragua's democratic neigbors. Ultimately, we will face a
national security crises of the first order, and an enormous human
tragedy.
   Now, another vital security matter where the Congress has not
been doing its job has involved our work on a strategic defense
against ballistic missiles. This coming week marks the fifth
anniversary of my call for just such a strategic defense
initiative, or SDI. I'm taking this occasion to note that the
Soviets have been making extensive progress on their own SDI-like
program in the last few years.
   Indeed, the Soviets may be preparing a nationwide defense which
would mean a breakout from the restrictions of the ABM treaty which
prohibits a massive deployment of such a system. However, at the
very moment where the Soviets are so far along in their efforts,
Congress has been cutting back ours. Every year Congress has cut
the SDI budget.
   We are now one to two years behind schedule. And this, despite
the fact that the actual SDI program is progressing faster than we
expected. Our scientists and engineers must have Congress' support
and they must have it soon.
   So I can't think of two more vital national security issues than
these; preventing the establishment of a Soviet beachhead in
Central America, and erecting a defense shield that will reduce the
nuclear threat that has so overshadowed the post-war era. That's
why we cannot permit some in Congress to take dangerous risks with
America's national security.
   Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

<HEAD>American Jewish Congress To Differ with Israeli Leader Shamir</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A resolution before the American Jewish
Congress repeating its call for Israel to withdraw from the
riot-torn West Bank and Gaza Strip sharply underlines its
difference with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   The United States has long endorsed the principle of exchanging
territory captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War in return for
a peace settlement with neighboring Arab states and Palestinians.
   However, Shamir, departing the United States on Saturday after a
six-day visit, has strongly rejected the idea, saying it would
endanger the security of the Jewish state because it would put
Arabs who dream of Israel's destruction in a better position to
carry out their threats.
   ``The position taken by our organization obviously is not in
accord with that taken by Mr. Shamir this past week,'' said Andrea
Binder, a spokeswoman for the American Jewish Congress, which opens
a meeting here Sunday.
   ``We issued a statement in September which called for
territorial compromise and endorsed an international peace
conference. The resolution that will be voted on next week will
reaffirm (the earlier) resolution,'' she said prior to the
gathering.
   Another resolution will specifically endorse the complex peace
plan proposed by Secretary of State George P. Shultz in the face of
Arab rioting in the territories and measures by Israeli security
forces to suppress the uprising.
   A third resolution will ``discuss Arab and specifically
Palestinian intransigence in coming to the negotiating table,'' she
said.
   Shamir's visit is expected to be discussed throughout the
four-day convention, which will be attended by about 400 to 500
delegates.
   The American Jewish Congress, which has 50,000 members, was the
first major American Jewish organization to favor a compromise in
the Israeli-occupied territories, Ms. Binder said. The group's
statement last year underscored divisions among America's Jews
about the issue.
   Last Monday, Shamir preceded his meeting with President Reagan
by saying he was outraged by the United States' suggestions of a
withdrawal from the occupied territories. He said a withdrawal
``inevitably'' would invite new Arab attempts to destroy Israel and
that he was ``astounded'' at the short memories of withdrawal
proponents.
   Four days later, Shamir flatly rejected a U.S. proposal for a
full-scale Mideast conference, saying that such a conference would
give the Soviet Union and its Arab allies too much influence, and
might force Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories.
   His Labor Party counterpart in Israel's coalition government,
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, is agreeable to such a conference,
without which Jordan's King Hussein won't come to the table.
   Reflecting sharp disagreement with Shamir, Reagan said: ``Those
who will say no to the U.S. plan _ and the prime minister has not
used this word _ need not answer to us. They'll need to answer to
themselves and their people as to why they turned down a realistic
plan to achieve negotiations.''

<HEAD>A Surge of Good News for U.S. Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy produced a string of good reports last week _
imports were down, housing construction was up sharply, factories
were working at near-capacity levels.
   The generally upbeat news brightened the outlook of some
economists for a year without recession.
   This week, attention will focus on the final report of the U.S.
gross national product for the fourth quarter of 1987, an
indication of how well the economy rebounded from the October
stock-market crash.
   Here, at a glance, are last week's developments:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TRADE FIGURES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department reported only a slight widening of the
U.S. merchandise trade deficit in January, to $12.44 billion, an
increase of 1.9 percent.
   Exports fell as expected by 10 percent, but economists said a 6
percent dip in imports indicated the trade balance slowly is
improving.
   January's deficit was up from $12.20 billion in December, but
down from a level of $13.21 billion in November and $17.63 billion
in October.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>STOCK MARKET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The better-than-expected January trade figures helped drive the
Dow Jones average up to a close of 2,087.37 on Friday, a gain of
52.39 points for the week. It was the stock market's highest level
since October's crash.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HOUSING STARTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department said housing construction climbed 8.9
percent in February. The increase followed declines of 1.9 percent
in January and 15.8 percent in December and was the largest monthly
gain since a 12.7 percent rise in December 1986.
   The strong report eased worries, since housing is often the
first industry to weaken at the onset of a recession.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FACTORY USE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve reported the nation's factories, mines and
utilities operated at 82.4 percent of capacity in February,
sustaining that rate for the third consecutive month.
   The report supported economists' contentions that the industrial
sector remained strong despite fears the economy could weaken from
cutbacks in production as businesses tried to work off a supply of
unsold goods built up in late 1987.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve said industrial production edged up 0.2
percent in February despite output reductions at auto factories and
coal mines.
   The advance, the fifth consecutive monthly gain, followed a 0.3
percent increase in January and left American industry operating at
a rate 5.8 percent above a year ago. Economists said the gain
further dampened concerns about a severe slowdown.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>AUTO SALES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Major automakers said sales of domestic cars and light trucks
rose 6.3 percent in the first 10 days of March compared with a year
earlier, led by surging sales of Ford and Chrysler vehicles.
Industry leader General Motors reported weaker results.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSINESS INVENTORIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department reported a 0.4 percent rise in January
business inventories, less than half the December increase,
reflecting a rebound in car sales that reduced backlogs of unsold
vehicles.
   Analysts said the slower growth suggested the economy may not
weaken in the first half of this year as feared.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>1987 TRADE DEFICIT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department said the deficit in the broadest measure
of foreign trade surged to a record $160.7 billion in 1987, a
reflection of America's deepening debt to the rest of the world.
   The deficit in the U.S. current account was 13.7 percent higher
than the 1986 figure of $141.4 billion and marked the fifth
consecutive year this deficit set a new record.
   The current account measures the flow of merchandise and the
flow of services, primarily investment earnings.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. diplomat held two meetings with
Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega to discuss the
possibility of Noriega giving up power and leaving the country, an
administration official said today.
   The official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said
the meetings were held Friday and ended inconclusively. He said he
knew of no additional meetings being scheduled.
   The official also said that he understood the Roman Catholic
Church, through a papal representative, was getting involved in
negotiations concerning Noriega's future. He did not give any
details.
   CBS Radio quoted unidentified officials today as saying the
meetings with Noriega went badly, with the Panamanian leader
insisting that he wants to remain in the country after stepping
down. The report said the mid-level state department officials who
met with Noreiga were returning to Washington and officials do not
believe Noriega's departure is imminent.
   Another administration official said on Friday that the United
States has decided not to seek Noriega's extradition if he flees
Panama to a third country.
   That official, who also asked not to be identified, said that
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State William Walker had gone to
Panama at Noriega's request to discuss the matter.
   The official also said that two Panamanian pilots who worked for
Noriega have defected to the United States. According to the
official, the pilots said Noriega has been receiving arms from Cuba
and money from Libya since the crisis broke out in that country
three weeks ago.
   Walker had instructions to bring Noriega the no-extradition
offer in hopes that it would facilitate his departure, thus sparing
the country a period of prolonged political upheaval and widespread
suffering.
   The government of Spain has said it would be willing to admit
Noriega provided he requests political asylum and the United States
agrees not to seek his extradition.
   On Feb. 5, two federal grand juries in Florida indicted Noriega
on charges of drug smuggling and money laundering. A U.S. treaty
with Panama precludes the extradition of any Panamanian citizen to
the United States.
   The political opposition in Panama has sought to get rid of the
country's de facto leader for months.
   The United States has been trying to encourage Noriega's ouster
and stepped up the pressure against him after he deposed President
Eric Arturo Delvalle on Feb. 25. Delvalle had tried to fire
Noriega. The United States still recognizes Delvalle, although
Solis Palma was installed Feb. 26.
   The two pilots arrived in the United States on Thursday and were
given permission to remain in this country by the U.S. Immigration
Service, the official said.
   The pilots have told officials that Cuba has provided Noriega
with up to 16 tons of military equipment since the crisis in that
country erupted, the official said.
   Cuba has emerged as a strong supporter of Noriega, considering
him to be a victim of American interventionist activities.
   According to the official, the pilots also said that Libya has
provided Noriega with an undisclosed amount of money to enable the
defense chief to help Panama overcome its current cash crisis.
   Panama has been virtually paralyzed economically for most of the
past two weeks. U.S. actions this month _ including blocking the
transfer of currency to Panama and withholding Panama Canal fees _
effectively have cut off the flow of dollars to Panama and have
left the country unable to meet much of its government payroll.
   The official suggested that Cuban willingness to send weaponry
to Noriega, including large numbers of AK-47 rifles, indicated that
the strongman was willing to fight it out rather than go into exile
peacefully.
   But Noriega's invitation to meet with Walker suggested that he
may be rethinking his position, the official said.
   Initially, the Reagan administration had said that it was not
interested in any deal that would spare Noriega the consequences of
the indictments handed down by the federal grand juries in Florida.
   But the administration appears to have backed away from that
position because of its interest in promoting a peaceful resolution
to Panama's crisis and in protecting the Panama Canal and other
U.S. interests in that country.
   ABC News reported Friday night that unidentified U.S. and
Central American sources say Noriega has signed off on most parts
of a package that will allow some face-saving for him, but will get
him out of office and out of Panama.
   ABC reported that as a condition of Noriega's departure, he will
never go to jail and will be allowed to retain most of his wealth.
   The deal, according to ABC, included that Noriega will step down
with full honors; several days or weeks later, he will leave
Panama, going either to Spain or France. In addition, ABC said,
opposition leaders in Panama have agreed not to seek criminal
charges against Noriega there and not to try to get any of his
money held in overseas accounts.

   Nicaragua's Contra rebels are
willing to hold cease-fire talks as scheduled this week with the
Sandinista government, despite threatening earlier to boycott them,
a Contra spokesman said Saturday.
   The U.S.-backed rebels last week accused Sandinista troops of
invading Honduras in pursuit of Contras and said they would boycott
the talks unless the Sandinistas withdrew.
   But Carlos Hurtado, an adviser to the six-member directorate of
the Contra umbrella organization, Nicaraguan Resistance, said his
side was ready for Monday's talks.
   In Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, President Daniel Ortega said
Friday his government was also ``ready and willing'' to hold the
talks.
   For the first time, the talks are scheduled to take place inside
Nicaraguan territory, in the southern town of Sapoa near the Costa
Rican border.
   The cease-fire talks, which are part of a peace plan the five
Central American presidents signed last night, were almost called
off by both the Contras and the Sandinistas because of the fighting
that flared up along the Nicaragua-Honduras border during the past
two weeks.
   Claiming that Sandinista troops had entered Honduran territory
while chasing Contra troops, the Reagan administration last week
sent 3,200 American troops to Honduras as both a warning to the
Sandinistas and a show of support for Honduras.
   ``But after several days of talks with Costa Rican President
Oscar Arias and former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez,
the Nicaraguan Resistance decided to go to the meeting,'' Hurtado
said in an interview. He did not elaborate.
   ``Even though the fighting continues, mostly in northern
Nicaragua and our fighters have been scattered towards the Atlantic
coast of the country without suffering great damage, we have
decided to attend the meeting,'' Hurtado said.
   ``We want to show we are willing to seek a peaceful solution to
the problem afflicting our country,'' he added.
   The regional peace plan, devised by Arias, calls for
negotiations to end the war in Nicaragua and leftist guerrilla wars
in El Salvador and Guatemala.
   Arias was awarded the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for the plan which
also calls for cease-fires, an end to outside intervention in
Central America, removal of all foreign military from the area,
negotiations for national reconciliations between governments and
opposition and reforms to bring greater democracy to the region.
   Defense Minister Gen. Humberto Ortega, the Nicaraguan
president's brother, will head the Sandinista delegation _ the
Contras have been insisting the Sandinistas be represented ``at the
highest level.''
   The rebel delegation will be represented by all six members of
the Nicaraguan Resistance directorate.

<TEXT>
   Police on Saturday broke up a small
gathering of activists discussing the state of the country's health
care system, a spokesman for the banned Solidarity trade union
federation said.
   Police knocked at the door of a private apartment in Warsaw,
asked the 10 activists to show their identification papers and then
ordered everyone to leave, said union spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz.
   Zofia Kuratowska, a physician and Solidarity activist who was
one of those attending, denied the meeting was an organized one and
contended that it did not require permission from authorities.
   She said it was an informal gathering of friends working in
medicine to talk about problems in the health care system.
   She said many health care workers around the country are
rejecting recently offered wage increases, saying they are
inadequate compared to government price increases expected to raise
the overall cost of living in 1988 by about 45 percent.
   Hundreds of health care workers in Gdansk demonstrated Feb. 24
outside the city's main hospital against low salaries and poor
working conditions.
   At that time, Solidarity's national health service workers'
committee said it had collected more than 4,000 signatures
nationwide demanding reforms in the health care system.
   The committee also warned that nurses and technical staff are
abandoning hospital work because of low pay, and that young doctors
try to emigrate because they feel that they have a poor future in
Poland.

<HEAD>Saudi Confirms It Is Buying Chinese Missiles, But Says No Nukes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia confirmed Saturday that
is is buying Chinese intermediate-range missiles, but it said they
would not be armed with nuclear warheads.
   An official statement, attributed to an unidentified government
official and distributed by the state-run Saudi Press Agency,
strongly defended the kingdom's growing military arsenal as a
factor that ``would contribute to regional stability.''
   The official said Saudi Arabia has acquired ``an
intermediate-range surface-to-surface missile system from China''
but gave no details about the cost or how many missiles are
involved.
   He stressed, however, that media reports that said the missiles
had nuclear capability did ``not conform to the truth and the
kingdom denies (them) fully.''
   The Chinese deal was disclosed in Washington on Friday by the
State Department and was said to involve CSS-2 missiles, similar to
those used in China's limited space program in the early 1970s.
They are capable of being fitted with nuclear warheads.
   The State Department said the missiles had a range of 2,200
miles and could hit any area of the Middle East, including Israel.
   It said the U.S. government was assured that nuclear warheads
would not be fitted on the missiles, but noted that the sale marked
a ``disturbing regional trend.''
   State Department spokesman Rudolph Boone said, ``Such a system
is not in the interests of peace and stability in the region.''
   With Iran and Iraq engaged in a ``war of the cities,'' lobbing
missiles into each other's major population centers, the
introduction of more missiles in the region has raised concern in
Washington, U.S. officials said.
   Boone noted: ``The sum total of the proliferation is a
degradation of the security of all states in the region.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz expressed concern about the
sales when he met Chinese Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian last week,
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said.
   Washington officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Saudi Arabia sought the Chinese missiles after the U.S. Congress
blocked the sale of 48 F-15 jet fighters to maintain Saudi air
strength.
   Oil-rich Saudi Arabia has spent about $20 billion on
sophisticated weaponry, mainly from the United States, over the
last 20 years.
   France and Britain have moved in as prominent arms suppliers in
recent years because U.S. sales were blocked by a pro-Israel lobby
in Congress.
   The missile deal was a suprise development for theocratic Saudi
Arabia which has so far refrained from having political ties with
the two communist powers, China and the Soviet Union.
   Saudi Arabia has commercial ties with them, and has lately
stepped up its political contacts with Beijing and Moscow in its
quest for international efforts to pressure Iran to agree to end
its 7{-year-old war with Iraq.
   Relations between Tehran and Riyadh plummeted last July after
hundreds of Moslem pilgrims, most of them Iranian, were killed in
clashes in the holy city of Mecca.

   Here is the text of the Democratic Party's
response, delivered by Rep. Pat Williams of Montana, to President
Reagan's radio address on Saturday:
   Hello, this is Congressman Pat Williams. I represent Western
Montana in the United States Congress.
   This week, much of the news at home and abroad was discouraging.
The economy remains particularly fragile, the trade deficit is
still dangerously high and, of course, American troops are in
Central America. But, nonetheless, there is particularly good news
to announce from the House of Representatives.
   For the first time in the history of the House Budget Committee,
the federal budget was passed bipartisanly without a single
objection. The agreement, of course, took much work, but the
members of the House Budget Committee completed our blueprint for
federal efforts for the coming year.
   It is a responsible, lean, bipartisan federal budget.
   Most Americans probably missed the news about our budget. That
ought not to be surprising. Controversy routinely creates the
biggest headlines. That's been especially true of the big budget
battles Congress too often has fought in these last several years.
   This time, there was no fight to report. Members of the Budget
Committee have cooperated to approve our new federal budget without
objection.
   As you may remember, the foundation for our budget was laid this
past December at the economic summit between the Congress and the
president.
   Those summit talks, of course, followed last fall's stock market
drop, and they came with the recognition that delay in putting this
nation's fiscal affairs in order could no longer be tolerated.
   Our country began this decade with a national debt of $914
billion. In seven years, that debt exploded to $2.8 trillion _ a
three-fold increase, bigger than any in our 200-year history.
   When this session of the 100th Congress convened in January,
House Speaker Jim Wright fashioned an agenda for our work this
year. Cooperation on the budget between Democrats and Republicans
was the paramount goal of the speaker.
   This budget achieves that goal and complies with the spending
limits set by the economic summit.
   Importantly, this budget _ provided the economy suffers no
serious downturn _ will avoid the automatic, across-the-board
Gramm-Rudman cuts.
   That, by the way, is the way the American people have a right to
expect their Congress to work _ for elected officials to make the
hard choices instead of abandoning them to faceless computers.
   This budget meets a high national responsibility. It fulfills
the right and proper obligation of government to extend a hand to
those citizens among us, those who live in poverty or near to it,
those inflicted by misfortune, those citizens both young and old
who need just a little help to live decent lives and realize the
American promise of a good life.
   This budget provides full protection for those folks and
stitches the numerous holes in our government's so-called ``safety
net.''
   This year, despite his periodic calls in the past for
reductions, the president properly asked Congress for increased
funding for education. We wholeheartedly agree _ so much so that
our budget provides 4 percent more than the White House recommended
for America's schools.
   Our budget does this as well: It adds new revenues to assist
those tragically swelling the ranks of homeless Americans. It
provides funds to fight our nation's war against drugs. It calls
for $1 billion in new appropriations to keep the United States on
the cutting edge of space exploration. We also provide the funds
the president agreed to at the economic summit to keep our national
defense forces strong.
   Every budget must comply with the deficit limits. This year that
deficit target is $136 billion and our budget comes in a full $2
billion below that target.
   This year, the budget is on time. Both House Speaker Wright and
the president, and especially the American people, are correctly
insistent that Congress not fall behind on its budget and
appropriations schedule and not rely on a mammoth year-end spending
bill.
   With this budget, the Congress is not only on time _ we are
ahead of time and we intend to remain on time and move our budget
proposal to the floor of the House next week for debate and passage
and then on to the Senate for its prompt consideration.
   This is Congressman Pat Williams. Thank's for listening.

<TEXT>
   The ruckus over American troops being
sent into neighboring Honduras has bolstered the Sandinista
government at home and abroad, just when it was facing strong
internal opposition.
   Sandinista Defense Committees, the party's neighborhood
watchdogs, have organized meetings and marches against the presence
of the 3,200 U.S. soldiers in Honduras, sent in response to a
reported incursion into Honduran territory by Sandinista troops
pursuing Contra rebels.
   Before the Reagan administration announced the deployment of the
troops, the Sandinistas were undergoing their worst economic,
social and political crisis since coming to power in a 1979
revolutionary war.
   Complaints that had been whispered for years turned into open
confrontations with the government.
   Economic measures announced Feb. 14, which included price
increases, sparked demonstrations. Workers staged wildcat strikes
to demand higher salaries. Family members openly protested against
the military draft.
   Such displays were illegal under a state of emergency enacted in
March 1982. The government revoked the law in January as part of
Nicaragua's compliance with a Central American peace plan calling
for democracy in the region.
   But with the announcement that American troops were going to
Honduras, the opposition's gripes were overshadowed by warnings of
a possible invasion.
   ``We are calling on the Nicaraguan public to be alert, to be in
combat readiness, ready to repel, resist, defeat whatever
aggression from the United States,'' President Daniel Ortega told
the nation.
   On Wednesday, the government ordered all radio stations to hook
into a government-controlled national network, which has been
broadcasting ``alerts'' to the public to prepare for direct
military invasion.
   ``We are ready to repel and annihilate any attempt by the
American infantry. A free fatherland or death,'' network announcers
declared all of last week.
   The Nicaraguan government has denied its army crossed into
Honduras, claiming instead that it began an offensive on March 8 to
roust the Contras from bases along the rugged, jungle border area.
   Ortega claimed the Reagan administration alleged the Nicaraguan
incursion to obtain congressional approval for more Contra aid.
Congress twice rejected renewed Contra assistance earlier this year.
   Two years ago this month _ a week after the Congress voted down
a $100 million aid package for the rebels _ the Reagan
administration said Sandinista troops had entered Honduras. U.S.
pilots ferried Honduran soldiers to the border. Congress approved
the aid package three months later, on June 25, 1986.
   Congress once again began discussing renewed Contra aid on
Friday.
   American troops in Honduras have also brought the Sandinistas
international attention.
   Protests of the U.S. deployment erupted in the United States.
   On Saturday, a U.N. spokesman said a team of U.N. observers
would visit Nicaragua to investigate the Honduran-Nicaraguan border
situation, at Nicaragua's request.
   Honduran war planes buzzed and then dropped bombs Thursday along
the banks of the Coco River that forms the border, and the
Sandinista government blamed the United States for the attack,
filing diplomatic notes of protest to Washington.
   The Nicaraguan government said it will appeal to the
International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, to issue
an injunction against ``any military activity that could raise
tension in Central America.''
   Appearing on a television talk show Saturday morning, Ortega
said Peru has condemned the presence of troops in Honduras. Peru is
a member of the eight-nation Contadora group that has been trying
to negotiate an end to Central American conflicts for the past
seven years without success.
   The Sandinistas have said they are ready to start cease-fire
talks with Contra leaders on Monday in an effort to end the
6-year-old war. The Contras had threatened to boycott the talks
because of the border conflict, but said Saturday that they would
participate.
   The Honduran government has not offered proof that the
Nicaraguan troops are or were in its territory, and Ortega contends
that Honduras was following the whims of Washington when it called
for the U.S. troops.

<HEAD>Darden Death Leaves Several Visible Killers Awaiting Execution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BIRK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The execution of Willie Jasper Darden
has focused attention on the nation's largest death row, where some
well-known killers, including serial killers Theodore Bundy and
Gerald Stano, await their fate.
   Darden's execution left 287 convicted murderers in the death row
wings of the Florida State Prison near Starke.
   Darden avoided execution for 14{ years after being placed on
death row in January 1974, earlier than any of his surviving
inmates except one. While pursuing his appeals, he survived an
unprecedented six death warrants, until his appeals ran out on No.
7 last Tuesday.
   Bundy, linked to more than 20 sex slayings in Washington, Utah,
Colorado and Florida, is under separate death sentences for the
1978 bludgeoning murders of Florida State University sorority
sisters Lisa Levy and Margaret Bowman and for the murder of
12-year-old Kimberly Leach in Lake City.
   Bundy, subject of at least four books and a television
miniseries, has been on death row since August 1979 and has
survived three death warrants.
   Stano, a former short-order cook from Daytona Beach, has
confessed to dozens of killings and is under three death sentences
for the murders of Susan Bickrest and Cathy Muldoon in Volusia
County and Cathy Lee Scharf.
   He also has been sentenced six times to life in prison for other
Florida killings. He has been on death row since January 1984 and
has survived three warrants.
   Capital punishment supporters urge the state to press Bundy's,
Stano's and other cases.
   But while their appeals may seem to linger, some 50 death row
cases are older than Bundy's and some 140 are older than Stano's,
according to Department of Corrections records.
   The governor's office can push the cases forward only as quickly
as legal roadblocks to execution fall. That's up to the courts.
   ``It's counter-productive to sign a warrant if they're not at an
appropriate stage to sign one when you know they have an automatic
appeal,'' said Andrea Hillyer, an attorney for Gov. Bob Martinez
who handles death cases.
   ``You just have to wait until courts are through with different
stages,'' she said. ``It's hard to predict, we just monitor their
cases.''
   On April 7, mass murderer Robert Dale Henderson is scheduled to
to be executed for three of 12 slayings he is believed responsible
for during a spree that started in Ohio and continued through South
Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida.
   However, Henderson's case dates back only six years, and it's
generally expected that his attorneys still have plenty of room for
appeals that would gain a stay of execution.
   Martinez, who has signed 33 death warrants since taking office
Jan. 6, 1987, and seen only two inmates put to death, broke a
record with Darden's final death warrant by allowing Darden's
attorneys only seven days to appeal.
   All the other 17 men executed since Florida returned to the
death penalty in 1979 had three or fewer death warrants.
   Martinez, noting that Darden, condemned for the slaying of a
furniture store owner, had a career criminal record and that he had
14-plus years of appeals, felt no remorse about the hurried
execution schedule.
   ``I think of the whole case, not just the person whose name is
on the death warrant,'' the governor said after Darden's death. ``I
think of the person who died years ago because of the killing. I
think of the family that was left behind.''

   U.S. businesses might have to pay billions of
dollars in new taxes if the U.S. Supreme Court agrees that
Louisiana may tax a New Orleans store for catalogs it had printed
in and mailed from other states, the store's lawyer says.
   The case involves $43,937.03 in use taxes assessed against the
D.H. Holmes Co. department store chain, but lawyers for both sides
agree that the ramifications go far beyond that.
   ``I threw out the figure of $800 million at a meeting of the Tax
Executive Institute in New York. ... People said that was a half or
a quarter of the taxes it would raise,'' William F. Grace Jr., an
attorney for Holmes, said in an interview.
   Use taxes are imposed on property brought in from another state
for use, consumption, distribution or storage. Louisiana, like most
states, sets the use tax equal to its sales tax minus any sales
taxes charged to the purchaser.
   The catalogs in question were designed in New York, printed in
three other states and mailed from those states to customers in
Louisiana with Holmes charge accounts.
   The case to be heard Tuesday by the high court is probably the
most significant in interstate commerce since the L.L. Bean sales
tax case 15 years ago, say both Grace and William Pugh, who is
arguing for Louisiana.
   In the Bean case, the court ruled that mail-order companies
don't have to collect sales taxes from customers in states where
they have no employees or property.
   If the high court upholds state court rulings against Holmes,
Grace said, states could tax such things as flyers sent with credit
card bills, catalogs from national chains with stores in their
states and even telephone directories.
   ``We think it would be a tremendous burden on business and could
be crippling to ... retailers who send tons of their advertising
and catalog materials across state lines,'' said Lee Williams of
the American Retail Federation, which filed one of seven
friend-of-the-court briefs in the case, said in a telephone
interview from Washington.
   ``All of the states are starved for revenues. They're going to
look wherever they can. ... It could turn into big bucks,'' said
Williams, the legislative counsel and a vice president of the
federation.
   ``We contend ... that Holmes did not use these catalogs in
Louisiana. There was no use by Holmes because when the taxes were
imposed, the catalogs were being transmitted in the U.S. mails,''
Grace said. ``At that time, they were not subject to tax.''
   Pugh, a Shreveport attorney retained to represent the Department
of Revenue and Taxation, said the case hinges on ownership.
   ``I would contend and did contend and shall contend that Holmes
owned the catalogs when they were designed, Holmes owned the
catalogs when they were printed, Holmes owned the catalogs when
they were mailed, and Holmes owned the catalogs when they arrived
at the post office boxes,'' he said.
   That argument could mean trouble for catalog companies, said Bob
Levering, legislative counsel for the Direct Marketing Association
in Washington, D.C.
   If the Supreme Court agrees that a company possesses and is
using something while it is being sent through the mail, he said,
it could open the way for taxes on all kinds of mailings, he said.
   Courts in Tennessee, Illinois, New York, Ohio, South Dakota,
Wisconsin and the District of Columbia have reached rulings
opposite to Louisiana's, said Andrew Rinker Jr., another lawyer for
Holmes. But he said Missouri's case was decided the other way.
   One of two legal briefs supporting Louisiana was filed on behalf
of the National Governors Association, National Association of
Counties, Council of State Governments, International City
Management Association, National Conference of State Legislatures,
National League of Cities and U.S. Conference of Mayors. The other
was from the Multistate Tax Commission.
   In addition to the retail federation, the Direct Marketing
Association, the National Association of Catalog Showroom
Merchandisers and the Committee of State Taxation of the Council of
State Chambers of Commerce have filed individual
friend-of-the-court briefs. Magazine Publishers of America Inc.,
Printing Industries of America and R.R. Donnelly & Sons Co., a
catalog publisher, joined forces for another.

<TEXT>
   With banks closed and cash scarce
because of a U.S. financial embargo against the military regime,
Panamanians are resorting to family ties and ingenuity to survive.
Life isn't as easy as it used to be.
   Until recently, Panamanians were used to the good life. The
Panama Canal, a major oil pipeline, and offshore banking propelled
an economy envied by other Central American nations.
   Prosperity ended when the United States applied pressure to oust
the military strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, after a
federal grand jury indicted him on drug trafficking charges and
Noriega supporters ousted Panama's civilian president, Eric Arturo
Delvalle.
   ``We have had it so easy, that we are really suffering now with
this crisis,'' said an Education Ministry employee who identified
himself only as Joaquin. ``We are not a warring type of people. We
are used to the good life.''
   A government worker, who identified herself only as Isabel,
warned of dire consequences if things don't change.
   ``Many families are getting together and sharing everything,''
she said.
   ``My husband works. We can survive. I do not know how other
people who make less can make it. If this keeps up, people will be
on the streets looting, looking for food,'' she said.
   Some Panamanians have adapted with aplomb. Companies have
bartered goods among themselves and supplemented employees' pay
with food coupons redeemable at local stores.
   ``We have better credit than the government,'' said a
businessman who paid his workers each with $20 cash and the rest in
food coupons.
   The cash crisis has hit government workers the hardest.
   First, their paychecks were late when the government, which uses
the U.S. dollar and thus can't just print new bills, lost its
credit.
   When the government finally paid workers, those making up to
$1,000 a month received only $75, including $30 in commemorative
coins issued in 1978 to mark the ratification of the treaties
turning control of the canal over to Panama at the end of the
century.
   To many teachers, the big, round commemorative coins were a
strange sight. ``What is this: some sort of token?'' asked one
teacher, a middle-aged woman.
   The money not only looked strange but fell far short of most
people's needs. ``The landlord is going to have to wait,'' said one
teacher.
   Meanwhile, food is foremost in everyone's mind.
   ``I had nothing to eat yesterday,'' said a mother of two who
identified herself only as Carmen. ``I wish I had known about this
a few months ago, I would not have separated from my husband.''
   She said she was going to stock up on milk for her youngest
child. ``I am going to buy enough for two weeks because you never
know what is going to happen,'' she said. ``I can stand hunger; the
baby cannot.''
   Other families began to ration for their own needs.
   High school teacher Hugo Lloyd said he cannot pay his rent or
utility bills. Lloyd said he and his wife are staying home with
their children because schools are closed.
   ``We ration everything,'' he said. ``You know, we used to say
that we would never see rationing in Panama like you see in other
countries.''
   Technician Arturo Gonzalez was worried about feeding his
household of 11. ``The problem is that kids always want what
they've always had _ candies and stuff,'' he said. ``We had to
eliminate luxuries like fancy deodorants and shaving lotions and
some food spices.''
   Even some opponents of Noriega wondered why Panama's people
should bear the brunt of the crisis.
   ``I do not agree with these military rulers that have a false
civilian government up front,'' said the Education Ministry worker
Joaquin. ``The U.S. even supported this government _ practically
created it. Now it does not want it, and the people of Panama are
paying a high price.''

   Michele and Raymond L'Esperance may be
in the market soon for a good babysitter, or two, or three or four.
   All of couple's five babies, the nation's first test-tube
quintuplets, are home following the release of the last two infants
from a suburban Detroit hospital.
   Veronica and Alexandria L'Esperance, who were placed on
ventilators after they were born Jan. 11, left the hospital Friday
in a limousine with their parents.
   The quints, who were born 10 weeks prematurely by Caesarean
section, are considered healthy, said hospital spokeswoman Valerie
Mahaczek.
   Raymond, Danielle and Erica left the hospital March 7, but the
other two stayed behind until they were able to put on more weight.
   ``I'm awake a lot,'' said Michele, 34. ``Actually it's really
not as bad as I thought, once you get into kind of a routine.''
   ``She's got everything pretty organized,'' said her husband, a
27-year-old corrections officer. ``And it really isn't difficult
for me to come home and pick up a baby and feed one and pick up
another one after that.
   ``It just all seems to have fallen into place pretty well.''
   The couple is getting help from a visiting nurse association,
which sends a nurse to the house to help overnight.
   Babies conceived through in-vitro fertilization are commonly
called test-tube babies because the mother's egg is removed from
her body, fertilized in a laboratory dish and then reimplanted in
her womb.

band is Bobby LaKind, who joined the first band in 1976.
   The album is due out in late summer and will be followed by a
national tour, Hartman said.
   ``We're older, more mature. Our whole outlook is totally
different,'' Hartman said Friday. ``We've seen just about
everything we're going to see as far as the road goes.''
   Hartman said he's not sure how a younger generation will take to
the original Doobies.
   ``The demographics on the last tour were the old folks who grew
up with us. ... There were some kids.
   ``We're not the in same place musically so we're not going to
sound exactly like we did,'' Hartman added. ``We'll hit MTV and the
rest of it.''
   The Doobie Brothers, who aren't related, began playing bars in
northern California in the early 1970s. By the time the band broke
up in 1982, it had recorded 12 albums _ which have sold more than
40 million records _ won four Grammy Awards and featured 14
different members.

   Robert Joffrey, the 57-year-old co-founder and
artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet, has suspended his
day-to-day management of the dance troupe because of an illness,
the dance company said.
   The Joffrey said in a statement Friday the illness has been
diagnosed as myositis, liver disease and asthma.
   The dance company also announced that at Joffrey's request an
advisory group had been formed to assist Joffrey and associate
director Gerald Arpino with current and future operations.
   Members of the advisory group include Sally Brayley Bliss, a
former Joffrey dancer and current company board member; Gage Bush
Englund, former Joffrey dancer and current ballet mistress of the
junior touring troupe, Joffrey II; and Richard Englund, director of
Joffrey II and a board member.
   The company also announced that Penelope Curry, the troupe's
executive director, would continue to be responsible, with Joffrey
and Arpino, for day-to-day management. Arpino will serve as
Joffrey's artistic liaison with the company.
   Richard Englund told The Washington Post that ``Mr. Joffrey's
illness has been ongoing intermittently over a period of close to a
year.
   ``It began with his lifelong problem with asthma, and more
recently has gotten into serious liver complications. He's
presently in a hospital receiving treatment.''
   Joffrey, who was born in Seattle, started the company with
Arpino in 1956.

<HEAD>Leaders Of Caucasus Region Again Call For Union With Armenia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist leaders in a disputed region of the
Caucasus have called again for union with Armenia, repeating an
earlier demand that helped spark bloody riots which left at least
32 people dead.
   The decisions of the party committee in the Nagorno-Karabakh
Autonomous Region, part of Soviet Azerbaijan since 1923, were
reported in the area's newspaper Friday. A copy of the paper was
obtained Saturday.
   The actions showed that despite complaints from national
officials about their handling of the dispute, leaders of the
Delaware-sized region were unshaken in their desire to unite the
territorial enclave inside Azerbaijan with Armenia, a neighboring
Soviet republic.
   Sovietsky Karabakh, the party and government newspaper in
Nagorno-Karabakh, said the region's party committee held a plenary
meeting Thursday in the region's capital, Stepanakert, that focused
on the territorial quarrel.
   The paper said the committee ``expressing the aspirations of the
Armenian population of the autonomous region, the will of the
overwhelming majority of Communists of Nagorno-Karabakh, asks the
Politburo'' to allow it to become part of Armenia.
   It would be highly unusual for a local party committee to go on
record with a demand that had not been previously been cleared by
Moscow.
   Conflict over the region's affiliation led to huge street
protests in the Armenian capital of Yerevan last month and ethnic
rioting in the Azerbaijan city of Sumgait on Feb. 28. At least 32
people were killed in Sumgait.
   On Friday, top Soviet officials, including No. 2 Kremlin leader
Yegor K. Ligachev, met with leading Armenians and Azerbaijanis
living in Moscow to express concern about the turmoil.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed Feb. 26 for ``civic
maturity and restraint'' in Armenia and Azerbaijan and pledged that
the policy-making Central Committee would soon review relations
among the Soviet Union's more than 100 nationalities.
   Armenian nationalist Paruyr Ayrikyan told a news conference
Saturday that his countrymen are divided about whether to proceed
with a plan to demonstrate March 26 to underscore demands that
Nagorno-Karabakh, whose population is more than three-quarters
Armenian, be made part of Armenia.
   Ayrikyan said rumors spread in Armenia that the Central
Committee will meet March 28 for the plenary meeting Gorbachev
promised. ``People are being told, `Don't have the rally on March
26, so as not to hinder the plenum on the 28th,''' Ayrikyan said.
   There has been no official word of when a plenum will be held.
The meetings of the 300-plus member body take place behind closed
doors and are rarely announced in advance.
   In addition to renewing its annexation demand, the regional
plenum also sent Second Secretary V.A. Bogoslovsky into retirement,
and replaced him with B.A. Malkov, who previously worked as an
instructor in the Moscow-based Central Committee's department of
party organization and work, Sovietsky Karabakh reported.
   Western Sovietologists say local party second secretaries are
usually Russians or other Slavs, and that they act as a separate
conduit of information to Moscow.
   Malkov's previous post indicates he is known to top party
officials in the capital.
   The plenum's call echoed one made Feb. 20 by the
Nagorno-Karabakh Soviet, or legislature, which asked central
authorities to shift the territory to Armenian control.
   It was the refusal of the party's national Central Committee to
accede to that demand that sparked protests.
   Since unrest began in the Caucasus, Western reporters have not
been allowed to visit the region to gather information, and have
been unable independently to confirm or deny numerous reports of
ethnic strife and violence.

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Buddy Roemer originally thought
Louisiana's problem was a $150 million budget shortfall, but Monday
he'll give the Legislature his initial ideas on dealing with a $2
billion crisis.
   Roemer is the first to admit that his ambitious plans for
economic development and changes in education, the state's tax
system and environmental protection will have to take a back seat
to the budget crisis.
   ``We are in a position this fiscal year where the numbers drive
the policy and not the policy driving the numbers,'' the governor
said. ``When this state is busted, broke, when the deficit is
approaching a number too large to comprehend, the numbers are
driving this now.''
   The special legislative session convenes Monday for a maximum
10-day run to deal with problems caused largely by the slump in the
oil and gas industry.
   In addition to searching for short-term budget relief, lawmakers
will be asked to split the giant Department of Health and Human
Resources into two agencies and dissolve the Department of Urban
and Community Affairs.
   The governor also has promised proposals to do away with certain
boards and commissions.
   During Roemer's first week in office, there was talk about the
need to ``scrub the budget,'' but the overview expanded into
long-term financing of an estimated $1.3 billion in accumulated
debt and expenses that will be pushed into the next fiscal year.
   Roemer says the state also faces a $750 million shortfall
between anticipated revenues for the 1988-89 budget year and
current expenditures.
   Roemer said that when he first took office, he thought about
$150 million in spending reductions would produce a balanced budget.
   Although Commissioner of Administration Brian Kendrick said he
plans to slash spending to produce a balanced budget proposal,
Roemer said about $300 million in additional taxes may be needed.
   Roemer said taxes would not be considered during the special
session, but Kendrick said the administration will ask for a $90
million increase in fees for certain state services.
   Two ideas are being explored to pay off the $1.3 billion in
accumulated debt and delayed expenditures _ issuance of short-term
notes against projected tax revenues or of long-term bonds that
would be financed through a dedicated source of revenue.
   The first order of business, according to administration
officials, will be to stumble through the rest of the 1987-88
fiscal year through budget cuts and delayed expenditures.
   Already on tap are plans to push one state payday beyond June
30, delay state contributions to retirement systems and vendor
payments and hold up state income tax refund checks.
   The state also will try to take advantage of the depressed real
estate market by renegotiating leases for government office space,
said Kendrick. Some agencies already have been ordered to vacate
leased space and move back into state-owned buildings.
   On Friday, Kendrick met with representatives of major Louisiana
cities to discuss the possibility of withholding such state
payments as revenue sharing and supplemental pay for police and
firefighters.
   ``As we all know, the news is bad. This state is broke. It's
going to take a lot of pain to get us out,'' said Alexandria Mayor
Ned Randolph. ``It's going to take some real curative work.''
   The administration is scheduled to go to court Tuesday to answer
a suit filed by 14 state employees challenging the legality of the
delay of the payday and retirement contributions.
   Roemer said that without the pay plan, there will be layoffs.
   ``If you look at the options, I don't have any, that's it. OK?''
he said. ``And I don't like it. I'm not enthusastic about it. But
that's between $38 million and $45 million we don't have. One
option is to shut this baby (government) down about the 12th of
May. I don't find that very interesting to anybody.''

<HEAD>Red Cross Admits Error in Blood Shipments, Says No AIDS Danger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Red Cross acknowledged Saturday it erred
in distributing 24 pints of blood that had failed AIDS procedures
but said none of the blood was used and none carried the deadly
virus.
   The Food and Drug Administration said Friday that the
questionable one-pint units were shipped last month to hospitals
and laboratories by Red Cross centers in Washington and Nashville,
Tenn., but were never used on any patients. The FDA did not
identify the facilities that received the blood.
   ``While it should not have been shipped, it actually proved to
be HIV (AIDS virus) free, and a number of units underwent
processing that would inactivate the virus,'' said Gene Jeffers,
American Red Cross spokesman.
   He said there was ``no known health hazard associated with the
24 units of blood. We were very fortunate and lucked out in that
there was no human risk at all involved here.''
   Jeffers acknowledged, however, that five of the units tested
positive for hepatitis B antigens and could have posed a health
risk had they been used in transfusions. However, they were not
used, he said.
   Initial tests showed 10 of the questionable units contained HIV
antibodies, which signaled an AIDS danger, but those units
underwent a process that breaks down the blood into components for
specific uses and eliminates the virus, Jeffers said.
   The remaining nine units, he said, were from donors who were
unacceptable because they previously tested ``false positive'' for
AIDS, but all the actual units were tested as safe, he said.
   Federal officials estimate that the chances of getting AIDS, or
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, from a transfusion are one in
40,000. The chief victims have been homosexual men or intravenous
drug users. No one is known to have recovered from the disease that
attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of
resisting other diseases and infections.
   The Nashville Banner reported Saturday that two additional pints
from disqualified donors were actually used in transfusions, but no
patient was harmed. The newspaper gave no details of the
transfusions but said follow-up tests of the blood donors showed
they did not carry the AIDS virus.
   Jeffers said he knew of no actual transfusion of blood that
should have been rejected. The FDA report said none of the
questionable blood was used on patients.
   As a result of the errors, the FDA said it has increased its
periodic audits of the blood supply and instituted new training
procedures for blood bank employees.
   The mistake in Washington was discovered in a routine audit. The
Tennessee errors came to light in an FDA investigation that
followed a lawsuit against local blood bank officials by a woman
who said she became infected with AIDS through a blood transfusion.
   Two senior officials of the Washington regional office of the
American Red Cross _ John McGraw and Frederick Darr _ have been
suspended with pay for 30 days pending an investigation of their
actions, said Richard Schubert, president of the American Red Cross.
   Schubert said no officials in the Nashville center had been
disciplined, but that the investigation there was continuing.
   Six of the questionable units of blood were from the Washington
center and the other 18 were from Nashville, the FDA said.

   President Daniel Ortega said Saturday
he is asking the International Court of Justice for an injunction
preventing military activities that could ``raise tension'' between
Honduras and Nicaragua.
   The move appeared designed to step up political pressure on the
United States, which last week sent 3,200 American troops to
neighboring Honduras as a warning to Nicaragua.
   The tribunal at The Hague, Netherlands, also known as the World
Court, has no power unless both sides of a dispute agree to its
jurisdiction.
   Ortega made his announcement in a talk show appearance on
government television during which he accused neighboring Honduras
of ``being an accomplice in the criminal activities'' of Contra
rebels against his regime.
   While he did not name the United States in his announcement,
Ortega appeared to be referring to the dispatch of American troops
to Honduras. U.S. officials said the move was intended to chasten
the Sandinista government, whose troops allegedly entered Honduran
territory in pursuit of rebels.
   Ortega asked the court to issue an injunction calling for
unspecified ``interim measures of protection'' against any military
activities ``that could raise tension even more between Honduras
and Nicaragua.''
   In Washington, Reagan administration officials said the dispatch
of troops to Honduras was in response to an appeal for help by that
country's President, Jose Azcona Hoyo.
   Azcono claims an estimated 1,000 Sandinista troops are still
inside Honduran territory. But the Sandinistas say they are on
their own side of the border chasing U.S.-supported Contra rebels.
   Ortega said his appeal was part of a lawsuit that Nicaragua
filed several months ago with the world court, demanding that it
condemn Honduras for allowing rebels to use its territory to mount
cross-border attacks.
   Honduras and the Contras claim the rebel camps are on the
Nicaraguan side of the ill-defined, sparsely populated border,
which is dominated by mountains and jungle. The Sandinistas contend
the camps are inside Honduras.
   The civil war has taken more than 40,000 lives since November
1981, when the Contras began fighting the Sandinista government.

   An emergency drive through McDonough County
ended when a police officer named McBride delivered a baby for a
couple named McGrew in Macomb (or should it be McComb?) _ all on
St. Patrick's Day.
   Jason Patrick McGrew was born late Thursday in the driveway of
the Illinois State Police District 14 headquarters.
   Melody McGrew said she and her husband got a late start for the
hospital 20 miles away because she had already had one false alarm.
   ``I guess I wanted to be sure I was ready,'' she said.
   Mrs. McGrew and her husband, Dave, of rural Walnut Grove, were
en route when it became clear the baby's arrival was imminent, and
they stopped at the police station.
   McGrew went in seeking help, and Patrolman Vern McBride, a
former ambulance worker with training in delivering babies, ran out
just in time.
   ``My husband is a farmer and he has delivered many animals, so I
have confidence in him,'' said Mrs. McGrew. ``I think he was a
little nervous, though, when he ran into the police station. That's
the fastest I'd seen him run all day.''

   By the time Reinhold Holtkamp is
finished, he hopes to see purple, pink and white violets decorating
the window sills of most American homes.
   Holtkamp brought his family from West Germany to the United
States some 10 years ago with a mission of spreading the violet
craze to this relatively pioneer territory.
   ``If you walk through the streets in Germany, I don't know of a
window sill that doesn't have a violet on it. It's considered a
necessity there,'' said Reinhold Holtkamp Jr., who helps his father
run Holtkamp Greenhouses.
   ``It's not that way in the States at all. But it wasn't that way
in Germany 20 years ago either,'' said the younger Holtkamp, whose
grandfather is considered the Johnny Appleseed of the violet
industry.
   Holtkamp Greenhouses this year will produce more than 12 million
violets in Nashville, making it the largest grower of violets in
the country.
   Worldwide, its operations in Germany, Japan, Spain and Nashville
will nurture some 65 million of the dainty plants, making the
family business the largest producer of violets on the planet.
   ``If a person is successful at growing violets, they're not
going to stop at growing just one. They become very committed. .. .
Our business is 30 percent above last year,'' Holtkamp said.

<TEXT>
   The Tass news agency indicated that Jordan's prime
minister and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze agreed
Saturday that the U.S. plan for a Middle East peace conference
merits further examination
   The government agency said Jordanian Prime Minister Zaid
Al-Rifai and Shevardnadze discussed the plan and ``noted the
expediency of continuing a substantive talk with the U.S.
administration on issues of a Middle East settlement.''
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz submitted his plan for
negotiations two weeks ago to Israel, Jordan and Syria and asked
for replies by mid-March.
   He proposed that the United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain
and France hold a conference on the Middle East next month to
prepare for negotiations May 1. He also called on Israel to cede
part of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in exchange for Arab
recognition.
   Jordan's King Hussein has refused to enter peace talks with
Israel except at an international conference.
   But Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir rejects such a forum
because he believes it would allow the Soviet Union ``to push a
settlement favorable to themselves and their Syrian clients.''
   Shamir prefers direct negotiations with Jordan and Palestinians
under limited U.S. and Soviet auspices.
   The Tass dispatch said Al-Rifai and Shevardnadze ``pointed out
that the only realistic way leading to a just and all-embracing
settlement of the conflict ... is convocation of an international
conference with the participation of all directly interested
parties, including the PLO.''
   Shultz's plan excludes the Palestine Liberation Organization
from the negotiations. Palestinians approved by the PLO would be in
a delegation with Jordan.
   The Soviet news agency said Shevardnadze and Al-Rifai, in a
Moscow meeting, ``pointed to the danger and inadmissibility of
partial, separate understandings which interfere with settling the
Arab-Israeli conflict and lead to a split between Arab countries.''
It was not clear which understandings Tass referred to.
   Shevardnadze is scheduled to discuss the Middle East peace
efforts with Shultz and other U.S. officials in Washington this
week.

<HEAD>Ruling Gives Northwest Right to Impose Contract on Machinists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has overturned a
judge's ruling ordering Northwest Airlines and its 2,900 mechanics
into mediation and given the airline the right to impose new wages
and work rules in a contract dispute.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 decision Friday,
reversed a December ruling by U.S. District Judge Diana Murphy that
enjoined Northwest from imposing new wages and work rules and and
ordered the parties to federal mediation.
   The appellate ruling is a defeat for the International
Association of Machinists, which represents the mechanics and had
sought to include them in negotiations covering another 7,000
employees who operate under two other contracts.
   Terry Erskine, vice president for law and labor relations for
the Minneapolis-based airline, said Friday night that Northwest
officials have not yet decided whether to impose new work rules in
light of the appeals court ruling.
   It's not clear whether the ruling will have any impact on the
union's ability to support a possible walkout by Northwest's 6,700
flight attendants who have threatened to strike at midnight March
29.
   Talks with the flight attendants also have stalled, and
Northwest has announced plans to impose new contract terms on them
April 1.
   Under the Railway Labor Act, which governs collective bargaining
in the airline and railroad industries, the 2,900 mechanics remain
free to strike.
   In a related development, Erskine said Northwest asked
machinists union International President William Winpisinger to
clarify the union's position on a sympathy strike. Local union
officers implied earlier in the week that they would support a
flight attendant walkout.
   Erskine said a union attorney wrote Northwest on Wednesday and
acknowledged that the machinists cannot call a formal sympathy
strike. That also is the position of Guy Cook, the union's general
president in Minneapolis, the Star Tribune reported Saturday,
quoting unidentified sources who also said that individual union
members are free to honor another union's picket lines.
   Cook, who was out of town, did not return a reporter's phone
call Saturday.
   Friday's court ruling was a setback for the union's efforts to
keep its 10,000 mechanics, baggage handlers and cleaners in one set
of contract talks. Another 10,000 members work under a separate
contract that does not open for negotiations until 1989.
   The legal issue addressed Friday stems from Northwest's efforts
to negotiate transition agreements with the union in the wake of
its 1986 acquisition of Republic Airlines.
   When Northwest announced plans to impose new terms on the 2,900
mechanics in October, the union asked for federal mediation
involving all 10,000 employees whose contracts would be under
negotiation in 1987 and 1988. Murphy said Northwest should not
impose new terms before going to mediation.
   The appeals panel, however, said the National Mediation Board
does not have authority to adjudicate the question and that the
union's request for mediation was improper.
   A machinists spokesman said the union had not yet decided
whether to appeal.

   The official Tass news agency accused the United
States on Saturday of using military threats to impose its will on
Nicaragua and spoil peace efforts in Central America.
   The Tass dispatch, the most extensive Soviet comment on the
dispatch of 3,200 U.S. troops to Honduras last week, did not
mention the Kremlin's support of Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
   ``Washington is actually doing its utmost for preventing a just
peaceful settlement in Central America, for procrastinating and
aggravating the conflict despite its eloquent statements in favor
of the termination of regional conflicts,'' Tass said.
   The dispatch, read on the national television evening news
program and on Soviet radio, was billed as a ``Tass statement,''
one step short of a government statement but still clearly carrying
the Kremlin's endorsement.
   President Reagan sent the troops after Nicaragua allegedly
crossed the border into Honduras in pursuit of Contra rebels.
   The United States has been supplying the Contras with weapons
and other aid for years, but Congress last month ordered an end to
the assistance.
   The Soviet Union and its allies gave Nicaragua $500 million in
economic assistance and $600 million in military aid in 1986,
according to the Pentagon.
   Tass accused the U.S. government of sending the troops to
Honduras to destroy the Central American peace plan signed in
Guatemala last summer.
   The statement listed Washington's harmful actions as
``opposition to the implementation of the Guatemala Accords, the
desire to keep other Latin American countries away from the
political process, and the continuing attempts to legalize the
military assistance to the mercenaries who invaded the Nicaraguan
territory and are using methods of terror against the Nicaraguan
people.''
   It accused the United States of attempting to ``impose its will
on peoples of sovereign countries.''
   The statement made no mention of the Soviet Union's military aid
and other close ties to Nicaragua or say whether the Kremlin would
be willing to end its support of the Sandinista government to help
foster peace. It said only that the Soviet Union ``is ready to
constructively promote'' implementation of the Guatemala Accords.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze was to leave for
Washington on Sunday to discuss the Central American tensions and
other issues with U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz.

   A team of U.N. observers will visit
Nicaragua as soon as possible to investigate the border conflict
with Honduras, a U.N. spokesman said Saturday.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar decided to send the
team at Nicaragua's request. He said it would include one political
officer from U.N. headquarters and an undecided number of military
observers, U.N. spokesman Mahbub Ahmad said.
   Diplomatic sources said the team was likely to include two
military observers and probably would leave on Tuesday. The
observers have not been named.
   The announcement followed a Security Council meeting Friday
night during which Nicaragua, Honduras and the United States traded
allegations over whether Sandinista troops are in Honduran
territory and who is responsible for the current conflict.
   Several Latin American speakers endorsed Nicaragua's call for a
neutral U.N. observer mission to visit the site of the border
clashes.
   Ahmad said there are no immediate plans to visit the Honduran
side of the border. Sources said no request had come from Honduras.
   Nicaragua has requested a joint mission by the U.N. and the
Organization of American States to investigate the border situation
and make recommendations on preventing further conflict.

<HEAD>Teacher's Soviet Fiance Arriving After 21-Year-Courtship</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An American teacher who first met her Soviet
fiance 21 years ago and hasn't seen him in eight years says she's
excited and nervous at the prospect of being reunited with him this
week.
   Victor Novikov, 56, a research chemist in Moscow, is scheduled
to arrive Saturday from the Soviet Union on a three-month
immigration visa, said Elizabeth Condon, 45, a Russian and French
teacher in Woburn public schools.
   The couple have been unable to see each other since Oct. 28,
1979, when they tried to marry in the Soviet Union but were blocked
by Soviet officials.
   Over the intervening years, Ms. Condon's requests for visas to
visit the Soviet Union were turned down repeatedly, as were
Novikov's attempts to come to the United States.
   The couple met in 1967 when Ms. Condon had a temporary job in
Moscow. Over the years, she has visited the Soviet Union 10 times.
   ``The efforts of the Reagan administration in the last two years
in working with the Soviets to resolve cases like ours created a
little bit of hope,'' she said.
   The two finally learned in December that Novikov was among 15
Soviet residents who would be allowed to emigrate after years of
being rebuffed.
   ``We're both very excited, and nervous,'' said Ms. Condon.
``After all, we haven't seen each other for 8{ years. We may need
name tags.''
   She said that if they marry within the three months of his visa,
there will be nothing to keep Novikov from staying in the United
States.
   As for their immediate plans, ``we first have to get
reacquainted and I hope to get Victor into an English class,'' Ms.
Condon said.

   Only 1 percent of $20 million in ``emergency''
U.S. military aid sent to Honduras following a 1986 incursion of
Nicaraguan troops was used to respond to the attack, according to a
secret report by congressional investigators.
   The $200,000 spent to respond to the four-day Sandinista border
raid in late March 1986 was used to airlift Honduran troops to the
remote jungle in southeastern Honduras where the Nicaraguan forces
were attacking Contra rebel camps, and to provide them with field
rations, according to the General Accounting Office.
   The remainder of the $20 million was used simply to speed up a
schedule of routine purchases for the Honduran military, most of
them aimed at modernizing the country's armed forces, the GAO found.
   Some of the items purchased with the money had little to do with
defense of the country's Nicaraguan border. They included two LCM@8
landing craft and related equipment for the Honduran navy, valued
at $1.36 million.
   In contrast to the ``emergency'' status of the Reagan
administration's aid request, the money was spent over a period of
months, and some $3.3 million of the aid remained unspent a full
year after it was authorized, the agency found.
   And rather than drawing all of the aid from existing Pentagon
stocks, as normal emergency procedures dictate, only $6 million in
materiel was taken directly from the Defense Department. The rest
of the money was used to buy items directly from contractors and
other sources, GAO said.
   Honduran officials and some in the State Department later
acknowledged that Honduras had to be pressured to complain about
the incursion, which occurred in a remote and relatively
unpopulated jungle, and to ask for U.S. aid. The Hondurans were
reluctant to admit publicly that the Contras were using their
territory as a staging area for attacks into Nicaragua.
   The issue of how badly Honduras needed the military help two
years ago has been revived after last week's deployment of 3,200
U.S. troops on a training exercise in Honduras in response to a
similar Sandinista border incursion.
   The wisdom of President Reagan's decision to send in American
personnel has been sharply questioned in Congress, with some
lawmakers accusing the administration of exaggerating the
Sandinista threat to generate sympathy for a new package of aid to
the Nicaraguan Contras.
   On Friday, Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams told
reporters that discussions were under way with Honduran President
Jose Azcona about the possibility of providing additional U.S.
assistance to his country.
   ``There are some other possibilities that we've discussed,''
Abrams said. He did not say whether those options included military
financial aid, as in 1986, but did say the administration did not
contemplate sending additional troops. Abrams was instrumental in
arranging the 1986 aid.
   Sources, who spoke on the condition they not be identified by
name, said the government of Honduras asked the United States for
help Friday in transporting troops to an area near the Nicaraguan
border where Honduran and Sandinista forces were fighting. An
administration source said the request was likely to be approved.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., disclosed existence of the GAO report
Thursday at a hearing when he asked John C. Whitehead, the State
Department's No. 2 official, to explain the discrepancy between the
seriousness with which the administration portrayed the 1986
incursion and the minuscule amount of money spent to respond to it.
   The Associated Press later obtained a summary of the findings of
the still-classified report, dated Feb. 2 and prepared at the
request of Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark.
   ``How can we take seriously the administration's rhetoric on
this occasion?'' if Congress and the public were misled in similar
circumstances two years ago, Obey asked, according to a transcript
of the hearing before his Appropriations subcommittee on foreign
operations.
   ``What I find so troubling is the parallelism with two years ago
... If they were concerned in 1986, why did they only spend
$200,000 of the $20 million to deal with the problem they said they
needed it for?'' Obey asked Whitehead.
   ``Because the incursion backed away,'' Whitehead responded.
   ``Why didn't you return the money, then?'' Obey continued.
   ``Fortunately, the money did not have to be spent on repelling
an invasion because the invasion disappeared,'' Whitehead said.
``We hope it will disappear again.''
   Obey said he was not alleging that any of the money was used
illegally, but concluded: ``It appeared that that incursion was
simply used as an excuse to get $20 million in additional military
aid to Honduras.''
   ``I do not know, Mr. Chairman,'' Whitehead said. ``I have no
reason to disagree with the GAO report.''
   The GAO also found that Pentagon reports to Congress describing
delivery of the 1986 assistance ``contained numerous
inconsistencies and inaccuracies.''
   The administration has portrayed the latest border incursion by
Sandinista troops as a large, long-planned and well-executed attack
that jeopardized Contra supply centers inside Honduras and left
rebel casualties, much as the administration did in the 1986 raid.
   Like the incursion of two years ago, this one came at a time
when Congress was locked in controversy over whether to renew aid
to the anti-Sandinista rebels. In both cases, the House had just
voted down an aid package and further congressional action loomed
ahead.
   In both instances, the administration produced a written request
from Honduran President Azcona for U.S. support to repel the
incursion, and in both cases diplomatic consultations involving
military aid had taken place before the written request.
   In 1986, the border battle proved indecisive and turned out to
relatively unimportant in military terms. On Friday, Senate
Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla., said it
appeared Sandinista troops were withdrawing from the area without
having achieved many of their objectives.
   Reagan authorized the $20 million sent in 1986 under the Foreign
Assistance Act, which allows the president to transfer up to $75
million a year in unused Pentagon money for any ``unforeseen
emergency ... which requires immediate military assistance to a
foreign country.''
   The aid was a substantial boost in military help for Honduras,
which received $60 million that fiscal year in regular U.S.
assistance. In fiscal 1988, the regular military aid level was
increased to $80 million.
   ``The administration declared it was an emergency'' Obey said of
the 1986 incursion, noting the written aid request from Azcona,
whom he said ``often appears not to sneeze without asking (U.S.
Ambassador Everett) Briggs for a hanky.''

   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP _ Waves of Iraqi fighter-bombers pounded
Iran's biggest oil terminal Saturday, leaving at least two tankers
ablaze in the northern Persian Gulf. Iran said it shot down three
Iraqi warplanes.
   Both sides fired missiles into each other's capitals and
bombarded population centers with artillery for the seventh
straight day, resulting in civilian casualties.
   An Iraqi military spokesman, announcing that two long-range
missiles were fired into Tehran, declared: ``We will make the
Iranians live in hell until they accept peace.''
   The attack on the Kharg Island oil terminal, through which 90
percent of Iran's oil exports flow, was the first in six weeks and
came during one of the heaviest Iraqi air offensives against Iran
in several months.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said Iraqi
warplanes and helicopter gunships flew 270 combat missions
Saturday, including attacks on Iranian cities.
   Iraq also claimed that its forces killed or wounded 800 Iranians
during an ``abortive attack'' by Iran in the central sector of the
730-mile front line on Friday. Iran claimed Saturday its troops
killed or wounded 400 Iraqis in the sector but denied launching an
offensive there.
   The Iraqi News Agency quoted military communiques as saying ``a
very large number'' of Iraqi warplanes penetrated Iranian air
defenses around Kharg in a major attack on the oil terminal.
   The report, monitored in Nicosia, said the jets bombed a tanker
assembly zone east of the island.
   ``Our planes penetrated the intensive enemy air defenses ...
dropped their bombs on many tankers of various types and size,
destroyed their targets, set them ablaze, and left columns of smoke
billowing over the area,'' a communique said.
   Gulf-based shipping officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, reported that at least two tankers owned by the National
Iranian Tanker Co. were ``burning fiercely'' after the raid.
   They identified the ships as the 316,379-ton Avaj and the
253,837-ton Sanandaj.
   The officials said an Iranian supply boat also was hit and there
were casualties, but they had no other details. Ships in the area
reported pillars of black smoke over Kharg.
   The Iranian news agency reported that Iranian interceptors shot
down an Iraqi jet in a dogfight over the gulf. It said naval
gunners downed two other Iraqi jets, one a Soviet-made MiG-23 jet,
with surface-to-air missiles minutes later. All the pilots were
reported killed.
   Iraq made no mention of any aircraft losses Saturday. But the
communique on the Kharg raid did not contain the usual claim that
all the Iraqi jets returned to their bases.
   The Iraqis have attacked Kharg only three times since November,
apparently because the Iranians have intensified their air defenses
there.
   Iraqis bombed the terminal scores of times between August 1985
and last fall in their campaign to choke off Iran's crucial oil
exports, its economic lifeline.
   The ``war of the cities'' also continued, with Iran firing one
long-range missile into Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, another into
the northern border city of Khanaqin and 12 short-range rockets
into the Iraqi naval base of Umm Qasr in the south.
   Another missile was fired into Al-Amarah, 200 miles southeast of
Baghdad, Iranian communiques reported. The Islamic Republic News
Agency said the missile that hit Baghdad was aimed at a ``military
headquarters'' in the city of 5 million.
   But Iraq said it exploded in a ``purely residential'' area,
killing several civilians. It said it responded by firing two
missiles into Tehran.

<TEXT>
   A University of Chicago researcher is a little
worried about fitting in when she goes to Saudi Arabia to accept
the King Faisal International Prize on Tuesday for her breakthrough
in cancer research.
   ``I don't want to do anything offensive. I want to follow their
dress code,'' said Dr. Janet Davison Rowley, the first woman and
fourth American to receive the prestigious award in that Middle
Eastern nation with strict rules on how women may act and dress in
public.
   But she said she knows there have been many changes in the
Islamic country. And she doesn't plan to pack a veil in her
suitcase.
   ``In the 1960s, girls weren't even going to schools and young
women now are in medical school,'' said the University of Chicago
researcher, who discovered a link between genes and leukemia.
   Mrs. Rowley, 62, is being honored by the King Faisal Foundation
for ``service to humanity.''
   Mrs. Rowley is the only woman among the 45 prizewinners chosen
since 1976, when the foundation was established by the late
monarch's U.S.-educated sons to honor work in a variety of fields,
said spokeswoman Karen Strickholm in Los Angeles.
   She plans to spoil herself a bit with the $47,000 cash prize.
   ``This sounds self-indulgent. I have a nice garden where my
husband and I live and I'm tired of lugging garden hoses around. So
I'm going to buy a sprinkling system,'' she said. ``If there's any
money left over, then I'll think of something else.''
   Mrs. Rowley's scientific breakthrough came in 1972 while she
studied chromosomes from leukemia victims. Chromosomes carry the
genes that convey hereditary characteristics. There are 46
chromosomes in a normal human cell.
   Mrs. Rowley noticed one day that in nearly all leukemia
patients, a piece of chromosome No. 9 had broken off and switched
places with a piece of chromosome No. 22.
   She raced to the library to see if anyone else had observed this
phenomenon.
   ``They hadn't,'' she recalled. ``It was one of the greatest
moments of my life.''
   Mrs. Rowley has received other honors for her work, but her path
wasn't easy. The discovery came after she'd spent 10 years bent
over a microscope in a small corner of laboratory space.
   But if she'd started later, it might never have happened at all.
   ``I'm convinced that there would be less chance of it today,''
Mrs. Rowley said. ``A lot of the money is diverted to defense, and
there's more researchers. I had no research background and had to
find someone to take me in.''
   Dr. Leon O. Jacobson gave her a chance at his University of
Chicago laboratory in 1962 on a part-time basis after she finished
medical school, Mrs. Rowley said.
   ``She certainly convinced me that she was someone I should take
on,'' Jacobson said. ``She's always working, doing, thinking.''
   Now, Mrs. Rowley tries to do her bit for today's young
researchers.
   ``I'd like to be remembered for my scientific contributions,
which I think are important in understanding the link between
chromosomes and disease,'' she said.
   ``But I'd also like to be remembered as an honorable individual
who worked very hard to help young people in the lab and elsewhere
to further their careers.''
   Mrs. Rowley now oversees more than a dozen other University of
Chicago biomedical researchers. Her husband, Donald, is a pathology
professor at the university.

   Downtown strollers were offered half-pound bags
of popcorn for a nickel apiece in a demonstration to increase city
dwellers' understanding of farmers, and show how much influence
they have on consumer prices.
   ``Of course, (some people) were just happy to get a deal on
popcorn,'' said Greg Leaf, a spokesman for agricultural
manufacturing clients who helped with the popcorn sales Friday.
   ``And many people were genuinely interested in our message,''
Leaf said Saturday.
   Friday's popcorn sale was Chicago's contribution to Agriculture
Day, a national observation officially designated for Sunday but
was observed at various times across the country.
   While the 5-cent unpopped corn was intended to signify the
farmer's share of the eventual retail cost of popcorn, 50 cents a
pound in Chicago supermarkets, the annual Agriculture Day has a
broader message.
   ``You're entwined with agriculture even if you live in a
high-rise in Chicago and never see a field,'' said Leaf. ``And
issues that affect the farmer are your issues, too.''
   Not only through food are we all linked to the farmer, he said,
``but through fibers for clothing. And a lot of people have jobs
related to agriculture.
   ``So if you're a truck driver and you haul food, you're affected
by agriculture whether you know it or not.''
   Leaf said the couple dozen popcorn vendors sold out their 3,000
bags of unpopped corn to an estimated 2,000 people.
   Nearly everyone acknowledges a need for the products of
agriculture ``if he stops and thinks,'' said Leaf.
   ``So this is a reminder, one time a year, to stop and think.''
   Agriculture Day is sponsored nationally by the Agriculture
Council of America, and locally by various farm-related
organizations.

<TEXT>
   Swallows were outnumbered by
tourists and there was no telling how many of the birds had just
arrived, but bells pealed anyway Saturday to herald the tiny birds'
return to Mission San Juan Capistrano.
   An estimated 7,000 people flocked to the 212-year-old mission,
some waiting out an early-morning chill, to witness the swallows'
fabled St. Joseph's Day return from their winter home in Argentina.
   Although only a handful of the cliff swallows were seen by
midmorning, 92-year-old Paul Arbiso, who has announced the sighting
of the swallows' return since 1910, rang four old bells to welcome
them back at 9:34 a.m.
   He had been expected to ring the bells an hour earlier, but
instead went to Mass. However, with the mission grounds packed,
tradition apparently had to be fulfilled.
   ``I saw a couple (of swallows) this morning, not too many, a
few,'' he said. ``I was in the other church and they wanted me to
ring them so they brought me here.''
   The crowds and urban sprawl are responsible for the scarcity of
swallows, who once numbered in the thousands, Arbiso suggested.
   ``The swallows used to come before when nobody was around. But
now there are too many people and too many buildings,'' he said.
   Amador Perez, 66, of East Los Angeles, who said he and his wife
have come every year since 1947, agreed there were more swallows
than last year but nothing like the numbers he saw the first time.
   ``In 1947, first you would see six to eight and then you'd see a
whole flock, hundreds of them,'' Perez said, adding that he
nonetheless still enjoys the day's festivities, which include
mariachi music and picnics.
   The insect-eating birds, who travel more than 6,000 miles from
Argentina to the mission, are a victim of urbanization that has
turned the small farming town about 60 miles south of Los Angeles
into a community of 22,500 with condominiums and parking lots.
   About 40 early birds _ which the mission staff refers to as
scouts _ had been counted around the grounds during the week.
   First accounts of the swallows were recorded nearly from 1776,
the year Father Junipero Serra founded the mission. Composer Leon
Rene's 1939 pop tune, ``When the Swallows Come Back to
Capistrano,'' popularized the return of the tiny cleft-tailed birds
and ignited the tourist rush.
   As legend has it, the swallows have failed the camera- and
binocular-toters only once, in 1935, when they were reportedly
delayed by a storm.
   The event has its detractors. Some bird experts argue that
migrating animals don't make or keep appointments.
   ``March 19 is a day people chose and I'm not sure the swallows
are aware of it,'' said Gerald Collier, a San Diego State
University ornithologist. ``They do come around the beginning of
spring.''

<HEAD>A Day Late and $4.02 Short on Taxes, Business Closed By City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WYOMING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roger Wilson was a day late and $4.02
short so the town tax collector and two armed police officers shut
down his cash register sales company.
   A day later, he was back in business, but out $27 for changing
the locks back. Wilson called the whole thing ``ridiculous,'' and
Mayor Charles Huizenga called it ``unfortunate.''
   Wilson's short-lived tax protest began last month. He mailed his
$160 in winter business taxes on the due date, Sunday, Feb. 14,
figuring the Postal Service would get it to city offices on the
next business day.
   He figured wrong.
   The federal government this year observed Feb. 15 as the
Presidents' Day holiday, and that meant no mail delivery. But the
city of Wyoming didn't observe the holiday, so the 15th was a
normal working day.
   That meant that Wilson's taxes didn't arrive by the deadline,
and that meant a penalty.
   ``We sent a letter requesting a $3.02 late-fee penalty payable
in February,'' said Treasurer Anne Porritt. ``We contacted him
again in March and it ended up being a total penalty of $4.02,''
she said. ``He just refused to pay it.''
   Wilson said he didn't pay the penalty because he didn't feel it
was justified. The city didn't buy that.
   On Thursday, city tax collector John Kramer showed up at
Wilson's business for the $4.02.
   ``I told him he was being ridiculous and to get out of my
office,'' Wilson said. ``He kept saying, `I'm just doing my job.' I
said, `I know, and that doesn't require you to think, does it?'
That probably didn't win me any points.
   ``He was back in a little while with two police officers. They
actually forced us to leave and lock up the office,'' said Wilson.
   Wilson gave up his fight Friday and paid the $4.02. He also paid
$27 to get his company's locks changed back.
   In addition, he paid $248.85 for his estimated 1988 property
taxes after Porritt invoked an ordinance saying advance collections
may be made on businesses when there is a reason to doubt that they
will pay what's due.
   ``All this for $4.02. The city of Wyoming must have a lot of
money to spend or they must be very short of it,'' he said. ``The
cost of doing this had to be phenomenal.''
   Porritt had no cost estimate.
   ``I realize it appears ridiculous to do it at $4.02, but do I
just forget it? That isn't fair to the others who paid,'' she said.

   The Soviet and U.S. governments should thaw out
the Cold War because their citizens are weary of the arms race, a
Soviet official and an American peace activist said Saturday.
   But Edward J. Derwinski, undersecretary of the U.S. State
Department, countered, ``There's nothing wrong with a `cold' war _
it means the absence of a hot war.''
   Derwinski, the Rev. William Sloane Coffin Jr. and Oleg Benyukh,
minister of public information for the Soviet Embassy in
Washington, D.C., were among officials, professors and peace
activists on hand to address a conference at Governors State
University in suburban University Park.
   Arms control ``has direct impact on every local community, so
each community should be part of this discussion,'' said Coffin,
president of SANE@FREEZE, one of the sponsors of the daylong event.
   ``I think Americans, as well as the Soviet people, are sick and
tired of the Cold War,'' Benyukh said in a telephone interview.
   Benyukh said the conference and similar meetings across the
United States and in his country are ``steps in the right
direction'' toward achieving peace.
   ``The mistrust we have today comes from not knowing each
other,'' Benyukh said. ``The more we talk the better we understand
each other,'' he said.
   ``And when we live in peace with each other, isn't it a waste to
spend so much money on armament?'' the Soviet official said.
   Citizens should assert their views about the direction the U.S.
government should take on arms control, because experts have lost
perspective on the subject, Coffin said in a telephone interview.
   ``I hope we do kick the cold war habit. It is politically and
economically disastrous,'' said Coffin, a former chaplain at Yale
University.
   But Derwinski said arms control is too complex an issue for
citizens to grapple with and will remain in the hands of the
experts.
   Saturday's conference was sponsored by the Chicago Sun-Times;
Star Publications, a suburban newspaper; a suburban chapter of
SANE@FREEZE, a non-profit, non-partisan community peace group; and
the university.

   Israeli soldiers raided a Ramallah hospital
Saturday in search of Arab protesters and the government banned a
PLO youth group in the occupied territories, where violent
Palestinian demonstrations subsided.
   Also in Ramallah Israeli troops briefly detained four foreign
television crews.
   Stone-throwing youths confronted Israeli troops in scattered
clashes in the occupied territories, but no shootings were
reported. Hospital officials in the Gaza Strip said nine
Palestinians were admitted with beating injuries.
   A statement Saturday by the Defense Ministry said authorities
had outlawed Shabiba, the youth group of Yasser Arafat's Fatah wing
of the Palestine Liberation Organization with thousands of members
throughout the territories.
   ``Given its continuous involvement in the disruption of Israel's
law and order in the area, and since it is an inseparable part of
the PLO, it was declared illegal ... Members will be subject to
arrest and trial,'' the statement said.
   An army spokesman said troops moved into the Ramallah hospital
in the early morning ``to remove undesirable elements from the
premises and return control of the hospital to the doctors and
nurses.''
   The hospital, near the center of the West Bank city 10 miles
north of Jerusalem, has become a gathering place for young Arab
protesters. They have raised the outlawed Palestinian flag on its
roof, hurled stones at soldiers, and taken refuge in the hospital's
corridors.
   The army spokesman said troops removed ``those individuals who
disturbed the functioning of the hospital'' and retreated after
several hours, maintaining a guard at the entrance.
   However, the Arab-owned Palestine Press Service said soldiers
burst into the hospital, checking identification papers and
assaulting staff members. The agency said troops stationed at the
entrance also prevented relatives from visiting patients.
   The agency said doctors and nurses at the hospital carried out a
sit-in strike against the army action later Saturday.
   The foreign television crews detained in Ramallah included teams
from America's CBS and Cable News Network who the military said
defied an order to leave the area.
   Army commanders are empowered to close off areas under their
control at will.
   Eli Fastman, a cameraman for the London-based Visnews, said the
four two-man crews entered Ramallah after they were presented with
a closure order. They stayed there ``to challenge this crazy system
of closing us out of the territories,'' Fastman said.
   Fastman said the crews, which also included a team from the
London-based Worldwide Television News, were taken to a military
police station in Ramallah where they ``discussed the situation
with army officials.'' The army filed no charges and released the
crews an hour later, he said.
   The Palestine Press Service said a free-lance reporter working
for the New York daily newspaper Newsday, Nancie Katz, was also
briefly detained by troops near the city of Nablus for violating a
closure order.
   The army also arrested an Arab journalist in the West Bank town
of Tulkarm. The journalist, Adnan Damiri, works for the Palestine
Press Service, the agency and Israel radio said.
   Damiri was arrested during the night in connection with security
offenses, the agency said. He has already served 6{ years in prison
for security offenses.
   An army spokesman said he had no information on the arrest.
Israel radio said it was one of several during the night in Tulkarm.
   Also in Tulkarm, the army distributed leaflets calling on Arab
residents to refrain from protests, Israel radio said. The radio
quoted the leaflets, also distributed in the town of Qalqilya, as
telling inhabitants they would only hurt themselves by engaging in
disturbances.
   In the Gaza Strip, a curfew remained in force on the Shati
refugee camp and a section of Gaza City after sustained protests
there.
   Widespread disturbances began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza,
where 1.5 million Palestinians live. Israeli captured the
territories in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The United Nations reports that 102 Palestinians have died in
the latest unrest.

   A resolution before the American Jewish
Congress repeating its call for Israel to withdraw from the
riot-torn West Bank and Gaza Strip sharply underlines its
difference with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   The United States has long endorsed the principle of exchanging
territory captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War in return for
a peace settlement with neighboring Arab states and Palestinians.
   But Shamir, who is visiting the United States through Monday,
has strongly rejected the idea, saying it would endanger the
security of the Jewish state because it would put Arabs who dream
of Israel's destruction in a better position to carry out their
threats.
   ``The position taken by our organization obviously is not in
accord with that taken by Mr. Shamir this past week,'' said Andrea
Binder, a spokeswoman for the American Jewish Congress, which opens
a meeting here Sunday.
   ``We issued a statement in September which called for
territorial compromise and endorsed an international peace
conference. The resolution that will be voted on next week will
reaffirm (the earlier) resolution,'' she said prior to the
gathering.
   Another resolution will specifically endorse the complex peace
plan proposed by Secretary of State George P. Shultz in the face of
Arab rioting in the territories and measures by Israeli security
forces to suppress the uprising.
   A third resolution will ``discuss Arab and specifically
Palestinian intransigence in coming to the negotiating table,'' she
said.
   Shamir's visit is expected to be discussed throughout the
four-day convention, which will be attended by about 400 to 500
delegates.
   The American Jewish Congress, which has 50,000 members, was the
first major American Jewish organization to favor a compromise in
the Israeli-occupied territories, Ms. Binder said. The group's
statement last year underscored divisions among America's Jews
about the issue.
   Last Monday, Shamir preceded his meeting with President Reagan
by saying he was outraged by the United States' suggestions of a
withdrawal from the occupied territories. He said a withdrawal
``inevitably'' would invite new Arab attempts to destroy Israel and
that he was ``astounded'' at the short memories of withdrawal
proponents.
   Four days later, Shamir flatly rejected a U.S. proposal for a
full-scale Mideast conference, saying that such a conference would
give the Soviet Union and its Arab allies too much influence, and
might force Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories.
   His Labor Party counterpart in Israel's coalition government,
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, is agreeable to such a conference,
without which Jordan's King Hussein won't come to the table.
   Reflecting sharp disagreement with Shamir, Reagan said: ``Those
who will say no to the U.S. plan _ and the prime minister has not
used this word _ need not answer to us. They'll need to answer to
themselves and their people as to why they turned down a realistic
plan to achieve negotiations.''

   Here is a summary of the developments Saturday involving
Nicaragua, Honduras and the United States:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HONDURAS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Honduras ordered several more battalions of soldiers to
reinforce its 2,000 troops along the border with Nicaragua. The
troops are trying to oust Nicaraguan soldiers who entered Honduran
territory. President Jose Azcona Hoyo said he wouldn't hesitate to
seek more U.S. help.
   But a few hours after Azcona spoke, the Honduran armed forces
announced the Nicaraguans were withdrawing. Honduran officials said
the Sandinista troops had crossed the border last week in pursuit
of U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>UNITED STATES:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan called for renewed aid for the rebels, known as
Contras. His administration sent 3,200 American soldiers to
Honduras last week. The Defense Department said the U.S. troops
probably will be in Central America for about 10 days.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NICARAGUA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega said he is asking the International
Court of Justice in The Hague for an injunction preventing military
activities that could ``raise tension'' between Honduras and
Nicaragua. The tribunal, also known as the World Court, has no
power unless both sides of a dispute agree to its jurisdiction.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONTRAS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Nicaragua's rebels said they are willing to hold cease-fire
talks as scheduled this week with the Sandinista government,
despite threatening earlier to boycott them unless Nicaraguan
troops withdrew from Honduras. A Contra spokesman, Carlos Hurtado,
said the rebels were ready for Monday's talks in the southern town
of Sapoa near the Costa Rican border.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOVIETS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The official Tass news agency accused the United States of using
military threats to impose its will on Nicaragua and spoil peace
efforts in Central America.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A team of U.N. observers will visit Nicaragua as soon as
possible to investigate the border conflict with Honduras.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar decided to send the team
at Nicaragua's request. The group will include one political
officer from U.N. headquarters and an undecided number of military
observers, U.N. spokesman Mahbub Ahmad said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MEXICO:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Mexico said the crisis in Panama and at the Honduras-Nicaragua
border calls for ``great prudence and the need to use political
means to achieve a negotiated peace.'' Foreign Minister Bernardo
Sepulveda said Mexico opposes outside military intervention in the
region.

   The Reagan administration will complain to
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze this week about his
country's military aid to Nicaragua, but won't let the issue
disturb preparations for a superpower summit, officials said.
   Shevardnadze, due to arrive Sunday afternoon, will hold three
days of talks starting Monday with Secretary of State George P.
Shultz. Lunch at the White House with President Reagan is
tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
   The aim is to clear the way _ especially on arms control _ for a
Reagan trip to Moscow in May or June to sign another U.S.-Soviet
disarmament agreement.
   The Soviet foreign minister will come at a time of preoccupation
in the capital with events in Honduras, where 3,200 U.S. troops
were sent after Nicaragua moved against guerrillas using
sanctuaries on Honduran territory.
   The Soviet Union supplies the Nicaraguan forces.
   In 1986, Moscow and its allies gave Nicaragua $500 million in
economic assistance and $600 million in military aid, including
helicopter gun ships, transport aircraft and more than 1,200
vehicles for probable military use, according to the Pentagon's
most recent report on Soviet military power.
   That aid, compared with what the United States sends to the
resistance and to U.S. client states in the region, ``makes us look
like paupers,'' State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said
Friday.
   He called the Soviet effort ``massive'' and said the issue would
be raised during the talks with Shevardnadze.
   Shevardnadze may carry complaints of his own.
   The official Soviet news agency accused the U.S. government
Saturday of sending troops to Honduras to destroy a Central
American peace plan signed in Guatemala last summer. Tass said the
administration's support for the guerrillas in Nicaragua aids
terrorism.
   Redman sought to dispel the view that the issue would dominate
the talks, saying ``the Soviets know how we feel.''
   Another State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said arms control, the situation in Afghanistan and
human rights in the Soviet Union were equally important topcs for
the talks.
   Shultz is expected to press Shevardnadze to clarify Soviet plans
for the withdrawal of its estimated 115,000 troops from Afghanistan.
   A Soviet spokesman said last week that even if United
Nations-sponsored negotiations in Geneva fail to produce a
political settlement in Afghanistan the Soviet Union would withdraw
its troops anyway.
   This appeared to be a change in Soviet emphasis, away from the
need for a Geneva accord and toward a unilateral pullout.
   ``The Soviets didn't need the Geneva accords to invade
Afghanistan so they certainly don't need the Geneva accords to
leave Afghanistan,'' Redman said. Nevertheless, he added, ``We do
believe it would be preferable if there were an agreed-to, orderly
basis for that withdrawal. We think that's something that would be
in the interest of all parties, including the Soviets.''
   The chief U.S. desire is an end not just to Soviet presence but
to Moscow's financial and military support to the Afghan government
_ which the State Department has labelled a mere ``faction'' among
political groups in the country.
   If the Soviets continue helping the Afghan government after a
troop pullout, the United States will continue its support to
resistance forces fighting the Kabul regime for almost a decade,
the State Department said.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze's last meeting, in Moscow in February,
was dominated by discussion of arms control, notably efforts to
reach an agreement on up to 50 percent cuts in long-range nuclear
missiles and bombers carrying atomic weapons.
   Negotiators have been trying to devise a pact in time for
signing at a summit.
   One of the most difficult-to-achieve ingredients of the arms
pact is a verification system that insures the destruction of the
weapons and satisfies both sides that armaments outlawed by the
pact are not subsequently deployed.
   Since February, each side has completed its drafts of how the
verification system should work and the negotiators are now trying
to narrow the differences in the documents.
   On Tuesday, Shevardnadze is scheduled to join Shultz in a
ribbon-cutting ceremony opening the U.S. end of
Washington-to-Moscow communication links known as ``risk reduction
centers.''
   The computer and telefax filled center, on the 7th floor of the
State Department, and a comparable communications post in Moscow,
will be used to help the two sides keep in touch at a minute's
notice if problems arise with treaties to limit weapons, incidents
at sea and the danger of accidental war.
   Center managers tested the high-speed communications link last
week by exchanging maps of the Moscow and Washington subway systems
by high-speed data transmitters.

   Tobacco companies can be held accountable for not
having warned consumers about the hazards of smoking before a law
was passed requiring warning labels on cigarette packages, a
federal judge ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Walter Jay Skinner dismissed claims by
Joanne Kotler that her husband died of lung cancer because three
tobacco companies failed to warn about the hazards of cigarette
smoking after the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act went into
effect on Jan. 1, 1966.
   But Skinner ruled that she will be allowed to continue her case
on the basis of inadequate warnings before the federal law was
enacted.
   ``There is no language in the act that even hints at retroactive
application (of protection provided by the package warning), and it
surely is not necessary to give the act retroactive application in
order to give it full force of effect,'' Skinner wrote.
   Skinner's opinion, issued last Wednesday, resulted from a
hearing held in October 1987, two months after a similar case was
dismissed by a federal appeals court ruling that the warning labels
on cigarette packages protect tobacco companies from liability
suits.
   American Tobacco Co. had argued that the Kotler suit, filed in
March 1986 against it and two other tobacco companies, Philip
Morris Inc. and Liggett Group Inc., should also be dismissed. But
Skinner disagreed, saying the court did not distinguish in the
previous case between smoking done before the warning labels were
begun and smoking done after.
   Mrs. Kotler, of Cambridge, alleged in her suit that her husband,
George, started smoking at age 11 because of aggressive and
negligent advertising campaigns by the tobacco companies. He
continued smoking for 44 years until his death in January 1986.
   The suit also alleged that the companies failed to warn of the
dangers of their cigarettes and that they failed to adequately
test, design and market them. The defendants have denied the claims.
   Skinner permitted the continuation of Mrs. Kotler's allegations
that the cigarettes were defectively designed and breached the
implied warranty of their sale.
   The defendants argued that the law states, ``Good tobacco is not
unreasonably dangerous merely because the effects of smoking may be
harmful,'' Skinner wrote.
   But Skinner said a ``product may be negligently designed even
though it functions as intended if design changes would have
reduced the danger of the product without significant reduction in
its efficiency and without undue cost.''
   ``Other courts have held that cigarettes may be found to be
`bad' if the tobacco contains pesticide residues, which might have
resulted from inadequate testing, or if they contain excess
nicotine or additives, which may affect their safety,'' Skinner
wrote.
   Eric Nissen, Mrs. Kotler's attorney, did not immediately return
a message left on his office telephone answering maching Saturday.
Spokesmen for Connecticut-based American Tobacco; New York-based
Philip Morris; and Durham, N.C-based Ligget did not return phone
calls to their offices Saturday.

   A judge has dismissed attempted
manslaughter charges against a prostitute who continued soliciting
sex after she contracted the AIDS virus, a case believed to be the
first of its kind in the nation.
   Circuit Judge Michael Cycmanick ruled Friday that prosecutors
failed to prove that Elizabeth Kay Sherouse, 24, actually intended
to kill any of her customers.
   ``Thank you, Jesus,'' Ms. Sherouse said after the judge's
decision.
   Although the judge said she might have been negligent in
continuing to solicit sex, he said there was no evidence indicating
she had an intent to kill.
   Prosecutors claimed that Ms. Sherouse, who has been convicted
nine times on prostitution-related charges, tried to kill two men
last summer by agreeing to have sex with them after she had been
told she carried the deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome
virus. Neither man has tested positive for the virus.
   Assistant State Attorney Rick Bogle said the state will decide
next week whether to appeal the ruling. Ms. Sherouse is scheduled
for trial May 2 on six unrelated misdemeanor charges and a
racketeering charge.
   Her attorney, Bill Sheaffer, argued that Ms. Sherouse, a cocaine
addict with a seventh-grade education, was too ignorant about AIDS
to understand the danger she posed to the men.
   Bogle disagreed.
   ``She didn't care what happened,'' Bogle said. ``She didn't care
she could kill somebody.''

   South Dakota Democrats, honoring results of
the Feb. 23 presidential primary, allocated national convention
delegates Saturday on that basis during a statewide caucus in
Pierre.
   Although national party rules do not permit the election to have
any directly binding effect on the national convention delegates,
state Democrats said it was only proper to do so.
   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt will receive nine pledged
delegates and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis will receive six
delegates, state Democrats decided.
   Gephardt initially was allocated six delegates Saturday and
Dukakis was given four. Five more pledged delegates will be
parceled-out between the two candidates in proportion to primary
results on April 23 when the Democratic State Central Committee
meets in Mitchell.
   In addition, four top members of the South Dakota Democratic
Party automatically receive seats as delegates to the national
convention in July.
   Gephardt received 44 percent of the vote to win the state's
Democratic primary. Dukakis came in second with 31 percent.
   The decision to pattern the delegate selection process after the
results of the state presidential primary was made with no debate
and no dissent.
   ``I move that we reflect the integrity of the South Dakota
voters and reaffirm the express presidential preferences of the
primary election vote,'' said Ted Muenster of Sioux Falls, state
chairman of the Gephardt campaign.
   The motion was immediately seconded and the question called for,
which in parliamentary proceedings prevents any further debate.
   There had been rumors that some Democrats might attempt to
discard the election results and instead base the allocation of
delegates on the preferences of those attending the caucus.
   After the caucus, Rick Hauffe, the newly named executive
director of the state Democratic Party, confirmed the rumors but
said he was pleased that no opposition surfaced.
   ``This is a good demonstration of Democratic unity in South
Dakota,'' Hauffe said. ``It's going to go uphill from here.''
   Kip Scott of Sioux Falls, state campaign manager for Dukakis,
said he was disappointed that Dukakis finished second in the state
primary.
   ``Michael Dukakis wasn't exactly a household name in South
Dakota before the election,'' Scott said. ``I felt some of the
lessons we learned enabled us to go into the South and do well
there.''
   Dukakis gained the most Democratic convention delegates on Super
Tuesday and leads in total pledged delegates.

<DATELINE>PALMEROLA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. soldiers deployed on what
Washington officials call a show of military support for Honduras
and a training mission said Saturday they are ready for anything.
   ``We're prepared to do anything they ask us to do,'' Maj. Mike
Nason of the 82nd Airborne Division headquartered at Fort Bragg,
N.C., said at the Palmerola air force base. ``I don't want to
speculate, but the 82nd Airborne is a combat unit. Anything can
happen.''
   Nason arrived in the first plane Thursday of an airlift of 3,200
American soliers sent by the Reagan administration to Honduras.
They were dispatched after Nicaraguan soldiers entered Honduran
territory in pursuit of U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras.
   U.S. officials say the troops will not engage in combat. They
say the troops are in Honduras for a training mission combined with
a show of force and support for the Central American nation.
   But Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government has accused the
United States of preparing to invade Nicaragua. President Daniel
Ortega said last week his forces are ready to ``liquidate'' the
U.S. troops.
   Nason, from Garden City, N.Y., said the American soldiers would
be surprised if they are called upon to do anything other than
demonstrate American support for Honduras.
   ``Our orders remain that we're here to train. We're not here to
enter into combat,'' he said.
   The arrival of the 82nd Airborne and units of the 7th Light
Infantry from Fort Ord, Calif., put U.S. strength in Honduras at
about 6,900, according to Maj. Gary Hovatter, the public affairs
officer for American troops in Honduras. The troops who had been
here before the reinforcements were sent are assigned to various
U.S. facilities and engaged in training exercises.
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras asked for the additional
U.S. troops in hopes of forcing a Nicaraguan retreat and he said
Saturday he won't hesitate to ask for more U.S. assistance.
   Azcona has asked for a U.S. helicopter airlift to help him
deploy Honduran troops in the mountainous Bocay border region where
the Sandinistas crossed the frontier.
   Despite the tense situation, the American soldiers at the
Palmerola headquarters were relaxed Saturday. Many said they looked
forward to the training activities and nothing more.
   ``I like it. It's fun,'' said Pfc. Shane Lawson of Columbus,
Ohio. ``You can't train like this in the States, so we came down
here. And we get to train with Honduran troops.''
   Sgt. Kenneth Martin Anderson said he was upset at protests back
home over the deployment.
   ``They're protesting just to protest something,'' he said. `They
don't understand that you can't have communists running free all
over the place doing what they want to do. What happens if the
United States gets attacked by communists?''
   Anderson and Lawson were in a contingent of about 670 airborne
soldiers in camouflage battle dress who climbed into Blackhawk and
Chinook helicopters for the brief flight to their bivouack at the
nearby base of Tamara.
   Hovatter said the U.S. troops were sent to four Honduran bases:
Tamara, just north of the capital; San Lorenzo in the south;
Juticalpa, about 65 miles northeast of the area where the Nicarguan
incursion took place, and Palmerola, 40 miles west of Tegucigalpa.
   Nason denied Nicaraguan claims that the U.S. operation was
designed to bring in equipment for the Contras in their 6-year-old
war against the leftist Sandinistas.
   ``Wherever we go, the equipment goes. None of it will stay
here,'' he said.
   Nason said the 82nd flew in two tanks, four Cobra combat
helicopters, three light helicopters, more than 100 machine guns, a
dozen 105mm howitzers and several thousand rifles.
   On the main highway through Tegucigalpa, people stopped to look
at a convoy of about 25 trucks filled with U.S. soldiers.
   Reporters driving alongside the caravan asked the troopers where
they were heading.
   ``Nowhere!'' one soldier shouted.

   Claude Montana's winter ready-to-wear collection of
long trousers and Christian Lacroix's display Saturday of short
skirts showed that the two lengths can live in harmony.
   Montana's show featured long pants along with some skirts, tops
cinched at the waist and often with huge funnel collars.
   The designer has abandoned his big shoulders in favor of the
raised or large sloped collars and shoulder wraps.
   He has honed down the sharp silhouette to simplicity in great
fabrics and colors _ lots of caramels and a few pastels or black in
silk gabardines, ribbed jerseys, leather and shorn mink.
   For evening, he concentrated on ways to make the black suit
different. His black suits had satin scroll details over collars,
lapels and jacket hems, and some elegant swirled stitch patterns,
updating the tuxedo or smoking suit.
   Christian Lacroix's collection featured short coats with rounded
shapes in hot-colored mohair with fichu wrapped collars.
   From lean suit shapes to the familiar bell-shaped short skirts
or some bloomer-dresses for evening, Lacroix surprised viewers with
new velvets printed like Persian rugs or prints with small leaf
motifs.
   Givenchy also showed acres of luxury clothes, mainly shorter
lengths for daytime, just skimming the knee or slightly above.
   His man-tailored suits and waist-fitted suits with slightly full
skirts displayed elegance. In shades of raspberry or bright blues
or green, the tweeds are outstanding, as are some of the leather
cardigan jackets.
   The knit outfits were in bright colors or tan and beige,
sometimes with a wide-wrapped top.
   Guy Paulin was another designer who went in for simplicity. His
models displayed short suits with clinging stretch black skirts
topped by bordeaux and olive long piped jackets.
   Cable-knit or jersey trouser suits were best with boleros in
shades of khaki and caramel, or in pastel boucle knits.
   Long iridescent taffeta raincoats with elasticized waists over
full skirts or fitted coat-dresses in vermilion or emerald added a
lively touch to the sober gathering of winter clothes.

<HEAD>Saudi Arabia Says Missiles Would Be Used for Defensive Purposes
Only</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Saudi Arabian government said Saturday the
intermediate-range missiles it had acquired from the Chinese would
be used for defensive purposes to protect its territory and Islam's
holiest shrines.
   The Saudi information office, in a statement to the official
Saudi Press Agency, quoted an unidentified official as saying that
any nation has a legitimate right to defend itself by any means it
deems necessary but that Saudi Arabia would not arm the missiles
with nuclear warheads.
   The official said newspaper reports about the ``nuclear capacity
of these missiles does not lend itself to truth and is utterly
negated by the kingdom, as the steadfast and well-known policy of
the kingdom is based on the permanent efforts to make the Middle
East region avoid the dangers of the nuclear arms race and to
remain free from all its forms.''
   The State Department confirmed Friday that Saudi Arabia had
acquired Chinese missiles with a range of 2,200 miles, capable of
hitting all areas of the Middle East, including Israel.
   The missiles were described as Chinese CSS-2 rockets, similar to
those used in China's limited space program in the early 1970s and
capable of being outfitted with nuclear warheads.
   ``It is not a new or strange tendency that Saudi Arabia seeks to
secure its requirements of weapons for its armed forces from
different sources, in accordance with its defense needs and in
conformity with the prevalent circumstances in the region,'' the
statement said.
   ``This principle is based on its defense policy aimed at
bolstoring its capabilities, for the sake of the legitimate defense
of its territory and Holy Shrines, particularly in view of the
unstable situation and existing conflicts in the Middle East
region,'' the statement said.
   The official said Saudi Arabia is responsible for protecting the
holy shrines of Mecca, the birthplace of Prophet Mohammed, and
Medina, site of Mohammed's tomb, which are located in a western
region known as Hijaz.
   On the other hand, the official said the kingdom's defense
policy ``has never demonstrated any aggressive tendency. Its policy
was, and still is, based on keenness to avail security and prevail
peace throughout the region.''
   Therefore, the official said, any program ``aimed at fostering
its defense capabilities and protecting its legitimate interests is
not a menace to peace. On the contrary, the more its defense
capabilities are reinforced, the more it helps in propagating peace
in the region.
   ``On the basis of this principle, Saudi Arabia acquired this
Chinese-made medium-range surface-to-surface missile system,'' the
official said.

<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union on
Saturday completed the first round of negotiations by the two
countries on a new long-term grain agreement.
   Deputy Trade Representative Alan F. Holmer, U.S. team leader in
the negotiations, called the seven-hour discussion ``frank and
amicable with both sides presenting their respective point of
view.''
   ``No deadline has been set for completion of the agreement,''
Holmer said in a statement. ``However, both countries would like to
come to mutual terms over the next several months.''
   The current five-year agreement, which expires Sept. 30, calls
on Moscow to buy at least 9 million tons of grain annually and
specifies that the purchase include a minimum of 4 million tons
each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the
remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton
of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1
million tons of grain equivalent.

<HEAD>Winter Goes Out With A Bang, Not A Whimper, in North-Central U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The last full day of winter made itself felt with a blast of
cold arctic air across the north-central United States on Saturday,
plunging afternoon temperatures into the teens in northern
Minnesota and Upper Michigan.
   Spring begins at 4:39 a.m. EST Sunday.
   Daytime temperatures remained below freezing from the northeast
half of North Dakota through much of the Great Lakes to New
England. Strong northerly winds ushering the cold air into the
north-central United States were expected to produce squalls and
heavy snow in parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania on Saturday night.
   Heavy snow warnings were issued for northeastern Ohio and
northwestern Pennsylvania, where 6 to 10 inches of snow was
expected.
   It was also unseasonably cool in parts of Texas, where morning
temperatures dipped into the 20s and 30s. Several cities set
low-temperature records for the date, including El Paso with 22
degrees; Del Rio, 29; Corpus Christi, 30; and Brownsville, 38.
   The upper Midwest and Northeast had scattered snow showers,
while the Carolinas and the mid-Atlantic Coast region had sporadic
light rain. Sunny skies prevailed across the south-central and
southwestern United States.
   A high wind warning was issued for southeastern Wyoming on
Saturday. Gusts of up to 52 mph were clocked at Cheyenne.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 16
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 87 in San Diego, Calif. The
early-morning low for the nation was 3 degrees below zero at
Gunnison, Colo.
   Sunday's forecast called for scattered snow from the Great Lakes
and upper Ohio Valley to New England, with rain in the Pacific
Northwest, especially in western Washington state and northwestern
Oregon. Fair to partly sunny skies should prevail across the rest
of the nation.
   Afternoon highs should remain below 40 degrees from eastern
North Dakota through the Great Lakes region and Ohio Valley to New
Jersey and New England, with highs in the 20s and upper teens from
Minnesota across the Great Lakes to northern New England. Highs
should reach into the 70s from the southern Plains through southern
Arizona to California, climbing into the 80s in western Texas and
the desert Southwest. Highs in the 40s, 50s and 60s were forecast
for most of the rest of the nation.

   Separating Honduras and Nicaragua
where Sandinista troops entered Honduran territory to attack bases
of U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels is the the Coco River, a wide,
shallow stream.
   But the Coco is a confusing border, winding through a maze of
thick jungle and mountains, merging with enough tributaries to make
one uncertain of the side of the frontier he's on.
   The thrust of the Nicaraguan offensive has been in the area
around San Andres de Bocay, a border town 170 miles northeast of
Managua where the Bocay River flows from Nicaragua's Jinotega
province into the Coco.
   North of the Coco at that point is a series of small Honduran
mountain ranges and a broad plateau. Flat and parched during the
current dry season, it resembles parts of the American southwest.
   There are narrow valleys that provide relatively secure
locations for the bases of the rebels, known as Contras.
   South of the Coco, in Nicaragua, the swift-running Bocay tumbles
down a long series of rapids through the mountains of Jinotega
province and cuts through a deep valley named after it in its fall
to the low-lying Coco.
   Where the two join at the border, they look much alike, both now
in the six-month dry season that began in November and in the rainy
season when they carry enormous amounts of water.
   The Bocay Valley, extending from the Honduran border far into
Jinotega, has long been a strategic supply route for the Contras.
   Over the years, the jungled hills that rise hundreds of feet on
both sides have been laced with an narrow trails, first made by
local farmers and more recently by the Contras.
   From the Honduran border, the Contras send supplies down the
valley into Nicaragua in dugout canoes and other boats or on the
backs of mules and men who walk the jungle trails.
   On the Honduran side of the Coco where it is met by the Bocay a
small airstrip extends perilously along a bluff overlooking the
water. Supplies are landed or parachuted there by light planes that
bring them from other Contra bases inside Honduras.
   The area is just 43 miles northwest of Bonanza, a Nicaraguan
mining district. But Bonanza is too isolated and difficult to
defend for the Sandinistas to station troops there permanently.
   Instead, the Sandinistas have driven the Contras out of the
Bocay Valley several times as they did this month and have attacked
their bases inside Honduras.

   A woman who claims she inspired Michael
Jackson's 1983 hit ``Billie Jean'' was sentenced to 303 days in
jail for violating a probation order to stay away from the pop
singer's home.
   Lavon A. Muhammad, 40, who was twice previously convicted of
trespassing on Jackson's estate and who is described as suffering
from delusions, was found guilty Friday of violating the terms of
probation for the 1986 convictions, which required her to remain a
mile away.
   Municipal Court Judge Michael J. Farrell, however, dismissed
several misdemeanor charges against Ms. Muhammad, including
trespassing and violating a court order.
   She was arrested at 3 a.m. Feb. 12 in Jackson's back yard after
scaling a 5-foot wall.
   Both prosecutors and her defense attorney say she suffers from
delusions and believes she is engaged to marry Jackson. She also
claims the superstar is the father of her 6-year-old twins.
   Jackson, 29, denies any involvement with Ms. Muhammad.
   In 1986, he obtained a four-year restraining order to keep the
woman away, said Deputy City Attorney David S. Kestenbaum.
   Kestenbaum said that Ms. Muhammad, despite her claims, was not
the inspiration for the song ``Billie Jean,'' which includes such
lyrics as, ``Billie Jean is not my lover'' and ``The kid is not my
son.''

<HEAD>White Supremacist Group Gets Resolution on AT&T Ballot
^Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to add date of annual meeting.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white supremacist group has forced
AT&T into asking shareholders to vote on ending the telephone
company's minority hiring program on the grounds that blacks are
intellectually inferior.
   The racist National Alliance offered the resolution on the
ballot for AT&T's annual shareholders' meeting in Denver, set for
April 20. The Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that it must
appear, with minor changes in wording, despite the company's
objections.
   AT&T's management has recommended that shareholders vote against
the proposal.
   ``AT&T has had a long-term commitment to the advancement of
women and minorities,'' said AT&T spokesman Herb Linnen in
Washington. ``It's ludicrous in this day and age to have it
suggested that women and minorities not be given their rightful
place based on their achievements in the workplace.''
   He said AT&T, the nation's largest long-distance telephone
company, has an ``outstanding record to point to (on affirmative
action), one which we're proud of and we intend to continue our
firm commitment in this area.''
   The National Alliance is a Washington, D.C.-based organization
that promotes the study of Adolf Hitler's writings.
   Its leader, William Pierce, also heads the white supremacist
Cosmotheist Church, with headquarters in Pocahontas County, W.Va.
He is the author of ``The Turner Diaries,'' a fictional account of
an all-out race war ending in the domination of a worldwide
Hitler-inspired regime.
   The National Alliance bought 100 shares of AT&T in 1986, and
Pierce told the Charleston Daily Mail that the group's members have
been working on the AT&T campaign for a year and a half.
   In a statement sent to shareholders, the National Alliance
claimed that ``only 1.1 percent'' of blacks possess an IQ of 114 or
above _ a ``desirable'' figure for most AT&T employees.
   ``We believe that to ignore data such as this in employment
practices sacrifices the essential long-term benefits of personnel
quality, for the short-term approval of pressure groups,'' the
statement said.
   The resolution says minority hiring has had ``negative effects''
on morale among white AT&T employees who could ``feel discouraged
and ignored when they notice that the company is actively seeking
to advance non-whites.''
   AT&T has disputed the group's allegations that its minority
hiring program has hurt morale.
   Ironically, AT&T management also has recommended a vote against
another proposal from a New Jersey shareholder who believes there
aren't enough women and minorities in executive positions.
   That proposal asks AT&T to reformulate affirmative-action
programs ``to ensure that racial minorities and women are not
under-utilized in upper-middle and executive levels of corporate
leadership.''

   Left-wing guerrillas attacked a
state-owned coal mine, stole dynamite, blew up equipment and took
two hostages with them as they fled, police reported Saturday.
   They said an estimated 100 guerrillas of the pro-Cuban Tupac
Amaru Revolutionary Movement were involved in the pre-dawn raid
Friday on the Cachi mine 30 miles west of this provincial capital.
   Police and army units are searching for the rebel band and the
two miners taken captive in the mountainous area about 130 miles
east of Lima.
   Authorities reported no one was injured in the attack. No
estimate of damage at the mine was given.
   The Tupac Amaru front emerged in 1984 as an urban guerrilla
group but in the past year it has extended its attacks to include a
few rural zones.
   It is considered less violent than Peru's largest guerrilla
organization, the Maoist Shining Path movement that has been active
for eight years. Government officials say more than 10,000 people
have been killed in violence related to the Shining Path.

   Steve Martin's screenwriting for
the movie ``Roxanne'' and John Patrick Shanley's work on the
``Moonstruck'' script won top honors at the annual Writers Guild of
America Awards.
   CBS was the big television winner during the 40th annual awards
presentation late Friday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, taking top
honors in seven categories, including best TV spot news script.
   NBC and ABC each took four awards while the Public Broadcasting
Service had three and Home Box Office won one. Three of NBC's
awards came via a three-way tie in one category, best comedy
episode.
   The awards were presented on the 11th day of the 9,000-member
guild's strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers, and references to the strike flavored the
evening, despite guild Executive Director Brian Walton's
admonition, ``This is a night to celebrate writers and writing.''
   Martin was honored for best screenplay based on material from
another medium.
   The comedian, who also starred in ``Roxanne'' with Daryl Hannah,
wrote the script for the summer comedy hit which was adapted from
Edmund Rostand's ``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' a story about a man with
an unattractive nose who uses well-chosen words to woo his lady.
   Shanley was honored for best original screenwriting on
``Moonstruck,'' which is nominated for six Academy Awards and stars
Cher as a Brooklyn Italian widow who finds herself engaged to one
man but in love with his brother.

   A Michigan schoolteacher and a retiree
together raised $14,000 to help cover the medical expenses of a
toddler who's the longest survivor of a five-organ transplant.
   Moses Rutland, 71, a retired butcher, and John Ribner, 49, an
eighth-grade teacher, both of Flint, Mich., said contributors
ranged from the city's mayor to a child who gave $34 in pennies.
   The money was donated Saturday for Tabatha Foster, 3, of
Madisonville, Ky., who is recuperating from a five-organ transplant
she underwent Nov. 1 at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   She received a new liver, pancreas, small intestine and parts of
a stomach and colon during the experimental operation, which is not
covered by her parents' insurance. She suffered from short gut
syndrome, a congenital defect, and she would have died without the
transplant, according to doctors.
   Rutland said he began collecting money for Tabatha last November.
   ``It seemed like somebody in the world should try to help this
family,'' he said.
   Ribner later organized a two-week, $1,400 drive at Whittier
Middle School in Flint.
   ``I always stress to my students to help their community, to not
always take for yourself,'' he said.
   Joe Williams, a Pittsburgh attorney representing Tabatha and her
parents, Roy and Sandra Foster, said the $14,000 gift is the
largest one so far. It brings total contributions to $320,000,
leaving about $225,000 in unpaid bills.

   Contract bridge players in France, Italy
and the United States sat down Saturday to play one another in a
computer-linked game.
   A computer dealt 32 bridge hands to 80 players in Milan, Italy;
80 in Paris; 100 in Houston, Texas; and 244 playing in Buffalo at
the North American Bridge Championships, sanctioned by the American
Contract Bridge League. Each table of four players in each city got
the same cards for each hand.
   The system, first demonstrated in Buffalo on Friday, dealt the
cards in trays in one city while dealing identical bridge hands in
the other cities.
   Dubbed ``Bridging the World,'' the international game was
described by Sherri Rosen of the bridge league as the first world
competition with computer-generated bridge hands and instant
scoring.
   ``It will give players here in Buffalo a chance to see how they
can compete against people in other parts of the world,'' she said.
   The scoring, she explained, was to be done in Paris and the
results transmitted to Buffalo.
   The Buffalo players also were competing among themselves in the
men's and women's pairs finals of the spring championships. At the
same time they were competing in the international game against
players in the other three cities.
   ``They came to Buffalo expecting to be in the men's and women's
pairs, but didn't expect to play an intercontinental match,'' said
Ms. Rosen.
   The 10-day spring championships, one of three major tournaments
that the American Contract Bridge League runs each year, have
attracted about 5,000 bridge players to Buffalo.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega rejected
Washington's demands that he resign and leave the country, his
press office reported Saturday.
   The military strongman also purged more officers from the
Defense Forces he commands in a move to strengthen his position.
   His press office said Noriega met Friday with ``some State
Department representatives'' and rejected their proposals for him
to leave the country ``as being unacceptable, illogical, and
anti-Panamanian.''
   The statement did not name the State Department representatives,
but it was known that William Walker, a ranking member of the
department's Latin American affairs bureau, met with Noriega Friday.
   In Washington, a Reagan administration official said Noriega had
indicated a willingness to step down as Panama's military chieftain
but was unwilling to go into exile, as the United States insisted.
   Opposition leaders called for a general strike Monday to protest
a nationwide state of emergency that restricted civil liberties.
   Walker, a deputy assistant secretary of state, reportedly was
empowered to tell Noriega the United States would not seek to
extradite the general on drug trafficking charges if he accepted
asylum in a third country, possibly Spain or France. Noriega was
indicted on the drug charges by a federal grand jury in Florida
last month.
   The Defense Forces press statement gave no details of the
American proposal, but said that while Noriega rejected it he
``totally reiterated his position of keeping the doors open to
dialogue.''
   It said Noriega and members of his high command met with the
Washington envoys and he and his officers ``are prepared to hold
all necessary conversations to resolve the Panamanian problem, but
without any type of conditions and always with the talks taking
into account national interests.''
   The Reagan official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the United States was insisting that the general leave the country
for fear he would continue exercising influence even after
resigning from his official post.
   Diplomatic and other sources said Noriega appeared to be
consolidating his base of power through the purges in the Defense
Forces after rejecting the U.S. demands.
   A source close to the military said 15 colonels and majors have
been forcibly retired or moved out of key positions since the head
of the National Police tried to remove Noriega in an unsuccessful
coup on Wednesday.
   Noriega's high command has acknowledged only five retirements
and one major demotion, the transfer on Saturday of Col. Lorenzo
Purcell from chief of the air force to an unspecified headquarters
desk job.
   The Defense Forces admit to holding five officers, including the
former police chief, Col. Leonidas Macias, arrested Wednesday
morning when the attempt to take over Noriega's headquarters went
awry.
   But the source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 12
officers have been arrested, ``three or four are in hiding and
quite a few more are suspected and being investigated _ up to 100.''
   The latest military purges came a day after the civilian
government, which answers to the general, declared a state of
emergency aimed at putting Panama's tottering economy back on
track. The move prompted an opposition coalition known as the
National Civic Crusade to call for an indefinite, nationwide
general strike for Monday, hoping to give a coup de grace to the
economy and a final push to Noriega.
   The United States has been pushing for Noriega's ouster since he
was indicted in Florida.
   The planned work stoppage comes at a time when many major
industries and smaller businesses already are closed by wildcat
strikes or a lack of business caused by a critical cash shortage.
   The cash crisis became acute on Feb. 26 when Noriega dismissed
the nation's civilian president, Eric Arturo Delvalle, prompting a
panic run on bank deposits. Most banks closed four days later after
the government acknowledged it did not have enough money to meet
the demand for withdrawals.
   Then, on March 3, the government ordered all banks closed until
arrangements could be made for their orderly reopening. They
remained closed through last week.
   The government was unable to fully meet its payroll last week
for some 130,000 public employees. Most got only $75 of their
semi-monthly wages.
   Economic discontent erupted in violent public demonstrations
Wednesday after word of the coup attempt spread. Workers went on
strike at the state-run electric and water utilities, ports in
Panama City and Colon, a main port 50 miles north, and a number of
government ministries.
   The government ordered the military to take control of the
utilities and ministries Wednesday, but at week's end the strikes
continued.
   Meanwhile, last week's coup attempt was depicted as poorly
planned and executed by several diplomatic, political and other
sources.
   Several, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the same story
of a colonel who overestimated his chances, came to the coup
unprepared and fell victim to foul luck.
   According to their version, Macias lined up support of several
officers with most of the rank-and-file of his own police force and
went to Noriega's headquarters early Wednesday. He was accompanied
by 12 other officers and a squad of policemen.
   But, according to the sources, when the group arrived at the
walled military compound in the heart of the capital of Panama
City, Macias decided they were too lightly armed. He and his fellow
officers marched to the base armory and demanded that it be opened,
the sources said.
   Once the officers were inside, the door was slammed shut behind
them and locked. Macias' police detachment, left behind in a
courtyard, quickly surrendered after headquarters guards began
shooting over their heads, the sources said.

   A former policeman has been
convicted of second-degree murder in the July 1978 slaying of two
young advocates of Puerto Rican independence, but another former
policeman has been acquitted.
   Rafael Moreno was found guilty of participating in the killing
of Carlos Soto Arrivi, 18, and Arnaldo Dario Rosado, 24, after both
had surrendered to police on a remote mountain top. Former police
Lt. Col. Angel Perez Casillas was found innocent of first-degree
murder.
   The slayings had caused political convulsions in the U.S.
commonwealth, and its Senate still is investigating the involvement
of top-ranking government officials.
   The verdicts came Friday in Superior Court after a trial that
lasted more than two months.
   Last August, five other policemen pleaded guilty to reduced
charges of second-degree murder and perjury stemming from the case,
and a sixth pleaded guilty to conspiracy and perjury. The six
received sentences ranging up to 30 years.
   In March 1985, all eight were convicted of perjury for having
lied to several federal grand juries investigating the killings.
Each was sentenced to terms up to 30 years.
   Soto Arrivi and Dario Rosado were killed by police after they
went the mountain with an undercover agent. The agent said the two
intended to sabotage a communications tower.
   Police initially claimed the two were killed in a shootout when
they resisted arrest, and then-Gov. Carlos Romero Barcelo of the
pro-statehood New Progressive Party called the policemen heroes.
   But in hearings in 1983 by the Senate, controlled by the Popular
Democratic Party, the youths were shown to have been executed at
close range after having surrendered.
   The Popular Democratic Party favors continuation of commonwealth
status, while the Puerto Rico Independence Party favors
independence, as do several extremist groups.
   Senate President Miguel Hernandez Agosto said earlier this month
that evidence uncovered during the trial indicates high officials
had planned in advance to entrap the youths.
   The government, which appointed a special independent prosecutor
to investigate the killings, spent about $6.5 million on the case.
   The families of the victims won a $1.5 million out-of-court
settlement from Puerto Rico last year after eight years of legal
battles.
   Puerto Rico, about 1,000 miles southeast of Florida, has been a
U.S. territory since 1898.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis won the
Kansas Democratic caucuses Saturday, fending off the urban strength
of Jesse Jackson who finished a surprising second.
   With 115 caucuses reporting, Dukakis had garnered 278 local
delegates for 36 percent, Jackson had 235 delegates for 31 percent
and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. 125 for 16 percent. Another 114
delegates, or 15 percent, were elected in uncommitted status.
   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt got only 12 delegates and
Illinois Sen. Paul Simon failed to pick up a single delegate.
Gephardt chose not to campaign in Kansas, spending his time instead
in Michigan ahead of its caucus on Saturday.
   No Democrats turned out in Greeley and Wichita counties in far
western Kansas, reducing the number of caucus sites from 117 to 115
and the number of local delegates elected from 768 to 764.
   ``It's terrific,'' Dukakis said at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner
in Detroit. ``We've had a major victory in Kansas and feel good
about it. Now we're on to Michigan and here we are.''
   The Massachusetts governor, asked about the significance of
winning in Kansas, said, ``I think it's the first farm and
agriculture state that I've won and won decisively. I think that's
a very good sign for the future.''
   Gephardt, speaking at the same Detroit dinner, said he wasn't
really concerned about Kansas.
   ``We really didn't mount much of an effort there,'' Gephardt
said. ``Our focus really has been on Michigan over the last week
and a half or two weeks.... I'm concerned about doing well Michigan
and I think we will.''
   Jackson beat Dukakis in Topeka and Kansas City, and held him to
a virtual draw in Wichita. Dukakis won in populous Johnson County,
which is suburban Kansas City.
   Dukakis won 42 delegates in Johnson County to 20 for Jackson and
19 for Gore, and Sedgwick County, which includes Wichita, with 44
delegates to 40 for Jackson and 31 for Gore.
   Jackson shocked most observers by winning Shawnee County, which
includes Topeka, with 32 delegates to Dukakis' 14 and Gore's four,
and claimed Wyandotte County, which includes Kansas City, as
expected, with 44 delegates to 13 for Dukakis and none for Gore.
   Twenty-six delegates were elected as uncommitted in the four
metropolitan counties. Gephardt got four of his delegates in
Johnson County, which borders Missouri, but none in any of the
other three big counties.
   Dukakis, who had been organized in Kansas far longer than any of
the other contenders, had been expected to do well. His state
chairman, Paul Feleciano of Wichita, had predicted Dukakis
eventually would claim between 20 and 25 of the Kansas national
delegates.
   The first larger county to report was Reno, just west of Wichita.
   Jackson, who didn't win any local delegates in Reno County four
years ago, got 75 votes from the 285 Democrats attending. Another
88 voted for Dukakis, 79 for Gore and 43 for Gephardt.
   Democrats attended 115 local caucuses, electing 764 delegates to
congressional district conventions on April 23 at which 26 of
Kansas' 43 delegates to the national convention will be picked.
Four state party officials are automatic delegates and the final 13
will be named on May 14 by the state committee.

   Twenty railroad cars, including nine
hauling chemicals, derailed Saturday, forcing authorities to
evacuate an entire town of 1,700 people for seven hours, officials
said.
   The derailment also led to a fire that destroyed an empty
building, said Deputy Sheriff Pat Miller. No injuries were
reported, however.
   Some of the cars struck power poles as they derailed, knocking
out electricity to the town for two hours, said a spokesman for
Northern States Power Co.
   A partial evacuation began when officials learned that two of
the tank cars carrying methanol, a type of alcohol, were leaking,
Miller said.
   The decision to evacuate the entire town was made at 11 a.m.,
after it was determined another tank car carrying sulfur dioxide
was damaged, said City Council member Val Lawler. He said the car
was not leaking, but the tanker's outer envelope was ruptured.
   Miller said the other tank cars, carrying anhydrous ammonia,
were not leaking.
   The car carrying sulfur dioxide was righted and stablized by
early afternoon and leaks on the two methanol alcohol tankers were
capped, said Phil Marbut, director of safety and hazardous
materials for the Minneapolis-based Soo Line. Residents were
allowed back in their homes shortly after 6 p.m.
   Many residents had begun leaving the town immediately after the
derailment, which occurred at 7:38 a.m., an official said. The
State Patrol also began closing off several highways to the town,
about 40 miles northwest of Minneapolis.
   Hazardous waste crews from the Minnesota Pollution Control
Agency were investigating, Miller said.
   The cause of the derailment was not known, said Soo Line
spokesman John Bergene. The eastbound train consisted of 65 cars
and the derailment occurred in the middle of the train, he said.

   Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega
indicated a willingness to step down as military commander but he
rejected efforts by two U.S. envoys to persuade him to go into
exile as well, an administration official said Saturday.
   ``He wants to stay on. He wants to stay in Panama,'' the
official said, commenting on the outcome of meetings Noriega had on
Friday with two State Department officials who were dispatched to
Panama.
   Noriega, at his request, met with Deputy Assistant Secretary
William Walker and the State Department's deputy legal adviser,
Michael Kozak. The two were said to be planning a return to
Washington this weekend.
   The administration official, who asked not to be identified,
said Noriega indicated a willingness to step down as commander of
the Defense Forces but made it clear he wished to remain in his
country.
   Other U.S. officials had said earlier that Walker and Kozak were
prepared to tell Noriega that the United States would not seek his
extradition on federal drug-trafficking charges if he sought asylum
in another country.
   The administration was willing to make that concession because
of concern over the high stakes that the United States has in that
country and the desire to end the political and economic chaos
there.
   Noriega's press office said Saturday that he rejected the U.S.
proposals for him to leave the country ``as being unacceptable,
illogical, and anti-Panamanian.''
   The Defense Forces press statement gave no details of the
American proposal, but said that while Noriega rejected it, he
``totally reiterated his position of keeping the doors open to
dialogue.''
   It said Noriega and members of his high command met with the
Washington envoys and he and his officers ``are prepared to hold
all necessary conversations to resolve the Panamanian problem, but
without any type of conditions and always with the talks taking
into account national interests.''
   Spain has said it would admit Noriega, provided he asked for
asylum and the United States did not seek his extradition.
   The U.S. official said that Noriega's departure from Panama is
the minimum prerequisite for settling the crisis, which has
featured widespread anti-Noriega protests and the virtual paralysis
of Panama's economy.
   According to the official, the administration fears that any
arrangement which does not include Noriega's exile would enable him
to continue his role as the dominant figure in Panama's political
life.
   Noriega probably would be able to continue ``pulling the
strings'' even if he resigned as chief of the defense forces, the
official said.
   A series of legal actions and other measures taken by the Reagan
administration has effectively dried up the flow of dollars into
Panama, leaving the country's banking system in crisis and the
government unable to meet its payroll.
   The official said the administration expects the situation in
Panama to worsen this coming week because of a general strike which
has been called by opposition forces and the Wednesday payday for
the 20,000 defense force personnel.
   There was considerable doubt that the government has enough
money to cover the military payroll, the official said.
   The crisis was touched off three weeks ago when President Eric
Arturo Delvalle attempted to fire Noriega but instead was fired
himself. Delvalle, who has been in hiding ever since, is regarded
by the United States as Panama's constitutional president.
   The administration has refused to recognize the successor
government in Panama, nominally headed by President Manuel Solis
Palma.

   A man shot to death four people, including
his brother and a pregnant woman, for playing a stereo too loud,
police said.
   Earl Losier Jr., 32, of Bangor was arrested at his parents'
apartment, in the building where the shootings occurred, and was
later charged in District Court with murdering his 26-year-old
brother, Stephen, authorities said.
   More charges were expected to be brought in connection with the
other slayings, said Fernand LaRochelle, chief of the Maine
attorney general's criminal division.
   Police identified the other victims as Peter Prendergast, 26, of
Brewer; Michael Prendergast, 31, of Bangor; and Sharon Prendergast,
23, of Bangor. Preliminary autopsy findings indicated that Ms.
Prendergast was pregnant, authorities said.
   Losier, who entered no plea to the charge, was ordered held
without bail and taken to the Augusta Mental Health Institute for a
psychological examination. He was transferred Saturday evening to
the Penobscot County Jail in Bangor.
   Authorities had not determined how the Prendergasts were related
and what their relationship to the suspect was, said police Lt. Don
O'Halloran.
   Bangor police Detective Roy E. McKinney said in an affidavit
filed in court that Losier told another policeman that he shot the
four ``because he was taking cough syrup and because they were
playing the stereo too loud.''
   O'Halloran also said that it appears Losier was upset about
noise ``but we really don't know ... why it escalated so rapidly.''
   In his affidavit, McKinney told the court that two policemen
were sent to the building and were told of a shooting by the
defendant's mother, Carol Losier.
   One investigator went to an upstairs apartment and found four
people with gunshot wounds, McKinney testified. A .45-caliber
semi-automatic handgun was seized at the scene, police said.
   According to Jeffrey Hjelm, an assistant attorney general
assigned to the case, two of the victims were taken to local
hospitals for treatment but did not survive.
   Hjelm would not elaborate on the circumstances of the shootings.
He said the case would probably be taken before a county grand jury.

<TEXT>
   A handful of white supremacists led a
peaceful march and rally Saturday to protest a three-month black
boycott of white-owned businesses, while some 300 blacks stood
silently on the sidelines.
   White supremacist Richard Barrett and about eight supporters
gathered on the steps of the Adams County Courthouse after a short
downtown march.
   Barrett, of Jackson, and his followers marched despite efforts
by Natchez officials to prevent it.
   Last month, the Board of Aldermen passed a parade ordinance that
stipulated a 30-day waiting period. Barrett said he notified the
city of his intent to march before the ordinance was passed and
filed for a temporary restraining order in U.S. District Court.
   City officials agreed out of court to grant Barrett the permit.
   ``We come to you in the name of freedom,'' Barrett told the
group, which included about 100 white onlookers. ``Those of you who
rob a merchant of his trade are guilty of breaking the law, `Thou
shalt not steal.'''
   Black residents started the boycott against white-owned business
after charging that the school system was discriminatory against
black students and educators.
   Natchez-Adams County Public School Superintendent Claude Porter
recently resigned after weeks of pressure from boycotters. One of
the signs carried by the white supremacists read ``Back Porter.''
   Some of the boycott organizers, including state Rep. Barney
Schoby, Natchez Alderman George Hardin and Adams County Supervisor
Phillip West, flanked Barrett and his followers on the courthouse
steps, but remained silent.
   Blacks carried signs that read ``We will be here when you're
gone,'' and ``We've paid our dues.''
   Natchez Police Chief Ken Farily said 40 police officers in riot
gear stood by during the parade and rally.

   The Defense Ministry said Honduran
warplanes bombed Sandinista positions Saturday inside Nicaraguan
territory near the border.
   The Nicaraguan statement said two American-made F-5 jets staged
a 10-minute attack Saturday afternoon in the Bocay area about 65
miles northeast of Managua, dropping four bombs against Sandinista
army positions but causing no damages.
   The ministry said that two F-5 warplanes flew over Sandinista
positions Saturday morning in the frontier sectors of Mukuwas, San
Andres de Bocay, Waniwas and Wayawas, producing no damage.
   The Defense Ministry said the area of the Saturday's attack was
the same where Honduran jets dropped several bombs on Thursday.
   There was no comment from the Honduran government on the
Nicaraguan report. Honduras has several thousand soldiers in the
Bocay border area under orders to drive out any Nicaraguan troops
they find in Honduran territory.
   The Bocay zone is where Honduras said Sandinista troops invaded
Honduran territory last week to attack bases of U.S.-backed
Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras.
   Honduran armed forces officials had said earlier Saturday that
the Nicaraguans were withdrawing.
   President Daniel Ortega, speaking Saturday before his government
reported the Honduran air raids, said he would ask the
International Court of Justice for an injunction preventing
military activities that could ``raise tension'' between Honduras
and Nicaragua.
   The move appeared designed to step up political pressure on the
United States, which last week sent 3,200 American troops to
neighboring Honduras as a warning to Nicaragua.
   The tribunal at The Hague, Netherlands, also known as the World
Court, has no power unless both sides of a dispute agree to its
jurisdiction.
   Ortega made his announcement in a talk show appearance on
government television during which he accused neighboring Honduras
of ``being an accomplice in the criminal activities'' of Contra
rebels against his regime.
   While he did not name the United States in his announcement,
Ortega appeared to be referring to the dispatch of American troops
to Honduras.
   Ortega asked the court to issue an injunction calling for
unspecified ``interim measures of protection'' against any military
activities ``that could raise tension even more between Honduras
and Nicaragua.''
   In Washington, Reagan administration officials said the dispatch
of troops to Honduras was in response to an appeal for help by that
country's president, Jose Azcona Hoyo.
   Azcona claims Sandinista troops are still inside Honduran
territory. But the Sandinistas say they are on their own side of
the border chasing U.S.-supported Contra rebels.
   Ortega said his appeal was part of a lawsuit that Nicaragua
filed several months ago with the World Court, demanding that it
condemn Honduras for allowing rebels to use its territory to mount
cross-border attacks.
   Honduras and the Contras claim the rebel camps are on the
Nicaraguan side of the ill-defined, sparsely populated border. The
Sandinistas contend the camps are inside Honduras.
   Nicaragua's civil war has taken more than 40,000 lives since
November 1981, when the Contras began fighting the Sandinista
government.

   Surrounded by soldiers,
harassed by a guerrilla ban on road travel and wary of violence,
Salvadorans vote Sunday for a new national legislature and
municipal officers nationwide.
   For the fifth time since a 1979 coup by reform-minded officers,
citizens of this Massachusetts-sized nation are casting their
ballots in an open election. El Salvador has a population of about
5 million.
   As before, they are doing it under less than ideal circumstances.
   On Saturday night, a car bomb exploded in front of a movie
theater in the affluent San Salvador neighborhood of Escalon.
Flying glass injured a woman ticket vendor.
   Jorge Medina, an employee of the Cinema theater, said vendor
Cecilia Torres was cut in the arm and back.
   The blast destroyed the car and damaged vehicles on either side.
   No group claimed responsibility. But leftist guerrillas said
they planted a March 11 bomb that injured two people in San
Salvador, and have been accused of killing the mayor of a northern
town and kidnapping a mayoral candidate last week.
   The election is for all 60 seats in the National Assembly, the
unicameral legislature. Voters are also electing mayors and
municipal councils in all the 262 cities and towns nationwide.
   The guerrillas, waging an 8-year-old war against the U.S.-backed
government, reject the elections as ``a farce.'' They contend that,
during wartime, popular will cannot be expressed at the polls.
   The rebels have been urging people to boycott the voting and
declared a ban on all road transportation in an effort to disrupt
the elections.
   The armed forces said 95 percent of the country's 56,000 troops
have been deployed to deliver ballots and ballot boxes and to
provide security at the 341 polling places set up throughout the
country.
   The Defense Ministry said it could guarantee secure voting
conditions in 244 of the 262 municipalities. Voters in the other 18
provincial communities, located in areas under the virtual control
of the guerrillas, are being allowed to cast ballots in the nearest
town they can.
   But few are likely to do so because of the transportation ban.
   Polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 5 p.m., and about 1.6 million
people have registered to vote. Early returns are not expected to
be announced before midnight.
   More than 100 observers from 45 countries and several
international organizations are on hand, including a 19-person
delegation from the United States, headed by Sen. Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., and Representative John Murtha, D-Penn, to watch that the
balloting and counting stays clean.
   The guerrillas have burned about 10 vehicles since they declared
their ban on travel at dawn Friday. Most of the sabotage was in the
eastern province of Usulutan, but at least three taxis were
reported burned in San Salvador.
   Traffic was drastically reduced in the capital and most of the
country Friday and Saturday. But, between state-owned buses the
government put into service and pickups converted by their
entrepreneurial owners those who needed to get around San Salvador
could generally find a ride.
   In the elections, the governing Christian Democratic Party of
President Jose Napoleon Duarte is expected to lose its majority in
the assembly. The rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance,
commonly known by its Spanish acronym of Arena, is expected to make
significant gains, but is unlikely to get a majority of its own.
   Leftist parties declined to present candidates, contending the
war makes a legitimate election impossible.
   The Christian Democrats have 33 deputies in the current
Assembly. Arena has 13. The center-rightist National Conciliation
Party has 12. There is one independent and one legislator from a
small rightist party called PAISA.
   Presidential elections are scheduled for next March. The current
campaign was characterized by mudslinging, with little emphasis on
proposals for resolving the country's tremendous problems caused by
the war.
   Guerrilla squads late Friday and early Saturday blew up
electricity transmission towers in several areas. The sabotage left
the entire northern province of Chalatenango without power, as well
as the northern part of San Salvador and parts of other provinces.
   The guerrillas on Thursday warned people to avoid concentrating
at polling places. The rebels said the heavy military presence at
the stations make them ``military targets.''
   Jose Antonio Gonzalez, an 18-year-old student who will vote for
the first time Sunday, said he disapproves of both the
transportation ban and the anti-election sabotage.
   ``It is a harsh reprisal against the people,'' he said, adding
that he thinks the elections are legitimate ``because through
elections, it is the people who decide what they want.''

   President Reagan blamed Congress Saturday for
the Nicaraguan border crossing into Honduras, and said rebels
fighting Nicaragua's Marxist-led government ``must have assistance
now.''
   In his weekly radio address, delivered from the Oval Office,
Reagan made his first substantial statement on Central America
since he ordered troops airlifted to Honduras on Wednesday.
   He said congressional rejection last month of renewed aid for
the Contra rebels in Nicaragua was ``giving the communist dictators
... a chance to smash their opponents.''
   ``Because of Congress' aid cutoff last month, the Sandinistas
have mounted their major cross-border incursion into Honduras,'' he
said.
   ``The freedom fighters are in desperate need of support,'' the
president added. ``If they are to remain a viable and effective
force, they must have assistance now.''
   The president spoke as administration officials, on the
condition they not be identified, were saying that Honduran
president Jose Azcona had asked that U.S. helicopters be used to
ferry Honduran troops to the fighting zone.
   The officials said no decision had been reached, but one said
the request was likely to be approved, perhaps this weekend.
   The New York Times, citing a senior administration official that
it did not identify, reported in Sunday's editions that the
administration already had rejected a proposal to use U.S.
helicopters to transport Honduran troops to the battle zone.
   The urgency of the Honduran request _ which never was made
formally _ diminished as the Sandinista offensive appeared to wind
down, and U.S. officials were able to persuade Honduras to accept a
more limited alternative, the Times reported. That alternative was
a joint training exercise in which U.S. helicopters would carry
Honduran troops to about 30 miles from the Nicaraguan border but
100 miles from the battle zone.
   The Hondurans were expected to request the exercise formally,
and the United States will agree, the official told the Times.
   White House spokeswoman Liz Murphy said late Saturday that no
decisions had been made on whether U.S. helicopters would ferry
Honduran troops to or near the border and said all queries should
be directed to the Pentagon.
   Maj. Bill O'Connell, a Pentagon spokesman, said he knew nothing
about it and Nancy Beck, a State Department spokeswoman, said she
had no comment.
   One official, also speaking on condition he not be named, told
The Associated Press that the Nicaraguan forces were withdrawing
from Honduras. According to administration estimates, 1,600 to
2,000 Sandinista soldiers had crossed the border.
   This official said the Contra rebels remained an effective
fighting force, but faced serious short-term supply problems.
   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, the Honduran armed forces
spokesman, said in a telephone interview Saturday that the
Nicaraguan troops were withdrawing from Honduran territory and that
only about 600 Sandinista soldiers remained inside Honduras.
   ``This is a good sign on the part of the Managua regime, so that
peace can prevail in Central America,'' he said.
   However, the Nicaraguan Defense Ministry said Saturday night
that Honduran warplanes had bombed Sandinista positions inside
Nicaragua in the Bocay region, the same area where Honduran jets
had dropped several bombs on Thursday.
   There was no immediate comment on the Nicaraguan report by the
Honduran government, but The Washington Post reported in Sunday's
editions that Honduran national radio said the bombings were of
Nicaraguan positions in southern Honduras. The radio said the raids
were ordered after U.S. and Honduran intelligence found Nicaraguans
laying mines in 50 square miles of Honduran territory as they
withdrew.
   A Nicaraguan Defense Ministry spokesman denied that troops were
sowing mines in Honduras, the Post reported.
   Reagan opened his radio speech with a reference to a jovial
get-together on Thursday with congressional leaders, saying,
``There was a nice celebration of St. Patrick's Day up on Capitol
Hill this week; but believe me, that wasn't the only reason
Congress knew I had my Irish up.''
   ``Just as the heroic efforts of the democratic resistance have
forced the communists to cut back on their aggression abroad and to
make peace concessions, the Congress in a close vote, decided to
cut off aid to the freedom fighters,'' he said.
   The president scoffed at the notion that the halt in aid
amounted to ``giving peace a chance,'' as some of its supporters
argued.
   ``Instead,'' he said, ``the aid cutoff is giving the communist
dictators a chance, a chance they long hoped for. A chance to smash
their opponents.''
   The president said the Sandinistas had responded by hardening
their negotiating posture, firing Cardinal Orlando y Bravo as
mediator and sending ``mobs of thugs against peaceful opposition
groups.''
   ``And now, instead of negotiating for a cease-fire, they have
launched a major military assault on the weakened Contras _
invading democratic Honduras in the process,'' he said.
   ``Now from the beginning, our Central American policy has been
designed to prevent another Cuba and to let the people of Nicaragua
win back their freedom and their independence from the Soviet Union
on their own _ to do this without having to commit American
military personnel,'' Reagan told his radio audience.
   ``But now, because of Congress' aid cutoff last month, the
Sandinistas have mounted their major cross-border incursion into
Honduras,'' he said.
   Referring to his dispatch of U.S. troops to Honduras to engage
in exercises, the president said, ``Our purpose is to send a signal
to the governments and peoples of Central America about the
seriousness with which we view the situation.''

<TEXT>
   Two British soldiers were shot
to death Saturday after mourners at an IRA funeral dragged them
from a car, beat them with crowbars and hoisted them naked before
cheering onlookers, witnesses and police said.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for the
killings in a statement released to Belfast media. The British army
said the plainclothes soldiers came upon the funeral by accident.
   The soldiers, blood streaming from their heads, were pulled to
the top of a 12-foot-high wall around a football field for the
crowd to see, witnesses said.
   They were then hauled behind a building and shots were heard. A
short while later their bullet-riddled bodies were found in a
vacant lot.
   Early Sunday, the army identified the victims as corporals Derek
Wood, 24, and David Howes, 23. It said both were members of the
Royal Corps of Signals and were unmarried. The signals corps often
is engaged in monitoring electronic communications.
   It was the second fatal attack in four days at a Belfast
funeral. Three people were killed in a cemetery attack Wednesday.
   The killings, which brought the Northern Ireland death toll to
22 so far this year, occurred as thousands of mourners followed the
coffin of Kevin Brady, an IRA member and one of the victims of
Wednesday's violence.
   Witnesses said the car carrying the soldiers sped toward the
Brady cortege as it wound its way through predominantly Roman
Catholic West Belfast. The car swerved and began to back up but was
engulfed by angry mourners, some brandishing crowbars, who assumed
the men were undercover agents.
   One man climbed onto the roof of the car and pounded it with an
iron bar. The windows were smashed, a shot was heard and there were
shouts of ``He's got a gun!'' followed by ``We've got two Brits!''
   There were reports that a priest who tried to give one of the
victims mouth-to-mouth resuscitation after the shootings was chased
away and that more shots were then fired into the bodies.
   Many cheered as the naked bodies were hoisted into view, but
others, shocked by the grisly display, were weeping and trembling
as the cortege resumed. The funeral was completed without further
incident.
   ``The two men were badly beaten, they were stripped and
spread-eagled and were soaked in blood,'' said a witness who
requested anonymity. ``They had deep gashes on their heads where
they had been beaten.''
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force, said
they were ``soldiers who were on duty,'' and said three people were
being questioned.
   A police statement said the killings were ``an obscenity
committed by depraved and perverted people.''
   A British army spokesman said the soldiers were not assigned to
monitor the funeral and were believed to have accidentally
encountered the cortege while traveling from West Belfast to
Lisburn, the British army headquarters in Northern Ireland.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called the killings ``an act of
appalling savagery.''
   ``There seems to be no depths to which these people will not
sink,'' she said.
   Irish Premier Charles Haughey also condemned them.
   ``I once again appeal for an end to this fearsome cycle of death
and suffering,'' he said in Dublin.
   Haughey later said ``urgent action and initiatives'' were needed
to halt the deteriorating situation in Northern Ireland.
   He did not elaborate beyond saying peace and stability could be
achieved only through the political process.
   Sinn Fein, the outlawed IRA's political wing, claimed the
incident ``bears the hallmarks of an official British undercover
dirty tricks operation.'' Sinn Fein officials said the men were
killed with their own pistols.
   It said the men could have been planning an attack on the
funeral that would then be blamed on Protestant militants.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said no police were present
because assurances had been given that the IRA would not turn the
funeral into an illegal paramilitary spectacle.
   On Wednesay, a gunman fired shots and tossed grenades into a
crowd of mourners, killing three people and wounding 68.
   Brady was shot as he and other mourners chased the attacker.
   Michael Stone, a 33-year-old Protestant extremist, was being
held and police say they have arrested a second person linked to
the shooting.
   The attack came during funeral services for three unarmed IRA
members killed on March 6 by British troops in Gibraltar. They
allegedly were planning to detonate a car bomb during a British
military ceremony.
   More than 2,630 people have died in 19 years of political and
sectarian strife in Northern Ireland.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to drive the British from Northern
Ireland. The mainly Catholic guerrilla group wants to unite the
predominantly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Catholic
Irish Republic under socialist rule.
   Protestant militants reject unity with the Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Carter Administration Reportedly Stalled Noriega Indictment in
1980</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
might have been indicted in 1980 for illegal arms purchases but the
Carter administration did not want to upset the delicate
relationship it had with Panama at the time, The Washington Post
said in Sunday's editions.
   ``We had evidence to indict him for conspiracy,'' David Kimbler,
a former agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms who
was one of the key investigators, told the Post. ``But ... the
Justice Department didn't want it.''
   The case stayed alive for several years, but Noriega was not
indicted, the newspaper said. Separate charges against several of
Noriega's alleged co-conspirators were filed in 1979 and dropped
because of a technical flaw. Those charges also were not pursued.
   ``The State Department didn't want to see this case go to
trial,'' David Goodhart, the lawyer for one defendant, told the
Post. ``Noriega had a rabbi.''
   The criminal case against Noriega, then head of Panama's
intelligence service, developed during a delicate time in
U.S.-Panamanian relations.
   In December 1979, Panama helped the Carter administration by
giving refuge to the deposed shah of Iran.
   Six weeks later, on Jan. 31, 1980, U.S. Attorney Jack Eskenazi
of Miami wrote a letter to a senior Justice Department official
advising that U.S. Customs agents had sufficient evidence to indict
Noriega for the illegal export of $2 million in arms, the Post said.
   Eskenazi asked the Justice Department to decide how to proceed.
   The Post, which published a copy of the confidential letter,
quoted Eskenazi as saying: ``Unfortunately, those of us in law
enforcement in Miami find ourselves frequently attempting to
enforce the laws of the United States, but simultaneously being
caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no
control (and often, no knowledge).''
   Officially, the Justice Department responded by asking for more
information. Unofficially, the department made clear that the State
Department did not want the case to go forward, the Post said.
   State Department officials who dealt with Panama at the time
told the Post they could not recall any effort to prosecute Noriega
on gun running. ``I really don't remember,'' said Brandon Grove,
who was deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs at the time.
   Robert Pastor, President Jimmy Carter's National Security
Council staff member responsible for Latin America, expressed
surprise when told of the Eskenazi letter, according to the Post.
   ``It is incredible to me that anyone in the Carter
administration would have tried to prevent prosecution of any
Panamanian involved in arms trafficking or that anybody would have
blinked or ignored such information regarding Panamanians involved
in arms trafficking,'' Pastor told the Post.

   A bomb exploded Saturday night in a
suburban bar frequented by servicemen from a nearby U.S. Air Force
facility, wounding four Americans and nine other people, police
reported.
   A police spokesman said the bomb went off at 11:10 p.m. in
Oscar's bar near the U.S. base at Hellenikon Airport in suburban
Glyfada.
   ``It apparently was a powerful device placed in a bag hanging
from a coat-rack close to the bar counter,'' said the spokesman,
who was not identified in line with police regulations.
   No individual or group asserted responsibility for the bombing,
according to police.
   Two Greeks were admitted to the Asklipeion Voula Hospital with
first- and second-degree burns, Dr. Ioannis Tsigalis told reporters.
   He said five Greeks, two Britons and four American servicemen
were treated for cuts and puncture wounds from flying glass and
metal.
   ``We had to extract some fragments of metal embedded in cuts,
but there were no serious injuries,'' Tsigalis said.
   The police spokesman said the Americans were transferred to the
hospital at the U.S. fase.
   A hospital official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, gave
the names of the Americans as Timothy Johnson, John Fines, Ricky
Hoover and Larry Morrison, but he said he did not know their ages
or hometowns.
   There was no immediate comment from the American Embassy or
officials at the Air Force base.
   Witnesses said some 25 people were at the bar, which is
decorated with American flags, when the bomb went off.
   ``I was standing at the bar having a drink when it blew up in
front of me. There was a really loud explosion and I got dizzy and
fell down,'' said a Greek patron, Costas Pabalos, 25.
   The blast blew debris into the street and shattered windows in a
nearby restaurant and apartment building.
   ``We heard a loud blast and saw people running out of Oscar's.
There was a man running out of there screaming with his clothes on
fire,'' said Dimitris Katsounis, the restaurant owner.
   Oscar's is a noted meeting place for American servicemen from
the base and other foreigners living in Glyfada, a seaside suburb
11 miles south of Athens.
   More than 1,200 Americans are stationed at the 7206 Air Base
Group at Hellenikon. Many live off base in the Glyfada and Voula
suburbs.
   American servicemen have been targeted by the left-wing
guerrilla group calling itself November 17.
   In April and August 1987, the group staged bomb attacks in
Athens against buses carrying American military personnel. More
than 30 Americans were injured in the attacks, one seriously.
   In February 1985, a bomb exploded in Bobby's Bar in Glyfada and
more than 30 Americans were wounded. No group clamed responsibility
for that attack and no arrests have been made.
   Saturday's attack occurred one week after Greek and American
officials completed a fourth round of talks on a new agreement for
the four U.S. military bases in Greece.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou's socialist government has said a new
bases agreement would be submitted for approval in a referendum
before taking effect.
   Many leftist groups oppose the U.S. military presence in Greece,
a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

   Inventors whose developments have affected
nearly every American in one way or another, and led to major
changes in society, will be added to the National Inventors Hall of
Fame.
   Special ceremonies have been scheduled for March 27 to honor the
developers of oral contraceptives, computer memory, television
receivers and elevators, the U.S. Patent Office announced Friday.
   The four new members will be inducted in ceremonies at the
Patent Office in Arlington, Va. They bring to 72 the membership in
the Hall of Fame, which was opened in 1973 with a plaque honoring
Thomas A. Edison.
   New members of the Hall of Fame are:
   _Elisha Graves Otis of Halifax, Vt., who patented the elevator
in 1861.
   _Frank B. Colton, born in Poland, who received patents for oral
contraceptives in 1954 and 1955.
   _Louis W. Parker, born in Budapest, Hungary, who is credited
with developing the television receiver.
   _An Wang, a native of Shanghai, China, who developed the
magnetic pulse controlling device, the principle on which computer
memory operates.
   Graves becomes the latest inductee selected for development of
products that have become nearly universal.
   Others whose work is similarly well known include Edison for his
electric light, the Wright brothers for airplanes, Charles Goodyear
for vulcanized rubber and Rudolf Diesel for the internal combustion
engine.
   Colton joins Carl Djerassi, an Austrian-born chemist who was
inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1978 for his pioneering work on
oral contraceptives.
   Parker's television receiver glows in nearly every American home
today, and in the Hall of Fame he joins William D. Coolidge, who
invented the vacuum tube; Vladimir Zworykin, who developed the
cathode ray tube used for television pictures and Philo T.
Farnsworth, who developed the scanning, contrast and focusing
systems for television.
   In the development of computers, An Wang joins several other
pioneers already in the Hall of Fame. They include calculating
machine pioneer William Seward Burroughs; George R. Stibitz who
developed modern complex computer systems; Robert N. Noyce, a
pioneer in developing semiconductor devices; Jack S. Kilby who
developed miniaturized circuits and Jay W. Forrester, a leader in
early digital information storage.

   Rangers at Padre Island National
Seashore were negligent when they failed to arrest a drunken
driver, making the government liable for an accident that maimed a
motorcyclist, a judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Spencer Williams said after his ruling
Thursday that he would hold a hearing later to set damages.
   Randy William Crider, 33, of Corpus Christi, was driving his
motorcycle in Corpus Christi on July 24, 1983, when he was struck
head-on by a car driven by John Lee Landry. Crider lost an arm and
a leg.
   Landry, now 23, later pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and
was sentenced to eight years in prison.
   Crider sued the U.S. government for damages, saying that if park
Rangers Larry Couser and James F. Copeland had arrested Landry 10
hours earlier when they stopped him for speeding, the accident
would not have occurred.
   The suit did not name the rangers as defendants, but as
employees of the National Park Service.
   The rangers and the U.S. attorney defending the case said they
did not know whether the ruling would cause rangers to make more
arrests.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Wayne Campbell said Friday no decision
has been made on whether to appeal, but added, ``I'm not jumping up
and down to do it because the judge gave me a very fair trial.''
   Campbell said if the government appeals, it would be over the
extent of liability of law officers.
   Crider said the rangers stopped Landry after clocking his car on
radar at 40 mph in a 15 mph zone. Two teen-agers were riding on the
hood of Landry's car.
   Couser said he ticketed Landry for possession of marijuana,
possession of alcohol by a minor, speeding and having no liability
insurance.
   According to testimony this week, Landry had consumed seven or
eight ounces of liquor and had smoked several marijuana cigarettes
in the three or four hours before he was stopped for speeding.
   ``It is clear to me that this (failing to arrest Landry) was an
act of negligence and that, as a consequence, an accident
occurred,'' Williams said.

   A black churchworker and a white
student staying at his home as part of a church-run interracial
exchange program were detained Friday by police, the program's
organizers said.
   The student was freed several hours later, but the black
remained in custody, organizers said.
   The white man ``was released because of his white skin, while
his host is still detained because of his black skin,'' said the
Rev. Nico Smith, a Dutch Reformed minister and an organizer of the
interdenominational program.
   Smith was the first white the government allowed to live in the
black township of Mamelodi, the main black township outside the
capital of Pretoria.
   Murray Hofmeyr, who is white, and Sandy Lebese, a black, were
picked up there early Friday, according to the Rev. Kevin Cochrane.
   Hofmeyr, 29, was among 170 whites who moved in Wednesday for
four days with black families in Mamelodi. In turn, 40 blacks were
sent to live with whites in Pretoria.
   Hofmeyr, a doctoral candidate in theology, was staying with
Lebese, a field worker with the Pretoria Council of Churches.
Lebese, 31, was imprisoned from 1977 to 1983 on a sabotage
conviction.
   Colleagues speculated that Lebese was detained because of his
membership in the Mamelodi Youth Organization, an anti-apartheid
community group. Five other group members were detained Friday,
according to Anthea Tasker, a spokeswoman for the exchange program.
   Police were asked about the detentions but had no immediate
comment.
   Participants in the exchange issued a statement expressing
``shock and horror'' at the police action: ``It is incomprehensible
to us that these two good Christian men could be detained at the
very time they were working toward real peace in our land. Such
action raises very serious questions about the true motives of the
security forces''
   One of the participants in the exchange, Nick Paton, is the
grandson of novelist Alan Paton. The younger Paton said police came
to the Mamelodi home he was visiting at 2:30 a.m. Friday, woke him
to ask what he was doing there, and left.
   On Thursday, Hofmeyr spoke enthusiastically of his first night
in a black township. He said he went disco-hopping while new-found
black friends bought his drinks.
   Lebese said at the time, ``A lot of whites don't even know if
it's legal for them to come to Mamelodi.
   ``They think we're a bunch of dangerous radicals,'' he added.
``This week everyone has a chance to talk in a relaxed
environment.''
   Most South African blacks know more about how whites live
because blacks often work at white homes and businesses. Whites
seldom venture into black townships.
   Henry Lederle, a white theology professor, said participating
whites are already committed to ending apartheid, the system of
racial segregation in South Africa.
   ``The whites still need this type of exposure,'' he added.
``It's one thing to say you want to end apartheid; it's another to
learn about the problems it creates.''

   The Soviet Union has been given the go-ahead
to buy an additional 1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Acting Undersecretary Thomas O. Kay said that since last April,
the subsidized sales of wheat to the Soviets have totaled more than
10.8 million tons under previously announced allocations of the
department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   The new line of subsidized wheat was announced after a regularly
scheduled meeting with Moscow representatives to review operations
of the five-year agreement calling for annual sales of U.S. grain
to the Soviet Union.
   In a related but separate development, formal negotiations were
scheduled to open in Washington on Saturday on the possibility of a
new long-term agreement. The current pact will expire Sept. 30.
   Kay told reporters he would not comment on prospects for a new
long-term agreement. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Alan F.
Holmer is the U.S. team leader for those negotiations.
   More than 6.9 million tons of the 10.8 million tons of
subsidized wheat bought by the Soviet Union has gone to fill its
commitment under the fifth and final year of the agreement.
   The pact calls on Moscow to buy at least 9 million tons of grain
annually and specifies that the purchases include a minimum of 4
million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have the option of
buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans,
with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a
maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent.
   If more than 12 million tons are wanted in a year, the Soviets
are required to seek U.S. approval.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat or soybeans.
   If Moscow buys all of the new authorization, that would push
wheat sales in the last year of the agreement to more than 7.9
million tons. All of the wheat has been subsidized.
   In addition, the Soviets have bought 3.97 million tons of
non-subsidized corn, including 500,000 tons announced Friday. Sales
also include 813,000 tons of U.S. soybeans and 1.3 million tons of
soybean meal.
   Kay said official U.S. approval had been given the Soviets to
exceed the agreement's limit of 12 million tons in the final year,
but he said there was no indication how much more may be bought.
   Under EEP, private exporters are given surplus commodities owned
by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. so they can sell a
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive
world prices.
   The subsidies, or bonuses, have run between about $27 per ton to
more than $40 per ton, roughly 74 cents to $1.09 per bushel.

   A federal grand jury in San Diego has indicted
a Mexican woman formerly employed at the U.S. consulate in Tijuana,
Mexico, for embezzling about $73,000, the State Department said
Friday.
   The six-count indictment alleges that Mercedes B. Bustamente,
34, employed as head cashier at the consulate, embezzled the money
during three separate periods in the spring of 1986.
   She also was charged with unlawfully transporting a portion of
the stolen proceeds from Tijuana to San Isidro, Calif.; with
falsifying an accountability record; and with making false
statements to federal investigators to hide her activities.
   The embezzelment and interstate transportation counts each carry
a maximum prison term of 10 years and a maximum fine of $250,000.
The false statement counts each carry similar penalties.

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as
of March 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 7.57 million
head, up 6 percent from a year ago and 3 percent from two years
ago, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in February totaled 1.53 million
head, up 3 percent from a year ago and 4 percent above two years

   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 1.37 million head, down 5 percent from a year
ago but 12 percent more than in February 1986.
   As of March 1, feedlot inventories were larger than a year
earlier in five states and down in Arizona and Iowa. The states
account for about three-fourths of the nation's beef production.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as
of March 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year
earlier.

<HEAD>Army Will Test Its Buildings for Radon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army announced Friday it would follow the
lead of the Air Force and begin testing buildings on its bases for
the natural radioactive gas radon.
   ``The first structures to be tested will be day care centers,
hospitals, schools and living areas,'' the Army said in a statement.
   ``The next set of structures to be tested will be those having
24-hour operations such as operations centers, training areas and
research, development, test and evaluation facilities. Last to be
tested will be all other routinely inhabited structures.''
   ``All radon measurements will be completed by the end of fiscal
1991 (Sept. 30, 1991),'' the service said.
   Each building will be screened initially for 90 days, and any
structure showing a radon level greater than 20 picocuries per
liter of air will be scheduled for corrective action in six months
or less, the Army said.
   Ultimately, any structure showing a radon level of 4 picocuries
per liter or more will receive corrective sealing, the Army added.
   Radon is a colorless, odorless natural product of decaying
uranium in the soil. Medical research has indicated that exposure
to high levels of radon may increase the risk of lung cancer. The
Environmental Protection Agency's guideline for radon exposure is 4
picocuries per liter of air.
   The Air Force announced plans to begin testing buildings on its
bases around the world for radon last November. The Navy and Marine
Corps are said to be considering similar moves.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During his visit next week, Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze will participate in a ribbon-cutting
ceremony opening the Washington end of U.S.-Soviet ``risk reduction
centers'' to improve communication between the two governments, the
State Department said Friday.
   Shevardnadze and Secretary of State George P. Shultz agreed last
September to open the centers to exchange information under
treaties to cut nuclear weaponry, avoid accidental war and reduce
incidents at sea.
   The centers are far more sophisticated than the famous ``hot
line,'' which President John F. Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev set up after the 1962 Cuban missile crisis to permit
direct communications between Soviet and U.S. leaders.
   State Department officials gave reporters an advance peek at the
center, a 12-by-18 foot room on the 7th floor of department
headquarters, about a mile from the White House.
   Access to the windowless room is by twin steel security doors,
only one of which can be opened at a time, to prevent unauthorized
access.
   Inside are four computer consoles and color monitors; two for
receiving data, one to transmit and one as a backup.
   The center will be manned around the clock by one communications
specialist and a Russian-speaking watch officer.
   David Swartz, staff director of the center, said there is a
corresponding installation in Moscow but ``we don't know where it
is.''
   Both sides have been testing the center since March 15 by
sending hourly messages. The State Department sent a map of the
Washington metro system on a data transmitter and the Soviets
responded on Friday with a map of the Moscow subway system. Time
for a page: about 150 seconds.
   Swartz said the U.S. center cost $1 million.
   The centers, first proposed by senators Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and
John Warner, R-Va., are designed to exchange information under the
proposed Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty and two pacts
signed in the 1970s.
   They are the 1971 agreement on measures to reduce the risk of
outbreak of nuclear war and the 1972 pact on the prevention of
incidents on the high seas.
   The information could include notification of planned ballistic
missile tests and hazards to navigation.
   ``The purpose of the NRRC is to help avoid situations that could
lead through miscalculation, accident, of misinterpretation to a
crisis,'' the department said.

   Following are excerpts from the
Soviet-Yugoslav declaration Friday as translated from
Serbo-Croatian by The Associated Press:
   The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics stress the historic role and unpassable
value of universal principles contained in the Belgrade (1955) and
Moscow (1956) declarations, and especially: Mutual respect of
independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, equality and
non-interference in internal affairs in any form. Their adequate
implementation has played the crucial role in the normalization of
inter-state relations and the development of all-around and stable
cooperation. The two sides shall continue to adhere by these
principles.
   The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics are building and advancing. Their
relations starting from the unconditional respect of
particularities of the paths and norms of their socialist
development and different international positions.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Proceeding from the conviction that no one has a monopoly over
the truth, the two sides declare that they have no pretensions of
imposing their concept of social development on anyone. The success
of any path to socialism is tested through socio-political practice
and confirmed by the results of social progress.
   The League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Communist Party
of the Soviet Union will strive to enrich cooperation and cultivate
permanent political dialogue for the purpose of an exhaustive
exchange of opinions and experiences about current issues of
socialist development in the two countries, about socialism as a
world process, about global issues of the world and social
progress, and international cooperation and strengthening
confidence between peoples.
   The two countries consider the development of socialist
self-management, in keeping with the specificities of each country,
to be of the highest importance. It ensures the genuine authority
of the people and the freedom of the individual and is a dependable
guarantee against any administrative-bureaucratic distortion of
socialism, against dogmatism and voluntarism.

   - The policy of non-aliignment is against imperialism,

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The decisive step in the realization of this striving is halting
the armaments race and opening an irreversible process of nuclear
and conventional disarmament for the purpose of general and full
disarmament under effective international control.
   Realistic removal of the danger of a nuclear catastrophe, which
implies a full and general liquidation of nuclear armament,
represents the highest and most urgent interest of all peoples.
   This process has been opened by the treaty of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America about
destruction of the rockets of the medium- and long-range variety
and thus encourages hopes of mankind for a safer future.
   It is indispensable and possible that, without delay, the
preparation and conclusion of an agreement on a general and full
ban of nuclear arms testing be taken up, with the strictest steps
of control in this area, preventing militarization of the cosmos
which belongs to mankind, and a ban and liquidation of all kinds of
weapons for mass destruction.

freedoms enable man to take part in creating a condition of life,

   An explosion and flash fire at a
sugar refinery burned at least seven workers Friday, three
critically, officials said.
   The blast caused heavy damage to the Union Sugar division of
Holly Sugar Corp. plant, said Charlie Johnson, a Santa Barbara
County Fire Department spokesman.
   Fire Capt. Jim Trask said that the blast was caused by sugar
dust but that investigators had yet to determine what ignited it.
   Johnson likened the accident to grain elevator explosions, in
which fine particles of wheat often are ignited by a spark. ``It
appears to be very similar to a dust explosion common in the
Midwest,'' Johnson said.
   Three workers were in critical condition at Marion Medical
Center and were transferred to the burn center at Sherman Oaks
Community Hospital, said Ethel Donati, a nursing supervisor at
Marion.
   Four victims were in satisfactory condition at Valley Community
Hospital, said nursing supervisor Maureen Shannon.
   The blast occurred on the second floor of a six-story brick
warehouse in a room where workers said different grades of sugar
are sorted. The fire was contained quickly, Johnson said.
   The plant, which produces beet sugar, is isolated from other
buildings about 5 miles outside this town 125 miles northwest of
Los Angeles.
   Fire investigators were joined by inspectors from the state
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, building inspectors
and county health officials. Holly Sugar Corp. has headquarters in
Colorado Springs, Colo.

   The International Monetary Fund on Friday
announced a $317 million loan to Argentina that will help it pay
back a $500 million loan from the United States and keep up with
interest payments on its $50 billion foreign debt.
   The fund said the loan was granted because heavy rains, floods
and lower market prices cut into Argentina's earnings from the
export of grain and oilseeds.
   The U.S. loan of $500 million, granted earlier this year, was
intended to bridge over the period until the fund made its decision.
   An international monetary source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the fund also approved release of $225 million next
week, part of a loan that depends on President Raul Alfonsin's
government meeting its promises to the fund on new policies. The
government has pledged to keep down its budget deficit and take
other economy measures.
   Argentina already owes the fund more than $3.5 billion.
   The decisions by its Board of Executive Directors, which
represents the 151 member governments, are expected to trigger
release of loans to Argentina promised by banks. The banks agreed
to do their lending in tandem with the fund, disbursing their loans
as the IMF gave its seal of approval to Argentina's efforts.
   The loans may provide only a temporary respite, since the need
to pay interest is a continuing drain on Argentina's dwindling
reserves. Some Argentine political leaders have been pressing
Alfonsin to suspend interest payments, as Brazil did last year.
Brazil has resumed payments, but arrangements have not been
completed on the money owed from 1987.
   According to the World Bank, debts of Third World countries will
amount to $1.245 trillion by the end of this year.
   Argentina's troubles are compounded by inflation which reached
175 percent last year, more than twice the 1986 rate. Economy
Minister Juan V. Sourrouille has predicted that this year's rate
will be more than 100 percent and some forecasts have put it as
high as 20 percent for March alone.

   Eastern Airlines ``isn't above the law'' and
should be penalized for trying to sell its East Coast shuttle
operation in violation of a court order, the union for the
carrier's mechanics told a federal judge Friday.
   But U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt said he would not grant
the labor organization's request that he force Frank Lorenzo,
Eastern's chief executive, to appear before him to promise that he
would halt efforts to shed the shuttle.
   Pratt said at a hearing called to determine sanctions to be
levied against Eastern that he would announce the penalties Monday.
   ``We're not going to, at this juncture, order Mr. Lorenzo to
come in here and genuflect,'' Pratt told lawyers for the
International Association for Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
   The union also had asked Pratt to order Eastern to halt all
efforts to gain federal permission to sell the shuttle, restore
jobs to workers who retired after learning of the shuttle sale
proposal, and fine the carrier $20,000 per day for any future
violations of the judge's orders.
   On March 10, Pratt found the Miami-based carrier in contempt for
trying to sell its profitable shuttle service to its parent
company, Texas Air Corp., for $225 million. Lorenzo also heads
Texas Air.
   Pratt ruled that in trying to sell the shuttle, the financially
ailing Eastern was violating his July 2, 1987, injunction ordering
the airline to maintain the status quo of its contract with the
machinists.
   The union, which represents 12,000 employees, has argued that by
selling the shuttle to another company set up by Texas Air, the
labor group's bargaining power with Eastern would be weakened
seriously. The sale would have required the transfer of 6,000
Eastern employees to the new company.
   ``We believe that, as a result of the order, negotiations will
be normalized and we hope to reach agreement in a collective
bargaining process that will be both satisfactory to the company
and the union,'' said Charles E. Bryan, president of machinist's
union at Eastern.
   ``Judge Pratt was very straightforward and objective in his
enforcement'' of the law, Bryan said in a statement. ``He has
restored our confidence in the federal courts and provided justice
for all Eastern Airlines employees.''
   Joseph Guerrieri, Jr., lawyer for the machinists, said of
Lorenzo, ``He isn't above the law. Eastern Airlines isn't above the
law. I think he has to come to understand that.''
   But John J. Gallagher, the attorney representing Eastern, said
the airline was now complying with Pratt's orders and that there
was no reason to compel an appearance by Lorenzo. He said the
machinists have long had a hostile relationship with Eastern
executives, even before Lorenzo acquired the carrier.
   ``Now there's a new management so there's a new black hat,''
Gallagher said.
   Labor and management at Eastern have been battling for years.
Under Lorenzo, Eastern has tried a series of moves that the airline
says are designed to increase efficiency but the union has claimed
are efforts to break their power.
   The Eastern shuttle serves Washington, New York and Boston.

   A federal grand jury indicted seven
people in Puerto Rico, New York and Florida on charges of belonging
to a drug ring that sent cocaine and heroin to Puerto Rico, the FBI
announced Friday.
   Three of the suspects were taken into custody in San Juan and a
fourth was arrested in New York, according to FBI spokesman Angel
Berlingeri.
   He said arrest warrants have been issued for two suspects in
Puerto Rico and one in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   All seven are charged in the indictments opened Friday with
distributing and selling cocaine and heroin, Berlingeri reported.
   He said more arrests are expected as a result of an
investigation that started in the late 1970s of drugs shipped from
New York and Florida to Puerto Rico for sale on this U.S.
commonwealth island.
   Authorities reported one suspect, Alberto Aviles Rodriguez,
appeared voluntarily before U.S. Magistrate Justo Arenas Friday
morning. They said Juan R. Berganzo Romero and Armando Serrano
Miranda were arrested in San Juan and taken into court in the
afternoon. Arenas ordered all three held without bail.
   The FBI said Guiseppe Tabbita was arrested in New York, but did
not elaborate, and that a man identified as Guiseppe Pellerito was
being sought in Fort Lauderdale.
   It said the others named in the indictment and being sought are
Puerto Rican residents Miguel Reyes Pantojas and Joaquin Beltran
Robles.
   The latest indictments came after Hector Rivera Martinez and 15
other people were arrested in San Juan on Dec. 7. The FBI claims
Rivera Martinez headed the ring.
   According to the FBI, the suspects sold heroin to undercover
agents in July and August 1987. It did not specify the amount of
heroin allegedly involved.
   Conviction is punishable by from 10 years to life in prison and
fines up to $4 million, according to authorities.
   The indictments alleges that Rivera Martinez was involved in
drug trafficking in Puerto Rico since the 1960s. It says he hired
Tabbita and Pellerito to send heroin and cocaine from New York and
Florida to Puerto Rico for processing and distribution, and that
Rivera Martinez engaged in money laundering in Puerto Rico.
   After Rivera Martinez was arrested, authorities confiscated
property valued at $1.5 million and a 16-foot boat.

   Civil liberties and religious organizations
announced plans Friday for a radio, newspaper and telephone
campaign to combat fundamentalist preacher Jerry Falwell's assault
on a major civil rights bill facing a Senate vote Tuesday.
   ``Jerry Falwell is a liar, and the truth is not in him,'' said
the Rev. John H. Buchanan, chairman of People for the American Way,
the liberal lobbying group that is organizing the blitz with the
support of major Roman Catholic, Jewish and Protestant
organizations.
   Falwell, chairman of the conservative Moral Majority
organization, prompted a deluge of phone calls to senators' offices
_ reportedly 80,000 calls in a single hour on Thursday _ with his
charge that the bill ``is the greatest threat to religious freedom
and traditional moral values ever passed.''
   In a ``special memorandum to pastors'' circulated last week,
Falwell said the bill, which he called the ``Civil Rights Sodom and
Gomorrah Act,'' might force churches to ``hire a practicing active
homosexual drug addict with AIDS to be a teacher or youth pastor''
and allow the government to dictate sermons preached from the
pulpit.
   Buchanan, a Baptist pastor in Washington and former Republican
House member from Alabama, joined mainline religious leaders and
civil rights organizations at a news conference in denouncing
Falwell for ``spreading hysteria'' with ``scare tactics'' and
``obvious falsehoods'' about the bill.
   The measure, vetoed by President Reagan on Wednesday, was
approved earlier this year by margins of 75-14 in the Senate and
315-98 in the House, more than the two-third majorities necessary
to enact the legislation over Reagan's objections.
   The Senate is scheduled to vote Tuesday on overriding the
president's veto, and House action will follow. Approval by both
chambers is required to put a vetoed bill into law.
   Buchanan said that ``to help set the record straight,'' his
organization will place radio advertisements in major listening
areas over the weekend and will run newspaper ads in The Washington
Post and USA Today on Monday.
   In addition, he said, People for the American Way will spend the
weekend phoning its 270,000 members nationwide to urge them to
lobby members of Congress in support of the bill.
   The anti-Falwell ad campaign also will concentrate on newspapers
in Alabama, Florida, South Carolina and Louisiana, Buchanan said.
   The bill's foes, meanwhile, succeeded in persuading at least one
senator who had voted for the bill, John W. Warner, R-Va., to
change his mind.
   Warner said Friday he had decided to vote to sustain Reagan's
veto after his Senate office received ``thousands of calls from
Virginians questioning how the law will be implemented and how it
will impact their daily lives.''
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., who voted for the bill, said he also
would vote to sustain Reagan's veto, primarily because of the
bill's unfavorable impact on homebuilders, farmers and some
religious groups that the measure ``may encroach on separation
between church and state.''
   Cochran said Assistant Senate Minority Leader Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo., told him he also intended to defect. But Mary K. Hill, a
spokeswoman for Simpson, said Simpson had not decided which way he
would vote.
   The measure was intended to overturn the Supreme Court's 1984
Grove City decision, which restricted the scope of
anti-discrimination laws. The court said the laws cover only
specific programs receiving federal funds, rather than the entire
colleges, corporations or other institutions under which the
programs operate.
   Advocates of the vetoed bill say it merely would restore
institution-wide coverage that Congress intended when it passed
legislation banning discrimination against minorities, women, the
handicapped and the elderly in federally financed programs.
   In an attempt to avert a House and Senate override of his veto,
the president proposed an alternative that would narrow the scope
of the vetoed bill.
   Among the groups joining the campaign in support of the bill
were the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, American Jewish
Congress, U.S. Catholic Conference, American Jewish Committee,
Evangelical Luthern Church in America, American Baptist Churches
USA, United Methodist Church, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.),
Episcopal Church, Church of the Bretheran and the National Council
of the Churchs of Christ in the U.S.A.

<HEAD>Warming Climate May Cause Serious Drop In Water Levels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Water levels in the Great Lakes could drop as
much as seven feet in the next 100 years because of a warming
climate caused by man-made changes in the atmosphere, a federal
hydrologist said Friday.
   The forecast by Dr. Frank H. Quinn of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration came as the Great Lakes Commission at
its semi-annual meeting criticized lakes-research budget cuts
proposed by President Reagan.
   Quinn, speaking in Chicago, said precipitation over Lakes
Michigan and Huron since 1965 has exceeded the average for the 20th
century.
   The wet and cool climate of the past 20 years pushed the lakes
to record high levels and may have produced a new norm for the
lakes.
   ``However, this could be offset in the future by climate
warming, which would have the opposite effect on lake levels,''
Quinn said.
   Computer simulations, based on expectations for the
concentration of carbon dioxide and other chemicals in the
atmosphere, suggest the warming climate could lower Lake Michigan
and Lake Huron by three feet to seven feet in the next 100 years,
and Lake Erie by two feet to four feet, said Quinn, who heads
NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratories in Ann
Arbor, Mich.
   The simulations suggest an average temperature increase of seven
degrees over the Great Lakes Basin, Quinn said.
   In Washington, the Great Lakes Commission, an interstate
organization that coordinates policy on issues affecting the lakes,
released an analysis showing the Reagan administration's budget
would cut Great Lakes research funding nearly in half.
   The Reagan budget for 1989 proposed $17.1 million in Great Lakes
spending by the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of
Commerce and Department of the Interior, Martin said. Congress
approved $32.7 million in spending on the programs in 1988.

<TEXT>
   A former banker dying of AIDS has been charged
with embezzling $1.3 million and giving some of it to gay charities.
   A federal indictment, made public Thursday, accused William
Patrick Debenport, 27, of using his position as manager of a First
Texas Savings and Loan branch to misappropriate the money.
   If convicted on all 15 counts, Debenport could receive up to 75
years in prison and $75,000 in fines.
   Debenport's attorney, J. Stephen Cooper, said in November that
Debenport used the money to buy luxuries for himself and friends
but also donated some to gay charities, including $175,000 to a
Dallas home for AIDS victims.
   First Texas has sued to recover the money from the home.
   Debencourt was fired in June. Cooper said his client began
taking the money after being told by a doctor he had AIDS and had
only a short time to live.
   Cooper said Debenport donated a small amount to a predominantly
gay church and gave sums ranging from several hundred to several
thousand dollars to as many as 15 friends.
   He also bought himself a luxury car and a $217,000 home, Cooper
said.

<HEAD>Warning to Congress from Palau Lawmakers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven Palau lawmakers accused a House
subcommittee Friday of unreasonably delaying their country's
independence with unfounded and unproven charges of corruption and
narcotics trafficking.
   They warned that if the delay continues, the mid-Pacific island
chain will face a financial crisis and meanwhile might explore
``other political status alternatives'' than that already chosen,
free association with the United States.
   The seven Palau senators admitted that the islands had drug and
other problems. But they had been ``permitted to develop
unchecked'' during 40 years of U.S. rule, and could be attacked
more effectively now by the new sovereign government with financing
promised under the recently-approved compact with the United States.
   The Palau senators raised the issues in a letter to Ron de Lugo,
the Virgin Islands delegate, who is chairman of a House
subcommittee on insular and international affairs.
   The letter took issue with charges of Palau wrongdoing raised by
de Lugo and Rep. Morris K. Udall, D-Ariz., chairman of the House
Interior Committee, in a March 2 letter to the chairman of the
House Foreign Affairs committee, Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla.
   Udall and de Lugo said in their letter that Palau was used as a
transhipment point for heroin moving from Southeast Asia to the
United States and that several unnamed ``senior Palauan government
officials have been identified to us as being connected'' with the
traffic.
   Palau, the last Pacific territory still under U.S. trusteeship
since World War II, has entered into a compact of free association
with the United States, now awaiting implementation by Congress.
Other Senate and House committees have voted final approval but de
Lugo and Udall earlier this month held up action and raised the
charges against unnamed officials of the government in Koror,
capital of the new republic.
   They also cited violence last summer surrounding a plebescite
weakening Palau's constitutional ban on nuclear weapons to
accommodate the U.S. military, which counts on Palau as a backup
base if its forces are asked to leave the Philippines.
   Udall and de Lugo have said the resolution implementing the
compact won't be acted on until Palau's courts rule on the legality
of the plebescite approval, or opponents of it declare they won't
renew a court challenge they had said earlier they withdrew because
of intimidation.
   ``We urge that you do not permit the issue of alleged wrongdoing
in Palau to become tied to the approval of compact
implementation,'' the seven senators said in their letter.
   Palau, which has a population of less than 15,000 in its 200
islands, had repeatedly asked U.S. help against drug cultivation
and trafficking but its requests were rarely honored, the letter
said, asserting that subcommittee allegations of corruption and
criminal acts lacked documentation.
   Most of them ``are absolutely spurious and unfounded, and were
made by a small group of discontented Palauans under the influence
of unknown outside elements ...'' it continued.
   ``We also believe that certain government officials including
members of this National Congress have been fueling this concern
about irrelevant issues to further their individual political
ambitions,'' it said.

   The 70-year-old founder of the 1,150-mile
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race crossed the finish line Friday in
fifth place, more than a day and a half behind the winner but still
in the money.
   Joe Redington of Knik collected $15,000 as one of the top 20
finishers in the annual Anchorage-to-Nome trek. Herbie Nayokpuk of
Shishmaref was a minute and 16 seconds behind as they arrived
shortly after noon.
   For Redington, who organized the first Iditarod in 1973 but has
never won, it was the fifth time he has finished fifth. Nayokpuk
will collect $12,000 for the No. 6 spot.
   Susan Butcher won the race Wednesday night for the third time in
a row. She finished in 11 days, nearly 15 hours ahead of her
nearest rival, Rick Swenson of Two Rivers.
   Redington pumped hard over the final couple of miles as he and
Nayokpuk made their run along the Bering Sea ice.
   ``I really had to work,'' Redington said at the finish line.
   Forty one mushers continued on the trail Friday. Some were more
than four days from Nome. The race began March 5.

   President Jose Azcona Hoyo said he
was sending troops to rugged mountains near the Nicaraguan border
to oust Sandinista forces, and a White House source said U.S.
helicopter assistance was requested.
   Azcona said Friday that 2,000 troops had begun moving into the
Bocay jungle region on orders to drive out the Sandinistas, adding
that his government was preparing ``an operation to bomb inside
Honduran territory.''
   He told a news conference he was `counting on the support of the

   Torn and bloodstained from battle,
regimental flags that led Union soldiers into the breach at
Gettysburg and Antietam face a new fight against the ravages of
time, say museum curators trying to save them.
   Many of the 30 silk banners at the Civil War Museum and Library
here remain rolled around their poles, as they were at the end of
the Civil War in 1865, with little protection against aging.
   Some of the flags were wrapped with paper about 15 years ago to
preserve them, but acids in the paper apparently foiled that
effort. When several were gingerly unfurled last month for the
first time since then, some turned to dust or broke apart.
   ``To me they are sacred. ... They are symbols of the ultimate
sacrifice and love of country,'' said Andy Waskie, a member of the
Grand Army of the Republic, a group of descendants of Union
veterans which operates the museum.

   Only 1 percent of $20 million in ``emergency''
U.S. military aid sent to Honduras following a 1986 incursion of
Nicaraguan troops was used to respond to the attack, according to a
secret report by congressional investigators.
   The $200,000 spent to respond to the four-day Sandinista border
raid in late March 1986 was used to airlift Honduran troops to the
remote jungle in southeastern Honduras where the Nicaraguan forces
were attacking Contra rebel camps and to provide them with field
rations, according to the General Accounting Office.
   The remainder of the $20 million was used simply to speed up a
schedule of routine purchases for the Honduran military, most of
them aimed at modernizing the country's armed forces, the GAO found.

   On the flood-lit, greenery-bedecked platform stood the Roman
Catholic pope, his raised hands joined with those of U.S.
Protestant and Eastern Orthodox leaders as they intoned the Lord's
prayer together.
   ``Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name...''
   Out across Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, S.C., a sea of
65,000, mostly Southern Baptists and other Protestants, also lifted
clasped hands aloft, the prayer resonating in concert:
   ``Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in
Heaven ...''
   It was an unprecedented interlude, there in the overwhelmingly
Protestant South on Sept. 11, 1987, as Pope John Paul II led a
Billy Graham-style service, using Graham's advisers, pulpit and
sound equipment, in conjunction with the widest array of American
church officials ever assembled with a pope.
   ``We stand, side by side, to confess Jesus Christ, the one
mediator between God and man,'' he said, ticking off the varied
denominational leadership participating with him: Methodist,
Baptist, Lutheran, Pentecostal, Presbyterian, Reformed, Episcopal,
Catholic, Orthodox, Disciples of Christ and others.
   ``Brothers and sisters ... Let us rejoice in this fellowship.
And let us commit ourselves further to the great task which Jesus
himself urges upon us: to go forward along the path of Christian
reconciliation and unity.''
   That impulse for unity, germinating among divided churches after
centuries of conflict and antagonism, was implored by Jesus on the
night before his crucifixion.
   ``Father, the hour has come,'' he prayed in that dark, tearful
vigil on the Mount of Olives, pleading his followers ``may all be
one ... so that the world may believe.''
   That imperative, reiterated through the New Testament, was a
given for Christians _ that having one Lord, they were inherently
one community. Yet for centuries, they fragmented into hostile
camps, spurning and vilifying one another.
   ``Schismatic sects, apostates,'' Rome labeled Protestants, who
inveighed against Roman Catholicism, ``the Roman Babylon, popism,''
and vied caustically among themselves. Scattered pockets of that
rancor remain.
   However, in a sweeping and comparatively brief span of the 20th
century, the bitter enmity has largely vanished. The last 20 years
have witnessed broad inter-church friendship and collaboration.
   ``The whole atmosphere has changed,'' said religion historian
Harry S. Stout of Yale University, noting that in television
sermons it is generally impossible to tell a Catholic from a
Protestant.
   ``It's one of the most important trends of the 1980s and it's on
the rise,'' he said in an interview. ``Christians of different
denominations are coming together, recognizing a common enemy,
whether you call it atheism, materialism or secularism. Faced with
a common enemy, they're realizing that they need each other, that
they're in the same boat.''
   Congregations and pastors, once stiffly aloof and
uncommunicative, have become trusting, sharing retreats and working
together.
   For Christ ``is our peace, who has made us both one, and has
broken down the dividing wall of hostility,'' says Ephesians 2 of
differently descended believers. ``So then you are no longer
strangers and sojourners, but ... fellow ... members of the
household of God.''
   The contemporary change began in the century's first half as
Protestantism and eventually Eastern Orthodoxy joined in councils
and compacts, followed in the last 25 years by Catholicism's
transforming plunge into the convergent stream.
   It's called the ``ecumenical movement,'' meaning a global coming
together. Lately it has developed some uncharted currents beyond
official banks _ or anticipation.
   ``It has moved far beyond the tinkling of teacups and the
initial exuberance,'' said the Rev. Thaddeus Horgan, assistant
ecumenical officer of the U.S. Roman Catholic bishops. ``It has
become so common it's often unnoticed. It has moved from
adolescence into young adulthood.''
   But the most prominent characteristic of the movement recently
has been its growing power among the rank-and-file, creating an
utterly new companionship and teamwork among Protestants and Roman
Catholics.
   ``A tide is rising and soon it will be felt on the quarter
deck,'' said United Methodism's foremost theologian, Albert Outler
of Dallas.
   It's like a half-full glass, he said, which, instead of filling
from above, now is rising from the bottom. ``It's bubbling up in a
way that it can burst out in new forms.''
   Outler, among the pioneering Protestant observers at
Catholicism's reforming 1962-65 Second Vatican Council, which
unleashed the church's ecumenical involvement, added:
   ``Christians have discovered that they can live and work
together, with or without official sanction or what used to be
called organic unity. There's a sort of paralysis at the top, but a
very vigorous grass-roots development and exploration _ not only in
cooperative social action but in joint study, discussions and
sharing in church life _ while official leadership has settled down
into a kind of quiescence. ...
   ``It's beginning to be the case that Christian lay folk in
general no longer believe that structural tinkering has much real
impact for change, and they're turning to what may be more
authentic, doing it themselves.
   ``The younger generation is growing up in this atmosphere, and
denominational identities are being blurred. ... The new
developments can't be calendared or predicted ... but I think we're
actually moving more realistically in terms of basic essential
ventures of Christian unity than when we were so entranced by its
theatrics.''
   But the growing sense of community still has its dramatic
moments. Such was that juncture in the heavily Protestant territory
of Columbia, S.C., where the pope met in an unparalleled
interchange with the broadest cross-section ever of American
Protestant and Orthodox leadership, black and white, mainline,
evangelical and Pentecostal.
   The 26 church leaders, in a joint statement read by African
Methodist Episcopal Bishop Philip Cousins, said the ``prayers and
hopes of many American Christians'' were for further steps in
``reconciling the divided people of God.''
   Later, at the end of the vast stadium service, the pope and the
church leaders together raised their hands, pronouncing blessing on
the multitude in unison:
   ``The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make his face to
shine upon you, and be gracious to you. The Lord lift up his
countenance upon you and give you peace.''
   Across that Bible Belt city of Columbia, the church bells pealed.

   The second story in a four-part Easter series,
``Strangers No Longer,'' reports on efforts for Christian unity,
dealing with the quiet, seldom-noted ties among Roman Catholics and
Protestants in Bible scholarship and worship.

   In a gray stone building called Adams House at Princeton
University, 30 scholars pray, discuss their agenda and progress
reports, then divide in half and go to work in separate rooms.
   Each is stocked with reference books, reproductions of Hebrew
and Greek manuscripts, grammar books and biblical commentaries.
   The participants are Protestant, Roman Catholic, Eastern
Orthodox and Jewish experts on the Bible, and in the two sections _
Old Testament and New _ they are working on a revised translation.
   ``So far as this book is concerned, we're essentially at one,''
said the Rev. Bruce Metzger, a Presbyterian and head of a committee
working on a new Revised Standard Version, the Protestant-sponsored
Bible that also has Roman Catholic approval.
   ``Biblical scholars of Roman Catholic and Protestant affiliation
approach their work in terms of scholarship with little if any
differences remaining,'' Metzger said in an interview. ``The lines
of distinction have meted away.''
   That common treatment and usage of the Bible has become a
powerful undercurrent in their advance toward unity. Work on the
book is seen as the inner glue, acting from within to mend the
ruptures.
   ``Traditional differences are not relevant,'' said Catholic Old
Testament scholar Conrad L'Heureux of the University of Dayton.
``We have lots of debates, but they don't fall along denominational
lines. ... It's become second nature to get at what the text says
objectively without bringing the perspective of your own church
into it.
   ``In an odd sense, biblical scholars are ahead of the crowd.''
   ``It's a wave of the future,'' agreed Catholic Bible scholar
William Holladay of Andover-Newton Theological Seminary in
Massachusetts. ``It may well bring everybody else along.
Confessional differences may seem to divide people on Saturday and
Sunday, but they don't make any difference when it comes to
biblical work.''
   Besides the joint scholarly work, most American Christians hear
identically worded biblical passages each week in worship services.
   ``For the most part, they aren't aware of it,'' said the Rev.
Monsignor Alan Detscher of the U.S. Catholic Conference's liturgy
office in Washington, D.C. ``They generally experience only the
Scripture readings in their own church and aren't aware the
passages are now mostly identical that Sunday in other churches.''
   This synchronization of Scripture readings came about through a
widely used common lectionary, the three-year cycle of Bible
lessons read in church and based on the Roman lectionary developed
since the reforming 1962-65 Second Vatican Council.
   In most mainline denominations, Roman Catholic, Episcopal,
Lutheran, Presbyterian and United Methodist, ``the readings now are
generally the same and follow the same pattern,'' Detscher said.
   For instance, last weekend on Palm Sunday, March 27, marking
Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem a week before his arrest and
crucifixion, the epistle read in most Protestant and Catholic
congregations was Philippians 2:6-11, saying in part:
   He ``emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born
in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled
himself and became obedient unto death, even death on the cross.''
   Provisions are made for shorter or longer readings and for
alternative passages. The weekly pattern may get off schedule by a
week or two, longer in periods not linked to major Christian
seasons, and the simultaneous passages are not adhered to in
evangelical-style congregations.
   In many places, neighboring Protestant and Roman Catholic
pastors ``get together to prepare their homilies because common
Scripture materials are being used,'' Detscher said.
   Sharing the same texts on which to preach, they trade ideas for
sermons, something that also makes for intellectual
cross-pollination.
   The Rev. Roland Murphy of Washington, D.C., a Catholic Bible
scholar, said that people's ``hearing the word of God Sunday after
Sunday in the same readings, more or less, is creating a bond of
unity that didn't exist before.''
   Protestant and Catholic liturgies also have become increasingly
parallel structurally, so that a casual visitor cannot tell in most
respects whether he's at a Catholic, Episcopal or Lutheran service.
   ``People no longer feel uncomfortable going to one another's
churches,'' Detscher said. ``From total separation in worship we've
moved to a commonality in worship. Slowly but surely, we've come a
long ways toward unity. Now that we're beginning to pray the same
way, maybe we'll start believing that way.''
   Of course, the touchstone Catholic-Protestant barrier remains
officially in Holy Communion, the central act of worship in which
joint participation is so far barred. But even that sharing happens
occasionally, quietly.
   ``In places, it's taking place casually, although it's not
really kosher,'' said United Methodist theologian Albert Outler of
Dallas. ``All kinds of Protestants are at Roman Catholic altars,
and Catholics at Protestant altars. They're beginning to think of
ways to have pulpit and altar fellowship without the bureaucrats
bothering them.''
   However, one of the strongest approved links is common
appreciation for the Bible and study of it, something formerly
inhibited by Catholicism but now heartily encouraged.
   The transition came at the Second Vatican Council, which urged
general reading of the Bible, including translations produced in
cooperation with Protestants.
   Previously, ``reading or studying the Bible was regarded as a
Protestant characteristic,'' said a Catholic New Testament scholar,
the Rev. Raymond E. Brown, adding ``that picture has changed
dramatically.''
   Brown, who teaches at New York's interdenominational Union
Theological Seminary, said American Catholicism had ``moved from
scarcely mentioning the Bible to a situation where the Bible has
become a fundamental referent in Catholic theology, spirituality
and religious discussion.''
   The fresh, broad regard for the Bible prompted a mutual
searching of ecumenical origins, a refocus on roots, drawing
churches closer to that common ground.
   In academic circles, Catholics and Protestants commonly teach at
each other's schools and seminaries. Protestant and Catholic
scholars, now often members of the same professional organizations,
have become an interacting, underlying intellectual stratum that
nourishes the whole enterprise.
   ``Sometimes there is greater loyalty among those in professional
societies than to their own seminary or denomination,'' said Yale's
Paul Minear, a United Church of Christ Bible scholar. ``They're
building lines of communication that simply ignore denominational
identities.''
   He said Scripture scholars and theologians are ``much more
united than church hierarchies. It just shows that what preserves
the different denominations is a set of non-theological factors.
Historic conditions keep them apart institutionally.''
   With theological training becoming more similar, with Protestant
and Catholic worship and sermons more alike, with scholars working
together, it's ``going to make an enormous difference in the long
run in creating a sense of commonalty,'' said Lutheran theologian
George Lindbeck.
   Asked if this common undergrowth might eventually sprout into
full-scale Christian unity, he said:
   ``If the urge becomes stronger, then the similarities will make
it much easier. Things could take off very quickly. But it's likely
to require major external events, something to catalyze it.''

   The third installment of a four-part Easter
series, ``Strangers No Longer,'' concerns with the
Protestant-Catholic convergence toward unity, dealing with official
dialogues.

   From across Christianity's denominational spectrum, reactions to
a proposal for unity have poured into the headquarters of the World
Council of Churches in Geneva, Switzerland.
   ``The response has been tremendous,'' said the Rev. Gunther
Gassman, a Lutheran and director of the council's Faith and Order
Commission, an inclusive Protestant-Roman Catholic-Eastern Orthodox
unit that is compiling the appraisals.
   ``It's a unique thing in the history of the ecumenical
movement,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``Never has there
been so much interest and discussion of a church document
throughout the world.''
   Roman Catholic, Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations,
170 of them from around the globe, have sent official responses to
an agreement jointly produced by their thinkers on a reintegrated
faith.
   ``BEM,'' it's called, standing for the central aspects of
baptism, eucharist (celebrating the Lord's Supper) and ministry.
   Sometimes called the ``Lima Text,'' it was produced by a
commission of 120 theologians, Bible scholars, historians, clergy
and lay leaders at a meeting in Lima, Peru, in 1982.
   ``We have become increasingly aware of our unity in the body of
Christ,'' they said. ``Sadly divided churches have been enabled to
arrive at substantial theological agreements. We believe many
significant advances are now possible.''
   To that end, BEM circulated among the churches for five years,
translated into 35 languages. After pondering, the denominations
have now voiced their assessment, the broadest ever attained in an
ecumenical accord.
   ``It's a towering achievement,'' said the Rev. John Hotchkin,
ecumenical officer for U.S. Catholic bishops. ``It could serve to
put a new floor under the ecumenical movement. It's a very
important landmark.''
   The Vatican also appraised the document, generally commending
the results, but asked for further elaborations, especially on the
ministry.
   The responses are being distributed to the churches in six
volumes, with the last two still to be compiled. A summary will be
considered by the joint commission at a meeting in August 1989, and
any clarifications and adaptations will be taken care of before the
final document is presented to churches by 1991.
   ``Then it's up to them,'' Gassman said. ``Our strong hope is
that they act on it in the next 10 years, initiating some form of
eucharistic sharing. Many of them are ready to do so now.''
   BEM offers concordant beliefs about key functions of the church,
drawing on common biblical roots and Christianity's centuries prior
to the 1054 schism that separated Rome and Eastern Orthodoxy and
the 16th-century Protestant break from Rome.
   The document challenges present-day churches to affirm this
common, early core of faith. Baptism of infants as well as adults
is recognized, with precedents for each in practices of the early
church.
   Regarding the eucharist, the approach goes behind the medieval
Catholic doctrine of ``transubstantiation,'' upholding instead a
broader concept of Christ's ``real presence'' in celebration of the
Lord's Supper.
   On the ministry, BEM recommends a threefold tier of bishops,
presbyters and deacons. Most major churches have all three, but
usually refer to presbyters as pastors, priests or ministers. Some
Protestant bodies avoid the term bishop but have parallel
overseeing offices under other titles.
   The responses have been as varied as the denominations. The
Vatican's 40-page response wasn't as long as the Salvation Army's
70 pages, the longest. The shortest, a half page from the
Presbyterian Church of New Zealand, simply said fine, let's go with
it.
   ``We've made an enormous lot of progress in the churches'
acceptance of each other,'' said the Rev. John Deschner, a United
Methodist from Southern Methodist University's Perkins School of
Theology in Dallas, who chairs the World Council commission. ``A
trust has developed among Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox
churches that is beyond what we'd ever dared hope.
   ``BEM culminates the rising pleas for increased acts of mutual
recognition of members and ministry, a kind of unity of mutual
hospitality, welcoming each other in each other's denominational
context, acknowledging each other before God.''
   Paving the way for BEM has been a swelling profusion of
dialogues and surprising accords among the denominations.
   On national and international levels, the bilateral talks have
gone on 20 years between teams of Catholics with Lutherans, with
Methodists, with Anglicans, with Baptists, with Disciples, with
Eastern Orthodoxy, with Presbyterians, with Pentecostals, with
Evangelicals.
   At the same time, Protestant bodies have met with one another,
scrutinizing their respective views, seeking closer understanding
and concurrence.
   It has become a vast, interconfessional conversation, a constant
to-and-fro hum of inquiry, explanation, discovery and, often
surprisingly, consensus.
   The talks probe the tangle of mutual misconceptions, mistaken
impressions and caricatured images accumulated through centuries of
alienation from one another.
   They seek to clear up where each really stands. On many points,
it turns out to be together.
   For instance, Lutherans and Anglicans in separate dialogues with
Catholics determined they basically agreed on a key issue of the
16th-century Protestant Reformation that had divided them.
   Protestants emphasized ``justification by faith'' alone, that
salvation comes only through faith in Christ's forgiving grace, and
asserted that Rome claimed the church dispensed grace for earned
merit.
   But it turns out that arguments in the heat of old battle were
misconstrued on both sides. They now agree _ as the U.S.
Lutheran-Catholic team put it _ that ``our entire hope of
justification and salvation rests on Christ Jesus'' and his
forgiving grace.
   Similarly convergent views have been found about the papacy
itself, with Anglicans and Lutherans agreeing on the benefit of a
unifying center, a presiding bishop of a pastoral rather than
juridical kind, responsible to regular ecumenical councils.
   The deluge of dialogue reports have dealt with virtually all
basic issues of churchmanship _ spirituality, Scripture, apostolic
succession, conversion, worship, grace, authority, the Holy Spirit,
family, mixed marriages, salvation and papal primacy, usually with
degrees of agreement.
   ``So much is happening, there is so much development that it's
hard to keep up,'' said Catholic Brother Jeffrey Gros, who heads
the Faith and Order office of the U.S. National Council of Churches.
   In a book summarizing a score of such understandings, ``Growth
in Agreements,'' Lutheran scholar Harding Meyer and Reformed
scholar Lukas Vischer say the dialogues ``constantly point beyond
themselves,'' so the main aim no longer is ``just reaching of
consensus but translation ... into practice in the living
fellowship of the churches.''
   Many issues remain unsettled between Rome and Protestantism on
such issues as ordination of women, which Catholicism and Orthodoxy
forbid. But Anglicans and Catholics, in new talks, are discussing
it.
   Different shades of understanding, terminology and doctrinal
nuances also linger, as do conflicts on social issues such as
abortion and divorce, along with bureaucratic inertia.
   ``The ecumenical movement is a glacier,'' said Lutheran Bishop
Herbert W. Chilstrom, head of the newly unified Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America. ``It moves slowly, but it does move.''

   The fourth and final installment of an Easter
series, ``Strangers No Longer,'' focuses on grass-root activities
in Protestant-Catholic efforts toward Christian unity.

   In the little town of Beaverton, Ore., the Mission of the
Atonement has both Roman Catholic and Lutheran members. Across the
country at Holy Apostles' Church in Virginia Beach, Va., members
included Episcopalians and Catholics.
   ``We're one model of how the church can put itself back
together,'' the Rev. Ray Barton, Catholic co-pastor of Holy
Apostles', said in an interview. ``It's a harbinger of the future.''
   Added the Rev. Donald Gross, Holy Apostles' Episcopal co-pastor,
``It's a sign of how it might be possible for the two traditions to
live together, a sign of the church united.''
   The combined congregations, authorized by bishops on both sides,
worship together in opening services. Then they split in two, as
church rules now require, for their main liturgies, including Holy
Communion, using in weekly turns the sanctuaries or adjacent
fellowship halls.
   About everything else _ Sunday school, adult Christian
education, home study and social outreach _ is done together.
   ``It seems critical that the Christian church give an example to
the world of how to express our unity and yet respect our
diversity,'' said the Rev. Dale Jamtgaard, Lutheran co-pastor in
Beaverton.
   ``It may be a little like royalty getting hitched between
nations,'' said Beaverton's Catholic co-pastor, the Rev. Mathias
Tumulty. ``It's a way to get to know and understand each other
personally and care for each other. If it's possible here, maybe
it's possible elsewhere.''
   Such signs of the underlying bonds get a rousing display May
21-25 when an expected 3,000 Protestants, Evangelicals and
Catholics hold a national ``Gathering for Christians'' in
Arlington, Texas.
   It is to bring out that ``we are no longer strangers'' and to
``honor and proclaim Jesus Christ whose cross and resurrection
bring peace with God and humanity,'' said the Rev. Eileen Linder,
ecumenical officer of the National Council of Churches, which is
putting together the event.
   This inter-Christian linkage has grown dramatically, showing up
in myriad Protestant-Catholic covenants and compacts at national
and local levels.
   ``I'm always struck with the developments of the last two
years,'' said the Rev. John Hotchkin of Washington, D.C., the U.S.
Catholic bishops' ecumenical officer, ``the neighborhood
coalitions, the working together in programs for the elderly, for
people in need, recycling clothes, common feeding pantries, drug
counseling for young people, shelters for the homeless.
   ``There's not much about it in the press, and people don't sense
anything remarkable about it anymore, but it's really quite
striking.''
   The alliances take many forms. In Brooklyn, N.Y., churches
joined in a huge interfaith project to build 5,000 low-cost houses
for poor families. Called the Nehemiah Project after the
fifth-century prophet who rebuilt ravaged Jerusalem, churches have
pooled $15 million, with 1,000 houses already up.
   In Houston, about 200 congregations are involved in a citywide
AIDS education and care effort.
   ``In this crisis, denominationalism is just religious history,''
said the Rev. Earl Shelp, the Baptist co-coordinator of the program.
   Churches in Seattle outfit rooms for the homeless.
   Through the Center for Corporate Responsibility in New York, 19
Protestant denominations and 210 Catholic orders and dioceses use
their $10 billion in stock holdings to sway business practices for
social good.
   Leaders of 40 denominations are involved in the Religion
Alliance Against Pornography, with local units functioning around
the nation. Included are churches of the National Association of
Evangelicals, which generally shun ecumenical efforts.
   Catholics and Protestants have banded together in such groups as
Bread for the World, Witness for Peace, Clergy and Laity Concerned,
Interfaith Hunger Appeal, the American Bible Society and even an
organization for laughs, the Fellowship of Merry Christians.
   They've teamed up in civil rights causes, the farm crisis, the
sanctuary movement to shelter Central American refugees, backed one
another's declarations on the American economy and against nuclear
weaponry.
   Spiritually, the togetherness shows up with uninhibited fervor
among groups of charismatic Christians, 40,000 of whom met in New
Orleans Superdome last July, an ecumenical jamboree of prayer,
singing-in-tongues and arms-high praises to God.
   Local ``covenants'' have developed, with participants promising
to pray for each other, to share resources, retreats, studies and
facilities and work together in social betterment projects. More
than 100 such covenants are estimated functioning between Catholics
and Episcopal, Lutheran, United Methodist, Presbyterian and other
Protestant congregations.
   In Riverside and North Riverside, Ill., eight congregations _
two Roman Catholic, two Lutheran, two Presbyterian, one Episcopal
and one United Methodist _ are linked in a covenant, with an eye to
eventual unity.
   Covenants pairing two congregations, usually Catholic and
Episcopal or Lutheran but also involving others, have arisen around
the country _ in Kentucky, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New York,
Oregon, Rhode Island, Colorado and elsewhere.
   ``They keep popping up here and there,'' said Sister Ann Teresa
Nagy of the Graymoor Ecumenical Institute in Garrison, N.Y. ``As a
result of dialogues and meetings, they realize how close they are.
... They're learning how to live together, work together and be at
one.''
   In Wyandanch, N.Y., the parishes of Trinity Lutheran and Our
Lady of Miraculous Medal once asked the Vatican to permit
inter-communion, but were turned down ``for the time being.''
   Catholic and Episcopal dioceses have entered covenants in Kansas
City, Mo.; San Diego; Little Rock, Ark.; Seattle; Providence, R.I.;
Milwaukee and Chicago.
   In local communities, churches often ``are working together more
closely than they are with their national headquarters,'' says
veteran ecumenical theologian Paul Minear. ``Something is happening
there by way of real Christian unity that does not follow
traditional church lines.''
   Additionally, major mergers among Protestants are being
discussed or have occurred, two sealed in the 1980s reuniting
Northerners and Southerners in the Presbyterian Church (USA) in
1983 and merging three Lutheran branches into the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America at the start of 1988.
   Another gradually unifying process is at a decisive stage among
nine U.S. denominations.
   ``This year is a watershed for us,'' said the Rev. Gerald Moede,
general secretary of the Consultation on Church Union. Five of the
nine denominations will act on the plan in 1988 _ the Episcopal
Church, United Methodist Church, Presbyterian Church (USA), the
African Methodist Episcopal Church and the African Methodist
Episcopal Zion Church.
   The United Church of Christ and Christian Church (Disciples of
Christ) decide next year. The two others already have approved _
the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church and the International
Council of Community Churches.
   ``We're looking for a new common identity in which we'd be
related, yet preserve our diverse traditions,'' Moede said, noting
the ``covenanting'' plan would maintain present structures but
bring sharing in ministry and communion.
   ``The objective is not one huge institution,'' he said. ``One
thing we've learned is that not everything should be given up or
changed. The early church had great diversity, and we want to
preserve that diversity.''

<HEAD>Calm In Credit Markets Means Stable Interest Rates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond traders are frustrated and would-be
homeowners thrilled by the eerie calm that has overtaken the credit
markets during the past several weeks. For the first time in quite
a while, you can almost bank on interest rates.
   ``This has been one of the quietest periods I've ever seen,''
Elliott Platt, an economist at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Inc., said in describing recent trading for bonds, notes
and other debt-related products.
   ``If there was a word that could be milder than calm that would
be appropriate,'' added F. Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist
for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   In the Treasury market, trading has slowed substantially.
According to the Federal Reserve, the average daily dealer
transaction was around $90 billion in the week ending March 9, at
least $10 billion below the norm.
   Some economists say the flatness in the credit markets, which
set the trend for consumer and business rates, can be attributed to
conflicting economic signals. Others say the markets are just
taking a break after starting the year on a somewhat volatile note.
   Whatever the reasons, most predict that interest rates will
remain fairly stable, at least through the spring.
   ``From the consumer standpoint I think the fact that we've had
some stability has been reassuring. Volatility in recent years has
taken its toll on consumer confidence,'' said McCarthy, who
described as comfortable the current level of interest rates.
   The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond, the most-watched debt
security, has remained in a fairly narrow range since late January,
fluctuating around 8.5 percent _ the same level as the current
prime lending rate.
   Mortgage rates have inched their way downward so far this year
but have remained fairly level in recent weeks, too.
   The average rate charged by commercial lenders on a fixed-rate,
30-year mortgage has been just below 10 percent since early
February, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. The
rate on adjustable mortgages has hovered around 7.5 percent in
recent weeks, Freddie Mac said.
   Compared to a year ago, there isn't too much change. However,
rates are at least two percentage points lower now than they were
around the time when the stock market crashed last October.
   After the market plunged, the Fed eased its credit policies,
allowing interest rates to fall, to prevent the economy from
falling into a recession. Lately, some signs of economic growth
have surfaced, mingled with reports to the contrary.
   In light of the mixed signals, analysts say the Fed has
indicated it will maintain a fairly stable policy through the
spring.
   ``The government has intimated it was more concerned about high
inflation than a recession,'' said Elizabeth G. Reiners, assistant
director of money market reserach for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
``It looks like inflation is at a comfortable level.
   ``If you keep policy stable, you're looking at stable rates.''
   Among the benefactors of stable rates have been homebuyers and
those looking to refinance loans or borrow for other big purchases.
   Knowing that rates aren't likely to swing wildly ``means that
people have more freedom of choice about when to do their home
buying and moving,'' said Carol A. Stone, a senior economist at
Nomura Securities Inc.
   Corporations and municipalities looking to sell their bonds and
notes also have felt less pressured.
   ``If they're considering a deal it gives them a little more
leeway ... because the market isn't moving wildly,'' said Mrs.
Reiners.
   But the big losers, Mrs. Reiners said, have been bond traders,
who make their money on the ups and downs of the market and
investors looking for high-yielding securities.

<HEAD>Airlines Taking Bold Gamble With New Fare Hikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's airlines embarked on a big gamble
this past week.
   They hope their steeper fares and tighter restrictions on
discount tickets won't overly upset customers, who have come to
take for granted the cheap fares nurtured in recent years by the
cut-throat climate of the deregulated U.S. industry.
   Emboldened by robust passenger traffic in recent months, the big
airlines put through major fare increases several weeks before they
normally do _ jumping the gun on the peak travel season that starts
in April.
   The October stock market crash triggered fears that consumer
nervousness could cut sharply into air travel, but the major U.S.
carriers have posted an average increase in traffic of 7 percent to
8 percent since New Year's Day from the same period last year.
   Flush with those results, the airlines have increased their
first-class, economy and discount fares by 15 percent to 85
percent, depending on the destination. They also tightened
restrictions on their popular ``MaxSaver'' discount fares,
requiring that tickets be purchased seven days in advance instead
of two.
   Some discount tariffs were eliminated altogether. The changes
hit hard at consumers who have to fly on short notice, especially
business travelers.
   The fare increases amplified the upward trend in air fares that
has prevailed for the past four or five months.
   ``It would seem the airlines run a very real risk of going too
far,'' said Paul Schlesinger, an airline analyst for Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. ``Empty planes don't carry the
debt.''
   Other analysts agreed that the airlines, in their bold grab for
more revenue, could force themselves into a ``Catch 22'' situation
whereby the higher fares and restrictions scare too many potential
passengers away.
   If that happens, fares could come back down as quickly as they
went up. Since the domestic airline industry was deregulated in
1978, it has become an increasingly nimble ``quick-change'' artist
in responding to shifting market conditions.
   ``What you're really seeing is a marketing of airline travel the
way retailers market,'' said Robert Joedicke, who follows the
industry for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``Fare policy is going to
be a continual adjustment game.''
   Joedicke suggested that rounds of fare cuts are becoming as
common as ``white sales'' of linen and other items offered
regularly by department stores.
   This means that the latest increases in the cost of flying,
while steep, do not necessarily signal a move toward a full-fare
airline industry.
   Besides, skeptics noted, some of the recent rise in traffic
could be coming from passengers taking free trips on frequent-flier
travel bonuses and triple-mileage awards. An estimated 8 million
Americans are enrolled in frequent flier programs and may be
bumping paying passengers.
   Many major airlines, believing that the frequent-flier giveaways
have gotten out of control, have imposed restrictions on the plans
or are thinking of doing so.
   In fact, some of the recent push toward higher fares may be an
attempt to compensate for lost revenue from frequent fliers.
   ``The airlines take a negative risk with the triple mileage,''
said Andrew Geller, a transportation analyst for Provident National
Bank in Philadelphia. ``The question arises of who's got to pay for
it _ the normal-fare people?''
   All this does little to reassure the individual customer, who
has been hit with a near-doubling of fares to some destinations.
   ``It's created a problem for us,'' said David Perlman, president
of DMS Travel, a retail travel agency in midtown Manhattan. ``It
just creates havoc with everybody.''
   He noted, for example, that a one-way, unrestricted economy fare
from Newark, N.J., to Chicago jumped under the new changes from
$185 to $280. A first-class, round-trip ticket between New York and
Aspen, Colo., now costs a hefty $1,200, up from $800.
   Perlman said he has spent much of the past week explaining the
changes to bewildered customers.

   A 72-year-old rancher who said she was
forced into bankruptcy because the Farmers Home Administration
thought she was ``an old woman who should quit farming'' is suing
the government lender for $3 million.
   Beulah Jorgenson, who her attorney said has operated a ranch for
many years, claims in the lawsuit that FmHA denied her a $300,000
emergency loan in 1986.
   The Bowman County FmHA County Committee found her eligible for
the loan, but it was denied by County Supervisor Ronald Holtz,
according to the lawsuit.
   The suit, which names Holtz and the FmHA as defendants, said
Mrs. Jorgenson was forced to file under Chapter 12 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Act to reorganize her debts after foreclosure
proceedings began. Chapter 12 is a relatively new provision of the
act intended to help financially strapped farmers.
   Holtz told Mrs. Jorgenson she could not pay off the loan but he
``specifically declared to other persons that he was rejecting the
plaintiff's FmHA application because ... the plaintiff was an old
woman who should quit farming and ... and stop bothering FmHA,''
according to the lawsuit.
   Bob Zimmerman, chief of FmHA farm programs in North Dakota, said
Friday the agency had not seen a copy of the lawsuit, which accuses
Holtz and the FmHA of age and sex discrimination. The suit was
filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court.
   FmHA is the government's lender of last resort for farmers and
ranchers.
   Mrs. Jorgenson ranches on 3,000 acres near Bowman in
southwestern North Dakota with one hired man, said her attorney,
Rolf Sletten of Bismarck.
   ``Her husband is in a nursing home and has been for many years.
She has been running (the ranch) herself for many years,'' Sletten
said.
   Mrs. Jorgenson needed the emergency loan to pay off some
higher-interest loans she owed the Production Credit Association
and the Federal Land Bank, Sletten said. ``She hadn't had any loans
from the FmHA,'' he said.
   Holtz wrote Mrs. Jorgenson on April 4, 1986, telling her that
the loan was denied because Holtz believed she couldn't pay it back
and all her property was already mortgaged, according to court
documents.
   Mrs. Jorgenson is still ranching while her bankruptcy case is
pending, Sletten said Friday.

<HEAD>Recession Fears Thawing as Spring Begins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As winter gives way to spring on Wall Street,
investors' worries are much different from what just about anyone
imagined three months ago.
   Increasingly, fears of an impending recession are being quelled
by signs of persistent strength in the economy. The stock market,
after suffering what looked like a knockout blow in October, has
bounced back with an impressive show of vitality.
   So the pessimists have turned to worrying not about hard times,
but rather too much of a good thing.
   Consider the position of the Federal Reserve. In the midst of
the crash last fall, it stepped up with a promise to provide as
much money to the system as was necessary to keep it from suffering
grave damage.
   Now, Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, is sounding warnings
about the possibility that growth at too strong a pace could revive
inflationary pressures.
   The trade deficit, a primary focus of concern last fall, has
improved to the extent that some people now interpret it as a
signal of an economy heating up to potentially dangerous
temperatures.
   The bond market has grown increasingly jumpy lately over much
better-than-expected growth in employment, for fear that it might
soon exert upward pressure on inflation and interest rates.
   All this has a familiar ring. It was the kind of mood that often
set in during the great bull market of 1982-87.
   In the bond market memories remain fresh of the wrenching rise
in interest rates, and accompanying drop in bond prices, that
started right about this time a year ago.
   ``The stock market is approaching a critical juncture,'' says
Joseph Barthel, an analyst at Butcher & Singer Inc. ``Bonds must
rally to ward off a correction, or worse.''
   All this suits many of Wall Street's bulls just fine. Stocks
seem to be ``climbing a wall of worry,'' in the time-honored phrase
used to describe bull markets.
   In the past week, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained
52.39 points to 2,087.37, reaching new highs since the October
debacle.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.20 to 152.65;
the American Stock Exchange market value index was up 3.02 at
299.11, and the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market added 6.10 to 381.58.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 175.26 million shares a day,
against 199.77 million the week before.
   In the view of Mitchell Held, chief financial economist at Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co., ``the Fed is likely to hold policy
steady for the time being, and consequently we expect to see little
movement in short-term rates for now.
   ``Should the economic data continue to exceed general
expectations, as we anticipate, inflation expectations are likely
to rise, and short-term rates will probably rise either in reaction
to or in anticipation of Fed action.''
   However, if inflation is planning a comeback it is disguising
its intentions pretty well. The producer price index of finished
goods fell 0.2 percent in February.
   ``Consumers seem to have found a degree of price consciousness
and budget discipline,'' said David Ressler, chief economist at
Nomura Securities International.
   ``They seem willing to increase purchases of certain items such
as a car when there are significant price discounts, but to balance
that added spending with more restraint on other items.
   ``Such price sensitivity will make it difficult for any
broadbased cost pressures to be passed on to consumers.''

<HEAD>Analysts Downgrade Digital Third-Quarter Earnings Estimates</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 5th graf with closing stock price.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. said Friday that sluggish
sales of expensive computer systems have forced analysts to
downgrade third-quarter earnings estimates for the computer
industry giant.
   Mark Steinkrauss, Digital's investor relations director, said
the company is forecasting lower earnings for the fiscal quarter
ending March 26 because of the lag.
   ``While aggregate demand is very good and consistent with the
level we expected in the last couple of years, there's been a mix
shift to low-end products,'' he said.
   After discussions with analysts, Digital, based in Maynard,
Mass., agreed to cut its quarterly earnings forecast to about $2.30
a share from $2.50 a share. The company earlier this month agreed
to cut forecast to $2.50 from $2.70.
   Digital stock fell $1.50 a share Friday to $110.75 in composite
New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock fell $5.375 on Thursday.
   Wang Laboratories, Prime Computer and Data General all have
indicated recently that business is sluggish due to slumping
high-end demand, confirming a trend in minicomputer sales, analysts
said.
   ``Things are generally somewhat slow in the minicomputer sector
right now,'' said Bruce Watts of Needham & Co. ``Digital has been
reasonably candid that its product mix has shifted to less
expensive machines.''
   Steinkrauss said Digital has been unable to meet an unexpectedly
high demand for its less expensive equipment, including
workstations and terminals.
   ``The unanticipated shift caught us a little bit by surprise,''
he said. ``We didn't know demand was going to be as strong for
workstations and products at the low end and we didn't have the
capacity to ship it all this quarter.''
   Digital last week unveiled its 8800 Series of mainframe
computers in another challenge to industry leader International
Business Machines. But analysts said the impact of the new line
won't be felt for several months.
   ``The sales of high-end equipment are going slowly,'' said Jean
Orr of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``Customers are apparently
hesitant to make a commitment to the expensive equipment.
   ``We don't know for certain how long the hesitation will last,''
she added. ``My view is that it's going to be a quarter or two that
we see an effect.''
   Watts said Digital stock probably will fall some more in the
short-term but that its long-range prospects remain bright.
   ``I think there's no question that DEC has established
themselves as the leader in the minicomputer business and is
starting to take on IBM in the big computers, he said.
   Analysts also have dropped Digital's yearly earnings estimates
to $10 to $10.25 a share compared with $10.50 a share earlier this
month. For fiscal 1987, Digital reported profits of $1.14 billion
on $9.39 billion in revenues, or $8.53 a share.

<HEAD>Kaiser Steel Files Bankrutpcy Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FONTANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kaiser Steel Corp., operating under
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings for 13 months, said Friday a
joint plan of reoganization had been filed by Kaiser and
representatives of retirees, other unsecured creditors and the
United Steelworks of America.
   Under the plan, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Colorado on
Thursday, a percentage of proceeds from the sale of assets and the
settlement of litigation will be distributed to creditors.
   In addition, some claims against the company will be converted
into common stock in the reorganized concern, to be known as Kaiser
Holdings Inc.
   The plan provides, in part, for 30 milion common shares of the
new company to be distributed to retirees, Kaiser's unsecured
creditors, holders of preferred stock and, at the discretion of the
new board, as incentive options to management.
   Kaiser's current common stock, which is privately held, will be
canceled.
   The plan is endorsed by Kaiser and certain of its subsidiaries
as debtors; the company's official unsecured creditors committee;
that committee's retiree subcommittee, and the union.
   Upon emerging from bankruptcy proceedings, Kaiser said, it
intends to develop its 900-acre steel mill in Fontana as an
industrial park, modernize and operate its existing liquid-waste
treatment facility at the Fontana site and seek to create a
landfill for non-hazardous solid waste at its Eagle Mountain iron
ore mine in Riverside County.
   Although most of its holdings remain in Fontana, the company's
headquarters were moved to Colorado Springs, Colo., after a
leveraged buyout of several years ago.
   The Fontana plant was built by industrialist Henry J. Kaiser
during World War II to provide steel to build Liberty Ships on the
West Coast.
   The plant was located about 50 miles inland to protect it from
possible enemy attack during the war. But that location proved
fatal to the operation in later years, as high transporation costs
made it impossible for steel from Fontana to compete with low-cost
imports.

<HEAD>Judge Delays Ruling on Resorts Bid; Trump Sues Griffin</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 5th graf with closing stock price.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Delaware judge declined Friday to approve a
settlement of shareholder suits against Resorts International Inc.
that would have allowed investor Donald Trump to proceed with his
$22-per-share tender offer designed to take Resorts private.
   Instead, Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Maurice Hartnett put off
a decision until later, following a 2{-hour hearing.
   The action increases pressure on Trump, the New York real estate
developer, to raise his offer by giving wealthy entertainer Merv
Griffin more time to press his rival $35-per-share cash bid for
Resorts, the Atlantic City-based operator of hotel-casinos in New
Jersey and the Bahamas.
   ``Every continuance is a good thing for us in this situation
currently,'' said Mark Gill, a spokesman for Griffin, noting that
Trump's $22 offer expires on Monday.
   Resorts stock rose 50 cents a share Friday to $25.75.
   While Griffin's bid offers shareholders more money, it is
contingent on a number of conditions, including a decision by Trump
to support the deal and to terminate a five-year operating pact
with Resorts worth an estimated $100 million.
   Trump, who holds 88 percent of Resorts' voting power by owning
most of its Class B stock that carries 100 votes per share, has
said he wouldn't agree to either condition. As a result, Resorts'
directors Thursday declined to pursue Griffin's proposal on grounds
that it was moot.
   In separate developments Friday, Griffin, based in Los Angeles,
said he was dropping certain other conditions relating to
financing, and Trump announced he had filed suit against Griffin
seeking more than $250 million in damages.
   Trump's suit, filed in U.S. District Court in New York, names as
defendants Griffin, his privately held investment concern, The
Griffin Co., and Fidelle V. Scutti, who owns about 5 percent of
Resorts stock.
   Scutti, who has said he is dissatisfied with Trump's offer,
helped convince Griffin to make the competing bid.
   Trump's suit accuses the defendants with violations of federal
securities laws, fraud and tortious interference with Trump's
contractual relations with Resorts
   It claims the defendants took part in a scheme to manipulate the
market price of Resorts stock by making false and misleading
comments about their intentions and by making a $35-per-share offer
that the suit said was ``completely delusory'' because of its
highly conditional nature.
   In a statement, Griffin termed Trump's suit ``totally without
merit and solely for the purpose of attempting to coerce Mr.
Griffin to withdraw his offer.''
   Griffin said the suit of ``of no concern'' and that he intended
to filed unspecified counter-suits against Trump.
   Griffin has previously said he expected to file suit against
Trump and directors of Resorts for breach of fiduciary duty to
shareholders.
   The conditions Griffin eliminated from his offer were
requirements that financing be arranged for the merger and that
financing be arranged in advance to complete Resorts' giant and
luxurious Taj Mahal, a 42-story, 1,250-room hotel-casino being
built in Atlantic City.

   Postal Instant Press Inc., the nation's
largest franchiser of printing centers, said Friday a
management-led offer to buy the company has expired and it is
negotiating to be acquired by another suitor for a higher price.
   The company said it received the new offer of $17.50 per share,
or $68.25 million, on Wednesday from an investor group that it
didn't identify.
   That is 50 cents a share higher than what was being offered by
the management group and the Chicago-based leveraged-buyout concern
Golder, Thoma & Cressey. The management group made its offer Feb.
19.
   In addition, PIP said the new suitor has indicated it may raise
its offer after studying non-public information provided by the Los
Angeles-based company that has about 1,000 printing centers
franchised in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.
   Last year, PIP escaped a hostile bid by Tarrytown, N.Y.-based
Kane-Miller Corp.

<TEXT>
   An investor group led by the chairman of
AFG Industries Inc. Friday revised its takeover bid for AFG to
offer all cash instead of a combination of cash and securities. The
overall value of the offered remained the same at $940 million.
   AFG, based in Irvine, is one of the largest flat-glass
manufacturers in North America.
   Under the amended offer, Clarity Industries Corp., headed by AFG
Chairman R.D. Hubbard, is offering $33 per share in cash for AFG's
28.5 million shares. Previously, Clarity had offered cash for 94
percent of the stock and preferred stock valued at $33 per share
for the remainder.
   The revised offer is to expire April 1.
   Clarity launched its takeover bid late last month. It was
upstaged early this month when the New York investment firm
Forstmann Little & Co. indicated it may be willing to top Hubbard's
offer.
   That sparked speculation that drove AFG's stock up, but a week
ago Forstmann said it had decided not to make an offer after
studying confidential information provided by AFG.

   Hewlett-Packard on Friday disputed Apple's claims and said it
intends to oppose the suit vigorously. Microsoft withheld comment.
   Several computer executives expressed disappointment with
Apple's suit.
   ``The whole industry has existed by taking what is there and
improving on it,'' Adam Osborne, president of Paperback Software of
Berkeley. ``Is that going to end? If so, it'll be a disaster for us
all.''
   In the suit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose on
Thursday, Apple seeks to prevent further sale of Microsoft's
Windows 2.03 program and Hewlett-Packard's New Wave software
programs.
   Windows and New Wave were developed for personal computers made
by or compatible with those of International Business Machines
Corp., Apple's chief competitor, and are aimed at making the
computers easier to use.
   Like the Macintosh, they employ a mouse pointing-device, and
such on-screen displays as icons, scroll bars, pull-down menus, and
dialogue boxes. These features replaced more complicated
instructions, and made the Macintosh one of the easiest computers
to use.
   Apple's chief operating officer, Delbert Yocam, said the company
merely is protecting its investment.
   The suit could affect Apple rival IBM, whose audio and visual
features, called the ``user interface,'' for its new line of
computers is expected to resemble the Macintosh's. The program,
called Presentation Manager, is being co-developed by IBM and
Microsoft.
   Industry observers credit the Macintosh interface with giving
the computer a competitive edge over IBM's current line.
Presentation Manager could eliminate that advantage.
   In its complaint, Apple alleges Microsoft overstepped the bounds
of a licensing agreement it made with Apple several years ago.
Hewlett-Packard's New Wave, in turn, requires Microsoft's Windows
to operate.
   Apple has sued before to protect its products. In 1982, the
company challenged Franklin Computer Corp., which was developing a
compatible version of its Apple II, and won.
   Apple also has prevented the import of Apple II clones by Asian
companies through legal challenges and cooperation with U.S.
Customs.

   Campeau Corp. has suffered a severe setback in
its battle for Federated Department Stores Inc. with a federal
judge's ruling that Federated's ``poison pill'' takeover defense
could stand.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand, who issued his ruling Friday,
at the same time delayed a decision on when Campeau's $6.2 billion
cash tender offer for Federated should be allowed to expire.
   Sand denied a request from R.H. Macy & Co. Inc. to force
Campeau's offer to remain open until March 30, but he ruled the bid
must remain in effect at least until next Friday.
   Federated's management supports Macy's cash and securities
offer, which analysts have valued at about $6.3 billion.
   The poison pill was seen as the key issue before Sand and the
issue that could ultimately determine who would win Federated.
Campeau contended its offer could not proceed as long as the pill
remained in effect.
   Federated's pill would allow current shareholders to buy more of
the company's stock at a steep discount unless the board of
directors withdrew the provision. Poison pills make it
prohibitively expensive for companies to acquire a target company
without the support of the target's management.
   Sand disagreed with Campeau's contention that Federated's board
of directors had breached its duty to shareholders in creating the
pill in 1986, or in amending it earlier this year, prior to the
Toronto-based developer's bid.
   Campeau contended the pill prevented shareholders from getting
the chance to fully consider its offer, but Sand said the creation
of the pill was a valid defense and a reasonable business judgment
by the Federated board.
   However, while the judge denied Campeau's motion for a
preliminary injunction, Sand left open the possibility that the
developer could raise the issue again.
   Campeau said it had no immediate comment on Sand's ruling.
   Sand, relying on a Securities and Exchange Commission
recommendation, ruled against Macy in declaring that Campeau's
latest bid, announced March 2, was an amendment to its original
proposal, and not a new offer.
   Macy had sought the bid to be declared a new offer in hopes of
forcing it to remain open for 20 business days, as required by law.
   Extending the length of Campeau's offer would put the competing
bids on on a more equal footing. Macy, whose offer expires April 4,
feared Federated shareholders would feel pressured into tendering
their shares to the developer because of the earlier deadline.
   Campeau's latest offer changed the number of shares it was
seeking and the price to be paid for them.
   Sand ruled, however, that the Campeau bid must remain open while
he awaited a determination from the SEC on whether the developer
must file more documents on its financing for the acquisition.
   Macy is offering $77.35 a share in cash for 70.43 million
Federated shares, for a total of $5.4 billion. Macy would exchange
shares in the merged company, Macy's-Federated Inc., and issue
convertible debt securities for the remainder of Federated's 89.5
million outstanding shares. Analysts have estimated the total value
of the offer at $6.3 billion.
   Federated stock rose 50 cents a share to close at $66.25 Friday
on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading ended before Sand made the
ruling.
   Campeau's bid is a two-step, all-cash package that would be
worth $68 a share, or $6.18 billion. It is offering $75 each for
70.5 million Federated shares, and proposes to acquire the
remaining stock for $44 cash per share in a subsequent merger.
   Campeau announced Friday that more than 5.7 million shares had
been tendered under its offer so far. Macy has not announced how
many shares have been tendered to it.
   Federated owns 650 stores, including the Bloomingdale's,
Burdine's, Filene's, Foley's, Lazarus and Rich's department store
chains; Ralphs supermarkets; Gold Circle discount stores; and Main
Street and Children's Place specialty stores.
   Macy owns nearly 100 department and specialty stores.
   Campeau, which started in real estate development in Canada,
moved into the U.S. retail market at the end of 1986 by acquiring
Allied Stores Corp.

   The oil market has continued to gain ground
despite conflicting reports on whether OPEC would act soon to
stabilize sagging prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for April
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,
jumped 30 cents Friday to $16.58 per 42-gallon barrel.
   Refined petroleum products also closed higher. April contracts
for heating oil increased 0.83 cent to settle at 45.05 cents per
gallon, while wholesale gasoline gained 0.39 cent to settle at
45.99 cents per gallon.
   William Byers, an oil analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co., said the
market started out on a strong note.
   But he said trading began to narrow later in the day after
reports suggested a planned news conference Tuesday by OPEC
President Rilwanu Lukman was not called to announce price
stabilization measures.
   Oil prices had strengthend on Thursday after traders learned of
the Lukman conference.
   The market has traded nervously since reports picked up last
week that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might
convene an emergency meeting to discuss ways to prop up sagging
prices.

   The Postal Service has been doing it practically
forever, but private sector companies are likely to think twice if
they ever have an opportunity to bid on moving mountains of the
nation's correspondence and parcels.
   Now that a presidential commission has recommended the Postal
Service's monopoly on delivering letters should be phased out,
private companies may begin to contemplate whether they would want
to compete for the business.
   In a controversial report presented to President Reagan on
Friday, the Presidential Commission on Privatization called for
transferring to the private sector scores of other government
programs and services, including the operation of prisons and
airport control towers, in the name of efficiency.
   As far as the nation's mail is concerned, ``there's nothing the
Postal Service is doing that private enterprise couldn't do equally
as well or better,'' said Ken Sternad, a spokesman at the
headquarters of United Parcel Service Inc. in Greenwich, Conn.
   Sternad said United Parcel, which maintains 1,300 facilities
across the country, had not made any decision about trying to get
into the letter-carrying business, ``but we certainly would look at
it.''
   But James Coleman, director of public relations at Federal
Express Corp.'s headquarters in Memphis, Tenn., said: ``We do not
view ourselves as having any role to play in routine handling of
bulk shipments.''
   Federal Express specializes in overnight and express deliveries,
a small piece of what the post office does.
   Taking on the postal system would require a major build-up for
any company. United Parcel, for example, has 200,000 employees who
delivered 2.4 billion packages last year. The Postal Service, by
comparison, has almost five times as many employees and delivered
more than 100 billion pieces of mail in 1987, Sternad said.
   If the government were to privatize merely the right to deliver
mail, potential bidders would be limited to companies that are
already in the post office-like business, said James Voytko, a
first vice president at the investment firm PaineWebber Inc. who
follows the transportation industry.
   But other big companies in unrelated businesses also might
qualify if they had a particularly extensive transportation network
set up.
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co., for example, operates a
major, nationwide fleet of trucks.
   ``They go to a lot of addresses fixing phones,'' said one
industry insider who asked not to be quoted by name. ``There are a
lot of companies that reach a lot of people _ the sky's the limit.''
   The bidding also could widen if the government decided to sell
the post office's assets, such as its trucks and properties, and
transfer the work force to the new owner.
   ``In that case, anybody with money could buy it,'' Voytko said,
although he noted that a company with experience in mail and parcel
delivery probably would feel more comfortable in the expanded
business.
   Voytko said, however, that it was uncertain whether operating a
nationwide postal service would be a good business opportunity.
   ``But it is good from a public policy point of view. The private
sector has proved time and time again that it can deliver services
better than the government,'' he said.
   Already the recommendations generated sharp advance opposition
from public employee and postal worker unions.
   The National Association of Letter Carriers said ending the
Postal Service monopoly on first- and third-class mail delivery
would destroy the nation's system of universal service. ``Rural and
inner-city residents would not be served ... or would receive
reduced service at exorbitant postal rates,'' the union said.
   However, David Linowes, a Democrat who headed the privatization
committee, said the government could require private companies to
deliver mail to all areas at the same price.
