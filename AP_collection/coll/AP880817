   Gov. Michael Dukakis had 49 percent to 46
percent for Vice President George Bush in a Washington Post poll in
Thursday's editions, a dead heat given the imprecision of public
opinion polling.
   It was the third poll released since Friday to find a
statistical tie in the presidential race, following a string of
earlier polls that found the contest tightening from Dukakis' big
post-Democratic convention lead.
   One poll, conducted by ABC News on Sunday, ran counter to the
trend of a tightening race, finding a 15-point Dukakis lead. It had
a small sample, 383 likely registered voters, and a six-point
margin of error.
   The new Washington Post poll was conducted from July 11 through
Tuesday among 1,119 likely voters nationwide, and had a margin of
error of plus or minus three percentage points.
   The day it was completed was the day Bush selected Sen. Dan
Quayle of Indiana as his running mate.

   Coretta Scott King attended the Republican
National Convention Tuesday night, getting a kiss from Barbara Bush
and listening raptly to New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean's keynote
address.
   The widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. sat in the vice
president's box in the Louisiana Superdome and was one of the first
people Mrs. Bush greeted when she made her entrance.
   Mrs. King also stopped by the Georgia delegation on the floor of
the Superdome. She left after Kean spoke and before Pat Robertson
began his talk.
   Another civil rights leader, the Rev. Benjamin Hooks, the
longtime executive director of the NAACP, delivered the closing
benediction Tuesday.
   Hooks called Kean's address ``a great speech ... one of the best
speeches I've heard in the 12 conventions I've attended. I enjoyed
it very much.''

<TEXT>
   A radio station offered a $1
million reward for proof Elvis Presley is still alive, on the 11th
anniversary of his death Tuesday, but only impersonators and fans
of the King showed.
   ``How many believe Elvis is still alive?'' asked KRLA radio disc
jockey Charlie Tuna as the crowd gathered outside a local diner, Ed
Debevics, which serves up burgers and malts in '50s tradition.
   He was greeted by applause and cheers from about 150 of the late
rock 'n' roll great's fans, but the only Elvis present was
impersonator Paul Boland, 27, of San Pedro, who arrived wearing a
white pantsuit with red and gold spangles.
   A waiter with a pompadour hairdo and shaking maracacas also
appeared.
   Tuna said the event was inspired by Gail Brewer Giorgio's recent
book ``Is Elvis Alive?,'' which disputes that the entertainer died
of heart disease Aug. 16, 1977.
   ``So we decided $1 million might put an end to all the
speculation,'' he said. The reward would be exchanged for seven
days' worth of exclusive interviews for the station, he said.
   Sue Wiegger, president of the Los Angeles chapter of a national
Elvis fan club, said she doesn't believe Presley is still alive.
   ``I just believe that woman is making money at the expense of
other people's feelings,'' she said of Ms. Giorgio, adding Elvis
fans ``have had a hard time dealing with the death.''
   ``His spirit's here and will always be here,'' said fan Gail
Herrington of suburban Valencia.
   In Presley's hometown of Memphis, Tenn. on Tuesday, fans lined
up to pay their respects at the singer's grave. More than 70 stands
of flowers, many shaped like guitars or hearts, lined the walk to
Presley's grave.
   ``This is the next best thing we're going to get to seeing
Elvis,'' said Graham Knowles, an Elvis fan who traveled from Leeds,
England, to Memphis.

<DATELINE>PERQUIN, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the army's two best
battalions has occupied this mountain town in the heart of
guerrilla country and its men patrol the heights and valleys as a
challenge to the rebels.
   Nearly 700 men of the Arce Infantry Battalion were brought in
July 26, by helicopter because truck transport from their garrison
35 miles to the south is considered too risky.
   Soldiers of the Arce, and those of the Atlacatl battalion, are
considered the army's most seasoned and efficient fighters.
   The operation is the biggest of the past year around the town in
Morazan province 125 miles northeast of San Salvador.
   It is directed by a colonel, in line to become armed forces
commander, who combines battlefield offensives with political and
social action designed to undermine peasant support for the
guerrillas.
   Leftist rebels have fought U.S.-backed Salvadoran governments
since late 1979 in a civil war that has killed an estimated 65,000
people, most of them civilians.
   Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, eastern military zone commander and
director of the Perquin campaign, said about 1,000 guerrillas
operate within a 20-mile radius of the town. He called that the
densest concentration of rebel fighters in El Salvador, a nation of
5.5 million about the size of Massachussetts.
   It is an area of forested mountains and jungled hollows
alternately baked by tropical sun and lashed by rainy-season
storms. Venceremos, the clandestine rebel radio, broadcasts from
northern Morazan.
   Ponce and Lt. Col. Reynaldo Chavarria, the theater commander
stationed in Perquin, believe most of the rebels have retreated
northward to, or across, the border with an isolated area of
Honduras where they sometimes take refuge.
   A 15-mile patrol with Arce troopers over two days revealed ample
evidence of rebel presence, including mine fields, communication
lines and two brief skirmishes.
   Ponce and Chavarria say the guerrillas have taken surprisingly
little offensive action against the incursion into the heart of
``liberated territory.''
   They said that indicates weakness because the Arce patrols are
somewhat exposed and would seem to be attractive targets.
   ``As we kill off their seasoned fighters, they are more and more
dependent on young, ill-trained recruits, kids,'' Chavarria said.
   He spoke on the stoop of his command post, an abandoned house on
the north side of a town square lined with facades pocked by
bullets and mortar shells.
   Directly across the square was a green house where guerrilla
commander Joaquin Villalobos, the most wanted man in El Salvador,
and his top officers held a news conference in March.
   Lieutenants, non-commissioned officers and troopers who man the
patrols are not convinced of guerrilla weakness. The soldiers are
tough, with high morale, but their nervousness and caution revealed
a sense that attack always was imminent.
   ``I've got the jitters,'' Lt. Ali Valdez whispered as the men
pitched camp silently in the dark on Torola Hill at the end of a
day's march.
   ``This is very hostile country. We know it well, but los babosos
(a disparaging term for the guerrillas) live here and know every
square meter of it.''
   The battalion lost two killed and 12 wounded in the first two
weeks, most of them from from mines or snipers. No guerrilla deaths
were confirmed.
   A Radio Venceremos broadcast Aug. 3 said: ``The Arce will have
to leave eventually, because they can't stay in Perquin forever.''
   No one argues with that. Ponce says his men will stay ``as long
as circumstances permit.''
   Government forces have occupied Perquin several times during the
war but never for more than 10 weeks.
   Chavarria and his officers said they think in terms of a month
this time, which puts limitations on Ponce's attempt to win the
area's approximately 800 peasants away from the rebel cause.
   ``People will be reluctant to listen to us and collaborate as
long as they know that in a month we'll be gone and the subversives
will be back,'' Chavarria said.
   Earlier this month, Ponce took reporters by helicopter to
Perquin for two hours, then to a town in neighboring San Miguel
province where he and his men distributed food and medicine. They
listened to requests from residents for a well, fertilizer and a
bridge over a nearby river.
   He says the San Miguel area has become less of a guerrilla
bastion because of attention to the people's needs and wants.
   ``We hurt the subversives much more by taking away their base of
support than by killing them,'' the colonel said.
   Ponce said he plans such work in Perquin but it is difficult
because years of war have made the people unresponsive.
   The town's cobbled streets were nearly empty of civilians during
the first week of the battalion's presence, Chavarria said, but
activity later returned to a semblance of normal.
   During a reporter's visit, children played soccer in a clearing
off the square and about 20 people gathered for the slaughter of a
young bull, waiting to buy some of the meat.
   Pablo Argueta, a 45-year-old peasant with eight children, killed
and butchered the animal.
   ``We're caught in the middle,'' he said. ``We don't want
problems with either side. We just want the war to end so we can
work in peace.''

<HEAD>South Koreans Criticize Violent Radical Students</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radical students staging
anti-government protests have been criticized, heckled and even
attacked in recent days by furious citizens demanding an end to
violent clashes in their communities.
   Such public anger toward the radicals, who represent about 10
percent of South Korea's students, is rarely seen in a nation that
has been generally tolerant of student activism. It has shocked the
students, who see themselves as fighting on behalf of the very
people criticizing them.
   The rising resentment appears to reflect both anger over the
radicals' violent tactics and concern for the Olympics, which start
in Seoul on Sept. 17.
   South Koreans are worried that violent protests at the moment
when world attention is focused on Seoul could ruin the nation's
image. Most people see the Games as a coming of age, and they want
to impress the world with a major success.
   Hundreds of South Koreans took part in counterdemonstrations
against the students this past week, calling for an end to violent
confrontations. Newspapers have joined in the criticism.
   ``We now call upon our students to return to their senses,'' The
Korea Times said in an editorial Saturday. ``Violence is not the
way to solve any problem,'' The Joong-ang Ilbo said.
   The radicals battled riot police in parts of Seoul on Monday as
the government blocked them from marching to the North Korean
border for reunification talks. Scattered violent clashes involving
a few thousand radicals also erupted last weekend.
   Twice during the weekend, hundreds of people went to radical
headquarters at Yonsei University to demand that the students
leave. The two groups argued and yelled.
   Angry onlookers also denounced and heckled student demonstrators
in other parts of Seoul, and newspapers reported similar outbursts
in other cities. Elderly people screamed at students, calling them
rude and arrogant.
   ``You students are not the only Korean patriots!'' one old man
shouted.
   In the most unusual development, a few people hurled stones at
students, and some were seen helping riot police fighting the
radicals.
   Observers have been impressed by the number of people
spontaneously criticizing the students.
   Kim Young-won, a political scientist, said was amazed to see
onlookers cheering on riot police in a street battle against
students. He said it was remarkable that riot police should
suddenly be seen as heroes after years of beng despised for
enforcing authoritarian rule.
   The change, he said, ``may prove to be the first indication that
citizens have become weary of the persistent, violent actions of
misled students.''
   Student leaders admit they have failed to gain public support in
the latest round of protests, although they refuse to give up their
struggle or change their tactics.
   ``We should have strengthened our solidarity with the people ...
we have to admit our failure in doing so,'' said student leader Oh
Yung-shik.
   Students played key roles in battling past authoritarian regimes
and many people took to the streets with them in June 1987 to force
President Chun Doo-hawn to agree to democratic reforms.
   Many South Koreans say the current violent demonstrations are a
threat to stability and the nation's efforts to build enduring
democracy. They also oppose the students advances to communist
North Korea.
   President Roh Tae-woo and other government leaders have warned
repeatedly that disorder won't be tolerated during the Olympics.
   ``The people and the government will not forgive anyone who
spoils the (Olympic) festival through mob action or the throwing of
firebombs,'' Roh said in a speech Monday.
   The radicals have not decided if they will try to disrupt the
Games or stage protests. They back North Korea's demand to be a
co-host at the Olympics, which the International Olympic Committee
has rejected.
   But the students would find it difficult to disrupt the Games.
The government is deploying a massive security shield to forestall
any threats.

<HEAD>Vigorous Exercise In Heat Can Lead To Danger With Few Warning

<TEXT>
   Vigorous exercise such as running, bicycling or
even hiking uphill in intense heat can lead to heat stroke and
possibly a heart attack with few warning signs, researchers say.
   The danger becomes even greater when the air contains high
levels of carbon monoxide and ozone, both of which put additional
stress on the heart and lungs, one of the researchers said in an
interview Tuesday.
   The researchers were interviewed following the recent disclosure
that two men had died after competing in races in New York's
Central Park during this summer's intense heat wave.
   The two men reportedly were not runners and were not accustomed
to exercising in the heat, which meant that they faced a special
risk of injury or death.
   ``I don't think it's generally recognized that even in these
short races, when you're exercising very intensely and you're not
trained or acclimated, you can very quickly produce and store
enough heat to kill you,'' said Edward Coyle, director of the Human
Performance Laboratory at the University of Texas in Austin.
   ``They were untrained, unacclimated and they were running very
intensely for their level of ability,'' he said.
   In New York and many other parts of the country, the intense
heat has often been accompanied by unusually high pollution and
ozone levels.
   Carbon monoxide can trigger a heart attack in exercisers who
unknowinly have latent coronary artery disease, said Peter Raven,
an exercise physiologist at the Texas College of Osteopathic
Medicine in Ft. Worth.
   Ozone irritates the lungs, causing the tiny airways in the lungs
to shrink and decreasing the amount of breath taken in with each
inhalation, Raven said.
   ``We've had elite cyclists complain at very low levels of ozone
that they couldn't perform anywhere near where they're used to,''
he said.
   Exercisers should be concerned whenever the ozone level is
reported to be higher than one-tenth of one part per million, Raven
said.
   According to the American College of Sports Medicine, the amount
of heat produced in muscles that are exercising hard is 15 to 20
times that produced in muscles at rest.
   Even short races can raise body temperature from its normal 98.6
degrees to 104 degrees, which is the point where serious injury can
occur, the college says.
   This problem is not limited to runners, but can occur with any
type of exercise that involves expending a lot of energy, including
brisk walking and hiking, especially uphill, Coyle said.
   Coyle, an expert on fluid loss and replacement during exercise,
said that dehydration is one of the prime causes of heat stroke.
   Unfortunately, dehydration is a difficult thing for an exerciser
to be aware of, Coyle said. ``It's difficult to tell that you are
in danger because you don't often get sufficient warning time, or
you don't get warnings early enough.''
   Exercisers who are seriously dehydrated will feel chilled and
stop sweating, Coyle said. Their skin turns white and they will
feel tingly sensations _ the hair on the back of the neck stands up.
   ``At that point you know you're in trouble. Stop exercising and
seek some help to try to cool yourself down. Usually at that point
you're not thinking very clearly, so it's important to try to get
some help,'' Coyle said.
   Raven noted that many exercisers will develop a headache,
especially around the temples, as the first sign of impending heat
stroke.
   ``People will have it but they tend to ignore it,'' he said.
``And that's the danger signal.''
   Researchers had these tips for people who want to exercise on
warm days:
   _ Drink at least a quart of water per hour of exercise. Avoid
drinks high in sugar and other carbohydrates because they stay in
the stomach too long.
   _ Take a week to gradually increase your exercise program so
that you become acclimated to the heat and pollution. The body
adapts to cool itself faster. The more acclimated you are, however,
the more water you need.
   _ Exercise before 8 a.m. or after 7 p.m.
   _ Watch children carefully, because they can become overheated
more easily than adults.

<HEAD>Fox Breaks into the Top 50</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC had six shows in the top 10 last week _ so
what else is new? Fox had one show in the top 50. Now that's news.
   The new Fox network's leader in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings
last week was ``America's Most Wanted,'' which finished 47th. Its
rating of 7.9 was the highest ever for a Fox series, and led the
way to the network's best Sunday night.
   Fox's ``Married with Children'' had a 7.4 rating on Sunday for
54th place, ``21 Jump Street'' had a 5.8 and 65th place, ``The
Garry Shandling Show'' had a 5.2 and 66th place, ``The Tracey
Ullman Show'' placed 69th with a 4.2 and ``Duet'' was 71st at 2.8.
   NBC won the week _ its eighth week in a row and 41st time this
season _ by placing five of its Thursday night shows in the top 10.
NBC had an average rating of 11.5, followed by CBS at 10.5 and ABC
at 9.4.
   For the 47 weeks of the season, NBC leads with a 14.7 average,
followed by CBS at 12.4 and ABC at 12.3.
   Each rating point represents 886,000 homes with television.
   ``Cheers'' on NBC was the top-rated show, followed by ``The
Cosby Show,'' ``A Different World'' and ``Night Court'' on NBC,
CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``L.A. Law'' on NBC,
a special Tuesday night showing of ``Full House'' on ABC, and a tie
between ``Circus of the Stars'' on CBS and ``Blood Vows: The Story
of a Mafia Wife'' on the NBC Monday Night Movie.
   Fox said its Sunday night lineup was No. 1 among women ages
18-34.
   Unfortunately for Fox, it is now little more than a Sunday night
network, and a money-losing network at that. In June, owner Rupert
Murdoch he was committed indefinitely to supporting the network,
despite losses of $80 million last year.
   Fox has an automatic liability in the ratings wars: it now has
122 affiliates, compared to 207 for NBC, so its potential viewing
audience is smaller.

<TEXT>
   An undercover narcotics officer making an arrest
was fatally shot in the face Tuesday by the gun of his sergeant,
whose arm was bumped by a suspect, police said.
   The officer, Joe Galapo, 30, was shot about 6 p.m. in Brooklyn,
and died at 8:49 p.m. at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan,
authorities said.
   Galapo and Sgt. William Martin, who worked on the same Brooklyn
narcotics squad, were conducting a buy-and-bust raid and making two
arrests when a scuffle broke out, Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward
said.
   One of the suspects turned, bumping the arm of Martin and
causing the gun Martin was holding to fire, Ward said.
   Although police had not confirmed that the shot that struck
Galapo was from the sergeant's gun, there were no other shots
heard, Ward said at a news conference.
   ``The sergeant's recollection is that something struck his arm.
He says it's quite possible it was his bullet that hit the officer.
He's devastated about it. The sergeant said he did not see a gun in
the hands of the person being arrested or any place else,'' Ward
said.
   Galapo, who joined the police force in July 1983, was married
with three children.
   He was the fourth New York City police officer killed in the
line of duty this year.

   While other farmers wring their hands
in despair and pray for rain, Gene Trimble dresses like a clown and
plays ``Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head'' on his trumpet.
   It may not make the rain come, but it helps Trimble and the
other farmers in his clown band forget their troubles as they make
music strolling through the Illinois State Fair.
   ``This is a way, as one of the songs says, to pack up your
troubles in an old kit bag and smile, smile, smile.
   ``Well, we pack up our troubles in an old horn bag and laugh,
laugh, laugh,'' said Trimble, 63.
   He has traded his tractor for a trumpet every year for the past
26 years during the fair.
   During this year's 11-day fair, he left 300 acres of corn that
wasn't in very good shape on his farm in Newman, about 35 miles
south of Champaign.
   ``It isn't a happy year,'' he said. ``I would say this is as bad
as we've had since 1936.''
   But Trimble said he tries not to dwell on the problems caused by
the drought when he's at the fair. Instead, he puts on his clown
face and polka-dot costume and makes music.
   Of course, there's some clowning around that goes with the music
making.
   As temperatures neared 100 degrees this week, Trimble's
five-piece band roamed the asphalt streets at the fairgrounds
playing ``Jingle Bells'' and ``Let it Snow.''
   The band doesn't play ``Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head''
every day, but maybe it should, said saxophonist Neil Mathews of
Urbana.
   ``If we had, maybe it would have done some good,'' said Mathews,
holding a saxophone sprouting plastic flowers.
   ``We'll have a crop,'' he said of the corn and soybeans his
nephew farms for him.
   But Mathews said this is the worst year that he remembers.
   ``I came over to the fair needing a vacation and about two days
here and I feel fine,'' he said. ``I'm more relaxed than I have
been since I was here last year.''
   Trimble's son, Dana, is a manager for a company that grows seed
corn, a variety he says is more stressed this year than other corn
crops.
   But the younger Trimble paints on a happy face, literally, each
day of the fair, before he straps on the band's drum. He brings a
stuffed monkey, dressed like a clown and holding cymbals, along for
the ride.
   ``These two weeks we spend over here ... is a time that you can
just go and forget all about the corn ... or other headaches that
you have,'' Dana Trimble said.
   He said he has trouble explaining to people why his family
spends its vacation each year in a trailer at the hot, dusty
fairgrounds.
   ``We tell them we come over here for 10 days and wish it lasted
three weeks more,'' he said. ``They can't understand that.''

<TEXT>
   Town officials say they can't afford
$3,000 worth of tests to pinpoint the site of a 211-year-old jail,
the first prison authorized by the Continental Congress.
   ``The town is in a financial dilemma,'' Town Clerk Irene Amsden
said Tuesday. ``This is not the time to be asking for money for
such a project.''
   During the Revolutionary War, the jail housed 3,000 British and
German prisoners.
   The prison was abandoned in 1783 and eventually turned over to
private hands. In 1828, part of it burned. The rest later was torn
down.
   Two Boston University archaeology students want to make sonar
tests and aerial surveys to pinpoint the jail's foundation. The
state Historical Commission pledged $3,000 toward the tests if the
central Massachusetts town of 1,400 people comes up with another
$3,000.

<HEAD>NEW ORLEANS: abandoning SDI.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis does not advocate the spread of communism in
Central America or Africa, but he opposes American aid to the
Contras and to UNITA _ the only forces blocking the spread of
communism.
   Michael Dukakis' ideas about defense differ sharply from past
Republican and Democratic administrations since World War II.
Unlike any of them, he believes that conventional forces can be a
substitute for nuclear deterrence.
   But the most disturbing aspect of Dukakis' approach to national
security is what he doesn't understand about defending the United
States.
   The danger of nuclear blackmail is the first security problem an
American president should face, not only because the Soviet Union
has a large and growing arsenal of ICBMs, but because half a dozen
other countries either have or soon will have nuclear arms and the
capacity to deliver them.
   To speak as though we could defend ourselves against these
weapons with more and better tanks is ludicrous.
   Michael Dukakis simply doesn't take the need for defense
seriously. He even opposed Massachusetts' participation in a
national warning system against nuclear attack. He said a good
communication system _ quote _ ``might make national leaders more
inclined to let a nuclear war begin.'' Unquote.
   This attitude _ that weak is strong, and vulnerable is safe _ is
extremely dangerous. Franklin Roosevelt didn't believe it. Harry
Truman didn't believe it.
   Dwight Eisenhower didn't believe it. John Kennedy didn't believe
it. Lyndon Johnson didn't believe it. Richard Nixon didn't believe
it. Gerald Ford didn't believe it. Jimmy Carter didn't believe it.
Ronald Reagan doesn't believe it.
   George Bush doesn't believe it. Dan Quayle doesn't believe it.
   But Michael Dukakis is more worried about an American
president's misuse of power than about an adversary's use of it.
   The Khomeinis, the Gadhafis and Ortegas, and the proliferation
of nuclear weapons make the world too dangerous for America to rely
on naive, unrealistic, uninformed strategies to defend our freedom.
   And the Soviet Union is too powerful to rely on a president with
no experience in foreign affairs.
   We all (applause), we all hope for liberalization, and reform of
the Soviet Union. I personally take Mikhail Gorbachev's desire for
economic reform seriously and also his understanding that internal
changes are required to achieve it.
   But, Gorbachev and the new generation of Soviet leaders are
sending mixed messages about what they intend _ for their own
society and for the world. Soviet troops are beginning to
withdrawal from Afghanistan. But the flow of arms and money to
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Mozambique, Cuba, Vietnam and to the puppet
government of Afghanistan continues.
   Soviet leaders have spoken of adopting a purely defensive
strategy, but they continue to produce missiles that are ideal for
a first strike against us.
   Inside the Soviet Union messages are also mixed. More Soviet
Jews and pentecostals have been permitted to leave, but the promise
of free emigration remains unkept.
   Which is real: the progress or the repression? Both are real.
   And we need a president who can respond to both realities. We
need a president who knows the world. We can't settle for less.
Mistakes in economic policy can cost us jobs and profits. That's
serious.
   But serious mistakes in foreign policy can cost us jobs, profits
and our freedom.
   We need a president who knows world leaders and world problems
who understands that we must participate and cooperate and
contribute, and protect our national interests _ all at the same
time.
   George Bush knows those things. He learned them from a lifetime
of involvement in foreign affairs. We know where George Bush was
and what he knows and where he stands.
   But in the Dukakis campaign there is a large carefully
cultivated discrepancy between conservative style and liberal
substance. Will it fool enough of the people for long enough to
elect Dukakis president?
   That Democrat who said delegates were told not to talk about
taxes also said, ``There's one problem with this strategy, the
American people are not stupid.''
   And that's right, that's right. The American people will know
better.
   They know there is no cram course for learning about global
politics and world needs and nuclear strategy and national
security. It takes years of study, practice, and being there.
   And, of course, that is why on Election Day the American people
will elect an experienced international leader who knows how to
preserve the peace and expand freedom.
   That's why they will make George Bush the next president of the
United States.
   Thank you very much.

   A strong earthquake jolted the Indonesian
island of Java this morning, the Hong Kong Royal Observatory
reported. There were no immediate reports of damage or injury.
   The 10:05 a.m. (10:05 p.m EDT Tuesday) earthquake, with an
estimated 5.3 magnitude on the Richter scale, was centered about
140 miles southeast of Jakarta, the observatory reported.
   The Richter scale gauges energy released by an earthquake as
measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every
increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in
populated areas. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage.

   The movie company founded by
Italian movie-maker Dino DeLaurentiis has filed for protection
under federal bankrupcy statutes after suffering a string of losses.
   The move Tuesday was expected since DeLaurentiis Entertainment
Group Inc. revealed it had failed to negotiate a debt swap with
bondholders that it had termed essential for survival.
   The company, which made the movies ``Crimes of the Heart'' and
``Weeds,'' and the TV miniseries ``Noble House,'' hasn't reported
financial results for 1987, but has released estimates of a $69
million loss.
   DeLaurentiis, who owns 61.9 percent of the company's stock,
stepped down from management in February.
   ``I am profoundly saddened to hear that DEG has been forced into
bankruptcy,'' DeLaurentiis said in a statement. ``I sincerely hope
... the company can be revived for the benefit of the shareholders,
creditors and other investors.''
   The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing puts the company's debts on
hold and allows management to continue operating the company, under
the supervision of a federal bankruptcy judge, in an attempt to pay
creditors and reorganize.

   With Bruce Willis as a breathing coach,
actress Demi Moore delivered the couple's first child, a girl, at a
hospital in this western Kentucky city, a publicist said.
   The 8-pound, 1-ounce girl was delivered at 7:03 a.m. Tuesday,
according to Western Baptist Hospital and Willis' spokesman Paul
Bloch in Los Angeles.
   The baby, unnamed as of Tuesday night, measured 21{ inches long.
   ``We are ecstatic,'' said Willis, star of ``Moonlighting.''
``The baby is very happy and healthy.''
   Miss Moore recently joined her husband in Kentucky, where he is

   Comedian Jay Leno will continue as
exclusive guest host for NBC-TV's ``The Tonight Show Starring
Johnny Carson,'' the network's entertainment chief said.
   ``This honor for Jay is well-deserved and we look forward to
having him with us,'' Brandon Tartikoff said Tuesday in announcing
renewal of Leno's contract for the 1988-89 season.
   Financial terms weren't disclosed.
   ``Jay has one of the best comic minds working today and has
already brought his own brand of excitement to the show on his
Monday night guest-hosting as well as during the weeks he
substitutes for Johnny Carson,'' Tartikoff said.
   Leno was guest host of more than a dozen editions of the
``Tonight Show'' in 1986 before signing an exclusive contract with
NBC the following year.
   ``The `Tonight Show' is what I like doing the most,'' Leno has
said in the past.

   Tennis star Chris Evert says she may retire this
year if she wins another major event.
   ``I'm going to play out the year. If I won a big one this year,
I would probably retire at the end of it. And if I don't, I may
still retire,'' the 33-year-old Evert said in an interview
published in September's Esquire magazine.
   But, she added, ``I'll quit when I want to quit. Not when people
want me to quit.''
   After more than 20 years of competitive tennis, Miss Evert said,
``you dream about holding that plate up over your head and winning
a Grand Slam, or Wimbledon, being Number One in the world. And it's
never what you think it's going to be. Because it lasts about an
hour.
   ``You know, the feeling is just so fleeting,'' said Miss Evert,
who married Olympic skier Andy Mill last month. ``You think it's
going to stay with you forever. But the sun comes up the next
morning, and you still have responsibilities in life.''

   American actress Page Hannah, star of the film

how to do the latest dance craze.
   ``I went shopping in London and when the young (store) assistant

`teach me the shag,''' Ms. Hannah said Tuesday.
   ``We just started dancing in the store,'' she said. ``I've been

   The 24-year-old actress, younger sister of movie star Daryl
Hannah, has spent two weeks in London promoting the film, which

   The film, directed by Britain's Zelda Barron, is the story of
four girls who get into mischief during a weekend in the resort

   City officials have dedicated a new
library branch to black author Margaret Walker Alexander.
   ``I don't know whether I'm coming or going,'' the 72-year-old
writer said at Monday's ceremony. ``I'm a little shaky inside. I'm
glad you decided to do this now and not wait until I'm dead.''
   The celebrated author of the novel ``Jubilee'' said she got her
library card when she was 7 years old and has always considered the
library home.
   ``Two of the books I've done required years of research. So I
know the value of the library and I always tried to instill that in
my students,'' said Walker, who has taught at Jackson State
University for 11 years.
   Walker's ``For My People,'' a book of poetry, and ``Jubilee''
are best-sellers that won prizes as her master's thesis and
doctorate dissertation before their publication.

<HEAD>French Quarter Merchants Find Republicans Are Penny Pinchers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The hotels are full and the taxis are taken.
But economically speaking, little is trickling down to the French
Quarter, where the Republican National Convention is turning the
Big Easy into the Big Empty.
   ``Look out there, there's parking! There shouldn't be any
parking,'' said Kerri Rock at the French Market Candle Shop. ``The
hotels are booked solid, so where are they? So far, the Republicans
haven't bought diddly.''
   At the open-air Cafe du Monde, where a handful of conventioneers
lingered over their morning coffee, street performer Mustapha
Hummurburri was trying to tap-dance his way into Republicans'
wallets, if not into their hearts.
   He sang. He danced. He strummed a washtub festooned with
anti-Dukakis bumper stickers. Finally, his pitch turned political.
``To quote a great American, President Ronald `Dutch' Reagan, you
people in the private sector, pick up the slack, Jack! Don't be so
mean with the green.''
   Rock, who moonlights at the Can-Can Cabaret on Bourbon Street,
said the nights are no better than the days. ``The cabaret isn't
sleaze, it's a family show, and it's the only bar on Bourbon Street
that allows children.
   ``We thought we'd be hopping, but business is terrible. Normally
we do three shows a night. Last night, we barely made two.''
   The dearth of shoppers was an unexpected blow to some merchants
who had laid in a goodly supply of souvenirs. Others had been
hoping the influx of delegates and media would boost sales during
the slowest month of the year.
   Instead, ``I'm bored to death,'' said Joyce Vaughan, behind the
counter at the empty Le Petit Carousel, a gift shop. ``This isn't
just slow, it's week-after-Labor-Day slow. And it gets worse. The
elephant stuff isn't moving and if things don't pick up, we're
going to be stuck with it.''
   Ella Wilson of Gautier, Miss., a vendor at the open-air French
Market, faced a similar prospect. Her elephants _ 130 ceramic
pendants that cost her $3 each _ weren't going anywhere. ``My
prices are dropping by the day,'' she said.
   At Aunt Sally's Shop, neat displays of jambalaya sauce, gumbo
file, dirty rice mix, crab boil and other local specialties were
largely untouched by Republican hands. It wasn't just slow there,
either. It was ``very, very, very slow,'' manager Pat Gomez said.
   ``All the hotels are booked with Republicans, so the usual
tourists aren't here. And the local people are scared to come down
here because of the convention. All in all, it's been our worst
business week in some time,'' she said.
   ``We painted our doors, freshened our walls, did all the things
you would do if you were having a party. You clean, you make the
curtains you've always wanted to make, you fix things up.''
   Gomez, nevertheless, remained upbeat: ``Folks will see New
Orleans on TV and want to come down for vacations.''
   But her clerks were frustrated by the obvious prosperity of the
browsers.
   ``They're not spending money,'' said clerk Edna Francis, ``but
they sure have a lot of big bills.''
   A few conventioneers wandered the Quarter, their credentials
pinned to their clothes. Most walked right by Brother Charles Clark
of St. Stephen's Orthodox Catholic Church as he solicited donations
in the sun. ``I had hoped to do better,'' said Clark, who collects
money for the poor. ``I guess they just must not be Catholics.''
   An old woman holding a dirty white dog and a sign that said
``Hungry, homeless, can't feed dog,'' settled herself on a sidewalk
bench. An hour later, she'd collected a quarter.
   ``It's pitiful. Really pitiful,'' said Beau Peters, giving
mule-cart tours of the Quarter. ``You tell them you rely on your
tips and they dummy up like they don't understand English. Either
that, or they ask if you have change for a hundred-dollar bill.
   ``We do.''

   Dan Quayle's is not a household name, but it
soon will be, because George Bush decided to make it one.
   Reaching across the generation gap for a vice presidential
nominee, Bush took charge with a stroke that symbolized the change
in Republican command.
   Tonight, the Republican National Convention formally installs
Bush as its nominee to succeed President Reagan.
   In choosing his running mate, Bush bypassed more familiar names,
defeated rivals, Republicans with power bases of their own.
Quayle's constituents are back home in Indiana. He has a national
constituency of one: George Bush.
   Within hours after he arrived in New Orleans on Tuesday, Bush
dramatized the passage of GOP power. He bid farewell to Reagan,
then began telephoning about a dozen Republican leaders and
officeholders to tell them he would not be asking them to join the
ticket.
   ``I think we were all focusing on Kemp, Dole and Domenici, and
the vice president pulled a fast one,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde of
Illinois.
   Quayle's name had been on the vice presidential prospect lists,
but not at the top _ except on the only list that counted.
   Bush called Quayle shortly after 2 p.m. to say he was the
choice. Then, at a riverfront welcoming rally, Reagan's vice
president introduced his own choice for vice president.
   Quayle, 41, is two years into his second term in the Senate,
after serving two terms in the House. He's trim, athletic,
Hollywood handsome and a skilled television campaigner. His
congressional record is staunchly conservative, and he is a
specialist in national defense.
   ``Dan Quayle's a man of the future,'' said Bush, ``a young man,
born in the middle of this century, and from the middle of
America.''
   ``This is the first baby boomer on any national ticket,'' said
James A. Baker III, the departing treasury secretary who is about
to take charge of the Bush campaign. ``I think the vice president
saw this as a bold reach across generations.''
   Bush is 64, Reagan 77. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the
Democratic nominee for vice president, is 67.
   Quayle is the first child of the post-World War II baby boom to
be nominated for national office. That doesn't necessarily mean
he'll pull the votes of his generation; the Nov. 8 election will
tell. But he does give the ticket a youthful cast that should help
with the baby boom-yuppie generation.
   GOP strength has grown among younger voters, and party
strategists see that trend as the avenue to eventual majority or at
least parity with the Democrats.
   A Gallup poll conducted Aug. 5-7 showed Bush leading by 54
percent to Michael Dukakis' 40 percent among voters under 30 years
of age, while Dukakis led 53-37 among those over 50.
   The Quayle candidacy certainly will draw a contrast with
Democrat Bentsen, 26 years his senior. While Republicans said a
head-to-head vice presidential debate should be to their advantage,
Dukakis argued the other side of the youth issue, praising his
running mate as ``a mature, thoughtful man with real stature.''
   Bentsen said he looked forward to a debate comparing his
accomplishments with Quayle's.
   But Quayle is no rookie, not after a dozen years in Congress. He
is not the kind of unknown quantity Richard Nixon chose in 1968 in
plucking Spiro T. Agnew from the governorship of Maryland.
   His Midwestern base is one of the likely battlegrounds in the
campaign ahead. That territory is crucial to Republican prospects.
The farm belt and the industrial Midwest are prime targets for the
Democrats. Bush fared poorly there in the presidential primaries
and lags in regional public opinion polls now.
   So Quayle's assignment is sure to include heavy campaign duty in
his home territory.
   Some Republicans think Quayle also could help Bush narrow the
gender gap by gaining the votes of women. He won landslide Senate
re-election in 1986 over a female Democrat, showing about equal
strength among male and female voters.
   ``I can't believe a guy that handsome wouldn't be attractive in
some respect,'' said Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
   Well, maybe. But that appeal doesn't work with the activist
women who are most critical of the Republican candidate. ``A pretty
face won't help George Bush with women,'' said Molly Yard, who
heads the National Organization for Women.

<HEAD>Quayle Backed Star Wars, Opposed Plant-Closing Notice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dan Quayle has emerged as one of the Senate's
most fervent supporters of President Reagan's Star Wars
anti-missile shield and spearheaded Reagan's fight to defeat a
Democratic proposal to give workers advance notice of plant
closings.
   During eight years in the Senate, the Indiana Republican picked
as George Bush's vice presidential nominee has consistently urged
the speediest possible development of Star Wars and has used his
post on the Armed Services Committee to argue that allied defenses
need to be beefed up in Europe to meet the Soviet threat.
   Quayle is also a member of the Labor and Human Resources
Committee, where he has spearheaded the Reagan administration's
fight against providing advance notice of plant closings, raising
the minimum wage, and other legislation backed by organized labor.
   Quayle's counterpart on the Democratic presidential ticket, Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, was an active proponent of the plant
closing law which requires 60-day notices by any employer with at
least 100 fulltime workers if a plant closing will result in loss
of jobs for 50 or more employees.
   Bentsen lost no time in offering to renew that debate. At a
rally in Fort Worth, Texas, hours after Bush chose Quayle, Bentsen
said, ``I'm really looking forward to that one. ...Dan Quayle and
the administration lost that debate and the American working man
and woman won it.''
   On July 9, Quayle argued that the mandatory notices required by
the bill were nothing more than an attempt by unions to ``allow the
government to assert itself in the collective bargaining process.''
   But Quayle is best known in the Senate as an expert on defense
issues, a reputation earned through hours spent learning the
shadings of such national security topics as Soviet military
doctrine, weapons performance, and the impact of international law
on arms control treaties.
   Quayle is the ranking Republican on the conventional force and
allied defense subcommittee, which chiefly deals with the 16-member
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Quayle's conservative views were most visible during two major
national security battles in the Senate this year _ over the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) pact and the Pentagon
budget.
   Even though the INF treaty, which requires the elimination of
both U.S. and Soviet medium-range missiles from Europe, was
negotiated by a conservative Republican administration, Quayle was
originally skeptical.
   During weeks of hearings on the pact's effect on NATO's
security, Quayle was one of the few senators who sat through
virtually all of the hearings.
   Quayle questioned if the pact might inhibit deployment of the
Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known, and
demanded that the question be answered before the Senate
ratification vote. Ultimately, he joined the 93-5 majority which
ratified the treaty.
   Last month, when the Democratic-controlled Congress was deciding
whether to approve a Pentagon budget, Quayle said Reagan should
veto the bill because it cut too deeply into the Star Wars budget.
It was advice Reagan followed, even though more moderate
Republicans, such as Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said Reagan should
sign the bill, because it was the best deal the administration was
likely to get.
   Reagan wanted $4.8 billion next year for Star Wars, but the
compromise measure which emerged from Congress provided $4.0
billion.
   As the Senate was preparing July 14 for final passage of the
bill, Quayle moved to have it returned to a House-Senate conference
committee to increase the Star Wars budget and strip out
Democratic-written arms control restrictions.
   ``This is a political struggle between the administration and
the Congress over who is going to run arms control policy, no
question about it,'' Quayle explained.
   Quayle's move lost, 58-35, and he was one of the first
legislators to praise Reagan when the president vetoed the bill
Aug. 3. Quayle termed the veto ``a good, sound decision.''
   On the Labor Committee, Quayle and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
have been the strongest administration supporters.
   But even when Hatch, the White House and major business groups
dropped their opposition to some measures _ such as a ban on the
use of lie detectors to screen job applicants _ Quayle remained a
vehement foe.
   Last March, when the Senate passed the polygraph ban that was
later signed into law by Reagan, Quayle complained the White House
had ``caved like a house of cards.'' He said, ``The administration
does not have the backbone at this time to veto this bill...They
have folded up shop.''
   Quayle was also involved the bitter 1986 Senate fight over
Daniel Manion, a conservative Indiana lawyer whose judicial
nomination became a battleground over Reagan's judicial
philosophies.
   Manion had been appointed by Reagan to a federal appeals court
post in Chicago. Opponents said Manion was unqualified, but
Republicans said he was being criticized only because of his
conservative ideology.
   Manion, a son of the founder of the John Birch Society, had
received a ``qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association,
the lowest passing grade given by the ABA's judicial screening
panel.
   Manion was eventually confirmed, 50-49, on a tie-breaking vote
cast by Bush in his vice-presidential role as presiding officer of
the Senate.

   The search for a tiny, eight-legged
creature called the water bear has researcher Diane Nelson
traveling the world.
   The biological sciences professor at East Tennessee State
University has strapped on snow skis and hopped aboard airplanes to
Chile, Antarctica, Bermuda and Venezuela, where she found samples
of her unique prey.
   Along the way, her habit of drawing close to trees to find the
minute water animals has drawn stares.
   ``People look at you funny when you go up to trees and start
hugging them,'' she said. ``They think you're kind of off your
rocker, a mad scientist. And when someone comes up to you and says,
`What are doing?' and you say, `I'm collecting water bears,' they
think you're weird.''
   The creatures, known scientifically as tardigrades, exist in
high-moisture areas, but when the water dries up, they merely curl
up and go into a form of hibernation.
   ``When the water evaporates they begin pulling in all their
little legs and they stay that way until it rains again,'' she
said. ``While they are in that stage you can expose them to
radiation, very high temperatures, very low temperatures and you
can't kill them. They don't age, all of their chemical reactions
stop.''
   Water bears, seen more clearly under a microscope than with the
naked eye, look like nothing more than a dirt spot during dry
spells, Ms. Nelson said.
   Ms. Nelson grew interested in water bears while working on her
doctorate at the University of Tennessee, where she saw her first
tardigrade under a microscope.
   ``I finally saw this little water bear and it just turned around
and looked up at me,'' Ms. Nelson said. ``It was love at first
sight.''

   Boasting a 95-pound squash and a 23-pound
cabbage, Sarpy County gardeners won bragging rights over Washington
County gardeners in their annual competition to grow oversize
vegetables.
   The victory Tuesday was only the second for Sarpy County since
the counties began their competition in 1980.
   ``This might be good for the competition,'' said Mary Sully,
wife of Washington County Fair agricultural superintendent Louis
Sully. ``We've been stomping them pretty bad since it started, so
this will give them some hope.''
   Sarpy County won the competition 5-4 by producing the largest
squash, potato, onion, pepper and cabbage. Washington County
produced the largest muskmelon, watermelon and tomato and the
tallest cornstalk, 167 inches.

<HEAD>Report Says US Agency Polluting Antarctica</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Science Foundation says it is
working to clean up its act in Antarctica, where an environmental
group says the federal agency's research bases are polluting the
frigid environment.
   ``We're making progress,'' says Jack Talmadge, head of NSF's
polar coordination and information section. ``Nobody here wants to
rape Antarctica. We want to preserve it.''
   Talmadge made the comments Tuesday after the Environmental
Defense Fund released a report alleging that the agency's bases in
Antarctica are violating U.S. environmental laws and an
international agreement governing use of the frozen continent.
   ``The environmental practices of the NSF ... would not be
permitted anywhere in the United States,'' said the EDF, which
frequently brings lawsuits against polluters in this country.
   The group said the science agency is dumping untreated sewage
and other wastes in Antarctic waters, engaging in open burning of
some wastes and operating diesel power generators without emissions
controls.
   The report said McMurdo Sound, adjacent to the largest U.S.
installation, is more polluted than virtually any U.S. waterway and
that highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyls and heavy metals are
being found in the tissues of penguins and seals.
   ``It is incredible that these practices are observed by the U.S.
government in the most pristine environment in the world,'' said
Bruce Manheim, the report's author and an EDF attorney and
scientist. ``Rather than addressing environmental threats in
Antarctica, NSF has ignored them.''
   Talmadge said that many of the report's findings are true, but
he said the agency is taking steps to improve environmental
practices at its four bases.
   NSF, which gets $125 million a year for its Antarctic
activities, is in the process of adopting an environmental
protection plan and may ask Congress for cleanup money, according
to Talmadge.
   ``We have been doing pollution control, maybe not as
aggressively as they'd like,'' he said, referring to the EDF. ``We
have been undertaking extensive efforts to clean up since 1980.''
   Talmadge said this year, NSF shipped 160 tons of scrap metal and
more than 500 drums of waste oil out of Antarctica. He said those
materials are no longer dumped in the Antarctic waters.
   He said the agency is reviewing a recommendation by an internal
safety panel that it stop using hazardous materials to ignite
wastes in open-air burning pits. He said raw sewage is dumped into
Antarctic waters because officials believe it is less harmful than
the chemicals that could be used to treat it.
   The EDF report said the United States is not the only polluter
among the 18 nations with bases in Antarctica. It noted, however,
that Australia and Japan remove all wastes from the continent and
that Poland and New Zealand treat sewage and control incinerator
emissions.
   The report said that if the United States did a better
environmental job in Antarctica, it ``would be in a much stronger
position to press for more comprehensive pollution control by less
responsible nations.''
   EDF said the NSF operations, which include 1,000 people at
McMurdo during the Antarctic summer months, violate U.S. laws
regulating ocean dumping and land disposal of waste materials.
   The landfill at McMurdo does not comply with the international
Code of Conduct on Waste Disposal adopted in 1975, according to the
report, which said NSF officials told a Senate panel last year that
it was ``in full compliance'' with the code.
   ``We comply with most of the code except that provision,''
Talmadge said. ``As far as we know, we are in compliance'' with
U.S. laws, he said.
   The report said NSF, despite a 1978 directive from Congress, has
failed to assess the environmental impacts of its activities,
including dynamite blasting and construction near Antarctic
wildlife colonies.
   ``In 1980 ... NSF promised to issue pollution control
regulations and to mitigate environmental impacts, but neither of
these actions has ever been taken,'' the report said.

   George Bush played simultaneously to his
weakness with Midwesterners and women and his strength with younger
voters by naming Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate,
pollsters say.
   Quayle was not the popular choice: most voters and even most
Republican National Convention delegates are unfamiliar with him.
``Nobody ever heard of him outside of Indiana,'' said Jeff
Alderman, chief of polling for ABC News.
   Indeed, in a national ABC poll of 456 registered voters Sunday,
not one mentioned Quayle for vice president. And in an Associated
Press survey of 1,274 convention delegates, not one favored Quayle
to run with Bush.
   That is not to say Quayle won't fly. Running mates frequently
enter the spotlight from obscurity; Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas
also was little known in opinion polls before his selection to join
Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   Instead, political polling experts said Tuesday, Bush appeared
to address several strategic considerations in choosing Quayle:
   _Recent polls say Bush's weakest region is the Midwest. Voters
there are not strongly committed to either ticket, meaning a native
son might boost the Republicans.
   _Bush is strongest among younger voters, but they are the least
reliable at turning out at the polls. If the 41-year-old Quayle
energizes young Republicans and independents, it would shore up a
Bush base. Also, a running mate 23 years his junior could help Bush
appear as a strong leader.
   _Bush suffers from a well-documented gender gap, lagging far
behind Dukakis in support among women voters. Quayle, however, ran
against a woman, Democrat Jill Long, in his 1986 re-election race,
and beat her in a landslide. An ABC exit poll found he had equal
support from women and men in that election.
   ``The hope is that he can help on the gender gap,'' said
Claibourne Darden, an Atlanta-based pollster for candidates of both
parties.
   Darden also suggested that Bush selected a young running mate in
hopes of asserting his own leadership, an area in which he has been
weak in the polls after eight years of subordinating himself to
President Reagan.
   ``Bush needs to be the boss,'' said Darden, and establishing
that image could have proven more difficult had he picked a figure
as well-established as himself, such as Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Pollsters said Bush seemed to eschew the conventional wisdom
about vice presidential nominees, that they are most helpful in
their home states. Bush was considered likely to win Indiana even
without Quayle. For Dukakis, by contrast, Bentsen chiefly boosts
the Democrats in a close Texas race.
   ``The track record on vice presidential candidates is mixed on
being able to deliver their states,'' Alderman said. ``On their
ability to draw regionally, there's no track record.''
   Still, Alderman said, Bush's choice was ``a signal that he's
thinking like Dukakis. He's going to run a national campaign and he
hopes to get something out of the Midwest.''
   In a Gallup poll released last week, Bush trailed by 19 points
in the Midwest, compared to 10 in the West and nine in the East and
a lead of seven in the South. But there was a sign of opportunity:
only 27 percent of Midwest voters supported either candidate
strongly, the lowest level in any region, said Gallup pollster
Larry Hugick.
   On age, the Gallup poll found Bush leading Dukakis by 14 points
among voters younger than 30, while he trailed by nine among those
30-49 and by 16 among those 50 and up.
   The Republicans ``have been able to do better with young
people,'' said Alderman. ``But that's the group that doesn't
vote.'' Quayle could help.
   Quayle also is a strong conservative, but that is one area in
which Bush did not need much assistance; he already led by 60-29
among conservatives in an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll last
week. Darden, in fact, saw a troublesome sign for the GOP ticket in
Bush's selection of a conservative.
   ``Bush is perceived by the great, great majority of the public
as conservative to conservative-moderate,'' Darden said. ``He
already had the conservative vote in his pocket.''
   As Dukakis moved to the center with the more-conservative
Bentsen, Darden said, he expected Bush to move to center with a
moderate. ``What bothers me is there's no reasonable ideological
balance on the Republican ticket,'' he said. ``Balance wins.''

<HEAD>Expert Says Heat Could Kill Thousands</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising temperatures across America are
overwhelming vulnerable people and could kill thousands, according
to an authority on health and the environment.
   ``This will probably emerge as one of the largest natural
disasters of this century ... and it will have just whispered its
way by,'' said W. Moulton Avery, executive director of the Center
for Environmental Physiology in Washington.
   By ones and twos, the poor and elderly are succumbing to the
heat, which overtaxes their bodies, he said. But most of these
tragedies will pass with little notice, being recorded in
government statistics as heart attacks or strokes, rather than
heat-related fatalities.
   In the end, Avery warned Tuesday, this summer's stifling
temperatures threaten to exact a higher death toll than the 1980
heat wave that killed an estimated 15,000 Americans,
   ``If I had in my hand right now the number of people that have
died this summer (from heat) it would be front-page news all over
the country, but I don't have that number,'' said Avery, whose
non-profit center researches the effects of heat and cold on humans
for government agencies and other clients.
   He has argued for a reporting system to record heat deaths, but
statisticians must depend on comparing deaths during heat wave
years with ``normal'' years and calculating the excess fatalities.
That was the system used to determine the 15,000 extra deaths in
1980.
   ``What we're living through now is the same thing we were living
through in 1980,'' and is worse than many other hot summers, he
said.
   Normal death rates nearly doubled from Oklahoma east during a
1966 heat wave _ with deaths jumping to five times normal in St.
Louis _ according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   The Senate Special Committee on Aging later reported that heat
waves in 1963 and 1966 claimed a total of 11,000 lives.
   And a University of California at Berkeley study found that hot
spells in Los Angeles in 1939, 1955 and 1963 each produced more
excess deaths than any recorded natural disaster in that state,
including the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906.
   Those most vulnerable to heat stress are the elderly, who
already may suffer various ailments, Avery said. In 1980 the
elderly accounted for 70 percent of the excess deaths in the hot
weather, he said.
   After a few days of a heat wave, the elderly begin to arrive at
hospitals with heat-related problems, said Dr. Keith Sivertson,
director of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine
in Baltimore.
   Older people, he said, ``are more vulnerable for a variety of
reasons. Mostly because their physiologic reserve is gone with age.
Their heart function tends to be just enough, their mental function
tends to be just enough, all of their organs are functioning just
enough. For some folks, it's not quite enough on some days, and
they end up in the hospital.''
   In addition, he noted, the elderly use more prescription
medications, and many of those drugs can increase sensitivity to
heat.
   Heat-caused deaths do not arouse the concern they should because
of the lack of a reporting system, Avery said.
   As a result, only classic cases of heat stroke get reported
officially as heat deaths to the Centers for Disease Control, and
those amount to perhaps 200 in a normal summer and 1,500 to 1,600
in a hot summer such as 1980, he said.

   Meat and poultry production is expected to
decline in 1989 from this year's record level, but the Agriculture
Department says output still will be 2 percent more than in 1987.
   The decline next year will occur partly because fewer hogs and
fewer ``non-fed'' cattle, those that are not sent to feedlots
before slaughtering, will be going to market next year, USDA says.
It says that will mean further increases in consumer meat prices.
   ``While per capita meat consumption is likely to decline from
the 1988 record, it will remain above the large levels of
1985-87,'' the department's Economic Research Service said Tuesday
in a new outlook report.
   The 1988 supply of red meat and poultry is at a record level,
rising to more than 60 billion pounds, a 3 percent increase from
last year, the report said.
   But production next year is expected to drop 1 percent to less
than 59.2 billion pounds. All of the decline will come at the
expense of red meat, while poultry output is forecast to gain 4
percent.
   Beef production, forecast at 21.6 billion pounds in 1989, is
expected to drop 6 percent, while pork, at 15.5 billion pounds, may
decline only 1 percent. Lamb and mutton production is expected to
rise 2 percent to 335 million pounds, while no change is forecast
for veal production, estimated at 400 million pounds.
   Retail prices for Choice-grade beef may go up 1 percent to 3
percent in 1989, following this year's estimated rise of 3 percent
to 4 percent, the report said. Pork prices are expected to go up 3
percent to 4 percent in 1989 after declining 3 percent this year.
   Wholesale broiler prices are forecast to average in a range of
51 to 57 cents per pound, compared with 53 to 56 cents this year.
Turkey prices, at 68 to 74 cents, are expected to increase from
this year's wholesale average of 61 to 64 cents.
   The report said the U.S. cattle and calf inventory on July 1 was
down 1 percent from a year ago. This year's calf crop, estimated at
40.2 million head, is up only slightly from 1987 but is still the
second-lowest since 1961.
   During the first half of this year, 10 percent more heifers
calved and entered the cow herd than in the same period of 1987,
``suggesting that the cattle inventory may begin to stabilize in
1989-90,'' the report said.
   ``Beef cow slaughter during January-July was 9 percent below a
year ago, while dairy cow slaughter was down 3 percent,'' the
report added. ``However, drought-reduced forage supplies and higher
feed costs may delay expansion.''
   Beef output may drop 1 percent this year as expanded production
by feedlots partially offsets reduced production of non-fed beef.
   ``In 1989, beef output is expected to drop 6 percent as non-fed
slaughter remains low and reduced feeder cattle supplies result in
lower fed cattle slaughter,'' the report said.
   Prices paid for Choice-grade steers on the Omaha, Neb., market
were at record highs this spring and may average $69 per 100 pounds
of liveweight for the year, compared with $64.60 in 1987.
   ``Reduced supplies in 1989 may boost prices $4 to $6 per
hundredweight above 1988,'' the report added.
   Higher feed costs and lower hog prices are forcing pork
producers to cut back from this year. Even so, analysts said 1989
output still may be up 8 percent from 1987.
   Hog prices at the major markets may average about $44 per
hundredweight this year, down from nearly $52 in 1987l. Prices in
1989 may average in the range of $44 to $50.
   ``Despite higher feed costs, broiler production remains
profitable and is expected to rise 4 percent in 1989, about the
same as this year,'' the report said. ``Poor returns since mid-1987
and higher feed costs may slow turkey production increases to 1
percent in 1989, following gains of 19 percent and 5 percent in
1987 and 1988.''
   Egg production may decline about 1 percent in 1989, following a
2 percent cutback this year.

   Federal and state agencies should start now to
find ways to protect America's coastal wetlands from the rising sea
level predicted for the next century, the Environmental Protection
Agency says.
   The agency makes the recommendation in a study warning that the
nation could lose from 30 percent to 80 percent of its coastal
wetlands by 2100 if emissions of greenhouse gases continue at
present rates.
   EPA said in the study released Tuesday that wetlands, especially
in Louisiana, could be flooded by ocean waters because of rising
global temperatures and melting glaciers and polar ice.
   ``Based on current emission trends, estimates for sea level rise
by the year 2025 range from five to 15 inches above current sea
levels and estimates for 2100 from two to seven feet higher,'' the
study said.
   ``A five to seven foot rise would result in a 30-80 percent loss
of coastal wetlands,'' EPA said.
   ``Although the timing and magnitude of future sea level rise is
uncertain, there is an emerging scientific consensus that a
significant rise is likely,'' the report said.
   Many scientists say the Earth is experiencing the greenhouse
effect, a warming of temperatures caused by heat being trapped by
an atmospheric accumulation of gases like carbon dioxide, nitrogen
oxides and methane.
   Wetlands are vital ecosystems and wildlife areas that provide
flood protection, filter pollutants and help recharge groundwater
supplies. One-half of seafood caught in the United States depends
on wetlands for some part of its life cycle, according to EPA.
   ``Coastal marshes and swamps are generally within a few feet of
sea level and hence could be lost if sea level rises
significantly,'' EPA said.
   ``Although new wetlands could form where new areas are flooded,
this cannot happen where the land adjacent to today's wetlands is
developed and protected from the rising sea,'' it said.
   ``Today's coastal development could limit the ability of coastal
wetlands to survive sea level rise in the next century. Along
developed coasts, there may not be any land available for wetland
creation.''
   EPA said federal and state agencies responsible for protecting
wetlands ``should now begin to determine how to mitigate the loss
of wetlands from sea level rise.''
   The report said the wetlands of Louisiana, which represent about
40 percent of the nation's total, appear to be the most vulnerable
to a rise in sea level.

<HEAD>Company Bars Display Of U.S. Flag As Japanese Visit Steel Mill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHLAND, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The management of a steel plant ordered
workers to take down an American flag because company officials
said it had been hung primarily to embarrass visiting Japanese
businessmen.
   However, Michael Hewlett, president of United Steelworkers of
America Local 1865, said the flag was displayed at Armco Inc.'s
Ashland Works ``to show the Japanese we are proud to be American
steelworkers.''
   ``I hate to see a company that forgets what they are, or did
they?'' he asked Monday.
   Hewlett said hourly workers hung the 15-square-foot flag Sunday
night from a beam in a cast house at one of the plant's furnaces.
It was removed Monday before the visiting officials of Kawasaki
Steel Corp. saw it, he said.
   Armco spokesman Bill Scaggs said the order to remove the flag
was made after consulting with top managers at plant, which employs
about 3,500 people.
   ``The flag was put up principally to embarrass our visitors from
Kawasaki,'' he said. ``It was much the same as not offending a
guest in our homes. It was unfortunate that the American flag had
to be hoisted under those circumstances. Patriotism is very much
alive at Armco.''
   Scaggs said the Kawasaki officials were at the mill to discuss
trade agreements.
   Hewlett was particularly incensed by a company offer to let
steelworkers keep the flag up if they displayed a Japanese flag
alongside.
   ``These men didn't do that because of their proud heritage,''
Hewlett said. ``I didn't see Armco flying the Japanese flag from
their flagpole.''
   Scaggs said the Japanese traditionally display both countries'
flags during business meetings with Americans.
   ``If our people wanted to follow that custom, it would have been
acceptable to display both flags,'' Scaggs said. ``We also offered
to let the men display the flag permanently after our guests left.''
   The union turned down the offer and gave no explanation for its
decision, Scaggs said.
   The issue of Japanese imports displacing American jobs has long
been a sore spot with steelworkers. In 1982, union members here
took sledgehammers and pounded a Japanese car into junk, then
packed the pieces into a coffin and tried to ship it to Japan.

<HEAD>US Research Vessel Makes Breakthroughs in Restricted Soviet Zone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first U.S. research vessel in a decade to
steam through the waters of a restricted Soviet economic zone is
making scientific and diplomatic breakthroughs, say officials
involved.
   ``It's going well. All the equipment is working and the weather
is fine,'' said Peter Lonsdale, chief scientist aboard the Thomas
Washington, owned by the U.S. Navy and operated by the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography of the University of California at San
Diego.
   Lonsdale, in a telephone interview Tuesday from the ship, said
the expedition was using a range of measuring and sampling
techniques ``to understand a period of volcanic activity on the sea
floor 100 million years ago.''
   The research, Lonsdale said, will contribute to scientific
understanding of the giant plates which form the earth's crust,
moving and shifting to form continents, island chains and mountain
ranges.
   The ship was charting an undersea plateau at the intersection of
the North Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea, 190 miles from the
Soviet island of Medny, and 220 miles from the U.S. island of Attu
at the eastern tip of the Aleutian chain.
   The vessel, with Soviet scientists Mikhail Krasny and Vyacheslav
Partikeyev aboard, began the 33-day expedition Aug. 5, and entered
the Soviet economic zone Monday, Lonsdale said.
   While scientific results of the expedition will take weeks or
months to analyze, it already has broken diplomatic ground.
   The Soviet Union, like the United States, asserts an economic
zone 200 miles off its coasts. But unlike Washington, Moscow
requires foreign scientists to obtain its permission to conduct
research in those waters, said William Erb, director of maritime
sciences at the State Department.
   Lonsdale's expedition marks ``the first time in 10 years that
the Soviets have authorized a U.S. research vessel to operate in
their economic zone,'' Erb said.
   The project was made possible by an exchange of diplomatic notes
in late 1987 reviving for one year the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Agreement on
Cooperation in Studies of the World Ocean, which was signed in 1973
but allowed to lapse.
   U.S. and Soviet officials will meet in Washington starting Oct.
3 to negotiate three more American expeditions in Soviet waters
under the agreement, Erb said.
   Previously, he said, ``the Soviets had denied us permission and
were acting in a way that we felt was not in conformance with the
Law of the Sea and normal practice. We raised the issue in
bilateral diplomatic conversations,'' but not in an international
forum.
   The plateau under study straddles U.S., Soviet and international
waters.
   Measuring 250 miles by 60 miles, the plateau belongs to a longer
chain of volcanic islands and submerged mountains that include
Hawaii and a new formation, the Lohi Seamount, an active volcano
rising in the north-central Pacific.
   ``It is a continuous trail of volcanic activity that leads 3,500
miles to Hawaii,'' Lonsdale said. ``The theories we are testing
have to do with what might cause this volcanic activity to start.
We know the result: islands like Hawaii.''
   Some recent studies suggest that islands and seamounts form when
weak spots in the Earth's crust pass over hot volcanic spots, which
act as blow torches.
   The sophisticated hardware aboard the Thomas Washington includes
a high resolution survey system known as Sea Beam, made by the
General Instrument Corp., of Westwood, Mass.
   Sea Beam sends 16 simultaneous sonar signals toward the ocean
floor, measures the return time and uses a computer to make a
topographic chart.
   The expedition also is collecting rock samples and cores from
the sea floor for later analysis, Lonsdale said.

<HEAD>Bentsen Says He's Pleased To Run Against Quayle</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Speech in San Angelo sked for noon EDT; may be led</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Until Tuesday, the Republican vice
presidential nominee was the devil he didn't know.
   Now Lloyd Bentsen knows. And the Democratic vice presidential
candidate is saying he won't have a devil of a time handling George
Bush's choice of Dan Quayle, a colleague from the U.S. Senate.
   Bentsen, in the middle of a nine-day campaign swing through
Texas, first heard about the selection when he arrived here for a
rally. He quickly hailed the choice in his speech as ``good news.''
   ``I must say, I'm really looking forward to that one,'' said the
senator from Texas who would debate the young Indiana senator Oct.
11 in Omaha, Neb., if Quayle accepts. Bentsen already has said yes.
   ``I'm looking forward to comparing our lists of accomplishments
in the U.S. Senate, and what each of us could do for his running
mate if we were elected,'' he said.
   ``I've just had a debate with Dan Quayle and it shows again the
lack of sensitivity for the concerns and the problems of the
average working man and woman in this country'' shown by the
Republican. ``That debate was over plant closing, and Dan Quayle
and the administration lost that debate and the American working
man and woman won it,'' Bentsen said.
   President Reagan eventually signed the legislation, sponsored by
Bentsen, but only grudgingly. The bill requires that employers give
workers 60 days' notice before closing the plant where they work.
Quayle fought the bill in the Senate.
   Bentsen has been campaigning almost exclusively in Texas during
the Republican convention. In addition to running for the vice
presidency, he is seeking re-election to the Senate and he has been
seeking coverage in his home state while the Republicans dominate
the national news from New Orleans.
   His events have been targeted for the local market, with an
announcement on the space program Monday in Houston and a visit to
a strategic oil repository in Beaumont on Tuesday. He planned to
visit San Angelo, Lubbock and Tyler today.
   When reporters asked Bentsen on Tuesday why he seemed so pleased
with the choice, he said, ``I think what people are looking for in
this country is substance, and I think I bring that to the ticket.''
   Did that mean, he was asked, that he did not consider Quayle a
man of substance? Bentsen chuckled, and just said he was ready to
compare records.
   Bentsen's aides privately seemed delighted with the choice of
Quayle. ``He is a candidate we are comfortable going against
because of the obvious mismatch'' in experience, said one, speaking
on the condition that his name not be used. ``But,'' he added,
```we don't want to underestimate the guy.''

<HEAD>Vanishing File Clerk Falls Through Floor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   People know about loopholes in the law, but
how about holes in the courthouse?
   It was news to Calvin Jones, a file clerk at the D.C. Superior
Court, but he learned in a hurry when he was helping another clerk,
Michael Morris, move a heavy steel cart.
   Suddenly, there was a crash and Jones disappeared, falling
through a gap in the floor. He careened past air ducts and through
a suspended ceiling and then bounced off a desk, a chair and a
table before his descent ended, one floor down, about 20 feet from
the desk of the building's chief engineer.
   ``I couldn't figure out what happened to him,'' Morris told The
Washington Post of the Aug. 4 incident. ``I thought, `Where did he
go? Where is he?'''
   Jones was treated at George Washington University Hospital for
back pain and was released. He had not returned to work by Tuesday,
and the newspaper said he could not be reached for comment.
   Concerns about lawsuits prompted court officials and officers of
the Sherman R. Smoot Construction Co., which is renovating parts of
the courthouse, to refuse to comment on the accident, the Post said.

   George Bush ruined lunch for a lot of people
by calling to say they were not going to be his vice presidential
running mate.
   He made the calls soon after his plane landed at Belle Chasse
Naval Air Station on Tuesday. The last in the series was reserved
for the one man who got a ``yes,'' _ Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina said his call came about
noon. He quoted the vice president as saying: ``We've made a
decision on this. I wanted to call you and let you know.''
   Other ``Sorry, you're not it'' calls went out to Bob Dole and
his wife, Elizabeth; Jack Kemp; Pete Domenici; George Deukmejian;
John Sununu _ and the returns may not all be in. Bush went down the
list of everyone who had been asked to submit a personal financial
and biographical information.
   His press secretary, Sheila Tate, said Bush made about a dozen
calls in all and that Quayle's was the last.
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, who is resigning to lead
the Bush campaign, told reporters that Bush ``thought it was
important that there not be any suggestions that the process was
not dignified or that the process was in any way demeaning to the
people who might not be selected.''
   History will record the time of the call to Quayle as 2:06 p.m.
convention time. For whatever significance may be attached to it,
most of those called were at lunch, but Quayle was in his hotel
room.
   Ms. Tate said Quayle was the vice president's ``first choice,
his only choice,'' and that Bush told the senator so.
   The other calls were of the let-them-down-easy variety.
   New Mexico's Sen. Domenici was at Antoine's Restaurant when
Baker reached him and put Bush on the line.
   As Domenici remembers it _ in one long stream:
   ``He indicated to me that he wanted to get a bit of the suspense
out of the air, and told me that I was not his choice, that he was
going to go another way, that I was among the last few that he had
to decide as far as his running mate and appreciated very much what
I had done, the way I had conducted myself, and thanked me for all
my effort, and asked if I would be helpful in his campaign, and I
said `yes, of course.'''
   Kansas Sen. Dole and his wife, the former transportation
secretary, were not in their hotel when the Bush call came at 1:45
p.m. Elizabeth Dole returned a few minutes later, reached Bush
through the White House switchboard, and they spoke briefly.
   ``He called to say the Doles would not be on the ticket,'' said
Walt Riker, the senator's press secretary. ``He said it was one of
the toughest decisions he ever had to make.''
   Mrs. Dole's reaction: ``I have said before that I didn't expect
to be selected. Neither I nor Bob was running for vice president.''
   The senator, meanwhile, was making a luncheon speech. ``I don't
have the foggiest notion who George Bush will pick as a running
mate,'' he said. ``The last call I got was a wakeup call at 7:30
a.m. _ it was the wrong room.''
   Kemp, the congressman from New York who was an odds-on favorite
for the running mate spot _ and made no secret that he wanted it _
also took the call at Antoine's.
   ``There were no tears,'' he said. But ...
   ``Nobody jumped up and down. ... I said, `Mr. Vice President, I
want you to know that my support for you is unconditional.'''
   Deukmejian, the governor of California, was eating at a Cajun
restaurant.
   ``It was a courtesy call,'' the governor said, and he didn't ask
Bush whom he had chosen because ``I thought it would be
presumptuous of me.''
   New Hampshire's Gov. Sununu, another to receive one of the
``Dear John'' calls, said, ``Yeah, you're always a little
disappointed.''
   But, he said, ``George Bush taking the time to make those calls
himself was typical George Bush. It was done in such a way that
after the conversation you felt good.''

<HEAD>GOP Paying Heed to Convention's TV Image</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Substance is the buzzword of Republican
convention planners, but they're paying at least as much attention
to telegenic details as the Democrats did in their openly
made-for-TV convention.
   From a color-coordinated backdrop to a world record balloon
drop, the Republicans are living up to their reputation as masters
of sentiment, celebration and the well-oiled machine.
   The Superdome has been scaled down to a manageable size and
sessions are finishing within minutes of the official schedule. The
demonstrations are running long enough to satisfy the delegates,
short enough to hold the living room audience.
   And no one's outfit has clashed with the curtain behind the
speaker's rostrum. At least not yet.
   Washed with a spectrum of lights, the curtain changes from blue
to red to pink to purple depending on the attire of the speaker.
``We have a lighting designer who is alerted to the color of the
clothing before the person enters, and he makes a selection based
on that,'' said Bob Johnson, assistant producer of the convention.
   An elevator platform at the rostrum makes all speakers look the
same height, both for TelePrompTer readability and camera
convenience.
   ``We try to provide the cleanest head-on shot for the
networks,'' Johnson said. ``Our record is 6-foot-7.''
   Music is another personalized element of the convention. ``If
someone is from a particular state, we will select music
representative of that particular state to give it a personal
touch,'' Johnson said. ``We even take requests. Someone from
Tennessee yesterday morning requested `The Tennessee Waltz,' and we
played it.''
   Personal touches are being combined this week with spectacular
special effects such as the combined balloon-confetti drop after
President Reagan's speech Monday night.
   But that was just the beginning, a paltry 20,000 balloons
stuffed sausage-like into nylon netting and dropped from what
seemed like the heavens in the cavernous Louisiana Superdome.
   Fifty thousand balloons will drop Wednesday night when the Texas
delegation, led by George Bush's eldest son, George W. Bush, gives
the vice president the majority needed to capture the nomination.
   And after Bush's speech Thursday night, there will be 150,000
balloons _ a world record for an indoor balloon drop, according to
Johnson.
   ``Frame that and salute it every morning,'' he said gleefully.
The previous record was 100,000, he said.
   The Republicans, inevitably to best their Democratic
counterparts in balloons, already have topped them in discretion.
   Not for them a party chairman who advises delegates to be a
well-behaved studio audience for a four-night miniseries, as
Democrat Paul Kirk did in Atlanta. Nor are the Republicans issuing
continually revised, minute-by-minute podium schedules that reveal
the power struggles within; their original list of speakers minus
speaking times is holding steady.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, was seen desperately making
the cut sign _ forefinger across throat _ to Arkansas Gov. Bill
Clinton during the governor's 32-minute speech at the Democratic
convention.
   ``We haven't had to do that yet and I hope we don't have to,''
Johnson said with a laugh. The Republicans have reviewed all
speeches and some are even running shorter than planned. Any need
to move along is taken care of by the presiding officer or a quick
music cutoff.
   There was some skepticism over whether the Republicans would be
able to achieve any sense of warmth or intimacy in the 27-story
Superdome. But they reduced the size of the convention floor area
by hanging a 90-foot curtain down the middle, invited a lot of
guests, spotlit the bustling floor and left in dimness tiers of
stadium seats that aren't always filled.
   ``We think it looks crowded and warm,'' Johnson said with
satisfaction. ``The Superdome is a fantastic environment for a
convention.''

   Birds' nests made of swallow saliva are
becoming popular booty for Hong Kong thiefs, as police reported a
second robbery in as many days of the expensive soup ingredient
valued by local connoiseurs.
   Two men posing as customers tied up employees of a Central
district company and snatched 66 pounds of bird's nests worth about
$57,700 Tuesday afternoon before fleeing, a police statement said.
   No arrests were reported in the case.
   The day before, burglars broke into another local business and
made off with nearly 90 pounds of bird's nest with an estimated
value of $77,000.
   Police spokesman Peter Tiu acknowledged that back-to-back bird's
nest heists are unusual in this British colony. He said police did
not yet know if the cases were related.
   Bird's nest soup is considered a healthy food that helps build
up the body and is particularly favored by the elderly.

   State Sen. John Vinich defeated two
opponents Tuesday night in a hotly contested Democratic primary for
the nomination to oppose Republican U.S. Sen. Malcolm Wallop in
November.
   Wallop coasted to his third Senate nomination, amassing 39,130
votes, or 83 percent, with 351 of Wyoming's 474 precincts reporting.
   With the same 74 percent of the precincts reporting, Vinich had
15,821 votes, or 47 percent, to University of Wyoming law professor
Pete Maxfield's 9,833, or 30 percent. State schools Superintendent
Lynn Simons, who entered the race late, had 7,619 votes, or 23
percent.
   ``It appears that we are down to the one-on-one,'' Wallop said.
``It's my hope that the campaign will stay on a high plane because
Wyoming doesn't have time to focus on personalities when the issues
and leadership are so important.''
   Wallop had four opponents in the primary _ Michael Dee, Russ
Hanrahan, Nora Marie Lewis, or I.W. ``Bud'' Kinney _ but they did
not conduct highly visible campaigns.
   In the race for Wyoming's only House seat, Democrat Bryan
Sharratt was unopposed while five-term incumbent Dick Cheney
defeated Bob Morris, as he had two years ago. Cheney had 32,320
votes, or 87 percent, to 4,728 for Morris, or 13 percent in
incomplete, unofficial returns.
   ``I look forward to a good, hard-fought campaign in the fall and
I hope I have the privilage and opportunity to serve them for two
more years,'' Cheney said from New Orleans, where he was attending
the Republican convention.
   Cheney, however, will get off to a slow start against Sharratt.
On Friday the five-term incumbent will enter a Washington, D.C.,
hospital for heart bypass surgery.

   A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Wyoming's secretary of state
must count absentee ballots received through Aug. 22 to protect the
rights of voters living overseas.
   ``It is certain ... that there are some absentee ballots that
have been sent out too late ... and I think that that is an
important thing that all people's proper ballots should be
counted,'' U.S. District Judge Clarence Brimmer said. ``That's
almost something that's as basic as our democracy itself.''
   While the Justice Department prefers that ballots be mailed 30
days before an election, some of Wyoming's 23 counties mailed
ballots only 26 days before the primary.
   Wallop, 55, Wyoming's senior senator, spent little time visibly
working for the nomination.
   There were no confrontations between Wallop and Lewis, who
campaigned on an anti-political action committee stance; Dee, who
advocated legalization of marijuana; Hanrahan, a retired air
traffic controller; or Kinney, who once tried to defeat Wallop's
predecessor, Democratic Sen. Gale McGee.
   Instead, Wallop stressed his record of the past 12 years,
pointing to his support of Western water rights and a strong
defense and his efforts to reduce tax burdens on the oil and gas
industries.
   Although Wallop pledged 12 years ago to remain in Washington
just two terms, he said challenges to Wyoming's way of life, its
environment and the state's and the nation's defense made a third
term necessary.
   On the Democratic side, Vinich, a state senator from Fremont
County, spent much of his time on a vigorous door-to-door campaign.
He also spent thousands on commercials designed to counter charges
that he's too liberal for conservative Wyoming. He was backed by
labor and environmentalists.
   Simons, halfway through her third term as state schools
superintendent, entered the race late but received the backing of
popular former Gov. Ed Herschler.
   Her campaign was overshadowed by mistakes on Federal Election
Commission filings, a slow start on fundraising, and a controversy
over her efforts to get a new car for the Education Department.
   Maxfield, a tax law expert and University of Wyoming professor,
called for an oil import tax to ``revive and stabilize an industry
that's vital to not only the national economy but I believe the
national defense.''

   Technicians moved into Discovery's
cargo bay to begin plugging a tiny gas leak that threatens to delay
the first post-Challenger shuttle launch.
   With the shuttle poised on the launch pad, the technicians today
were to drill into the cargo bay wall and an engine compartment to
repair the tiny leak discovered a month ago.
   The leak in a steering engine compartment must be stopped before
Discovery can be launched in late September or early October.
   The plan was to use a routing tool to cut two holes in the rear
bulkhead of the 60-foot-long cargo bay and two more in the
adjoining aluminum hull of the steering engine compartment.
   The dual openings would allow a technician to reach about 12
inches into the compartment to clamp a clamshell-shaped device over
the leak and fill it under pressure with a sealant. The device
measures 4 inches by 1 inch and should fit easily over a fitting
that is slowly leaking nitrogen tetroxide gas from a vent line.
   Because Discovery is poised vertically on the launch pad, the
technicians would have to do much of the work on their hands and
knees or lying on their stomachs on the cargo bay's rear bulkhead.
   On Tuesday, workers opened the bay's doors and erected a
tent-like structure over the work area to prevent debris from
getting into the rest of the shuttle or into a nearby enclosure
where Discovery's payload is waiting to be loaded. The payload, a
communications satellite, would be placed aboard once the repairs
are complete.
   The line with the leak services a steering engine system that is
separate from the three main engines test-fired on the launch pad
last week.
   The repair and subsequent testing are expected to take about a
week, said Lisa Malone, a National Aeronautics and Space
Administration spokeswoman.
   Although the leak was detected a month ago, NASA decided to put
off repairing it until after the main engine test.
   The launch team is continuing to troubleshoot the only fault
resulting from the test firing: a small amount of hydrogen gas
detected after the test by a sensor in an area where lines join the
shuttle with its external fuel tank. For the firing, the tank was
loaded with liquid hydrogen and oxygen to fuel the main engines.
   Malone said the source of the hydrogen remains a mystery, and
pressure tests on Monday failed to detect any leak. She said
officials did not consider it a serious problem.
   ``Once the source of the hydrogen is found, engineers will
determine whether it is an acceptable condition or what course of
action is necessary to proceed,'' Malone said.
   Elsewhere, at the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah, engineers
prepared for Thursday's fifth and final prelaunch test-firing of a
redesigned solid fuel booster rocket. Insulation, seals and O-rings
have been deliberately flawed in segment joints to see how well
backup systems contain the blazing exhaust gas.
   A faulty booster rocket joint was blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986
explosion of Challenger that killed its seven-member crew.
   The Utah test is the last major hurdle before NASA sets a firm
launch date for Discovery.

<HEAD>Dukakis Campaign Ridicules Choice of ``J. Danforth Quayle''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The campaign of Democrat Michael Dukakis seized
upon the selection of Sen. Dan Quayle as the Republican vice
presidential candidate to characterize the GOP ticket as elitist,
with aides referring to Quayle by his full name _ J. Danforth
Quayle.
   Dukakis aides already were fond of referring to George Bush by
his full name _ George Herbert Walker Bush _ and they quickly
adopted the same tack in talking about Quayle, heir to an Indiana
publishing fortune.
   ``I think they'd make better tennis partners than a presidential
ticket,'' said Mark Gearan, a spokesman for the Democratic nominee.
``Or should that be squash partners?''
   Dukakis himself did not attack Quayle directly but was quick to
point out the experience of his own running mate, Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas, and to imply that the 41-year-old Quayle would
not be ready to be president should a tragedy befall Bush.
   ``Sen. Bensten is a mature, thoughtful man, with real stature _
somebody who's a real leader in the United States Senate,'' Dukakis
said. ``Sen. Bentsen has been seasoned, experienced on issues of
foreign policy, defense, space. That's the kind of stature, that's
the kind of strength, the kind of maturity I think you want in a
vice president _ especially when that vice president may be
president.''
   Bentsen, at a rally in Fort Worth, Texas, called the selection
of Quayle ``good news.''
   ``I must say, I'm really looking forward to that one,'' he told
about 400 people gathered in a downtown square at a rally sponsored
by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   ``I'm looking forward to comparing our lists of accomplishments
in the U.S. Senate, and what each of us could do for his running
mate if we were elected,'' he said.
   A vice presidential debate is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 11
in Omaha, Neb., and Bentsen said he was ready.
   ``I've just had a debate with Dan Quayle and it shows again the
lack of sensitivity for the concerns and the problems of the
average working man and woman in this country'' shown by the
Republicans, Bentsen said. ``That debate was over plant closing,
and Dan Quayle and the administration lost that debate and the
American working man and woman won it.''
   President Reagan eventually allowed the legislation, which gives
workers 60 days' notice of plant closings, to become law without
his signature. But he fought it for a long time, and Quayle was one
of the president's allies in the Senate.
   Dukakis and several top aides expressed mild surprise at the
selection of Quayle and predicted he would not help the GOP ticket
except in his traditionally Republican home state of Indiana. Bush
aides countered by saying Quayle would help with younger and women
voters.
   Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich said Quayle's
qualifications pale in comparison to those of Bentsen.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen clearly passes the first test of the vice
presidency _ he is eminently qualified to step in as president in
the event of a tragedy,'' Estrich said.
   Gearan said he was not very familiar with Quayle's record but
then quickly listed a series of issues which he said highlighted
the different directions of the Democratic and Republican tickets.
   He cited Quayle's support of a freeze on Social Security
benefits and his opposition to advance notice of plant closings,
drought assistance and civil rights legislation.
   ``He does not understand the economic problems facing the
American family,'' Gearan said of Quayle. Bentsen supported all of
the measures Gearan cited in attacking Quayle.
   Dukakis aides for weeks have been terming Bush's selection of a
running mate as his opportunity to step out of Reagan's shadow and
demonstrate his independence. After the Quayle choice was
announced, they swiftly criticized Bush.
   ``This was his chance to show some independence, strength and
leadership,'' Gearan said. ``Instead he placated the extreme right
wing of his party.''

   The Federal Trade Commission says Montgomery
Ward has promised to stop making claims about home appliances that
the government charges were false.
   The commission said in an annoucement Tuesday that the giant
retailer has signed a consent agreement to stop making reliability
claims for products unless it has evidence to support them and to
stop making contested claims relating to maintenance of products.
   The FTC had said Ward misrepresented the need to buy a service
contract that would cover routine maintenance when it sold some
products, such as televisions, washing machines, dryers and

   Although Iran and Iraq have agreed to a
cease-fire, the Pentagon says four U.S. warships have departed as
scheduled for routine rotations in the Persian Gulf.
   Defense officials who requested anonymity said Tuesday the
deployments and that of a fifth ship last week was simply an
indication that the United States would not reduce its military
presence in the region until officials were certain the cease-fire
was fully in effect.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci ``has said repeatedly we can
begin to reduce the number of ships in the gulf after a prudent
amount of time has passed to make certain the threat has
diminished,'' one source said.
   ``Our guideline throughout will be as stated by the secretary _
that we will maintain forces there consistent with the perceived
threat,'' said Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman.
   ``The cease-fire is scheduled for Aug. 20. We're not ready to
start really drawing down yet,'' said one source.

<HEAD>US Sends Aid to Nicaraguan Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department says that for the past 10
days the United States has sent about six tons of food, clothing
and tents to assist a large group of Contra rebels and Nicaraguan
civilians who have fled to southern Honduras.
   According to reports from the border area, more than 1,000
soldiers and civilians arrived there last week from a central
Nicaraguan combat zone. Another group, estimated at about 2,500, is
said to be en route to the area.
   Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Tuesday the Nicaraguan exodus
was the result of increased repression by the Sandinista government
and because Contra units have been left without any means of
resupply inside Nicaragua.
   ``The blocking of delivery of humanitarian aid by the Sandinista
regime has resulted in severe hunger, disease and injury to some
resistance fighters,'' she said.
   The assistance, part of $17 million in humanitarian aid approved
for the rebels by Congress last March, is intended to help sustain
the Contras through September.

   Supporters of Vice President George Bush
almost came to blows with about a dozen gay rights activists who
disrupted a speech by Bush upon his riverfront arrival for the
Republican National Convention.
   So hostile was the exchange Tuesday that police intervened and
escorted the demonstrators away. One demonstrator later was
arrested and booked for disturbing the peace.
   As soon as Bush began speaking at the rally alongside the
Mississippi River, the mostly young, male protesters locked arms
and stood in a circle about 30 yards from the podium.
   The demonstrators carried pink and green signs accusing the
Reagan administration of failing to fight acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, and chanted, ``40,000 are dead of AIDS _ where
was George?''
   Bush supporters shouted back, ``Bush '88!'' and surrounded the
protesters. Some Bush backers shouted obscenities and one reached
to tear down a protester's sign. Another man in the crowd pulled
him away saying, ``Don't do it, it looks bad.''
   Police then hustled the demonstrators away. Bush did not stop
speaking or acknowledge the protest.
   Earlier Tuesday, about 20 people staged a protest at a New
Orleans pharmaceutical company, IMREG, which makes one of the few
drugs said to be effective against AIDS.
   The point was to complain about government red tape, which has
tied up approval of the drug for general use. That protest was
peaceful and concluded without incident.

   Crumbling ceilings, falling sinks, broken
toilets, no cold water. The Pallas Suite hotel, home of the New
York delegation to the Republican National Convention, is no
palace, according to guests.
   ``When we walked into our room, half of the ceiling was
convenient, where you could get at it, on the floor next to the
bed,'' Rep. David Martin, R-N.Y., said Tuesday. ``Makes it real
easy to paint.''
   The hotel cheerfully moved Martin and his wife to another room,
where the water wouldn't run out of the sink or tub, but ran out of
the toilet and onto the bathroom floor.
   ``But we've still got a sense of humor,'' he said.
   Chris Cowman, a field producer with Cable News Network who was
covering the convention, said he had to change rooms also.
   ``I put one hand on the sink and stepped out of the shower and
the sink fell away from the wall,'' he said.
   Henry Bayles, a spokesman for Delta Towers Ltd., the
Atlanta-based company that owns the hotel, admitted the Pallas
Suite was not trouble-free.
   ``We're not the finest hotel in New Orleans. If we were the
finest, we'd have (the) California or Texas (delegations),'' he
said.
   The 1,039-room hotel had some problems when delegates began
checking in on Sunday, Bayles said, but he claimed the number of
complaints received since then has been relatively low.
   ``It ran today between 49 and 52, and if you say, `God, that
sounds terrible,' call some of the other hotels. You'll find that's
extremely good,'' he said.
   The building was erected in 1950 and underwent a $56 million
renovation in 1982, said Joanne Caldwell, the general manager. She
said she didn't mind the complaints ``because I'm getting a lot of
free advertising.''

<TEXT>
   A judge rejected a bid to remove the
executor of Liberace's multimillion dollar estate, overruling
claims by his sister and four associates that the lawyer had looted
the estate after orchestrating a deathbed will.
   Tuesday's ruling ended one chapter in a long court battle over
the entertainer's fortune. State District Judge Michael Wendell
still must rule on who will pay the legal fees.
   Attorneys for the executor, Joel Strote of Beverly Hills,
Calif., have asked that the fees be paid by the plaintiffs,
including Liberace's 74-year-old sister, Angie, who was left
$594,000. She had described herself as penniless.
   The other plaintiffs were Liberace's housekeepers Dorothy
McMahon and Gladys Luckie, long-time manager Seymour Heller, and
Cary James, Liberace's companion the last six years of his life.
   In closing arguments Tuesday, plaintiff attorney Harold Gewerter
said if the lawsuit hadn't been filed, Strote ``would have kept on
the path of raping the Liberace estate.''
   He said Strote had coerced Liberace into signing a revised will
13 days before his death, leaving Strote in charge. Gewerter argued
that Liberace was not capable of making rational decisions or
reading the 100 pages of legal documents.
   ``Joel Strote has become the largest single beneficiary of the
Liberace estate,'' Gewerter said. He said Strote had been paid
$500,000 in legal fees and was making $250 an hour sitting through
the court proceedings. He said Strote welcomed lawsuits against the
entertainer's estate so he could keep making the legal fees.
   Strote's actions were ``tantamount to robbing from a dead man,''
he said.
   But defense attorney John O'Reilly said Strote had taken the
Liberace foundation, with $100,000 in assets at the time of the
entertainer's death, and turned it into an $18 million entity by
selling off the estate's assets.
   He said the Liberace Foundation for the Performing Arts had been
a long-time dream of the flayboyant pianist, who died Feb. 4, 1987
of complications from AIDS. The foundation was formed in 1979 to
provide art and music scholarships at 30 colleges and universities.
   He said the plaintiffs had become accustomed to the good life
while Liberace was alive, and wanted more out of the estate after
his death.
   ``Liberace dreamed a dream, then made it become a reality,''
O'Reilly said. ``The plaintiffs lived a dream but can't face
reality. It's been said man must pay the fiddler. Liberace chose to
subsidize a whole symphony orchestra. Now they're saying `Just give
us control.'''

   Old Man River keeps rolling, and so do
Republican bon vivants who have booked dozens of cruises on the
mighty busy Mississippi.
   Vice President George Bush made a lively entrance Tuesday aboard
the Natchez, a leisurely-moving steamboat. The California and
Louisiana delegations staged a friendly weekend race between the
Creole Queen and the Cajun Queen, both paddlewheelers.
   Insurance magnate W. Clement Stone took over the Natchez for a
four-hour Tuesday night dinner-and-drinks trip to honor House
Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill. Delegations from Utah, Ohio
and Michigan also have relaxed on river cruises.
   The Creole Queen, a replica of an 1880s riverboat, chugged
downriver Tuesday night at United Technologies' expense,
entertaining participants in a program for international political
leaders.
   Forget the brawling, bawdy days of rowdy roustabouts on Mark
Twain's big river. These tourist tubs boast amply-stocked galleys
and bars, upper-deck dance bands, and attendants in crisp uniforms.
   The Creole Queen, with its realistic but diesel-driven
paddlewheel, is host to 20 GOP river trips during convention week,
said bookkeeper Paula Hontz. Most are late-night cruises that show
off the New Orleans skyline.
   ``The attraction is the riverboats themselves, and everybody
wants to see our river. It's New Orleans, it really is,'' Ms. Hontz
said.
   For $3,200, party-throwers may have the run of the Creole Queen
at any hour of the day. ``If you buy the entire boat, we can be
very flexible,'' she said.
   But buying the boat doesn't guarantee the bar or the buffet.
   Ms. Hontz said menu prices start at $5 a head for gumbo or red
beans and rice. Or extravagant hosts can shoot the works at $30
each for smoked salmon, Beef Wellington, Crawfish Monica, or
Creole-style crudites with fresh basil and green onion.
   The Cajun Queen edged the Creole Queen in Sunday's contest. But
there were no hard feelings. The delegations shared convivial
toasts and seafood afterward, and California Gov. George Deukmejian
got a lesson in the Cajun two-step. ``It was a lot of fun,'' the
governor said.
   The Natchez will carry passengers to the outlying bayous or to
nearby Audubon Zoo. For Bush, it made a splashy arrival on the
downtown riverfront at Spanish Plaza, which was jammed with
decidedly GOP spectators.
   A silk-hatted calliope player aboard the Natchez dazzled all
with a shrill, nimble-fingered rendition of ``Dixie.'' Red, white
and blue balloons released from the top deck scattered over
downtown office towers.
   An emcee for Bush's arrival party said 1,000 supporters were
aboard the Natchez. It listed toward port as they jammed the
dockside decks to cheer the vice president. A banner hanging from
an upper deck proclaimed: ``Steaming To Victory.''

   Dan Quayle's sister believes the Indiana
senator won't let his candidacy for vice president hurt the family
life he and his wife, Marilyn, enjoy.
   ``I don't think it will be tough on the family,'' said Martha
Saddler, Quayle's sister, who lives in Huntington, Ind. ``Since
he's been in politics, we all kind of shake our heads at his hectic
schedule and wonder how he does it. But he does it and loves it.''
   The Quayle family and friends were celebrating Tuesday afternoon
after George Bush announced he wants the 41-year-old Indiana
senator to be the Republican nominee for vice president.
   Those who have known the Quayles for years said the senator and
his wife have remained relatively unchanged by their years in
public life.
   Dan and Marilyn Quayle met as law students in Indianapolis,
married while they were still in school and remain close to many of
their friends from that period.
   ``One of the greatest things about him is the job of being a
senator has not changed him a bit,'' said Indianapolis attorney
William R. Neale, treasurer of Quayle's 1986 re-election campaign.
``He's the same nice guy he was in law school.''
   Neale, who grew up with Marilyn Tucker Quayle in Indianapolis,
introduced Dan Quayle to his future wife at a student gathering at
the Indiana University law school in the early 1970s.
   Dan Quayle, who grew up in Huntington, graduated from DePauw
University, a small liberal arts college in Greencastle, Ind.,
before going to work in the Indiana attorney general's office in
1970.
   Daniel F. Evans, also a law school classmate of Dan Quayle, said
he doesn't expect Quayle's national candidacy to change him.
   ``I think his strength is he'll remember who his friends are
even after this,'' said Evans, who was chairman of Quayle's 1986
campaign.
   Friends said the Quayles are devoted to their three children and
prefer quiet nights at home to nights out on the town in Washington.
   ``His family looks like the family both parties are trying to
appeal to,'' said Mitch Daniels, former political chief in the
White House and now president of the Hudson Institute. ``It's a
beautiful family. I think they'll be a real asset.''
   The couple, who married in 1972, have a 14-year-old son, Tucker;
a 12-year-old son, Benjamin; and a 9-year-old daughter, Corinne.
   When they campaign in Indiana, the Quayles often tour in two
groups _ the boys riding in parades with Marilyn Quayle and Corinne
and her father visiting county fairs.
   ``The kids are nonchalant, normal kids,'' said Mrs. Saddler.
``They take it in stride and play.''
   In an interview with Indiana reporters Monday, the Quayles said
they had worried during the vice presidential speculation about the
family's loss of privacy during a national campaign.
   ``The total lack of privacy is going to be the biggest minus,''
said Mrs. Quayle, 39.
   Quayle said he had questioned each of his children about whether
he should accept the vice presidential spot if Bush offered it.
   Tucker was fascinated by the idea, Quayle said. Benjamin was
ambiguous but he thought Secret Service agents might be able to
help him on tests at school, Mrs. Quayle said.
   Corinne didn't like the prospect of having her father spend more
time away from home, Quayle said.
   ``She told me, `Daddy, I really hope George Bush picks Bob
Dole,''' said Quayle.

<HEAD>Kean's Keynote Accuses Dukakis Of Duplicity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McHUGH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   In a convention keynote which also raised his
national profile, New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean hammered on an
emerging Republican theme that Democrat Michael Dukakis is out to
dupe the voters.
   Speaking in the Louisiana Superdome on Tuesday night, Kean said
the Democratic presidential nominee and his party were engaged in
double talk.
   ``The Dukakis Democrats will try to talk tough. But don't be
fooled. They may talk like Dirty Harry. But they will still act
like Pee Wee Herman,'' Kean said, referring to the tough Clint
Eastwood movie cop and the childlike television and movie comedian.
   ``They want higher taxes, but they won't say so,'' Kean said in
the prime-time, televised address. ``They want to weaken America,
but they won't admit it. And they want to play the politics of
special interests.''
   The New Jersey governor, selected as the keynote speaker because
of his success in attracting traditional Democrats to the
Republican Party, coupled his attacks on ``Dukakis Democrats'' with
a vision for a George Bush victory in November.
   Reaction to the speech was mainly polite and enthusiastic. From
some, it was exuberant.
   ``That was a great speech,'' said Benjamin L. Hooks, executive
director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People. Hooks called Kean's address ``one of the best speeches I've
heard in the 12 conventions I've attended.''
   ``It was a grand-slam home run,'' said GOP Senate candidate
Peter Dawkins of New Jersey. Kean is chairing Dawkins' campaign.
   ``I'm an old athlete, and I know when somebody's in stride. Tom
Kean was in stride,'' said Dawkins, a winner of college football's
Heisman trophy.
   Kean himself said he was pleased by the speech, but relieved it
was over. ``I felt good. It was fun, but I'll be glad to go home,''
Kean said.
   Kean touted his trademark ``politics of inclusion,'' declaring,
``We will not concede one single vote anywhere.''
   ``With George Bush at the helm, we will go to the farms and the
cities; to the barrios and the union halls; to the suburban
developments as well as the country roads,'' Kean said.
   ``Let the Dukakis Democrats offer the politics of delusion and
exclusion,'' he said. ``We Republicans will practice the politics
of inclusion.''
   Throughout the 36-minute speech, delegates opposed to Kean's
pro-choice views on abortion staged a small but noisy
demonstration. The protestors carried signs reading, ``Gov. Kean is
baby killer.'' They chanted, ``Abortion is murder.''
   Kean did not acknowledge the demonstration. Later, he said he
heard the noise, but did not know what it was. Authorities removed
some demonstrators from the hall.
   Kean took note that the Democrats chose a color scheme of
pastels at their national convention in Atlanta last month, rather
than red, white and blue.
   ``I don't know about you, but I believe Americans, Democrats and
Republicans alike, have no use for pastel patriotism,'' Kean said,
drawing his loudest cheers.
   ``The liberal Democrats are trying to hide more than the colors
of our flag. They are trying to hide their true colors,'' Kean said.
   Democrats chose the pastel colors after deciding they would look
better on television.
   While repeating the ``Dukakis Democrats'' refrain, Kean never
mentioned Dukakis by his full name.
   The governor, who admits to being a less-than-riveting speaker,
won interruptions of applause about a half-dozen times.
   As Kean spoke, New Jersey followers flashed, ``Kean in '96''
signs, suggesting the governor might seek the White House himself
one day. Kean has only one year left in office.
   But, while the local crowd was loyal, others began to fidget as
the speech went on. Kean spoke four minutes longer than Arkansas
Gov. Bill Clinton did at the Democratic Convention last month, in a
speech that made Clinton the brunt of jokes.
   Yet, Kean concluded to an enthusiastic, polite response and
several minutes of applause. The governor beamed broadly as he
accepted the reaction.

<HEAD>Delegates Try To Think Positive About Quayle</HEAD>

   Republicans are looking for nice things to
say about Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, even if many of them hadn't
heard of him before he became George Bush's vice presidential
running mate.
   ``All I know is he is 41, from Indiana and seems attractive,''
Edgar Heiskell, chairman of the West Virginia Republican Party,
said after Bush announced his decision Tuesday. ``He looks like one
of George Bush's sons.''
   Not everybody knew as much as Heiskell.
   Massachusetts Republican Chairman Ray Shamie, who praised
Quayle, confessed that he thought the designated vice presidential
nominee hailed from Ohio.
   ``I don't know anyone in our group who knows Sen. Quayle or
knows how he helps,'' said California state Sen. Ken Maddy. ``I'm
trying to turn myself around and feel good about it, but I can't.''
   One of Maddy's California Senate colleagues, Ed Davis, said ``so
what'' to Quayle's selection.
   ``The decision of the voters will be based strictly on the
presidential candidates, not the vice president or the platform or
anything else,'' Davis said. ``I don't know him. I've never seen
the man. At least we can say he has no negatives at this point.''
   Quayle is considered by his congressional colleagues to be a
conservative with an aggressive debating style who could appeal to
younger voters.
   His selection drew praise from others who had been considered
for the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket.
   Former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole said she was not
disappointed at being passed over and called Quayle a ``fine
choice.''
   Her husband, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who had
been another vice presidential possibility, made himself scarce
after the announcement and issued no statement.
   But Dole, the 1976 vice presidential nominee known for his
occasionally sharp tongue, was gracious when later cornered by
reporters at the convention.
   ``My reaction is they picked an outstanding young man,'' Dole
told a Kansas television station. ``I'm very happy with the choice.
He's a young man, a new generation.''
   ``I was kind of stunned,'' said Sen. William Cohen of Maine, who
had been backing Sen. Dole for the vice presidential post.
   ``He doesn't have the stature of a Dole ... or the following of
Jack Kemp,'' Cohen said, adding that Bush may have been looking
``to do something bold and different and surprise all the pundits
and the experts.''
   Kemp, a New York congressman also passed over for the job,
called the Bush-Quayle pairing ``a very strong ticket for the
Republican Party.''
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said Quayle's obscurity can be overcome.
   ``Nationally nobody knew who Lloyd Bentsen was until he got
tapped for the Democratic ticket, so what difference does that
make?'' Branstad asked.
   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis' campaign was restrained in
its reaction.
   ``This does not affect our campaign strategy in any way,'' said
campaign spokesman Mark Gearan.
   Bentsen, a senator from Texas, called the selection ``good
news'' and said ``I'm looking forward to comparing our lists of
accomplishments in the U.S. Senate and what each of us could do for
his running mate if we were elected.''
   Sen. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, a liberal Republican,
praised Quayle as a friend but stayed away from his stand on the
issues.
   ``First and most importantly, I regularly beat Dan Quayle at
tennis,'' Weicker said.
   ``He's a solid conservative and by that I underline solid about
three times,'' said Weicker. ``So we disagree on the issues, but
I'm very happy for him.''
   While many Republicans were surprised or muted at Quayle's
selection, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who has said for weeks
that he would oppose the selection of anyone who was not
sufficiently conservative, was lavish in his praise.
   ``I'm thrilled,'' Humphrey said. ``I couldn't be more pleased.
I'm excited. I'm enthused.''
   Television evangelist Pat Robertson, who formally ended his own
presidential campaign Tuesday by releasing his delegates, called
Quayle ``a tremendous choice.''
   ``On areas like abortion and school prayer ... he is right down
the line with the evangelicals,'' Robertson said.
   In addition to helping gain support from younger voters, one
delegate said Quayle could boost the GOP's showing among women
   ``If we're behind in the lady vote, my God, if he can't help us
there nobody can,'' said Louisiana state Sen. Ken Hollis.
``Somebody asked me yesterday about him. I said, `He's a good
looking Robert Redford.'''
   Alabama delegate Jack Dunlop was less than pleased with the
choice. The 72-year-old Auburn real estate man, said Quayle is
``too young and too inexperienced.''
   Conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly said she was pleased with
Quayle's selection.
   ``I was supporting Jack Kemp, but he sort of looks like Jack
Kemp,'' she said.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Quayle Will Make Great Vice President</HEAD>

   President Reagan, who learned
George Bush's choice for a running mate in a whispered conversation
before boarding Air Force One, says Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle is a
``proven vote-getter'' who would make a great vice president.
   ``George has made an excellent choice,'' Reagan said in a
statement issued after a flight from New Orleans to begin a
late-summer vacation following less than 48 hours on the scene of
the Republican National Convention.
   Before taking off from Belle Chasse Naval Air Station, Reagan
had a brief meeting with Bush on the tarmac, telling him, ``Nancy
and I want you to know that you have all our support all the way.''
   Aboard the plane, Fitzwater said that Reagan will probably visit
from eight to 15 cities on behalf of the Republican ticket during
September and October. He and the first lady will return to
Washington Sept. 7.
   After their formal airport remarks, Bush was seen to take Reagan
aside at the foot of the ramp before the president boarded the
plane.
   ``He whispered something to him, but I don't know what it was,''
Fitzwater said.
   When reporters asked him to inquire of the president, he went
forward, came back and said that the president did not want to say
what Bush told him.
   When news of the Quayle selection broke after Reagan had arrived
at his ranch north of here, Fitzwater confirmed that Bush had told
the president in the airport conversation.
   ``Vice President Bush has made an outstanding selection,'' the
president said in a formal statement.
   ``He's a proven vote-getter,'' he said. ``I've worked closely
with Dan on a number of issues. He has been a leader in the Senate
for a strong national defense, particularly the Strategic Defense
Initiative and proponent of innovative job creation programs. His
talent, intellect, family, and energy will be valuable assets
during the campaign, and I know he will be a great vice president.''
   Reagan's immediate plans are to relax, ride horseback and do
ranch chores at his 688-acre Rancho del Cielo in the Santa Ynez
Mountains. Fitzwater said he will probably also sign some bills,
probably including trade and fair housing legislation.
   Next Tuesday, he will fly to Los Angeles, with fund-raisers for
Sen. Pete Wilson, Rep. Robert Lagomarsino and the California
Republican Party planned before he returns to the ranch Aug. 27.
Fitzwater said an additional political appearance might be
scheduled during this period. As to the question of more joint
appearances with Bush, the spokesman said there would be some, but
he could not say when.
   Fitzwater said Reagan would watch the convention on television.
There is one television set at the ranch, he said. When Reagan was
last there in July, he watched parts of the Democratic National
Convention, including the acceptance speech of nominee Michael S.
Dukakis.
   The spokesman said Reagan wrote several portions of the speech
he made at the convention Monday night, submitting handwritten
material to speechwriter Ken Khachigian, who produced the final
product.
   He said the president's contributions were especially notable in
the final section of the speech, in which Reagan spoke in emotional
terms of his tenure as president and his thoughts of the future.

   Here is a transcript of the keynote address
by Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey to the Republican National
Convention on Tuesday night.
   Thank you, thank you, very, very much.
   You know, last week, I went to the National Governors'
Association meeting and there was a fellow governor there, his name
happed to be Mike Dukakis. You know, Mike Dukakis gave me this
hourglass and he gave it to me because people had become bored with
speeches at the Democratic convention.
   Well, tonight, I'd like to use it to send a different message,
Mike. Because it proves an important point. Time has run out a long
time ago on your liberal vision of America.
   Tonight I would like to take you on a journey into America's
future.
   We begin, oddly enough, centuries ago, when a ship on a
monumental voyage found itself beset by debate and argument.
   Some wanted the ship to reverse its course.
   They cried, ``Turn back, turn back.''
   But the Santa Maria stayed on its course, and mankind gained a
new world with unlimited hopes and horizons.
   The president that we elect this year will preside over the
500th anniversary of Columbus' journey _ the first voyage in
pursuit of the American dream.
   Historians today agree that Columbus was right to ignore his
doubters.
   But what about our voyage?
   I would not presume to predict the judgment that historians will
make of Ronald Reagan, but I do know they must report the facts.
   And, they will report that today 17 million more Americans have
jobs than just eight years ago.

<HEAD>Comments From Former Veep Candidates on Quayle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Here are comments on the choice of Sen. Dan
Quayle of Indiana as the Republican vice presidential nominee from
some of those who had been considered for George Bush's running
mate.
   
   SEN. BOB DOLE of Kansas: ``My reaction is they picked an
outstanding young man. I'm very happy with the choice. He's a young
man, a new generation.''
   
   ELIZABETH DOLE, former transportation secretary and Dole's wife:
``I have said before that I didn't expect to be selected. Neither I
nor Bob was running for vice president. Bob is running for majority
leader of the Senate, hopes to get five more Republican seats so
that he'll have a Republican Senate to work with George Bush. I
think it's a fine choice and look forward to supporting both of
them and working as a Bush surrogate.''
   
   JACK KEMP, congressman from New York, a front-runner and a
favorite of the party's right wing up to the last minute: ``I think
George Bush and Dan Quayle are going to make a very strong ticket
for the Republican Party. I told the vice president I'm going to
look forward to campaigning for a Bush-Quayle ticket in 1988. ... I
told him, `Mr. Vice President, I want you to know my support is
unconditional.'''
   
   SEN. PETE DOMENICI of New Mexico: ``It was kind of a mixed
feeling. Obviously one set of emotions was relief. This is not an
easy thing to carry around. The other emotion was not
disappointment in the sense that I desperately wanted this, but
there is a lingering kind of (feeling that) I think I might have
done a good job and I won't have a chance at doing that.''
   
   GOV. JOHN SUNUNU of New Hampshire said he was ``a little
disappointed'' at being passed over.
   
   SEN. ALAN SIMPSON of Wyoming: ``You will find an outstanding
legislative record. He's a budgeteer, but more importantly he is a
legislator. ... Dan Quayle is not a show horse, he's a work horse.
He may look like Robert Redford, but he has brightness and brains.''
   
   GOV. CARROLL CAMPBELL of South Carolina, a choice of some
southern conservatives, on how the choice will play in his region:
``It'll sell.''
   
   GOV. JAMES THOMPSON of Illinois, who took himself out of the
running: ``He's from our area. He can speak to the hopes and
aspirations of the Midwest.''

<HEAD>Psychiatrist Must Pay $7.5 Million For Stabbing Death By Patient</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered a psychiatrist to
pay $7.5 million to the parents of a woman who was stabbed to death
by a patient of the doctor 10 years ago.
   In his decision last week, Middlesex Superior Court Judge Guy
Volterra upheld the jury's award of $4.5 million, plus $3 million
in interest, to the parents of Shelley Rotman, who was slain by her
former boyfriend in 1978.
   The case has drawn wide attention because of the issue of when,
if ever, a doctor should violate a patient's confidentiality to
warn a potential victim of threats.
   According to testimony at the trial in May, Dennis Gould made
threats against the 23-year-old Milton woman during therapy
sessions with the psychiatrist, Dr. Steven Mirin. But the
psychiatrist said he did not think Gould would carry out the
threats.
   Mirin, a past president of the Massachusetts Psychiatric
Society, is associate director of McLean Hospital in Belmont, a
teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School.
   His attorney, Charles Reidy, argued that the jury was swayed by
prejudice and passion, not reason, and that the verdict was wrong
as a matter of law.
   Paul Sugarman, attorney for the Rotmans, contended that the
psychiatrist was negligent because he failed to adequately warn the
victim, notify police or restrain Gould.
   Mirin had written Rotman a letter telling her that Gould had
talked of harming her. But Sugarman argued that the letter should
have been stronger and more explicit, and that Mirin should have
hospitalized Gould.
   ``When you get someone this sick, you owe a duty to protect
people,'' Sugarman said. ``You owe a duty to see that he's removed
from the community or at least from the ability to do harm.''
   After the killing, Gould was found innocent of murder by reason
of insanity and was placed at Bridgewater State Hospital. The
hospital declined to say Tuesday whether he is still a patient
there.

   Here, at a glance, are the latest
developments at the Republican National Convention.

<HEAD>Bush Picks Quayle to Join the GOP Ticket</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Republican presidential nominee-to-be George Bush broke the
suspense Tuesday and tapped youthful Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana as
his running mate. The choice was likely to bolster the GOP ticket
in the Midwest, a region where Bush fared poorly in the primaries.
   The 41-year-old Quayle, who defeated Democratic Sen. Birch Bayh
in the 1980 Reagan landslide, has a conservative voting record and
serves on the Armed Services, Budget and Labor and Human Services
committees.
   Left in the lurch were a dozen or so leading Republicans, who
got the bad news in a series of brief telephone calls from Bush.

   President Reagan traveled to California to start a late-summer
vacation and praised Quayle as a ``proven vote-getter'' who would
make a great vice president. ``George has made an excellent
choice,'' Reagan said in a statement issued after the flight from
New Orleans.

<HEAD>N.J. Governor's Keynote Says Democrats Have Betrayed America</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, laying out a keynote address plan
for a George Bush victory, told Republicans that ``Dukakis
Democrats'' talk tough as Dirty Harry but ``act like Pee Wee
Herman.''
   Kean accused the Massachussets governor and his party of
betraying America by pandering to special interests and by
relentless taxing and spending.
   The GOP can be the party for everyone, Kean said. ``With George
Bush at the helm, we will go to the farms and the cities; to the
barrios and the union halls; to the suburban developments as well
as the country roads.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Conservative Platform Wins Unanimous Approval</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Delegates chorused their approval of a book-length 1988
Republican Party platform that courts conservatives, cudgels
Democrats and commits the GOP to a child-care tax credit as well as
rapid deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   The platform toes the conservative line on taxes, abortion and
defense. It accuses the Democrats of tolerating corruption and
calls for subjecting Congress itself to civil rights, health and
safety laws. There was neither dissent nor debate on a single
plank. The hall was half-empty as Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, the
platform chairman, and other platform leaders lauded their
40,000-word declaration of philosophy.

<HEAD>New Orleans Turns Up the Heat</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Cool comfort is so coveted in this steamy convention city that
hosts are paying $1 per square foot to air-condition party tents.
The goal all over town is red-hot good times, not red-hot guests.
   Republicans can beat the sticky heat in the Louisiana Superdome,
but shirts are soaked after a stroll to the French Quarter. Bar
signs on Bourbon Street tout air conditioning like a specialty
drink. Temperatures all week have been in the mid- or upper-90s,
above the city's normal average daily high in August of 90.6
degrees.

<HEAD>Musicians Hopping With Demand for Live Music at GOP Parties</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Parties are swinging to Dixieland and Cajun waltzes during the
Republican National Convention, a four-day nonstop dance of unity
that's keeping musicians busy around the clock. There's jazz at
brunch, and two-steps by night.
   Can delegates get burned out on Dixieland?
   ``It depends on the individual,'' said Leland B. Bennett, who
heads a 10-piece band that's been too busy to accept all the
invitations to perform. ``Some will listen to only that.''

   Here is the transcript of the speech by
former United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick to the
Republican National Convention on Tuesday night.
   Thank you for your warm welcome.
   Thank you for inviting me to this convention where we can think
together about our problems and our opportunities.
   Presidential campaigns often become divisive and harsh, so
before we get too deeply involved in this one, I think we should be
clear that all Americans want essentially the same things: we want
freedom, we want peace, and we want prosperity.
   We all dislike spending money on weapons. We would much rather
invest our resources on teachers and schools and hospitals and
housing. We would much rather plant flowers in parks than build
bombs. We would much rather invest in medical research than weapons
research.
   We are not a warlike people. We have no imperial vocation. We
are not engaged in a struggle with the Soviet Union for global
predominance. We seek no empire.
   But we cherish our freedom and self-government. And we wish for
others what we desire for ourselves.
   We live in the most violent century in human history _ an age in
which millions have died in wars and more unarmed millions still
have been murdered by their own governments _ Jews, Ukranians,
Russians, Chinese, Cambodians, and many others.
   And so, in our times it has been more necessary than anyone
wished for free peoples to be strong to protect their lives and
freedom.
   So, the question confronting us in this election is: How can we
use our great but limited power to achieve our goals of a peaceful
world of independent nations? How can we make a wise decision about
who will use our power most wisely?
   The last 11{ years demonstrated how much it matters who is
president of the United States.
   Nearly 12 years ago, a very liberal Democrat was inaugurated as
president. The Carter administration began with high hopes and lots
of apologies. President Carter canceled the B1 bomber and the
Trident submarine and the long-range cruise missile. He thought the
Soviet Union would follow suit.
   But as one Carter official said, ``when we built, they built,
and when we stopped building, they built.'' President Carter said
he learned a lot about the Soviet Union when its armies invaded
Afghanistan and began their ghastly war against the Afghan people.
   By the time this ``learning experience'' had taken place, the
United States and the West had lost military superiority. The
Soviet Union had become a global power, a dozen countries had
effectively lost their independence, America had lost credibility
and freedom was in retreat.
   Neither the United States nor the world can afford another
``learning experience'' like that for an American president.
   By the time Jimmy Carter left office, the United States and the
Soviet Union were barely on speaking terms. Arms talks had been
broken off. Cultural exchanges canceled. The United States had
imposed an embargo on grain, and a boycott on the Olympics.
   But today, eight years later, it's fair to say that American
relations with the Soviet Union have never been better. Cultural
and educational exchange programs have been restored and expanded.
So have trade agreements and scientific cooperation.
   One arms agreement has been signed and another is well along the
way. And we are at peace.
   Some of this improvement reflects a new Soviet leader with
different ideas. But much of it is due to the restored strength and
purpose and confidence and skill and persistence of the United
States.
   When the Soviets walked out on arms talks in Geneva, SDI brought
them back to the bargaining table. Mikhail Gorbachev doesn't give
something for nothing.
   The Reagan-Bush administration has known how to strike a bargain
and has had assets to bargain with and the will to persist.

<HEAD>NEW ORLEANS: to persist.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We Americans should ask ourselves: What improves relations? What
strengthens peace? What promotes democracy? What works? A policy of
unilateral concessions and wishful thinking or a policy of strength
and clarity?
   Eight years of American prosperity, peace, and responsible
participation in the world have been good for us and good for
others. And in London and Kabul and Tel Aviv and Abijan and in
Warsaw, and all around the world, people know it.
   Everyone seems to know it _ but the Democratic leadership.
   They said the last seven years had _ and I quote _ ``witnessed
an unprecedented assault on our national interest and national
security.''
   Apparently the Dukakis Democrats do not understand how the
prudent use of American power has helped ... in Afghanistan,
Grenada, and the Persian Gulf and in the fight against
international terrorism and drugs and in the struggle for democracy
in Central America, and Asia.
   That's the bad news. The good news is _ George Bush knows better.
   Apparently the Dukakis Democrats do not understand the role of
American power in strengthening and protecting Israel, or in
negotiating the withdrawal of Soviet missiles that threatened
Western Europe. That's the bad news.
   The good news is: George Bush knows better.
   More bad news: the Dukakis Democrats do not understand how
American power helped promote arms negotiations with the Soviet
Union.
   But the good news is: George Bush knows better, and so does Dan
Quayle.
   The Democrats who met in Atlanta took pains to look nice and not
to talk much about their plans and policies. One delegate to the
Democratic convention explained why they acted the way they did. He
said, ``We're told it doesn't make political sense to talk about
taxes. We're told we should be vague and after we win, we'll get
down to business.''
   Generally speaking, the Democratic delegates did as they were
told. They didn't talk about taxes or about deep unilateral defense
cuts or about Nicaragua.
   They didn't talk about much.
   They left it to us to figure out for ourselves what will happen
when they ``get down to business.''
   Their candidate, another very liberal governor with a
technocratic style and no foreign policy experience, is attempting
now to repeat what Jimmy Carter performed in 1976 in presenting
himself as a man more concerned with competence than with ideology.
   But if you read the Democratic platform, if you listen to their
speeches, if you look at their record, it is clear that the basic
approach has not changed since George McGovern was nominated in
1972, and since Jimmy Carter was elected in 1976.
   That approach features collectivism in domestic affairs,
weakness in defense and deep confusion about America's role in the
world.
   Actually, in spite of their convention's blackout on discussion
of foreign policy, we know a good deal about Michael Dukakis'
approach to foreign affairs _ and what we know is deeply disturbing.
   We know, for example, that he never felt it necessary to
disagree with the policies of Jesse Jackson. We know he's proposed
deep unilateral cuts in most of our weapon systems. We know he said
he would end missile test flights and nuclear testing, that he
would end work on SDI and a missile defense system, and ban
anti-satellite weapons.
   We know he calls for a ``stable nuclear deterrent.'' He imagines
that we can maintain that stable deterrence without developing any
new weapons while the Soviet Union continues to produce new
offensive and defensive arms. We know Dukakis favors arms
negotiations, but his proposed unilateral cuts would leave the
Soviet Union no incentive to negotiate.
   Today foreign policy is vital to our economy, and our security.
Today it is a matter of life and death. Americans deserve a
straight discussion of what a would-be president plans for us. But
Dukakis evades such discussion.
   Michael Dukakis doesn't say he will make America more
vulnerable, but that is the inevitable consequence of unilaterally
canceling our major weapons systems.
   Michael Dukakis doesn't say he will leave us defenseless against
Soviet missiles, but that is the inevitable consequence of
abandoning SDI.

<HEAD>Stocks Rally, Dollar Gains Marginally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices rose across the board Wednesday on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, while the dollar gained marginally against
the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 255 selected issues, the main index
of the exchange, gained 282.31 points, or 1.01 percent, from the
previous day's close, to finish the day's trade at 28,178.86.
   The dollar closed at 133.15 yen, up 0.07 yen from Tuesday's
close of 133.08 yen. After opening at 133.17 yen, the currency
moved in a range of 133.00-133.35 yen in hectic trading.
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange was 850
million shares.
   Traders said a wider-than-expected U.S. trade report did not
have a negative effect on the Tokyo market. The U.S. Commerce
Department reported Tuesday that the American trade deficit widened
to $12.5 billion in June from a revised $9.8 billion in May.
   ``The dollar is still maintaining its ground against other
currencies, and we don't expect any abrupt changes on the Tokyo
market'' said a stock broker at a major securities firm in Tokyo.
   ``The U.S. trade deficit is not a negative factor for us,'' he
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The dollar plunged overnight in New York following the release
of the report, but rebounded sharply by the close of trading to
finish at 133.73 yen, up from 133.32 yen late Monday.

<HEAD>Jury Awards Castrated Rapist $150,000 From Former Sheriff</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A jury says a former sheriff intentionally
inflicted emotional distress upon a rapist, who was castrated while
awaiting trial, by displaying the man's testicles in a jar in the
sheriff's office.
   The federal court jury on Tuesday awarded Wayne Dumond $150,000
in damages from former St. Francis County Sheriff Coolidge Conlee.
   Dumond, 38, is serving a life sentence for raping a young
Forrest City woman in 1985. His attorney, John Wesley Hall, said he
hoped Dumond will receive a new trial by spring on his August 1985
rape and kidnapping conviction.
   ``Maybe this is an omen,'' Dumond said after Tuesday's verdict
in the civil trial.
   Dumond sued Conlee for unspecified monetary damages, charging
that the former sheriff publicly showed the jar's contents to
several people at Conlee's office 3{ years ago.
   ``Coolidge Conlee was holding these up like they were a
trophy,'' Hall told the jury in his closing argument.
   Masked intruders castrated Dumond in his home in March 1985. He
is trying to get a new trial, saying his criminal trial was fixed.
   During the two-day civil trial, a witness, O'Neal Webb,
testified he saw a jar containing Dumond's testicles on Conlee's
desk.
   ``He asked did I know what it was. I said, `You'll get in
trouble for displaying these like this,''' Webb said.
   But Conlee and former county employees said he didn't publicly
display the jar and its contents.
   ``That jar was a hot potato. Coolidge didn't know what to do
with it,'' said attorney Bob Roddey, who represented Conlee and the
county.
   Chuck Thomas, a former deputy, testified he took pictures as
former Chief Deputy Evan Hughes and Deputy Liz Jones flushed the
jar's contents down a toilet.
   The photographs are no longer in the case file and cannot be
found, Hall said.
   In a separate case, Conlee was indicted by a federal grand jury
in May on charges of drug trafficking, gambling, extortion and mail
fraud.

   Madonna, the pop singer turned actress,
celebrated her 30th birthday with a Broadway stage performance and
a private party with her actor-husband, Sean Penn, and other guests.
   But Tuesday's celebrations were continuing today, Penn's 28th
birthday and the couple's third anniversary.
   ``Despite all the predictions, they're still together,'' said
publicist Liz Rosenberg.
   Madonna is working in the Broadway production of David Mamet's
``Speed-the-Plow,'' playing the secretary of a hard-boiled
Hollywood producer.
   ``She has never missed a performance in her life, so 30th
birthday or not, she'll be on stage,'' Ms. Rosenberg said before
Tuesday night's performance.
   Madonna and Penn planned to entertain a celebrity group of
birthday partygoers after the performance, but kept the invitation
list secret, her publicist said.
   Madonna, born Madonna Louise Ciccone, has produced the hit
singles ``Material Girl'' and ``Papa Don't Preach.'' She also has
starred in such films as ``Who's That Girl'' and ``Desperately
Seeking Susan.''
   The couple, known as much for their run-ins with star-gazing
photographers as for their entertainment work, maintain a home in
Malibu, Calif., where they are often seen doing their own grocery
shopping or stopping for hamburgers.

<HEAD>Disabled Mother Gives Up Custody Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman with cerebral palsy who had two
sons taken away by county officials is ending the custody fight her
lawyer says ``galvanized the cause of disabled parents' rights
across the nation.''
   Tiffany Callo, 21, says she has agreed to a settlement that
would allow her 18-month and 8-month-old boys to be raised together
by foster parents and let her visit them every six months.
   ``In this case, it just boiled down to an individual mother's
decision that, at this point in time, it was in her children's best
interest and her best interest to let the open adoption go
through,'' Callo's attorney, Clay Bedford, said Monday.
   Bedford said the custody proceedings Callo had faced were
unconstitutional, an ``all or nothing'' gamble that encourages
parents like Callo to settle for limited visitation. Had Callo
lost, he said, the children likely would have been placed in a
``closed adoption,'' with visitation forever lost.
   ``She would have never been able to see the kids again or hear
from the kids again. It would have been just as if she had died or
the kids had died,'' Bedford said.
   Despite the decision to end the custody battle, Bedford said the
case won support from many other disabled parents.
   ``I think Tiffany has galvanized the cause of disabled parents'
rights across the nation,'' he said. ``There's going to be other
cases because there's a lot of disabled parents out there.''
   After stories about Callo's case appeared in newspapers around
the country last year and earlier this year, she received dozens of
letters in support of her fight and offers to help her raise her
children.
   Callo, who needs a wheelchair to get around, said she has
developed a warm relationship with the foster parents who plan to
adopt the boys.
   ``I feel good about them,'' Callo said of the parents. ``The
lady is taking very good care of my boys.''
   Callo and the boys' father, Tony Rios, who also uses a
wheelchair, married in November but separated soon afterward,
Bedford said. She is now seeking a divorce. Rios did not return
messages seeking comment on the custody arrangement.
   Callo's first son, David, was removed from her home by social
workers last year. Her second son, Jessie, was removed the day
after he was born in January. Neither boy is disabled.
   Callo said Santa Clara County officials initially told her she
was incapable of caring for her children because of her disability.
Later, officials cited other reasons, including her psychological
evaluation, Callo said.

   Here is a transcript of remarks by Vice
President George Bush and Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana at a rally
Tuesday where Bush, the soon-to-be Republican presidential nominee,
announced his selection of Quayle as his vice presidential running
mate.
   Bush: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
   Barbara and I are delighted to be here.
   We pay our respects to Frank Fahrenkopf and all that have made
this marvelous convention possible.
   And I want to thank Peggy Wilson and the others for putting this
on, this marvelous welcoming event.
   Let me just tell you first how pleased we are to be here.
   And we're starting on a new era, because over the past years
we've turned around the failed and faltering policies of our
predecessors.
   We have made progress, and now I want to lead us into the future.
   We have made progress, but we can and we must do even better.
   We can spread the opportunity further.
   We can tackle new problems.
   We can advance peace and growth to even more corners of the
world.
   And I promise you that as president, I will make sure that
America remains the greatest and the freest nation on the face of
the Earth.
   Great progress has been made.
   The Soviets are pulling out of Afghanistan, the Vietnamese out
of Cambodia, the possibility of a Cuban pullout of Angola, a truce
possibly between Iran and Iraq.
   Peace is breaking out all over.
   Our policies are working, and now I want to build on them.
   America is back _ strong, proud, growing, at peace.
   It's working.
   And so I ask you today, do you want to throw it all away and
turn the crowd over to the crowd who brought you that malaise?
   No, we do not want to do that.
   Do you want the big spenders to raise your taxes?
   (Crowd: ``No!'')
   Do you want those central planners to bring back that
double-digit inflation and the interest rates over 20 percent?
   (Crowd: ``No!'')
   Do you want to send our reinvigorated military forces into
retreat?
   (Crowd: ``No!'')
   And do you want to risk the results of eight years of
achievements at home and abroad?
   (Chants of ``No!'')
   I don't think so.
   And that's why I'm here, and I have a different vision of
America.

   I believe we can keep America more competitive in the world if
we keep those tax cuts in place.
   And I believe if we help to get those small businesses started
and get those big businesses smarter, and if we make a national
commitment that America will not settle for second best.
   And I believe, I believe that we can keep America secure if we
keep her strong.
   You know, I also have another belief, and that is that we can
make America's neighborhoods and communities safe if we're tough
enough with the criminals instead of being tough on the law-abiding
citizens.
   Let's be a little _ (applause) _ let's rededicate ourselves to
safe neighborhoods, and to supporting those who support the laws.
   And I believe, I believe most of all that what makes America
great is values _ values like faith and freedom, values like
neighborhood and community, and above all values like family.
   And I have to confess it's my family that gives me strength, and
I don't think I'm alone in America. Families are the thread with
which this country's magic quilt is held together.
   And I brought a few friends of mine along to New Orleans today.
   And if you don't mind, I'd like to introduce them to you now.
   First, you all know the person who keeps me ticking. What you
may not know is how hard she's worked in these last eight years to
help those kids in America who don't know how to read, help them
learn to read, and that's my wife, Barbara. (Applause.)
   And that's what she's done all her life _ all her life, help
other people make the best of themselves.
   Ladies and gentlemen, the secret weapon of the Bush campaign is
my wife, Barbara, and the other secret weapons are my five children
_ I should say ``ours'' _ our five children and our 10
grandchildren, and our children's spouses.
   I'd like to introduce all of them to you here today.

   Here they come. Here they come. Dukakis beware.
   Stand right back there, gang. They're still coming.
   And now I'd like to make a significant announcement.
   Ladies and gentlemen, that big river had me thinking.
   And I've decided to share some big thoughts with you.
   This campaign is about building a better America, and I always
think that there are three components to that: freedom, family, and
the future.
   And for the last few weeks, I've given a lot of thought to the
selection of a running mate and I've made a choice.
   And our party, our party is blessed with a wealth of men and
women who would be excellent.
   But my choice and the one I will recommend is an outstanding
United States senator. He is a leader in matters of national
security. He is an innovator who is leading the effort to retrain
our workers in this country so that they will be able to better
lead the work force of tomorrow.
   My choice for the vice presidency is Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana.
   He under _ (cheers, applause) _ I know. I know. (Cheers and
chanting.) Very pleased. Very pleased. (Continued chanting.)
   Congratulations. (Cheers.)
   Let me just finish, and then you just say a couple words.
   Let me just way one or two more things.
   Dan Quayle understands how precious freedom is. And in the
Senate of the United States, he's been freedom's friend.
   He's a family man, with a loving wife and three beautiful
children.
   And Dan Quayle's a man of the future _ a young man, born in the
middle of this century, and from the middle of America.
   He's a dynamic young leader for the future of our party, the
future of our nation.
   And I introduce to you now my friend, the next vice president of
the United States, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana.
   Quayle: Actually, I was just in the area, and decided to stop
by. (Laughter.)
   I just want to thank you first for the confidence that you have
placed in me, and as I was standing in that audience out there, a
young man turned to me named Steve Shambaugh from Orlando, Fla.,
and I sort of whispered to him that I was perhaps going to be the
next vice presidential nominee, and you know what he told me?
   He says, ``Well, when you get up there,'' he says, ``you tell
George Bush one thing: Go get 'em!''
   (Applause.)
   Let me just say a couple things that Marilyn, our three
children, to George and Barbara, that as we stand before you here,
we are obviously honored; we're obviously a bit humbled.
   But George Bush's America believes and has the commitment to the
American family that is so important to all of us.
   George Bush's America understands the problems that confront us
and can lead us to the future and the 21st century.
   And yes, as we look to the next president of the United States,
let me tell you what my grandfather always told me, that there is
nothing more important in this country than freedom.
   And George Bush will keep the freedom and peace in this world.
   It is George Bush's America that we will work for, we will work
hard, and believe me, we will win because America cannot afford to
lose.

   Here is a transcript of the speech by
Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson to the Republican National
Convention on Tuesday night.
   Thank you very much.
   Ladies and gentlemen, four years ago the keynote speaker at the
Democratic National Convention told us that America was a tale of
two cities _ the haves and the have-nots. The rich and the poor.
The upper class and the lower class.
   We heard a variation on that message from Jesse Jackson and
Teddy Kennedy and every Democrat who spoke last month at their
convention in Atlanta.
   Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come to tell the truth.
   The message of the Democratic Party is a message of defeat,
division and despair. They did not speak for the American people
under McGovern or Mondale or Carter, and they do not speak for
America today.
   But that speaker who compared America to ``A Tale Of Two
Cities'' was right in a way he never intended.
   That great novel by Charles Dickens begins with a double
sentence: ``It was the best of times. It was the worst of times.''
   In 1980, Ronald Reagan and George Bush began a long journey to
rescue this country from the ``worst of times.'' From double-digit
inflation, soaring interest rates and widespread unemployment.
   As Republicans, our task in 1988 is to continue that journey and
build the greatness of America through moral strength.
   Exactly two months and 22 days from tonight some 100 million of
our fellow citizens will go to their polling places to choose the
future course of the United States of America.
   Our tale of two cities is really a choice between two paths. Two
visions of America. Two philosophies of the future.
   When Charles Dickens wrote his epic novel he described in
heart-rending detail the consequences that the right and wrong
choices made in two cities in Europe.

   In city No. 1, under the deceptive slogan liberty, equality,
fraternity _ the people with revolutionary zeal threw out God, the
church, established morality, the established government, their
former leaders, sound currency, and some of the private ownership
of property. Then they demanded that the new government buy them
happiness.
   Instead of the goverment-inspired Utopia which the people
thought they would get, they got liberal divorce laws and a breakup
of families, anarchy, looting, ruinous inflation, and financial
chaos.
   As the madness fed on itself, they got something much worse _
the reign of terror. A time when no one's life was safe from the
dreaded guillotine.
   The second city followed a very different course. There, faith
in God was maintained. There was even a spiritual revival under
John Wesley. Respect for the rule of law prevailed.
   Instead of wild excess, there was self-control and
self-restraint. The currency was strong and families were stable.
Private property was protected and life was held sacred. With all
its faults, England created a strong, stable conservative
government that survived with prosperity for a hundred years.
   So these two cities made choices in 1789 that shaped their
future for decades, for generations, to come. Now 200 years later,
America faces its choice.
   The Democrats have given us a clear picture of their city. They
offer unlimited government, massive transfers of wealth from the
productive sector of society to the non-productive, and
ever-increasing regulation of the daily lives of the people and
their children.
   In the city of the Democratic Party, the liberal mind set reigns
supreme. Criminals are turned loose and the innocent are made
victims. Disease carriers are protected and the healthy are placed
at great risk.
   In the Democrats' city, welfare dependency flourishes and no one
is held accountable for his or her behavior. Society is always to
blame.
   In the Democrats' city, the rights of the majority must always
take a back seat to the clamorous demands of special interest
groups. And yet, in their city it is always the majority that must
pay the bills, through higher and higher taxes.
   Now the Democratic Party has discovered the family. They want us
all in one big family. But let's keep in mind that they want you
and me to be in one family with Jim Wright as the daddy, Barbara
Mikulski as the momma and Teddy Kennedy as big brother. I can't
speak for you, but I believe I would rather pick my own relatives.

   To build their city, the Democratic Party has selected Michael
Dukakis as architect. I submit to you tonight that Michael Dukakis
is the most liberal candidate for the presidency ever put forward
by any major party in the history of the United States of America.
   In fact, the city the Democrats hope to build is so bad that
they are ashamed to mention the word that describes who they are
and what they really want to do. They don't say what it is, they
just call it the ``L'' word.
   They know that their programs will require massive new revenues,
but in their platform they did not mention once the vehicle they
will use to raise the money _ they just call it the ``T'' word.
   Well, ladies and gentlemen, whether by silence, whether by
initials, or whether in a foreign language, it's still
tax-and-spend liberalism and the American people are too smart to
fall for it again.
   There's another word that the Democrats did not mention once in
their platform and not once in the acceptance speech of their
candidate. It's a ``G'' word. The name of God.
   Ladies and gentlemen, our president, Ronald Reagan, was not
ashamed to ask the assembled delegates at our convention in Detroit
to bow their heads in silent prayer to God. As Americans, we are
not ashamed to pledge allegiance to a flag that is a symbol of one
nation under God.
   And I submit to you that our party, the Republican Party,
assembled here in New Orleans, is not ashamed to write into our
national platform our solemn resolve that the children of this
country will once again be allowed to pray to God in the classrooms
of America.
   As an aside, I should mention that Michael Dukakis is a
card-carrying member of the ACLU. As you know, that's an
organization dedicated to removing all public affirmation of
religious faith in America. As president, Michael Dukakis will pack
the federal courts with ACLU radicals. If there were no other
reason, and there are many, to deny Michael Dukakis the presidency,
this is a reason enough for all of us to vote against him in
November.
   Ladies and gentlemen, the Republican Party wants to write a tale
of another city.
   We are the children of those who tamed the wilderness, spanned a
continent, and brought forth the greatest nation on the face of the
Earth. We are the heirs of those who enriched the world with the
electric light, the telephone, the airplane, mass-produced
automobiles, the transistor, and countless wonderful inventions.

   And, yet we are the heirs of a more enduring legacy than mere
material progress. We are the heirs of a legacy of ideas, a legacy
of freedom, a legacy of equality _ of opportunity. A legacy of
government of the people, by the people, and for the people. We are
the heirs of an experiment in freedom that has given hope and
promise to all the people on the face of this Earth.
   We see a city set on a hill. A shining light of freedom for all
of the nations to see and admire. A city made great by the moral
strength and self-reliance of her people.
   A city where husbands and wives love each other and families
hold together.
   A city where every child, whether rich or poor, has available to
him the very best education in the world.
   A city where the elderly live out their lives with respect and
dignity, and where the unborn child is safe in his mother's womb.
   A city where the plague of drugs is no more and those who would
destroy and debase our children with illegal drugs are given life
sentences in prison with no chance for parole.
   A city where the streets are safe. Where criminals are locked up
and the law abiding can walk about without fear.
   A city where the water is pure to drink, the air clean to
breathe, and the citizens respect and care for the soil, the
forests, and God's other creatures who share with us the earth, the
sky, and the water.
   A city with limited government but unlimited opportunity for
every one of its citizens.
   We are Republicans and we believe in government that is our
servant and not our master.
   We believe that the wisdom of the millions who make up the
marketplace is greater than the wisdom of the few who serve in
government.
   We want a balanced budget, but we feel that the way to balance
the budget is to stop waste and mismanagement in government, not to
raise the taxes on the people.
   There is a word to describe us. It is a ``C'' word. We are
conservatives and we are proud of it.

   Some people say they don't care what choice the voters make in
November. That it doesn't really matter.
   I say to you tonight, we care because it does matter. It matters
to us and our children whether we vote Democrat or whether we vote
Republican.
   And we care whether the successor to a great president, Ronald
Reagan, is a liberal who returns us to the failed policies of Jimmy
Carter or a principled conservative like George Bush who moves us
proudly into the 1990s.
   Etched in my mind is the memory of a 40-year-old black man. He
was strong, he was honest, he was hardworking, he was handsome. He
was a family man with a wife and a couple of children.
   He was building a place for himself and his family, when one day
tragedy struck him.
   You see, he couldn't read and write. He had been running a
loading dock for a fertilizer distributor. He got along by
memorizing the colors of the products that he handled, until the
company changed the labels, and he made so many mistakes that they
had to let him go.
   His life is now in shambles. His pride is gone. His hopes and
dreams are gone. He is one more on the welfare rolls. He is one of
the 30 million functional illiterates in America who have been
shortchanged by our educational establishment.
   Ladies and gentlemen, George Bush wants to be known as the
education president. Together we can make our schools the best in
the world if we follow a few simple steps:
   We must guarantee to our children a disciplined, crime-free,
drug-free school environment. Tough school principals should be
made community heroes not community scapegoats.
   We must recognize that the so-called new age curriculum of
progressive education is a colossal failure and must be replaced.
   We must place control of education in the hands of parents and
teachers in the local communities and take it away from Washington,
the federal courts, and the liberal leadership of a powerful
teachers union.

   We must give to every parent the maximum freedom to decide what
school is best for his or her child. Empowering parents with
vouchers and educational choice at the state and local level is an
idea whose time has come.
   Yet some would say we can never have better education without
stronger families.
   In part they are right. In my opinion the breakup of the
American family is the No. 1 social problem in America today.
   Half of our marriages end in divorce. Over 15 million children
now live with a single parent. Single women with children are the
fastest growing segment of the poor in our land. We speak of the
feminization of poverty.
   But what has government done about the problem?
   Successive Democratic Congresses have raised the tax burden on
parents with children an estimated 245 percent over a 20-year
period. In one year federal taxpayers' money was used to institute
an estimated 225,000 divorce actions.
   It has been estimated that 30 percent of all divorces in America
are caused by misguided welfare laws.
   More cruel than all this is the assumption begun by Lyndon
Johnson's Great Society programs that the poor did not have to
strive, to learn, to compete and to excel. This attitude fostered
dependency, then hopelessness, then despair.
   Ladies and gentlemen, we are Republicans and we believe some
basic truths here tonight:
   No. 1 _ Government must seek to strengthen families not tear
them apart.
   No. 2 _ Parents are responsible for their own children. If a man
fathers a child, that child is not the responsibility of the city,
the state, or the federal government. That child is his
responsibility and he and the child's mother should be made to look
after it.
   No. 3 _ Women in our society should have complete access to
challenging and rewarding careers. If women in our society do the
same work as men they should receive the same pay as men for that
equal work.

   No. 4 _ We also need to stop punishing women in our society who
choose to be homemakers. If in our society we can afford to give
tax deductions and credits to working parents with children, we
also can afford to give tax deductions and credits to women who
want to stay at home and care for their children.
   No. 5 _ The goal of welfare must be to restore people in crisis
to dignity and useful employment, not to create a class of
government dependents for whom welfare is a way of life. Whatever
the Democrats may tell you, that is not the way to ``keep hope
alive.''
   But hope is very much alive in America today. It is alive
because our vision, the Republican vision, expresses the hopes and
the dreams of the vast majority of the American people.
   As we leave New Orleans, we will go back to our homes confident
that we are a party united around a platform that expresses the
American spirit _ a platform we can be proud to share with our
neighbors all over this great nation.
   And now, I would like to give a personal message to the millions
of Americans, voters, volunteers, and supporters across this nation
who committed themselves to my campaign. I thank you. I am very
proud of you. And now the time has come for you to make your choice.
   This party is about to nominate as its presidential candidate a
man that I have come to respect and admire. Today we have learned
of the selection of Sen. Dan Quayle as his running mate.
   Dan Quayle beat the liberal Birch Bayh to get a seat from
Indiana in the United States Senate. Only a few members of the
Senate can claim his distinguished record of support for the
Reagan-Bush agenda. He is a staunch defender of freedom, a champion
of family values and a common sense Hoosier who understands the
needs of the farmer and the working man.
   He is young, vigorous and capable.
   Ladies and gentlemen, the George Bush-Dan Quayle ticket can and
will lead our nation proudly into the future.
   Therefore, tonight I release my delegates and alternates who
have come to this convention and urge you and all of my friends
across America to give your enthusiastic support to our party, to
our platform and our presidential and vice presidential nominees.
   As we cast our eyes toward November, we know that a new page of
history will be written.
   On that page we will inscribe the name of the 41st president of
the United States.
   His name will be George Bush, Republican.
   Thank you, and God bless you.

<HEAD>Neighbors Crowing About Rooster, Pet Owner May Roost in Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jose Sanchez' neighbors are crowing
about his 15-pound rooster, and the city says the pet has ruffled
too many feathers in the tranquil neighborhood.
   Sanchez has run afoul of the law _ illegally harboring a rooster
in a residential area. If he loses his fight to keep Travis the
rooster, he could be sentenced to six months in jail and fined
$1,000 on each of four misdemeanmor counts.
   ``Can you believe it? I might end up in county jail with
burglars and thieves. And I'll be there because of a chicken,''
said the 26-year-old Sanchez, who's been fighting the city over the
law for two years.
   His trial begins Monday.
   Deputy City Attorney Frank Rhemrev said he doubts the maximum
sentence will be assessed.
   Many people have told Sanchez he shouldn't risk jail for a
rooster.
   ``You can get warm and cuddly about a rooster just like you can
about a cat or a dog,'' Sanchez said about his 7-year-old rooster.
``Travis is real friendly. ... He's a companion, just like any
other pet.
   ``He just happens to be a chicken.''
   Public Defender Linda Van Winkle has given up trying to talk him
into giving up Travis.
   ``I ask him, `How long do roosters live, anyway?' But he told me
Travis has a good three years left. And I don't think I can get the
case continued for that long,'' the lawyer said.
   Rhemrev said neighbors began complaining about the rooster's
crowing in 1986.
   Sanchez said Travis was 3 years old and living in his back yard
when the law was passed in 1984. Thus, Sanchez said, the rooster
should be the beneficiary of a grandfather clause.

   Here is a transcript of the speech by former
President Gerald R. Ford to the Republican National Convention on
Tuesday night.
   Thank you, Secretary of Transportation Bill Coleman. Betty and I
are deeply grateful for your many, many kindnesses, your loyal
support and we are most appreciative of your warm and generous
introduction.
   Let me say that both Betty and I treasure and cherish our
friendship with you and Lovida.
   During my 40 years of public service, I have been very fortunate
and very blessed to have a wise and courageous partner. She's been
a wonderful mother of four great, great children. And naturally I'm
very proud of the help and inspiration she has given to so many
Americans.
   It's an honor for me to introduce to you my loving wife, Betty
Ford.

   (Betty Ford's remarks: I'm delighted to be here with Jerry, to
help him send George and Barbara Bush on to a Republican victory
and to the White House, where they belong.)

<TEXT>
   (Gerald Ford then resumes his remarks.)
   My fellow Americans, my fellow Republicans. This is my 10th
Republican National Convention. And, God willing, not my last.
   Thank you for inviting me to share in your nomination of my
friend and colleague in so many difficult days and tough campaigns,
the next president of the United States, George Bush.
   And may I say with equal emphasis, I endorse and support Dan
Quayle as the next vice president of the United States.
   Last month, together with a few thousand other diehard
television fans, I watched the Democrats' miniseries in Atlanta.
   I applaud and I salute the tremendous strides that the Dukakis
family has taken to achieve the American dream. I applaud and I
salute Rev. Jesse Jackson for his talents and personal achievements
and for showing millions of black citizens that the American dream
can be more than a dream.
   But my applause stopped short when I saw the Democrats claiming
that they have somehow become the party of the American dream.
   Let's set the record straight. We are one nation, under God, and
we have only one American dream that unites and belongs to all of
us. No party, no politician has a patent on that dream.
   It doesn't matter what state you come from or where your
ancestors came from or which party you prefer, the American dream
belongs to you.
   Except for the native American Indians, we are all of us
immigrants to this blessed land; some came by sailing ships, slave
ships and steamships; some came outcast and oppressed, work-hungry
and war-weary, boat people and jet people, and we are all proud
custodians of the American dream.

<HEAD>NEW ORLEANS: American dream.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The American dream belongs to you and nobody can take it away
from you. The work of this crucial 1988 campaign is to advance that
dream by realistic progress, not by promises; by continuing
leadership that has brought America closer to peace in the world
and full prosperity at home.
   The task before us as Republicans is to show that we stand for
something. We stand for individual freedom, for equal justice and
opportunity, and for safety at home and peace in the world. We
believe that government exists to serve not only the worthy causes
of all minorities but also to safeguard the rights and legitimate
interests of the majority.
   We believe that a government big enough to give you everything
you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you
have.
   Do we really want to go back to the days of spend and spend, tax
and tax _ a government in Washington with its head in the clouds
and its hand in your pocket?
   I can put it no plainer than this: This year's Democratic ticket
is a tax increase on its way to happen.
   Under President Reagan we've cut, cut taxes, kept inflation
under control and come as close to full employment as we are likely
to get in peacetime. And we are in peacetime. That's performance,
not promises.
   Can we continue this performance with George Bush in the White
House and more Republicans in the Congress? You bet we will.
   We Republicans stand for more, not less, individual freedom.
Fewer bureaucrats bungling up the works. More freedom to keep what
we've worked for, freedom from the cruel head tax of inflation.
   Do we really want to go back to all the Democrat economic misery
from 1977 to 1981? Interest rates 21 percent. Inflation 13 percent.
   No, not even the professional Democrats want to go back to such
economic misery. They claim they've seen the light, changed their
ways, and want us to believe that this campaign is not about
ideology, but about competence.
   Competence? When you look at the competence of the two or three
gentlemen who now speak for the Democrats, where is their
experience in foreign affairs? Only Reverend Jackson has shown much
interest in it.

   I have to admit that my friend Lloyd Bentsen _ we came to the
Congress together in 1948 _ is pretty solid on defense matters. But
his partners can't seem to get their act together.
   I wish you lots and lots of luck, Lloyd, you're going to need it.
   Governor Dukakis says you'll be the kind of vice president who
will march into the Oval Office and tell him: ``Mr. President, that
is a perfectly ridiculous policy.'' Lloyd, with all the differences
between the Democratic leaders, why wait? Speak up now.
   When Governor Dukakis says he'll cut back on American military
strength that has brought the Soviets to the negotiating table for
the reduction of nuclear weapons, Lloyd, educate him now _ not
later.
   Tell him now how jobs are created, who really creates them in
America. The private sector _ not government. It may be your only
chance. Don't wait, Lloyd, speak up now.
   Now, some other speaker at the Democratic Convention _ I don't
remember his name _ asked the rhetorical question: ``Where was
George?''
   A fair question _ deserves a fair answer. I know the answer.
   I know where George Bush was during the Second World War. George
was there.
   We were both out there in the Pacific Ocean fighting to win it.
I was on an aircraft carrier and George was flying fighter planes
off another, courageously winning the Distinguished Flying Cross
and three Air Medals in combat.
   I know where George Bush was in 1966. I flew down to Texas,
campaigned for him. He won. When George came to the House of
Representatives as a freshman congressman, I was the new House
Republican leader.
   I was so impressed with the integrity and ability of George Bush
I saw to it that he was assigned to the Committee on Ways and
Means, a very rare honor for a freshman.
   Now that's not the committee of Congress that spends your money;
that's the one that worries how to find it. So George learned all
about taxes and budgets in a hard school, and we know where George
Bush stands on that issue.
   I know where George Bush was in 1971 and '72. He was at the
United Nations, battling once more for his country, working for
peace. George was there speaking up loud and clear for the United
States of America.

   I know where George Bush was in 1973 and '74. I was vice
president and he was chairman of the Republican National Committee,
during one of the most difficult periods in our party's history.
   George was there. He came out of this character-testing without
a mark on him and with a profound understanding of our national
political process from the courthouse to the statehouse to the
White House.
   When I asked George to be our representative in the People's
Republic of China, he recommended as his successor the first woman
national chairman of either party in our history _ Mary Louise
Smith of Iowa. So we also know where George Bush stands on equal
opportunity for women.
   I know where George was on Dec. 1, 1975. He and Barbara greeted
Betty and me in Beijing on a critical state visit. I learned first
hand how the Bushes had won the affection of the Chinese people as
well as the respect of the Chinese leadership during the internal
struggles that followed the death of Chairman Mao.
   I know where George was during my last year as president. I
brought him home to be my director of the Central Intelligence
Agency. The CIA had been wracked by serious charges. Its dedicated
people were demoralized; George Bush took charge fast. His
leadership put this essential agency firmly onto a responsible new
course.
   And where was, and where was George Bush in all the years
between? Right where most other Americans were, making a living,
raising a loving family, meeting a payroll, helping his community,
paying his taxes and his debts. I ask you, what's wrong with those
credentials?
   I know, we all know, where George Bush has been for the last
eight years. In 1980, he was running for president. He finished
second for our nomination, but became the winner's choice for vice
presidency. And that was one of President Reagan's best decisions.
   Now, I know a thing or two about the vice presidency. It's not
an easy job. Thomas Jefferson called it ``a splendid misery.'' But
like most of life's challenges, you can learn a lot from being vice
president.
   I held that office eight months; George Bush for eight years. We
carried out our constitutional chores with loyalty to the
presidency and trust in the American people. For that superb job,
George Bush, I salute you. And the American people salute you.
   So where was George? For 45 years, George Bush has been at the
center of the action in the service of this great republic.
   I'll be damned if I will stand and let anyone with a smirk and a
sneer discredit the honor, service, accountability and competence
of George Bush.
   If the three Democratic standard-bearers in this campaign think
it is about competence, let any one of them _ or all three of them
put together _ top the demonstrated competence of George Bush.
   If our fellow countrymen think this campaign is about change,
let them think long and hard about what they got the last time they
voted for change with Democrats without experience. We cannot
afford to make the same mistake again.
   We Republicans, we Republicans are not perfect. We make
mistakes, some of them lulus. But we stand for something. Our
candidate, George Bush, stands for something. He's been there.
   My fellow citizens, I'm going to work my heart out to make
George Bush the next president of the United States. George Bush
was there when I needed him. George Bush was there when America
needed him.
   And I know where George Bush will be in 1989 _ right there in
the White House where we all need him.
   Thank you and God bless you.

<HEAD>Rebels Claim To Kill Hundreds Of Soviets At Garrison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas claimed today that
they killed 500 Soviets soldiers in an attack on a garrison and
ammunition dump near the Red Army's evacuation route in northern
Afghanistan.
   Masood Khalili, spokesman for the Jamiat-i-Islami Moslem
Revolutionaries, said 200 other Soviets troops were wounded when
guerrillas fired eight rockets into the Khalagay base in Baghlan
province at midday on Friday.
   Western diplomatic sources in Islamabad said they had
conflicting reports of attacks on the garrison, by different groups
on different days.
   Rival guerrilla groups had reported last weekend that they
started a fire at a fuel storage facility at the base.
   ``I think the figure sounds high,'' said one Western diplomat on
condition of anonymity. He said that if accurate, it would be the
Red Army's worst single loss since it intervened in the Afghan
civil war in December 1979 to back a pro-Soviet regime in Kabul.
   Khalili said the rockets touched off a fire that burned for two
days and destroyed 250 fighting vehicles. He said news of the
attack came from forces under Jamiat's famed commander Ahmad Shah
Masood, who controls much of northern Afghanistan.
   Masood is widely reported to have agreed not to attack Soviet
troops, who have just passed the numerical halfway point in their
scheduled nine-month withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   ``These (troops) were not withdrawing. They were on the base,''
Khalili said.
   Khlagay, about 90 miles south of the Soviet border, lies near a
fork in the main northbound land route for withdrawing Soviet
forces.
   The shorter, north fork reportedly is cut in two places by
insurgents. Red Army forces have been using the northwest fork,
which follows major oil and natural gas pipelines running from
Kabul to the Soviet Union.
   In New York, meanwhile, a U.N. official said Soviet troops have
left 10 of their 18 main garrisons in Afghanistan and are
withdrawing from the country according to the schedule worked out
under a U.N. accord.
   The U.N.-mediated Geneva Accords specify that one-half of the
Soviet contingent of more than 100,000 troops be out by Aug. 15.
The rest are to be gone by Feb. 15.
   Francois Giuliani, spokesman for Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar, did not specify the number of troops that have been
withdrawn.
   In a press briefing Tuesday, he said that on May 15, Soviet
troops were present in 18 main garrisons in 17 of 31 Afghan
provinces.
   As of Aug. 7, the Soviets had evacuated 10 garrisons and handed
over to Afghan government forces, said Giuliani, adding that they
were located at at Baraki, Daulatabad, Faizabad, Gardez, Gazni,
Jalalabad, Kandahar, Kunduz, Lashkargah and Ruha.
   After Monday, eight main garrisons remained under control of
Soviet troops, he said. They are in the provinces of Baghlan,
Herat, Kabul, Parwan and Samangan. In the Balx Province, there will
be some Soviet troops around Hayratan that will be used as a border
crossing point.
   The United Nations has been charged with monitoring and
verifying the Soviet troop withdrawal.
   The Moslem guerrillas, who receive aid from the United States,
rejected the U.N.-mediated accords and vow to continue fighting
until the Soviet-installed Afghan government is toppled.

<TEXT>
   Government and labor leaders have agreed on a
plan to settle a monthlong mining strike that nearly paralyzed
Peru's vital silver industry.
   Prime Minister Armando Villanueva and Valetin Pacho,
secretary-general of the General Confederation of Peruvian Workers,
said late Tuesday that a tentative agreement had been reached to
end the strike, which began July 18.
   Details of the settlement were not disclosed. It was unclear
when or if miners would return to work.
   The National Federation of Mine, Metal and Steel Workers called
the strike to demand unified labor contracts for all unionized
miners. The federation claims to represent 75 percent of Peru's
estimated 80,000 to 100,000 mine workers.
   The federation said more than 90 percent of the mining industry
was affected the strike. Industry analysts said the figure was
closer to 60 percent.
   The strike affected mineral mines in general, but hit the silver
industry particularly hard. Peru is the world's second leading
producer of silver behind Mexico. It is also a major source of
copper, lead, zinc and gold.
   Mining traditionally accounts for half of Peru's exports. Total
mineral exports last year were $1.2 billion, with silver accounting
for $300 million.

   Former Sen. Paula Hawkins of Florida, who has
recovered from a back injury which threatened to make her an
invalid, is feeling so good she's talking about running for
elective office again.
   Mrs. Hawkins, who was Florida's most prominent Republican
officeholder for more than a decade before her loss to former Gov.
Bob Graham in the 1986 Senate race, said she would prefer staying
in Florida to returning to Washington.
   ``I've been elected three times in Florida statewide and people
remember that,'' she said. ``I like serving.''
   The Republican National Convention has been a coming out of
sorts for the 61-year-old grandmother, who spent most of 1987
recovering from a series of operations to correct a chronic back
problem.
   ``The voters did me a great favor,'' Mrs. Hawkins said. ``They

   For a brief, comical moment, Adeline
MacDermid thought George Bush was beckoning her to the podium
Tuesday when he announced his choice for a running mate.
   But it turned out that Mrs. MacDermid, of Plymouth, Conn., just
happened to be standing next to 41-year-old Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana, the man Bush named as his choice for the Republican
nominee for vice president.
   Bush made the announcement while standing on the banks of the
Mississippi River after he arrived in town by riverboat for the
Republican National Convention. Mrs. MacDermid, an alternate
delegate, was standing in the fenced-off section for delegates and
guests.
   ``All of a sudden we saw Vice President George Bush and I think
it was a Secret Service man pointing in our direction,'' Mrs.

<HEAD>Companies Scramble, Produce Bush-Quayle Buttons Within Hours</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Enterprising entrepreneurs had Bush-Quayle
political buttons on the streets within hours of George Bush's
surprise announcement that Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle was his running
mate on the GOP ticket.
   A man from Dallas, who refused to give his name, printed up the
first Bush-Quayle buttons Tuesday, beating the several button
companies doing GOP convention business.
   Bush announced Quayle as his choice about 4 p.m. CDT and the
simple white buttons with red letters saying ``Bush-Quayle'' were
sold by 5:30 p.m. on consignment to the Horn of Plenty Store.
   ``I don't have any company. I just knew of a fellow in the
French Quarter who had the capacity to put these out and voila!,''
said the Dallas man, who was identified by Horn of Plenty clerks as
the quick supplier of the buttons.
   
   More elaborate buttons, 200 bearing Quayle's photo, went on sale
at 9:45 p.m. at Political Americana Ltd., where clerk Megan Warlick
said 25 were sold at $10 each within the first 15 minutes. Several
hundred buttons were sold at $5 each within a few hours.

<HEAD>Bay State Republicans Step Up Anti-Dukakis Efforts At Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Republicans have stepped up
their ``truth squad'' assaults on Michael Dukakis, releasing a
video attacking the governor and displaying huge anti-Dukakis signs
on the convention floor.
   State Party Chairman Ray Shamie released the 10-minute tape
Tuesday at an afternoon reception. The video juxtaposes segments of
the Massachusetts governor's acceptance speech last month in
Atlanta at the Democratic National Convention with local
Republicans, each taking on separate topics.
   The tape attacks Dukakis on the loss of manufacturing jobs in
the state, which regularly has among the lowest unemployment
figures in the nation, a controversial policy implemented by a
predecessor that allowed furloughs for some convicted killers, the
state's fiscal woes, pollution in Boston Harbor and problems
involving Dukakis administration officials.
   At the Louisiana Superdome, where the convention is being held,
delegates held up 6-by-12-foot signs lambasting the governor on
such issues as the state budget problems. Off the floor, state
Republicans played the tape for passing delegates and distributed
anti-Dukakis materials.

<TEXT>
   Panhandling windshield washers often intimidate
drivers, going so far as to smack a car window if they don't get
money for their unsolicited services, says Mayor Edward I. Koch,
who wants to regulate them.
   ``I believe they're horrible,'' Koch said Tuesday. ``We're going
to address this issue. It's a police issue.''
   The mayor, who drew criticism recently when he urged people not
to give money to beggars, predicted his move against the windshield
washers will bring him more flak.
   The windshield washers, who have proliferated in recent years,
stand at busy street corners and rush out uninvited to clean the
front windows of cars that stop for lights. They then ask for a tip.
   Many motorists complain that the washers use filthy rags and
leave the glass streaked and dirtier than before. There have been
some incidents of violence by windshield washers when motorists
refused to pay them.
   Koch said he was concerned about intimidation by the washers.
   ``Suddenly, if three or four guys descend on your car and
without asking you they start to polish it up with dirty rags and
filthy squeegees and dirty water and you say to yourself, `I don't
want it', but you can't stop it, what are you going to do, fight
with these guys?''
   Koch said he did not know if it was a crime to wash windshields
when not asked to, but if the panhandler intimidates the driver or
passengers, it might be a form of harassment.

<HEAD>WWII Veteran Returns Medals To Protest Japanese-American
Reparations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENBROOK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government should have stopped
short of paying reparations to Japanese-Americans interned during
World War II, says one war veteran who has turned in his Army
medals to protest the decision.
   ``I personally think that a verbal apology would have been
enough for these people,'' said Frank Gonzol, of Middlesex Borough.
   The retired 69-year-old mechanic turned in his 11 medals and
accreditations to the office of Rep. Matthew Rinaldo despite
efforts by Rinaldo's staff to dissuade him, said Robert DeLazaro,
an aide to the Republican congressman.
   Rinaldo, who voted in favor of the reparations, represents
Gonzol's district.
   Gonzol said he served from 1942-45 and saw combat action in
Africa, Sicily and other parts of Europe.
   The reparations signed last week by Presdient Reagan authorizes
tax-free payments of $20,000 to each of the approximately 60,000
surviving Japanese-Americans who were placed in camps during the
war.

   Friends, family members and others touched
by the crash of Northwest Flight 255 gathered a year later on a
grassy hillside at the crash site to remember the 156 victims.
   ``Of all the days in the past year, this may be one of the worst
for you who have lost your loved ones,'' the Rev. Ron Lund, pastor
of Bethany Lutheran Church in Roseville, told about 1,000 people at
the Tuesday night observance near Detroit Metropolitan Airport.
   ``It is a very special night, a night of remembrance, a night of
sadness, a night of knowing that Flight 255 is in the arms of God
tonight,'' he said.
   ``Where else could we be today?'' asked Betty Polec of Mount
Clemens, whose daughter and son-in-law died in the Aug. 16, 1987,
crash _ the nation's second-worst air disaster. She co-founded a
support group for the victims' relatives.
   Relatives, friends and a few people unknown to the victims stood
next to 156 plastic foam hearts arranged to form the numeral 255.
Each bore an artificial rose and a ribbon with a victim's name;
flowers were laid at some of them.
   Aircraft roared overhead as Lund pointed out a wispy pink cloud
in the shape of a dove _ the symbol adopted by the support group _
in the darkening sky.
   ``If you don't believe in miracles, look ... and see the dove in
the air,'' he said.
   At 7:46 p.m. _ the hour and minute of the crash _ the names of
the victims were read. As each name was called out, tiny penlights
were turned on and held up until they formed ``255'' in the
gathering darkness.
   The Phoenix-bound MD-80 aircraft broke apart in flames less than
a minute after takeoff from Metropolitan Airport. Two people on the
ground and all but one of the 155 people aboard the plane died.
   The only survivor was Cecelia Cichan, 4, of Tempe, Ariz., whose
parents and brother died in the crash. No Cichan family members
were present Tuesday. They were represented by two employees at the
University of Michigan Medical Center, where Cecelia spent 68 days
recovering.
   Cecelia is living with an aunt and uncle in Birmingham, Ala.
   ``I'm sure their thoughts are going to be with everyone here,''
said Catherine Cureton, a hospital spokeswoman.
   Also on hand was Allison Maus of Las Vegas, Nev., the widow of
the plane's pilot, John Maus.
   Although investigators linked the crash to pilot error, Mrs.
Maus said she has been comforted by relatives of the passengers.
   ``There was never any peace to be made. They all realize my
husband was killed, just like their family and friends, and I
consider them my very dear friends,'' she said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board issued a finding May 10
that Flight 255's two pilots failed to set the airplane's flaps
properly.
   Attorneys have filed 106 lawsuits over the crash, and 10
settlements have been reached.

<HEAD>Police Plan to Pursue Gunmen Backfires When Pair Seizes
High-Powered BMW</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLADBECK, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police plans to pursue two bank
robbers who fled with hostages and a small fortune in a getaway car
provided by authorities backfired when the pair commandeered a
high-powered BMW, officials said today.
   Authorities said they provided the first automobile and the bulk
of the 420,000 marks ($227,000) the robbers demanded to prevent any
harm to the two captive bank employees, and had planned to pursue
the getaway car.
   Then, in a statement issued 24 hours after the robbery began,
police in Gladbeck said they had ``lost contact with the gunmen and
their victims.''
   The statement said the bank robbers switched cars twice after
fleeing the scene with their hostages late Tuesday.
   In the first, the gunmen rushed into a restaurant and demanded
the keys to a high-powered BMW, which they used as part of the
escape. Details of the second car change were not included in the
police statment, which added that the fugitives presumably had left
the Gladeck area in central Germany.
   The gunmen had burst into a bank early Tuesday in this town 50
miles north of Cologne and held police at bay for 14 hours before
fleeing with $65,000 stolen from the bank and an additional
$162,000 provided by authorities.
   ``It doesn't matter whether we give them 300,000 marks or a
million. Our foremost concern is the hostages,'' police spokesman
Klaus Fechner said.
   Fechner said the robbers had threatened to kill their hostages,
a 34-year-old man who worked as a bank teller and a 23-year-old
woman who worked as a customer service representative.
   The gunmen fired warning shots through windows of the building,
but no injuries were reported.
   Negotiators had continued to try to persuade the two gunmen to
surrender, but they refused, demanding the getaway car they
eventually used at the start of the escape.
   Police officials said they had intended to follow the Audi sedan
and arrest the two men, but lost contact after the two car changes.

<TEXT>
   Patrons of John Vinich's Union Bar and
Lounge boisterously celebrated the Democrat's triumph in Wyoming's
hotly contested U.S. Senate primary, but the nominee faces a battle
to unseat Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop in November.
   ``Wyoming people are ready for a change and I think by working
in a grass-roots kind of campaign, Wyoming will be able to make
Malcolm Wallop be a man of his word and limit him to two terms,''
Vinich said over the din of revellers who packed his bar in the
tiny town of Hudson.
   Complete, unofficial returns from Wyoming's primary Tuesday
showed Vinich, a state senator with 14 years' legislative
experience, with 23,165 votes, or 47 percent, in the Democratic
primary.
   University of Wyoming Professor Pete Maxfield ran second, with
14,595 votes, or 30 percent, while state schools Superintendent
Lynn Simons had 11,312 votes, or 23 percent.
   Wallop coasted to his third GOP Senate nomination, amassing
55,696 votes, or 83 percent, with all of Wyoming's 474 precincts
reporting. Wallop's four opponents _ Michael Dee, Russ Hanrahan,
Nora Marie Lewis, and I.W. ``Bud'' Kinney _ did not conduct highly
visible campaigns.
   Twelve years ago Wallop pledged to stay just two terms in the
Senate, but this year he changed his mind, saying that challenges
to Wyoming's way of life, its environment and the state's and the
nation's defense made a third term necessary.
   Official totals in the races likely will differ slightly, as a
federal judge on Tuesday ordered state elections officials to count
any absentee ballots that arrive by the end of business Monday.
   The order stemmed from a Justice Department lawsuit claiming
that the state's 23 county clerks failed to mail the ballots early
enough so they could be returned by primary day.
   However, there were not enough absentee ballots to affect
Vinich's 8,570-vote victory margin.
   The victory will pit a man considered by some to be one of
Wyoming's most liberal politicians against another thought to be
one of the state's most conservative. Vinich spent thousands of
dollars on commercials designed to combat his liberal image.
   Tuesday night, while savoring his victory, Vinich didn't worry
about labels.
   ``I think political labels are just smoke screens that other
candidates like to use when they have nothing else to say,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
   Wallop, 55, issued a brief statement from his campaign
headquarters.
   ``I look forward to informing the people of Wyoming about my
record and continuing the discussion of the issues that face us
today and in the future,'' he said.
   Overshadowed by the Democratic Senate race were the contests for
Wyoming's only U.S. House seat. Democrat Bryan Sharratt ran
unopposed, while five-term incumbent Dick Cheney easily earned his
sixth nomination by outdistancing Jackson's Bob Morris, 59,364 to
8,492.

<HEAD>Continental Blames Crash On Air-Traffic Control, Runway,
Turbulence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Continental Airlines report filed with federal
safety inspectors blames the fatal November crash of a DC-9 at
Stapleton International Airport on wing turbulence, a poorly plowed
runway and air-traffic control errors.
   Flight 1713 crashed upon takeoff during a snowstorm, killing 28
people.
   ``A combination of errors by the city of Denver and air-traffic
control caused the catastrophic crash of Flight 1713,'' the airline
concluded in the report filed last month with the National
Transportation Safety Board, The Rocky Mountain News reported in
today's edition.
   ``The evidence developed to date indicates the crash of Flight
1713 was not caused by mechanical or equipment failure, structural
icing or pilot error,'' the report said. ``Rather, the crash was
caused by the aircraft encountering wing-tip vortices at a critical
phase of flight.''
   A wing-tip vortex is turbulence resulting from an intense eddy
of swirling air that fans out from the wings of airplanes,
particularly wide-body planes.
   In response to Continental's claim that the city did not
completely clear the runway, Stapleton spokesman Richard Boulware
said, ``We reject that categorically. I personally sat in my office
that day and watched airplanes take off from that very runway.
Nobody else had any problem. Why did they? And if Continental did,
the pilot had the option of choosing not to take off.''
   Frank Johns, air-traffic manager at Stapleton, said he hadn't
seen the report. ``So I don't have any specific comments, but we
would probably disagree with those findings.''
   Continental spokesman Bruce Hicks said the NTSB has barred the
airline from releasing the 54-page report, filed July 11, and a
50-page Aug. 5 supplemental document that further argues turbulence
from another airplane caused the crash.
   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said the board will not comment
on the investigation until Sept. 27, when it is expected to
announce its findings in the Nov. 15 crash.
   An Air Line Pilots Association report filed with the NTSB
alleges inadequate aircraft de-icing and incomplete crew training
by Continental caused the crash. The report also said the co-pilot,
Lee Edward Bruecher, mishandled the jet's controls, contributing to
the severity of the crash.
   The 26-year-old co-pilot and pilot Frank Zvonek, 43, were among
those killed.
   In its report, Continental contends turbulence from the wings of
a Delta Boeing 767 that landed on a runway parallel to the one used
by Flight 1713 less than three minutes before takeoff was the
primary cause of the accident.
   Continental also contends the pilots' injuries, and damage to
cockpit controls, indicate Zvonek recognized the ``severity of the
votex-induced loss of control at a critical phase of the flight ...
and assumed control of the aircraft.''
   In addition to turbulence and runway conditions, the Continental
report cited air-traffic controllers for allegedly:
   _Failing to report ``clutter,'' or slush, on the runway and to
request an inspection of the runway.
   _Failing to provide proper spacing between landings and
departures on the parallel runway to avoid turbulence.
   _Failing to properly chart Flight 1713's position prior to
departure, causing a delay of up to seven minutes in takeoff, which
may have affected airplane de-icing.
   _Failing to report wind direction and velocity accurately.

<TEXT>
   China has refused to accredit a reporter from the
Voice of America, the radio network supported by the U.S.
government and which China has criticized for its coverage of
student unrest.
   The Foreign Ministry gave no reason for its refusal to grant
credentials to Max Ruston, 26, saying only ``we find it difficult
to accept Mr. Ruston as a resident correspondent.''
   Ruston is the first reporter in recent years from a major
foreign news organization to be refused accreditation by China.
Ruston, reached in Hong Kong, refused comment on the decision.
   The rejection came more than two months after VOA requested
accreditation for Ruston. The VOA office in Beijing had no
immediate response to the decision.
   It was not clear whether the rejection was linked to China's
harsh criticism of VOA for its reports on pro-democracy student
demonstrations in December 1986 and January 1987.
   The radio network, which broadcasts in both Chinese and English,
was a major source of information for students trying to find out
what was happening on campuses in other parts of the country.
   The official press again lashed out at VOA in June when students
at Beijing University demonstrated and put up posters calling for
more democracy. It quoted an unidentified student as saying VOA was
interested only in bad news about China.
   Ruston, formerly accredited as a local hire for VOA, was in
Shanghai when thousands of students in China's largest city took to
the streets in December 1986. For several days, his reports were
some of the most detailed of the student unrest there.
   Ruston, who is fluent in Mandarin, worked for VOA in Beijing
until mid-1987, when he was transferred to Washington. He has been
reporting from Hong Kong while waiting for approval to take up his
position in Beijing.
   The Foreign Ministry statement made no mention of China's past
displeasure with VOA and said, ``we hope VOA will nominate someone
else.''
   China has expelled three foreign journalists since 1986 on
various charges of violating Chinese security regulations.
   Two of those reporters, an American working for the French news
agency Agence-France Presse and a correspondent for Japan's Kyodo
News Service, were expelled after last year's student
demonstrations and an ensuing conservative campaign against Western
liberal ideas.

   Police today charged 52 students with
leading violent protests during marches supporting reunification
talks with North Korean students.
   Police said the students were accused of violating the National
Security Law or laws banning violent protests.
   Police said about 8,260 people, mostly students, have been taken
into custody since radical students began scattered protests Aug. 7
to press for unification talks with North Korean students.
   North and South Korean students called for the talks in the
border truce village of Panmunjom to mark the Aug. 15 anniversary
of Korea's liberation from Japan in 1945.
   But police, determined to prevent disturbances before the
upcoming Olympics in Seoul, enforced stringent security measures
and blocked all student marches and rallies advocating the border
talks.
   All but 252 detained were released after warnings, with only 200
of them still under investigations, police said.
   Police said 705 policemen and 45 protesters were injured, but
student sources claimed the number of students injured was much
higher.
   The Korean Peninsula has been divided since the end of World War
II between the communist North and the capitalist South.

Allegheny County Jail on charges of violating firearms laws.
   The father, who was identified through fingerprints as Howard
Page, was with the boy, Pittsburgh Police Cmdr. Ronald Freeman said
Tuesday. Page unsuccessfully tried to prevent security guards from
opening the boy's blue nylon knapsack, he said.
   ``The father obviously didn't want the kid to be shoplifting
with all that money on him,'' Freeman said. ``The kid tried to
steal the sunglasses on impulse.''
   Upon discovering the gun and money Monday, security officers
contacted police, who confiscated $121,000 from the bag and $1,741
found on Page. The guards said the boy was trying to steal two
pairs of $40 sunglasses.
   Page, a New York resident who used to live in nearby Braddock,
served six years in an Atlanta prison for bank robbery and has been
arrested in several states on robbery charges.
   New York police said they have arrested Page six times in the
past six years on theft, gambling and narcotics violations. The New
York Police Department has an outstanding arrest warrant for him on
petty larceny charges.
   Freeman said the boy has lived with his mother in Teaneck since
her separation from Page several years ago. Page, he said, had
taken his son to Pittsburgh to visit with relatives.
   The boy was in the custody of the relatives, Freeman said.

<HEAD>Baylor President Cancels Willie Nelson Concert</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS one graf background on Nelson concert picketed last
month in Rhode Island.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A Willie Nelson concert at Baylor University
has been canceled by the Baptist school's president, who said he
was ``concerned for the health and well-being of the American
people.''
   The Nov. 14 concert, which was to be a benefit for depositors of
a failed bank in Leroy, was scheduled to be held on campus.
   When the uninsured Leroy Bank was declared insolvent last
August, about 600 depositors, including many retirees, lost their
savings.
   ``Baylor University sympathizes greatly with those in the Leroy,
Texas, community where bank deposits have been lost, but our
concern for the health and well-being of the American people is an
overriding one,'' Baylor President Herbert Reynolds said in a
statement Tuesday.
   Reynolds also said he hopes Nelson will use his strong influence
``to strengthen the moral fiber of our nation.''
   Reynolds refused to discuss his specific concerns.
   ``I'm leaving that to the inference of the readers,'' he told
The Associated Press.
   Concert promoter Tom Gresham said he planned to meet with Nelson
today to discuss having the concert at another location on the same
date. He would not say what reason Baylor officials gave him for
the concert's cancellation.
   ``Willie is a singer and an entertainer. He is not a politician
or a preacher. No one should confuse that,'' Gresham said. ``His
offer to help the people of that community was from the heart.''
   Last month, a Nelson concert in Providence, R.I., was picketed
by more than 400 police officers and their supporters because of a
benefit concert he gave for a man convicted of killing two FBI
agents in South Dakota in 1975. Police withdrew their pickets the
next day after Nelson said he would stage a benefit concert Aug. 23
in Springfield, Mass., for both American Indian and police causes.

<HEAD>Justice Minister Says He's Concerned Over Mandela's Health</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The minister of justice said
he is disturbed by reports that imprisoned black leader Nelson
Mandela is suffering from tuberculosis and that his condition is
deteriorating.
   The reports about Mandela's health have renewed speculation in
South African newspapers that the government might consider
releasing the 70-year-old African National Congress leader from
prison. But there was no official response to questions on the
subject.
   Mandela, who has been in prison since 1962, is serving a life
term for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the white-led
government.
   The office of President P.W. Botha said today the matter of
clemency is the responsibility of the Justice Department.
   Botha in 1986 suggested Mandela could be released if he
renounced violence. Mandela said he will do so only if the order
banning the ANC is lifted and apartheid _ South Africa's form of
racial separation _ is dismantled.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee issued a statement late Tuesday
night saying, ``I have taken cognizance of the various reports and
medical bulletins concerning Mr. Nelson Mandela's condition and am
deeply perturbed by them. The entire issue, as well as steps to
ensure a speedy recovery, are receiving my personal attention.''
   Coetsee's office said the minister was going today to Durban,
where Botha is to give an address Thursday night to the governing
National Party's provincial congress in Natal. It didn't give the
purpose of Coetsee's trip.
   Neither the government nor doctors at Tygerberg Hospital in Cape
Town where Mandela was taken on Aug. 5 have said Mandela has
tuberculosis.
   Doctors say Mandela has an inflamed left lung and is in
satisfactory condition following removal of a drainage tube from
the lung. The medical superintendent of the hospital, Dr. J.G.L.
Strauss, said Mandela has been ``steadily improving since his
admission.''
   But Mandela's attorney, Ismail Ayob, told reporters Tuesday that
Mandela was suffering from the disease and has been bedridden for
nearly two weeks.
   ``His condition has been deteriorating for some time,'' Ayob
said. ``He was short of breath, he had a persistent cough, his
speech had been impaired and by last Friday he had lost his voice
completely.''
   News of Mandela's illness spurred renewed appeals within South
Africa for his release. Two Johannesburg newspapers urged the
government to avoid the possibility he might die in Pollsmoor
Prison.
   ``Living in jail, he is a symbol of resistance,'' said Business
Day. ``Dead in detention, no matter how natural the causes, he
would be a martyr, a flame to ignite the fires of anger,
condemnation and anti-South African action around the world.''
   The Star, the country's largest-selling daily, said Mandela's
illness offers the government ``a face-saving opportunity ... to
start the process of dealing with Mandela the man, rather than
Mandela the unknown and fearful myth.''
   In England, anti-apartheid campaigners again called for
Mandela's release. Dr. Trevor Huddleston, a former Anglican
archbishop and president of the Anti-Apartheid Movement in Britain,
appealed to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ``to intervene
personally'' to try to secure Mandela's freedom.
   Tuberculosis, which causes fatigue, fever, weight loss,
coughing, hoarseness and chest pain, is a contagious bacterial
infection that can be disabling or fatal. It responds to treatment
with drugs. Relapses of latent infection often occur among older
people.

<HEAD>Bombs Explode, Militias Fight Before Parliament Elects President</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five bombs exploded in west Beirut two
days before Parliament was scheduled to elect a new national
president, and Druse and Christian militiamen battled southeast of
the capital, police said today.
   Police said one person was killed and four wounded in the
militias' overnight exchange of mortars and rockets.
   The violence began a few hours after former President Suleiman
Franjieh, a Christian leader backed by Syria, announced Tuesday he
will run for president.
   On Thursday, Parliament planned to meet in Beirut to elect a
successor to President Amin Gemayel, whose six-year term expires
Sept. 23.
   A police spokesman said the bombs exploded late Tuesday within
two hours in five residential districts of Moslem west Beirut. They
caused damage, but no casualties were reported.
   Gunmen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist
Party and their right-wing Christian foes, the Lebanese Forces,
fought in the hills of Kfarshima southeast of Beirut for three
hours.
   They stopped after a committee grouping representatives of the
various Lebanese militias called a cease-fire at 3:15 a.m., said
the police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Franjieh, 78, is a personal friend of Syrian President Hafez
Assad. The Lebanese Forces, which opposes Syria, urged Parliament
not to elect a man ``who bears grudges and whose accession to power
would touch off the war anew.''
   It called for a ``reconciliatory president who could lead the
nation out of its current impasse and bring about national
entente.''
   The statement did not say whether the Lebanese Forces will fight
to prevent the election of Franjieh, who was president when the
civil war broke out in April 1975.
   The war, which has claimed more than 130,000 lives and shattered
the nation's economy, forced Franjieh to request Syria's military
intervention in Lebanon in 1976.
   Many Lebanese Christian leaders see Franjieh's candidacy as an
attempt by Syria to extend its control over Lebanon.
   Syria maintains about 40,000 troops in northern and eastern
Lebanon and in west and south Beirut.
   In Israel, a senior government official said Israel will
withdraw its forces from southern Lebanon if a strong, independent
president is elected.
   A Syrian-controlled president would plunge Lebanon into ``an
ongoing state of turmoil,'' said Uri Lubrani, coordinator of
government policy on Lebanon. He said Israel had ongoing private
and public contacts with various groups, not just its traditional
Christian allies.
   Israel maintains about 1,000 soldiers in a self-declared
security zone six to 10 miles deep in south Lebanon.
   Lebanon's 99-seat Parliament was elected to a four-year term in
1972. Since then, 22 deputies have died. Gemayel's seat became
vacant when he was elected president in 1982, leaving only 76
surviving parliamentarians.
   The civil war has prevented parliamentary elections, and the
legislature has been extending its mandate since 1976.
   According to an unwritten national covenant, Lebanon's president
should be a Maronite Catholic, house speaker a Shiite Moslem and
prime minister a Sunni Moslem. Gemayel is forbidden by law from
seeking a second term.

<HEAD>Horse That Collapsed From Heat Becomes Celebrity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 9-year-old carriage horse that collapsed on a
Manhattan street this week, apparently from heat prostration, has
become something of a cause celebre, whether he knows it or not.
   Several protestors afraid that the gelding's new lease on life
would be a short one arrived at Shamrock Stables on Tuesday, some
carrying signs reading, ``Whitey: From Carriage Horse to
Hamburger.''
   ``He could easily end up as dog food,'' said Peggy Parker,
Carriage Horse Action Committee coordinator.
   Cleveland Amory, who writes a column about animals for the New
York Post, said he offered Whitey's owner, Anthony Haught, $1,000
for the animal, but Haught failed to show for a meeting Tuesday.
   ``We want Whitey to have the rest of his life,'' Amory said.
``He's suffered enough.''
   Haught, who has said he plans to send the horse to a farm in New
Jersey, could not be reached for comment.
   Whitey was on his way back to the stables, as city law requires,
when the temperature reached 90 degrees Sunday. He collapsed just a
few blocks away, but was revived after about two hours after he was
hosed with water and fed intravenously.
   The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
ordered Whitey suspended from working for 30 days. On Tuesday, he
was in the stable resting and, driver Ed Loeffler said, ``wondering
what the hell all the fuss is about.''

<TEXT>
   A 20-year-old man has been sentenced to
three years in prison and ordered to pay restitution to a man whose
nose he bit off during a fight.
   Aaron Witherspoon's prison term was three times that called for
by state sentencing guidelines, but Ramsey County District Judge
Gordon Shumaker said it was justified by the ``particular cruelty''
of the attack.
   The medical expenses of Gary Holter, 41, have exceeded $10,000
and will increase with further reconstructive surgery, Shumaker
said. Holter was in the courtroom Tuesday when Shumaker sentenced
Witherspoon.
   Holter has been unable to work at his construction job since
August 1987 because of the combined effects of earlier back surgery
and his injured nose, according to court records.
   Police said Holter was attacked March 24 by a man he didn't know
who taunted Holter in a grocery store and blocked his way at the
exit. The assailant kicked Holter, who responded with a punch, and
the two fell to the sidewalk scuffling. The man then grabbed
Holter's head, bit off an inch-wide portion of his nose and fled.
   Holter took the severed tip of his nose to St. Paul-Ramsey
Medical Center but doctors told him that it couldn't be reattached.
   Witherspoon was arrested three weeks later. Last June, he
pleaded guilty to second-degree assault involving a dangerous
weapon, his teeth.

<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The father of Sen. Dan Quayle today said
he watched his son ``in the chase, in the hunt'' for the GOP vice
presidential slot but still was surprised when George Bush selected
the Indiana senator.
   ``There's no way to prepare for something like that,'' said
James C. Quayle, whose 41-year-old son got the nod from Bush on
Tuesday as the vice president arrived at the Republican National
Convention.
   The senator's mother, Corinne, said she ``was kind of shocked,
but I'm not sure that I was real surprised.''
   Her impartial assessment: ``I thought he was a good choice.''
   The elder Quayle, interviewed with his wife on ABC-TV's ``Good
Morning America,'' said of the suspense that surrounded the
selection of their son: ``We watched him in the chase, in the hunt,
but you never know until you know.''
   In preceding days, as Dan Quayle's name had been bandied about
as a potential candidate, his father had rated his chances as
``slim to none.''
   But hours later, the senator's parents found their relaxed ranch
house just north of town besieged by reporters and ringing with
telephone calls of congratulations. Suddenly and unexpectedly, they
found themselves being asked to explain how they'd raised the first
Hoosier to wind up on a national ticket since Wendell Willkie in
1940.
   ``Our home was like a lot of homes, kind of raucous sometimes,
with four kids, but it was a very normal, at least I think normal,
home life,'' ventured Mrs. Quayle, 66.
   Jim Quayle, 67, publishes the Huntington Herald-Press, a
newspaper he bought in 1963 from his publisher father-in-law, the
late Eugene Pulliam. He describes himself as a conservative who
wasn't sure about his son's politics when Dan first went to
Washington as a member of the House.
   ``I don't think he's as conservative as I am, but I don't think
he's made a single vote in 12 years that I would challenge,'' the
senior Quayle said.
   The residents of Huntington and the rest of Dan Quayle's
original northeastern Indiana congressional district didn't
challenge his politics either, giving him solid support in each
election campaign.
   By Tuesday evening, the town offered some modest early
recognition of its favorite son's accomplishment. ``Congratulations
Dan Quayle. Huntington is proud of you,'' read the sign outside the
combination bus stop and Western Union Office. ``Congratulations
Dan Quayle'' read another sign outside an insurance office.
   Nearby, historical markers remember people and events little
noted beyond the town limits. One notes its position along the
Wabash and Erie canal, once a link between Lake Erie and the Ohio
River, but defunct before the Civil War. Another commemorates a
19th century U.S. Supreme Court decision, while a third says the
town was named for Samuel Huntington, a signer of the Declaration
of Independence.
   Dan Quayle should be cautious about trying to make his own
historical mark as the No. 2 man on the ticket, his father
cautioned.
   ``It's dangerous. He'd better not try,'' he said. ``He'd better
try to figure out which way Mr. Bush wants to go. It's his dictates
that should be followed. I hope Dan doesn't get any ideas about
going off on his own.''
   The elder Quayle said he held few illusions about the power of
the vice presidency. ``It's like Reagan said about George, I send
him to all the funerals.''
   But he has a clear idea of why Bush chose his son.
   In 1986, Dan Quayle soundly defeated Jill Long in his bid for a
second Senate term. His ability to draw votes against a woman may
have caught the eye of Bush advisers, who worry about the vice
president's weak support among women, said his father. ``The
demographics showed he pulled more women's votes than she did,'' he
said.
   Quayle's youthfulness may draw still more votes, his father
said. ``He's a baby boomer,'' he said.

   A man whose wife is charged with
plotting to kill him pleaded from his hospital bed to have the
charges against her dropped, saying, ``I still love her. I want her
back.''
   Jack Owens, recovering from gunshot wounds to the stomach and
leg suffered in an attack two months ago, sent his plea to Broward
Circuit Judge Thomas M. Coker Jr.
   ``We both made mistakes,'' Owens said Tuesday. ``We have to live
with that ... I think the two of us can be happy, if they'll let
us.''
   The judge denied Owens' request.
   Owens, 40, was shot in his sleep on June 14 in the couple's
apartment. Less than 24 hours later, police arrested his wife of 2{
years, Vicky Owens, and another woman in connection with the
shooting.
   Owens said he was disappointed in the judge's decision.
   ``It doesn't seem right,'' Owens said. ``There's a whole lot of
stuff people don't realize. You have to be married to someone for a
while to understand.''
   Mrs. Owens, 32, and her friend, Elizabeth Perron, 21, face
charges of attempted first-degree murder, criminal conspiracy and
criminal attempt.
   Owens said he would like to see Ms. Perron, who is still in
custody, prosecuted. But he said his wife, who is out on bond, has
suffered enough by spending time in jail.
   ``I do love her,'' Owens said. ``I don't want to lose her.''
   Mrs. Owens told police someone had broken into their apartment
and that she was awakened by the sound of a gun firing. She said
she only recalled seeing a shadowy figure leaving the bedroom,
investigators said.
   But a friend of Ms. Perron's told police the shooting had been
planned, and when police confronted Ms. Perron, she confessed,
police said.
   Ms. Perron also handed over maps of the Owens' apartment, a
letter outlining the plan, and keys to the Owens' apartment. Owens
later identified the handwriting on the letter and maps as his
wife's script, police said.
   ``Vicky kept telling her she was unhappy in her marriage and
they began to conspire,'' said Linda Furnell, a police investigator.

   Former President Gerald R. Ford today said
his speech before the Republican National Convention was designed
to meet head-on the ``snide'' barbs lobbed by some Democrats at
their parley last month.
   Ford, who came to Bush's defense in an address to the convention
Tuesday night, said he was angered by the Democrats' personal
attacks on the vice president.
   ``Some of the peripheral speakers got a little snide,'' he said
in an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' show. ``I
thought that was unfair and unfortunate, I had to meet it head-on.''
   Ford expressed hope that the fall campaign won't turn nasty,
saying: ``There are some legitimate substantive differences of
opinion. The question of competence, the question of change. You
don't have to get into personalities to make your point.''
   In his address to the convention, Ford rebutted the chants of
``Where Was George?'' from the Democratic convention in Atlanta.
   ``For 45 years, George Bush has been at the center of the action
in the service of this great republic,'' Ford said.
   ``I'll be damned if I will stand by and let anyone with a smirk
and a sneer discredit the honor, service, accountability and
competence of George Bush.''
   ``If the ... Democratic standard-bearers in this campaign think
it is about competence, let any one of them ... top the
demonstrated competence of George Bush,'' Ford said.
   In an echo of themes from his losing campaign against Jimmy
Carter in 1976, Ford asked his audience: ``Do we really want to go
back to the days of spend and spend and tax and tax _ of a
government in Washington with its head in the clouds and its hand
in your pocket.
   ``I can put it no plainer than this: This year's Democratic
ticket is a tax increase on its way to happen.''
   In a backhanded slap at Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis, Ford said that Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the Democratic
vice presidential candidate, is ``pretty solid on defense matters.''
   ``But his partners can't seem to get their act together,'' he
said.
   Rhetorically addressing Bentsen, Ford said: ``Gov. Dukakis says
you'll be the kind of vice president who will march into the Oval
Office and tell him: `Mr. President, that is a perfectly ridiculous
policy.'''
   Ford added: ``Lloyd, with all the differences between the
Democratic leaders, why wait? Speak up now.''

   A train derailed and caught fire, killing an
undetermined number of people and injuring 95, Tass and a Soviet
official reported today.
   The official news agency said the Aurora passenger train was
traveling from Leningrad to Moscow when it left the tracks between
the Berezaika and Poplavenets stations north of Moscow at 6:34 p.m.
on Tuesday.
   Anatoly N. Sobin, director of the Leningrad railway station in
Moscow, told The Associated Press the train was carrying 760
passengers when it crashed about 220 miles north of the capital.
   Sobin said in a telephone interview that 95 passengers were
hospitalized in two nearby towns. He said he did not know the
number killed.
   First Deputy Railroad Minister Vladimir Ginko told Tass an exact
count of the victims had not been made. The fire started in the
dining car and spread rapidly, engulfing nearly the entire train,
Tass said.
   Because of difficult road conditions, fire engines could not
reach the burning train and a firefighting train at the scene ran
out of water and had to be refilled before the fire was
extinguished, the agency said.
   Normal railway traffic was restored this morning, and an
investigation team was named, headed by a deputy chairman of the
Council of Ministers, Vladimir Gusev, Tass said.

<HEAD>Kidnappers Free American; Talks On U.S. Bases Recessed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American and his Filipino wife
flew to Manila today aboard a U.S. military plane after Moslem
kidnappers freed them from more than two weeks of captivity on the
southern island of Mindanao.
   Also today, U.S. and Filipino negotiators recessed talks on
American military bases. A joint statement said the talks would
resume next month.
   An American diplomat fetched David Blair Stiffler, 42, a New
York City construction worker, and his wife Elpidia from the
Mindanao city of Iligan, where they spent the night after the
kidnappers released them Tuesday near Lanao Lake in Lanao del Sur
province, 520 miles southeast of Manila.
   The Stifflers went into seclusion in Manila, saying they wanted
to ``rest and get their wits together,'' U.S. Embassy spokesman
Jerry Huchel said.
   The kidnappers, described as renegades of the Moslem separatist
Moro Islamic Liberation Front, had demanded a $7,000 ransom, which
they later lowered to $1,000. Military officials insisted no ransom
was paid.
   Col. Eduardo Resos, army commander in the area, said in a
telephone interview that the armed kidnappers robbed the Stifflers
of about $3,000 worth of cash and valuables after their abduction
July 30.
   Resos said the kidnappers agreed to release the captives after
military threats of reprisal against area villages.
   The Moro Front is one of three Moslem groups fighting for Moslem
rule in Mindanao and other southern islands since 1972.
   In Manila, U.S. and Philippine officials gave no date in
September when the U.S. bases talks will resume.
   The two sides are negotiating terms for the remaining two years
of a 1947 agreement under which the United States maintains Clark
Air Base, Subic Bay naval base and four smaller installations.
   The agreement expires in 1991, and there is growing opposition
in the Philippines to extending the lease.
   Also today, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told reporters the
military is ``closely monitoring'' rightist renegades to prevent a
new coup attempt following calls by the vice president for
President Corazon Aquino to resign.
   On Tuesday, Vice President Salvador Laurel said he would give
Mrs. Aquino one week to respond to his proposal that they both
resign and call new presidential elections. Laurel accused her of
incompetence.
   Mrs. Aquino was swept to power in a February 1986
civilian-military coup that deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.
Marcos lives in exile in Hawaii.

   A man who allegedly threw a hand
grenade at a policeman was arrested after a 15-mile freeway chase
that ended when helicopter-borne police fired at the fleeing car
and a police car rammed it.
   No one was injured in the incident.
   Robert D. Bodily, 33, was held today without bail at the San
Bernardino County Jail for investigation of attempted murder of
police Sgt. Ron Schwenka, said police Sgt. Dan Hernandez.
   Bodily threw a hand grenade at Schwenka on Tuesday night while
the officer was investigating reports of a man firing at a dwelling
and brandishing a shotgun, Hernandez said.
   Bodily also was arrested for investigation of violating a parole
warrant, shooting at an inhabited dwelling, brandishing a firearm,
being an ex-felon in possession of a firearm, possessing
explosives, detonating explosives, transporting explosives without
a permit and detonating explosives with intent to commit injury,
Hernandez said.
   The incident began Tuesday when police received a call reporting
shots had been fired at a retirement complex. A second call, about
45 minutes later, reported the same person brandished a sawed-off
shotgun at another address.
   An hour later, Hernandez said, Schwenka pulled over a car
similar to that involved in the incidents. The suspect held a hand
grenade out the window and pulled the pin, he said. Schwenka tried
to fire at the suspect, but his gun failed, Hernandez said, and the
suspect hurled the grenade as he drove by the officer. However, no
one was hurt by the blast.
   Bodily then drove onto Interstate 215, where deputies in a
sheriff's helicopter fired several shots at his car, hitting the
engine compartment area. Fifteen minutes later, a police car halted
the pursuit by ramming Bodily's car.

   Sen. Dan Quayle brings youth, wealth, golden
good looks and a profoundly combative conservative view of the
world to the 1988 Republican presidential ticket.
   Quayle's age _ 41 _ was the factor George Bush stressed Tuesday
afternoon as he stood on the bank of the Mississippi River and
announced he would ask the Republican National Convention to
nominate ``a man of the future'' to be his vice presidential
running mate.
   The Indiana senator projected youthful enthusiasm and energy as
he strode to Bush's side, punched the air with his fist and urged
the soon-to-be Republican standard bearer to ``Go get 'em.''
   But some Democrats said Quayle's conservatism may provide them
with an opening to attack a record that includes his leadership
this summer in a losing fight to defeat legislation requiring
60-days notice of plant closings and mass layoffs.
   Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen, called
Quayle's selection ``good news.''
   Quayle himself braced for the public scrutiny that is sure to
follow his selection.
   For every vice presidential nominee, Quayle said, ``there are
15,000 journalists who want to grab him by the ankles, turn him
upside down and shake him until something bad comes out.''
   Dan Quayle _ his legal name is James Danforth Quayle _ was born
in Indianapolis on Feb. 4, 1947, a birthdate that makes him the
first member of the ``baby boom'' generation on the presidential
ticket of a major American political party.
   Indiana's junior Republican senator is a Presbyterian and a
member of one of the nation's most prominent publishing families,
the Pulliams. His grandfather was Eugene C. Pulliam, publisher of
the Indianapolis Star and News, the Arizona Republic and the
Phoenix Gazette. Quayle's father, James C. Quayle, is publisher of
the Huntington (Ind.) Herald-Press.
   Quayle invoked his family's philosophy Tuesday as he told
cheering Republicans, many of them apparently surprised at his
selection, that ``my grandfather told me that there is nothing more
important in this country than freedom.''
   Enrolling in 1969 at DePauw University, alma mater of many of
his relatives, Quayle waited on tables at a sorority house for $40
a month.
   After graduating from DePauw in 1969, Quayle went to law school
at Indiana University where he met his wife, Marilyn, also a law
student. They married on Nov. 18, 1972, 10 weeks after their first
date. Quayle received his law degree in 1974.
   The couple has a 14-year-old son, Tucker; a 12-year-old son,
Benjamin; and a 9-year-old daughter, Corinne. The two youngest
children were born after Quayle began his first congressional
campaign in 1976, winning election to the House where he was to
serve Indiana's 4th congressional district for two terms.
   Five months into his second House term, Quayle challenged
Indiana's most prominent Democrat, Sen. Birch Bayh, a veteran
incumbent.
   On election day 1980, Quayle ended Bayh's political career,
winning by a margin of 166,000 votes, 54 percent of the total.
   Six years later, as Democrats were reclaiming the Senate
majority they lost in Ronald Reagan's 1980 landslide, Quayle bucked
the tide and crushed his poorly financed opponent, taking 61
percent of the vote.
   It was in his campaign against Birch Bayh that Quayle acquired
what he still dubs his ``stigma.''
   Voters _ and the Indiana press _ compared his handsome features
and blow-dried hair to the movie-star good looks of a movie star:
Robert Redford.
   Asked about the comparison this week, Quayle brushed his sandy
blond hair with an impatient sweep of his hand and said: ``I've had
that stigma ever since I first ran for the Senate. ... I'd rather
talk about what I stand for than what I look like.''
   Quayle tried to erase that glamor boy image by immersing himself
in his work.
   But in eight years in the Senate he has only rarely appeared at
the edge of the national spotlight, never attaining the level of
recognition and peer respect accorded his senior colleague, Sen.
Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the former chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
   But he has made a mark on the three Senate committees on which
he serves _ Armed Forces, Budget and Labor and Human Resources.
   On the Armed Services Committee, Quayle made himself a
specialist in the NATO alliance. He strongly supported President
Reagan's space-based missile defense system popularly known as Star
Wars. A few weeks ago, he successfully urged the president to veto
this year's defense authorization bill because of its restrictions
on administration arms control policies.
   Quayle does not shy from the intricacies of defense policy. He
has mastered such matters as troop strength, weapons performance
and Soviet military doctrine.
   He attended virtually all of the panel's exhaustive hearings
into the details of the medium-range missile treaty between the
United States and the Soviet Union, expressing great skepticism
even though it had been negotiated by a conservative president.
   Quayle eventually joined the 93-5 majority voting to ratify the
pact.
   In the Labor Committee and on the Senate floor, Quayle was a
leader in the Reagan administration's fight against raising the
minimum wage as well as the plant closing bill.
   Speaking with reporters Tuesday, Quayle said his children were
divided 2-to-1 on whether their father should plunge into the vice
presidential race.
   He said Tucker Quayle was fascinated by the idea while Benjamin
Quayle was persuaded by the thought that the Secret Service agents
protecting the family might help him with his homework.
   But Corinne Quayle didn't like the idea of having her father
away from home for long periods.
   Quayle said she told him, ``Daddy, I really hope George Bush
picks Bob Dole.''

<HEAD>Quayle's Largest Holding Is Newspaper Stock</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS relationship to uncle in 5th graf, The 41</NOTE>

   Dan Quayle, selected for the No. 2 spot on the
Republican presidential ticket, could well be one of the wealthiest
members of Congress. But the Indiana senator lists as his only
substantial asset newspaper stock valued at ``$250,000 and above.''
   If Quayle's stock in the family-controlled Central Newspapers
Inc., headquartered in Indianapolis, were worth $250,000 or so, he
would not be among the estimated one-third of senators who are
millionaires.
   But federal law requires financial disclosure by members of
Congress and other officials of only broad categories. The highest
category for assets is ``$250,000 and above'' _ whether the asset
is worth $250,001 or more than $500 million.
   In addition, the laws do not require that the actual value of an
asset be listed; thus, Quayle's statement uses book value for the
newspaper stock, which probably understates its value dramatically.
   The 41-year-old Quayle is reputed to be in line to inherit
several million dollars worth of stock in the newspaper group,
whose holdings include the Indianapolis Star and Indianapolis News
in Indiana and the Arizona Republic and Phoenix Gazette in Arizona.
His uncle, Eugene Pulliam, is publisher of the newspapers.
   The senator's financial disclosure statement also lists his wife
as owning a block of Central stock, with a book value of $100,001
to $250,000.
   Except for the stock in Central Newspapers, Quayle's only
holdings last year were two retirement accounts totaling a maximum
of $65,000; a bank account worth up to $15,000, and an account in
the House of Representatives credit union of $1,000 to $5,000.
   Quayle still holds the title of vice president and associate
publisher of his hometown paper, the family-run Huntington (Ind.)
Herald-Press. That paper's owner, Huntington Newspapers Inc., paid
him $2,625 in director's fees last year, he reported.
   He listed three growth-oriented mutual fund accounts in the
names of his children, totaling up to $45,000, and a bank account
in the children's names worth between $1,000 and $5,000.
   Like most other members of the Senate, Quayle received thousands
of dollars last year for making speeches to various
special-interest groups. His honoraria, which totaled $49,255, came
from such diverse sources as the Health Industry Manufacturers
Association and the National Stone Association.
   The Indiana senator wrote several articles for pay, including
two for $40 each that he sold to the Indianapolis papers. He wrote
a $1,000 article for the Army & Navy Journal in Washington.
   To meet Senate limitations on income from honoraria, he donated
$14,302 of the earnings to charity.
   Quayle is a member of the Senate's Budget, Armed Services and
Labor and Human Resources committees. Several of his paid speeches
were to groups with a direct interest in the work of those
committees _ a common practice among members of Congress.
   For example, on March 18, 1987, he was paid $2,000 each for
speeches to the National Committee for Quality Health Care, based
in Washington, and Voluntary Hospitals of America Inc., in Irving,
Texas. General Electric Co., a prime defense contractor, paid him
$2,000 for a speech on April 9.
   Quayle, an avid golfer, listed among his income last year a $250
trophy for participating in the Monterey Peninsula golf tournament.
Gifts he received included less than $200 worth of golf apparel for
himself and his wife, Marilyn, for participating in the Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am tournament, and $288 worth of golf
merchandise from the Kemper Open in Potomac, Md.
   The most expensive gift received by Quayle was $825 worth of
golf merchandise from Indiana pro Fuzzy Zoeller.
   Quayle and his wife were reimbursed by AT&T, a sponsor of the
Monterey tournament, for a round-trip flight to the California
tournament. He also listed reimbursements for travel to charity
skiing competitions in Utah and Idaho, and from the U.S. Telephone
Association, Abbott Laboratories, Electronic Industries Association
and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association for trips to
Phoenix; Waukegan, Ill.; Ft. Myers, Fla., and White Sulphur
Springs, W.Va.
   The Quayles' only liability listed on the financial disclosure
form was a 30-year, 5-percent note that Mrs. Quayle signed in 1975
to borrow up to $50,000 from Huntington Newspapers, Inc.

<TEXT>
   An armored truck ran off a highway and
overturned, killing a Wells Fargo guard who was crushed by money
bags and spilling more than $1 million into a ditch, authorities
said.
   The driver apparently fell asleep Tuesday afternoon while
traveling 55 mph on Interstate 85 about two miles south of Archdale
in Randolph County, state trooper Ricky Doss said.
   The truck was carrying money from Greensboro to a bank in
Charlotte when it ran off the highway, crashed into a guard rail,
rolled down an embankment and overturned in a ditch.
   The driver and another guard in the front seat were thrown from
the truck, and more than $1 million in coins and paper currency
spilled out the back door, officials said.
   Firefighters spent two hours bringing large money bags up from
the embankment with a pulley, said Lt. Keith Eddins of the
Guil-Rand Fire Department.
   ``There is no telling how many millions were pulled up,'' Eddins
said. ``They already took one truckful of money away.''
   Officers guarded the money overnight.
   Scott Burger, 22, of Charlotte, was pronounced dead at the
scene, Doss said.
   Driver Donald Carol Greenway, 42, of Charlotte, was in stable
condition today at High Point Regional Hospital. Front seat
passenger Scott Pittsenbarger, 29, of Charlotte was in critical
condition today at North Carolina Memorial Hospital in Chapel Hell.

   Poughkeepsie Town Council members
found one sure way to beat the heat this summer. They outlawed it.
   The council Monday night unanimously passed a resolution making
it illegal to report a temperature over 90 degrees within city
limits.
   Town Alderman Pasqual Letteri, who sponsored the resolution,
declared at the council meeting, ``Whereas the residents of the
city of Poughkeepsie deserve better weather than constant 90-degree
heat, it is hearby outlawed for anyone to report a temperature over
89.5 degrees Fahrenheit.''
   So far, the extreme measure seems to be working. Poughkeepsie
has yet to see the temperature rise above the 90-degree mark since
the adoption of the new resolution.
   And a good thing too. The resolution mandates that anyone caught
violating the law will be banished to the top of the local civic
center's marquee where they will be sentenced to make ice
sculptures until they no longer melt.

   The newest wave of Elvis-is-alive rumors
found an unreceptive audience among many of the Presley faithful
gathered for the 11th anniversary of the singer's death.
   ``The fans don't believe it,'' said Karen Loper, an Elvis fan
club leader from Houston. ``In the fan club newsletters I've read,
everybody is putting it down and laughing about it.''
   The Elvis-lives stories, which crop up from time to time, have
been revived by a newly published book _ ``Is Elvis Alive?'' by
Gail Brewer Giorgia. The book says the singer faked his death as
the only way to get a little privacy.
   He would not have found much privacy this week at his former
Memphis residence, Graceland.
   While crowds for the pilgrimage were noticeably smaller than
those at last year's 10th anniversary, more than 3,000 fans
attended a candlelight procession Monday night past Presley's grave
and a capacity crowd of 4,000 tourists and fans toured Graceland on
Tuesday.
   The single-day record for Graceland attendance is 4,700, which
was set over the Fourth of July weekend.
   Presley was 42 when he died of heart disease at the two-story,
white-columned house on Aug. 16, 1977.
   ``This is the next best thing we're going to get to seeing
Elvis,'' said Graham Knowles, an Elvis fan from Leeds, England, and
a first-time visitor to Graceland.
   Graceland managers, who organize an annual nine-day celebration
called ``Elvis International Tribute Week,'' said fans are upset
over the Elvis-lives book.
   ``It's a sad and cruel exploitation,'' said Jack Soden, general
manager of the Graceland Division of Elvis Presley Enterprises Inc.
   Soden's company runs 600,000 tourists a year through the Presley
residence and brings in $9 million annually at the 32-acre
Graceland complex which includes a 36,000-square-foot souvenir
shopping center.
   Up to 35,000 visitors were expected at Graceland during tribute
week, about the same number that tour the house weekly during the
tourist season. The Elvis tribute week, which includes a variety of
events, is highlighted by a late-night procession past Presley's
grave. The candlelight vigil begins each year on the night of the
15th and runs into the early hours of the 16th.
   Monday night's procession attracted a crowd estimated by police
at 3,000; Graceland estimates for previous vigils have run from
5,000 to 10,000.
   In Tupelo, Miss., more than 2,000 fans visited Presley's
birthplace between Saturday and Tuesday in memory of their idol,
caretakers of the home said. The small, two-room house where
Presley was born Jan. 8, 1935, is about 120 miles southeast of
Memphis.
   Elsewhere, a Beverly Hills, Calif., radio station marked the
11th anniversary of Presley's death by offering a $1 million reward
for proof that the king of rock music is still alive, but only an
impersonator and about 150 fans showed.
   ``How many believe Elvis is still alive?'' KRLA radio disc
jockey Charlie Tuna asked Tuesday as the crowd gathered outside a
diner which serves burgers and malts in '50s tradition.
   He was greeted by applause and cheers from the late
entertainer's fans, but the only Elvis present was impersonator
Paul Boland, 27, wearing a white pantsuit with red and gold
spangles.

   Armed guards were hired to patrol the Drug
Enforcement Administration's Manhattan offices after Colombia's
most powerful cocaine cartel threatened the life of the DEA's New
York chief, a spokesman said.
   Police officers also were assigned to patrol outside the
agency's headquarters, New York Newsday reported today.
   The threat against Robert Stutman, special agent in charge of
the New York DEA office, came last week and was linked to the
Medellin group, headed by cocaine billionaire Gonzalo Rodriguez
Gacha.
   ``Our intelligence indicates that in fact the Medellin cartel is
responsible for the threats,'' said DEA spokesman Robert Strang.
   The threat apparently was prompted by the recent seizure of
7,300 pounds of cocaine and the arrest of three Medellin cartel
members, agents said.

<HEAD>House And Senate Compromise On Anti-Corruption Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT NAYLOR JR.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation approved by Mississippi
lawmakers restructuring the state's century-old system of county
government is historic, Gov. Ray Mabus said.
   ``For the first time, the government of the state of Mississippi
is on record for honest and efficient government,'' Mabus said
after the bill passed 111-7 in the House and 50-0 in the Senate.
   A compromise version of the legislation won overwhelming
approval Tuesday, the seventh day of a special session called by
Mabus to deal with county government reform.
   Mabus, as state auditor for the four years preceding his
election as governor last November, assisted the FBI in an
investigation that resulted in federal graft charges against 56
supervisors from 25 counties.
   House and Senate negotiators reached a compromise Monday
afternoon; both chambers approved the bill Tuesday without debate
after lengthy explanations.
   Negotiators refused to compromise on a similar bill which died
during the regular session earlier this year.
   Lawmakers also sent to Mabus a bill raising supervisors'
salaries by 20 percent across-the-board. Mabus vetoed a similar
bill in the regular session, saying no raises would be given until
county reform legislation was passed.
   A spokesman in Mabus' office said the governor on Tuesday signed
the county unit bill, the pay-raise bill and others passed during
the special session.
   The county unit legislation requires counties to implement by
Jan. 2, 1989 central purchasing, receiving and inventory control
systems with separate clerks for each.
   Voters would decide on Nov. 8 whether their counties would
construct and maintain roads on a countywide or district basis
after Oct. 1, 1989.
   Those counties opting for central road administration would be
required to hire county administrators and road managers. Under the
bill, the chancery clerk could serve either as county administrator
or in one of the clerical positions. Supervisors could not hold any
of those positions.
   Sen. Ollie Mohamed, chairman of the Senate County Affairs
Committee, said the bill had flaws, but they could be fixed in the
regular session in January.
   ``We've been placed under the gun,'' he said. ``Everybody wants
to go home and everybody wants some form of county government
reorganization.''
   Mississippi Association of Supervisors Executive Director Eddie
Washington said he was ``extremely pleased'' with the compromise.
   Already, 22 of Mississippi's 82 counties have in place some form
of the so-called county unit system, under which supervisors set
policy and hire an administrator to handle day-to-day business. In
the remainder, supervisors oversee both policy and daily operations
in their individual districts.

   Rain poured down on the capital today and
the Nile rose higher as the city tried to cope with the worst
flooding in its history.
   News reports today said an additional 21 people died in
accidents caused by the floods, bringing the total known death toll
to more than 90.
   Torrential rains Aug. 4-5 left 1.5 million to 2 million people
homeless as thousands of mud huts melted in the refugee camps that
ring this desert city.
   In Khartoum alone, 70 people died, 213 were injured and nearly
115,000 houses were destroyed by the flooding, Egypt's state-owned
Middle East News Agency quoted Amin Abdel-Latif, Sudan's ambassador
to Cairo, as saying Tuesday.
   The agency said today that 18 Sudanese drowned when their ferry
overturned in fast currents on the Rahad River. The river is a
tributary of the Blue Nile, which joins the White Nile at Khartoum
to form the Nile River.
   In Omdurman, across the Nile from Khartoum, the agency said
three children were killed and dozens injured when a house
collapsed because of the flood.
   In northern Sudan, 99 islands were submerged and their 60,000
inhabitants moved to safe locations, and 21 villages were washed
away and the 12,000 families who lived there were left homeless,
Abdel-Latif said.
   He said there were no figures on total casualties and damages
because the floods isolated so many places.
   Sudanese Finance Minister Omar Nour Dayem earlier estimated
damages were around $200 million and that up to 2 million people
were homeless.
   The crisis could worsen with the beginning of the Nile's annual
flooding. Heavy rains in Ethiopia, source of the Blue Nile, have
produced a plentiful flood after eight years of drought.
   Officials don't know whether the Nile will flood the city, parts
of which are already isolated by vast pools of stagnant water and
roads that have become impassable tracks of mud.
   The Nile waters have already started seeping into houses along
its banks in the capital, and many residents have evacuated their
homes for higher ground.
   The Egyptian agency quoted Sudanese Irrigation Minister Mahmoud
Beshir Gamma as saying several areas in the north were threatened
with river flooding. He said they included the large towns of
Atbara, Damer, Berber and Dongola.
   Gamma also said floods caused by heavy rains in the western
province of Kordofan washed away many houses and left 15,000
families homeless.
   The Middle East News Agency said the large crop-rich island of
Tuti, in the Nile between Khartoum and its twin city Om Durman, was
almost submerged.
   The agency quoted travelers coming from central Sudan and the
Gezira region as saying the annual flood submerged large areas of
land and left 55,000 people destitute.
   Gezira contains the country's richest agricultural lands, which
are mostly planted with cotton, one of the Sudan's most important
exports. Losing the cotton crop would add to the country's economic
woes.
   The World Health Organization in Khartoum has warned of
water-borne epidemics that could kill thousands of peasants, mostly
children, who are cut off from supplies of clean water.
   About 90 planes have brought food, medicine, tents and other
supplies into Khartoum from all over the world, but Sudanese
authorities have had difficulty distributing the aid.

   A high-speed passenger train caught fire and
derailed, killing 17 people on a trip from Leningrad to Moscow,
Soviet media said today.
   Fire engulfed the restaurant car and quickly spread to the
entire line of sleeping cars Tuesday evening about midway between
the Soviet Union's two largest cities, said the government evening
newspaper Izvestia.
   It said that by noon today, 17 people were dead and 106
hospitalized. It said children were among the fatalities, but did
not say how many.
   The Moscow-Leningrad route is one of the busiest in the Soviet
Union and the trains are usually full.
   The train was carrying 760 passengers when it crashed about 190
miles north of the capital, said Anatoly N. Sobin, director of the
Leningrad railway station in Moscow.
   He told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that 95 of
the injured were hospitalized in two towns near the scene of the
accident, Bologoye and Vyshny Volochok.
   Sobin said he did not know the exact death toll from the crash,
but said it was not as deadly as a June 4 explosion aboard a
freight train in the city of Arzamas, 240 miles east of Moscow.
That blast killed nearly 100 people, wounded 200 and forced the
evacuation of 700 families.
   The official Tass news agency said the Moscow-bound Aurora
passenger train left the tracks between the Berezaika and
Poplavenets stations at 6:34 p.m. Tuesday. Izvestia said 15 cars
derailed.
   The cause of the fire and the exact point where it broke out
were still under investigation, but it began shortly before the
train derailed, Izvestia said. Previous reports suggested the fire
broke out after the train derailed.
   The newspaper said firefighting equipment could not approach the
burning cars fast enough because they derailed in swampland. It
also said the first railway water tanker sent to the scene turned
out to be empty and had to be refilled before it could be used by
firefighters.
   Residents of nearby villages, soldiers and civilian emergency
workers rushed to the scene to evacuate the injured and help others
contact relatives, Izvestia said.
   Traffic on the Moscow-Leningrad route was restored by this
morning, and an investigation team was set up and led by a deputy
chairman of the Council of Ministers, Vladimir Gusev, Tass said.
   Disaster reports by Soviet media are still slow in appearing and
often lacking in important details. But today's accounts of the
fatal train derailment less than 24 hours earlier reflect the
closer watch Soviet media have been keeping on public matters under
Communist Party chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
``glasnost,'' or greater openness on selected subjects.

   Beachgoers on the sweltering East Coast
have been surprised to run smack into cold waves along the
mid-Atlantic coast.
   Waters from Virginia to New Jersey are unexpectedly cold, and
lifeguards at the Assateague Island National Seashore in Maryland
report the coldest ocean temperatures in 20 years.
   The chilly waters have frequently forced bathers out of the
water, said Larry G. Points, the park's chief naturalist.
   In Chincoteague, Va., water temperatures plunged to 58 degrees
during the annual wild pony roundup last month, at least 12 degrees
below the normal temperature range.
   Satellite photographs show a band of unusually cold water
extending from just south of Long Island along the New Jersey coast
to Virginia Beach and Norfolk, Va., said Dorothy Kropp, a National
Weather Service meteorologist in Camp Springs, Md.
   Scientists blame the subnormal water temperatures on
``upwelling,'' a natural phenomenon in which warm water is blown
offshore by the wind and replaced by colder water from the ocean
bottom.
   ``It's nothing new, but it's usually not noticeable on the
Eastern seaboard,'' said James A. Eberwine, a National Weather
Service forecaster in Atlantic City, N.J. ``On the July 4 weekend,
we had water temperatures in the 50s. We had to put out an alert
notice for hypothermia. People just can't believe it.''

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Sueddeutsche Zeitung of Munich (left-leaning): ``They didn't

<TEXT>
   Investigators following an anonymous tip
found $26.4 million worth of cocaine at a suspected suburban
``stash'' house where they also arrested four suspects, authorities
said.
   Sheriff's deputies found 194 pounds of cocaine in a station
wagon in the garage during the raid Monday night at a home in
Northridge, 25 miles north of downtown, sheriff's Lt. Bill
Christiansen said. An Uzi semiautomatic machine gun and $3,000 in
cash also were found, he said.
   ``It is a significant seizure,'' Christiansen said. ``They
normally come after longer investigations and certainly more
information.''
   Officials said the four occupants of the house were arrested for
investigation of conspiring to distribute cocaine and held in the
county jail in lieu of $1 million bail each.
   The Sheriff's Department began its investigation Monday morning
when the department's narcotics unit received an anonymous call
saying a large amount of cocaine was to be moved from the home that
day, Christiansen said.
   The deputies, armed with a search warrant, raided the house
after they saw a man moving packages they believed contained
cocaine into the station wagon, he said.
   Authorities believe the home was being used as a storage point
for drugs planned for distribution in the Los Angeles area. Police
said they did not know whether any of the suspects actually lived
at the house.
   Deputies said they didn't know where the cocaine came from or
where it was to be delivered. They also said they had no clues to
the identity or motives of the anonymous tipster.

<TEXT>
   North Korea today said it would meet
with South Korean delegates Friday to prepare for a joint
parliamentary session on a non-aggression pact and the North's
demand to co-host the Olympics.
   South Korea's National Assembly said North Korea's Supreme
People's Assembly agreed in a telephone message to send five
delegates to the truce village of Panmunjom on Friday. It would be
the first time in nearly three years that the two Koreas have met
face-to-face.
   Both sides last met in December 1985 at Red Cross talks at
Panmunjom. But the North shelved all inter-Korea dialogue in early
1986 to protest regular joint military exercises between South
Korea and the United States.
   The latest peace overtures began July 21, when the North
proposed that a joint session of the parliaments draft a
non-aggression pact. It later proposed that they discuss the
Olympics, which open Sept. 17 in Seoul.
   North Korea has said it will boycott the Olympics unless it is
allowed to co-host them. South Korea and international Olympic
officials have rejected the demand because the Games are awarded
only to one city.
   North Korea had proposed the meeting for today, but the South
suggested moving it to Friday so it wouldn't interfere with
celebrations marking 30 days before the Olympics begin.
   An assembly source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
North's message today did not mention its earlier demand for
full-fledged parliamentary talks. The two sides have disagreed over
the North's demand to include representatives of all walks of life
in the main legislative conference.
   The North also insists Friday's meeting should discuss only
logistical arrangements for main talks. But the South wants to take
up all basic and procedural matters, including the agenda and the
size of full negotiations.
   The disagreement cast doubts on the prospects of full
parliamentary talks between the two Koreas, which were divided in
1945 at the end of World War II and which fought the Korean War
from 1950 to 1953.
   Some South Korean government officials said North Korea may have
agreed to the preliminary talks in an attempt to stir unrest before
the Olympics or to find an excuse to boycott the Olympics.
   But South Korea's opposition parties welcomed the North's
agreement.
   ``We hope the South-North parliamentary talks would provide an
opportunity for realizing national unification,'' said a message
from the main opposition Party for Peace and Democracy.
   The proposed parliamentary talks could involve nearly 600
lawmakers from communist North Korea and capitalist South Korea.
   The North's offiical Korean Central News Agency, in a report
monitored in Tokyo, said the North's delegation to Friday's talks
would be headed by Chon Gum Chol, representative of the communist
Worker's Party and the Supreme People's Assembly.
   South Korea's National Assembly has named Park Joon-kyu, a
senior member of the governing Democratic Justice Party, to head
its five-member delegation, which also includes members of the
three main opposition parties and one other member of the governing
party.
   On Tuesday, North Korea rejected the International Olympic
Committee's latest compromise proposal that the two Koreas march
side-by-side at the opening and closing ceremonies.
   North Korea sees the awarding of the Games to Seoul and a
successful staging of the Olympiad as a major victory for its
rival. It also has argued that letting Seoul alone host the games
will bring world recognition of a divided Korean peninsula and
further delay reunification.

   A mother is appealing a federal judge's order
that a 6-year-old AIDS victim stay inside a glass booth if she
attends a school for handicapped children.
   Steve Hanlon, attorney for Rosa Martinez, said he filed notice
of appeal Tuesday, taking the case to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Atlanta. He said he doubts the matter could be
resolved before school starts Aug. 29.
   ``We were hopeful the judge's solution might work,'' Hanlon
said. ``But after talking with pediatric and psychological experts
_ people whose judgments we respect a great deal _ we are convinced
it would be very harmful, even to the extent of affecting her
immune system.''
   Mrs. Martinez filed suit last year, saying she wanted her
adopted daughter Eliana to be in a classroom setting.
   Last week, U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich ruled that
the Hillsborough County School Board must admit the mentally
handicapped child to Manhattan Exceptional Center.
   The child was to remain inside a plexiglass enclosure until she
became toilet-trained and learned to stop sucking her thumb and
forefingers, according to the order.
   School officials had wanted to have the girl instructed at home.
   Doctors believe Eliana contracted from multiple blood
transfusions following her premature birth in Puerto Rico.

<TEXT>
   Police today arrested 15
right-wing Italians carrying banners with swastikas in the town
where former Nazi leader Rudolf Hess is buried.
   Demonstrations are banned in Wunsiedel on the first anniversary
of Hess' death. The former deputy fuhrer hanged himself at the age
of 93 in Berlin's Spandau Prison on Aug. 17.
   Also today, the former Nazi official's son, Wolf-Ruediger Hess,
visited the grave along with his wife, Andrea.
   Wunsiedel police spokesman Roland Weber did not say whether the
Italian demonstrators were able to get close to the cemetery.
   ``There were 15 Italians in all, carrying two banners with
swastika-like emblems,'' Weber told The Associated Press. ``They
are considered to be right-wing extremists.''
   Demonstrators had given notice of their plans, said Christoph
Schiller, district government chairman in Wunsiedel in far
northeastern Bavaria 11 miles from the Czechoslovakian border.
Schiller said protests are banned from midnight Tuesday until
midnight Sunday.
   ``We'd been told to expect between 500 to 1,000 right-wing
extremists,'' Schiller said Tuesday.
   Within days of Hess' death last year, police in Wunsiedel
arrested more than 100 right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis who
converged on the town. Many were wearing neo-Nazi emblems and
shouting neo-Nazi slogans.
   Hess, who was deputy to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, was the sole
prisoner in Spandau, which was administered by France, Britain, the
United States and the Soviet Union, the Allies of World War II.

   Student leaders made anti-government
speeches before up to 5,000 people in Burma's capital today,
diplomats said, in the largest protest in Rangoon since bloody
riots forced the president to resign.
   Diplomats in Rangoon said protesters rallied in front of Rangoon
General Hospital, a gathering spot for demonstrators after security
forces allegedly shot doctors and nurses there during last week's
rioting.
   Japan's Kyodo news service, reporting from Rangoon, cited
reports of an orderly demonstration of nearly 10,000 people in
Mandalay, the country's second-largest city. The report, which
could not be independently confirmed, said protesters included
uniformed doctors and nurses.
   Diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity said security
forces made no effort to interfere with the rally in Rangoon.
During last week's disturbances, security forces repeatedly fired
on protesters who refused to disperse and many people were killed.
   State-run Radio Rangoon says at least 95 people were killed and
240 wounded last week in the largest demonstrations since Burma
became independent from Britain in 1948. Western diplomats say they
believe hundreds were killed but say they have no evidence.
   Diplomats said 3,000 to 5,000 protesters today held up placards
and listened to speeches by students leading a campaign to end
authoritarian rule after the resignation Friday of hard-line
President Sein Lwin. In recent days students have distributed
leaflets and pasted posters throughout the city calling for more
demonstrations.
   A Western diplomat said protesters and monks also held a
Buddhist memorial service in front of the hospital for those who
died last week.
   ``It seems to be a kind of stationary rally, with no marching,''
he said. He said it began in the late morning and continued into
the late afternoon.
   A Western diplomat said about 1,000 people held a similar rally
in front of the hospital on Tuesday and passed out leaflets
demanding the dismantling of the Burma Socialist Program Party.
   Sein Lwin resigned as state president and party chairman after
only 17 days in power. He had replaced Ne Win, whose 1962 military
coup ended democracy in Burma and instituted one-party rule.
   The party and the legislature scheduled emergency sessions for
Friday, presumably to choose a new leadership.
   One senior Western diplomat today reported rumors of dissension
within the military and said a coup was possible if army commanders
feel the leadership changes do not meet popular calls for reform.
   During last week's rioting, security forces in at least two
towns reportedly sided with demonstrators.
   The brutal handling of the riots put the government under
mounting pressure for radical change. Kyodo said a group of former
politicians including former Prime Minister Nu issued a statement
today calling for creation of a people's ``national interim
committee'' to serve as caretaker government and end the crisis.
   The statement said security forces killed many innocent people.
It said the government has lost control and warned of more
bloodshed if the government continues its present policies.
   A Western diplomat said the daughter of late Burmese
independence leader Aung San issued a statement in Rangoon today
calling for multi-party rule. The statement was addressed to Kyaw
Htin, the No. 3 government official as secretary of the State
Council.
   The statement called for creation of a ``people's consultative
committee'' to form a caretaker government that would oversee a
transition to multi-party rule.
   The daughter, Aung San Suu Kyi, is visiting her mother in
Rangoon, the diplomat said. He said she lives in Cambridge,
England, with her British husband, a university professor.
   In an extraordinary rebuke, the Rangoon Lawyers' Council on
Tuesday lodged an unprecedented formal protest with the government
over security forces' firing on peaceful protesters.
   The council is under the government's Council of People's
Attorneys.
   ``Some people were shot in a hospital, inside their houses, and
at a tea shop. It was ... a violation of human rights,'' said the
letter, signed by 177 lawyers.
   ``Shooting at demonstrators from behind in some areas was a
sheer violation of the U.N. declaration of human rights,'' it said.
   It said the dead were buried without their families being
notified and that thousands of people were arrested.
   The letter demanded multiparty rule, lifting of the state of
emergency in Rangoon and other cities, release of those detained,
immediate halt to use of force by security personnel, an
independent investigation into the shootings, and disclosure of
information on casualties.
   A text was obtained from one of the foreign embassies that
received copies of the letter.
   ``It's considered significant in that many prominent people have
signed it,'' a Western diplomat in Rangoon said today.

   An aircraft carrying President

Wednesday after taking off from an airport in Lahore, U.S.
diplomatis said.
   The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they

southeast of Islamabad.
   In Washington, congressional and Reagan administration sources
confirmed that Raphel was on board the aircraft. The sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, had no further details on the
crash.
   Conflicting unofficial reports said the crash may have involved
a fixed wing aircraft struck by an anti-aircraft missile. There was
also speculation that it may have been a helicopter collision. A
U.S. diplomat in Islamabad said without elaborating that ``the
helicopters sounds right.''

   Raphel, 43 and a antive of Troy, N.Y., was named ambassador to
the Southeast Asian country in January 1987 by President Reagan. It

Roosevelt, died today, his 74th birthday, of cancer at the Vassar
Brothers Hospital.
   Roosevelt, who lived in Millbrook, was admitted to the hospital

   Christopher Roosevelt said his father died of lung cancer. ``It
was a very late diagnosis and very fast moving.''

   A woman arrested for creating a

a sheriff's deputy before she was restrained, police said.
   Kent County Sheriff's Deputy Jack Hertel, 34, was hospitalized
in fair condition today with a wound to the stomach. Grand Rapids
Police Officer Richard Schaafsma was treated and released after a
shot grazed his head.
   The shootings occurred just before midnight Tuesday when the
30-year-old woman, whose name was withheld pending arraignment,
grabbed the gun from Schaafsma's holster while she was being
transported to the Kent County Jail from the jail's garage,
Undersheriff James Dougan said.
   The woman shot Schaafsma once before turning the weapon on
Hertel, an unarmed corrections officer, Undersheriff James Dougan
said. She emptied the .38-caliber gun, firing six times, he said.

   Air-conditioned government buildings were opened for the elderly
in two states, state fair exhibitors packed livestock in ice and
band members sweltered in a scorching stadium as record heat
covered much of the nation.
   Record highs were set Tuesday from the eastern Plains to the
Ohio Valley, and the National Weather Service predicted more heat
and high humidity today across the nation's mid-section, but the
Northeast got a break.
   ``It's great,'' 25-year-old New York City sanitation worker
Frank Nahodyil said while sweeping a street.
   ``We've been sweating like hell the last few weeks. I start at 6
in the morning. I'd be dripping wet by 7 and dying by 10. But now
there's a breeze.''
   The temperature in New York City only reached 86 Tuesday, after
32 days of 90-degree and above temperatures. In Portland, Maine and
Wilkes-Barre, Pa., the overnight temperature dipped below 60.
   The heat continued elsewhere.
   Temperature records for the date were reached in more than a
dozen cities.
   Milwaukee broke a 52-year-old record for the most days of
triple-digit temperatures in a year _ five. The 100-degree reading
Tuesday also broke the high for the date of 98, set in 1937.
   In Chicago, the temperature hit 100, making the 46th day of 90s
or higher this season.
   Things didn't cool down much by early today: it was 86 in both
St. Louis and Minneapolis-St. Paul after midnight.
   High temperatures today were expected to range from the middle
90s to near 105 degrees from the mid-Atlantic states through the
lower Ohio, mid-Mississippi and lower Missouri valleys into the
central Plains.
   In Kansas City, the heat wilted about 10,000 competitors at the
Drum Corps International World Championships. And the artificial
turf at Arrowhead Stadium didn't help, with the temperature an
estimated 130 degrees on the playing field, said Joe Clark, the
stadium's security manager.
   ``As I was walking off the field, sweat was just pouring into my
eyes,'' said Robert Muller, of the Americanos Drum Corps from
Appleton, Wis.
   Four chickens at the Indiana State Fair became heat victims when
the owners left the contest-bound fowl in their cars with the
windows up in the 101-degree heat, said fair spokesman Jeff Fisher.
   Livestock exhibitors were taking extra precautions in the fair
barns.
   ``They're packing some (animals) down with ice. They're putting
ice in front of fans to blow cool air,'' Fisher said.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad authorized the use of some
air-conditioned government buildings for the elderly and others to
escape the heat.
   ``When it's this hot, if elderly people don't have air
conditioning, it's really just too hard on their system,'' said
Betty Grandquist, executive director of the Iowa Department of
Elder Affairs.
   In Wisconsin, Dane County Executive Richard J. Phelps ordered
the County Forum exhibition hall opened to senior citizens and
others.
   Kentucky officials advised those without air conditioning to go
to senior citizens centers or malls.
   At least six Kentucky school systems have delayed classes or
closed schools this summer because of the heat, said Gordon
Nichols, chief spokesman at the state Department of Education.
   Illinois officials also were considering ways to get kids out of
steamy classrooms during the hottest part of the day when school
resumes next week.
   ``If school had started this week, it would have been
intolerable for the students,'' said associate principal Don
Tokarski of Rantoul Township High School. ``If it looks like this
weather will continue, we'll have classes from 7 a.m. until 12:30
p.m.''
   The Pottawattamie County, Iowa, engineer's office set an hour
earlier starting time for its road crews to keep them out of the
heat as much as possible.
   ``And we certainly don't object if someone working in the sun
wants to drop off in the shade for a little bit to cool off,''
County Engineer Jerry Hare said.
   As people turned air conditioners on to cool off, many utilities
reported record electricity consumption.
   The government-owned Tennessee Valley Authority, which serves
six southeastern states, set a summer record for power usage for a
second consecutive day Tuesday as the valley reported an average
high of 97 degrees, officials said.
   Iowa Public Service Co. in Sioux City broke the record for peak
usage that was set on Monday. Wisconsin Power & Light Co. also
reported a record load.
   Town council members in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., tired of hearing how
hot it's been this summer, passed a resolution Monday night making
it illegal to report a temperature over 90 degrees within city
limits.
   Anyone caught violating the law will be banished to the top of
the local civic center's marquee where they will be sentenced to
make ice sculptures until they no longer melt.

   More than 100 Palestinians were treated for
beating injuries today in the Gaza Strip, hospital officials said,
during a Palestinian general strike to protest Israeli rule of the
occupied lands.
   The army said it could not immediately confirm any injury
reports.
   Israel deported four Palestinians from the occupied Gaza Strip
to Lebanon today, said police in Rachaiya, Lebanon. The move
brought to 33 the number of deportees since an Arab uprising
against Israeli rule began eight months ago.
   Also today, the army opened an inquiry into the causes of
Tuesday's prison riot in which two Arabs were killed. A letter by
inmates at the tent prison of Kedziot said they were on a hunger
strike to press for the prison's closing.
   Soldiers sealed off Gaza for a third straight day today,
confining 650,000 Palestinians to their homes and barring reporters
from the occupied territory.
   Officials at Shifa Hospital in Gaza said 105 Palestinians were
treated today for beating injuries. ``Most of the injuries were
bruises and contusions,'' Dr. Ahmed Yazeji, chief surgeon at Shifa,
said in an interview.
   Yazeji said the bruises appeared to be caused by beatings with
``clubs and rifle butts and kicking with heavy military boots.''
   He said 90 percent of the victims said they were beaten in their
homes by troops looking for suspected stone-throwers after a surge
of violence in Gaza.
   Troops shot and wounded two Palestinians in Gaza today, and they
were treated at the nearby Ahli Arab Hospital, officials at the
hospital said.
   In refugee Camp No. 1 near the occupied West Bank city of
Nablus, soldiers opened fire on Arab stone-throwers today, wounding
a 17-year-old in the right thigh, said officials at Al Ittihad
Hospital.
   Under the general strike call, many of the 110,000 Palestinians
who work in Israel boycotted their jobs. Arab-owned shops and
businesses were closed in at least a dozen towns and cities in the
occupied lands.
   The strike came in response to a leaflet issued by underground
leaders of the uprising. It said the strike was ``in honor of
Jerusalem, the capital of our Palestinian state and to protest
oppressive measures and arrests.''
   Israel says about 5,000 Palestinians have been jailed since the
revolt began, about half without trial.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization says it plans to declare a
Palestinian state or set up a government-in-exile for the occupied
lands in response to Jordan's decision to sever administrative ties
with the territories. Israel opposes a Palestinian state.
   Police in Rachaiya, Lebanon, said Mohammed Gharableh, Ahmed abu
Muailek, Yusri Darwish al Hums and Fathi Ibrihim Shakaki, all from
the Gaza Strip, were deported today. All four dropped their appeals
with the Israeli Supreme Court this month.
   Police said the four were flown to Israel's self-declared
security zone in south Lebanon. Informed sources said they were
given $50 each.
   The United States has protested Israel's policy of deportations
but Israel defends the measure as the most effective means of
deterring violence.
   Tensions were high after the Tuesday riot in Ketziot, 20 miles
south of the Gaza Strip, by hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The
army said two Palestinians were shot to death in the riot and a
third was wounded, but it refused to elaborate, saying the riot was
under investigation.
   Inmates in the 2,500-prisoner camp have complained about poor
conditions, including overcrowding, substandard food and
insufficient water for bathing.
   The AP obtained a copy of a letter smuggled out of the prison
and written by inmates which called for closing Ketziot. The letter
said the inmates were staging a hunger strike to press their
demands.
   ``Yes to the pangs of hunger, no to surrender,'' the letter said.
   The deaths brought to 247 the number of Palestinians killed
since the uprising began Dec. 8. Four Israelis have died.
   Arab news reports said the victims were Assad Jabra el Shawwa,
25 of Gaza City and Bassam Ibrahim al Samoudi, 27, of Yamoun
village in the West Bank. Both were serving six-month terms without
trial under administrative detention.
   The Yediot Ahronot daily said the riot began during a visit by
representatives of the International Red Cross. The organization
could not immediately be reached for comment.
   Other reports said it began after news of violence and of the
curfew in Gaza, where many inmates live.
   About 1,000 prisoners in one section of the prison shouted
Palestinian nationalist slogans, cursed and hurled rocks at
soldiers and tried to scale a barbed-wire fence, the Haaretz
newspaper said.
   Soldiers reportedly responded by firing tear gas, rubber bullets
and then live ammunition at the rioters.

   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on honorariums for members of Congress:
   Too many of our representatives in Washington have been
accepting honorariums from special interests. Taxpayers can only
hope they've done nothing to deserve the gifts they accept.
   Let us assume this congressional tradition is as innocent as
congressional honorarium-takers claim.
   There is still an appearance of influence-peddling. There is an
impression Congress, or at least some of its members, can be
bought. ...
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, whose ethics have been
scrutinized recently because he accepted a highly questionable fee
from a book publisher, has joined (Rep. Dan) Rostenkowski in
proposing an outright prohibition on honorariums. ...
   Congress has seen fit to prohibit members of the executive
branch from accepting speaking fees and other honorariums. It
should set the same high standard for itself.

   The Olympian, Olympia, Wash., on the Iran-Iraq cease-fire:
   On Aug. 20, a cease-fire monitored by U.N. observers is to take
effect in the Persian Gulf, ending one of the most brutal wars of
modern times.
   Both Iran and Iraq claim victory, but both are losers. ...
   The bloody war was fought largely without any foreign observers,
but it is believed 1 million soldiers were killed and perhaps twice
that number wounded. Rocket attacks on cities claimed thousands of
civilian lives. ...
   The cost in dollars is nearly as staggering _ at least $200
billion in economic loss.
   All for what purpose? None that we know of.
   The leaders of Iran and Iraq are guilty of attempted genocide
that took terrible tolls, but they never will be brought to trial.
   Since Iran and Iraq continue to proclaim victory in ignorance,
the world can only hope that others will learn from this horrible
example of the futility of war.

   Sunday Sun-Journal, Lewiston, Maine, on the presidential race:
   From the time it became clear that George Bush and Michael
Dukakis would be the 1988 presidential contenders, nobody expected
high drama, inspired philosophizing or passionate rhetoric on the
campaign trail. After all, neither man is exactly overloaded with
charisma.
   But what the American public has had to endure so far is enough
to make voters devoutly wish that someone will mount a credible
nationwide write-in campaign for president.
   Both candidates are preoccupied with trading barbs; neither
seems able to dispense with sniping and deal with substantive
issues.
   If last week's exchanges were any indication of the way the rest
of the campaign will be conducted, November can't come too soon.
The voters' patience will be totally exhausted by Election Day.

   The News and Courier, Charleston, (S.C., on job satisfaction:
   This will come as a surprise for Yuppies, whose mating ritual
revolves around the term, ``What do you do?'', but most Americans
don't care much for their jobs.
   Matter of fact, compared to Europeans and Japanese, they care
very little.
   A poll conducted by International Research Associates and the
Roper Organization disclosed that Americans ranked their job eighth
in importance on a list of 10 significant aspects of their lives.
   Europeans put jobs fourth and Japanese listed them second.
Americans and Europeans ranked their children's educations first;
Japanese gave top billing to health. ...
   On that same list, Americans ranked their family lives as most
satisfying; ditto the Japanese and Europeans.

   The Advocate, Stamford, Conn., on polluting our planet:
   We in our own generation are becoming afraid of the sun and air.
These givers of life that sustain and nourish us have been turned
by years of humanity's greed, ignorance and indifference into alien
elements.
   Suddenly, we are more aware than ever of living in a damaged
cocoon. ...
   Daily reports on the greenhouse effect and the ozone drive us
from our natural environment in search of artificial shelter.
   The daily weather report jars us as we check the air quality and
pollution standard index. We read and find what new horror from
drought and heat awaits this delicate sphere and its inhabitants.
...
   Pollutants from rivers, cleaners and pesticides are taking a
destructive toll on the fragile body of water that hugs our shores.
The fish don't have oxygen. Careless dumping is poisoning the
waterfront.
   We are killing the water, the very place where life on the
planet began. ...
   Time is running out. We must arise, awaken and save our Earth

   North Jersey Herald and News, Passaic, N.J., on ``The Last
Temptation of Christ'':
   ``The Last Temptation (Of Christ)'' ... questions the divine
nature of Christ ... to portray what its creators say is the human
Christ: a man prone to self-doubt, sexual urges, temptation and
even error.
   Religious groups denounce ``The Last Temptation'' as
``blasphemous'' and ``repugnant,'' and call upon the faithful to
help keep this film far from neighborhood theaters.
   The opposition's outcry only hands Universal Pictures a golden
platter full of publicity.
   Equally troubling, the calls for boycott and bans before the
film's release touch the raw nerve of censorship.
   Prior censorship violates the First Amendment-protected right of
free speech, an amendment all churches have an abiding interest in
upholding. The First Amendment also provides for religious freedom.
   The faithful would do well to remember: Hollywood is no
theological seminary. Don't give the film credit, where credit
isn't due.

   The Brainerd (Minn.) Daily Dispatch on ``The Last Temptation of
Christ'':
   Seldom has a movie received harsher criticism prior to its
release than ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' directed by Martin
Scorsese.
   The film has been labeled blasphemous by a number of religious
groups, most conspicuously fundamentalists, for its portrayal of
Jesus.
   In the most controversial scene, Jesus, suffering agony on the
cross, imagines what life would have been like had he lived as a
normal man. In this delirium, he is shown engaging in sex.
   No doubt, behind the public breast-beating of most religious
critics lies sincere moral outrage.
   These people's opinions should be acknowledged and respected.
However, they must be reminded that the same Constitution that
guarantees them freedom of religion also provides freedom of
expression. ...
   Those who wish to experience the picture's message should be
allowed to do so in peace. Those who don't should stay home and
read the Bible, which is how Christ's message was meant to be
conveyed in the first place.

conversation for many of America's business people.
   This talk is becoming more than words as businesses are taking
an active role in the education of America's schoolchildren.
   The number of school volunteers is growing in the United States

They are giving their financial support as well as sharing some
innovative ideas.

   The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson, Ariz., on Edwin Meese:
   The new U.S. attorney general is less than enthusiastic about
his predecessor's dramatic parting shot, and with good reason.
   There was no need for Edwin Meese's final act in office, an
order requiring that independent prosecutors be appointed to
investigate criminal allegations against members of Congress.
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh is the man who, during the
Ford administration, headed the criminal division of the Justice
Department. ...
   Independent prosecutors are meant to step in when a conflict of
interest might otherwise result in the course of an investigation.
   But Edwin Meese, himself dogged by two independent prosecutors,
ordered a broader use.
   On ... his last day in office, he signed an order requiring the
appointment of a special prosecutor whenever serious allegations of
wrongdoing are made against members of Congress.
   Given no need for such a change, it appears that congressional
skeptics are right in suspecting vindictiveness.

   The Journal-Bulletin, Providence, R.I., on the cost of U.N.
peacekeeping:
   Peace does not come cheaply.
   The cost of arranging the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and
the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war will leave the United Nations
financially strapped.
   The tab for peacekeeping missions will increase from roughly 25
percent of the U.N. budget to more than twice the entire budget. In
fact, the U.N. could run out of funds by November.
   Peace may be breaking out all over, but no one is breaking out
his wallet.
   One particularly important holdout is the United States, which
has been withholding its dues since 1985, charging that the
organization was anti-American.
   Now the United States is $467 million in arrears, including this
year's assessment of $44 million.

   The Miami Herald on Oscar Arias and peace in Central America:
   (Costa Rican President) Oscar Arias continues to try to earn his
1987 Nobel Peace Prize, but he gets precious little help from
either side of the ideological wars of Central America.
   His latest contribution is an open acknowledgement that Cuba's
role in the peace process must be commensurate with its role in the
war.
   President Arias has used the occasion of Ecuador's presidential
inauguration to discuss the subject with Fidel Castro. He reports
that the Cuban leader's response was moderate and constructive.
   That's important, because the Costa Rican president holds Cuba's
client, the Nicaraguan government, responsible for the breakdown of
peace negotiations this summer. ...
   For now, Oscar Arias is the only major player who focuses on the
fact that young boys are dying on both sides of Nicaragua's
fratricidal war and El Salvador's as well.
   He hopes to stop the killing, and he is willing to talk with
anyone from Ronald Reagan to Fidel Castro in pursuit of a peace
that freedom-loving Central Americans can accept.

   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal on naming Lauro Cavazos as education
secretary:
   Democrats got to have their cake and bash it too last week as
President Reagan nominated Lauro F. Cavazos, the 61-year-old
president of Texas Tech University and Health Science Center in
Lubbock, to replace Secretary of Education William Bennett.
   Democrats got a nominee they can be happy with, but they also
got a selection they can bash as a cynical attempt to improve
George Bush's election hopes by naming a Hispanic to a cabinet
level position for the first time.
   Of course, there's no advantage to a cynical move exposed as
such. That allows people across the political spectrum who are
vitally concerned with education to focus on Cavazos, not the
circumstances surrounding his nomination.
   There are many who could run the Department of Education as
competently, but perhaps none so suited to tackle a critical
dilemma of the U.S. system, its failure to engage, hold and uplift
the educational norm of minorities.

   Packwood introduced his bill ... asking for a reasoned,
practical, free-enterprise way in which the federal tax law can
make life a little easier for American families with small children
who need day care while the parents work. ...
   If a child-care bill has to be enacted, it should be one modeled

   Uniontown (Pa.) Herald-Standard on lead in drinking water:
   The Environmental Protection Agency ... proposed rules governing
the amount of lead in drinking water for Americans.
   Costs to consumers could run extremely high. Those getting water
from smaller systems could see water bill increases of $367 per
year.
   EPA's action helps many to avoid the health hazards associated
with lead in their water. Most families will be pleased by this.
   But ... for many families, especially those on lower or fixed
incomes, we must ask how these families are to pay water bills
hundreds of dollars more each year when many can't afford to
properly feed their young.
   Environmentalists are right in seeking lead reduction in water
at the tap, but to force families to replace plumbing systems would
be a tremendous burden to many.
   EPA took some good first steps. Evaluating them within a
reasonable time will help determine if additional lead restrictions
are needed.

   Daily News, Los Angeles, on the U.S.-Contra policy:
   The Senate's Democrats have just managed to wriggle out of a
vote on military aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, thereby sparing
themselves the unpleasantness of having to take a clear and
meaningful stand.
   The Senate narrowly decided Wednesday (Aug. 10) to continue U.S.
policy of sending near-worthless care packages _ food, medicine and
the like _ to those foes of the Sandinista government.
   While the Contras technically get another crack at military
supplies next month, there is scant hope that Congress will approve
Contra arms funding during the remaining five months of the Reagan
presidency.
   Thus, the civil war between the Contras and the Marxist
Sandinistas may indeed be over, depending on who wins the
presidential election. But even under a presumably pro-Contra Bush
administration, it might already be too late.

   The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times on the Iran-Iraq cease-fire:
   The Iran-Iraq cease-fire, to begin on Aug. 20, is the essential
first step down what can be expected to be a difficult road to
peace in the Persian Gulf.
   It also comes as additional, and welcome, evidence that the
United Nations can play an effective peacemaking role in the world.
   The United Nations could do little to forge solutions to
regional conflicts when it was paralyzed by constant disputes
between the United States and the Soviet Union.
   But where there has been mutual superpower willingness to
support U.N. efforts, the organization has proved its value.
   Even as the U.N. enlarges its peacemaking role, however, it
faces crippling fiscal constraints.
   They are caused primarily by the refusal of the United States to
pay its dues and its share of the cost of U.N. peacekeeping
operations. ...
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., who sponsored legislation
witholding full payment of U.N. dues, believes the time has now
come for the United States ``to shoulder our responsibility'' for
U.N. funding.
   We fully agree.

   Police arrested 78 anti-abortion protesters at
two clinics today as activists continued a four-week-old series of
demonstrations.
   Police spokesman Cal Jackson said 32 protesters were arrested at
Midtown Hospital and 46 were arrested at the Feminist Women's
Health Center, both scenes of earlier demonstrations.
   On Tuesday, protesters briefly breached police lines near an
abortion clinic before 157 demonstrators were sent to jail in the
largest mass arrest since the protests began.
   There was some shoving Tuesday between protesters and police as
the officers realigned themselves between the clinic and protesters
who had gotten through their lines.
   Officials on each side accused the other of escalating the
confrontation.
   ``They are being jerks. The police are trying to make the
situation more tense than it needs to be,'' said Michael McMonagle,
deputy director of Operation Rescue, the New York-based
organization coordinating the protests.
   Atlanta police Sgt. Melvin Denson said he heard some protest
leaders ``telling their people to head straight for my men.''
   Today's arrests raised to 671 the total arrested in the
protests, which began during the Democratic National Convention
last month. Officials said 244 of the protesters remained in the
Atlanta and Fulton County jails Tuesday night.

<HEAD>Port Workers, Coal Miners Join Strike To Legalize Solidarity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Port workers in Szczecin and
southwestern coal miners today declared sympathy strikes with
miners demanding the legalization of Solidarity, opposition
activists said.
   In support of an estimated 3,000 colleagues striking for a
second day at the July Manifesto mine in Jastrzebie, workers at the
nearby Morcinek mine refused today to take up their tools and
launched their own occupation strike.
   Port workers occupied the docks in Szezecin, about 250 miles
northwest of Warsaw, and set up a 15-member strike committee, said
Jan Kostecki, a leader of the independent union federation.
   A local prosecutor immediately declared the strike illegal,
Solidarity officials said.
   Andrzej Andrzejczak, head of the Morcinek mine strike committee,
said: ``We support all of the demands of the July Manifesto mine
workers.''
   The mine is about 12 miles south of July Manifesto, where
strikers were demanding legalization of the outlawed independent
labor federation, pay raises and reinstatement of workers fired for
trade union activites.
   Police ringing July Manifesto, one of Poland's largest coal
mines, today turned away area residents who tried to bring food to
the strikers.
   Andrzejczak said the Morcinek miners broke off talks with
management when they were refused access to loudspeakers and
contact with the strikers at July Manifesto. He said miners erected
a large Polish flag atop the administration building and were
blocking the complex's main entrance.
   It was not immediately known how many workers were involved.
   The second strike came as Solidarity strike committee members
met with management and representatives of the Industry Ministry at
the July Manifesto colliery.
   Adam Kowalczyk, a regional Solidarity leader, said more workers
were joining colleagues inside by leaping over police barricades.
   The strike committee issued a communique today saying the
workers would not end their stoppage until their demands are met
and charged: ``The mine management is trying to end the strike by
hunger.''
   Police surrounded the mine after workers put down their tools on
Tuesday. Witnesses said about 600 officers were outside and about
3,000 strikers inside.
   The strikes mark the eighth anniversary of the birth of the
Solidarity, which Communist authorities crushed in a 1981 military
crackdown.
   Miners leaving July Manifesto this morning said wage demands
were based on hardships caused by Poland's worsening economy,
including 60 percent inflation.
   ``The economy is in ruins,'' one told The Associated Press.
``Miners cannot live on their salaries because of recent price
hikes.''
   Miners earn nearly twice the average national salary and receive
extra benefits because of the vital role they play in the economy.
Poland is the world's fourth largest exporter of coal, and coal is
the nation's leading export.
   July Manifesto, a hotbed of labor activism during the strike
wave that spawned Solidarity, is one of five coal mines in the
region.
   Solidarity adviser Jacek Kuron said there were no reports of
violence and police made no attempt to move into the mine, which is
280 miles southwest of Warsaw and employs about 9,000 workers.
   The state-run PAP news agency, in a dispatch late Tuesday, said
the strike was illegal. PAP said the miners were warned that ``they
may be held responsible for their illegal actions.''
   The July Manifesto mine is in Silesia, Poland's industrial
heartland.
   Eight years ago, a wave of mine strikes in Silesia ended with
the signing at July Manifesto of the last of three agreements that
established Solidarity across the nation. The pact also won
work-free weekends.
   Solidarity leaders said the strike began Tuesday when overnight
shift workers refused to take up their tools. They were joined by
workers arriving for the morning shift, Kuron said.
   Kuron said mine management then locked out members of the
afternoon shift to prevent them from joining the strike.
   Solidarity spokesmen said workers at the nearby Borynia mine
staged a brief sympathy rally but went back to work Tuesday
afternoon.
   Also Tuesday, security officials briefly detained 10 Solidarity
activists at the Rudna copper mine near the city of Wroclaw in
lower Silesia.
   That mine has also been the scene of unrest in recent months,
where workers have demanded improved safety conditions.
   Five strikes in Poland from April 25 to May 10, and brief
stoppages or strike threats in 25 more work places, constituted the
worst labor unrest in the country since the 1981 martial-law
crackdown. One of the stoppages, at a steel mill near Krakow, was
broken up by security forces.
   The workers in those strikes also demanded the legalization of
Solidarity, along with wage increases.

<HEAD>Authorities Recommend That Village Libraries Remove Pre-Gorbachev
Books</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with official saying act was
recommendation sted order, saying woman doesn't work for Crimean
library, details. No pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have recommended that village public
libraries remove from their shelves political and economic
literature published before Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev took
power, an official said today.
   The government newspaper Izvestia, in a letter attributed to a
librarian, referred to the move as an order.
   But Leonid Bely, director of the state culture agency in the
Crimea, said today that the directive from the central Ministry of
Culture in Moscow was only a recommendation and was not politically
motivated.
   ``It's for the cleaning out of the book fund,'' Bely said in a
telephone interview from Simferopol, the Crimean administrative
center.
   Izvestia published the letter Tuesday attributed to a librarian
in the Crimea, a region of the Ukraine, saying libraries were
ordered to remove works by former Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev
and other top officials now in disgrace.
   The author complained that the order would create new ``blank
spots,'' or gaps, in the Soviet historical record.
   But Bely said no woman by the name given as the author in
Izvestia, I. Zavgordnyaya, worked in the Crimea's libraries.
   He said library workers were called to a meeting in May at which
cultural officials recommended outdated political and economic
literature be transferred from village to city and regional
libraries. The village libraries are becoming overstocked and do
not have room for outdated materials and new works with little
demand, Bely said.
   He said the suggestion applied to village libraries throughout
the Soviet Union.
   The letter in Izvestia said the directive suggested that library
workers they tell people asking for the removed materials that they
are all on loan. The letter said it included works by former Soviet
leaders Brezhnev and Konstantin U. Chernenko ``and a series of
other authors.''
   The letter did not say who issued the order and did not say
whether it applied to public libraries throughout the Soviet Union.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said he was
surprised by the letter and had heard of no order like the one
mentioned.
   But he said the action sounded like a ``local initiative'' by
officials who were ``doing more than necessary'' to set the country
on the right course.
   He cited a Russian proverb to say that some local officials were
incompetent: ``Make a fool bow and he will be sure to knock his
head.''
   Brezhnev's rule from 1964 to his death in 1982 has been
criticized as plagued by corruption, cronyism and nepotism. He and
his aides have also been blamed for covering up the country's
problems and repressing independent political and cultural thinkers.
   Chernenko ruled from February 1984 until his death in March 1985.
   According to the Izvestia letter, the order covered ``outdated''
material from 1961 until the March 1985 session at which Gorbachev
was named party general secretary.
   The order seems to go against the new trend of taking the wraps
off materials that were closed to the public for many years, the
letter said.
   ``Wouldn't this mean that, while opening access to archival
materials of a half-century ago, we are creating new blank spots in
our most recent history?'' said the letter.
   Gorbachev, under his policy of glasnost, or openness, has
encouraged a more accurate and honest examination of Soviet
history. He has called for elimination of ``blank spots,'' taboo
subjects such as the repressions of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
   As a result of the review, Stalin has been criticized for
creating a ``cult of personality,'' and Brezhnev's tenure has been
branded a ``period of stagnation.''
   Before Gorbachev, almost every other Soviet leader has
encouraged the suppression of books and other works that deal with
policies, people or events that have fallen out of favor.

<HEAD>Egypt and PLO Agree on Provisional Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak agreed that the PLO
should establish a provisional Palestinian government in the
Israeli-occupied territories, a senior PLO official said.
   Mahmoud Abbas, a member of the PLO Executive Committee, spoke on
Egypt Television Tuesday night after meeting Mubarak in Alexandria.
He led a high-ranking Palestine Liberation Organization delegation
that arrived in Cairo on Monday.
   ``We and President Mubarak reached the conclusion that the PLO
should offer through a provisional government a political program
that would be internationally acceptable,'' said Abbas, also known
as Abu-Mazen.
   He said the political program would ``explain to the world the
rational and logical PLO objectives so as to corner the enemies of
our people's independence and self-determination.''
   He apparently referred to Israel, whose Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir opposes Palestinian self-determination that might lead to
the creation of an independent Palestinian state.
   PLO officials have said a provisonal government would be ready
to recognize Israel in exchange for Israel's recognition of a
Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The PLO reportedly is debating whether to declare a state in the
occupied lands, home to about 1.5 million Palestinians. It is also
considering whether to establish a provisional government or a
government-in-exile.
   These options were brought up after Jordan's decision this month
to hand to the PLO full responsibility for the West Bank and Gaza.
   Asked when an announcement of a Palestinian government could be
made, Abbas said, ``This is premature because we cannot announce a
governemnt before we have shaped its program and presented it to
the Palestine National Council.''
   The council, combining representatives from all PLO factions, is
the legislative arm that makes all major policy decisions. It is
expected to meet in Algeria next month.

<HEAD>Police: For 10 Days, Youths Hid Friend's Body After Shotgun
Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three brothers playing with a
shotgun panicked after it accidentally discharged, killing a fourth
boy, and dragged their friend's body to a vacant home where it
remained for 10 days, police said.
   ``The kids got panicky. They thought he was dead and they took
him over to the apartment next door,'' said police Detective Ralph
Pflieger.
   An autopsy was scheduled for today to determine whether the
14-year-old died instantly, Pflieger said. The youth's name was
withheld pending positive identification through dental records.
   The teen-ager's mother reported him missing Aug. 8, and police
found the decomposed body in a vacant house on Tuesday.
   The names of the three brothers, ages 12, 14 and 15, were not
released because they are juveniles. No charges have been filed, a
police spokeswoman said.
   A 14-year-old brother who came forward told authorities they
were playing 10 days earlier at an apartment occupied by a cousin
of the brothers, Pflieger said. The cousin wasn't home when the the
foursome found a shotgun and began fooling around with it, police
said. The weapon discharged and struck the other 14-year-old, the
youth told police.
   The three brothers dragged their friend's body next door and
left him there, Pflieger said.
   The 14-year-old told an adult about the shooting after he was
taken into custody at Pinellas County Juvenile Detention Center
later on a charge related to an auto theft, officials said.

   Police persuaded two Oklahoma City men to
sing ``Singin' in the Rain'' on stolen railroad radios, then
followed the sound of music to the brothers' apartment.
   Terry C. Gordon, 27, and Warren M. Gordon, 25, were talking and
singing on a radio frequency used by MK&T Railroad Co., said police
Detective Ed Bradway. Police say the Gordons used two hand-held
radios stolen from the company last week.
   Railroad officials claimed the Gordons' makeshift radio show
interrupted railroad procedures. Officials said someone would start
singing and talking on the radio frequency, preventing the engineer
from hearing.
   Police officers used a directional radio detector to track the
men down Friday night. Det. Bill Pierce said he asked the Gordons
to sing something, knowing the detector would pick up the signals.
   It took police about an hour to locate the Gordons when one of
the brothers belted out his rendition of ``Singin' in the Rain,''
Pierce said.
   ``I kind of hoped he would sing `I've Been Working on the
Railroad,''' Pierce said.
   The men were arrested on complaints of receiving and concealing
stolen property.

   Labor leader A. Philip Randolph, baseball
immortal Lou Gehrig, philanthropist Johns Hopkins and conductor
Arturo Toscanini will be among those honored on U.S. postage stamps
next year.
   In addition, the postal service will produce a stamp booklet
featuring historical steamboats, and will jump into the current
children's craze over dinosaurs with a block of four stamps
featuring the ancient reptiles.
   The annual American sports stamp will feature New York Yankee
star Gehrig, the ironman who played a record 2,130 consecutive
games for the Bronx Bombers.
   The performing arts stamp will feature Toscanini, the famed
orchestra leader.
   The annual black heritage series will honor labor organizer and
leader Randolph, while Hopkins will be the 1989 entry in the great
Americans series.
   Dates for all of the stamps have not yet been determined, but
the Postal Service said the dinosaur stamps will be issued sometime
in the fall. The stamps will focus on giant reptiles common to
North America.
   Next spring a booklet of five stamps will feature the steamboats
that helped tie America toghether, plying the nation's lakes and
rivers in the last century.
   In November of 1989 the Universal Postal Union, the
international organization that coordinates mail delivery between
nations, will meet in Washington and several special stamps will be
issued to honor that event.
   World Expo `89, the first stamp exhibition sponsored by the
Postal Service, will be held in conjunction with the UPU meeting.
   In addition to a single stamp honoring the Expo, two sets of
four stamps will be issued in different formats will be issued,
Designs were not announced.
   Also planned for the event were another undisclosed sheet stamp,
several postal cards and an international aerogramme, which will
honor former Montgomery Blair, Abraham Lincoln's postmaster general.
   Next year will also see single stamps to mark the centennials of
North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and Washington state.
   The series of Constitution stamps will continue with stamps
recognizing the bicentennials of North Carolina, the House of
Representatives, the Senate, the inauguration of George Washington
and the drafting of the Bill of Rights.
   Next year is also the bicentennial of the French Revolution, and
that will be marked by a joint stamp issue with France.
   There will be a stamp recognizing the pre-Colombian peoples and
customs of the Americas, and there will be a new ``Love'' stamp as
well as the now traditional pair of Christmas stamps.
   Postal cards planned for next year include ones honoring
Georgetown University's Healy Hall, the Oklahoma land run and new
issues in the America the Beautiful series.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British newspaper, Today, said today its story
about a daredevil pilot making low-level flights over Paris was a
fake.
   ``It was a complete and absolute spoof. ... It was a bit of
summer fun,'' Today's deputy news editor Alastair Martin said of
the story about the mystery pilot, nicknamed le Baron, or Black
Baron.
   ``We weren't fooled but a whole lot of other people obviously
have been,'' Martin said in a telephone interview.
   The 458,000-circulation tabloid daily, owned by publisher Rupert
Murdoch, ran the fake story over an entire inside page, along with
a picture of a man dressed as a pilot standing beside a light
aircraft.
   The story gave no indication it had been made up, and Martin
refused to elaborate on the reasoning behind publication.
   In the story, Today reporter Bill Mouland said the mystery flier
was a French aristocrat, le Comte de Guillaume, 35, who planned to
make similar buzzing flights over London.
   Low-level flights over Paris are illegal, but several times in
recent weeks a plane has been seen over the city late at night.
   French police, who have tightened surveillance to try to
identify the culprit, say they are not certain whether the flights
are by the same pilot each time.

   A federal agency plans to turn over some
of the 1,000 abandoned houses it owns in Minnesota to private
organizations for temporary housing for homeless people, an agency
official said.
   By November, the agency hopes to offer 10 to 15 single-family
houses rent-free to non-profit groups to provide transitional
housing, Patricia Mack of the federal Housing and Urban Development
Department said Tuesday.
   ``We want to see success,'' Mack said. ``If it works, it quite
likely will be increased.''
   Similar programs are under way in Denver and Los Angeles, Mack
said.
   The houses are owned by the government because the owners
defaulted on Federal Housing Administration-backed mortgages.
   HUD is asking local governments to designate non-profit
organizations to manage and maintain the houses, Mack said.
   ``This is a step in the right direction,'' said Charles Viebahn,
president of People United for Economic Justice, an advocacy group
that has occupied abandoned homes in Minneapolis and staged
protests at the HUD office to dramatize the plight of the homeless.

   The magazine said in an editorial in its March edition that the
Feb. 22 parliamentary primary election was ``a mockery of

   It also had alleged that some voters were intimidated by
administration officials into voting for certain candidates. A
controversial new election system called for officials to count
votes while citizens queued publicly behind the candidate of their
choice, or behind the candidate's agent.
   Chief Magistrate Joseph Mango found Mbugua guilty of failing to
submit certain documents on several dates between January 1986 and

   Two gunmen today entered a
grocery store and shot its 44-year-old owner, who later died in a
hospital, police said.
   Frederick Otley was working in a rear storeroom of his store in
a Protestant section of Belfast when the gunmen entered and asked
for the owner. When Otley appeared, they shot him several times and
fled, police said.
   The Irish National Liberation Army, an extreme Marxist offshoot
of the Irish Republican Army, claimed responsibility for the
shooting in a statement to the British Broadcasting Corp. in
Belfast.
   But the Irish News, a Belfast newspaper, said it received a
statement claiming responsibility from the Irish Revolutionary
Brigade, a group previously unheard of in Northern Ireland.
   Both news organizations said the statements they received were
accompanied by authenticating passwords.
   In 1985, Otley was accused by an informer of terrorist crimes on
behalf of the Protestant paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force, and
was charged with a bombing at a social club which was meant to kill
a force member during an inter-organization feud.
   The charges were dropped when the informer retracted his
statement.
   The British domestic agency Press Association reported that the
murder may have been in retaliation for Protestant guerrillas'
killings of two Catholics last week in Belfast.
   Seamus Morris, 18, and Peter Dolan, 25, were gunned down in a
shopping center in broad daylight in the Catholic Ardoyne area of
north Belfast. The Protestant Action Force, reportedly linked with
the Ulster Volunteer Force, claimed responsibility.
   The Irish Republican Army has been fighting to drive the British
from the predominantly Protestant province and unite it with the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic under socialist rule.

<TEXT>
   Dan Quayle, the soon-to-be Republican vice
presidential nominee, refused today to discuss details of the
Florida golfing vacation he and two other congressman had with
Paula Parkinson in January 1980.
   ``That has been covered and there is nothing to it,'' Quayle
told reporters at a joint news conference with George Bush, who
will head the GOP presidential ticket.
   Asked whether he had seen Mrs. Parkinson on any other occasion,
Quayle replied, ``No.''
   Quayle, now the junior senator from Indiana, was one of three
House members who shared a cottage with Mrs. Parkinson, a lobbyist
who had claimed that she had sexual encounters with ``fewer than a
dozen'' Republican House members.
   Quayle has denied that he had an affair with Mrs. Parkinson, and
Bush aides believe that he has been effectively cleared of any
wrongdoing in the Parkinson scandal.
   Bush's new campaign chief, James A. Baker III, said Tuesday,
``That's been looked into, and there's absolutely nothing to it.''
   Charles Black, another Bush adviser, echoed, ``In this case, to
my knowledge, the allegation's already been shot down.''
   The Justice Department conducted in inquiry ayle, selected for the
No. 2 spot on the
Republican presidential ticket, could well be one of the wealthiest
members of Congress. But the Indiana senator lists as his only
substantial asset newspaper stock valued at ``$250,000 and above.''
   If Quayle's stock in the family-controlled Central Newspapers
Inc., headquartered in Indianapolis, were worth $250,000 or so, he
would not be among the estimated one-third of senators who are
millionaires.
   But federal law requires financial disclosure by members of
Congress and other officials of only broad categories. The highest
category for assets is ``$250,000 and above'' _ whether the asset
is worth $250,001 or more than $500 million.
   In addition, the laws do not require that the actual value of an
asset be listed; thus, Quayle's statement uses book value for the
newspaper stock, which probably understates its value dramatically.
   At a news conference Wednesday morning, Quayle was asked about
reports that his net worth totaled $200 million.
   ``That figure is not correct,'' Quayle said, ``and believe me,
you have caused me a lot of problems at home because my wife has
asked me about that.''
   Vice President George Bush, standing at Quayle's side, added to
the kidding. ``Why do you think I chose him?'' he said.
   Quayle said he would make a full financial disclosure ``in a
reasonable period of time.'' Bush, who released 10 years of his tax
records early in the primary campaign, said, ``We will challenge
the Democrats to release 10 years of tax records ... lay it out on
the table.''
   The 41-year-old Quayle is reputed to be in line to inherit
several million dollars' worth of stock in the newspaper group,
whose holdings include the Indianapolis Star and Indianapolis News
in Indiana and the Arizona Republic and Phoenix Gazette in Arizona.
His uncle, Eugene Pulliam, is publisher of the newspapers.
   The senator's financial disclosure statement also lists his wife
as owning a block of Central stock, with a book value of $100,001
to $250,000.
   Except for the stock in Central Newspapers, Quayle's only
holdings last year were two retirement accounts totaling a maximum
of $65,000; a bank account worth up to $15,000, and an account in
the House of Representatives credit union of $1,000 to $5,000.
   Quayle still holds the title of vice president and associate
publisher of his hometown paper, the family-run Huntington (Ind.)
Herald-Press. That paper's owner, Huntington Newspapers Inc., paid
him $2,625 in director's fees last year, he reported.
   He listed three growth-oriented mutual fund accounts in the
names of his children, totaling up to $45,000, and a bank account
in the children's names worth $1,000 to $5,000.
   Like most other members of the Senate, Quayle received thousands
of dollars last year for making speeches to various
special-interest groups. His honoraria, which totaled $49,255, came
from such diverse sources as the Health Industry Manufacturers
Association and the National Stone Association.
   The Indiana senator wrote several articles for pay, including
two for $40 each that he sold to the Indianapolis papers. He wrote
a $1,000 article for the Army & Navy Journal in Washington.
   To meet Senate limitations on income from honoraria, he donated
$14,302 of the earnings to charity.
   Quayle is a member of the Senate's Budget, Armed Services and
Labor and Human Resources committees. Several of his paid speeches
were to groups with a direct interest in the work of those
committees _ a common practice among members of Congress.
   For example, on March 18, 1987, he was paid $2,000 each for
speeches to the National Committee for Quality Health Care, based
in Washington, and Voluntary Hospitals of America Inc., in Irving,
Texas. General Electric Co., a prime defense contractor, paid him
$2,000 for a speech on April 9.
   Quayle, an avid golfer, listed among his income last year a $250
trophy for participating in the Monterey Peninsula golf tournament.
Gifts he received included less than $200 worth of golf apparel for
himself and his wife, Marilyn, for participating in the Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am tournament, and $288 worth of golf
merchandise from the Kemper Open in Potomac, Md.
   The most expensive gift received by Quayle was $825 worth of
golf merchandise from Indiana pro Fuzzy Zoeller.
   Quayle and his wife were reimbursed by AT&T, a sponsor of the
Monterey tournament, for a round-trip flight to the California
tournament. He also listed reimbursements for travel to charity
skiing competitions in Utah and Idaho, and from the U.S. Telephone
Association, Abbott Laboratories, Electronic Industries Association
and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association for trips to
Phoenix; Waukegan, Ill.; Ft. Myers, Fla., and White Sulphur
Springs, W.Va.
   The Quayles' only liability listed on the financial disclosure
form was a 30-year, 5-percent note that Mrs. Quayle signed in 1975
to borrow up to $50,000 from Huntington Newspapers Inc.

   A strike by coal miners demanding the
legalization of the outlawed Solidarity trade union spread
Wednesday, with employees at a second mine and dock workers in
Szczecin joining the labor unrest.
   About 3,000 miners have been holed up in the July Manifesto
complex near Jastrzebie for two days. Early Wednesday, workers at
the Morcinek coal mine near the Czech border put down their tools
to support them.
   Workers at the July Manifesto mine declared an occupation strike
Tuesday and demanded the reinstatement of Solidarity, crushed by
the communist government in 1981. They also want pay raises and the
rehiring of workers fired for independent trade union activities.
   On Wednesday, 600 workers occupied the Szczecin docks after a
failed round of talks with management, and another 400 might join
in, said Jan Kostecki, a Solidarity leader in the port of Szczecin,
about 250 miles northwest of Warsaw.
   A prosecutor immediately declared the strike illegal, Solidarity
officials said, adding that a strike committee was formed.
   Officials at the port in Szczecin, which employs 7,000 people
and is Poland's second-largest after Gdansk, confirmed only that
strike efforts were under way at the port.
   The mines are about 12 miles apart in Silesia, Poland's most
industrialized region, about 280 miles southwest of Warsaw.
   ``We support all of the demands of the July Manifesto mine
workers,'' said Andrzej Andrzejczak, head of Morcinek's strike
committee.
   He said workers raised a large Polish flag atop the main
administration building and that young miners wearing red and white
armbands blocked the entrance to the mine.
   Solidarity strike committee members at July Manifesto said they
would strike until their demands are met.
   Solidarity strike committee members met with mine management and
Industry Ministry representatives at July Manifesto. Adam
Kowalczyk, a regional Solidarity leader, had no details of the
talks, which continued late Wednesday.
   Officials at both mines were unavailable for comment.
   A strike committee communique earlier Wednesday said mine
management refused to allow food into the mine, and the committee
appealed to community residents to bring bread to the front gate.
   People could be seen throwing bread over the walls that surround
the facility. Bread was not delivered to stores in nearby apartment
complexes Wednesday.
   Police closed off access to the mine Tuesday after about 4,000
workers refused to pick up their tools. About 3,000 workers are
still in the yard inside the complex, witnesses said.
   Public transportation remained suspended Wednesday.
   It was not immediately known how many miners were striking at
Morcinek. The mine, built in 1986, employs about 2,300 workers.
   About 9,000 workers are employed at the July Manifesto mine, one
of Poland's largest and a key producer of high-grade export coal.
   Miners leaving the July Manifesto facility early Wednesday said
the wage demands were based on hardships caused by Poland's
worsening economy and its 60 percent inflation.
   ``The economy is in ruins,'' one miner told The Associated
Press. ``Miners cannot live on their salaries because of recent
price hikes.''
   Poland's miners are paid nearly twice the national average and
receive extra benefits because of the vital role they play in the
nation's economy.
   Poland is the world's fourth largest exporter of coal and its
mining operations are also essential to the nation's steel, power
and shipbuilding industries.
   The government has declared the strike illegal. Strikers at July
Manifesto on Tuesday defied an order to end the occupation.
   The state-run news agency PAP, in a dispatch Wednesday, called
the strikes political provocation and said the workers' demands
``are getting more and more radical.''
   July Manifesto was a hotbed of labor activism during a wave of
strikes that spawned Solidarity eight years ago.
   In 1980, the government signed an agreement with miners at the
Manifesto facility recognizing Solidarity after a series of strikes
crippled mining operations in Silesia.
   Poland had five strikes from April 25 to May 10 and brief work
stoppages or strike threats in 25 more workplaces in the worst
labor unrest in the country since the 1981 martial-law crackdown.
   The workers in those strikes also demanded the legalization of
Solidarity and wage increases.

   The State Department reaffirmed strong U.S.

the death today of President Zia ul-Haq.
   ``We are greatly saddened by the tragedy and convey our deepest
condolences to the government and the people of Pakistan,''
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
   The U.S. official also paid tribute to Arnold L. Raphel, the
American ambassador, who died in the crash. ``The United States has
lost one of its best diplomats and grief goes out to his wife and
his family,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   Pakistan has channeled U.S. missiles and other arms to
anti-government rebels in Afghanistan and helped negotiate the
ongoing withdrawal of Soviet troops from the South Asian country.
   ``We have a long history of close and friendly cooperation with
Pakistan,'' Mrs. Oakley said. ``At this moment of extreme trial, I
want to reiterate our commitment to Pakistan and our full support
for the acting president and his government.''

<HEAD>Bush Says He and Quayle Will Campaign Like ``Pit Bulls''</HEAD>

   George Bush vowed today that he and newly
minted running mate Dan Quayle would campaign like ``a couple of
pit bulls'' against the Democrats this fall.
   ``Competence is important but ideology is very important and
we're going to be talking on both,'' Bush said at a crowded news
conference a few hours before the Republican National Convention
met to hand him its presidential nomination. ``We're going to tell
the truth'' about the political opposition, he said.
   Bush said he tapped the 41-year-old Quayle to run with him
because he is ``one of the rising young stars of the Republican
Party.''
   With Quayle standing at his side, Bush said, ``yes he's young''
_ but also qualified to be ``one heartbeat away from the
president.''
   ``I believe he will help our case in every part of the country
because he understands that what's important is not only what we've
accomplished but what we will accomplish,'' Bush said.
   Bush bristled when he was asked about criticism over his
introduction of his three Mexican-American grandchildren on Tuesday
as ``the little brown ones.''
   ``I find it personally offensive and p.s. I don't want to see
these kids hurt,'' he said. His voice rising, Bush added, ``I don't
like it and this is my family and I'm going to protect them. ...
This heart knows nothing but pride and love for those children and
you're going to see them with me every inch of the way.''
   There was a lighter moment as well at the first news conference
by the Republican ticket.
   When Quayle was asked about reports that he was worth a few
hundred million dollars, Bush stepped to the microphone and said,
``Why do you think I picked him?'' Quayle said estimates of his
wealth were vastly exaggerated.
   The vice president opened his news conference with an
announcement that Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq and U.S.
Ambassador Arnold L. Raphel had been killed in an aircraft
explosion in Pakistan.
   ``Pakistan and the U.S. have a very special relationship and the
loss of Gen. Zia is a great tragedy,'' Bush said. He hailed Raphel
as an ``outstanding ambassador.''
   ``I knew him well,'' said Bush, who has sought to make his
experience in foreign policy an important ingredient in his
campaign.
   Bush said he and Quayle would each be campaigning across the
entire country. Aides said they would head for Quayle's home state
of Indiana when they left the Republican convention city on Friday,
and would make a joint campaign swing over the weekend.
   Behind in the polls, Bush said, ``We're going to tell the truth
and it's going to seem like they've engaged a couple of pit bulls.''
   Bush and Quayle met reporters in their nationally televised news
conference after the vice president paid an early morning visit to
the Superdome to check out the hall where he will deliver his
acceptance speech on Thursday night.
   Bush joked from the podium, banging the gavel and listening to
the echoes as he repeatedly called the mostly empty convention hall
to order.
   Earlier, he had said the goal of his convention speech would be
``to show ... how I want to lead this country, what my
qualifications for leading the country are.'' He said the speech
would include ```some specifics, some competence matters, but I
also think ideology counts.''
   ``I feel comfortable with what we've got now,'' he said of the
speech he has prepared, and added that his wife, Barbara, did not
fall asleep when he tried it out on her.
   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis had confessed that his wife,
Kitty, dozed off while reading an advance copy of his acceptance
speech in Atlanta last month.
   Bush's morning visit to the Superdome was to familiarize himself
with the podium and TelePrompTer system. He told reporters he
believes he can deliver a speech better with a prompting device
than without one.
   Meanwhile, the convention was buzzing about the selection of
Quayle. Many called it a surprising choice, because Quayle lacks
the congressional track record and high profile of some of the more
prominent people Bush had considered.
   But Bush's new campaign chairman, James Baker, said Tuesday that
the selection of the 41-year-old Quayle ``represents a bold stroke
across generations.''
   ``He's the first baby-boomer on a national ticket,'' Baker said.
   ``This man is a man of the future. He is a leader for the
future. He is an excellent campaigner,'' Baker told a news
conference.
   Bush said he decided on Quayle on Tuesday morning before coming
to New Orleans. He announced the selection at a welcoming rally on
the banks of the Mississippi River after a flashy arrival aboard a
sternwheel riverboat.
   The vice president had flown from Washington aboard Air Force
Two to a naval base on the other side of the river.
   The boyish-looking, light-haired Quayle then bounded to the
stage to join Bush and proclaim, ``Let's go get 'em.''
   Bush made the news public after telephoning the other potential
nominees he had considered and sought personal and financial data
from, aides said. The word leaked as Bush was steaming across the
river.
   Before crossing the river, Bush had a brief encounter with
President Reagan at the Belle Chasse Naval Air Station as the
president left New Orleans and Bush arrived.
   When the two were about to go their separate ways, Bush
whispered into the president's ear. Aides later said he was
confiding that the choice was Quayle, and that Reagan was the first
person the vice president told. The second person he told was Mrs.
Bush, said campaign press secretary Sheila Tate.

   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd
Bentsen's gross income averaged $772,181 over the past five years
and he paid an average of $264,453 in federal taxes during the same
period, according to financial records released today by the Texas
senator.
   Bentsen, 67, also made public a blind trust and released a
report from his doctor saying he was ``in excellent health.''
   Bentsen's income tax returns for the years 1983 through 1987
show he earned a high of $1,020,607 in 1983 and a low of $597,906
in 1984. He paid his highest taxes during the period of $403,932 in
1983 and a low of $155,329 the following year.
   The three-term senator also distributed an average of $21,381 in
charitable contributions during those five years.
   In a letter to Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., chairman of the
Senate ethics committee, Bentsen said he was opening the blind
trust because the Office of Government Ethics must review it to see
whether the trust arrangement complies with federal law now that he
is a candidate for vice president.
   ``I have decided to open my trust so that not only the office
but anyone who cares to may learn of my holdings. I enclose a
public report of the list of assets to be distributed, together
with the category value of each asset,'' Bentsen said.
   The blind trust includes common stock in more than a dozen
well-known corporations such as Caterpiller Inc., Chevron,
Colgate-Palmolive Co., Exxon Corp., Johnson & Johnson, mineral
deeds in South Texas and interest in a Houston dairy products
company.
   Bentsen did not provide figures of his exact net worth, but a
source close to Bentsen speaking only on condition of anonymity
said the senator would not argue with other estimates that his net
worth exceeds $10 million.
   After being a congressman from 1949 to 1956, Bentsen returned to
Houston and founded an insurance company that later became a
financial holding company.
   Bentsen's records show gross earnings of $604,587 and taxes of
$253,098 in 1985, earnings of $718,237 and taxes of $298,495 in
1986; and gross earnings of $919,566 and taxes of $211,411 in 1987.
   The senator's doctor, Antonio M. Gotto Jr. of Houston, examined
Bentsen in April and said results were ``completely normal with the
exception of a slight elevation of systolic blood pressure to 148
and two small lesions on the skin.''
   A followup examination found Bentsen's blood pressure was normal
and the skin lesions had disappeared.
   Gotto told Bentsen in a letter released as part of the report
that he had a cholesterol count of 245.
   In October, government guidelines said that cholesterol counts
of 245 milligrams per decaliter are considered ``high risk.''
   Gotto said in the letter that after Bentsen used a low dose of
Lovastatin, a drug to lower cholesterol, for about one month, the
cholesterol level was reduced to 200, a level the government
guidelines say is desirable.
   ``I am very pleased with this response to the medication as well
as with the overall state of your health,'' Gotto said.

   Vice President George Bush today defended his
description of his three Mexican-American grandchildren as ``the
little brown ones,'' saying ``this heart knows nothing but pride
and love'' for the children.
   ``For anyone to suggest that that comment of pride is anything
other than what it was, I find it personally offensive,'' Bush said
at a news conference with his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana.
   Bush on Tuesday introduced his grandchildren to President Reagan
at a brief airport meeting.
   ``These are Jebby's kids from Florida, the little brown ones,''
the vice president said.
   The three youngsters _ Jeb Jr., Noelle, and George P. _ are the
children of Bush's son, Jeb, and his Mexican-born wife, Columba.
   ``Those grandchildren are my pride and joy and when I say pride,
I mean it,'' Bush said today.
   ``I don't want to see these kids hurt and they weren't hurt by
what I said and if they're hurt by misinterpretation, that isn't
fair and I don't like it, he said.
   ``This is my family and I'm going to protect them ... this heart
knows nothing but pride and love for those three children and
you're going to see them with me every inch of the way.''
   Bush's ``little brown ones'' comment drew a mixed reaction among
Hispanic Americans.
   Roy Barrera Jr., a Hispanic delegate to the Republican National
Convention from San Antonio, Texas, said Bush's comment was a
``remark of sincere affection'' that shouldn't be taken out of
context.
   ``All my discussions with the Bushes has led me to believe that
George Bush cherishes the uniqueness of his family, has an
overwhelming love and affection for his grandchildren, Jeb's
children,'' said Barrera, who accompanied the Bush family on their
riverboat ride on Tuesday.
   The former district judge said there is ``nothing at all vulgar
or insidious or disrespectful about being brown or being black. It
is simply just a description.''
   In Los Angeles, Al Belmontez, vice president of one of the local
labor chapters of the Mexican-American Political Association, said
Bush's remark reflected insensitivity.
   ``Just saying that means he knows they're different. He didn't
say `those are my grandchildren.' He didn't just refer to the kids
by their names,'' Belmontez said in a telephone interview. ``That
just shows that he's ... insensitive.''
   Belmontez said it was unlikely the remark would affect Bush's
standing with members of his own party.
   ``Republicans will support him no matter what,'' Belmontez said.
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, Bush's campaign chairman,
told reporters, ``The vice president is extremely proud of the fact
that his grandchildren are 50 percent Hispanic.''
   Bush has often bragged about the family, which lives in
Tallahassee, Fla.
   George P. Bush, 13, gave the pledge of allegiance at Tuesday's
session of the convention.

<TEXT>
   Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, who seized power
in military coup 11 years ago and became Pakistan's longest serving
president, ruled with an iron hand that bore the stamp of Islam.
   Zia, a strong U.S. ally, died today when his military plane
exploded just after taking off from Bahawalpur, 330 miles southwest
of Islamabad. He was 64.
   The career military officer strongly supported Afghan guerrillas
in their struggle against the Soviet-backed Marxist government of
Afghanistan. Recently, the Soviets told him to stop allowing arms
for the rebels to pass through Pakistan while the Soviets withdraw
their troops.
   Zia kept up his nation's military strength to guard tense
borders with neighboring India. He managed to retain control over
the armed forces, which had staged several successful coups since
Pakistan was created as an Islamic nation in 1947.
   But in recent months, he has faced increasingly unified
opposition, led by Benazir Bhutto, the daughter of former Prime
Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who Zia arrested and executed after
taking power.
   Zia, who was a general, resisted a cult of personality and did
not permit his portrait to hang in government offices or public
places, unlike Pakistan's previous military leaders. He was married
and had five children.
   He was also the country's first head of state to use Pakistan's
national language, Urdu, at all state functions. He also encouraged
officials in his government to wear national dress.
   Zia took power from Bhutto in 1977, arrested the Cabinet and
proclaimed martial law. Two years later, he ordered his predecessor
executed on charges of conspiracy to murder. Under his
authoritarian rule, mass arrests and floggings were frequent.
   In an interview earlier this month, Zia said he ruled
reluctantly.
   ``Really, you can say that. A reluctant ruler. But I am not a
person to just give up in disgust and walk away. I am determined to
stay here until I solve all of the many problems that continue to
face our country.''
   He was born into a middle-class family on Aug. 12, 1924 at
Jallunder, in what is now India's Punjab state. He became a devout
Moslem in his youth, and later instituted Islamic laws when in
power.
   In June, Zia issued a presidential decree making Islamic law
supreme, bringing much of Pakistani life under the supervision of
Islamic scholars and priests. ``His great passion in life is
Islam,'' said a close aide.
   His rule was helped by geopolitics and luck: the Soviet
intervention in Afghanistan in 1979 led to more Western aid, and
good harvests brought more food in the early 1980s.
   In recent months, however, he has had to work a political high
wire act to quell the unprecedented opposition challenge by Ms.
Bhutto and others.
   Last month, Zia announced ``free fair and impartial'' national
elections would be held in November. But he later issued election
rules that restricted opposition campaigning.
   Several Pakistani and Western analysts said the shrewd leader
had believed that running the country was not duty but destiny.
   ``It's not important what people say about you now,'' Zia said
in a 1983 interview. ``But what history remembers after you've
gone.''
   Ms. Bhutto, leader of the opposition Pakistan People's Party,
said from her Karachi home: ``Life and death is in the hand of God.
We will not say anything.''
   U.S. officials praised Zia as a strong ally of the United States.
   Vice President George Bush said Pakistan and the United States
``have a very special relationship and the loss of Gen. Zia is a
great tragedy.'' His comment came in New Orleans, the site of the
Republican Party convention.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
Zia and Raphel had gone down to the remote area in southwestern
Pakistan to view a field demonstration of the U.S.-made M-1 tank
Pakistan was thinking of buying.
   Jeane Kirkpatrick, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
today said Zia's death raises doubts about Pakistan's ability to
support the Afghan rebels. ``Zia was a very strong person,'' she
said, also from the convention.
   He was ``very important to the whole geopolitical strategic
constellation of the region, very important to the freedom fighters
of Afghanistan.''

   Here is a transcript of the news conference
Wednesday by Vice President George Bush and Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana.
   Bush: I have a brief opening statement and then I'll ask Senator
Quayle to make a comment or two and then I'll be glad to take
questions and so will he.
   The first thing I want to do is just say how horrible I feel
about that tragedy in Pakistan this morning. As most of you know,
the government of Pakistan announced the death of President Zia. He
was a friend of mine and Barbara's and been extraordinarily
hospitable to us on more than one occasion.
   What it was was a transport plane of the Pakistan air force
carrying him and our ambassador, Arnie Raphel, and it exploded this
morning, 7:30 a.m., our time, Eastern Daylight Time.
   A second American, not, may not confirm, also was lost in the
incident.
   The government of Pakistan has formed an advisory council to
oversee the transition following President Zia's death. An acting
president has been appointed.
   Pakistan and the United States have a very special relationship
and the loss of General Zia is a great tragedy.
   Our ambassador, Arnie Raphel, an outstanding ambassador. I knew
him well, and Barbara and I express our most sincere regrets to the
families.
   After the excitement of yesterday, I wanted to give everybody a
chance to meet our unified Republican ticket.
   Senator Quayle is one of the rising stars in the Republican
Party. In fact the National Journal called him a Senate success
story.
   And I asked him to be my running mate for three main reasons:
   First, and most importantly, he's qualified. He's distinguished
himself in the Senate as the author of the Job Training Partnership
Act. He's an expert on defense and national security. And he's
worked hard to increase our farm exports. He knows the agricultural
business well.
   And secondly, we agree on the fundamental challenges that face
this country _ how to create jobs by keeping taxes low, how to keep
America strong and secure as we work for peace, and how to create
opportunities for American families.
   And while a Midwesterner, I believe he will help our cause in
every part of the country because he understands that what's
important in this campaign is not only what we've accomplished, but
what we will accomplish in the future.
   As his own record of electoral success shows, he's not only an
excellent senator, but an excellent campaigner as well. He's done
very, very well. And I am pleased and excited to introduce the next
vice president of the United States, Sen. Dan Quayle.

   Here are some facts and figures on Pakistan:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Pakistan covers 310,403 square miles, about twice the
size of California. The southern Asian country, considered
strategically important to the United States, borders India, China,
Afghanistan and Iran. It also has a coastline on the Arabian Sea.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Pakistan's 102 million people come from three main
ethnic groups: Punjabis, the most numerous, and the Pathans in the
northwest and Baluchis in the west. Urdu is the official language,
although English is widely used. About 98 percent of the population
are Moslems, and a presidential decree in June brought much of
Pakistani life under the supervision of Islamic scholars and
priests.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Agriculture dominates Pakistan's economy, and
principal crops are wheat, rice, cotton and sugarcane. The nation
exports texiles and produces chemicals, steel, natural gas and
cement. There is some mining for iron ore.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Aryans, Persians, Greeks, Arabs and Turks conquered
the region before it became part of British India in 1857. In 1947,
the colony was divided into the Hindu-dominated nation of India and
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. One of Pakistan's two parts, East
Pakistan, became the separate country of Bangladesh in 1971.
   Pakistan stations tens of thousands of troops alongside its
tense 1,836-mile border with India, site of three wars in the past
41 years. A U.N. observer force has manned a stretch of the border
in the disputed Kashmir-Jammu region since 1949.
   On July 5, 1977, Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq took power from Prime
Minister Ali Bhutto. The army commander arrested Bhutto and ordered
his execution in 1979. Zia imposed martial law until 1985, when he
restored basic rights and appointed a civilian Cabinet. In May, he
fired the civilian government, saying it had failed to maintain law
and order and to enact Islamic law. Two months later, he announced
general elections would be held in November.

   A man who took three hostages at a
county courthouse and threatened to blow the building up
surrendered today, after releasing his captives and reporting that
his wife killed herself, police said.
   Kevin Patrick Firth, 30, was taken into custody at 9:15 a.m.,
Police Sgt. Greg Kuhn said.
   Authorities were uncertain, pending an autopsy, whether Helen
Firth shot herself or was shot by her husband, Mesa County District
Attorney Steve ErkenBrack said.
   ``She's gone. Helen's shot,'' said Firth told police earlier
this morning.
   Police said Mrs. Firth had smuggled guns and possibly explosives
into the Mesa County Courthouse Tuesday just before her husband
faced a hearing in a sexual assault case.
   After Firth surrendered, a bomb squad began searching the
courthouse but didn't immediately find any explosives. ErkenBrack
said hostages had reported seeing wire, tape and round objects
inside the courthouse. ``There apparently was something there to
make the hostages believe there were explosives,'' he said.
   The last of the hostages had been released three hours before
Firth reported the shooting. Firth would not permit a doctor to
enter the building.
   Firth appeared willing to give up at about 3:30 a.m. but his
wife balked and threatened many times to detonate explosives she
had smuggled into the two-story building.
   At 5:10 a.m., Firth reported his wife had shot herself. When
negotiators tried to calm him down, he said, ``I can't. I've got to
be with her. It's too late.''
   After several minutes, negotiator John Hakes asked Firth to call
on the telephone, but Firth refused and said: ``Get everybody off
or I'll blow this ... building. Helen's about gone.''
   Later in the morning, Firth agreed to negotiate by telephone.
The last thing he was heard saying over the radio was: ``Why did
you push her? Was time all that important?''
   Police refused to report the substance of telephone
conversations between negotiators and Firth.
   All business was canceled at the courthouse today and businesses
facing the courthouse were asked not to open.
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' said Sheila Shumway, a court
clerk who was the first hostage released on Tuesday. ``I blame that
on the county commissioners. We begged and begged for security and
it's always been money to them. Maybe they'll do something now.
   ``I'm not going to work there again until they get me some
security. I wasn't hired to wear a bullet-proof shield,'' she said
in a telephone interview today.
   Tuesday's ordeal began as Firth's handcuffs were taken off prior
to a pre-trial hearing. Mrs. Firth pushed a jailer and handed her
husband a semi-automatic pistol, keeping a second for herself.
   They took as hostages clerks Joyce Bailey and Shumway and
receptionist Linda Romersberger. Shumway was released about noon,
and Romersberger was freed about 8 p.m.
   During the ordeal, police said Firth, 30, made no demands,
except to talk with investigators about the sexual assault case
against him.
   As the night wore on, Firth approached the brink of releasing
his captives several times, but changed his mind when he heard
noises, such as the air conditioning system and nearby trains, or
saw shadows flickering on the walls.
   Negotiators spoke with Firth on a police radio that he had
obtained from a jailer in the courtroom.
   About 40 courthouse employees, including two judges, their
families and news reporters huddled around police scanners in a
darkened parking lot across the street from the courthouse as the
drama unfolded.
   Police shut off the street lights and cordoned off the building
for a block on all sides in the belief that Firth may have wired
the top floor of the courthouse with explosives.
   When Firth decided to free Bailey just before 2 a.m., he could
be heard on the police radio saying, ``There's a charge in one of
these filing cabinets in front of the door ... and something inside
it fell. If these wires aren't touching, I'm in trouble.''
   Firth, an auto mechanic, was released from prison in October
after serving time on a rape conviction.
   He was arrested March 8 and charged with first-degree sexual
assault and kidnapping in the Feb. 24 attack on a grocery store
employee.
   In 1981, when he was a soldier stationed at Fort Carson in
Colorado Springs, Firth was sentenced to serve eight years on a
rape conviction, Department of Corrections officials said.

<HEAD>Black South African Homeland in Turmoil Over Ritual Murders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tiny black homeland of
Venda in South Africa's northeast corner is in turmoil because of
ritual murders and allegations that officials have tried to cover
them up.
   Thousands of students have boycotted classes for two weeks,
demanding the justice minister be fired, and workers joined the
protest Tuesday with a general strike that continues, affecting
government offices, public transport, shops and factories.
   President Frank Ravele said after an emergency Cabinet meeting
Tuesday that Alfred Tshivhase had been dismissed as justice
minister to ``restore law and order'' but would be kept on as
minister without portfolio.
   Police in Venda confirm four ritual murders have been committed
this year and are being investigated, but have not disclosed
details. They deny charges of a cover-up made by student and
community leaders who claim the true number of killings is 15.
   Ritual murder is a term used in Africa to describe killings in
which parts of bodies are cut off, ground up and used as an
ingredient in potions. Children are the most frequent victims.
   The South African Foreign Ministry said Tuesday there had been
false rumors of a coup in Venda. Reports of political turbulence in
the homeland have circulated since Patrick Mphephu, the
authoritarian president, died in April after nearly 30 years in
power.
   Venda is two-thirds the size of Lebanon and its population is
about 500,000, many of them migrant workers whose jobs are far from
the territory. It is one of four black homelands designated as
independent by South Africa but not recognized abroad.
   A coup attempt failed earlier this year in Bophuthatswana, one
of the homelands, and a coup succeeded last year in another,
Transkei.
   Venda was declared independent in 1979 and human rights groups
have described its government as ruthless in suppressing political
dissent.
   The Sowetan, South Africa's largest black-oriented daily
newsdpaper, reported Wednesday that suspects in two of the four
confirmed ritual murder cases were connected with the government.
   It said a member of the legislature was accused of killing an
18-year-old woman but freed when the attorney general declined to
prosecute, and a man working for the director of intelligence
services had been arrested in the murder of a baby.
   No official information has been released about motives for the
murders.
   The Sowetan said many students involved in the classroom boycott
have been arrested and fellow protesters were demanding their
release.
   Another South African newspaper, The Star, said Wednesday that
students submitted a statement to police alleging that Tshivhase,
the justice minister, was linked to the death last month of a
32-year-old high school teacher.

<HEAD>Vice President Saddened by Loss of Zia, U.S. Ambassador</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush said today the
military plane crash that killed Pakistani President Mohammed Zia
ul-Haq and the American ambassador in Pakistan was a ``great
tragedy.''
   Bush, making a brief statement about today's crash before a news
conference with Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, his newly named running
mate, revealed that a second American, as yet unidentified, died in
the crash with Ambassador Arnold Raphel. No one among the 37 people
aboard were believed to have survived.
   Bush said he wanted to express ``how horrible I feel about the
tragedy in Pakistan.'' in which a C-130 transport plane exploded
just after takeoff from Bahawalpur, about 330 miles southwest of
the capital of Islamabad.
   ``Pakistan and the United States have a very special relationshp
and the loss of General Zia is a great tragedy,'' he said. He also
called Raphel, 45, an ``outstanding ambassador. ... I knew him
well.''
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said the death of Zia was a
``severe blow to Pakistan and to our policy'' in the region.
   Although Humphrey said the ``circumstances are suspicious''
surrounding the crash, he did not have enough information to say it
was sabotage. Conflicting reports from Pakistan speculated the
plane might have been struck by an anti-aircraft missile.
   Humphrey was a key supporter in Congress of the Afghan rebels
who battled Soviet troops during their occupation of Afghanistan,
and U.S. aid to the rebels was channeled through Pakistan.
   Humphrey called Zia ``a courageous bulwark'' who ``withstood the
bullying,'' including aerial attacks from the Soviets. Where it not
for Zia, he said, ``Afghanistan would be part of the Soviet
empire.''

   Sen. Dan Quayle, the conservative baby boomer
who will be George Bush's running mate, today defended his
qualifications to be president and said there was ``nothing to'' a
weekend that he and other congressmen spent with a Washington
lobbyist.
   The Indiana Republican also said it was a ``cheap shot'' for
anyone to criticize his entering the National Guard during the
Vietnam War.
   And the 41-year-old senator, named as his No. 2 by Bush on
Tuesday, said he is not as wealthy as some reports have suggested.
One story that put his net worth at $200 million has ``caused me a
lot of problems at home because my wife is asking about that,'' he
joked.
   In a joint news conference with Bush, Quayle, a relative unknown
on the national political horizon, faced a barrage of questions as
he began the process of introducing himself to American voters.
   Bush aides have tried to compare Quayle with John F. Kennedy,
who galvanized young voters nearly three decades ago. Bush called
Quayle ``a man of the future.''
   Bush insisted Quayle was the best candidate to be his vice
presidential nominee, but Quayle was pressed on his presidential
qualifications.
   ``I have spent 12 years in the Congress,'' Quayle said. ``I know
perahps as much about national security as anybody with few
exceptions ... The Senate Armed Services Committee and my national
security background gives me a very important background,'' he
said. Should an accident befall the president, Quayle said he would
know ``what needs to be done to preserve the freedoms and
opportunity in this country.''
   He added that he worked in executive positions in state
government before going to Congress, including one as the chief
inheritance tax officer for the state.
   ``I was known as the chief grave robber of the state,'' he said.
   Quayle gave terse answers to questions about his relationship
with Paula Parkinson, a Washington lobbyist who was on a golfing
trip in 1980 with Quayle and two other congressmen. Quayle has
previously denied any sexual relationship with Parkinson, a
statement he would not expand on.
   ``That has been covered and there is nothing to it,'' he said.
   Asked if he had ever seen Parkinson on other occasions, Quayle
said, ``No.''
   Quayle objected to suggestions that he had ducked military
service in VIetnam by joining the National Guard in 1969.
   ``I do perceive that as being a cheap shot. I have a deep
affection for those men and women who sacrificed their lives in
Vietnam. For anybody to imply anything differently is just not
true,'' he said.
   Quayle also denied stories painting him as a very wealthy man.
His relatives and a family trust own newspapers in Indiana and
Arizona.
   Asked if Quayle was worth $200 million, Bush cut in to joke:
``Why do you think I chose him?''
   Quayle tried to also give a light answer to the question:
   ``That figure is not correct. Believe me, you have caused me a
lot of problems at home because my wife is asking about that.''
   Both men said they would disclose their finances fully.
   The choice of Quayle, 41, a telegenic politician whose career
rise has been meteoric, brought stunned silence and then applause
from supporters who watched Bush make the announcement Tuesday
after days of suspense. Conservatives said they were pleased by the
choice.
   Quayle bounced up and down on his toes at the riverfront area
where Bush's tour boat had cruised to greet supporters, and could
hardly contain his enthusiasm. ``Let's go get 'em!'' he shouted.
   Sheila Tate, Bush's press secretary, said Quayle was Bush's
``first choice, his only choice'' for the ticket's No. 2 spot. He
was picked over about a dozen hopefuls, whom Bush personally
notified from Belle Chasse Naval Air Station before phoning Quayle
at his hotel at 2:06 p.m., aides said.
   Bush and Quayle enjoy a warm relationship and talk often by
telephone or in Bush's office in the Old Executive Office Building.
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who polled Senate Republicans at
Bush's request two weeks ago, said Quayle was not among those they
recommended for the spot. But when McConnell gave Bush the
recommendations, Bush asked, ``What about Dan Quayle?''
   Quayle is relatively unknown on the national stage, but he
quickly seized the moment at Tuesday's riverfront festivities, his
right hand chopping the air in a gesture reminiscent of Kennedy.
   ``George Bush's America believes and has the commitment to the
American family that is so important to all of us,'' he said, his
voice rising to a shout. ``George Bush's America understands the
problems that confront us and can lead us to the future and the
21st century.''
   Quayle is married to the former Marilyn Tucker, a lawyer, and
they have three children, the oldest 14. He comes from a prominent
Indiana newspaper family and is the grandson of the late Eugene C.
Pulliam, a multimillionaire publisher.
   Quayle made no major marks in two terms in the House before his
Senate bid, defeating incumbent Democrat Birch Bayh in 1980 and
winning re-election handily in 1986.
   In the Senate, Quayle has not attained the stature of his senior
Indiana colleague, Richard Lugar. But in choosing Quayle, Bush
opted for someone with whom he felt comfortable rather than someone
with instant name recognition.
   James A. Baker III, Bush's new campaign chairman, said the
choice was ``a bold stroke across generations'' and predicted that
those Republicans who don't now back Quayle ``will be enthusiastic
supporters of his'' once they ``look at his record and see him
perform.''
   Robert Teeter, Bush's pollster, said Quayle should strengthen
the ticket in the Midwest, where Bush ran poorly in the primaries,
and also help bridge the celebrated gender gap problem Bush has
with women voters.

<HEAD>Dukakis On The Road For Final Days Of GOP Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VIRGINIA, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis began a four-day
campaign swing hoping to steal some of the spotlight from the
Republican National Convention with a midday rally in this Iron
Range town.
   Before addressing several thousand people at a community college
stadium, he told a welcoming gathering at the airport in nearby
Hibbing that Minnesota ``has always been very good'' to Democrats,
``and I hope and expect to have a nice victory here in November.''
   Appearing with him at the community college rally were former
Vice President Walter Mondale, the Democrats' 1984 presidential
nominee, and state Attorney General Skip Humphrey, son of the late
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey.
   From here, he was flying to Minneapolis for a private reception
and then Miami for an address Thursday to a Greek organization.
   Dukakis spent Monday and Tuesday on a tour of central
Massachusetts but interrupted his busy schedule of state events
long enough to turn Reagan's ``facts are stubborn things'' refrain
on the Republicans and their certain nominee, Vice President George
Bush.
   ``Facts are stubborn things,'' Dukakis agreed as he listed facts
he said Republicans are failing to acknowledge at their convention:
increases in the national crime rate and the federal trade and
budget deficit.
   ``This is a nation that eight years ago was the largest creditor
nation in the world,'' Dukakis said in Worcester. ``Today we are
the largest debtor nation in the world. That's the consequence of
eight years of borrowing and spending and borrowing and spending.
Facts are stubborn things and these are the facts we are going to
be debating. ... It will be Mr. Bush who will have to respond to
those facts.''
   He then shifted to foreign policy but kept the refrain, first
used by Reagan in his address to the Republican convention Monday
night, as he reeled off a list of Reagan administration
embarrassments.
   ``Iran-Contra. Noriega. Beirut,'' Dukakis said. ``Facts are
stubborn things.''
   Dukakis said he expected the GOP convention would help Bush cut
into his lead in the polls but predicted the effect would not be
lasting and that Reagan would not be a major factor.
   ``Things will settle down,'' Dukakis said. ``This is an election
between Michael Dukakis and George Bush. The question (voters) are
going to be asking themselves is which one of us has the ability to
lead.''
   Dukakis also had his own interpretation of another remark from
the Reagan speech _ the president's assertion that Bush should be
elected because the nation could not afford to have a president who
would need ``on-the-job-training.''
   Said Dukakis: ``The same might have been said of the Republican
nominee in 1980,'' referring to Reagan, the former California
governor. ``None of us comes to the presidency with on-the-job
training, least of all vice presidents,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis also said he was not bothered by the harsh criticism of
him at the Republican convention.
   ``If you went through what I went through in the mid-70s, it's a
day at the beach,'' said Dukakis, who was voted out of office in
1978 after countering a budget crisis by slashing welfare benefits
and raising taxes in his first term. He returned to office in 1983.
   Dukakis said he spoke to former rival Jesse Jackson on Wednesday
and that he expected a joint campaign appearance soon. ``It's going
to be a close relationship,'' Dukakis said.
   After the Miami event Thursday morning, Dukakis is scheduled to
travel to Alabama and spend the night in St. Louis. Friday's
schedule includes stops in Illinois, Arkansas and Texas, where
Dukakis also is to spend Saturday campaigning with running mate
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.

   Quayle: Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.
   And it's certainly a great honor and believe me I am excited
about getting going out on the campaign trail and taking the issues
of the Reagan-Bush era and looking toward the George Bush America
that will simply keep this country moving forward.
   We have peace and prosperity. We have to keep peace and

Act that reached out and has put millions of people to work in
America.
   I believe in education, and we've worked hard on the Labor and
Human Resources Committee to provide those education opportunities.
   I've worked on the Senate Armed Services Committee as chairman
of the defense procurement subcommittee, to make sure that the
Packard reforms were implemented, to bring about competitiveness.
   And I also believe very strongly in investment in national
defense, in investment in national defense and particularly moving
forward with the Strategic Defense Initiative so we can defend
America.
   But my excitement, not only personally for the vice president,
but for the values and principles that he stands for. He stands for
what is the best in America and we are going to go out and to
articulate the hope, the opportunity for those families, the hope
and opportunity to preserve freedom and the hope and the
opportunity for our future.
   Thank you for placing your confidence in me.

   Federal, state and local officials
today arrested several people in three states on federal
indictments involving drug trafficking and at least $1.6 million in
stolen property, authorities said.
   Sealed federal indictments returned Monday name 105 people in
West Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio, said state Trooper Ric Robinson.
Authorities did not give a specific number of people arrested today.
   A source, who agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity,
said the majority of the cases involve the theft of heavy equipment
and parts for heavy equipment, while a handful focus on drug
trafficking.
   The investigation began in 1986 by FBI and West Virginia state
police, dubbed ``Operation Mine Stopper,'' involves theft of
weapons, cars, motorcycles, four-wheel drives, washers, dryers and
a variety of heavy equipment, Robinson said.
   Several people were arrested and taken to the federal Magistrate
Court in Huntington this morning, authorities said. About one-third
of the federal building was blocked off to the public and state
police cruisers transporting defendants took over all public
parking on the block.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Savage, who represented prosecutors
at the arraignments this morning, declined to comment on the
arrests.
   ``This investigation will continue over the coming months and
many more arrests are expected,'' said West Virginia state police
Col. W.F. Donohoe. ``Several hundred crimes have been involved with
these arrests.''
   About 125 law enforcement officers were making arrests,
authorities said.

<HEAD>Electoral College Has Midwest Tilt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By selecting Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle as his
running mate, George Bush has reached out to a region whose voters
have more clout than anyone else.
   Thanks to the nation's changing population, it will take fewer
Midwestern votes to win delegates to the Electoral College than in
any other region of the nation.
   Electoral College support is hardest to come by, on the other
hand, in the South, home to Democratic vice presidential nominee
Lloyd Bentsen, and also claimed by the GOP's Bush.
   This is the case because, despite the one-person, one-vote
theory, Americans don't elect their presidents directly. Instead
they elect delegates to the Electoral College, who in turn actually
pick the president and vice president.
   And the number of delegates each state gets in the Electoral
College is based on the total number of senators and
representatives that state has in Congress. Every state has two
senators, while seats in the House are readjusted according to
population after each national census.
   That means that for this election, representation in the
Electoral College is based on the 1980 national head count _ even
though massive changes have occurred as people moved from state to
state.
   The South has the most electoral votes at 177 this year,
followed by 137 in the Midwest, 113 in the West and 111 in the
Northeast. The Census Bureau estimates that, as of July 1, 1987,
the South had 63,032,000 residents aged 18 and over. Second was the
Midwest at 43,952,000; the Northeast with 38,402,000 and the West
at 37,242,000.
   That means each electoral vote in the Midwest represents 320,817
voters, the fewest of any region and thus giving them the most
clout as individuals when they do to the polls.
   The Western voter comes next in influence, with each elector
representing 335,513 voters. Each elector from the Northeast
represents 339,841 voters, while in the South the ratio is 356,112
voters per electoral vote.
   Thus each voter in the Midwest has 11 percent more influence on
the election than someone going to the polls in the South.

<HEAD>Bourbon Street Courts GOP, But Turnout Unimpressive</HEAD>

   Bourbon Street is courting Republicans, but
snugly sealed GOP pocketbooks and free diversions elsewhere have
made the exotic avenue a spurned suitor.
   Bar and food tabs are paltry, tips are tiny and seats are empty
in many Bourbon Street clubs and restaurants, proprietors complain.
   Money and morals are factors, they speculate, along with the
Republican National Convention's late-night schedule that leaves
many conventioneers too pooped to party in the French Quarter.
   ``I've always kind of wanted to see Bourbon Street, and now I
have,'' said Alex Day, 19, a former Pat Robertson supporter from
Litchfield, Ky. ``I've seen enough. I'm going back to the hotel.''
   Young Republicans have spent the most money, club owners said in
interviews. Older party members ``haven't been spending as much as
even other kinds of convention-goers,'' said Harold Tannenbaum,
manager of the Krazy Korner bar on Bourbon Street.
   ``They are not much in the way of tipping,'' Tannenbaum said.
``The girls have been complaining. They haven't been taking as much
as they usually do.''
   Robin Parks, who minds the door at Ryan's Irish Pub, said the
average tab for four has been $100. ``They're really not spending a
lot of money,'' she said. ``I think the Democrats would have been a
little bit rowdier.''
   Louis Karno has changed closing time at his Famous Door bar to
accomodate the conventioneers. ``Some are coming out really late,
and we're keeping our bands here,'' he said.
   Fred Sullivan, a bartender at Le Booze Bar, said the week's more
than 500 parties, brunches and receptions have hurt Bourbon Street
crowds. ``It's been taking a lot of people off the streets,'' he
said.
   John Fillman, doorman at Chris Owens' club, said he looks for an
upturn once the convention ends Thursday night.
   David Ervin, who sells margaritas and hurricanes from a tiny
stand on Bourbon Street, agreed: ``It's still early. The weekend
hasn't gotten here.''

   ``Moonlighting'' star Bruce Willis and
actress Demi Moore named their day-old daughter Rumer Glenn, a
spokesman for Willis said Wednesday.
   The infant and her mother were fine, Paul Bloch said here
Wednesday.
   ``Both are fine and back home (in Kentucky) and Bruce is already
back at work,'' he said.
   The 8-pound, 1-ounce girl was delivered at a Paducah, Ky.,
hospital Tuesday, Bloch said. The baby measured 21{ inches long.
   Willis, 33, and Miss Moore, 25, were married in November 1987
and live in Malibu. Miss Moore recently joined Willis on location
in Kentucky, where Willis is filming the Warner Bros. drama ``In
Country,'' described as a portrait of a family struggling to heal
the wounds of the Vietnam War.
   Willis is scheduled to resume his ``Moonlighting'' duties as the
wisecracking detective opposite Cybill Shepherd in October.
   Miss Moore, who launched her career in the soap opera ``General
Hospital,'' has appeared in such films as ``St. Elmo's Fire'' and
``About Last Night.''

<TEXT>
   A string of Republican luminaries from
certain nominee George Bush on down ridiculed Democratic nominee
Michael Dukakis' farm policies Wednesday, the day after ``a son of
the Midwest'' was picked for the No. 2 spot on the GOP ticket.
   Bush, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole and Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng took aim at a ``Belgian endive'' comment
that's dogged Dukakis since the early days of the campaign.
   Dukakis got in trouble when he suggested that farmers could
diversify their crops, in part by growing Belgian endive.
   ``I don't think that Belgian endive is the answer to American
agriculture,'' Bush told a breakfast for farm-state Republicans.
``My wife likes Belgian endive, but I hate them.''
   ``Poor Michael, he can't be blamed,'' Lyng said. ``He grew up in
the city and he doesn't know the difference between Belgian endive
and corn.''
   ``I thought it was part of his foreign policy,'' said Dole.
   Bush tabbed Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle to be his running mate, and
there was instant speculation that the selection would bolster
Republican chances in the Midwest, where recession and drought have
hurt Bush.
   Bush lost a series of primary and caucus contests in the
Midwest, before clinching the nomination. Some polls have suggested
that Dukakis is ahead in the traditionally Republican Farm Belt.
   The selection of Quayle clearly buoyed the spirits of the
Midwesterners, and Bush and former rival Dole were upbeat about
Republican chances.
   ``It's certainly an indication that he understands the
importance of rural America,'' Dole said.
   ``I am an optimist about agricultural America,'' Bush said.
``Main street is not going to dry up under a George Bush
administration. As president, I am pledged to helping rural
America.''
   And Bush wasn't subtle about how the Quayle selection would fit
into that effort.
   ``I have suggested to the convention that a son of the Midwest
be on our ticket and Dan Quayle will be working hard to carry the
message,'' Bush said.

   Bush: Thanks, Dan.
   Now.
   Q. Can you really say to the nation today that Senator Quayle,
young and so relatively inexperienced, especially compared to you,
sir, is prepared to be a heartbeat away from the presidency?
   Bush: Yes, I can.
   His record is outstanding.
   Yes, he's young, and that's a tremendous asset.
   He'll have broad appeal for the election.
   But in terms of being a heartbeat away, I've listened since I've
named him as the likely nominee, since I've recommended to the
national convention that he be nominated for that job, I've
listened to his peers and the accolades from the senators with whom
he serves speak eloquently of Dan Quayle's standing to be one
heartbeat away from the presidency.
   Yes.
   Q. Senator, what makes you think you are qualified to become
president in the event something unfortunate should happen to Mr.
Bush? What is it that you have that would make you qualified?
   Quayle: Well, I have spent 12 years in the Congress.
   I know perhaps as much about national security as anybody, with
few exceptions.
   I've worked hard, particularly on the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee and my national security
background gives me a very important background for if some
accident would befall the president to have an understanding about
what needs to be done to preserve the freedoms and the
opportunities in this country.
   I feel prepared.

   Pat Robertson passed the remnants of his
failed presidential campaign to George Bush with spirit and gusto,
but reserved the right to make another bid for the White House.
   Throughout the convention week, Robertson held meetings with
delegations from states where he scored well in this year's series
of primaries, urging them to be ``good Republicans'' and jump into
this year's election with a vengeance.
   ``I want George Bush to win,'' Robertson said at one point.
   And what impact would that have on his own future?
   ``I'm a young guy, I can wait eight years,'' said the
58-year-old television evangelist.
   His supporters said that's just fine with them, and many are
finding ways to play a role in this year's election to show their
resolve.
   ``We're not a bunch of loonies,'' said Ann Kincaid, who ran
Robertson's Virginia campaign, but now works for Bush. ``It has to
do with the maturity of what we're doing.''
   Robertson had long been out of the running for the GOP
presidential nomination, but his role in the party far exceeded the
88 delegates still loyal when he released them Tuesday night.
   He was awarded a prime-time spot on the convention's podium, and
even drew a member of the Bush family when he decided to formally
throw in the towel. A sharply conservative platform approved by the
delegates reflected his stamp.
   Even Bush's choice of conservative Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana as
a running mate left Robertson elated.
   ``On issues like school prayer and abortion ... he is right down
the line with evangelicals,'' Robertson said.
   His backers were taking that cue.
   ``I'm comfortable to know that I'm part of this party,'' said
John Rondeno, a New Orleans activist who ran a reception center for
Robertson delegates. ``When you're outside, you have no influence.
Sometimes you have to rebuild the foundation.''
   The only surprise, backers argued, was how quickly they've been
able to make the transition.
   ``I expected a little tug and a little struggle, but there
wasn't,'' said Robertson spokeswoman Marlene Elwell.
   ``That shows it's not just a man-centered thing,'' Mrs. Kincaid
said. ``Pat woke them up, shook them up and pasted them to the
Republican Party. That's not something that's going to go away.''
   Just as Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis worked to win over
Jesse Jackson without appearing too closely allied, Bush's forces
quietly courted the fundamentalists.
   Robertson capped it with a ringing endorsement before a packed
and cheering convention, and a national television audience. There
are challenges for both sides.
   Along the way, Robertson committed occasional gaffes that raised
eyebrows and doubts. At a news conference Wednesday, he was asked
what he learned about his evangelical base.
   ``I learned they were not a monolithic group,'' Robertson said.
``The second thing I learned was that if they had supported me in
the strength that the black people supported Jesse Jackson, I would
be standing on the platform tomorrow night.''
   In essence, the Robertson forces must show they are capable of
delivering. Mrs. Kincaid said there are spirited races across her
state, and the Robertson forces must demonstrate they can turn out
the vote or risk being labeled paper tigers.
   ``We've got to show the state of Virginia we're going to work in
the trenches,'' she said. ``We've got to show the Republican Party
we're in here for the principles and the philosophy and not just
the man.''
   Bush, however, will face pressure to adhere to the sharply
conservative views that Robertson espoused through the end of his
campaign, right to the floor of the convention.
   Robertson's carried out his part of the bargain with a ringing
endorsement and call to action, coupled with one of the
convention's sharpest attacks on Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.
   ``Michael Dukakis is a card-carrying member of the American
Civil Liberties Union, an organization dedicated to removing all
public affirmation of religious faith in America,'' Robertson said.
``As president, Michael Dukakis will pack the courts with ACLU
radicals.''
   Of Bush.
   ``This party is about to nominate a man that I have come to
respect and admire,'' Robertson told the convention in television
prime time. ``This man can and will lead our nation proudly into
the future.''
   He described Bush as ``a principled conservative.''
   ``I release my delegates and alternates who have come to this
convention and urge you and all of my friends across America to
give your enthusiastic support to our party, our candidates and our
presidential nominee,'' Robertson said.
   ``It matters to us and our children whether we vote Democrat or
whether we vote Republican,'' Robertson said.
   To further that aim, Robertson has established a political
action committee, and Mrs. Kincaid said that will be linked with
PACs in states across the country.
   ``We feel confident it's happening throughout the whole United
States,'' Rondeno said.

<HEAD>Soviet Dance Troupe Opens on Broadway</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The folksy acrobats of the Georgian State Dance
Company energized Broadway's Mark Hellinger Theater, as the troupe
made its first visit to the United States in 18 years.
   The 75-member company is one of the Soviet Union's greatest
cultural gifts, founded in the early 1940s by Nina Ramishvili and
her late husband. Their son, Rengiz Sukhishvili, is artistic
director. Mother and son choreograph, keeping many regional
traditions intact, such as keeping couples apart when they dance
together.
   The airborne antics of the male dancers were dazzling and superb
Tuesday night. Jumping two feet in the air, they tucked in their
feet to do fast double turns, flying to a landing on their knees
and calves.
   The men wore knee pads, which certainly were needed for some of
the other moves they so easily made. Four adolescent boys
demonstrated their dexterity by whirling around the floor with
their weight on their knees.
   The men also were adept at dancing on their toes in some
movements.
   In ``Khorumi,'' a dance in which locations for battle are
scouted, one dancer jumped on the shoulders of another to scan the
territory. It was highly effective.
   Anyone who thinks all Eastern European dance companies look
alike will decide differently on seeing the Georgian Dancers. There
are no colorful flying hair ribbons for the women or red embroidery
on dirndl skirts.
   The women are garbed elegantly for every dance. In several they
look like a flock of brides. In one, where three made a triangle
dancing back to back, they're dressed more regally.
   Also, unlike many Eastern European dance steps which involve
hopping, the women in this company do more of a gliding step.
   The emphasis is on smoothness and patterns.
   Costumes, muted but not dull, were beautifully coordinated.
Simon Virsaladze, who designs for the Bolshoi Ballet, is said to
have used the heritage of the Georgian region in the costumes. The
men's costumes favored military coats worn with swords over black
pants.
   The company, on a 12-week U.S. tour, will appear on Broadway
through Sept. 4. It will then go to Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Trenton and
Atlantic City, N.J., and Orlando, Daytona, Sarasota and Clearwater,
Fla.
   James M. Nederlander, in association with Classical Artists
International, produced the Broadway season.

<TEXT>
   The United States today detonated a
nuclear device under this remote desert mesa in a historic test
monitored by Soviet scientists under an agreement allowing both
countries to observe nuclear weapons tests.
   Scientists, diplomats and military officials applauded in the
control center after the nuclear device exploded at 10 a.m.,
causing a ripple on the desert surface at ground zero. The blast
was not felt at the center 30 miles away, where it was observed on
television screens.
   It was the first time Soviet officials had been allowed to
monitor a weapons test at the supersecret Nevada Test Site.
   The nuclear explosive, with a blast nearly 12 times more
powerful than the one that devastated Hiroshima, was buried 2,020
feet into the belly of a secluded, picturesque mesa 130 miles
northwest of Las Vegas.
   The weapon was encased in a steel canister, painted red, white
and blue by workers who planted the device three weeks ago.
   In Las Vegas, people in tall buildings reported the blast caused
some swaying.
   ``Everything appears successful so far,'' said Nick Aquilina,
manager of the Nevada Operations Office, which conducts the
nation's nuclear testing program. The U.S. and Soviet scientists
received the data they wanted, he said.
   In Santa Barbara, Calif., White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater, with President Reagan on vacation, called today's test
``a further positive step which reflects the success of the
administration's practical and measured approach to nuclear
testing.''
   Diplomats who helped forge the agreement in Geneva late last
year gathered at the control point, joining scientists and military
officials who direct the nuclear weapons programs for the two
superpowers.
   At a news conference before the blast, U.S. and Soviet diplomats
who carved out the historic agreement expressed differing opinions
on the cessation of nuclear testing.
   Igor Palenykh, head of the Soviet delegation to the nuclear
testing talks in Geneva, said his country's goal is a total ban on
testing.
   ``I would like to emphasize that endeavor,'' Palenykh said
through an interpreter. ``As far as the Soviet Union is concerned
we are prepared at any time to cease nuclear testing along with the
United States.''
   He referred to the Soviets' 18-month unilateral test moratorium
that ended last year with the resumption of Soviet testing.
   ``Unfortunately, this action of ours has not been appropriately
reciprocated. This doesn't mean we're not willing to resolve this
problem step by step,'' Palenykh said.
   U.S. Ambassador C. Paul Robinson, Palenykh's counterpart at the
nuclear test talks, said the United States believes ``there is a
need for nuclear testing as long as there is a need for nuclear
weapons for national defense.''
   He said it remains to be seen ``how we will accomodate the
differing views on the need for nuclear testing.''
   Robinson said today's test indicates the two countries are
``still making progress for measures for a safer world.''
   The test was designed to measure the ability of each country to
monitor the size of the other's nuclear tests, a requisite in
preventing cheating on treaties signed in 1974 and 1976 limiting
the size of nuclear tests to 150 kilotons.
   Both sides have accused each other of exceeding the limits.
   President Reagan first suggested such a verification test during
a United Nations speech four years ago.
   The test, code named Kearsarge, would be the ninth at the site
this year and the 684th announced blast at the Nevada site since
testing began here in 1951.
   Forty-five Soviet nuclear scientists, engineers and diplomats
were on hand to witness today's blast. A like number of American
scientists will witness a test at the Soviet site at Semipalatinsk
next month.
   Some of the Soviet scientists were in the nearby town of Mercury
when six of the previous U.S. tests were conducted this year, but
today's test was the first one in which they were present.
   One possible hitch was eliminated Monday when a patrolling
Department of Energy helicopter picked up two anti-nuclear
protesters in a remote desert canyon. A spokesman for the
anti-nuclear American Peace Test said the two had planned to hike
to Pahute Mesa to delay today's test.
   Energy Department spokeswoman Barbara Yoerg said the two never
made it to the test site boundaries. They were released on a
highway off the test site without being charged.
   The U.S. and Soviet scientists planned to monitor the blast via
highly-sophisticated equipment housed in unmanned trailers several
hundred yards from ground zero.
   The $25 million test was designed to measure the size of a blast
and was not directly related to a possible test ban, although
scientists and diplomats say the experiment was a critical first
step down that long road.
   Systems to measure the size of an explosion are considered a key
in ratifying the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976
Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty. The pacts limit nuclear tests
to 150 kilotons and both sides have accused the other of exceeding
those limits.
   C. Paul Robinson, the U.S. arms negotiator who helped forge the
test agreement, called the test ``unprecedented,'' the result of a
``breakthrough in negotiations'' between the superpowers. The tests
were agreed to by Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail
Gorbachev at the Washington summit last December.

   So I have a management and executive background, as well.
   Q. Mr. Vice President, now that you've made your choice, what do
you plan to do to narrow this tremendous gender gap that confronts
you?
   Bush: Well, go to work, spell out my views on the issues.
   We've already started with a good agenda, talking about child
care for one, talking about education with specifics for another,
spelled it out a little further with world peace because I think
the women of America are vitally interested in that, have a running
mate who has record of strong appeal to young people and to women
voters in his state because of his record.
   And I think that'll all come together.
   Right here.

<NOTE>Eds: New thruout with bank robbers taking 20 hostages in a bus.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BREMEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armed men who disappeared with two
hostages after a bank robbery in Gladbeck seized a bus with more
than 30 people on board and held them hostage in Bremen today, city
police said.
   Police said the two bandits fired shots out the window of the
bus, but no one was immediately injured.
   In its early evening news broadcast, the ZDF television network
showed the commandeered vehicle at a bus stop in Bremen. It was not
moving. Police officers, their pistols drawn, were shown crouching
behind nearby automobiles.
   ZDF said the robbers were demanding that police give them a
``fast car'' and that they would then release the bus.
   According to a police statement, minutes earlier the two bandits
walked into a Bremen vegetable market and took a woman hostage. The
bandits fired shots inside the market, but no one was hurt, police
said.
   The two men rushed to a nearby bus stop where they commandered
the bus, according to police.
   Early Tuesday, the two men fled a bank in Gladbeck with two bank
employees as hostage, 420,000 marks ($227,000) in cash and a
police-supplied Audi automobile. They fled after holding police at
bay for 14 hours.
   Gladbeck police supplied the car and mos  Reagan learned of Bush's
choice during a whispered conversation
before the president left New Orleans aboard Air Force One.
   ``George has made an excellent choice,'' Reagan said in a
statement issued after the flight.
   Before taking off from Belle Chasse Naval Air Station, Reagan
had a brief meeting with Bush on the tarmac, telling him, ``Nancy
and I want you to know that you have all our support all the way.''
   Aboard the plane, Fitzwater said that Reagan will probably visit
from eight to 15 cities on behalf of the Republican ticket during
September and October. He and the first lady will return to
Washington Sept. 7.
   After their formal airport remarks, Bush was seen to take Reagan
aside at the foot of the ramp before the president boarded the
plane.
   ``He whispered something to him, but I don't know what it was,''
Fitzwater said.
   When reporters asked him to inquire of the president, he went
forward, came back and said that the president did not want to say
what Bush told him.
   When news of the Quayle selection broke after Reagan had arrived
at his ranch north of here, Fitzwater confirmed that Bush had told
the president in the airport conversation.
   ``Vice President Bush has made an outstanding selection,'' the
president said in a formal statement.
   ``He's a proven vote-getter,'' he said. ``I've worked closely
with Dan on a number of issues. He has been a leader in the Senate
for a strong national defense, particularly the Strategic Defense
Initiative and proponent of innovative job creation programs. His
talent, intellect, family, and energy will be valuable assets
during the campaign, and I know he will be a great vice president.''
   Reagan's immediate plans are to relax, ride horseback and do
ranch chores at his 688-acre Rancho del Cielo in the Santa Ynez
Mountains. Fitzwater said he will probably also sign some bills,
probably including trade and fair housing legislation.
   Next Tuesday, he will fly to Los Angeles, with fund-raisers for
Sen. Pete Wilson, Rep. Robert Lagomarsino and the California
Republican Party planned before he returns to the ranch Aug. 27.
Fitzwater said an additional political appearance might be
scheduled during this period. As to the question of more joint
appearances with Bush, the spokesman said there would be some, but
he could not say when.
   Fitzwater said Reagan would watch the convention on television.
There is one television set at the ranch, he said. When Reagan was
last there in July, he watched parts of the Democratic National
Convention, including the acceptance speech of nominee Michael S.
Dukakis.
   The spokesman said Reagan wrote several portions of the speech
he made at the convention Monday night, submitting handwritten
material to speechwriter Ken Khachigian, who produced the final
product.
   He said the president's contributions were especially notable in
the final section of the speech, in which Reagan spoke in emotional
terms of his tenure as president and his thoughts of the future.

   A Coast Guard helicopter pilot landed on
a cliff and helped strap a stranded hiker into a harness to rescue
her from her tiny perch 80 feet above the ocean, officials said.
   ``I'm sure if they hadn't done this it would have been certain
death for the woman, because she was perched in a very precarious
spot,'' Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class Jim Hinde said.
   Letitia Croom, about 50, of Nyssa was hiking Tuesday along the
cliff near Cape Blanco about seven miles north of Port Orford,
Hinde said.
   She apparently slipped off the trail to a ledge, measuring about
2 feet by 2 feet, that was about 80 feet above the ocean, Hinde
said.
   Alerted by the Curry County Sheriff's Department, the Coast
Guard sent a helicopter.
   The helicopter pilot turned over the controls to the co-pilot
and was lowered by hoist to a nearby ledge, where he gave the woman
his helmet and helped her into the hoist harness, Hinde said.
   ``They hoisted her up into the helicopter and then set her down
on the beach,'' Hinde said.
   The woman was uninjured, sheriff's deputy Karen Baker said
Wednesday. ``She's in perfect shape, no injuries whatsoever.''

   New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean is a bigger hit
than Vice President George Bush at the bookstore nearest the
Superdome, where the Republican National Convention is going on.
   ``That's the biggie this week,'' Stephanie Renfro, a saleswoman
at the B. Dalton Bookstore across an elevated walkway from the
Superdome, said as she pointed to ``The Politics of Inclusion.''
   ``What isn't selling is anything about him,'' she said, pointing
to Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis' portrait on the
cover of ``The Man Who Would Be President.''
   ``And also not selling is anything of this negative Reagan
stuff,'' Renfro said, pointing out books by President Reagan's
former press secretary, Larry Speakes; the president's son,
Michael, and his former chief of staff, Donald Regan.
   And ``Looking Forward,'' the autobiography of Vice President
George Bush, the man who will become the Republican nominee later
this week?
   ``It's selling. It's not on fire. But it's steady,'' Renfro said.

   Q. Mr. Vice President, it's been said that in order to win this
fall you have to nail down that part of the Reagan coalition, the
independents, and those people known as the Reagan Democrats. It's
clear Senator Quayle will appeal to the right wing of your party
and to conservatives. How does he help you to nail down that center
part of the electorate, those people who are ideologically in the
center?
   Bush: He helps me nationally by the same way he did it in
Indiana.
   Take a look at the record in terms of votes, take a look at the
standing in terms of voter acceptance today, the governor telling
me that Dan Quayle has a higher standing with the voters, Democrat
and Republican, than any other public figure in the state of
Indiana.
   That's how we do it.
   Right over here, Jerry and then Bob.
   Q. Mr. Vice President, there are some people who say you should
have done more to try to balance your ticket, either have someone
who's somewhat different from you, or who comes, who offers
something you don't, sir. Did you take that into consideration?
   Bush: He's different from me.
   I'm 64 and he's 41.
   And that's good, that's positive, because his message of hope
and opportunity, his record of job creation will resound and have
great emphasis in those particular, in the areas of younger people.
   And I've demonstrated, I've already said that he has
demonstrated his ability to get votes from women.
   So if we can convey nationally what he has demonstrated in one
state, it'll be of enormous help to this ticket.
   Bob. Yes.

   Barbara Bush, meeting with black and Hispanic
groups at the Republican National Convention, said Wednesday that
she's glad ``the doors of the Republican Party are wide open.''
   Praising the tone of ``inclusion'' set by keynote speaker Thomas
Kean, Mrs. Bush told the National Hispanic Assembly, ``I'm
enormously pleased that you have chosen to seek solutions in the
company of George Bush and the GOP.''
   Mrs. Bush visited a host of breakfasts hours before the roll
call vote that would give her husband the Republican presidential
nomination. She also visited a combined senior citizen and day care
center.
   In stops at breakfast meetings of black, Hispanic, Jewish and
elderly groups, she put in a plug for her campaign to improve
literacy in America.
   ``George is going to lead an education revival,'' she told the
``Black American Salute to Barbara Bush'' breakfast.
   ``George Bush will do everything he can to make a truly literate
America, where every American can read and write,'' she said.
``Now, we're counting on you to get this message out.''
   At a Hispanic breakfast, she was introduced by Florida Gov. Bob
Martinez, with one of Mrs. Bush's sons, Jeb, the state secretary of
commerce, standing by.
   She said she and her husband are interested in the problems of
Hispanic-Americans, and ``it's not just because we're linked by
blood.'' Jeb Bush's wife Columba is Mexican-American, and they have
three children.
   ``We share the same basic values, deep belief in family,'' Mrs.
Bush said. She also reiterated that her husband opposes any move
``to take the potentially divisive step of making English our
official language.''
   For that, she was given a loud ovation.
   ``Your political influence is only beginning to be felt,'' Mrs.
Bush said.
   Later, Mrs. Bush toured the Kingsley House in a poor section of
the city, a day-care facility that doubles as a place for the
elderly to congregate.
   Walking among tables covered with red and white plastic
tablecloths, she sat down next to a young man in a wheelchair. She
told Henry Neeley, 32, she had learned that he had come to the
center to be a social worker, but now was busy getting his Graduate
Equivalency Diploma.
   ``You're an inspiration to us all,'' she said.

<HEAD>Reagan to Bush to Quayle: The Mantle is Passed and Passed Again</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When George Bush took the fabled torch of
Republican leadership from Ronald Reagan, the first thing he did
was promise the next pass to 41-year-old Dan Quayle. The decision
to skip a generation leaves a number of party stalwarts with mixed
emotions and uncertain ambitions.
   Count Jack Kemp, Phil Gramm _ and who knows how many others _
among the wounded.
   The disappointment may have been sharpest among Kemp and the
other Republicans who had been considered by Bush for the vice
presidential nomination. Each of them knew that win or lose in
November, being on the Bush ticket would provide a leg up for the
next open presidential nomination.
   If Quayle acquits himself nicely between now and November, his
political clout, good looks and reliable conservative record would
make him a tough man to beat.
   Rep. Kemp had traipsed from state to state, from year to year,
to earn a shot at the leadership of his GOP generation. He ran
unsuccessfully against Bush and now, having failed to win the
mantle, he hoped to capture it the old-fashioned way _ by being
appointed to it.
   But Kemp lost his chance for the ticket when he failed to win a
single state and could not hope to deliver his own _ New York _ in
November. And so he could only wait forlornly by the phone on
Tuesday as Bush anointed Quayle the way Reagan had anointed Bush.
   In remarks that were warm, spontaneous and even included a
respectable Ronald Reagan impression, Kemp admitted Wednesday he
was disappointed when Bush telephoned him to give him the bad news.
   ``I'm not going to get emotional,'' Kemp said, clearing his
throat, ``but I was brought up by my parents to believe that all
things work together for good. I was brought up to believe that
momentary disappointments in our lives turn out, many times, to be
blessings in disguise.''
   ``Now I'll go back and play for the (Buffalo) Bills,'' his old
pro football team, Kemp joked. In fact, he'll soon be out of a job,
having given up his congressional seat to challenge Bush for the
nomination.
   It can't have been all that pleasant for Gramm, either.
   The feisty 46-year-old former Democrat is considered by many
conservatives to be ``next up'' for the Reagan mantle. He was
foreclosed from the Bush ticket because both men have a Texas voter
registration, and probably hoped that Bush would clear the decks
for the next GOP generation by choosing an older running mate _
someone fading from the scene, like former GOP Senate leader Howard
Baker, or Dole, who would be 69 in 1992 and an unlikely inheritor
of anyone's mantle or torch or anything.
   The Quayle activities overshadowed Gramm's nominating speech, a
highlight of Wednesday night's convention events, but it Gramm was
concerned, he wasn't saying so.
   Others watching the Quayle ascendency with a wary eye would
include:
   Presidential also-rans Pat Robertson and Pete du Pont; Sens.
John McCain of Arizona and Pete Domenici of New Mexico, and a
veritable plethora of governors and former governors: Richard
Thornburgh of Pennsylvania, Gov. Carroll Campbell of South
Carolina, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Gov. John Sununu of New
Hampshire, Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey, among others.
   Add some names from Reagan cabinets: Elizabeth Dole, William
Bennett and Donald Hodel.
   Bush bypassed them, one and all, and delivered Quayle from
anonymity.
   ``He's different from me,'' Bush said of Quayle. ``I'm 64 and
he's 41.''
   More to the point, Ronald Reagan is 77.
   Bush got off Air Force Two on Tuesday and said the significance
of his airport rendezvous with Reagan was that the mantle was being
passed _ he actually used the phrase. Before delegates had returned
from their late lunches, Bush had plunked Quayle from anonymity.
   ``Way to go, Danny!'' he exclaimed after Quayle had completed
his first speaking assignment. He called Quayle ``a man of the
future'' and handed Quayle the greatest political plum in the GOP.

   Jeff Bridges, who's been in more than two dozen
movies since 1971, says he could have done even more.
   ``Success opens up a lot of opportunities, sometimes too many,''
the 38-year-old star of ``Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' said in
the September issue of Esquire.
   ``I don't want to go as fast as I'm capable of going, so I have
these anchors I throw out from time to time to slow things down. I
don't need more opportunity. I have too much right now, too many
choices to make.''
   One choice is a career in music, which he was serious about long
before acting entered the picture. Bridges has written more than
100 songs and has a fully equipped log-cabin studio on his 900-acre
ranch in Montana.
   ``I just don't know whether it will ever go beyond the serious
hobby stage,'' he says.

   Kathleen DuRoss Ford, the widow of
Henry Ford II, is asking a judge to bar a new trustee of her
husband's $350 million estate from collecting a $1 million salary
she claims is extortionate.
   Attorneys asked Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Vaughn Rudnick
on Tuesday to temporarily enjoin William Donaldson, who owns an
investment firm, from acting as a trustee.
   ``It's an attempt to extort from the trust,'' said Greg
Barnhart, one of her attorneys. Donaldson ``wants a million dollars
a year for no work.''
   Donaldson has said he would become a trustee only if paid a $1
million annual salary. He said it was ``completely false'' that the
salary was unjustified. As a trustee, he said, it would be his duty
to help manage the estate, making decisions on investments and
expenditures.
   On Tuesday, the judge scheduled another hearing Sept. 26 and
barred any trustee meetings before that time.
   Ford, grandson of the founder of Ford Motor Co., died in
September 1987 at age 70. Before his death, he named as trustees of
the estate Mrs. Ford, who was his third wife; Edsel Ford II, his
son by a previous wife; and businessman and family friend Martin
Citrin. He named Donaldson as a successor if any of the other three
died, and Citrin died in April.

   Samuel E. Wright plays a seedy character on
television _ a bunch of grapes in the Fruit of the Loom underwear
ads. And at 39, he's also cast against type in his current
theatrical role.
   Wright is playing Midge Carter, an 82-year-old character, in
Herb Gardner's Tony Award-winning comedy, ``I'm Not Rappaport''
this week at the Corning Summer Theater.
   ``It gives me an escape from being a young adult,'' Wright said.
``I can say anything I please, I can do all these human things I
never get to do.''
   Wright originated the role of the grapes in the underwear
commercials 15 years ago, making it one of the longest-running ads
in TV.
   ``Mr. Whipple isn't squeezing Charmin anymore, but we're still
four grown men running around in foam suits,'' he said.
   While he prefers the more human roles he plays on the stage,
Wright said he has no plans to give up his juicy Fruit of the Loom
role.
   ``It's my bread and butter,'' he said.

   Country music singer Kathy Mattea says
she doesn't perform for critics or awards.
   ``You can't put all your self-worth in what the critics say,''
she said. ``It's not something I spend a lot of time thinking
about.''
   Miss Mattea, 29, has been nominated for a Grammy, but she hasn't
won. She also has yet to win a Country Music Association award,
though she's a contender this year.
   What Miss Mattea has done is churn out hits, including ``18
Wheels and a Dozen Roses.''
   ``I don't do it for the glamour,'' said the Cross Lanes, W.Va.,
native who moved to Nashville 10 years ago. ``It's not all that
glamorous. ... I don't do it for the reviews or the awards.''
   Miss Mattea and her band recently returned from a European tour
and performed last week at the Greene County Fair.
   ``Music wasn't really something I sat down and decided to do
when I was young,'' she said the day of her Greeneville show.
``Everything that led to my career as a singer just happened. ... I
just sort of drifted into all of this.''

   Q. Mr. Vice President, most polls have suggested that Senator
Dole would have been a stronger ticket. Why did you choose Senator
Quayle rather than Senator Dole?
   Bush: It was a tough call.
   There were several men and women who would fit the criteria that
I spelled out ahead of time.
   But I felt for the reasons I've given here that Dan Quayle is
the best choice.
   Way back here.
   Q. Senator Quayle, during the Iran-Contra hearings last summer,
there was testimony that your office served as a meeting place for
people like John Hull and Rob Owen, who were involved in Contra
resupply during the Boland amendment. Were you involved in this
Contra fund-raising and resupply operation and did you have any
contact with Vice President Bush or his office about it?
   Quayle: None, and the question is off base as far as any of
those meetings going on.
   Q. Senator Quayle, since this is a family values campaign, I'm
sure you're eager to clear up questions about your relationship
with Paula Parkinson, the former lobbyist and Playboy model. I have
a two-part question. The first part is: You have said that you went
on a weekend with two congressmen, one of whom brought her along,
that you saw her only once, and you played golf the rest of the
time. First of all, sir, is that an accurate account?
   Quayle: No.
   Q. OK. Could you give us an accurate account?
   Quayle: That has been covered and there's nothing to it.
   Q. Well, the second part of the question, then, is: Have you
seen her on any other occasion in Washington, perhaps, other than
that Florida trip?
   QUAYLE: No.
   Q. Thank you.

   George Bush today called his new running
mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, ``one of the rising stars in the Republican
Party'' and said the youthful conservative is qualified to be ``one
heartbeat away from the presidency.''
   Bush said the 41-year-old Indiana senator would help the GOP
ticket in every region of America. ``We're going to tell the truth
and it's going to seem like they've (the Democrats) engaged a
couple of pit bulls,'' Bush said.
   ``We agree on the fundamental challenges that face this
country,'' the vice president said, standing alongside his running
mate at a news conference just hours before the Republican National
Convention was to deliver Bush its 1988 presidential nomination.
   From his mountaintop ranch in California, the vacationing
President Reagan telephoned Quayle with congratulations Tuesday
night. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said a joint
Reagan-Bush appearance is being considered for next Wednesday in
Los Angeles.
   Bush and Quayle will make their first campaign appearance on the
road Friday at a courthouse rally in Quayle's hometown of
Huntington, Ind., 25 miles southwest of Fort Wayne.
   Traveling together around this convention city, Bush and Quayle
appeared at a news conference and at a rousing rally given by the
California delegation. Hoping to capture the state's huge cache of
47 electoral votes, Bush said, ``California is essential. We will
not overlook it. We will concentrate on it.''
   California Gov. George Deukmejian, who earlier said that Quayle
would neither help nor hurt in California, praised the choice of
the Hoosier senator ``bold and imaginative.''
   The first question at the news conference was whether Quayle was
qualified to step in as president should anything happen to Bush.
The vice president said, ``I've listened to his peers ... who speak
eloquently of Dan Quayle's standing to be one heartbeat away from
the presidency.''
   Describing his qualifications, Quayle said he had spent a dozen
years in Congress, had experience in Indiana state government and
``had met a payroll'' at his family newspaper in Indiana. Quayle
has been in Congress since he was 29 years old.
   Quayle was asked about whether he had been involved with Paula
Parkinson, the key figure in a sex-and-influence scandal in 1980.
Quayle and two other members of Congress spent a weekend with
Parkinson in a Florida condominium.
   ``That has been covered and there's nothing to it,'' Quayle
said. Asked if he had seen Parkinson on any other occasion, he
said, ``No.''
   Quayle said he considered it to be ``a cheap shot'' to suggest
that he ducked service in Vietnam by enlisting in the National
Guard.
   ``I have a deep affection for those men and women who sacrificed
their lives in Vietnam and for anybody to imply anything
differently is just simply wrong,'' he said.
   He said it was not a handicap that he had not served in Vietnam.
   Earlier in the day Bush practiced his acceptance speech at the
podium of the Louisiana Superdome convention hall where his
nomination will be secured late tonight.
   ``We'll do all right, I'll do OK,'' he said of his acceptance
speech, set for Thursday night.
   Quayle, an heir to the Pulliam newspaper publishing empire, was
asked about reports that his wealth exceeded $200 million.
   ``That figure is not correct,'' Quayle said. ``Believe me, you
have caused me a lot of problems at home because my wife is asking
about that.'' He promised that a full financial statement would be
forthcoming.
   Bush, asked if the addition of Quayle underscored the image of
Republicans as the party of the rich, said, ``I picked the best
man. ... It's not a question of personal wealth.''
   Bush was asked if it was smart politics to choose a running mate
so much like himself. ``He's different from me,'' Bush said. ``I'm
64 and he is 41.''
   Bush said that making his choice was ``a tough call. There were
several men and women who fit the criteria. I felt Dan Quayle was
the best choice,'' adding that ``he helps me nationally.''
   ``I didn't think I had to do something bold or different,'' the
vice president added.
   Bush bridled when a reporter asked him what he had meant Tuesday
when he introduced his three Mexican-American grandchildren to
President Reagan as ``the little brown ones.''
   ``Those grandchildren are my pride and joy,'' the vice president
said. ``I find it personally offensive'' to suggest otherwise.
``And p.s. _ I don't want to see these kids hurt. This is family
and I'm going to protect them.''
   Bush opened his news conference by expressing ``how horrible I
feel'' about the deaths today of President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq and
U.S. Ambassador Arnold L. Raphel. They were killed today when their
Pakistani military plane exploded in the eastern part of that
country.
   Turning back to politics, Bush said he and Quayle would be a
formidable challenge to the Democratic team of Michael Dukakis and
Lloyd Bentsen.
   Describing Quayle as ``one of the rising stars in the Republican
Party,'' Bush said he picked the Indiana senator for several
reasons. ``Most importantly, he's qualified,'' Bush said.
   Moroever, he said, ``We agree on the fundamental challenges that
face this country: how to keep America strong and secure, how to
create opportunities for American families. While a Midwesterner, I
believe he will help our cause in every part of the country.''
   The news conference provided Bush with an opportunity to tweak
the Dukakis-Bentsen team about the differences on policy issues.
   ``We aren't going off in two different directions like the
Demcoratic ticket. ... We won't have to debate each other,'' the
vice president said.
   On the other hand, Paul Brountas, campaign chairman for
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, said Quayle was
``relatively inexperienced.'' He suggested Bush ``seemed to make a
decision that placated the right wing of the Republican Party.''
   Many delegates admitted that they didn't know much about Bush's
choice, but seemed enthusiastic anyway about the selection of the
two-term junior senator from Indiana.
   ``Super, super choice,'' said John Lindley III, chairman of the
Vermont delegation. ``A real spark plug for Bush,'' said North
Dakota GOP chairman Layton Freborg. ``We need the female vote.
He'll do the trick,'' added Sharon Estrada of Montana. ``He's very
cute.''

   Could Tony Bennett leave his heart in
Frisco Bay?
   That's the question being asked around town ever since the idea
of renaming this small mountain community was floated at a town
meeting earlier this month.
   Never mind that there are no little cable cars, though there are
plenty of cable-pulled chair lifts for winter skiers.
   There's no San Francisco Bay, either _ but there is Lake Dillon.
   Robert Philippe, a real estate agent and vice chairman of a
commission formed to develop the lake area, is the proponent of the
name change. Only 200 of the town's 1,7000 residents need to sign a
petition, he said at the meeting, to put the name change on the
ballot.
   ``We think the name Frisco Bay is more descriptive of exactly
what the town is,'' said Philippe.
   Frisco Bay proponents have delayed a petition drive until after
a vote on a home-rule proposition that would help with financing
such lakeside improvements as a marina and golf course.
   Not everyone is captivated.
   Karen Mack, manager of the Frisco Historical Park, said the name
change strays from the town's heritage as an early Colorado mining
camp.
   It isn't clear how the town got its name, although one story is
told in which a sign reading ``Frisco House'' _ the name of a
notorious bordello in nearby Leadville _ was nailed to one of the
first cabins in town, and the name stuck.

   Take The Chief, for instance. The Berkshire pig tops the scales
at 1,110 pounds. The Indiana State Fair calls him the world's
largest hog.
   The champ's owner, Bob M. Corbett of North Lewisburg, Ohio,
collected $250 for the title and $100 because the champion was over
1,000 pounds. He also received a plaque.
   The reserve champion weighed only five pounds less. Monica and

   The room was a politician's dream.
   Red, white and blue banners hung from the ceiling. An orchestra,
a jazz band and a chorus of political and religious leaders lined
the stage, and more than 6,000 potential voters sat in the audience.
   Backstage, Mayor Sidney Barthelemy was asked to deliver the
pledge of allegiance and kick off a two-hour ecumenical breakfast
honoring the Republican National Convention and arranged by his
wife, Mickey.
   ``Nah,'' said the mayor, almost mumbling. ``My wife is the star
of the program.''
   As his city basks in media attention, scores of interviewers
have forced the often bashful Barthelemy to share the spotlight.
   ``I don't seek it. It just happens,'' Barthelemy said.
   It began before dawn Tuesday.
   His face dabbed with make-up, the mayor sat in the ``Today''
show trailer, nibbling grapes and watching television. He did not
introduce himself to the two political analysts sitting beside him
on the couch.
   When his turn came to be interviewed _ for the hundredth time
this week, he sighed _ Jane Pauley asked the two routine questions:
Why is a Democratic city hosting the Republican National
Convention, and what's the economic impact?
   The mayor gave his routine answers: The Republicans were smart
enough to choose New Orleans, and the economy needs help but the
city is on its way.
   Then Pauley threw in a surprise: Former Arizona Sen. Barry
Goldwater, who forgot his credentials and had trouble getting onto
the Superdome floor Monday, called this convention the worst he'd
ever seen. Did the mayor have any comment?
   ``The Republicans run inside the Dome and we run outside, and
that's where we're doing a great job,'' Barthelemy said, bringing
warm applause from the audience.
   ``They clapped,'' the mayor said as he walked off the set. He
seemed surprised. ``They almost made me lose my concentration.''

   Ben and Jerry, who make ice cream in Vermont for
fun as well as profit, came to New York on Wednesday to push peace.
   The medium of their message was, of course, ice cream _ a
four-ounce, chocolate-covered bar on a stick that they are
marketing as Ben & Jerry's Peace Pop.
   ``The purpose of the pop is to promote peace,'' Ben Cohen said
at a news conference in Ralph Bunche Park, across the street from
the United Nations.
   The partners said they will give 1 percent of the profits from
the pops and the rest of their business to their recently formed
organization, 1 Percent for Peace.
   That will amount to about $50,000 a year, said Jerry Greenfield,
the numbers expert in the partnership.
   He said the company will crank out 12{ million Peace Pops a year
in four flavors, with a retail price of about $1.75.
   The pop is packed with a message appealing to customers to join
1 Percent for Peace in its effort to persuade Congress to mandate
that 1 percent of the military budget, or about $3 billion, be
channeled into projects for peace.
   Cohen said other businesses that have agreed to contribute 1
percent of their pretax profits to the peace include Natural
Nectars, a California food company, Double Rainbow Ice Cream of San
Francisco, Stonyfield Yogurt of New Hampshire and Smith & Hawkin, a
California gardening supplier.
   Possible uses of the money include educational exchange
programs, joint U.S.-Soviet projects in third world countries, a
multinational youth corps and support for local forums in which
ordinary citizens could decide to back programs they believe will
advance peace.
   Cohen and Greenfield, both 37 and friends since seventh grade,
live in Jericho and Williston, Vt., respectively and make their
critically acclaimed ice cream in Waterbury, Vt.

   The battle to keep the city of Yonkers out of
possible bankruptcy and defiant city councilmen out of jail moved
Wednesday to a federal appeals court.
   The City Council again rejected a federal court-ordered housing
desegregation plan early Tuesday, despite potentially bankrupting
fines issued after it voted the same way two weeks ago.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals began hearing arguments
Wednesday afternoon by lawyers for the city and four recalcitrant
councilmen seeking to overturn the contempt of court citation
issued two weeks ago by U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand.
   On Aug. 1, the Council voted 4-3 against a resolution endorsing
a subsidized housing plan to integrate the state's fourth-largest
city. The plan was in accordance with a federal court order for 200
units of low-income housing and 800 units of moderate-income
housing throughout Yonkers.
   Sand then held the city and the four council members who voted
against the plan in contempt, threatening the four with jail. He
also issued heavy fines against the city.
   The escalating fines against the city began at $100 and doubled
daily with a potential total of $337 million _ the amount of the
city's entire annual budget _ within 22 days. The city's fines had
accumulated to $25,600 when a three-judge panel of the federal
appeals court ordered them temporarily halted last week pending the
appeal of the contempt order.
   Sand also ordered the council to meet once a week to cast
another vote on the housing plan. This week's meeting was the first.
   Sand's contempt ruling was the most serious step in his
continuing battle impose a plan to build hundreds of subsidized
apartments in Yonkers' predominantly white neighborhoods. That plan
stemmed from Sand's 1985 landmark ruling that Yonkers had
deliberately segregated housing and schools for four decades.

   Q. Senator Quayle, Vice President Bush has made financial
disclosure a hallmark of his career and also talked about it in
this campaign. Are you prepared to pledge today full financial
disclosure, all your holdings, your trusts, at the outset of this
campaign?
   Quayle: Yes. And that will be done in a reasonable period of
time.
   Bush: And we will be challenging the Democrats: 10 years of tax
returns, starting this year, going back 10. Lay it out on the
record, fully. I believe in full disclosure and so did he.
   Gabe?
   Q. Mr. Vice President, the Democrats, including Mr. Dukakis,
claim that there are big holes in the Reagan safety net, with
millions of people in the large urban centers of this country,
including New York, facing poverty and homelessness. Many of these
are children. What, in an immediate sense, can conservative
ideology do for them?
   Bush: We passed the McKinney bill.
   It should be fully funded.
   We should all work at all levels of government, not just
federal, but state and local, to provide housing.
   I've made some specific proposals that relate to defense
establishments.
   There's a provision in the law where some of those can be used
for housing.
   The fundamental answer, of course, is to do better, in terms of
housing itself, and that gets into the fundamental economic
questions.
   But it is a key issue.
   It's one that the senator and I feel strongly about.
   And we're going to keep on trying.

<HEAD>Thousands Protest For End To One-Party Rule In Burma</HEAD>

   Thousands of anti-government protesters
again took to the streets of Burma's two largest cities Wednesday,
demanding an end to 26 years of one-party rule and rigid socialism,
diplomats and media reports said.
   Student leaders in Rangoon made speeches before about 5,000
protesters who rallied outside Rangoon General Hospital. It was the
largest demonstration in the capital since last week's bloody riots
toppled hard-line President Sein Lwin, diplomats in Rangoon said.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service, in a dispatch from Rangoon, said
there were reports of an orderly demonstration involving nearly
10,000 people in Mandalay, Burma's second-largest city. The report
could not be independently confirmed.
   Also, the daughter of late Burmese independence leader Aung San
issued a statement calling for a caretaker government that would
lead to a multiparty system Burma has not had since 1962, according
to a Rangoon-based Western diplomat.
   The daughter, Aung San Suu Kyi, lives in Cambridge, England, but
is visiting her mother in Rangoon, the diplomat said. Burmese
marchers have carried pictures of her father, who was assassinated
a year before Burma achieved independence from Britain in 1948.
   In Washington, a U.S. State Department official said tension was
rising in Burma before emergency political meetings scheduled
Friday that may select new leaders to replace Sein Lwin.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said security
forces did not try to interfere with Wednesday's Rangoon rally.
During last week's disturbances, security forces repeatedly fired
on protesters who refused to disperse.
   State-run Radio Rangoon says at least 95 people were killed and
240 wounded last week in the largest demonstrations since 1948.
Western diplomats say they believe hundreds were killed but say
they have no evidence.
   The crowd in Rangoon, which included several Buddhist monks,
also held a Buddhist ceremony in front of the hospital to mourn
those killed by security forces.
   Sein Lwin resigned as state president and party chairman after
only 17 days in power. He had succeeded Ne Win, whose 1962 military
coup ended democracy in Burma and instituted one-party rule.
   A senior Western diplomat said Wednesday a military coup was
possible if army commanders believe leadership changes do not meet
popular calls for reform. He reported rumors of dissension within
the military, which may not support the government if street
protests resume.
   During last week's rioting, security forces in at least two
towns were reported to have sided with demonstrators.
   The Rangoon Lawyers' Council on Tuesday lodged an unprecedented
formal protest with the government over the security forces' firing
on peaceful protesters.
   The letter demanded multiparty rule, lifting of the state of
emergency in Rangoon and other cities, release of detainees, a halt
to use of force by security personnel, an independent investigation
into the shootings, and disclosure of information on casualties.
   A copy of the text was received Wednesday by a foreign embassy.
   ``It's considered significant in that many prominent people have
signed it,'' a diplomat said.
   State-owned Radio Rangoon meanwhile said 52 more people arrested
in last week's riots were released Wednesday. The radio said 51
were freed Tuesday in Rangoon while 30 people were released Sunday
in Pegu, 45 miles northeast of Rangoon.
   Several prominent figures arrested July 29-30 still are being
held. They include the country's leading dissident, Aung Gyi, and
Sein Win, the Burmese correspondent of The Associated Press.
   In Washington, the State Department said U.S. military training
will continue for Burmese officials because it does not believe the
trainees were responsible for last week's shootings. The $260,000
program is the only U.S. aid granted to the isolated Asian country.

<HEAD>Housing Starts Up for 2nd Month, But Rebound May Be Brief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction rose a moderate 2.4
percent in July, the government reported Wednesday, but economists
warned that rising mortgage rates could make the two-month housing
rebound a brief one.
   The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were being
built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.49 million units
last month after advancing 4.4 percent in June.
   Housing starts had dropped a sharp 12.1 percent in May to the
slowest pace in three years, and rising mortgage rates were blamed.
   The June-July rebound was attributed to stabilized mortgage
rates, but last week the Federal Reserve boosted the discount rate,
the interest it charges for loans to member banks.
   This move was widely interpreted as the opening salvo in a
renewed battle by the central bank to drive up interest rates to
fight inflation. As a consequence, a variety of other interest
rates, including the banks' prime lending rate and mortgage rates
have moved higher.
   Fixed-rate mortgages rose to 10.57 percent by the end of last
week and analysts predicted mortgages would soon top 11 percent.
   ``I believe we have seen the peak for housing starts this year
as rising interest rates cut into sales,'' said Richard Peach, an
economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of
Home Builders, said his organization was so concerned by the Fed's
credit-tightening moves that he asked Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan in a letter for ``a more even-handed approach.''
   ``Clearly, the Fed views the housing industry and other interest
rate-sensitive sectors of the economy as being sacrificial lambs,''
Seiders said.
   Sales of homes and other high-priced items usually are the first
to fall off when the Federal Reserve tries to dampen borrowing by
raising interest rates.
   Michael Sumichrast, an economist and publisher of a construction
industry newsletter, said that if mortgage rates climb to 11.5
percent or higher, it would spell disaster for the housing industry.
   He said home sales already have been hurt by big price increases
in many parts of the country.
   ``I don't think you can sell houses at 11.5 percent to 12
percent mortgage rates in this market because of the price
increases,'' Sumichrast said.
   Analysts say another worrisome sign is that housing permits,
considered a good barometer of future activity, fell in July by 5.4
percent to an annual rate of 1.41 million units. It was the biggest
permit decline since January.
   James Christian, chief economist of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, said the drop in housing permits probably reflects
builders' fears of rising mortgage rates.
   He said the impact of higher rates should be moderated by a
consumer shift toward adjustable rate mortgages, which carry a
lower initial rate.
   The July increase stemmed from a big jump in starts of
multi-family construction, which offset a small decline in
single-family units.
   Single-family homes were being built at an annual rate of 1.08
million units last month, down 0.8 percent from the June level.
   Construction of multi-family units shot up 12.1 percent to an
annual rate of 409,000 units following a 6.2 percent decline in
June.
   The multi-family sector has been depressed for nearly two years
because of the adverse effects of the 1986 tax law on real estate
investment, but some analysts said the steep decline in apartment
construction finally may have bottomed out.
   By region, housing starts were strongest in the Middle West,
climbing by 12.1 percent to an annual rate of 296,000 units.
Construction rose 9.2 percent in the Northeast to an annual rate of
262,000 units.
   Construction fell 3.2 percent in the West to an annual rate of
368,000 units, and it slumped 1.2 percent in the South to a rate of
563,000 units.
   For the first seven months of 1988, housing starts have been
running 10.6 percent below the level of the same period in 1987.

   President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq and
U.S. Ambassador Arnold L. Raphel were killed today when their
Pakistani military plane exploded in the eastern part of the
country.
   The crash apparently also killed U.S. Brig. Gen. Herbert M.
Wassom, Pentagon sources said on condition of anonymity. Wassom was
the chief defense representative to Pakistan and would have been
traveling routinely with Raphel.
   There was no official comment on the cause of the explosion, but
speculation focused on a possible explosion on board, a missile
attack or a collision with another aircraft.
   The Pakistan air force C-130 transport plane with 37 people
aboard had just taken off from Bahawalpur, 330 miles south of
Islamabad, when it exploded about 4:30 p.m. (7:30 a.m. EDT),
official radio said. A government statement read over the radio
said no one aboard the plane survived.
   Besides Raphel, Wassom and Zia, who was also army chief of
staff, the passengers included several senior Pakistani army
generals, the radio said.
   Conflicting unofficial reports said the aircraft may have been
struck by an anti-aircraft missile. Another version said it
collided with a helicopter. Neither Pakistani nor U.S. diplomats
could confirm either report.
   Another rumor circulating Islamabad said the plane may have been
shot down by India. Bahawalpur is 80 miles west of the border.
Pakistani officials refused to comment except to say an
investigation was under way.
   Pakistan became independent from Britain and separate from India
in 1947. In 1971, East Pakistan became the nation of Bangladesh
after a civil war.
   India and Pakistan each station tens of thousands of troops
alongside their 1,836-mile border, the site of three wars in the
past 41 years. A U.N. observer force has manned the border in the
disputed Kashmir-Jammu region since 1949.
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said in New Delhi he was
``deeply shocked and distressed'' about Zia's death and sent
condolences to his family.
   An earlier incorrect report said the plane crashed near the city
of Lahore.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
Zia and Raphel went to the remote area in southwestern Pakistan to
view a field demonstration of the U.S.-made M-1 tank Pakistan was
thinking of buying.
   No other details on the crash were immediately available.
   Ghulam Ishaq Khan, chairman of the Pakistani Senate, immediately
took over as caretaker president under the Pakistani Constitution,
officials said. Khan, the Cabinet and three armed forces chiefs
were meeting to discuss the situation, a government statement said.
   The senate chairman planned to address the nation later in the
evening. The government announced 10 days of official mourning.
   It was not immediately clear what effect Zia's death would have
on general elections scheduled for Nov. 16.
   Gen. Zia, 64, took power in a 1977 military coup and ruled with
an iron hand under martial law until December 1985. He began
sharing power with a civilian government in early 1986 but fired
the government again on May 29, saying it failed to maintain law
and order and to enact Islamic law.
   The career military officer and U.S. ally strongly supported
Afghan guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed Marxist government of
Afghanistan and kept up his nation's military strength to guard
borders with India. Recently, the Soviet Union warned Pakistan to
stop allowing arms intended for the Afghan guerrillas to pass
through Pakistani territory.
   Zia took power from Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1977,
arrested the Cabinet and proclaimed martial law. Two years later,
he ordered his predecessor executed on charges of conspiracy to
murder. Under his authoritarian rule, mass arrests and floggings
were frequent.
   His rule was helped by geopolitics and luck: the Soviet
intervention in Afghanistan in 1979 led to more Western aid, and
good harvests brought more food in the early 1980s.
   In recent months, however, he faced an unprecedented challenge
by the country's increasingly unified political opposition, led by
Benazir Bhutto, the daughter of the former prime minister.
   Ms. Bhutto, leader of the opposition Pakistan People's Party,
said from her Karachi home she was satisfied that constitutional
powers were being followed.
   ``Whatever should have been done has been done. We are sure the
changeover will be as smooth as possible,'' Ms. Bhutto said. ``Life
and death is in the hand of God. We will not say anything,'' she
said.
   Elsewhere in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city with a population
of 9 million, life appeared normal but people were buzzing about
Zia's death.
   There were no immediate reports of unusual military activity in
Pakistan after the president's death was announced.
   Raphel, 45, and a native of Troy, N.Y., was named ambassador to
the Southeast Asian country in January 1987 by President Reagan.
   It was his second assignment to the country. He served there
from 1975 to 1978 as political officer in the U.S. Embassy. Raphel
played a key role in negotiations to end the U.S. hostage crisis in
Iran in 1981.
   Vice President George Bush said at a news conference in New
Orleans, the site of the Republican Party convention, that Pakistan
and the United States ``have a very special relationship and the
loss of Gen. Zia is a great tragedy.''
   He called Raphel ``an outstanding ambassador. I knew him well.''
   Secretary of State George Shultz said in New Orleans that Zia
``has been a great friend and a great fighter for freedom,'' as
well as a ``supporter of the efforts that finally brought the
departure of the Soviets out of Afghanistan.''
   Shultz added, ``We in the U.S. have had a long, friendly, strong
relationship with that country that will continue in that way.''
   Jeane Kirkpatrick, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
said Zia's death raises doubts about Pakistan's ability to support
the Afghan rebels. Kirkpatrick, interviewed on television from the
Republican convention, said she was ``shocked'' by the news of
Zia's death.
   ``Zia was a very strong person,'' she said. He was ``very
important to the whole geopolitical strategic constellation of the
region, very important to the freedom fighters of Afghanistan.''

   Q. Senator Quayle, you have backed Senator Domenici's budget
proposal that calls for $22 billion in tax increases. Are you going
to be at odds with the platform of the Republicans that calls for
no tax increases?
   Quayle: Absolutely not, because, let's face it, we have economic
growth today because of the Reagan-Bush tax cuts.
   And the vice president has pledged, and I support him in that
pledge, that we are simply not going to raise taxes.
   It would be foolhardy.
   Why would we want to raise taxes and try to send this economy
into a downturn?
   We have gotten economic growth through tax cuts.
   Q. Why did you support a budget that called for a tax increase
in fiscal year '83 of $22 billion?
   Quayle: That was the budget, the Domenici budget, it was a
compromise worked out, and in the legislative process you have
compromise. But we're _ there is no compromise on raising taxes.
   Q. (Start of question inaudible) _ Senator Quayle, that you are
going to lead the charge against the Democrats and, words like pit
bull have been used, and so forth. Without using those words, is
that true? Are you going to be leading the charge against the
Democrats?
   Quayle: Well, that's a new description. I am going to be working
with the vice president, and campaigning and articulating a very
positive agenda of the future, of family and preserving our
freedoms, and preserving our hope and opportunity.
   Now obviously I intend to point out what would happen if the
party of McGovern, Carter, Mondale and Dukakis would somehow get
back in power.
   I think it would be a disaster.

   Bush: Let me add, since he addressed it to both of us, we're
going to tell the truth and it's going to seem like they're engaged
to a couple of pit bulls.
   Because that's the way it's going to be.
   We're going to talk about these issues, each in our own way, and
we've had a convention, and will, I think, when it finishes, that
have one where talk has been much more specific than the other side.
   And we will be telling the truth about where we want to lead
this country, spelling out my priorities and Dan speaking to the

   Competence is important.
   But ideology is very important.
   And we're going to be talking on both.
   Yes, two here on the front.
   Q. Mr. Vice President, would you tell us a little bit about how
you first met Dan Quayle and how well you've known him since then?
   Bush: I've known him for many years.
   I campaigned for Senator Quayle back in the '70s.
   Quayle: 1978.
   Bush: I campaigned again with him when he ran for re-election.
   And so I've known him favorably, and most recently he has been
one of our key advisers, before this selection process even began,
on national security.

   Three families who have lived a rent-free
rural life for years are being forced to move by their landlord,
the Smithsonian Institution.
   ``I don't know why they want us to move. I feel very bad and
shocked,'' said Edith Tongue, who has lived in her small house for
about 15 years.
   Mrs. Tongue, 47, and her 20-year-old son are one of five
low-income families living on 2,600 acres of nature preserve the
Smithsonian owns on the Rhode River in Edgewater and Harwood.
   At least one house does not meet county health regulations
because it lacks a water and septic system. Other houses need
extensive repairs.
   The Smithsonian decided this year to get out of the ``landlord
business,'' spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs said Tuesday. ``We do not
want people to live on our property. We're just not able to serve
as a landlord.''
   The agency has asked Mrs. Tongue and two other families to move
by August 1989. It is reviewing the status of another family. One
elderly woman with a legal claim to tenancy will be permitted to
stay. A sixth tenant moved in June, and his house has been
demolished.
   Most of the families moved to the property decades ago. The
owners sold the land to the Smithsonian during the past 20 years,
but the tenants remained.
   Anne Arundel County officials say they will make public housing
or rental subsidies available to the tenants by next August, Ms.
Jacobs said. The Smithsonian will evict those who refuse
alternative housing, she said.
   Rebecca Smith, 73, of Edgewater, said she did not know where she
would go.
   The retired maid plans to apply for public housing assistance,
although she would rather not live in a housing project.
   She does not blame the Smithsonian, however.
   ``It belongs to them. There's nothing I can do. There's nothing
I can be angry about,'' she said.

<HEAD>President Says Jailed Black Leader Getting Best Hospital Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha said
Wednesday that jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, reportedly
suffering from tuberculosis, is getting the best possible care in a
hospital and wished him a speedy recovery.
   Botha, in his first public comment on Mandela's illness, said
the 70-year-old African National Congress leader was ``in a special
category of his own'' and was receiving individualized attention
exceeding ``the normal high standards of medical care provided by
the prisons and health authorities.''
   The president's remarks were made in a letter to the Rev. Frank
Chikane, a prominent black activist who had expressed concern about
Mandela's care.
   ``We are even more concerned and do wish Mr. Mandela a speedy
recovery,'' Botha said in his letter. The text was released by the
president's office.
   Mandela, who has been jailed since 1962, is serving a life
sentence for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the white-ruled
government. He was transferred Friday to Tygerberg Hospital in Cape
Town from nearby Pollsmoor Prison.
   His lawyer, Ismail Ayob, announced Wednesday that doctors
diagnosed Mandela's illness as tuberculosis. Hospital authorities
have refused to confirm or deny this and said Mandela asked them to
withhold comment.
   Tygerberg's superintendent, Dr. J.G.L. Strauss, said Wednesday
that Mandela had a ``good prognosis'' for complete recovery.
   Mandela was ``up and about'' and responding well to treatment,
Strauss said, adding that Mandela was satisfied with his treatment.
   Chikane, on behalf of the Mandela family, had urged authorities
to allow an independent medical team to examine Mandela. Hospital
officials said Mandela turned down such an offer.
   Botha said Mandela ``is being treated by doctors that are
internationally recognized as experts in their fields.''
   ``I am therefore of the opinion that the medical team presently
in charge of the treatment and Mr. Mandela be allowed jointly to
decide on whether other medical assistance should be called in,''
Botha said.
   The illness renewed speculation that the government might
consider releasing Mandela. The government has given no indication
of any change in its stance.
   The African National Congress is the major guerrilla
organization fighting the government and its apartheid system of
racial segregation.
   Botha suggested in 1986 that Mandela, whom many blacks consider
their paramount leader, could be released if he renounced violence.
Mandela said he would do so only if the guerrilla movement was
unbanned and apartheid was dismantled.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee, who oversees the prison system,
said Tuesday he was ``deeply perturbed'' by the reports of
Mandela's ill health.
   ``The entire issue, as well as steps to ensure a speedy
recovery, are receiving my personal attention,'' Coetsee said.
   Doctors say Mandela is in satisfactory condition after removal
of a drainage tube from his inflamed left lung. Strauss said
Mandela has been ``steadily improving since his admission.''
   But Ayob said Mandela was bedridden for most of the past two
weeks.
   ``His condition has been deteriorating for some time,'' Ayob
said. ``He was short of breath, he had a persistent cough, his
speech had been impaired and by last Friday he had lost his voice
completely.
   ``He looked very thin and suddenly looked very much older,''
Ayob said.

   Q. Senator Quayle, listening to the Democrats trying to knock
you down very quickly _ and this morning they were attacking you as
someone who says he's tough on defense _ but from your era, you
didn't fight in the Vietnam War. I'm wondering if you think that
that's a low blow from them, or if you'd like to respond to them,
going on the attack on you on that matter?
   Quayle: Yes, I do perceive that as being a cheap shot.
   I have a deep affection for those men and women that sacrificed
their lives in Vietnam.
   And anybody, to imply anything differently is just simply wrong.
   Q. But my point is Mr. Bush was a war hero in World War II,
you're tough on defense _ do you think it's going to be a handicap
in the campaign that you didn't fight in Vietnam?
   Quayle: No, I do not.
   Q. Mr. Vice President, some of your staff have been at pains to
point out what a bold stroke your choice of Senator Quayle was. How
important was it for you to show that you're your own man, a
risk-taker, willing to take a bold stroke?
   Bush: Well, I don't think it's a great risk, because I think
that when the country sees what I have already seen, and when the
country understands why these senators with whom this man works are
so high on him, that they will see it as a very natural choice.
   So I don't think, as I went through the decision-making process,
I wasn't, I wasn't compelled to say I've got to do something bold
or something different.
   I went through a serious process.
   I hope I did it in a dignified way.
   I think we had control of the situation and as I, the more I
thought about it, the more I thought this was the best possible
choice I could make.
   Right here, yes, sir.

<DATELINE>WUNSIEDEL, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jackbooted demonstrators carrying
swastika banners were arrested Wednesday near the burial site of
Rudolf Hess on the first anniversary of his death.
   The group of 14 Italians and an Irishman rallied briefly, but
they were taken into custody before nearing the cemetery, police
said. Such protests are banned during the week of the anniversary.
   Hess hanged himself at the age of 93 in Berlin's Spandau Prison
on Aug. 17, 1987.
   Police had encircled the cemetery to keep away the 500 to 1,000
right-wing extremists they had expected. The former deputy fuhrer's
son and daughter-in-law, Wolf-Ruediger and Andrea Hess, were
allowed to visit the grave.
   ``Everything was quiet at the cemetery,'' said Wunsiedel police
spokesman Roland Weber. ``It's all closed off.''
   Weber said the 15 protesters were apprehended for violating the
protest ban, which extends from midnight Tuesday to midnight
Sunday. They were wearing bomber jackets and ``carrying two banners
with swastika-like emblems'' as well as displaying other neo-Nazi
symbols, he said.
   Three West German ``Skinheads'' were also picked up but were set
free because ``they had nothing to do'' with the rally, Weber said.
   Within days of Hess' death last year, police in Wunsiedel
arrested more than 100 right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis who
converged on the town. Many were wearing neo-Nazi emblems and
shouting neo-Nazi slogans.
   Hess, who was deputy to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, was the sole
prisoner in Spandau, which was administered by France, Britain, the
United States and the Soviet Union, the Allies of World War II.

   President Reagan said he was
``deeply saddened'' Wednesday by the deaths in a plane crash of
Pakistani President Zia ul-Haq and two high-ranking Americans, but
his aides said the White House had no information on what caused
the C-130 aircraft to go down near Lahore.
   ``In these seven and a half years, I met with President Zia
several times and we worked together for peace and stability,''
Reagan said in a statement issued as he began a thre-week
California vacation at his ranch north of here.
   ``The United States was fortunate to have such a friend in
President Zia but our support for Pakistan is not dependent upon
any individual,'' the president said. ``We will give our full
support to acting President Ghulam Ishan Khan.''
   ``I am deeply saddened to learn of the deaths of President Zia
... and the American ambassador to Pakistan, Arnold Raphel, and
others in the crash of President Zia's C-130,'' the president said.
   ``Ambassador Raphel was a distinguished officer of the Foreign
Service. He worked tirelesslsy to build and preserve the ties
between our two countries.''
   The president's statement was written before it was reported at
the Pentagaon that the crash apparently also took the life of Brig.
Gen. Herbert M. Wassom, the chief U.S. defense representative in
Pakistan.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president's
national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, was informed
of the crash by U.S. military authorities early Wednesday and
telephoned Reagan at the ranch at 7:47 a.m. (PDT).
   Fitzwater said Powell then telephoned Vice President George Bush
and White House Chief of Staff Kenneth M. Duberstein in New
Orleans, where they are attending the Republican National
Convention. ``We don't have any information on the cause of the
crash at this point,'' the presidential spokesman said. ``We can't
make any judgments along those lines.''
   He said it was too early to say whether any U.S. representative
would be sent to Pakistan, as funeral arrangements had not yet been
announced.
   Fitzwater also anounced that Reagan telephoned Indiana Sen. Dan
Quayle from the ranch Tuesday night``to congratulate and wish him
well on the upcoming campaign.'' Bush chose Quayle Tuesday as his
running mate in his quest for the presidency.
   The spokesman said the president and First Lady Nancy Reagan
watched Wednesday night's proceedings at the Republican National
Convention on the one television set in their ranch house.
   The weather at the ranch was sunny, and Fitzwater said the
president was spending the day riding horseback, clearing brush,
chopping wood and attending to routine paper work.
   The American Indian Action Group of Goleta, near Santa Barbara,
announced that more than 200 American Indians will gather outside
the ranch Saturday to protest remarks Reagan made about Indian
people during the U.S.-Soviet summit in Moscow in May. Reagan said
the United States might have made a mistake by not urging Indians
to ``be citizens along with the rest of us.''
   Reagan will go to Los Angeles Tuesday, making a stop in Irvine,
Calif., for a fund-raiser for Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.
   Fitzwater said a joint appearance with Bush might be added to
the president's schedule in Los Angeles on Wednesday.
   On Aug. 27, the president will appear at a fund-raiser for the
California Republican Party in Thousand Oaks and one for his
congressman, Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, in Santa Barbara, before
returning to the ranch.

   Conservative spokesmen on Wednesday blessed
the political union of George Bush and Dan Quayle and said their
sometimes divergent groups are united behind the 1988 Republican
presidential ticket.
   Paul Weyrich of the Free Congress Foundation said he thought the
selection of Quayle, a conservative senator from Indiana, as Bush's
vice presidential running mate would boost the ticket's prospects
for winning.
   ``I think the odds have gone from about 70-30 against George
Bush's election to about 50-50,'' Weyrich said at a news conference
attended by other conservative spokesmen.
   Weyrich said he was not swayed to support the Republican ticket
until after the adoption of the party's platform and Bush's
decision to choose Quayle.
   ``When I came here, I was not sure I was going to leave with
wholehearted support for the ticket,'' he said.
   Quayle's conservative credentials could compensate for some
voters' ``initial prejudice'' against him because of his wealth,
Weyrich said.
   Former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, who ran for the 1988 GOP
presidential nomination and lost, said he was ``delighted'' at
Quayle being added to the ticket.
   ``All of us are here to celebrate a conservative ticket ... that
espouses the principles that Ronald Reagan brought to our party in
1980,'' du Pont said.
   Others attending the news conference included Don Devine of
Citizens for Free America and Dr. Robert Grant of Christian Voice.

   Los Angeles is having an identity crisis of
monumental proportion.
   A $40 million monument _ sort of Statue of Liberty West _ will
be built downtown to greet those who drive into the city's core.
   The airspace has already been donated. Money is no problem if
corporate sponsors come through. But how do you capture the mood of
Los Angeles in a way that will make everyone happy?
   More than 150 designs were submitted to an international blue
ribbon panel appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley. The members reduced
the choices to five on Tuesday and will pare that to one by Nov. 6.
   Los Angeles has an identity, but ``we don't know eactly how to
show this identity,'' said French panelist Roland Schweitzer. ``We
have to find it.''
   The shakedown deleted from competition a four-block-long dollar
bill, a 400-foot-tall gold aluminum star, a ``solar-lumetric''
Rainbow Arch with an interior subway, an inflatable sculpture
subject to change with the passing of time, a nude man and woman
holding up the globe and a giant baseball glove.
   The winner could be a transparent eagle whose wings would extend
between offramps with an egg dropping in the center or an untitled
machine-like structure said to fit in with the automobile culture
of Los Angeles that includes a giant video screen facing drivers, a
building offering live performances, a library, food stands and one
emphasizing global communications complete with cinemas and
technological demonstrations.
   Or it could be a series of towering water fountains designed to
create a landmark visible for miles that will drown out traffic
noise.
   Then there is the ``lineal structure projecting the historical
district,'' described as a vessel for social gatherings.
   Or it could be a complex of theaters, galleries and the general
use of open space.

   A Middle Eastern man jailed last week as a
material witness against a suspected terrorist charged in a 1985
airline hijacking was questioned about the case Wednesday in a
sealed courtoom.
   Mouin Abdul Ajam, who was ordered released from custody on
Monday by U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker, was questioned by
prosecutors and a defense lawyer for Fawaz Younis, the defendant
charged with leading the hijacking of the Jordanian airliner,
according to sources familiar with the case.
   Ajam, who was arrested last week in Sacramento, Calif. and
brought here as a material witness against Younis, was questioned
about his identification of the defendant at a court-ordered lineup
earlier this year.
   Younis, who was arrested last September after he was lured to an
FBI-chartered yacht off Cyprus, is awaiting trial on charges he led
the June 11, 1985 hijacking of a Royal Jordanian airliner from
Beirut.
   Ajam, who was a passenger on the airplane, gave a deposition
that was videotaped by prosecutors so it could be replayed at
Younis' trial, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Younis was allowed to attend the questioning session, which was
held in a closed courtroom in U.S. District Court.
   At a hearing last month, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ramsey Johnson
said investigators were searching for a passenger on the plane who
had identified Younis at the earlier lineup.
   Ajam was brought to Washington by U.S. marshals and kept at the
District of Columbia Jail over the weekend until Parker ordered his
release, on condition he give the deposition, the sources said.
   The airliner was hijacked by five armed men who forced the
pilots to fly the aircraft to several locations in the
Mediterranean. The next day, after the 74 passengers and crew were
released, the hijackers blew up the plane.
   No date has been set for the trial of Younis, a former member of
Lebanon's Shiite Amal militia.
   Ajam was said by a lawyer who represented him at a court
proceeding in Sacramento last week to be ``extremely concerned''
that terrorist groups would kill his family members still in
Lebanon if he testified against Younis.
   ``He has every reason to fear retaliation agianst his family in
Beirut,'' said the lawyer, Jessica McGuire.

   The Blue Cross and Blue Shield health
insurance plans reduced their payments to hospitals by $4.8 billion
over a three-year period as a result of cost containment
strategies, according to a study issued Wednesday.
   One significance of the study is that it tends to counter the
common assumption that changes in the way the federal government
reimbursed hospitals for Medicare patients starting in 1983 would
result in hospitals recouping losses from private payors such as
Blue Cross.
   About 40 percent of all hospital bills in the United States are
paid by Medicare, the health insurance program for the disabled and
people over 65 years of age.
   But rather than turn to private insurors to recover losses from
Medicare payments, the study suggested the same efficiencies
imposed on hospital practices by Medicare were reflected in the way
private patients were treated as well.
   Under the prospective payment system Medicare launched in 1983,
hospitals are paid a flat amount for certain procedures, no matter
what the actual cost is.
   For example, the Medicare scale might call for four days
hospitalization for a certain procedure and pay accordingly. If a
particular patient needs to stay five days, the hospital absorbs
the additional cost. If a patient can be discharged after only
three days, the hospital gets to keep the additional money.
   Richard Scheffler, a California health economist who conducted
the study, covering the years 1983 to 1986, said hospitals tended
to apply the guidelines set under Medicare's prospective payment
system to their private patients as well.
   ``It (the prospective payment system) ended up profoundly
changing the overall operation of the hospital,'' Scheffler told a
news conference.
   He said some of the savings realized by Blue Cross and Blue
Shield plans resulted from Medicare-driven changes at hospitals and
some from the private insurors's own cost-containment strategies.
   For example, the study found Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan
customers had approximately 2.3 million fewer hospital admissions
from October 1983 to the end of 1986 due to management techniques
than in the previous three-year period.
   Scheffler, professor of health economics and public policy at
the University of California, Berkeley, also said the total number
of days spent in hospitals by Blue Cross and Blue Shield customers
was down by an estimated 16.7 million during the same period.
   The Blue Cross and Blue Shield strategies ranged from reviewing
the need for hospital stays to requiring a second opinion for
certain surgical procedures, said Scheffler.

   The United States exploded a nuclear
device Wednesday as Soviet scientists exercised their right to
watch under a treaty allowing the superpowers to monitor each
other's tests.
   Dust rose and the desert rippled at ground zero as the test,
code-named Kearsarge, exploded 2,012 feet under the mesa at 10 a.m.
PDT.
   U.S. and Soviet diplomats, scientists and military officials in
the top-secret Nevada Test Site control center, 30 miles away, saw
the surface effects on television monitors but did not feel ground
motion.
   Thirty seconds after detonation, Viktor Mikhailov, leader of the
Soviet technical team, took a telephone call and raised his right
hand with an OK signal, indicating the Soviets had received the
data they were seeking. The signal was greeted with applause.
   Nick Aquilina, manager of the Nevada Operations Office, which
conducts the U.S. nuclear testing program, smiled and shook hands
with scientists.
   ``Everything appears successful so far,'' he told reporters
later.
   James Magruder, the U.S. test controller, called it a
``resounding success.''
   Observers included diplomats who helped forge the agreement in
Geneva last year: Igor Palenykh, head of the Soviet delegation to
the talks; his deputy, Gen. Sergei Zelentsov, deputy head of the
Soviet delegation; and U.S. Ambassador C. Paul Robinson.
   The test was ``a step down the road to a more stable world,''
Robinson said. ``How far we go depends on what we negotiate on the
weapons themselves. I hope we can take the process to the point
where there is no need for weapons at all.''
   Palenykh told reporters before the test that the Soviet Union's
goal is a ban on testing.
   ``As far as the Soviet Union is concerned we are prepared at any
time to cease nuclear testing along with the United States,''
Palenykh said through an interpreter.
   The $25 million test was designed to determine the ability of
each country to accurately measure the other's nuclear tests in
order to preventing cheating on treaties signed in 1974 and 1976
limiting the size of tests to 150 kilotons.
   Both sides have accused the other of exceeding the limits.
   The Soviet Union had 45 nuclear scientists, engineers and
diplomats on hand. A similar number of American scientists will be
on hand for a Soviet test at the Russian site at Semipalatinsk on
Sept. 14.
   U.S. and Soviet scientists monitored the test with equipment
placed in trailers a few hundred yards from ground zero. The
trailers were unmanned at the time of detonation.
   The trailer areas are fenced and armed guards check those
entering and leaving. Signs on the fences state: ``Security Area:
Deadly Force Authorized.''
   Americans may enter the Soviets' trailer area at the Soviets'
invitation.
   President Reagan first suggested such a verification test in a
United Nations speech four years ago. The tests were finally agreed
to by Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev at the
Washington summit in December.
   Soviet scientists were at the Nevada Test Site when six tests
were conducted earlier this year, but Kearsarge was the first event
in which they were involved.
   The test was the ninth conducted at the site this year and the
684th announced shot there since 1951.
   Systems to measure the size of an explosion are considered a key
in ratifying the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976
Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty. Both pacts limit nuclear tests
to 150 kilotons and both sides have accused the other of exceeding
those limits.
   The superpowers are testing their own systems to measure the
size of the tests. The U.S. uses a system called CORRTEX
(Continuous Reflectometry for Radius Versus Time Experiment) which
measures the speed of the underground shock wave. The Soviets use
similar systems to see if they obtain the same data.
   The Nevada Test Site has been the scene of large anti-nuclear
protests but only about 20 anti-nuclear protesters were present
when reporters entered the facility's gates. One protester sat down
in front of a bus but was quickly dragged to the side of the road.

<HEAD>Egypt Supports PLO, Palestinian Provisional Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Egypt said Wednesday it would put all its
resources behind the Palestine Liberation Organization, and
President Hosni Mubarak said the PLO should establish a provisional
Palestinian government.
   After a meeting between Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid and
a high-level PLO delegation, the two sides said they agreed on the
PLO's options and would have further consulations.
   ``President Mubarak has reaffirmed that the Palestinian cause
has Egypt's complete support, and that it is at the forefront of
Egyptian interests,'' Abdel-Meguid said after a 90-minute meeting,
the last after three days of talks with the PLO delegation.
   The group included Mahmoud Abbas and Abdullah Horani, members of
the PLO's executive committee, and Hani al-Hassan, a political
adviser to PLO leader Yasser Arafat. They met with Mubarak on
Tuesday and planned to leave Thursday.
   Egyptian television quoted Abbas as saying that Mubarak agreed
Tuesday that the PLO should establish a provisional Palestinian
government in the Israeli-occupied territories that would draw up
an ``internationally acceptable'' political program.
   PLO officials have said a provisional government would be ready
to recognize Israel in exchange for its recognition of a
Palestinian state in the occupied territories.
   Asked when an announcement of a Palestinian government could be
made, Abbas said any plan would first have to be presented to the
Palestine National Council.
   The council, combining representatives from all PLO factions, is
the legislative arm that makes all major policy decisions. It is
expected to meet in Algeria next month.
   Abdel-Meguid said Egypt would continue consultations with the
PLO and stressed that coordination among Egypt, Jordan and
Palestinian was still necessary.
   Asked about what Egypt thought of a Palestinian
government-in-exile, Abdel-Meguid said, ``Egypt will support what
the Palestinians decide upon.''
   Horani agreed and said the talks with the foreign minister were
``on the basis of our meeting with President Mubarak and his
directives to put Egypt's resources at the disposal of the PLO.''
   The Palestinian delegation arrived Monday from Amman, capital of
Jordan, where they discussed with King Hussein his decision to hand
to the PLO full responsibility for the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip
from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The PLO reportedly is debating whether to declare a state in the
occupied lands, home to about 1.5 million Palestinians. It is also
considering whether to establish a provisional government or a
government-in-exile.
   Abbas, who is also known as Abu-Mazen, said the political
program would ``explain to the world the rational and logical PLO
objectives so as to corner the enemies of our people's independence
and self-determination.''
   He apparently referred to Israel, whose Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir opposes Palestinian self-determination that might lead to
the creation of an independent Palestinian state.

<HEAD>25th Anniversary March Aimed At Reviving King's `Dream'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organizers of a march to commemorate the
largest civil rights demonstration in U.S. history said Wednesday
they aimed to revive the vision set forth in Martin Luther King
Jr.'s ``I have a dream'' speech 25 years ago.
   ``We are concerned ... about the state of `the dream,''' said
Joseph E. Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and a chief planner of the commemorative march.
   ``While the dream has been realized in some respects,'' he told
a news conference, ``in other aspects it has been deferred, it is
in a holding pattern.''
   Other organizers said they expected about 100,000 people to
attend the march Aug. 27.
   The highlight of the 1963 ``March on Washington'' by more than
200,000 people was the spellbinding speech by King, who stood on
the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and declared, ``I have a dream
... ''
   ``... That one day this nation will rise and live out the true
meaning of its creed: `We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal.' I have a dream.''
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, is one of the main organizers
of the commemorative march, along with Benjamin Hooks, executive
director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, and other black leaders.
   Lowery said the two presidential nominees, Democrat Michael
Dukakis and Republican George Bush, had been invited to the march.
He said Dukakis' staff had indicated the Massachusetts governor
planned to attend but that no word had been received from the Bush
camp.
   Leaders of the march will call for legislation to relieve
poverty and joblessness, improve housing and human rights and
combat drugs and AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
Lowery said. They also will urge a moratorium on testing of nuclear
weapons and stiffer sanctions against South Africa.

   State officials Wednesday opened a group
home for unruly teen-agers carrying the AIDS virus.
   The first resident will be a 15-year-old Pensacola boy, who once
was locked in a mental ward by the state to keep him from spreading
the deadly virus.
   The closely supervised but unlocked cottage will house up to six
13- to 17-year-olds who carry the virus that can cause acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, but do not exhibit full-blown symptoms
of the disease.
   The residents will be foster children whose behavior is hard to
control. Many have a history of prostutition or drug use.
   The Pensacola youth was involved in a child pornography ring and
prostitution and continued to have sex after he had been diagnosed
as carrying the virus.
   He first was quarantined, then placed in a locked ward and later
placed in a shelter for juvenile delinquents. He ran away a few
times and has been held at a juvenile detention center in Pensacola.
   About 40 youngsters are eligible for the home, located at a
former institution, said officials of the state Department of
Health and Rehabilitative Services, who will supervise the facility.
   Those who are admitted will stay six months to two years.

   A research project to find ways of killing the
Asian cockroach, a pest that invaded Florida two years ago, has not
been ended and will continue at least through the next fiscal year,
the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Ralph A. Bram, head of research on insects affecting humans and
animals for the department's Agricultural Research Service, said
the agency has ``not closed out any research program aimed at
controlling these pests.''
   Bram said the agency's research budget next year is for $243,700
to be spent on cockroaches, the same as this year. The work is done
at the agency's laboratory in Gainesville, Fla., in cooperation
with the University of Florida.
   The agency said recent published reports, including one in the
St. Petersburg Times, ``implied'' that another USDA scientist,
Richard J. Brenner, said the cockroach will spread to all of the
contiguous 48 states.
   Bram said Brenner actually said there is no way of knowing
exactly how far north the cockroach will migrate. Because of winter
temperatures, he said, it is doubtful the insect would survive
father north than Maryland on the East Coast, Tennessee in the
central area, and lower Washington state in the West.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents, educators, lawyers and doctors
marshalled forces Wednesday against corporal punishment in schools.
   ``We've reached the point of critical mass,'' said Robert
Fathman, chairman of a coalition of 23 medical, legal and
educational organizations, holding the first conference of its kind
in more than a decade.
   Describing corporal punishment as ``a barbaric carryover from
the days of Charles Dickens,'' Fathman said: ``It's no longer a
question of whether we'll be able to abolish the practice, but
when.''
   Eleven states and a number of school districts, ranging in size
from Chicago's to that of Seaford, Del., have outlawed corporal
punishment in schools since New Jersey became the first to do so in
1867.
   Explaining the conference theme, ``The Time is Now,'' Fathman
noted five states have passed measures banning the practice since
1984, six legislatures have bills pending and six states will face
the issue during their 1989 sessions.
   Keynote speaker Bob Keeshan, known to millions of children as
TV's ``Captain Kangaroo,'' called corporal punishment ``a failed
practice. It rates an `F' because it does not meet its stated
purpose of maintaining discipline because it treats the symptoms
and not the cause of the underlying unruly behavior.
   ``With that behavior a child is crying out, `Help me, help me.'
And we answer with the compassion of the paddle,'' said Keeshan.
   ``Seventy years ago, the Soviet Union outlawed the practice ...
and it is the same now in virtually every country in the civilized
world,'' he said. ``Are we so backward that we haven't learned what
all these countries already know?''
   The purpose of the three-day conference that opened Wednesday,
Fathman said, is to provide organizational skills and information
to parents, educators and other interested parties so they can
effectively campaign at local and state levels to eliminate the
practice in schools.
   ``Signs of progress are everywhere,'' said Fathman, head of the
National Coalition to Abolish Corporal Punishment in Schools.
   ``The Little Rock school district has banned corporal
punishment, and that in Arkansas, the worst state ... where 14
percent of the students are paddled each year.''
   According to the U.S. Department of Education, more than a
million incidents of corporal punishment are reported in public
schools each year, ranging from paddling to confining students in
small spaces such as closets.
   Fathman said black children, who represent 16 percent of the
school-age population, make up 32 percent of those punished, and
that children ``in the Deep South are 4,000 times more likely to be
paddled than their counterparts in the Northeast,'' where
Connecticut is the only state without a law barring the practice.
   In a joint statement preceeding the opening of the conference,
the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, the
American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Psychological
Association denounced corporal punishment and called for
legislators to ban it.
   Conference participants said they expected their efforts would
continue to be met with stiff resistance.
   ``A study several years back found that 90 percent of parents
use corporal punishment in their own homes,'' said Adrienne Haeuser
of the National Association of Social Workers. ``That tells us
we've got a lot of educating to do.''

   The Agriculture Department said Wednesday it
is giving $110 million to 46 projects under the Targeted Export
Assistance program for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   Under TEA, as the program is called, various trade organizations
get funds to promote certain agricultural products overseas. The
program is aimed at countering or offsetting what the government
considers unfair foreign trade practices on U.S. exports.
   In most cases, the sponsoring organizations put up some of their
own money in carrying out a specific project, although the amount
of those contributions vary and are subject to negotiation with the
department.
   The $110 million for 1989 is the same as for this year, a level
set by Congress in the 1985 farm law.
   Officials said the biggest amount, $8.9 million, will go to the
U.S. Meat Export Federation to promote red meat, variety meats and
related products. Other leading recipients included: American
Soybean Association, $8.8 million; Cotton Council International,
$7.9 million; and the California Raisin Advisory Board, $7.7
million.

   Q. Senator Quayle, given your original reluctance to support the
INF treaty and given your deep questions about the verification

the administration is now supporting?
   Quayle: I support the ongoing arms control process and the
positions that have been put on the table.
   I believe that the arms control process and the INF treaty,
which I ultimately voted in favor of, is a good process and I think
the INF treaty, seeing an actual reduction and the elimination of
certain classes of weapons is a positive step.
   I also believe that the lesson that should be learned from the
INF treaty, and this should carry over to the START treaty, is that
to get the Soviet Union to the bargaining table and to get any

national security.

<TEXT>
   A human rights group urged Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to tell the truth about the 1968
invasion of Prague and name the Czech leaders who allegedly invited
the troops into their country.
   ``We call on the Soviet leadership ... to provide an open space
for the factual assessment of the events of 1968 and to reach the
appropriate conclusions,'' Charter 77 said in a statement,
according to Palach Press, an emigre publishing house in London.
   The Charter 77 group said the military crackdown by troops and
tanks from five Warsaw Pact nations on Aug. 20-21, 1968 _ the
largest military operation in Europe since World War II _ had ``a
direct influence on the way we live now.''
   ``The Soviet Union should admit its shared responsibility for
the recent Czechoslovak predicament. It should do so not only in
the interests of Czechoslovakia, but also for the sake of the
credibility of its new policies,'' Charter 77 said.
   The invasion crushed a movement of economic and political
reforms espoused by Alexander Dubcek, the Communist Party leader
during the Prague Spring of 1968. Since then, Czechs seemingly have
been reluctant to renew their support for such reforms.
   Charter 77 also demanded in its statement that the names of
Czech leaders who allegedly invited the troops into their country
be made public.
   The Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and East Germany
published a statement in 1968 saying their troops were invited into
Czechoslovakia by leaders who were never publicly identified.
   Gustav Husak, a supporter of the 1968 reforms, took over the
Communist party leadership from Dubcek in 1969. Milos Jakes, a 1968
official who later oversaw a purge of half a million alleged
supporters of Dubcek, succeeded Husak in December 1987.
   Politburo member Vasil Bilak, head of the Communist Party in
1968, lost his post and was denounced as a Soviet collaborator
after the invasion. He regained a powerful position in November
1968 and still wields great influence.
   ``Gorbachev is subjecting the preceding era to extensive
criticism,'' the activists said, and making Czech leaders installed
under Leonid I. Brezhnev ``more and more isolated'' abroad and at
home.
   The group urged Czechoslovakia's 15.5 million citizens ``to
shake off the burden of fear'' and speak openly about the events of
1968.
   ``The government is succumbing to panic,'' the statement said.
``Since the government derives all its legitimacy from the
authority of Brezhnev's tanks, it rejects almost in desperation any
truthful account of what happened twenty years ago.''
   ``(The invasion) became de facto an overture to the later war in
Afghanistan, to the suppression of Solidarity in Poland and to the
policy of intimidation in general,'' the statement said.
   Three Charter 77 spokesmen signed the 1,000-word statement and
planned to deliver it to the Soviet Embassy in Prague on Saturday,
if they are not detained by then. Several leading dissidents have
received police warnings to leave Prague during the anniversary
weekend.
   Among Charter 77's Prague-based spokesmen are prominent
activists Milos Hajek and Bohumir Janat.

<TEXT>
   George Bush's strategists portray the selection
of Sen. Dan Quayle as his running mate as a bold bid for the
nation's younger generation, but analysts warned Wednesday that as
a voting bloc, the baby boom could prove a bust.
   The problem is that the nation's roughly 75 million baby boomers
make up too large a segment of the population to fit into one
ideological category, experts said. Generational links do not
necessarily mean shared politics.
   ``They have different life experiences and certainly different
values'' from their elders, said Democratic pollster Peter Hart.
``But they're such large share of the American population, they
cross all income, occupational and ideological lines.''
   Bush and his aides touted the 41-year-old Quayle as the first
member of the baby boom generation _ usually defined as Americans
born after World War II and before 1965 _ to run on a major-party
ticket for national office.
   ``Do I need help in this area? Sure,'' said Bush. ``And have I
gotten it by the selection of a young, experienced United States
senator? I think so.'' Campaign chief James Baker called it ``a
bold stroke across generations.''
   But some cautioned that the stroke may prove too broad. ``In
general, the baby boomers have not voted as a bloc,'' said
Republican pollster Neil Newhouse. Moreover, ``Young people have
never reliably voted,'' he said.
   Quayle may be able to improve turnout among the one-third of
baby boomers who already identify with the Republican Party,
Newhouse said. But he and others said the next step, drawing new
adherents, may prove more difficult.
   ``Will it encourage younger Democrats, younger independents, to
cross party lines for a candidate of their generation? Who ...
knows,'' he said. ``But there's a shot at that happening.''
   Public policy researcher Edward H. Crane, president of the Cato
Institute in Washington, said he doubted it. While baby boomers are
a diverse group, he said, they share some attributes that do not
dovetail with Quayle's.
   As a proponent of deregulation, entrepreneurship and low taxes,
``Quayle fits on the economic stuff pretty well,'' Crane said. But
he said Quayle's foreign policy views are more hawkish and his
social views more conservative than those of many baby-boomers.
   ``He doesn't have that combination of views that I would argue
is unique to baby boomers,'' said Crane, whose group, which is
nonpartisan, has been a leader in analyzing the baby-boom
generation. ``So he won't be able to appeal to a large group of
them.''
   Republican pollster Linda DiVall said Quayle could have an
impact, so long as it was not overstated.
   ``I don't think anyone is saying that Dan Quayle single-handedly
is going to deliver the baby boom generation,'' she said on the
``CBS This Morning'' television program. ``But I think it's first
time that either of the major parties has made an absolute gesture
of basically passing the torch a couple of generations and saying,
`This is the future leader of our party, this is the way we're
going to go.'''
   There are openings for Quayle. Hart, who studied the baby boom
generation for Rolling Stone magazine, said that younger adults
could find it easier to relate to him ``at least in terms of
appearance and metaphor.'' And Newhouse noted that baby boomers are
less strongly committed to either political party than are older
Americans.
   ``It goes beyond whether you are liberal or moderate or
conservative to what kind of concerns you have,'' Newhouse said.
``If he can demonstrate shared concerns over the things the baby
boom generation is concerned about'' _ such as day care and
education _ ``then he can have a tremendous impact.''

   The city should use horse sense, not just
temperature readings, to decide when the weather's too much for
carriage horses, a city lawmaker said Wednesday.
   Regulations require that horses be given a day off when the
temperature reaches 90 degrees. Humidity is not a factor, although
it should be, City Council Majority Leader Peter Vallone said.
   A furor erupted after Whitey, a 9-year-old gelding, collapsed
Sunday en route from Central Park to his stable blocks away. He has
since recovered, although the ASPCA has ordered him to stop working
for 30 days.
   On Wednesday, Vallone and Councilman Robert Dryfoos held a news
conference along Central Park South, where the carriages
congregate, to decry the horses' working conditions.
   ``It is time for city officials and the public to reach out and
take extra steps to protect these animals, not only for humane
reasons, but because they are an important symbol to the flavor and
charm of this city,'' said Vallone.
   ``I think today is the beginning of fantastic negotiations,''
said Grace Randall, a nurse who saw Whitey collapse and helped save
him.
   But carriage drivers, noting that race tracks allow horses to
run even when it's 100 degrees, said they feel like scapegoats.
   ``I had a woman come up to me yesterday and tell me I'd die in a
rotten hell,'' said Eva Haws, driver of 6-year-old Bubba. ``I've
had people throw things at me, spit on me, push me.
Well-intentioned ignorance is the most dangerous kind.''
   ``Would I work in a business where there is outrageous cruelty?
I'm a vegetarian; I belong to Greenpeace and the antivivisection
movement,'' said Ms. Haws, adding that Bubba gets to stop working
when it's 89 degrees and humid.
   ``I watch the horse's reactions at all times. It doesn't have to
be 90 degrees _ I know when the horse is in stress,'' said the
driver of 10-year-old Katie, who wouldn't give his name.
   Drivers said long, hot spell has caused them financial hardship.
   ``Business is pretty bad. We've lost a lot of income,'' said
George Corler, driver of 9-year-old Fred. ``A lot of people live
off this.''
   Katie's driver said his business had dropped 60 percent because
of the heat spell. ``I just suffer it out, that's all,'' he said.
``If the law says 90 degrees, then that's it.''
   Vallone and Dryfoos urged the public to complain to police and
drivers if they see carriage horses being worked in the extreme
heat.
   They also called for horse shelters and watering stations near
Central Park.
   One city official and a veterinarian are assigned to enforce the
carriage horse ordinances, but they don't work weekends.
``Primarily, the task is left to eight ASPCA agents, who are
already overburdened in enforcing all animal rights laws throughout
the city,'' said Vallone.
   Dryfoos said he is drafting a new ordinance, to be introduced
next fall, covering such issues as weather, rest and watering
periods.

   The U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday
observed a minute of silence and offered eulogies for President
Mohammad Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan.
   Pakistani Ambassador S. Shah Nawaz said Zia ``lost his life

   ``It was with a sense of deep shock and sorrow that I learned of
the tragic death today of President Zia ul-Haq,'' Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar said afer the minute of silence.
``President Zia was a statesman and a farsighted leader who
commanded widespread respect throughout the whole international

   ``As we face this immense loss today, I am sure I voice the
feelings of the entire international community in expressing the
hope that peace and stability will prevail at a critical time in
this sensitive region,'' said Perez de Cuellar.

<HEAD>Gunmen Kill Grocer; Conflicting Claims of Responsibility</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men walked in a grocery
store Wednesday and fatally shot its owner, police said. Two groups
claimed responsibility for the killing.
   Police identified the victim as Frederick Otley, 44, who was
working in a rear storeroom of his store in a Protestant section of
Belfast when the gunmen entered and asked for the owner. When Otley
appeared, they shot him several times and fled, police said.
   The Irish National Liberation Army, an extreme Marxist offshoot
of the Irish Republican Army, claimed responsibility for the
shooting in a statement to the British Broadcasting Corp. in
Belfast.
   But the Irish News, a Belfast newspaper, said it received a
statement claiming responsibility from the Irish Revolutionary
Brigade, a group previously unheard of in Northern Ireland.
   Both news organizations said the statements they received were
accompanied by authenticating passwords.
   In 1985, Otley was accused by an informer of terrorist crimes on
behalf of the Protestant paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force, and
was charged with a bombing at a social club which was meant to kill
a force member during an inter-organization feud.
   The charges were dropped when the informer retracted his
statement.
   The British domestic agency Press Association reported that the
murder may have been in retaliation for Protestant guerrillas'
killings of two Catholics last week in Belfast.
   Seamus Morris, 18, and Peter Dolan, 25, were gunned down in a
shopping center in the Catholic Ardoyne area of north Belfast. The
Protestant Action Force, reportedly linked with the Ulster
Volunteer Force, claimed responsibility.
   The IRA has been fighting to drive the British from the
Protestant-dominated province and unite it with the overwhelmingly
Catholic Irish Republic under socialist rule.

   The airplane crash in Pakistan that killed the
country's president and the U.S. ambassador also took the life of
an American Army general, the Pentagon said today.
   ``The Defense Department has been informed that Brig. Gen.
Herbert M. Wassom was aboard the plane,'' said Lt. Col. Keith
Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman.
   Wassom, 49, was the chief U.S. defense representative to
Pakistan and would have been traveling routinely with U.S.
Ambassador Arnold L. Raphel.
   Schneider said the Pentagon did not know of any other Americans
on the plane besides Raphel and Wassom.
   The Pakistani official radio confirmed today that Raphel and
President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq were killed when their Pakistani
military plane exploded in the eastern part of the country.
   The Pakistan air force C-130 transport plane with 37 people
aboard had just taken off from Bahawalpur, 330 miles southwest of
Islamabad, when it exploded about 4:30 p.m. (7:30 a.m. EDT), the
report said. A government statement read over the radio said no one
aboard the plane survived.
   Wassom was named the senior American defense representative to
Pakistan in July 1987. An Army general who won his star in
September 1985, Wassom held a bachelor's degree in industrial arts
from Western Kentucky University and a master's degree in
international relations from George Washington University.
   A native of Rockwood, Tenn., Wassom was trained as an artillery
and missile officer and served in Vietnam. He rose through a
variety of command positions with the 101st Airborne Division in
the 1970's before becoming the head of the 528th Army Artillery
Group in the U.S. Army Southern European Task Force in 1980.
   In 1981, Wassom became the deputy director of the staff for the
Army's chief of staff in Washington, then in 1983 became the chief
of staff for the 101st at Fort Campbell, Ky., He later served as
the assistant division commander for the 101st before assuming the
post in Pakistan.
   Wassom had earned numerous decorations, including the Legion of
Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster; the Bronze Star, and the Defense
Meritorious Service Medal.
   ``He was a very capable guy who was extremely well liked,'' said
one Pentagon official.
   Defense sources also disclosed today the United States had
already extended to Pakistan an offer to assist in any way possible
the investigation of the accident.
   ``There are no indications yet of any external cause for this
crash,'' said one official.
   ``But we have offered assistance ranging from forensic work to
sending over folks from the Federal Aviation Administration and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.''

<HEAD>Composer Says Best Birthday Present Would Be Time to Write</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN LUMSDEN</BYLINE>

   Leonard Bernstein says the only gift he
wants for his 70th birthday is more time to write music.
   ``I have everything. I am blessed and grateful,'' the nation's
best-known conductor and composer said. ``I have no further
requests of fate except time.
   ``Of course, I'd like to see a few more grandchildren,'' he
added.
   The composer of ``West Side Story'' and ``Candide'' held a rare
news conference at the Tanglewood Music Center, where he began his
conducting career.
   The music festival is preparing a four-day extravaganza next
week in honor of the illustrious graduate's birthday. Among the
performers at the birthday night performance Aug. 25 will be such
friends as actress Lauren Bacall and diva Beverly Sills.
   Bernstein played down the festivities that Tanglewood officials
have promised will be one of the music world's great occasions.
   ``I'm not celebrating anything. I'm just at Tanglewood,'' he
said, chain-smoking and sweating after a vigorous hour spent
conducting the Tanglewood student orchestra in his ``Songfest'' in
preparation for Sunday's performance.
   The flamboyant maestro, wearing his trademark red bandanna
necktie, forbade any mention of the word ``birthday,'' saying,
``Every time someone says that word I feel a year older.''
   The celebration comes in the middle of a busy schedule for
Bernstein, who has recently returned from conducting ``Songfest''
in the Soviet Union. He will tour at least 20 more cities by
December.
   Despite his busy schedule, however, he said his chief aim was to
write ``the tons of music I haven't written yet.''
   He refused to talk about the pieces he is working on, except to
say he was collaborating with choreographer Martha Graham on a
ballet and taking musical risks with his recent ``obsession'' with
voice.
   He recently conducted Puccini's ``La Boheme'' in Rome with a
cast of young Americans.
   ``I've always associated `Boheme' with Greenwich Village and my
life as a young bohemian,'' he said. Bernstein was a member of the
original Tanglewood Music Center class of 1940, where he became a
protege of Tanglewood founder Serge Koussevitzky.
   ``I feel I built the bloody place,'' he said Wednesday.
   When Koussevitzky retired in 1949, he tried to have the young
Bernstein named as his successor. The Boston Symphony Orchestra's
trustees, however, considered Bernstein too young and tainted by
popular music.
   Bernstein declined Wednesday to sum up his prodigious
accomplishments as recording artist, conductor, composer and
musician.
   ``That's your problem,'' he told the 50 reporters and admirers
at the news conference. ``I'm too busy. I can't think about things
like that, to assess myself or to place myself in various
categories of ranks or to decide whether I've achieved everything
or a portion or a fraction.''
   ``I feel as though I've lived many, many lifetimes ... more than
I had any right to expect.''

<HEAD>North Korea Agrees on Border Talks With South Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korean and South Korean
delegates will meet Friday to prepare for a joint parliamentary
session on a non-aggression pact and the communist nation's demand
to be a co-host the Olympics.
   South Korea's National Assembly said North Korea's Supreme
People's Assembly agreed Wednesday by telephone to send five
delegates to the truce village of Panmunjom.
   The meeting will be the first between the two nations in three
years.
   The last time was in December 1985 at Red Cross talks. But the
North shelved all dialogue in early 1986 to protest regular
military exercises between South Korea and the United States.
   The latest flurry of overtures began July 21, when North Korea
proposed a joint session of the two parliaments to draft a
non-aggression pact. That was followed by another proposal that
Olympics issues be added to the meeting.
   North Korea has said it will boycott the Sept. 17-Oct. 2
Olympics unless it is allowed to be a co-host. South Korea and
international Olympics officials rejected the demand, but have
offered several compromise proposals.
   North Korea originally proposed this week's meeting be held
Wednesday, but South Korea suggested the switch to Friday to avoid
dampening celebrations marking a 30-day countdown to the Olympics.
   South Korea's opposition parties welcomed North Korea's
agreement.
   ``We hope the South-North parliamentary talks would provide an
opportunity for realizing national unification,'' said a message
from the main opposition Party for Peace and Democracy.
   In Wednesday's telephone message, North Korea did not mention
its earlier demand for full-fledged parliamentary talks, according
to sources in the South Korean assembly. The two sides have been in
disagreement over Pyongyang's demand to include all representatives
in the main legislative conference.
   North Korea also says Friday's meeting should discuss only
logistical arrangements for larger talks. South Korea wants to take
up procedural matters, including the agenda and the number of
participants for the full negotiations.
   The conflicting stands cast doubt on the prospects of main
parliamentary talks between the two Koreas, left divided in 1945 at
the end of World War II.
   South Korean government officials have expressed doubts over the
North Korean proposal. Some officials interpreted it as an attempt
to stir unrest before the Olympics or to find an excuse to skip the
Games.

<HEAD>Bentsen Hustles Native Texas for Conservative Votes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen zigzagged across Texas looking for conservative votes
Wednesday, and he flexed his muscles at the prospect of his matchup
with Sen. Dan Quayle on the Republican ticket.
   Back in Washington, Bentsen's office released financial
statements showing his grossincome averaged $772,181 annually over
the past five years, including more than $1 million in 1983.
   Medical records made public at the same time showed Bentsen was
in generally good health.
   Bentsen flew west from Fort Worth to meet with farmers and
ranchers at a wool warehouse in San Angelo and speak at a historic
Western fort. He then viewed a medicine-by-television project in
Lubbock and planned to return to East Texas at day's end.
   ``I know that this county is principally Republican,'' Bentsen
told the 250 people at Fort Concho in San Angelo. ``I also know
that Lloyd Bentsen carried this county by 58 percent last time.''
   He turned to the more difficult task of selling Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis to his fellow Texans. Bentsen
said his selection as the Massachusetts governor's running mate
showed that Dukakis was ``reaching out... ready to listen to
differing viewpoints.''
   Bentsen also implied that George Bush, who was born in New
England but claims Houston as his home, was not a real Texan.
   ``There is only one on the ticket who was born and reared on a
farm in Texas,'' he told the crowd.
   Bentsen was accompanied during the day by Rep. Charles Stenholm
of Texas, a leader of the band of conservative Democrats in
Congress who supported President Reagan in his first term.
   Stenholm told the San Angelo meeting that Bentsen was the only
person on either ticket with ``tractor-seat common sense.'' The
congressman didn't even mention the liberal Dukakis' name.
   At Texas Tech, Bentsen took part in a demonstration of a two-way
television hookup that enables doctors at the medical center to
help diagnose and treat patients in rural areas where medical care
is scarce.
   Bentsen said he helped win financing for the project in
Congress. He decried the loss of 23 rural hospitals in Texas in the
past year, a trend he said he was trying to stop as chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee by changing the rules governing federal
hospital assistance.
   Bentsen seemed to relish the prospect of debating Quayle, tapped
as Bush's vice presidential running mate, on Oct. 11 in Omaha,
Neb., if Quayle accepts the challenge.
   ``I guess we'll have an early season on quail,'' he told
reporters.
   Bentsen, 67, dismissed questions about the ``youth factor''
represented by the 41-year-old Quayle. Bentsen said he had worked
out with weights on a treadmill in his hotel room Wednesday
morning, and had increased his usual four-pound barbells to five
pounds.
   ``It's not the miles on you, it's the depth of the tread,'' he
said, implying that he considers Quayle a political lightweight.
   Bentsen's office released medical records which showed the
senator was in generally good health although he was treated for
high cholesterol and two small skin lesions.
   Reporters joked with Bentsen's wife, B.A., that the doctors
would report he'd have ``the body of a 41-year-old.''
   ``You bet,'' she replied. ``No question about it.''

   Q. Senator Quayle, I'd like to ask both of you this question,
but Senator Quayle, you are, it has been quoted that your net worth
is $200 million. Is this correct, and if so, isn't this going to
put off the blue collar _
   Bush: Why do you think I chose him? (Laughter.)
   Q. _ isn't this going to off the blue collar vote and the low
income vote?
   Quayle: That figure is not correct and believe me you have
caused me a lot of problems at home because my wife is asking about
that.
   And we will be releasing all of our tax returns, and you'll be
able to figure out that it's far less than what you said.
   Yes, sir?
   Q. Mr. Vice President, you've been very critical of Governor
Dukakis for not being specific enough. Now that you've chosen a
running mate, will you be specific about how many times you'll
debate Governor Dukakis, and in what forums?
   Bush: We'll be addressing ourselves to the debate question very
soon.
   There will be debates.
   I'm going to ask Jim Baker to initiate the discussions, and, I
thought there was a little presumptuous to go charging forward
before you even are officially nominated by the party.
   Yes, sir?
   Q. Mr. Vice President, as you reviewed your contenders, the
candidates for the office, how important were the qualities of
loyalty and compatibility to you?
   Bush: Well, I said ahead of time, before I selected Senator
Quayle, that there should be some philosophical compatibility.
   Now, there are some issues where he and have differed, and
probably will differ, but he's known for his frankness.
   He'll be able to come down if I'm elected and open that door to
the Oval Office, as I can do today, and give me his judgment.
   And that's what I want.
   But we aren't going off on two entirely different directions,
like the Democratic ticket.
   And we'll be presenting a unified, forward-looking message on
the economy and on world peace, and on education, and these key
priorities for the American people.
   We won't have to debate each other, so that the American people
understand these differ _ Norm?

<HEAD>In Quayle's Hometown, Pride Comes Before Politics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS P. WYMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of Dan Quayle's hometown are
beaming with pride, shaking off their surprise and putting partisan
politics aside as they prepare a welcome for the GOP's soon-to-be
vice presidential candidate.
   With George Bush's selection of Quayle as his running mate,
Huntington's favorite son became overnight the favorite of GOP
delegates from thousands of American hometowns.
   ``I'm really happy to see a younger person get involved,'' said
Maxine Miller, a Republican and 42-year resident of Huntington. ``I
think the country needs that.''
   Delegates to the Republican National Convention in New Orleans
will ratify Quayle's selection after formally handing Bush the
presidential nomination Wednesday.
   Huntington's 16,000 residents will get their first glimpse of
Quayle as a vice presidential candidate when he returns Friday with
Bush for a noon ceremony at the courthouse.
   By Wednesday afternoon, the town was shaking off its surprise
that the 41-year-old Quayle had bested competition from older and
better-known candidates.
   ``I guess (Sen. Robert) Dole and (Rep. Jack) Kemp weren't my
choices, and I didn't think it would be a woman,'' said Ms. Miller
over lunch Nick's Kitchen, where Quayle often stops for coffee.
``You don't hear bad things about him around the town or the
county.''
   During his two terms in the House and eight years in the Senate,
Quayle appears to have ruffled few feathers back home, even among
Democrats.
   ``I'm sure we'll have a good turn out Friday,'' said Mayor Ron
Schenkel, a Democrat and Quayle's former high school classmate.
``It's not going to be just a Republican rally. I'm sure I won't be
the only Democrat there.''
   Russell J. McCurdy, 71, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant
colonel, says he's another likely Democratic voter who will attend
the rally. ``More power to a local man that has made good and done
good,'' he said.
   But the staunch conservatism of the Quayle family and of The
Herald-Press newspaper published by his father does raise the
partisan wrath of some, including Ray Ade, a retired Democratic
circuit court judge.
   ``I know his father _ nice man, fine fellow. But I've never
heard Dan say a decent word about a Democrat, and that's about the
way I feel about him,'' said Ade. ``There's nothing wrong about
Dan, but I've never heard anything great about him, either.''
   Despite the election of an occasional Democrat, Huntington is a
politically conservative city built by Irish and German immigrants
and dependent on light industry for jobs since the Erie-Lackawana
Railroad failed, says Michael V. Perkins, the managing editor of
The Herald-Press.
   Quayle's father, James, owns the paper, and Quayle himself
worked as business manager in the 1970s before entering politics.
   ``I think the community is surprised and proud and looking
forward for the opportunity to put its best foot forward,'' Perkins
said.
   Virgyle Hougendobler, an electrical contractor who rewired the
Quayle home when the senator was a boy, remembers the youthful
Quayle as quick-minded.
   ``He was always curious. He was always around behind you, seeing
what was going on,'' he said.
   In later years, Hougendobler said, ``He was always kind of fun
to run into because his mind was always running.''
   Schenkel says he wasn't among Quayle's close friends in high
school, but remembers him as a ``normal'' student.
   ``He liked to raise hell, like all of us at that age, and have a
good time,'' he said. ``He was just a regular guy.''

accidentally exploded a hand grenade at a rural funeral, killing
himself and 12 civilians and wounding 20 others, authorities said
Wednesday.
   The grenade went off Tuesday night in a home full of mourners on
the outskirts of Santiago de Maria, about 70 miles east of the
capital, said Defense Ministry spokesman Col. Jose Galileo Torres.
   Speaking by telephone, Torres identified the soldier as Hector
Tulio Garcia Mendoza. He said the soldier was on leave and drunk at
the time.
   Torres said the army tries to prevent soldiers from taking
weapons when they go on leave, ``but they always manage to take
them out for their own protection when they visit their hometowns,
where the guerrillas know them.''
   Many soldiers on home leave have been killed by rebels, Torres
said.
   The U.S.-backed government has been fighting a war against
leftist guerrillas for nine years, with an estimated 65,000 people
killed, mostly civilians.
   A police source in Santiago de Maria said by telephone that the
grenade went off Tuesday night in a home where a child's wake was
being held. The child died earlier in the day of natural causes.
   Authorities gave no details on why the soldier pulled the pin
from the grenade.
   The soldier belonged to the army's 6th Infantry Brigade, the
source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The unit is
deployed in that area of Usulutan province because of frequent
activity by leftist guerrillas.
   The explosion killed the soldier and 10 civilians almost
instantly, the source said. He said two more civilians died soon
after, and 20 people were wounded.

   They say they eat food from garbage cans, get
their clothes in thrift stores, and wander the country, taking
their politics seriously.
   They might be called modern-day hobos, but they call themselves
anarchists and at the Republican National Convention, which has
drawn few protesters, this band stands out.
   ``We don't think our lifestyle is appropriate for everyone,''
says Mark Kynik of New Orleans. ``But we do think people should
take control of their communities and resources _ the land, the
oil, banks _ and use it for the good of all, not just a few.
   ``That's what anarchy is about,'' he said.
   Anarchists see nothing good in American politics. They also
protested last month in Atlanta at the Democratic National
Convention. About 30 are in town for the GOP convention.
   The group, most in their early 20s, say there are many more like
them across the nation. Many met during the Great Peace March of
1986 and have been protesting ever since.
   Their appearance in New Orleans has made little impact. It is
likely that only a few, if any, delegates noticed.
   The group staged one demonstration at a city park this week,
watched by a few policemen and a reporter or two. It was
``guerrilla theater,'' with the members banging pots with sticks.
Then they destroyed a television set to ``smash illusions'' created
by the media.
   At another demonstration, about 20 of them marched in the middle
of rush-hour traffic toward the Superdome, where the GOP convention
was being held.
   Karen Eliot, 21, who described herself as an Army brat
originally from North Carolina, said she became an anarchist after
she dropped out of college to self-educate herself.
   ``This lifestyle is so much healthier to me. There is no one
telling you what to do,'' she said as she took a break between
protests and rolled a cigarette.
   In New Orleans, many of them say they are staying at a house
with Steve Vermont, 22, sleeping on floors with blankets.
   ``Most of us know each other through anarchist networks,'' says
Vermont. ``In the winter a lot of us settle in one place, maybe
work as a janitor or dishwasher, and save half the money. Then in
the summer we travel.''
   They also sell their blood to blood banks and panhandle, and
``Dumpster Dive,'' gathering day-old bread and vegetables from
trash bins behind restaurants and supermarkets. The trash cans also
are good source for clothes (they favor T-shirts, jeans and
military-style boots).
   The anarchists do not seem miffed that few people appear to be
heeding their message.
   ``We work pretty quietly,'' Vermont said. ``We don't have a
party line or a rap. We're asking people to think for themselves.
You can't get that message across in five seconds on TV.''

   Q. Mr. Vice President, President Reagan ran pretty well among
young people in 1984, and you haven't. What makes you think that
the problem is just a lack of youth on the ticket?
   Bush: I think I have.
   I think I did well with young people in primaries.
   I think we won the nomination earlier than a lot of us,
collectively, thought I'd win it.
   And you go back and analyze it, I think you'll see I did very
well amongst young people.
   Now wait a minute _ do I need help in this area?
   Sure. And have I gotten it by the selection of a young,
experienced United States senator? I think so.
   Q. Well, let me _
   Bush: Way in the back.
   Q. Mr. Vice President, are you going to send Senator Quayle to
the Middle West, and is that going to be the campaign battleground?
   Bush: It, there will not be a simple regional program where he
spends all his time in one area and I spend my time in another, but
I feel that he can be extraordinarily helpful in the Middle West.
   We haven't been in the back of the room. Yes, sir?
   Q. Mr. Vice President, you have said that it's going to look
like a fight between two pit bulls. We've already seen Governor
Dukakis referred to as a diminutive clerk or as Pee Wee Herman. Is
it going to get worse than that?
   Bush: No, I don't think either Senator Quayle or I will be that
colorful rhetorically.
   And I recall being on the receiving end of a barb or two at the
Democratic National Convention.
   Didn't hurt much, like getting hit with a marshmallow out there.
   But I think all we have to do is talk about the issues, and I'll
be doing a little of that in my speech tomorrow, and both the
senator and I will be doing a lot of that in the campaign.
   And if we can spell it out, if we can compel him to be as
specific as I have been, and as both of us will be, then I think we
will have made real headway.
   You don't have to resort to name-calling, out of the Democratic
convention, or out of the Republican convention.
   Susan?

<HEAD>Unisys Says It Will Plead Guilty In Army Contract Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Unisys Corp. has told the Securities and
Exchange Commission that the defense contractor plans to plead
guilty in federal court to three counts of labor mischarging on an
Army contract in Arizona, a company spokesman said Wednesday.
   The company's plans were outlined in a filing required by the
SEC to outline any company actions that might affect stockholders,
according to Bill Beckham, a Unisys spokesman.
   The $9.2 million contract involves administrative and computer
work for the Army Information Systems Command at Ft. Huachuca,
Ariz. The case is not related to the ongoing Pentagon bribery
investigation, in which Unisys also has been mentioned, although no
charges have been filed.
   The Unisys-Army probe is being conducted by the U.S. attorney's
office in Tucson, Ariz., and is one of three federal
investigations, outside of the Pentagon case, made public in a July
19 letter from Michael Blumenthal, chairman of Unisys, to employees.
   Bluementhal's letter said the three other investigations were
under way before the November, 1986 merger between the Sperry Corp.
and Burroughs, which created Unisys. The Ft. Huachuca contract
involves a former Sperry office in Sierra Vista, Ariz.

<HEAD>Two Army Officers Accused in Killings By Death Squads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two army officers were charged Wednesday
with involvement in a political assassination by right-wing death
squads.
   The leftist Patriotic Union party has long claimed the army is
behind the death squads, which have killed 800 people in the last
three years. This is the first time any army officers have been
charged.
   The army captain and major were accused of plotting the
assassination of Alvaro Garces Parra, mayor of Sabana Torres and
one of more than 600 members of the Patriotic Union party killed by
the death squads.
   Garces was shot to death Aug. 16, 1987, in his northeast
Colombian town. The Colombia attorney general's office said Capt.
Luis Orlando Ardila Orjuela and Maj. Oscar Echandia Sanchez
supplied weapons to the killers.
   Echandia had one of the paid assassins admitted to a hospital as
a soldier after he was wounded in the attack, the attorney
general's office said.
   The assassin died in the hospital. Among his belongings was
found a safe conduct pass signed by Ardila, the attorney general's
office said.
   On the day of the murder, the two officers met with three men
believed to be members of a death squad known as the Crickets, the
attorney general's office said. Arrest orders also were issued for
the three men.

<HEAD>President Criticizes Unchecked Inflation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Raif Dizdarevic said
inflation is continuing at a runaway 190 percent this year, it was
reported Wednesday.
   Statistics officials took issue with Dizdarevic's figures,
saying the annual rate of inflation actually has decreased compared
with last year.
   In a speech at a Bosnian industrial town delivered Monday,
Dizdarevic said prices in the first seven months of this year had
been rising at a rate of about 190 percent, the official Tanjug
news agency reported.
   The government had hoped to keep the inflation rate down to 95
percent, he said. That is the figure demanded by the International
Monetary Fund for rescheduling of Yugoslavia's $21 billion debt.
   Statistics officials, however, said the 190 percent inflation
figure pertained to the entire period from July 1987 to July 1988.
   For the first eight months of this year alone, they expect
inflation to be only 90 percent. But then it is projected to rise
to 150 percent by the end of this year, the officials said.
   Even that would be down somewhat from the 170 percent inflation
rate reached in the 1987 calendar year.
   Dizdarevic also said in his speech that foreign exchange
reserves had increased significantly, with hard currency from
tourism and money sent home by Yugoslavs working abroad. The number
of such workers is growing ``much faster than expected,'' he said.
   Yugoslavia is undergoing economic reforms that include
liberalizing price and import regulations to orient the economy
toward the market. Dizdarevic said the federal body charged with
carrying out the reform is optimistic, Tanjug said.

   Q. Senator Quayle, there's been so much made of the fact you're
a baby-boomer. Maybe you can give us a little picture of yourself
graduating in 1969, Vietnam era. You chose to go in the National
Guard rather than to serve in Vietnam. Can you give us a little bit
of what you were thinking during that time?
   Quayle: Well, growing up in Huntington, Ind., the first thing
you think about is education.
   You think about what any small town person would think about,
eventually growing up, raising a family.
   I was fortunate enough to be able to go on to law school, meet
my wife. We have _ been blessed by three beautiful children.
   We're very happy, very content, and looking forward to a very
exciting campaign.
   I did not know in 1969 that I would be in this room today, I'll
confess.
   Q. Why the National Guard rather than serving in the Army, the
Marines, the Navy, and therefore going to Vietnam?
   Quayle: My brother and I, two years younger, both went into the
service at the same time, about the same time.
   He went into the Marine Corps and I went into the National Guard.
   I went into the National Guard and I served six years there,
1969 through 1975.
   Bush: We got to go to this side of the room. Maria Smith, no,
whoops, go ahead, Pat, one, two.
   Q. Mr. Bush, you had originally planned to make this
announcement either later today or tomorrow, and there have been
some complaints that making it on Tuesday, in effect, diluted the
message last night. You didn't get the sharp criticism of Dukakis
out or the conservative message. In retrospect, was it a mistake do
you think, to go ahead with the announcement?

<HEAD>NEW ORLEANS: the announcement.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush: No, I think it was a sound decision, I think it has
captured the imagination of this convention, and I really believe
that it was the right thing to do, and the delegates that I've
talked to, which haven't been many, and the people I've talked to,
again not too many because I've been working on my speech, but as I
move around, saw some this morning at the agricultural breakfast,
there's great enthusiasm.
   And let me tell you why I made this choice.
   I set my mind, I mean, timing of it. I set my mind to doing it,
making a decision, before I got to New Orleans.
   I did that. We had a thorough practice. We did not make joint
appearances with candidates and have the applause meter running out
there to suggest who was the most popular.
   But I did get some concern that, having made up my mind, that if
we left it dangling out there, there would be an accusation, and
properly so I felt, that I was, you know, not treating those who
had been considered for this job with the dignity to which they
were entitled.
   And that's why I sped up the process, and it worked and I think
it's had wide _ yes, ma'am, here in the front.
   Q.: You've been campaigning very hard for the Hispanic vote.
Yesterday you made the comment about, my three little brown
children. Some Hispanics have been offended by that. Can you
clarify what you meant by that?
   Bush: Let me tell you something about that.
   Those grandchildren are my pride and joy.
   And when I say pride, I mean it.
   And anybody that has ever traveled with me or knows the
heartbeat of the Bush family, knows not only my sensitivity, but my
love for those children.
   And for anyone to suggest that that comment of pride is anything
other than what it was, I find it personally offensive and, P.S., I
don't want to see these kids hurt.
   And they weren't hurt by what I said, and if they're hurt by
misinterpretation, that isn't fair.
   And I don't like it.
   And this is my family and I'm going to protect them.
   And I'm delighted you raised it, because I have heard the
question raised.
   And this heart knows nothing but pride and love for those three
children and you're going to see them with me every inch of the way.
   Yes? Last one. Last one.
   Q. Mr. Vice President, since you don't want the Republican Party
to seem like a party of the rich, for the rich _ once again a
question about personal finance: Why pick another millionaire for a
running mate?
   Bush: I picked the best man to be vice president of the United
States.
   It isn't a question of personal wealth.
   It's personal, how you keep this country going so more people
can benefit by this, the longest recovery in history.
   It's those who care about others, and his leadership and this
Job Training Partnership Act, really something sensational.
   And so, I don't think it's a question of personal wealth.
   If it were, the Democratic ticket would be in deep trouble, too.
   Thank you all very, very much.

   George Bush made extensive notes on potential
running mates on legal pads and reviewed them closely last weekend
before making his final choice of Sen. Dan Quayle, aides said
Wednesday.
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, also disclosed for the
first time the complete list of 12 also-rans.
   They included Sen. Bob Dole and his wife, former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole; New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu,
California Gov. George Deukmejian, South Carolina Gov. Carroll
Campbell, Gov. Jim Thompson of Illinois, Sens. John Danforth of
Missouri, Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Pete Domenici of New Mexico,
Rep. Jack Kemp, and Attorney General Richard Thornburgh.
   Bush called the 11 on Tuesday before talking with Quayle, Fuller
told a group of reporters.
   The 12th person on Bush's list, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas,
was not called because she had removed herself from contention,
Fuller said.
   The list did not include some other prominent Republicans who
were thought to be under consideration, including Howard Baker, a
former senator and chief of staff to President Reagan, and former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander.
   Robert Teeter, Bush's pollster, said that his own past work with
Quayle gave him added insight into the Indiana lawmaker's
vote-drawing abilities.
   ``He is a first-rate campaigner,'' Teeter said. ``He can help
out among marginal Democrats and blue-collar workers.'' Teeter did
polling for Quayle in his congressional races in the late 1970s and
in his two Senate races in the 1980s.
   Quayle ``never had a gender gap problem'' in any of those races,
Teeter said. Teeter said he did not push Quayle in his
conversations with Bush, despite his long relationship with the
Indiana senator.
   Roger Ailes, Bush's media adviser, also helped Quayle in his
1980 and 1986 Senate races. ``I had a chance to observe him first
hand,'' Ailes said in a separate interview. He declined to say
whether he had advocated Quayle's selection to Bush.
   Campaign sources, in fact, said that Ailes believed Bush would
select Kemp.
   ``It doesn't make any difference what we wanted. What mattered
is what the vice president wanted,'' Teeter said.
   Teeter and Fuller described Bush's process in reaching his final
decision as complex _ beginning with surveying Republican senators
on whom they thought would be the best choice among themselves, and
doing the same with House members, governors and party leaders.
   But in the end, Bush kept his own counsel. He wrote the names
and information on each candidate ``on long legal pads''' and
studied them in Washington over the weekend to help make his final
decision, Fuller said.
   Said Teeter: ``The presumption that we sat down and made a list
of what we wanted demographically and tried to create a candidate
is just not true.''
   Quayle's age, 41, turned out to be a strong suit in Bush's mind,
said Teeter. And so did ``chemistry.''
   ``One of the most important things about a candidate for public
office is just to be interesting,'' he said, adding that Quayle
would be ``interesting to a large group of voters.''
   ``I think you've got a group of voters who now have a candidate
of their own generation ... that alone will make him an interesting
pick to a large number of voters.''
   ``Someone of that age symbolically will be popular,'' Teeter
continued.
   Questions on Quayle's association with former model Paula
Parkinson and the fact that he went into the National Guard in 1969
instead of joining another service that could have brought him into
combat in Vietnam were closely scrutinized, Fuller and Teeter said.
   Quayle _ as other candidates _ also was queried on whether he
had ever used illegal drugs, the aides said.
   His response was that he had not, they said.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle face off in
their first vice presidential debate, it won't be the first time
the senators have debated on television.
   The senators went head-to-head four months ago on public
television's MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour. Their segment concerned a
trade bill eventually vetoed by President Reagan for its
controversial plant closing notification requirement.
   PBS has released the transcript of the April 22 show, billing it
as ``the only known televised debate between the two candidates.''
   Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee,
called the 60-day notification requirement ``a very mild proposal
that says if you've been working for a company 25, 30 years, you
deserve something better than a 7-day layoff'' if your plant is
going to close.
   ``When I was in business, and running a company, I closed down a
division,'' Bentsen added. ``I gave them 90 days' notice and it
worked out very well.''
   Rejoined Quayle, R-Ind., ``I think companies should give notice.
... The objection to it is the federal government coming in and
mandating on a legislative basis on how a company is going to close
its plant. ... Our judiciary is now going to get involved in
determining whether a plant is closed properly or not. It takes
away flexibility.''
   Bentsen called the plant-closing provision ``a peripheral
issue'' in a giant trade bill, ``magnified by the administration''
even after senators accomodated objections in other areas. He also
said most companies already give 60-day notices and those with
fewer than 100 employees would be exempted.
   But Quayle countered that the bill's financial penalties would
deter businesses with just over 100 employees from taking risks.
   And when Bentsen contended the trade bill was critical to stem
the nation's rising trade deficit, Quayle retorted, ``You would
think that perhaps the economy is going in the wrong direction.''
He then listed increases in exports, industrial growth, domestic
auto sales and jobs.
   Quayle and Reagan ultimately lost their battle.
   The Senate went on to pass the trade bill, Reagan vetoed it and
Bentsen devised the successful strategy of putting the
plant-closing provision into a separate measure. This time an
election-conscious Senate passed the provision overwhelmingly and
Reagan, tacitly acknowledging defeat, let it become law without his
signature.

<HEAD>Hinckley Attorneys Seek To Block Release of Letters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense attorneys accused prosecutors
Wednesday of trying to ``inflame public passion'' against John W.
Hinckley Jr. by seeking to release letters written by the man who
shot President Reagan.
   The attorneys asked U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker to
deny the government's application to release the letters. The
application prompted a mental hospital holding Hinckley to withdraw
a proposal to take him on a field trip with other patients.
   Hinckley has been held at St. Elizabeths Hospital here since
1982, when he was acquitted by reason of insanity of shooting and
wounding President Reagan, White House press secretary James S.
Brady and two others on March 30, 1981.
   ``By disclosing the sealed documents now, the government hopes
to inflame the public passion against Mr. Hinckley,'' the defense
lawyers said in a court filing.
   ``Such publicity might prejudice his rights to fair and
impartial treatment of his illness in the future because of the
potential unwillingness of both Mr. Hinckley and the hospital staff
to deal with such a negative portrayal.
   ``More importantly it risks damaging the very treatment
relationship of confidence and trust that must exist for Mr.
Hinckley to make any progress in his fight against mental illness.''
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens last week asked Parker to release
the letters Hinckley wrote, saying they were of great public
interest.
   Defense attorneys Vincent Fuller and Judith Miller said Hinckley
had a property right to the letters, which they contended were
obtained only because government investigators had been given
copies of Hinckley's medical records to prepare for a hearing on
the hospital's proposal to include him in the field trip.
   ``The government did not obtain the materials at issue entirely
on its own,'' the lawyers said. ``Instead, it relied upon the
documents produced by the hospital in connection with the hearing''
about the field trip.
   ``Disclosure would be an abuse of governmental power and would
destroy Mr. Hinckley's right to privacy in his medical records as
well as in the materials themselves,'' the court filing said.

   George Bush moved toward uncontested
nomination at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday,
promising that he and newly minted running mate Dan Quayle would
work like a ``couple of pit bulls'' to whip the Democrats this fall.
   Bush confidently made the rounds of the convention city as his
hour of triumph approached. Campaign officials waited backstage for
their cue to release 50,000 balloons from the Superdome ceiling in
celebration.
   ``Bush-Quayle'' buttons sprouted on the lapels of delegates
while the vice president pronounced his 41-year-old political
partner one of the ``rising young stars'' of the GOP. But
qualified, he quickly added, to be ``one heartbeat away'' from the
presidency.
   At a joint, nationally televised news conference, Quayle sought
to fend off a barrage of questions about his youth and background
and struck an aggressive campaign pose. ``There is no compromise on
raising taxes,'' he said. ``...If the party of McGovern, Carter,
Mondale and Dukakis got back in power...I think it would be a
disaster.''
   ``I can't wait to get out there and tell the story about what
America would look like under a George Bush administration,'' he
said.
   Later, Quayle told Indiana Republicans elated over his
selection, ``Boy, do I look forward to going out there and
campaigning against Dukakis and Bentsen.''
   GOP officials said he would get his chance beginning Friday,
with an appearance back home in Indiana with Bush.
   Despite a dozen years in Congress, Quayle seemed like the new
kid on the Republican block _ but the day belonged to Bush.
   He spoke at a breakfast for farmers, met with delegates from
California and then made a brief visit to the Superdome podium
where he will stand to deliver his acceptance speech on Thursday
night. ``We'll do all right. I'll do OK,'' he said of the address
that will launch his come-from-behind quest for the White House.
   The presidential nomination was the main order of business at
the convention's evening session, and there was not the slightest
doubt that it belonged to Bush. He earned it in stunning fashion
during the Republican primary season when he routed the field with
a 14-state primary sweep on Super Tuesday in March.
   Campaign officials tapped Texas Sen. Phil Gramm to place their
man's name in nomination. Penn State football coach Joe Paterno led
a parade of seconding speakers.
   With losing 1984 nominee Walter F. Mondale at his side, Democrat
Michael Dukakis opened a four-day campaign swing in Minnesota with
a jibe at the celebrants in New Orleans. ``While they're partying
on Bourbon Street, we're talking to people on Main Street,''
Dukakis said. ``While they take a trip down Memory Lane, we're
looking to the future.''
   Running mate Lloyd Bentsen disclosed his income over the past
five years averaged $772,181 and he had paid $264,453 in taxes.
Quayle said he would be making a full financial disclosure, and
Bush challenged the Democratic ticketmates to make public their
last 10 income tax returns.
   Bush and Quayle stressed their agreement on fundamental issues
at a news conference. ``We're not going off in two different
directions on policy issues. We aren't going to have to debate each
other,'' Bush said in a jab at Dukakis and Bentsen.
   Behind in the polls, Bush said, ``We're going to tell the truth
and it's going to seem like they've engaged a couple of pit bulls.
... Competence is important but ideology is very important and
we're going to be talking on both.''
   The youthful Quayle said he had been tempered by a dozen years
in Congress, had experience as a young man in Indiana state
government and ``had met a payroll'' at his family's newspaper in
Indiana.
   He made a stab at humor, saying his wife had been asking him
about press reports that he had personal wealth in the millions.
   ``Why do you think I picked him?'' Bush joked.
   But Quayle also snapped at reporters who questioned him about
sensitive subjects.
   ``That has been covered and there's nothing to it,'' he said
when he was asked about Paula Parkinson, the key figure in a
sex-and-influence scandal in 1980.
   Asked why he went into the National Guard in 1969 rather than
joining a service that might have sent him to Vietnam, he said, ``I
have a deep affection for those young men and women who sacrificed
their lives in Vietnqam and for anybody to imply anything
differently is just simply wrong.''
   Bush bristled, as well, when asked about the criticism he's
received since introducing his Mexican-American grandchildren to
President Reagan on Tuesday as ``the little brown ones.''
   ``Those grandchildren are my pride and joy,'' he said. ``And I
find it personally offensive to suggest otherwise. And P.S. _ I
don't want to see those kids hurt. This is family and I'm going to
protect them.''
   One day after Bush hailed the Indiana senator as a man of the
future, campaign chairman James A. Baker III was stressing the
41-year-old lawmaker's experience. He ``has more defense and
foreign policy experience, if I may say so, than the Democratic
ticket combined,'' Baker said on NBC.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said Quayle would help in the uphill
race against the Democrats. ``He's a Midwesterner, he understands
agriculture, he is just 41 years old, he is a pro-life
conservative.''
   But California Gov. George Deukmejian said that while Quayle
wouldn't hurt Bush's chances, he wouldn't help him either in the
state with the largest number of electoral votes.
   Quayle's ascension left other Republicanms pondering their
future.
   Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, who contested Bush for the
presidential nomination and then campaigned to be his ticket mate,
confessed to disappointment. ``I'm not going to get emotional,'' he
said, clearing his throat, as he met with the New York delegation.
``But I was brought up by my parents to believe that all things
work together for the good.''
   Sen. Bob Dole offered his customary quip. ``I think he made an
outstanding choice in Dan Quayle,'' said the man who twice tried
but failed to gain his party's presidential nomination. ``I tried
to call him and he called me the other day. He was shaving. First
time.''

<TEXT>
   Chunks of stone that fell from the
4,500-year-old Sphinx have been returned to their place, and the
statue will undergo emergency restoration at five other weak
points, an official said Wednesday.
   Besides weathering the ravages of desert sands and winds over
the centuries that caused the pieces to fall from the right
shoulder of the half-man, half-lion, the statue also has been
victim of a ``bad restoration project,'' which had further worsened
its condition, said Zahi Hawass, director general of the Pyramids
area.
   ``The Sphinx is like a suffering old man who needs an
operation,'' Hawass said of the world-reknowned statue, which lies
near the three famed Giza pyramids on Cairo's western outskirts.
   ``There are five weak points where stones can fall off any
minute,'' Hawass said. The worst problems, he added, stem from a
rising water table and a restoration project that ended just last
year.
   Hawass, who was appointed to his post in 1987, estimated the
repair cost at $10 million.
   Since the Sphinx was built of limestone around a large rock
about 2,500 B.C., it has alternated between being buried under the
sand or subjected to restoration projects that were begun by
ancient Egyptian pharoahs.
   About 3,000 years ago, Tuthmosis IV saw in a dream a suffering
Sphinx buried under the sand, which promised him rule of Egypt if
he cleaned up the area. Tuthmosis had the sand covering the statue
removed and soon afterward he became pharoah.
   Restoration work on the statue also was done during the
Greco-Roman era 16 centuries ago, and by enthusiastic foreign
Egyptologists in the early 20th century. Officials of the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization pitched in between 1982 and 1987.
   Close-up, the proud-looking statue is a patchwork of the results
of the various restoration operations. The Greco-Roman and early
20th century attempts involved giving the vulnerable parts of the
statue a second protective skin of limestone.
   The restoration that ended last year included giving the Sphinx
a 10-inch thick coat of limestones, using cement and gypsum to
stick them together.
   It is this last operation that Hawass and other Egyptologists
have attacked, saying the cement and gypsum did not allow the
limestone to breath. Another problem, they said, was a rising water
table that caused salts to weaken the limestone structure.
   ``It was a very bad restoration project,'' said Hawass. ``We
have to remove this layer, but when we tried that, we found that it
will hurt the original body of the Sphinx. So now we do not know
what to do.''
   He said that Egyptologists and scientists were trying to develop
a chemical mixture to serve as mortar to hold the stones together
while allowing them to breathe.
   Hawass stressed that no damaging cement or gypsum were used in
Tuesday's restoration. The stones will be held in place with a wall
of dovetailed pieces of limestone.

   An Israeli-linked Christian militia on
Wednesday threatened to organize a boycott of a parliamentary
session to choose a new president because it opposes a
Syrian-backed candidate, sources said.
   The election cannot proceed unless there is a quorum in
Parliament.
   An informed source said at least 25 Christian deputies have
pledged to boycott the session. A quorum of at least 53 members of
the 76-member Parliament must be present for a president to be
elected.
   Warring factions declared a cease-fire as hundreds of soldiers
tightened security around the Parliament building, police said.
   Southeast of Beirut, at least one person was killed during the
night and four were wounded in clashes between Druse and Christian
factions.
   Parliament is to convene in Beirut on Thursday to elect a head
of state to succeed President Amin Gemayel, who completes his
six-year term Sept. 23.
   Members of the Christian Lebanese Forces militia have threatened
to prevent the possible election of former President Suleiman
Franjieh by keeping some members of Parliament from attending the
voting session. Franjieh, a Christian, is backed by Syria.
   ``There will be no quorum ever as long as Franjieh remains a
candidate,'' said a high-level official of the Christian Lebanese
Forces, speaking on condition of anonymity. He pledged that the
militia would use ``all political options to prevent Franjieh's
election,'' but refused to elaborate.
   Police reported at least one death in a pre-dawn battle with
mortars and rockets between Christian and Druse militiamen along
the Kfarshima area southeast of Beirut.
   On Tuesday, five bombs exploded in Syrian-policed west Beirut.
No damage or casualties were reported, said a police spokesman, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The wave of violence erupted a few hours after Franjieh
announced he would run for president.
   A police spokesman said the Progressive Socialist Party of Druse
warlord Walid Jumblatt and the right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces
militia agreed to a cease-fire called by the various militias that
began 3:15 a.m. Wednesday.
   Security sources, who demanded anonymity, said the army and
police ``summoned all personnel to their barracks'' and Syrian
soldiers tightened security throughout Moslem west Beirut, frisking
pedestrians and motorists.
   About 800 Lebanese police officers in armored personnel carriers
were deployed Wednesday around the Parliament building to provide
security for the presidential election.
   The Christian Lebanese Forces on Tuesday declared their
opposition to the candidacy of Franjieh, 78, a personal friend of
Syrian President Hafez Assad.
   Franjieh was president from 1970 to 1976. The civil war, which
has claimed more than 130,000 lives and shattered Lebanon's
economy, broke out in 1975. Franjieh requested Syria's military
intervention in Lebanon in 1976, and there are now 40,000 Syrian
troops in the country.
   Lebanon's right-wing Christian leaders see Franjieh's effort to
seek a new term in office as an attempt by Syria to impose its
control over Lebanon.
   The English-language Syrian Times, based in Damascus, said the
presidential election was a chance to rebuild Lebanon and expel
Israel from the south of the country.
   In Israel, Uri Lubrani, coordinator of government policy on
Lebanon, said the election of a Syrian-controlled president would
plunge Lebanon into ``an ongoing state of turmoil.''
   Lebanon's Parliament was elected to a four-year term in 1972
with 99 members. Twenty-two deputies have died since then and
Gemayel's seat became vacant when he was elected president in 1982,
leaving only 76 surviving parliamentarians.
   The civil war has prevented elections and Parliament has been
extending its mandate since 1976.

   Two judges and a colleague were attacked and
beaten last month while trying to deliver a court order, it was
reported Wednesday.
   One judge was kicked in the stomach and another judge and a
court secretary were beaten with a stick in the attack by workers
at the city bus company in Xiangfan, Hubei province, China's Legal
Daily said.
   The attack began after officials of the bus company refused to
accept a court document charging the company with selling old cars
as new. The report did not say whether it also set penalties
against the company.
   The bus company has a history of obstructing justice, but had
always gone unpunished, the paper said.
   Lu Tianbao, deputy manager of the bus company, threw down the
court document when it was handed to him, and kicked judge Ma
Tingyi in the stomach when Ma tried to give it to him a second
time, the report said.
   Ma, judge Ma Dongshen and court secretary Zhou Daxin were
attacked by a growing crowd, apparently from the bus company, as Ma
tried to tell them regulations on delivering a court order.
   The incident drew more than 1,000 onlookers and ended only with
the arrival of police.
   The daily, known for its exposes of legal injustices, said the
local government and Communist Party committee had begun an
investigation of the incident, but so far no action has been taken
against the assailants.
   In the past decade, China has tried to develop a body of law and
guarantee rights to a fair trial, but there are still frequent
reports of police abuse of power, and of lawyers and other court
officials being harassed during legal proceedings.

   Bush planned to stay in his hotel suite and watch on television
when the Republican National Convention formally delivered him the
party's nomination. He had no opposition. Aides said Barbara Bush
would be in the Superdome, watching the roll call with Indiana Sen.
Dan Quayle, Bush's choice for the vice presidential nomination.
   Bush, seeking to match the warm family images of the Democratic
convention, said he would show off three generations of Bushes when
he accepts the Republican presidential nomination. ``I get my
strength from my family,'' he declared.

<BYLINE>QUAYLE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Quayle, soon to be the Republican vice presidential nominee,
began to tell his story to the nation's voters, but he was
immediately bombarded with questions about his wealth, his military
record and his private life.
   At the first news conference with running mate George Bush,
Quayle denied suggestions he had a sexual relationship with
Washington lobbyist Paula Parkinson in 1980: ``There's nothing to
it.' The Indiana senator angrily dismissed as ``a cheap shot'' any
suggestions that he joined the National Guard in 1969 in order to
avoid going to Vietnam. And Quayle also knocked down reports of a
personal fortune as great as $200 million, pledging to disclose all
his holdings fully.

<BYLINE>SELECTION PROCESS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush made extensive notes on potential running mates on legal
pads and reviewed them closely last weekend before making his final
choice of Quayle, aides said. Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller,
also disclosed for the first time the complete list of 11 also-rans.
   They included Sen. Bob Dole and his wife, former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole; New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu,
California Gov. George Deukmejian, South Carolina Gov. Carroll
Campbell, Gov. Jim Thompson of Illinois, Sens. John Danforth of
Missouri, Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Pete Domenici of New Mexico,
Rep. Jack Kemp, and Attorney General Richard Thornburgh.

<BYLINE>IMAGE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates to the convention say Bush should step out from
President Reagan's shadow and ``come out of the chutes raising
hell'' to capture the White House. Some delegates believe Bush must
sharpen his image to succeed, with the advice ranging from
declaring his independence from President Reagan to using fewer
hand gestures, wearing horn-rimmed glasses and standing straight.
Others prefer that Bush ignore the suggestions and be himself.
   Although Bush cited Quayle's ``strong appeal'' to women in
introducing his choice for a running mate, analysts of the
Republicans' gender gap problem say youthful good looks won't be
enough to attract women's votes. ``It appears like the Republicans
are attempting to woo the women's vote rather than win it,'' said
Jane Danowitz, executive director of the Women's Campaign Fund, the
largest women's political action committee.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>BABY BOOM</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush strategists portray the selection of Quayle as his running
mate as a bold bid for the nation's younger generation, but
analysts warn that as a voting bloc, the baby boom could prove a
bust. The problem is that the nation's roughly 75 million baby
boomers make up too large a segment of the population to fit into
one ideological category, experts said. Generational links do not
necessarily mean shared politics. ``They're such large share of the
American population, they cross all income, occupational and
ideological lines,'' said Democratic pollster Peter Hart.''
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>QUAYLE IMPACT</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   As the initial surprise over the selection of Quayle as Bush's
running mate wore off, questions were raised about just what the
second-term senator brings to the Republican ticket.
   Bush and his aides argue that the 41-year-old Indiana senator,
as a member of the huge post-World War II generation, will be a
beacon toward the future for young American voters. They also say
he will attract votes in the Midwest, hit hard by farm woes. But
Quayle is unknown outside his native state, a blank slate for
voters that the GOP and the Democrats alike will rush to write on.
And that clearly worried Republican leaders.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>FARM VOTE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A string of Republican luminaries from certain nominee Bush on
down ridiculed Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis' farm policies,
the day after ``a son of the Midwest'' was picked for the No. 2
spot on the GOP ticket.
   Bush, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole and Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng took aim at a ``Belgian endive'' comment
that's dogged Dukakis since the early days of the campaign. Dukakis
got in trouble when he suggested that farmers could diversify their
crops, in part by growing Belgian endive. ``I don't think that
Belgian endive is the answer to American agriculture,'' Bush said.

   With the death Wednesday of Ambassador Arnold
L. Raphel, the State Department has lost one of its most seasoned
experts in the tumultuous southwest Asian region.
   Raphel, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, had spent most of his
22-year diplomatic career on the politics of that region before his
death in a plane crash that also claimed the life of Pakistani
President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq and 35 others.
   He was appointed ambassador to Pakistan in January 1987, having
served an earlier tour of duty there as political counselor from
1975-78.
   During the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-81, Raphel was deeply
involved in efforts to secure the captives' release, working as a
special assistant to then-Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance and
Vance's successor, Edmund S. Muskie.
   Present and former colleagues of Raphel, 45, mourned his death.
   Vice President George Bush told a news conference in New Orleans
that Raphel was an ``outstanding ambassador'' and said he knew him
well.
   Also in New Orleans, Secretary of State George Shultz called for
a moment of silence at a luncheon he was attending. He called
Raphel ``a man of immense ability who'd been doing a superb job.''
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said, ``We
mourn the loss of Ambassador Raphel. The United States has lost one
of its best diplomats.''
   Vance said in a statement issued from his office in New York
that he was heartsick over Raphel's death.
   ``He was a superb foreign service officer and a wonderful
friend,'' Vance said. ``Our country and all of us who were
privileged to know him have suffered a great loss.''
   With a mustache, thick eyeglasses and a serious demeanor, Raphel
had a professorial appearance. His dress usually was more casual
than that of his State Department colleagues.
   Few countries are considered more important to the United States
than Pakistan. Reagan's decision to send Raphel there as ambassador
was one reflection of the high esteem in which he was held.
   Pakistan was a conduit for U.S. aid to rebels in neighboring
Afghanistan, and Zia was a favorite among conservatives here for
his willingness to cooperate with American policy.
   Some conservatives, including Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., had
deep reservations about the choice of Raphel to be ambassador to
Pakistan, expressing concern about his commitment to Afghan rebels.
Humphrey worked against Raphel's Senate confirmation last year.
   In Pakistan, Raphel oversaw a U.S. aid program totaling more
than $600 million, the third largest behind Israel and Egypt. The
administration felt Pakistan was entitled to generous treatment
despite concerns it was secretly developing a nuclear capability
and was a source of heroin trafficking to the United States.
   Before his appointment by President Reagan as ambassador to
Pakistan in 1987, Raphel held senior positions in the
political-military affairs bureau and the Middle East bureau of the
State Department.
   He was involved in southwest Asian affairs for more than 20
years, beginning with his assignment to Isfahan, Iran, as a 24-year
old State Department recruit in 1967. Two years later he was
assigned to Tehran.
   Raphel was born on March 16, 1943 in Troy, N.Y., and received
his bachelor of arts degree from Hamilton College in 1964. Before
joining the foreign service, he earned a master's degree from
Syracuse University.
   Raphel was recently married to Nancy Ely, a State Department
official. He had a daughter by a previous marriage.
   In Ventnor, N.J., Wednesday, Raphel's family recalled that he
wanted to be in the foreign service since he was a youngster.
   As a boy, Raphel read books about foreign countries, exploring
ways he could someday visit the exotic locations, said his brother,
Murray Raphel, an Atlantic City businessman and civic leader.
   ``From the time he was 10 years old, Arnold wanted to be in the
State Department,'' Raphel said. ``When he was 12, he wrote a
letter to the secretary of state and asked how he could become a
foreign service officer.
   ``The secretary of state wrote back and said he should go to
college, even suggesting some good schools.''
   The family was concerned about the appointment because of the
volatile political climate in the Middle East, Raphel said.
   ``But Arnie never felt worried,'' he said. ``He felt he was
performing a service for his country. He honestly felt he could do
the job better than anyone else.''

<HEAD>Bush To Do Without Specs, Use TelePrompTer for Acceptance Speech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush rapped a gavel Wednesday,
surveyed the vast expanse of empty seats at the Superdome and put
his eyeglasses in his pocket.
   ``I'd like to do it without my specs,'' the vice president said,
spending a few minutes practicing his delivery from the podium
where he will accept the Republican presidential nomination
Thursday night.
   Bush, who rarely speaks in public without his wire-rimmed
glasses, told onlookers he felt comfortable using the TelePrompTer
without his glasses.
   With the TelePrompTer, a speaker's text is flashed onto two
large panes of see-through glass attached to the rostrum. Bush has
seldom used the device, and aides had expressed some concern over
his ability to use it effectively on Thursday.
   But Bush said, ``I like it. I feel comfortable with it.''
   He made his comments during a 20-minute visit to the cavernous
hall.
   ``Right height,'' he said of the hulking podium.
   Bush spoke playfully into the microphone and announced he was
calling to order a convention session at ``3:45 a.m.''
   ``Call to order, call to order, call to order,'' he repeated,
listening to his own voice reverberating.
   ``Any questions?'' he said, pointing far back into the cavernous
hall at a row of empty seats. ``Yes sir, back there. Do you have a
question? No questions? Thank you. I've just finished answering
questions,'' he said.
   ``This is great,'' he declared.
   Media adviser Roger Ailes said, however, ``We're a little
nervous about the TelePrompTer. He's not used to it.''
   Ailes said Bush also doesn't want to ``over-rehearse'' for the
speech.
   However, speechwriter Peggy Noonan, who wrote much of the
address Bush will deliver, said that Bush was practicing a good
deal, and continuing to fine-tune the speech.
   ``He's writing and practicing, writing and practicing,'' she
said. ``He'll probably do that up until 5 p.m. Thursday.''

<HEAD>GOP Ratings Drop on Second Night</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The viewing audience for the Republican
National Convention dropped Tuesday night, and ABC wound up with
the biggest share.
   ABC's average rating for the night was 6.4 and 13 percent of the
total television audience, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co. NBC,
the first-night winner, had a 6.0 rating and 12 share and CBS had a
5.2 rating and 10 share.
   The combined rating of 17.6 was down from the 19.9 cumulative
rating on Monday night, when President Reagan addressed the
convention.
   The second night was the biggest night for the Democratic
National Convention, which drew a 23.3 rating as Jesse Jackson
spoke.
   For the first two nights, the Democrats' average rating was 20.5
while the GOP has averaged 18.8.
   Each rating point represents 866,000 homes with television; the
share is the portion of all television sets in use during the time
period.

<HEAD>Quayle Gets High Marks From Conservatives, Low From Liberals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Dan Quayle's voting record in the Senate has
earned him the admiration of conservatives and the enmity of
liberals on labor, education and civil rights issues.
   The two-term Indiana senator, tapped by George Bush as his
running mate, is the father of the Job Training Partnership Act,
which replaced the old CETA program and provides training through
the private sector instead of government-paid jobs.
   He led the battle against the plant closing notification bill,
which President Reagan eventually let become law without his
signature, and is currently opposing a bill to raise the minimum
wage from $3.35 to $4.65 an hour.
   On the Senate Armed Services Committee, Quayle has staked out a
hawkish position on defense. But at times he has also favored
smaller Pentagon increases than Reagan wanted and pressed for
military procurement reforms.
   Quayle voted twice this year against the Civil Rights
Restoration Act _ once when it passed the Senate 75-14 on Jan. 28
and again on March 22 when his colleagues overrode Reagan's veto,
73-24.
   He voted for confirmation of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court in
a losing cause this year, but led the successful 1986 fight to win
confirmation of Daniel Manion, a conservative South Bend, Ind.,
lawyer, to an appeals bench.
   The Senate's final approval of Manion came on a 50-49 vote, with
Vice President George Bush breaking the tie. Democrats had charged
Manion was inexperienced and a poor crafter of legal opinions.
   Civil rights groups are still upset with Quayle for voting in
1980 to weaken enforcement powers of the Fair Housing Act. The
amendment Quayle supported failed, 205-204.
   ``From the perspective of civil rights, Dan Quayle is a terrible
choice,'' said Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights.
   On Social Security, during the 1985 fight over a budget freeze
backed by many Senate Republicans, Quayle voted with the majority,
51-47, to kill an amendment by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., to restore full cost-of-living increases.
   The freeze never became law. Quayle voted last year against a
move to trim the Social Security COLA.
   The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare
give Quayle a 38 percent rating for the current session of
Congress. ``That's far down in the pack,'' said Ken Hoagland, the
group's associate director of public affairs. ``It's not a good
senior voting record.''
   He was an early advocate of a tax simplification plan like the
one eventually enacted in 1986. Quayle's 1982 ``SELF'' tax plan _
Simplicity, Efficiency, Low Rates and Fairness _ would have
squeezed deductions and compressed tax rates, with a top rate of 30
percent.
   Quayle supports a Constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion
and has voted consistently against Medicaid funding of abortion.
   He has opposed Democrats' bills currently awaiting Senate votes
to require employers to offer workers a minimum package of health
benefits and to offer parents unpaid leaves upon childbirth or the
sickness of a child or parent.
   And he has voted for tuition tax credits and for voluntary
prayer in public schools.
   Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National Education
Association, said, ``We're disappointed that Bush, who says he
wants to be the education president, didn't choose somebody with a
strong voting record in education.'' The NEA gave Quayle a 15
percent correct voting record over the past seven years _ primarily
because of his votes to cut education spending _ which Futrell said
wasn't ``a passing grade in any classroom in America.''
   Americans for Democratic Action gave Quayle 5 percent on its
scorecard last year, and the AFL-CIO gave him a 20 percent rating.
   Quayle gets much higher marks from conservative groups: 89
percent from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 81 percent from the
American Conservative Union in 1987. A pro-defense group, the
American Security Council, gave him a perfect 100 percent score in
1986.
   He has voted for the Superfund to clean up toxic wastes and the
Clean Air Act, but in 1986 opposed an acid rain bill he said would
impose ``staggering'' costs on the industrial Midwest.
   Quayle was also one of a handful of GOP senators who recently
urged Reagan to veto the $299 billion defense authorization bill.
   Quayle, as chairman of a Labor and Human Resources subcommittee,
worked with Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., to produce the Job
Training and Partnership Act, which replaced the 1973 Comprehensive
Employment Training Act that Reagan wanted to scrap.
   Quayle, in leading the fight against the bill to provide 60
days' notice of plant closings, said it would impose ``a
legislative straitjacket'' on industry'' and ``would impede our
capacity to compete in world markets.''
   But after the provision was cut from an omnibus trade bill that
Reagan vetoed and passed as a separate item, Quayle reportedly
advised the White House to let it become law without Reagan's
signature, rather than lose another veto fight.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's no good news in the National Weather
Service's 30-day forecast for areas suffering drought, high heat or
the threat of forest fires.
   The weather service forecast for mid-August to mid-September,
released Wednesday, said that rainfall will be scarce for the
Dakotas, Nebraska, Iowa and the western Great Lakes area, the
farming heartland already withered by drought.
   The same area, and the Eastern region from North Carolina to
Maine, also are expected to continue to endure higher-than-normal
temperatures.
   Forest fire risk will continue high in the timberlands from
Minnesota west to Washington and south through California, the
weather service said. It warned that the forest fire risk will be
``extreme'' for parts of Wymoning, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada
and California.
   The weather service said that recent rains provided some relief
for parts of the Mississippi Valley, but it warned, ``much more
preciptiation is needed for areas east of the Rockies for moisture
to return to normal levels.''
   Higher than normal rainfall is predicted for the Texas-Louisiana
Gulf Coast and for the Southeast, from Florida to North Carolina,
the weather service said.
   Temperatures are expected to dip to below normal for Washington
and Oregon, but remain at blistering levels for much of California.

<TEXT>
   The head of the National Right to Life
Committee praised the Republican ticket Wednesday and accused
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis of being ``a pro-abortion
zealot.''
   Dr. J.C. Willke, the group's president, hailed Sen. Dan Quayle
of Indiana as ``a consistent supporter of the civil rights of all
Americans, including those in the womb.''
   ``There has never been a clearer choice for president than the
one between George Bush ... and Michael Dukakis, who supports
unrestricted legal abortion and government funding of abortion,''
he said at a news conference.
   He called the Democratic ticket of Dukakis and Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas ``the most pro-abortion ticket of the century.''
   He said Bentsen has voted often in favor of federal funding of
abortion and only once against it in the past 10 years.
   Bentsen says he favors Medicaid funding of abortion only in
cases or rape or incest or to save the mother's life.
   Dukakis has said he personally opposes abortion but believes
women should have the right to decide.
   Willke said that as a Massachusetts state legislator in 1970,
Dukakis introduced a bill to legalize abortion on demand, and later
as governor he vetoed bills containing abortion-funding
restrictions.
   Dukakis is not only pro-choice, ``he is a pro-abortion zealot,''
Willke charged.
   Bush favors a Constitutional amendment to ban abortion, except
in cases of rape or incest or to save the mother's life. He favor's
Medicaid funding only to save the mother's life.
   The Democrats' platform states, ``the right of reproductive
choice should be guaranteed regardless of ability to pay.'' It does
not use the word ``abortion.''
   The GOP platform contains several planks decrying abortion and
committing the party to work against it, including appointment of
judges who ``respect ... the sanctity of innocent human life.''

<TEXT>
   Debra Murphree, who says she posed nude for
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, was sentenced Wednesday to six months in
jail in an unrelated prostitution case.
   Miss Murphree, 28, was arrested Sept. 21, 1987, at a motel in
suburban New Orleans. She pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of
prostitution May 20, three months after she identified herself as
the woman at the center of the Swaggart scandal.
   Swaggart never acknowledged any encounter with Miss Murphree,
but tearfully confessed from the pulpit that he had committed
unspecified sins.
   District Judge Wallace LeBrun said that under the state's
multiple offender law, he was compelled to sentence Miss Murphree
to jail because of three prior convictions in prostitution cases.
   Miss Murphree, who did not speak during the brief hearing, was
put in the custody of deputies immediately to be jailed.
   ``Obviously she committed the crime,'' said defense attorney Tom
Weymann. ``But it's a shock, given the circumstances.'' He said he
would appeal.
   Weymann said Miss Murphree had begun to turn her life around
since the Swaggart incident became public. She had returned to her
hometown of Patoka, Ind., where she was living with her parents and
three children, ages 7, 8, and 10.
   She was making arrangements to return to school to study
interior design, her lawyer said.
   The incident rocked Swaggart's $140 million a year evangelical
empire and cost him his credentials as a minister of the Assemblies
of God when he refused to stop preaching for a year.
   Miss Murphree sold her story about the Swaggart encounter to
Penthouse magazine, accompanied by a series of explicit black and
white photos showing the poses and things she said Swaggart asked
her to do in the motel room.

<HEAD>General Assembly Aproves Funds For Persian Gulf Observers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The General Assembly voted $35.7 million
Wednesday to pay for three months of work by U.N. military
observers who will monitor a truce in the 8-year-old war between
Iran and Iraq.
   The Security Council authorized the observer group to verify the
cease-fire, which is to begin Saturday in the Persian Gulf, for an
initial period of six months. The total cost has been estimated at
$75.6 million.
   Five days after the truce begins, peace talks between the
combatants are scheduled to start in Geneva with Javier Perez de
Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, as mediator.
   The U.S. share of the initial appropriation will be $10.9
million. The assessment formula for peacekeeping operations is
different from that used for the regular U.N. budget, of which the
American share is about 25 percent.
   Members of the 159-nation General Assembly adopted the budget
committee recommendation by consensus, without a formal vote.
   A total of 1,300 personnel from 24 nations will be involved in
monitoring the truce, including 350 unarmed military observers. the
U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group will have headquarters in
both Baghdad and Tehran.
   According to a U.N. report, the operation should cost $75.6 for
six months, with the United States expected to pay about $23
million. The budget committee asked Perez de Cuellar to report back
by Oct. 1 on the first phase and its costs.
   Japan has pledged $10 million to the peacekeeping costs, and
Morocco has said it will donate $2 million.
   The Security Council created the observer group Aug. 9 after
Iran and Iraq agreed to observe the cease-fire under terms of
Resolution 598, which the council passed unanimously on July 20,
1987.
   Maj. Gen. Slavko Jovic of Yugoslavia, chief of the observer
team, arrived in Baghdad Wednesday and met with Iraqi officials.
   He told reporters his organization's job will be difficult, but
``I have great hope that the start of the cease-fire in the war
will bring about peace in this area. I will rely on the goodwill
and cooperation of the two parties.''
   U.N. officials in Baghdad have said three main observer posts
will be established in Iraq and four in Iran, but members of the
team will be stationed all along the 730-mile border war front.
   Included in the observer operation are military support staff,
air and helicopter units and small naval unit to patrol certain
areas in or near the disputed Shatt al-Arab, which forms the
southern frontier between Iran and Iraq.
   Jovic said he would fly to Tehran on Thursday to prepare the
operation from the Iranian side.

   There's no business like show business, and
no one knows it better than the Republican Party. They're
camera-ready, color-coordinated and poised for what is billed as
the world's largest indoor balloon drop.
   One hundred-fifty-thousand of them. They're due Thursday night
after George Bush completes his speech _ five to seven minutes of
reds, whites and blues, freed from their nylon nets by a carefully
orchestrated flick of hands.
   ``Frame that and salute it every morning,'' said an exuberant
Bob Johnson, assistant producer of the convention.
   President Reagan was feted with 20,000 balloons after his speech
Monday night, and another 50,000 hung from the Superdome ceiling to
mark the moment Bush won the nomination.
   The 150,000 after Bush's speech will be ``stagger-released,''
alternating colors dropping from opposite sides of the arena onto
delegates presumably wild with excitement and enthusiasm.
   ``There's an art to what we do,'' said Sam Kinnard, the site
manager for Balloon Art by Treb, a Los Angeles firm that also
claims to hold the record for the largest outdoor drop _ 1.5
million balloons for United Way of Cleveland two years ago.
   ``No one is anywhere near'' the company's outdoor record,
Kinnard boasted. `I think there is a group of Japanese who did
400,000.''
   While the Cleveland extravaganza was seven months in the making,
Kinnard said, the Republican convention was ``almost a last-minute
thing'' _ three weeks of preparation.
   The company brought in 18 Balloon Art members from Philadelphia,
New York and Los Angeles to supervise the drops. The Republican
National Committee has been providing 50 volunteers for each of
three shifts a day to help blow up the balloons.
   One woman in the convention production office said she tried to
entice the city prison to send volunteers. It didn't work; she and
her mother ended up among those enlisted.
   This is the way a balloon drop starts: A compressor feeds air
into nozzles, volunteers insert the balloons onto the nozzles,
inflate them, tie them by hand, then cram them like sausage
stuffing into long nylon nets.
   The balloon sausages are anchored to the ceiling in rows. The
nets are laced so that one tug on a string will release the cargo
and send it drifting downward.
   For Thursday night, Kinnard has devised an elaborate release
scheme. A red sausage on the right side of the Superdome ceiling
will be unlaced, followed by a white one and a blue one. Then a red
sausage on the left side, followed by white and blue. And back to
the right side. Et cetera.
   ``It'll come off in four stages, which will make the release
last anywhere from five to seven minutes,'' Kinnard said.
   The timing will have to be exquisite, but the Balloon Art folks
consider the convention a piece of cake compared to their
record-setting United Way balloon drop in Cleveland.
   ``The night before, we had a hurricane that came through,'' said
Kinnard. ``It was almost a disaster, but we managed to repair the
damage and it went of without a hitch.''

<TEXT>
   Republican senators trying to aid their
colleague Dan Quayle's rise from obscurity threw a tag-team
testimonial in front of reporters Wednesday to praise George Bush's
vice presidential running mate.
   ``We know him well,'' said Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   For those who didn't know Quayle, the senators repeated his
vital statistics: he's young, he's conservative, he's married, he
has kids, he's not ugly.
   ``He's attractive because of his looks, he's attractive because
of his enthusiasm,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
   ``I think Dan Quayle, although he's 41 years of age, he's going
to send a message to the American people that the Republican Party
respects young people who achieve,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
   Oh, yes, he's also rich, but the senators said that should not
hold him back.
   ``Let's not start this business of who's wealthy,'' Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., said after a question on whether Quayle's being a
millionaire will lose votes for the ticket.
   They also didn't like to dwell on his military record. During
the Vietnam War, Quayle served in the National Guard, a strategic
move taken by many during that era to satisfy their military
obligation while minimizing the risk of going into combat.
   ``He didn't carry a sign, he didn't go to Canada, he didn't
shirk his responsibility to the country,'' McCain said in response
to a question. ``I respected those who went into the guard.''
   Senators came and went at the hastily called news conference the
day after Quayle's name popped into the headlines. By the time it
was over, eight of them had stepped to the microphone to say how
much they liked him.
   The others attending the event were Sens. Nancy Kassebaum,
R-Kan.; Ted Stevens, R-Alaska; Alan Simpson, R-Wyo. and Arlen
Specter, R-Pa.

<TEXT>
   Authorities arrested another
suspect in a 1985 rebel attack on two cafes that killed four U.S.
Embassy Marines, two American businessmen and seven Salvadorans,
the military said Wednesday.
   Leftist Salvadoran rebels said Wednesday they will ask President
Oscar Arias of Costa Rica to act as go-between in an effort to
renew peace talks with the U.S.-backed government.
   The military statement identified the man arrested as Juan
Antonio Morales Lucero, 38, also known as ``Ruperto.'' It said he
is believed to belong to one of five rebel groups in the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front.
   In the attack in the capital's Zona Rosa entertainment district
June 19, 1985, guerrillas fired submachine guns at people in
sidewalk cafes. One attacker was killed by the rebels' own gunfire
but the rest escaped.
   Morales Lucero confessed after questioning that he helped
provide cover for the attack. He identified the two gunmen who
fired only by their pseudonyms of ``Ulysses'' and ``William,'' the
Defense Department said.
   According to Morales Lucero, the gunmen fled to a guerrilla
stronghold on the Guazapa volcano, 14 miles north of the capital,
immediately after the attack and were killed several months later
in a gunfight with soldiers, the communique said.
   It did not say when he was arrested or give other details. He
was not listed with San Salvador courts handling the Zona Rosa case.
   Three other men _ Juan Garcia Melendez, Jose Dimas Aguilar and
William Celio Rivas _ are being held for trial, charged with
providing cover to the gunmen.
   A military judge last fall ordered the three released under a
political amnesty the government decreed as part of a Central
American peace plan signed by five regional presidents Aug. 7, 1987.
   After the U.S. Embassy protested, President Jose Napoleon Duarte
revoked the judge's order.
   The Central American peace plan, drawn up by Arias, aims at
negotiating an end to civil strife in El Salvador, Nicaragua and
Guatemala. Arias won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for devising and
negotiating the agreement.
   A rebel statement broadcast by the clandestine Radio Venceremos
said they would seek to establish contact with Arias and ask him to
act as an intermediary in reviving peace talks.
   Several rounds of talks ending in October produced no agreement
on an end to the war, which began in 1979.
   The guerrillas insisted on sharing power in a provisional
government but Duarte wants them to stop fighting and join the
legal opposition.

<HEAD>Bush, Quayle Praised for Foreign Policy Contributions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz heaped
praise on George Bush and Dan Quayle on Wednesday, telling an
audience of foreign diplomats and business leaders the Republican
standard bearers had both made valuable contributions to U.S.
foreign policy.
   Shultz credited Bush with confronting the leaders of political
factions in El Salvador several years ago and telling them they
needed to unite against that country's terrorist death squads.
   ``I still don't know what George Bush said to them,'' Shultz
said. ``But, by God, they did it.''
   He said the vice president had also opened the human rights
dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union in a
meeting with new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the funeral of
his predecessor, Konstantin U. Chernenko.
   Gorbachev challenged Bush to discuss human rights lapses in the
United States, Shultz said, and the vice president told him: ``It's
a deal.''
   The agreement was that the U.S. side would listen to Soviet
criticism as long as the Soviets permitted a thorough discussion of
alleged Soviet human rights failures, Shultz said.
   ``We now have the most far-reaching human rights dialogue with
the Soviet Union that we've ever had,'' Shultz said.
   Shultz also credited Bush with persuading European leaders to
accept the deployment of U.S. medium-range missiles on their
territory, a step he said led to the treaty banning such weapons.
   As for Quayle, Shultz said his tough challenges to that treaty
as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee had improved the
pact.
   ``Senator Quayle gave us a tough time on that treaty in the
Senate and wanted to know everything about it,'' Shultz said. ``He
wouldn't accept our explanations or staff papers. He did his
homework, and ultimately he convinced himself it was a good treaty
and he voted for it.''
   As vice president, Shultz said, Quayle will ``do his homework,
dig in, persevere, look at all the facts until he figures out what
the right thing is to do and then he will do that right thing.''
   Before beginning his speech to the foreign leaders, here to
observe the Republican National Convention, Shultz asked everyone
to stand for a moment of silence to mourn the deaths of President
Mohammad Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan and U.S. Ambassador Arnold L.
Raphel. They were among 37 people killed Wednesday when a Pakistani
military plane exploded upon takeoff.
   Shultz called Zia ``a great fighter for freedom'' and a great
supporter of ``the efforts that have finally brought the departure
of the Soviets from Afghanistan, where they shouldn't have been in
the first place.''
   He called Raphel ``a man of immense ability who was doing a
super job in Pakistan.''
   In speaking about foreign affairs, Shultz said the United States
and its allies ``have a success on our hands.''
   ``By success I mean we are seeing the ideas we have stood for
gaining ground, gaining ascendancy,'' he said.
   Shultz ticked off the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the
``settling down'' of the Iran-Iraq war, movement toward a
settlement in Angola, the strengthening of democratic policies in
the Philippines and South Korea and the development of ``more
constructive and productive'' relations with the Soviet Union.
   ``I could go on and on,'' Shultz said. ``It's really fun to do.''

   Sen. Phil Gramm lauded George Bush as ``the
greatest vice president this nation has ever had'' and said his
Democratic rival would raise taxes, ``wimp America and endanger
peace,'' as he placed Bush's name in nomination for the presidency
Wednesday.
   Gramm, the Texan best known for the budget-cutting plan that
bears his name, described Bush as a certifiable war hero committed
to a strong defense.
   ``He has always made us proud,'' Gramm said in remarks prepared
for delivery.
   Gramm addressed delegates to the Republican National Convention
to formally place Bush's name in nomination, just before the
traditional roll call of states that was delivering Bush his
party's mantle.
   He was being followed by several seconders, including Penn State
football coach Joe Paterno.
   Gramm combined praise for Bush, and for the accomplishments of
the Reagan administration, with a strong denunciation of Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   He said Dukakis broke his promise to voters in his first term as
governor of Massachusetts by raising taxes, and in his second term
increased state spending and brought on Massachusetts's $400
million deficit.
   ``He taxed the poor, taxed the rich, taxed the young, taxed the
old and taxed the middle class,'' Gramm said of Dukakis. ``He taxed
businesses and he taxed families.
   ``Given his record, is there anybody here who doubts that a
President Dukakis would raise our taxes?'' Gramm said.
   He said Dukakis has opposed ``every major new weapons system
that we have deployed.''
   ``Is there anybody here who doubts that a president Dukakis
would cut defense, wimp America and endanger peace?'' he said.
   Gramm's senior colleague from Texas, Lloyd Bentsen, is the
Democratic vice presidential nominee. Gramm was elected to the
Senate after leaving the Democratic Party.
   Gramm referred to the legislation with which is name is
associated, the Gramm-Rudman law that set automatic
deficit-reduction targets, as ``trying to do the lord's work in the
devil's city.''
   He praised the Reagan economic record as creating 17 million new
jobs and leading an economic boom.
   ``But while the world calls our economic rebirth a miracle, the
Democrats call it a disaster,'' Gramm said. ``They long for the
failed policies of the past.''
   Gramm recounted Bush's war record and credited him with coolness
when the airplane he was piloting was shot down in the Pacific
during World War II. He recounted his business experience in Texas,
Bush's adopted state, and government jobs leading up to his
election as vice president.
   ``George Bush is the greatest vice president this nation has
ever had,'' Gramm said.
   ``I am honored to place in nomination the name of a man who has
served America in war and in peace, who has the experience, the
character and the strength to lead this great land,'' he said.
   Delivering seconding speeches were Paterno; Ninfa Laurenzo of
Houston, Texas; Councilwoman Joanne M. Collins of Kansas City, Mo.;
Rep. Robert K. Dornan of California; Elaine L. Chao, chairman of
the Federal Maritime Commission; and Bush's son Jeb Bush of Miami,
and his wife.

   Tens of thousands of people are being
evacuated from homes along the flooding Nile and a government
minister said hordes of locusts may be Sudan's next disaster,
according to news reports Thursday.
   The known death toll from the worst floods in Sudanese history
rose to 91.
   Al-Ahram, a semi-official Egyptian daily newspaper, reported in
its early Thursday edition that people were being evacuated in
Khartoum, its twin city Omdurman across the Nile and villages north
and south of the capital.
   A dispatch from Khartoum in the Egyptian daily Al-Akhbar quoted
Agriculture Minister Fateh el-Teegany as saying locusts in had
increased fivefold in western Sudan in recent days, swarms had
reached the western regions Darfour and Kordofan, and more were on
their way from neighboring Chad and Nigeria.
   He said the locusts would attack what was left of crops in
central Sudan in September and October unless they were stopped.
   In the central Gezira region, which includes Sudan's richest
agricultural lands, tens of thousands of acres planted in cotton,
corn and vegetables were submerged by flood waters and the
conditions helped the locust swarms grow, the minister added.
   Egypt's Middle East News Agency said 140 planeloads of relief
supplies had reached Khartoum since heavy rains Aug. 4-5 caused
floods that left up to 2 million people homeless and caused more
than $200 million in damage.
   The agency report Wednesday said authorities still had great
difficulty distributing tents, food and medicine to flood victims
because many affected areas in central, eastern and northern Sudan
were isolated and whole villages were swept away.
   No complete damage estimate was available, but officials have
said 115,000 homes were destroyed in Khartoum alone. Standing water
in the city has become stagnant and more rain Tuesday made
conditions worse.
   Mahmoud Beshir Gamma, the irrigation minister, was quoted by the
Egyptian agency as saying the large northern towns of Atbara,
el-Damer, Berber and Dongola were threatened with flooding.
   It said 18 Sudanese drowned when their ferry overturned as it
crossed the swollen Er-Rahad river, a tributary of the Blue Nile.
It said three children were killed and dozens of people were hurt
in Omdurman when a house collapsed as a result of the flood.
   Water has begun seeping into houses along the Nile and has
almost completely covered the large island of Tuti between Khartoum
and Omdurman, which normally has 13,000 inhabitants.
   The Blue Nile joins the White Nile at Khartoum to form the Nile
River.
   British cartographers lent to the U.N. relief operation are
working on a contour map of the capital that will help determine at
what height Nile waters would start pouring into the streets.

   Authorities arrested 87 people
Wednesday in a sweep through southern West Virginia, Kentucky and
Ohio following an 18-month investigation into the theft of $1.6
million worth of cars, trucks and heavy equipment.
   Terry Ethridge, assistant agent in charge of the Pittsburgh
division of the FBI, said the investigation netted more than 120
motor vehicles and heavy equipment, some of which was displayed at
a news conference at the Huntington Civic Center.
   Officers also recovered five pounds of cocaine and numerous
automatic weapons, Ethridge said.
   The undercover operation was devised in early 1987, when law
enforcement officials became aware that ``we'd had a significant
theft of property problem in this area,'' he said. Undercover
police simply put out the word that they were in the market to buy
stolen auto parts, vehicles and equipment.
   ``It was relatively easy,'' said Michael Carey, U.S. attorney
for the Southern District of West Virginia.
   The various thefts were not necessarily related to one another,
the two Justice Department officials said.
   ``It would be wrong to assume all these people were part of one
ring,'' Carey said.
   ``The use of the term `ring' is misleading,'' Ethridge added.
``If you're in the plumbing business, you know other plumbers,''
even if you're not in business with them.
   Carey called the operation ``the largest case in the district,
(and) one of the largest in the nation.''
   The thefts had a significant economic impact in the area,
especially when it came to heavy equipment, tractor-trailer rigs
and coal trucks, many of which are owned by independent
owner-operators, he said.
   ``Imagine, if you're a coal truck driver, waking up one morning
and finding your truck gone,'' the prosecutor said. ``That puts you
out of business for a long time.''
   ``We hope this will get the message out to all persons ... that
the next time you sell a stolen car or truck, you might be selling
to a police officer,'' he added.
   On Monday, federal grand juries sitting in Charleston and
Huntington returned a total of 27 indictments charging 69
individuals with 141 counts of violating federal statutes,
including charges of conspiracy, possession and transportation of
stolen motor vehicles in interstate commerce, altering
identification numbers of vehicles, and insurance fraud. In
addition, other individuals charged in the case in federal and
state court bring the total number charged to 87, officials said.
   The arrests went smoothly, Ethridge said, and federal agents and
state and local police brought defendants to the federal
courthouses in Huntington and Charleston.
   More charges and arrests may result as agents ``follow up all
the leads generated by the undercover operation,'' he said.

<HEAD>More Record-Setting Heat In Many Cities; Storms In New York, New
Mexico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Temperatures once again soared to 100 or higher Wednesday in
parts of the mid-Atlantic states and Midwest, while strong
thunderstorms hit New Mexico and western New York state.
   Chicago tied a record for number of days in a year at or above
90 degrees with 46. The record was set in 1955. Beckley, W.Va., had
a reading of 95, an all-time high in the 25 years that records have
been kept.
   The National Weather Service said by midafternoon it had hit 100
in Baltimore; 101 in Washington; 103 in Nashville, Tenn.; and 104
in both Des Moines, Iowa, and Paducah, Ky., all records for the
date.
   During the morning, intense thunderstorms produced locally heavy
rainfall and high wind as in western New York state.
   At Wheatfield, N.Y., thunderstorm winds demolished a garage,
while a large tree limb knocked down a power line at North
Tonawanda. More than half an inch of rain fell in less than 5
minutes during a thunderstorm at Warsaw, N.Y.
   Farther west, a flash flood watch was posted for parts of New
Mexico, where showers and thunderstorms Tuesday night and Wednesday
morning created flooding that forced the closing of at least one
highway and more rain was expected.
   Thunderstorms also were reported in the Colorado Rockies, and
scattered storms were reported in Texas, South Dakota, the lower
Mississippi Valley, the Gulf Coast region and Florida.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ended at 2 p.m. EDT
included 0.96 inch at Deming, N.M.; 0.80 inch at Brownsville,
Texas; 0.30 inch at Texarkana, Texas; and 0.28 inch at Park Falls,
Wis.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 60
degrees at Arcata, Calif., and Durango, Colo., to 110 degrees at
Palm Springs, Calif. Wednesday's morning low was 30 degrees at
Jackson, Wyo.
   The national forecast for Thursday called for showers and
thunderstorms from the middle Mississippi Valley to the Virginia
coast, and from Eastern Texas to southern Florida; early-morning
showers in northern Maine; and late-day thunderstorms in the front
range of the Rockies in Colorado and New Mexico, and in central
Arizona.
   Highs in the 60s and 70s were forecast for the Pacific Northwest
and along the Pacific Coast, as well as the upper Mississippi
Valley, the Great Lakes and a large portion of New York state and
New England; between 95 and 100 degrees from southwestern Texas
across Oklahoma, northern Arkansas, southern Missouri, the
Tennessee Valley, and the southern Atlantic Coast states; between
100 and 115 degrees in the desert Southwest and valleys of
California; and in the 80s and 90s in most of the rest of the
nation.

   The first date between teen-agers Lara
Sontag and Gene Mayo was to celebrate their first meeting 11 years
ago, as poster children for the March of Dimes.
   The reunion of the high school kids, who suffer from spina
bifida, was a memorable one, with a chauffeured limousine, flowers
and a fancy dinner.
   The youngsters have used wheelchairs since childhood, but that
posed little problem Tuesday night.
   The Children's Wish Foundation of Winter Park provided the ride
in a white stretch limousine and the dinner at a top French
restaurants, Le Cordon Bleu. Gene provided a dozen miniature red
roses.
   It was the 16th birthday for Lara, who now lives in Carlisle,
Ind. She was in Orlando visiting relatives and wanted to celebrate
it by getting together with Gene.
   They were cherubic 4-year-olds when they posed, holding hands
and giggling, for publicity photographs for the Florida chapter of
the nationwide organization.
   She's considered him special since then, and they've kept in
touch sporadically.
   ``I proposed to Gene on television'' when they were 4, she said.
``He was shocked, but I don't remember what he said.''
   Spina bifida, a genetic defect that leaves the spinal cord
partly exposed, usually causes paralysis from the waist down.
   ``We're able to cope with it, but we haven't found a cure for
it,'' said Brian Ziegler, executive director of the Orlando March
of Dimes chapter.
   Lara basked in the attention Tuesday, saying she felt like a
movie star.
   Soft-spoken and polite, Gene, 15, is a wheelchair jock. He
placed among the top eight wheelchair racers in the Sunshine
Olympics junior games in Tennessee this year.
   The dark-haired Lara described herself as a bookworm. Gene said
he wasn't much of a reader, but they found plenty to talk about.
   ``This is much, much better than a prom night,'' Lara said.

<HEAD>US Will Assist In Investigation Into Pakistan Crash</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Top 7 grafs new to update.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The United States will assist in Pakistan's
investigation into the mysterious crash Wednesday that claimed the
lives of President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq and American ambassador
Arnold L. Raphel.
   Until the results are known, senior U.S. officials are
withholding any conclusions about the disaster, which Pakistan's
U.N. ambassador said was preceded by an explosion aboard the plane.
   ``There is no confirmation of any foul play, but we are not
taking anything for granted,'' said a U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``We offered to help and that offer was
accepted. An incident like this arouses suspicion.''
   There was no announcement of American participation in the
probe. Publicly, the Reagan administration refused to speculate
about any possibility of foul play.
   While joining Pakistan in mourning Zia's death, the State
Department stressed that it anticipated no slowdown in the flow of
U.S. weapons to Afghan rebels through the South Asian country.
   Nor do U.S. officials expect the loss of the pro-American
strongman to have any noticeable impact on the Soviet army's
orderly withdrawal from Afghanistan which Pakistan helped arrange
last April in Geneva.
   Without announcement, American and Soviet diplomats met quietly
in Washington Wednesday and agreed the pullout should continue, the
U.S. official said.
   Questions remain on Capitol Hill and within the State Department
whether Pakistan is bent on developing a nuclear bomb. For U.S. aid
to continue, President Reagan must certify in October that Pakistan
does not possess an explosive nuclear device.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, has taken the lead in criticizing the
administration for failing to get ``ironclad assurances'' that
Pakistan is not developing the bomb.
   Current U.S. aid totals $611 million, making Pakistan the fourth
largest recipient of U.S. military and economic assistance after
Israel, Egypt and Turkey.
   After the crash of Zia's plane in southern Punjab which also
killed U.S. ambassador Arnold L. Raphel, it also is unclear whether
Pakistan would proceed with elections scheduled for Nov. 16.
   Zia had dismissed his civilian government in May, but did not
call for elections within the 90 days prescribed by the Pakistani
constitution.
   He also barred candidates from running with party labels. Zia
took the position that party-based elections could mislead the
voters.
   Critics said this would focus attention on local issues and work
against Zia's main national opposition, the Pakistan People's
Party. That party is headed by Benazir Bhutto, whose father was
toppled in Zia's coup in 1977 and was later executed.
   In light of Pakistan's help in Afghanistan, the administration
was reluctant to make an issue of Zia's political maneuvers.
   ``We will stress that elections should be free and fair, but it
is not up to the U.S. government to prescribe how they should be
held,'' said one American official who spoke only on condition that
he not be identified.
   The State Department was quick to express both condolences and
U.S. support for Pakistan after the fatal crash.
   ``We have a long history of close and friendly cooperation with
Pakistan,'' department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said. ``At this
moment of extreme trial, I want to reiterate our commitment to
Pakistan and our full support for the acting president and his
government.''
   Pakistan not only funneled U.S. weapons to Afghan rebels in
their fight against Soviet forces in Afghanistan but provided haven
for millions of refugees.
   Some anaylsts considered Zia's actions risky, but the Soviets
did not retaliate. Nor did they menace Pakistan after invading
Afghanistan in December 1979. Mindful of the Soviets' long quest
for a warm-water port, the Carter administration assured the region
of U.S. protection.
   Mrs. Oakley stressed that U.S. aid to the Afghan rebels would
continue. ``There is no reason to have any doubt,'' she said.
   In New Orleans for the Republican National Convention, Secretary
of State George P. Shultz said Zia ``has been a great friend and a
great fighter for freedom,'' as well as a ``supporter of the
efforts that finally brought the departure of the Soviets out of
Afghanistan.''
   Zia's death is ``a great loss to the people of Pakistan,'' said
Shultz, who noted there had been a ``quick and orderly transition''
of government.
   Jeane Kirkpatrick, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations
who also was in New Orleans, reacted to news of the crash with
''shock, just shock.''
   She called Zia ``a very strong person, very important to the
whole geopolitical strategic constellation of the region, very
important to the freedom fighters of Afghanistan.''
   Mrs. Kirkpatrick said Zia's death ``raises the question of
whether Pakistan can continue to as strongly support the mujahedeen
and whether Pakistan can resist the extremes of Islamic
fundamentalism.''
   Through Pakistan, the United States provided Stinger missiles
and other arms to Afghan rebels fighting Soviet forces and the
pro-Soviet government in Afghanistan.
   Last month, Zia stirred alarm in Washington with charges the
Soviets were replenishing their forces despite a commitment to pull
all of them out by next Feb. 15.
   It turned out the information was based on a statement by the
Soviet commander in Kabul, and Pakistan subsequently retracted the
allegation.
   Symobically, Zia, ambassador Raphel and U.S. and Pakistani
generals had flown to the southern Punjab to watch a field
demonstration of the U.S. M-1 tank which Pakistan considered buying
from the United States.
   Pakistan is receiving $260 million in U.S. military aid this
year. It recently struck a deal to lease up to half of 16 U.S. Navy
frigates that are being retired for budgetary reasons.
   State Department officials said they did not know what caused
the crash, which also claimed the life of Brig. Gen. Herbert M.
Wassom, 49, the chief U.S. defense representative in Pakistan.
   Mrs. Oakley said Pakistan authorities were investigating.
   She said the U.S. Air Force was sending a plane to Islamabad to
return the victims' bodies and Raphel's wife, Nancy, to the United
States.

<HEAD>Admiral's Son Remembered For Sense of Mission, Sense Of Humor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Elmo R. Zumwalt III, son of the
admiral who ordered the spraying of Agent Orange in Vietnam and was
exposed to the defoliant himself, was remembered Wednesday as a man
with both a sense of mission and a sense of humor.
   ``It did not take me long to realize Elmo was a very special
person,'' said Bob Barrett, a friend who first met Zumwalt eight
years ago. ``He was full of fun, always the life of the party and
he had a teasing sense of humor that was punctuated with a loud
laugh.''
   A few months ago, the two said goodbye as Zumwalt, 42, was dying
of cancer, Barrett remembered at the memorial service at a funeral
home here.
   ``He looked really sick, and as I was leaving the house, he gave
a big bear hug,'' Barrett said. ``I knew then I would never see him
again. I said: `Elmo, do me a favor. Give me your laugh.' And he
laughed for me. He could laugh and joke even in his tremendous
plight. Let's not be sad. We'll see him again someday.''
   Zumwalt died Saturday after a five-year battle with cancer.
   John Pekkanen, one of the publishers of ``My Father, My Son,''
the book by the Zumwalts, also recalled Zumwalt's sense of humor.
   He said Zumwalt had just undergone a bone marrow transplant and
was drifting in and out of consciousness. When he would awaken,
Pekkanen peppered him with questions.
   Pekkanen left the house for a minute. When he came back,
Zumwalt, who appeared to be asleep, began thrashing around. He was
moaning, ``No more questions, no more questions.'' Then he stopped
moving.
   ``He opened one eye, then he opened the other eye. Then he burst
into laughter. I wasn't the only one struck by the Zumwalt humor,''
Pekkanen said.
   Ten friends spoke at the memorial service, which was attended by
350 to 400 people.
   Zumwalt was exposed to Agent Orange while he was serving in
Vietnam. In 1983, he was diagnosed with cancer. His father, Adm.
Elmo R. Zumwalt, had ordered the spraying of the defoliant, which
contains highly toxic dioxin, to push back the Viet Cong.
   But Zumwalt said he never blamed his father for his illness. And
his father said last week that his son's death would make him work
harder for benefits for the veterans affected by Agent Orange.
   Walter Anderson, editor at Parade magazine, met Zumwalt when the
publication wrote a story about him and his father.
   Anderson said Zumwalt had asked him to address his children,
Elmo Russell Zumwalt IV and Maya, and his wife, Katherine, directly.
   ``To my children, there is a loss of a father, a feeling that `I
lost my dad,''' Anderson said. ``Actually, you have not lost your
father's presence because when you have to decide what to do or
between right and wrong, you think `what would Daddy say.' You
can't argue, you've got to listen to him. And he will influence you
in more ways than you will know.''
   To his wife, Anderson said Zumwalt left the following message:
``As unlikely as it seems right now, there will come a time when
the pain of grieving will be less than the joy of remembering. It
will come.''
   James Caldwell, a longtime family friend and professor emeritus
of history at the University of North Carolina, said: ``Some
inherent quality made Elmo believe he had to be tested to the
limit. That was true of school and it was true of Vietnam. He did
not have to go to Vietnam, but he could not have lived with himself
if he didn't.''

<TEXT>
   An anonymous telephone caller purporting
to speak for Islamic Jihad said Thursday that Church of England
envoy Terry Waite is alive and could be freed soon if Britain
``showed good intentions.''
   There was no way to verify the call, to a Western news agency in
west Beirut, as being authentic.
   No one claimed responsibility for Waite's disappearance after he
left his his west Beirut hotel and vanished on Jan. 20, 1987.
Thursday's phone call was the first indication Waite was with
Islamic Jihad, a Shiite Moslem underground faction loyal to Iran's
revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   ``The British hostage Terry Waite is alive and we might release
him if the government of (Prime Minister Margaret) Thatcher showed
good intentions,'' said the caller, speaking in classical Arabic
with a Lebanese accent.
   Waite disappeared while bound for a rendezvous with the Islamic
Jidah (Islamic holy war) captors of two American hostages _ Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
and educator Thomas Sutherland.
   Waite, 48, was acting as personal envoy for Archbishop of
Canterbury Robert Runcie in trying to secure the release of foreign
hostages.
   Islamic Jihad usually does not telephone statements and
repeatedly warned news media against using any telephoned
statements attributed to it.
   It usually sends written Arabic statements with a picture of one
or more of the hostages it is holding for authentication.
   But last May 4, Islamic Jihad telephoned the
Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon radio to say it was releasing
three French hostages it was holding.
   Less than an hour later, Frenchmen Marcel Fontaine, Marcel
Carton and Jean-Paul Kauffman were freed.
   ``We are not doing it for her (Mrs. Thatcher's) sake, but on the

   The 10-day Ashoura celebrations began last Friday evening,

<HEAD>Memo to Reagan on Iran-Contra Deal Recalled</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS two grafs after 5th graf bgng ``Radzimski's
statements ... '' to update with Radzimski's role in last year's
Iran-Contra investigation</NOTE>

   Prosecutors say a onetime White House employee
recalled seeing a memo detailing diversion of U.S.-Iran arms-sale
profits to Nicaraguan rebels that had been attached to a letter to
President Reagan.
   James R. Radzimski, a former National Security Council aide,
told prosecutors that the memo by former NSC aide Oliver L. North
referred to $12 million in arms-sale proceeds that went to the
Contras, according to a filing in U.S. District Court.
   North's memo to former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter was attached to a letter that Poindexter sent to Reagan,
according to an account of Radzimski's statements to prosecutors.
   Reagan has denied knowing about the diversion and independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has said he found no evidence the
president knew anything about it.
   Radzimski's statements were recounted in a letter Walsh sent to
North's defense lawyers and filed Monday in court. The former White
House aide has also told Congress he didn't know if Reagan ever saw
the memos.
   During last summer's congressional probe of the Iran-Contra
affair, Radzimski's name was dropped from a list of public
witnesses who were to appear at the hearings after investigators
decided that his memory of the affair was faulty.
   He ended up testifying to the House-Senate committee behind
closed doors.
   North, Poindexter and two arms dealers, retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim, are accused of illegally
conspiring to divert arms-sale profits to the rebels.
   Radzimski's recollections about the memo were offered to the
defense as evidence that might help exonerate North of wrongdoing.
Walsh's July 28 letter also includes statements by other witnesses
that North told them that lawyers advised him his activities were
legal.
   North, whose trial was recently postponed until after the
presidential election, could opt to offer these statements as
evidence that he had no intention of violating the law since he
acted under the assumption his activities were considered legal.
   Radzimski described North's memo as similar to one found by
then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III in November 1986 that
revealed the diversion of arms-sale proceeds, according to Walsh's
letter.
   Meese's investigation led to the dismissal of North and
Poindexter's resignation.
   North told Congress last year that he intended for Reagan to see
his memo about the diversion, but Poindexter testified he never
gave it to the president.
   The memo Radzimski ``recalls seeing was two to three pages long
and was written by Oliver North and addressed to John Poindexter.
Attached to the memo was a letter from Poindexter to the
president,'' Walsh wrote in the July 28 letter to North's lawyers.
   Radzimski told the House and Senate committees that investigated
the Iran-Contra affair that he recalled seeing ``two memorandums,
one addressed to Poindexter from Oliver North and a second
memorandum from Poindexter to the president.''
   But he told the panel he couldn't recall whether the memorandum
was delivered to Reagan.

<HEAD>Police: For 10 Days, Youths Hid Friend's Body After Shotgun
Slaying</HEAD>

   Three young brothers panicked after
a teen-age companion was shot while they were fooling with a
shotgun, so they hid the body for 10 days, police say.
   Finally, one of the brothers led police to the decomposing
remains of his 14-year-old friend on Tuesday.
   ``The kids got panicky. They thought he was dead and they took
him over to the apartment next door,'' said police Detective Ralph
Pflieger.
   Preliminary results of an autopsy performed Wednesday revealed
William Dennis Bowen III died of a shotgun wound to the head, said
police spokesman George Pinckney.
   He said tests were still being conducted by the medical
examiner's office to determine, among other things, whether Bowen
died instantly.
   No charges were filed. Detectives questioned the brothers, ages
12, 14 and 15, and tentatively concluded the shooting occurred
accidentally on Aug. 7, Pinckney said. Bowen was reported missing
by his mother on Aug. 8.
   Names of the three brothers were not released because they are
juveniles.
   The 14-year-old who came forward told authorities that he, his
brothers and the victim had been playing with a shotgun they found
in a cousin's apartment. After the gun discharged, the brothers
dragged the victim next door and left him there, Pflieger said.
   The 14-year-old told an adult about the shooting after he was
taken into custody at Pinellas County Juvenile Detention Center
several days ago on a charge related to an auto theft, officials
said.
   ``We're not sure how long the third party (the adult at the
center) knew. That's part of the investigation,'' Pinckney said.

   Barry Bingham Sr., patriarch of a
three-generation media family, was buried in historic Cave Hill
Cemetery Wednesday following a traditional Episcopal service
attended by nearly 700 people.
   Bingham died Monday at the age of 82, less than a year after he
was diagnosed as having a brain tumor, and just five days before
one of his many public gifts _ the 400-foot high, $2.6 million
Louisville Falls Fountain _ was to be dedicated.
   A longtime family friend, Katharine Graham, chairwoman of the
Washington Post Co., was among those attending, as well as a
delegation headed by Allen H. Neuharth, chairman of The Gannett
Co., which purchased the newspapers from the Binghams.
   Others in attendance included former Courier-Journal executive
editor Norman Isaacs, Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., former Govs. Edward
T. Breathitt and John Y. Brown and Louisville Mayor Jerry Abramson.
   At the direction of the Binghams, the service followed the order
for the burial from the Episcopal prayerbook of 1928, said Margaret
Dickinson, the church's music director.
   There were no eulogies and Bingham's name was never uttered
during the music-filled service led by the Rev. E. Benjamin Sanders.
   The downtown church is just a few blocks from The
Courier-Journal and Louisville Times building, the anchor structure
in a block that also contains the broadcast properties and
Standard-Gravure.
   During Bingham's ownership of The Courier-Journal and Louisville
Times, the morning Courier-Journal won eight Pulitzer Prizes and
championed education, mental health, civil rights and humanitarian
causes.
   Until two years ago, he had directed a media empire that also
included WHAS television, two radio stations and Standard Gravure
Corp., a printing company, as well as other smaller companies.
   The family holdings were sold because of changing economic
conditions and disagreements among his children.

<HEAD>Amnesty Says Hundreds Killed, Thousands Missing In Peru</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Peruvians have been killed and
thousands have been tortured or disappeared in provinces where the
military has extraordinary power under a state of emergency,
Amnesty International said Thursday.
   A report by the worldwide human rights organization said the
disappearances and killings by the armed forces increased in the
past two years after declining significantly following President
Alan Garcia's inauguration in July 1985.
   London-based Amnesty said in a statement that it has received
numerous new accounts of abuses since its report was prepared in
May ``which appear to indicate a deterioration in the human rights
situation.''
   Amnesty called on Peru to investigate impartially all the cases
reported and bring those responsible to justice. It said very few
cases had ever been prosecuted.
   The report said deaths and disappearances started in 1983 after
the government introduced special measures to combat the
Maoist-inspired Shining Path guerrilla group, which is trying to
overthrow Peru's elected government.
   Army officers were given military and political control over
designated emergency zones, which Amnesty said enables the armed
forces to sidestep human rights safeguards in Peruvian law.
   The greatest toll of victims has been reported from a remote
mountainous area in Ayacucho department, which was the first
emergency zone established, the report said.
   Human rights groups in Peru estimate 3,200 people have
disappeared since 1982 in Ayacucho alone, it said.
   Amnesty said other zones placed under military command since
Garcia came to power have been the scene of hundreds of other
disappearances and killings.
   ``Today ... over 30 of Peru's more than 170 provinces are within
emergency zones: disappearances and extrajudicial executions
continue to be reported on an almost daily basis in these areas,''
the report said.
   It said most victims were peasants, students, teachers,
community leaders, trade union leaders, lawyers and human rights
workers in emergency zones where guerrilla groups have been most
active.
   Amnesty also condemned killings and tortures by the Shining Path
and other left-wing guerrillas.
   In 1987, Amnesty said it received reports of 201 disappearances,
175 of which remain unresolved. Almost half were in the Ayacucho
emergency zone.
   Amnesty said ``reports persist of civilians being seized and
killed outright by troops or being found dead after being detained,
and of the killing of combatants after surrender.''
   Among 36 possible military-linked killings it cited in 1988, it
said 29 were villagers in Cayara in Ayacucho department who died
during an armed forces counterinsurgency operation May 14.
   Witnesses said five victims were taken by the military to the
local church where they were beaten and hacked to death. Others
were killed as they returned home from tending crops, the report
said.
   Reports of widespread torture included electric shocks, burning,
beatings, sexual abuse, near-drowning and hanging by the arms for
prolonged periods, the report said.

   Two college students released by guerrillas after
being held for 10 months in the Amazon left the U.S. Embassy in
Bogota, Colombia, and were headed home Wednesday, officials said.
   Stephan Koneman, 22, and Jason McLachan, 21, both of Chicago,
were released Sunday by Colombian leftist guerrillas who captured
them Oct. 4.
   Officials at the State Department in Washington, D.C., and at
the U.S. Embassy in Bogota said the two men were on their way home
Wednesday.
   Koneman's mother, Doris Koneman, said Wednesday that she hadn't
heard when her son would return, but was preparing to fly here from
her home in Breckinridge, Colo.
   ``I'll come when I hear, when I know,'' Mrs. Koneman said
Wednesday morning in a telephone interview.
   Tom Rissman, a spokesman for both families, said the two
students were scheduled to arrive in Chicago about 6:30 a.m.
Thursday. He said he had no further details, although the parents
had been notified.
   ``Obviously, they're delighted and can't wait to see their
children,'' said Rissman, a partner in the elder McLachan's law
firm.
   The two young men, both geography majors, were canoeing down the
Amazon last October when they were captured by members of the
Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, a leftist rebel group,
Stephan Koneman told reporters Tuesday in Bogota after their
release was announced.
   Family members had not heard from the two since Koneman's
brother received a letter dated Sept. 22, Mrs. Koneman said.
   ``I'm filled with gratitude, I have a deep sense of the
miraculous and I really look forward to seeing him,'' Mrs. Koneman
said late Tuesday night after hearing her son was alive and well.
   ``The weight of the world is off our shoulders,'' added
Koneman's father Elmer Koneman, who lives in Chicago.
   Koneman said he and McLachan were kept at various jungle camps,
and were given the same food and shelter the guerrillas had.
   ``They always treated us well, although they had their
suspicions about what kind of work we were doing. But talking with
them we wiped out their doubts and they saw that we were
innocent,'' he said.
   Both students, who met at the Latin School in Chicago, were
seniors majoring in geography _ Koneman at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison and McLachan at Columbia University in New York.

   Abortion foes continued their 4-week-old battle
against abortion clinics Wednesday, with 78 more activists arrested
during two demonstrations.
   Police spokesman Cal Jackson said 32 protesters were arrested at
Midtown Hospital and 46 were arrested at the Feminist Women's
Health Center, both scenes of earlier demonstrations. Police said
those arrested would be charged with misdemeanors, mostly
obstructing the road and sidewalks.
   The arrests raised to 671 the total number arrested in the
series of demonstrations, which began July 19. The protests are
being orchestrated by the New York-based anti-abortion group
Operation Rescue.
   Many of those arrested in earlier protests have remained in jail
while refusing to give their names, saying they were calling
themselves ``Baby Jane Doe'' or ``Baby John Doe'' in solidarity
with aborted fetuses. Operation Rescue has promised to pack local
jails with protesters to bring national attention to its cause.
   Mayor Andrew Young said Wednesday that 44 U.S. representatives
had written him urging that he ask law enforcement authorities to
free the ``Baby Doe'' protesters. But Young refused the Congress
members' request, saying the prisoners could be released if they
reveal their identities.
   ``I don't think I'm required in any way to be involved in these
demonstrations,'' Young said.
   He pointed out that the city is spending $10,000 a week in
overtime pay to police officers assigned to the protests. Jail
costs in Atlanta city jails run an extra $42 per day per prisoner,
and $50 per day in Fulton County.
   Those signing the letter, made public by Young, included onetime
presidential candidate Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., and the entire
Louisiana delegation to the U.S. House. The letter was written by
Rep. Clyde C. Holloway, R-La. Many of the protesters have come from
Louisiana.

President</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Criminal charges won't be sought
against the former president of Westfield State College, who
resigned last month amid a trustees' investigation into his alleged
use of school trust funds for personal expenses.
   Hampden County District Attorney Matthew J. Ryan said Wednesday
he made the decision not to prosecute the former official, Irving
H. Buchen, after reviewing the trustees' report.
   ``I don't think a criminal proceeding at this particular time,
which would be a long drawn out process before a grand jury, would
be of any value to the Commonwealth or Westfield State College,''
he said.
   He said investigators found ``a great deal of slipshod record
keeping'' and ``use of poor judgment.'' But, pointing to the broad
discretionary powers college presidents enjoy in the use of trust
funds, he said it would be very difficult to establish criminal
intent beyond a reasonable doubt.
   Ryan called on the Legislature to tighten controls over the use
of college trust funds. Current statutes give college presidents
sole authority to use trust fund money for any item they feel will
benefit the institution.
   John St. Clair, chairman of the Westfield State College
trustees, declined to release the trustees report, but said it has
been submitted to a legislative subcommittee investigating the use
of college trust funds. He also said trustees were tightening their
own policies.
   Buchen, 57, resigned on July 27 after having headed the college
for 15 months. He succeeded Francis J. Pilecki, who left amid
charges of sexual misconduct with male students, and a furor over
the payment of $10,000 out of trust funds to one of the students.
   The trustees launched their three-week investigation in July
after the Union-News of Springfield had reported that Buchen billed
college trust funds for $3,400 in expenses by submitting allegedly
inaccurate or questionable vouchers for travel and dinners.
   The newspaper said its review of the bills showed that Buchen
had been reimbursed for vacation expenses in Florida, his wife's
travel and dinners with non-existant faculty members. He also
billed the college for dinners in California and Florida with other
college presidents and a trustee, who maintained they had not eaten
with him.
   He later paid back $1,259.

   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
has been confined to his home because a decline in his white blood
cell count makes him vulnerable to disease, a government official
said Wednesday.
   The decline in the number of white blood cells, which fight
infection, results from chemotherapy treatment Duarte has received
for liver cancer, Eduardo Colindres, the presidential press
secretary, said.
   Colindres spoke at news conference called to deny rumors that
Duarte was in a coma.
   According to the three physicians attending Duarte, ``his
general condition is good and stable and his spirit is more than
satisfactory,'' Colindres said.
   ``His health is not as delicate as is being speculated and he is
expected to resume his presidential duties next week,'' he said.
   The medical report said the decline in white blood cells is ``a
secondary effect that appears normally between the 10th and 15th
day after the application of chemotherapy,'' Colindres said.
   Duarte received his second chemotherapy treatment the first week
of August at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C. He
returned to El Salvador Aug. 10.
   Colindres said a physician from Walter Reed was expected to come
to El Salvador to examine Duarte. The visit already had been
planned in anticipation of the effects of the chemotherapy, he said.
   Duarte is ``being protected with broad-spectrum antibiotics,''
he said.
   Doctors at Walter Reed removed part of Duarte's stomach in June,
when he received his first chemotherapy treatment. He returned home
in mid-July, then flew back to the United States for the second
treatment.
   The president's Salvadoran doctors say he has advanced liver
cancer and have given him six to 18 months more to live.

<TEXT>
   Actress Valerie Harper said she's thrilled to
be having her day in court against her former employers, Lorimar
and NBC-TV, as trial of their multimillion-dollar suits and
countersuits opened Wednesday.
   The bitter dispute over the TV series ``Valerie'' began about a
year ago and came to trial faster than most cases because of an
unusual ``rent-a-judge'' program.
   All parties agreed to share costs of about $15,000 a week to
hire retired Superior Court Judge William Hogoboom and a staff of
court personnel to handle the case. The hearing is expected to last
five weeks.
   If they had waited for a regular court assignment in the
backlogged Los Angeles system, it could have taken five years to
bring the matter before a jury.
   ``I'm very glad to finally have my day in court,'' Miss Harper
told reporters. ``And it's wonderful to have it settled in a very
timely fashion. ... I'm just happy that I'm here in court. It's
thrilling.''
   Miss Harper was fired from ``Valerie'' last summer after a
heated dispute with Lorimar and the show's producers. They claimed
she threw tantrums and was difficult to work with. She claimed they
fired her without reason.
   Also at issue was a dispute over Miss Harper's request for an
increase in her $56,750-per-episode salary.
   Miss Harper and her husband, Tony Cacciotti, who was
co-executive producer of the series, sued Lorimar as well as NBC,
which carries the show, and two producers for $180 million,
alleging she was wrongfully fired. Cacciotti also was ousted from
the show.
   The defendants countersued Miss Harper, the Emmy-winning
comedian of the ``Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and ``Rhoda'' before she
launched ``Valerie, for $70 million, alleging breach of contract on
her part.
   A portion of the original case, which centered on the use of the
name ``Valerie'' in the show's title, was resolved when the name of
the show was changed recently to ``The Hogans.''
   In the opening round of jury selection, Hogoboom told
prospective jurors they would be seeing some famous faces in the
courtroom.
   In addition to Miss Harper, he said, witnesses are expected to
include two current stars of the show, Justin Bateman and Sandy
Duncan. Comedian Carol Burnett also was listed as a potential
witness.
   Merv Adelson, chairman of Lorimar, and the show's executive
producers, Robert Boyett and Thomas Miller, also were named as
witnesses along with Brandon Tartikoff, head of NBC's entertainment
division. They are defendants in Miss Harper's suit.

   President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq and
U.S. Ambassador Arnold L. Raphel were killed Wednesday in an
explosion that destroyed their aircraft shortly after takeoff from
a remote airport.
   Among the 35 others aboard were Brig. Gen. Herbert M. Wassom,
chief U.S. defense representative to Pakistan, and several
Pakistani army generals. All were reported killed.
   Unofficial reports and rumors circulated that the Pakistan air
force C-130 was sabotaged, hit by an anti-aircraft missile or a
helicopter or was shot down by India, whose border was just 80
miles away.
   Zia was a close U.S. ally and ruled Pakistan for 11 years,
longest of anyone in the nation's 41-year history. In accordance
with the constitution, he was succeeded by Senate chairman Ghulam
Ishaq Khan, who declared a state of emergency and 10 days of
national mourning.
   ``The plane was engulfed in a big ball of fire ... somersaulted
and tumbled to the ground,'' said Azhar Imam Zaidi, a government
spokesman in Bahawalpur, where the crash occurred. He said wreckage
was strewn on a sandy plain about six miles from the city's
civilian airport.
   A U.S. official in Washington, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press that the United States will
assist in Pakistan's investigation of the crash.
   ``There is no confirmation of any foul play, but we are not
taking anything for granted,'' he said. ``We offered to help and
that offer was accepted. An incident like this arouses suspicion.''
   No announcement was made of the U.S. participation and publicly
the Reagan administration refused to speculate about any
possibility of foul play.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Zia and Raphel
had flown to Bahawalpur, 330 miles south of Islamabad, for a field
test of the U.S.-made M-1 tank, which Pakistan was considering
buying.
   Pakistan's official radio said the American-built transport
plane had just taken off when it exploded about 4:30 p.m. (7:30
a.m. EDT).
   At the United Nations in New York, Pakistani Ambassador S. Shah
Nawaz said Zia ``lost his life today in an airplane crash which
followed an explosion on board shortly after takeoff.''
   He told The Associated Press later: ``The C-130 is a very sturdy
plane. I have never heard of one exploding like this.''
   When asked it another aircraft might have collided with it, he
declared: ``No, no, no. When the president flies, no other planes
fly'' in the area.
   Neither Pakistani nor U.S. sources could confirm any of the
reports about what caused the crash. Ishaq Khan said sabotage could
not be ruled out, but officials refused further comment.
   Pakistan was created from Moslem-dominated areas of India when
the subcontinent became independent of Britain in 1947 and the two
countries have fought three wars. East Pakistan became the nation
of Bangladesh after a 1971 civil war in which India sided with the
secessionists.
   India and Pakistan each have tens of thousands of troops posted
along the 1,836-mile border and a U.N. frontier observer force has
been stationed since 1949 in the disputed Kashmir-Jammu region.
   Rajiv Gandhi, India's prime minister, said in New Delhi he was
``deeply shocked and distressed'' by the death of Zia, 64, and sent
condolences to the president's family.
   Ishaq Khan, Pakistan's acting president, met with the Cabinet
and armed forces chiefs.
   ``The nation will face the present hour of trial with unity,
fortitude and courage and will emerge more united and stronger from
the ordeal,'' he said in a midnight address to the nation.
   He said general elections scheduled for Nov. 16 would be held as
planned.
   Cities were reported to be calm and there was little immediate
reaction from Zia's political opponents. Official radio and
television broadcast prayers and readings from the Koran, the
Moslem holy book.
   There were no immediate reports of unusual military activity in
Pakistan after the president's death was announced.
   Zia, then army chief of staff, seized power in a bloodless coup
in 1977 and ruled under martial law until December 1985. He began
sharing power with a civilian government in early 1986, but
dismissed it last May 29 on grounds it failed to maintain law and
order and enact Islamic law.
   After the coup, Zia had the Cabinet arrested and sent ousted
Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to trial for conspiracy to
murder a political opponent, who was not killed. Bhutto was hanged
in 1979 and his daughter, Benazir, later became Zia's main
political foe.
   ``Life and death is in the hands of God,'' she told The
Associated Press on Wednesday. `We will not say anything.''
   She said passing the mantle to the Senate chairman was ``a
positive development'' and added: ``Whatever should have been done
has been done. We are sure the changeover will be as smooth as
possible.''
   Zia supported guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed communi the Soviet
troop
withdrawal began May 15 the Kremlin has accused Pakistan of
continuing to funnel arms to the insurgents.
   In recent months, he faced an unprecedented challenge from the
increasingly unified political opposition led by Ms. Bhutto.
   Raphel, 45, was a native of Troy, N.Y and appointed ambassador
in January 1987 by President Reagan.
   It was his second assignment to Pakistan, where he served there
from 1975 to 1978 as political officer in the U.S. Embassy. Raphel
played a key role in negotiations to end the U.S. hostage crisis in
Iran in 1981.
   Vice President George Bush said at a news conference in New
Orleans, site of the Repblican Party convention, that Pakistan and
the United States ``have a very special relationship and the loss
of Gen. Zia is a great tragedy.''
   He called Raphel ``an outstanding ambassador.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said in New Orleans that Zia
``has been a great friend and a great fighter for freedom,'' as
well as a ``supporter of the efforts that finally brought the
departure of the Soviets out of Afghanistan.''
   Salam Hamid, secretary-general of the Pakistan League of
America, said in New York, ``We strongly feel it (the plane
explosion) was a sabotage.'' It was a military plane, he explained,
and ``usually military planes are totally unscheduled.''

   Here are excerpts from the prepared text of
the speech by Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas nominating Vice President
George Bush for president at the Republican National Convention
Wednesday night.
   ... Do you remember what the world was like in January of 1981
when Ronald Reagan and George Bush took the oath of office?
   The amnesia merchants of the Atlanta convention want us to
forget that when the Democrats left the White House, inflation and
interest rates were at the highest levels in American history. ...
   Given his record, is there anybody here who doubts that a
President Dukakis would raise our taxes?
   Is there anybody here who doubts that a President Dukakis would
spend our workers into poverty? Is there anybody here who doubts
that a President Dukakis would cut defense, and wimp America and
endanger peace?
   Is there anybody here who doubts that a President Dukakis would
expand the power of government and its control over our businesses,
our families, our churches, and our lives. ...
   We will never have to worry about George Bush's willingness to
stand up for America.
   He knows from real life experience that peace comes through
strength, not through wishful thinking. ...
   ... George Bush was the youngest pilot in the Navy. ... On a
bombing run at Chichi Jima, his plane was hit and both of his
crewmen were killed. As flames swept over the wings and cockpit,
George Bush remembered the first obligation of a leader is to
accomplish the mission.
   He stayed on his bombing run and dropped two tons of TNT on the
target. He then turned his crippled plane out to sea and bailed
out. ... With blood streaming down his face and a .38 revolver in
one hand, he paddled away from the shore with the other hand to be
rescued by a submarine.
   Let me read from his citation for the Distinguished Flying Cross.
   ``By his superb airmanship, courageous actions, and loyal
dedication to duty, Lieutenant Bush reflected great credit upon
himself and upheld the highest traditions of the United States
Naval Service,'' signed, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
   My friends, when Michael Dukakis vetoed that bill providing for
the Pledge of Allegiance to the American flag in Massachusetts in
public schools he was not representing the views of George Bush. ...
   ... George Bush is the greatest vice president this nation has
ever had. He has always made us proud.
   When the Soviet Union targeted a new class of nuclear weapons at
Western Europe, destroying the military balance and threatening
peace, Vice President Bush flew to Europe to meet with our NATO
allies. ...
   As chairman of the South Florida Task Force, George Bush put
together the nation's first really successful effort to protect our
children from illegal drugs. ... George Bush knows that the only
way you can deal with drug pushers is to grab them by the throat.
...
   ... With George Bush as our president, building on the success
of the last eight years, there is no limit to the future of the
American people. ...

   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett
said Wednesday night that Democratic leaders are embarrassed by
efforts to teach schoolchildren values and the pledge of allegiance.
   Bennett, in a brief address to the Republican National
Convention, said the Reagan administration has sparked controversy
by calling for teaching school children moral values and the
Judeo-Christian tradition.
   But ``there are some fights worth having,'' added Bennett, who
leaves his post next month.
   Bennett, the only Democrat in the Reagan Cabinet until he
switched to the GOP two years ago, said, ``the Democratic elites
regard much of American history as a mistake to be corrected, not a
legacy to be extended.''
   ``The sanctity of human life, moral standards, personal and
institutional responsibility _ even the pledge of allegiance _ too
often these are the subject of denigration or embarrassment among
leaders of the Democratic party,'' said Bennett.
   He charged that Democrats ``have lost confidence in our
principles and they have lost the will to defend our principles, at
home and abroad.''
   He said Ronald Reagan and George Bush have ``helped advance the
educational goals of the American people'' by pushing ``standards,
discipline, choice, accountability and the teaching of right and
wrong.''
   Bennett said, ``The American people expect our children to leave
school as better people _ better intellectually and better morally.
And they are right to expect this.''
   ``In reaffirming our beliefs, Republicans have looked to our
founders, to the Declaration, to the Constitution, and to our
history. And following Lincoln, we have sought guidance from our
Judeo-Christian tradition,'' he said. ``We have done this, we have
been criticized for doing this, and we shall continue to do this.''
   Reagan recently named Lauro Cavazos, president of Texas Tech
University, as Bennett's successor. If confirmed by the Senate,
Cavazos would be the first Hispanic Cabinet member in U.S. history.

<TEXT>
   A high-speed passenger train en route to Moscow
from Leningrad derailed in a swamp and caught fire, killing at
least 22 people and injuring more than 100, the state-controlled
media said Wednesday.
   Soviet officials blamed the crash of the Aurora train Tuesday
evening on dispatchers in the town of Bologoye, 180 miles northwest
of Moscow, near the midpoint of the route between the Soviet
Union's two largest cities.
   They said dispatchers failed to alert the engineers that a speed
limit of 40 mph had been imposed a day earlier on a section of bad
track, the official Tass news agency said. The train was traveling
90 mph when it slid off the rails and crashed, Tass said.
   ``The fast express train jumped the rails ... and a blaze
immediately broke out in it. Diesel fuel in the restaurant car,
which poured out of full fuel cans for the stoves, caught fire.
Flames spread to the other cars,'' Tass said, quoting an
unidentified Railway Ministry spokesman.
   Tass reported that 22 people had been killed and 107 were
hospitalized. The fatalities included children, the newspaper
Izvestia said without elaborating.
   Trains on the Moscow-Leningrad route typically operated at
capacity.
   The TV news program ``Vremya'' said a rail inspection team had
determined Monday there was bad track near the town of Belogoye,
and ordered trains be instructed to slow to 40 mph. But rail
dispatchers in Belogoye did not inform engineers and the Aurora
sped onto the bad track at full speed, the newscast said.
   Anatoly N. Sobin, director of the Leningrad railroad station in
Moscow, the train's destination, said the train was carrying 760
passengers when it crashed about 190 miles north of the capital.
   He told The Associated Press that 95 of the injured were
hospitalized in Bologoye and Vyshny Volochok, the towns near the
accident site.
   Sobin said he did not know the exact death toll from the crash,
but said it was not as deadly as a June 4 explosion aboard a
freight train in the city of Arzamas, 240 miles east of Moscow.
That blast killed nearly 100 people, wounded 200, and forced the
evacuation of 700 families.
   Tass said the Moscow-bound train left the tracks between the
Berezaika and Poplavenets stations at 6:34 p.m. Tuesday. Izvestia
said 15 cars derailed.
   Izvestia said firefighting equipment could not approach the
burning cars fast enough because they derailed in swampland. It
also reported that the first railway water tanker sent to the scene
turned out to be empty.
   Residents of nearby villages, soldiers and civilian emergency
workers went to the scene to treat the injured, Izvestia said.
   Traffic on the Moscow-Leningrad route was restored by Wednesday
morning, and an investigation team headed by a deputy chairman of
the Council of Ministers, Vladimir Gusev, was set up, Tass said.
   Disaster reports by Soviet media still are slow in appearing and
often lacking in important details. But the accounts Wednesday of
the fatal train derailment less than 24 hours earlier reflect the
closer watch Soviet media have been keeping on public matters under
Communist Party chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
greater openness on subjects affecting the population.

<HEAD>Democratic National Committee Gearing Up For Run Against Wallop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SARAH GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state lawmaker seeking to unseat U.S.
Sen. Malcolm Wallop got a boost to his war chest Wedneday from the
Democratic National Committee, but the incumbent still packs a far
greater punch.
   State Sen. John Vinich handily defeated two opponents in
Tuesday's Democratic primary, and Wallop faced only token
opposition on the GOP side.
   With the primary out of the way, Vinich settled down to woo
voters in the heavily Republican state away from Wallop, whom the
Democrats say has lost touch with his constituents in his 12 years
in Congress.
   That task was made a little easier by the Democratic National
Committee's grant of about $16,000, with hopes of more aid coming.
   ``We always felt that it (Wyoming) had the potential of being a
strong opportunity state,'' said DNC Communications Director Anita
Dunn. ``It was an impressive victory done the old-fashioned way _
Vinich clearly earned it. It was a hard campaign, a good campaign
with a very populist message.''
   While the race between Vinich, state schools Superintendent Lynn
Simons and University of Wyoming law professor Pete Maxfield
appeared tight going into Tuesday's election, the state senator
from Fremont County pulled away to a decisive victory.
   Unofficial returns showed Vinich with 23,165 votes, or 47
percent, while Maxfield collected 14,595, for 30 percent, and
Simons finished with 11,312 votes, or 23 percent.
   Although Vinich closed the primary race with $40,000 in debts,
his immediate cash flow problems for the general campaign will be
eased a little by the DNC contribution.
   Federal law allows the committee to give candidates $17,500 in
cash contributions, plus more in in-kind contributions based on
state populations. In Wyoming's case, Vinich could get as much as
another $109,000, according to Dunn.
   In-kind funds may be used in conjunction with campaign
expenditures on such items as polls, advertising and mailings,
according to Dunn. The DNC also may provide the campaign with
technical assistance.
   Dunn said Vinich would not begin receiving the in-kind funds
until some time after the DNC's senatorial committee meets early
next month.
   Panel members will decide then whether to give Vinich any or all
of the in-kind funds, based on how successful they feel he can be
against Wallop, Dunn said.
   Vinich will not get quite all the $17,500 in cash because the
committee had already given him about $1,000 for the primary race,
the same amount that went to Maxfield and Simons.
   Wallop's pocketbook is said to total more than $500,000, and in
Tuesday's voting, Wallop polled more votes than the three Democrats
combined _ 55,696, or 83 percent of the GOP vote.
   Vinich acknowledged that he has a tough battle ahead of him.
   ``We'll be working right along. It's an awesome task and I don't
think we can let up now,'' he said. ``We're on the downhill
stretch.''

   A man who took three hostages at a
county courthouse surrendered peacefully to authorities Wednesday,
ending a 23-hour standoff during which he released his captives but
reported his wife killed herself.
   Kevin Patrick Firth, 30, was taken into custody at 9:15 a.m.,
police Sgt. Greg Kuhn said. He had reported four hours earlier that
his wife, Helen, had committed suicide.
   Authorities were uncertain, pending an autopsy, whether the
woman had killed herself or was shot to death by her husband, Mesa
County District Attorney Steve ErkenBrack said.
   The standoff began Tuesday morning when Firth's wife slipped him
a gun, and the two took three hostages just prior to the jailed
Firth's hearing on sexual assault charges. A jailer was sprayed in
the face with Mace during the apparent escape attempt, authorities
said.
   Mrs. Firth said she had smuggled explosives into the courthouse,
according to police. During the standoff, Firth threatened to blow
up the two-story building.
   A bomb squad searched the courthouse after Firth was taken into
custody, but no explosives were found, authorities said.
   ErkenBrack said hostages had reported seeing wire, tape and
round objects inside the courthouse. ``There apparently was
something there to make the hostages believe there were
explosives,'' he said.
   The hostages, court clerks Joyce Bailey and Sheila Shumway and
receptionist Linda Romersberger, were released one at a time, the
last walking out about 2 a.m. Wednesday.
   Shumway, the first to be set free, said Firth made the hostages
lie on the floor in a judge's chambers.
   ``We huddled together for two hours, holding hands and
praying,'' she said.
   Shumway said she was more frightened of Mrs. Firth than of Firth
himself. ``She was aggressive, and nervous and mad,'' she said
during a news conference by the three hostages Wednesday. ``He was
relatively calm, but I was only there for two hours.''
   Shumway said she thought Firth meant to kill her when he told
her she was going home.
   ``He told us not to cry and I said: `I'm sorry. I'm scared.' And
he said, `You get up. You're going home.' I thought he meant he was
going to kill me.
   ``Those 10 steps to the door, to the landing, was the longest
walk of my life.''
   Authorities said Firth appeared willing to give himself up about
3:30 a.m., but his wife balked and threatened many times to
detonate explosives.
   At 5:10 a.m., Firth used a police radio he had taken to report
that his wife had shot herself. When negotiators tried to calm him
down, he said:, ``I can't. I've got to be with her. It's too late.''
   Police said they believe the incident began as an abortive
escape attempt. But Firth made no demands, except to talk with
investigtors about the sexual assault case pending against him,
authorities said.
   Firth, a Delta auto mechanic, was released from prison in
October after serving time on a rape conviction.
   He was arrested again on March 8 and charged with first-degree
sexual assault and kidnapping in the Feb. 24 attack on a grocery
store employee.
   ErkenBrack said Firth faces possible charges including taking of
hostages, kidnapping, a felon in possession of a weapon and being a
habitual criminal.

   Dan Quayle, soon to be the Republican vice
presidential nominee, began to tell his story to the nation's
voters Wednesday, but he was immediately bombarded with questions
about his wealth, his military record and his private life.
   At the first news conference with running mate George Bush,
Quayle denied suggestions he had a sexual relationship with
Washington lobbyist Paula Parkinson on a 1980 Florida trip with
other congressmen: ``There's nothing to it.''
   ``I went down and I played golf and I came home and anybody that
knows me, knows that's exactly what I did,'' Quayle said in a
combative interview on the Cable News Network.
   The Indiana senator angrily dismissed as ``a cheap shot'' any
suggestions that he joined the National Guard in 1969 in order to
avoid going to Vietnam.
   And Quayle also knocked down reports of a personal fortune as
great as $200 million, pledging to disclose all his holdings fully.
   On his first full day as the Republican Party's new rising star,
Quayle held the joint news conference with Bush and traveled with
him to talk to the California delegation.
   With his wife Marilyn, the nominee-to-be greeted their three
children _ Tucker, 14; Benjamin, 11; and Corinne, 9 _ after they
arrived here on a chartered flight from Washington.
   Quayle also got a thunderous ovation from the Indiana
delegation, making an appearance that was scrapped Tuesday so Bush
could introduce him at a rally as his choice for the vice
presidential slot.
   ``Boy, do I look forward to going out there and campaigning
against Dukakis and Bentsen,'' Quayle told the cheering Hoosiers.
   Quayle denounced suggestions that his looks _ he has been
compared with actor Robert Redford _ would influence women to vote
for him, calling the suggestion ``sexist.''
   ``That is an insult to women,'' Quayle told CNN. ``I think it's
absolute nonsense. It is demeaning to women.''
   Quayle sat with Barbara Bush, the vice president's wife, in the
Superdome Wednesday night to witness the presidential nomination
roll call.
   The news conference was a tough one for Quayle as he faced a
series of sensitive questions.
   Foremost among those was the issue of his relationship _ if any
_ with Parkinson.
   In 1981, news reports said Quayle was one of three congressmen
who traveled to Florida on a golfing trip with the Washington
lobbyist. Quayle denied having sexual relations with her at the
time. Asked about his relationship with Parkinson, his answer was
terse: ``That has been covered and there's nothing to it.''
   Asked whether he had seen her on any other occasion, Quayle
simply said ``No.''
   Later in a CBS News interview, Quayle said the matter would not
be a campaign problem.
   ``There's nothing there. It's not going to be a problem,'' he
said.
   Later, Bush aide Robert Teeter said that the Parkinson matter
had been investigated in detail by Washington lawyer Robert
Kimmitt, who handled the probes of potential candidates for Bush.
   ``Kimmitt looked into it very carefully and gave the vice
president absolute assurance there was nothing there,'' Teeter said.
   He added that Bush and Quayle had discussed potential questions
before the news conference, including the Parkinson query.
   The 41-year-old politician also defended his qualifications to
be vice president or president, touting his knowledge of foreign
policy and defense matters.
   ``I know perhaps as much about national security as anybody,
with few exceptions,'' he said. ``The Senate Armed Services
Committee and my national security background gives me a very
important background for if some accident would befall the
president to have an understanding about what needs to be done to
preserve the freedoms and the opportunities in this country. I feel
prepared.''
   Quayle's claim of expertise brought up the issue of his military
service. Quayle joined the National Guard after graduating from
school in 1969, thereby avoiding the possibility he would be
drafted and sent to Vietnam.
   He bristled at any criticism of his choice.
   ``I do perceive that as being a cheap shot. I have a deep
affection for those men and women that have sacrificed their lives
in Vietnam. And anybody _ to imply anything differently is just
simply wrong,'' Quayle said.
   Asked whether his lack of a combat record would be a handicap
compared to Bush's distinguished war record, Quayle said it would
not.
   Teeter said Quayle had been asked as part of the selection
process whether he had used any family influence to get into the
National Guard _ which was flooded with applicants during the time
of Vietnam and the draft. Quayle denied invoking any such influence.
   Quayle, heir to a family trust that owns several newspapers,
denied he was very wealthy.
   When asked if he was worth $200 million, Quayle did not get a
chance to answer immediately. Instead, Bush stepped forward to
joke: ``Why do you think I chose him?''
   Then the Indianian tried a light answer to the question:
   ``That figure is not correct. Believe me, you have caused me a
lot of problems at home because my wife is asking about that.''
   Quayle said that, in any case, he would disclose his finances
fully, as will Bush.
   The Indiana senator also explained that he had executive
experience, listing several executive positions in state government
before going to Congress, including one as the chief inheritance
tax officer for the state.
   ``I was known as the chief grave robber of the state,'' he said.

<HEAD>Police Find Little Protest Work at Republican Convention</HEAD>

   The Republican National Convention is so
short on protests that police officers working 12-hour shifts have
been left chatting among themselves in the sweltering heat.
   The New Orleans police, accustomed to the raucous Mardi Gras
celebrations, have found that the staid Republicans are an easier
crowd to control. A small number of demonstrations also have kept
arrests to a minimum _ 12 as of Wednesday and none in the
designated protest site of Lafayette Park.
   ``It's not as intense,'' said Lt. R.A. Paisant, who is
supervising a handful of officers at the park.
   On a rainy afternoon Wednesday, about 50 police officers ringed
the free speech stage as 20 well-dressed young people heckled a
half-dozen ``Skinheads'' who were using their scheduled 90 minutes
to blame blacks, Jews and Hispanics for all of the world's troubles.
   Earlier, an AIDs awareness group, Act Up, got heckled by
college-aged young people identifying themselves as Young
Republicans.
   Police ringed the stage for that, too, although nobody in the
park seemed tempted to do anything but shout insults back and
forth. About 100 people, apparently office workers on their way
home, stood around under the live oaks and magnolia trees watching.
   A young man who had been heckling the Skinheads refused to step
back when officers said he got too close to their line. He was
arrested _ the first person taken into custody at a demonstration
in the park _ but his identity was not immediately available.
   Afterwards, a phalanx of 25 officers, including four on
horseback, surrounded the six Skinheads and hustled them two blocks
safely to their cars.
   Police are on 12-hour shifts during the convention, as they are
during the two-week Carnival season leading up to Mardi Gras. But
the resemblance ends there.
   ``No. 1, the convention's only four or five days. So you don't
have everyone on 12-hour shifts for 10 or 12 days. You have the
time cut in half,'' Paisant said.
   Also, most convention events are during the day, while Mardi
Gras parades and parties are held at night and on weekends.
   But the biggest difference is the size of the convention crowds,
which are smaller and more spread out than at Mardi Gras, when one
million people jam the parade routes and fill the French Quarter.
   While most of the estimated 30,000 people are in the Superdome
when the convention is in session, the rest of the time the
delegates and delegate-watchers are spread out with many attending
the more than 500 parties scheduled during the week.
   When they do party, out-of-town Republicans don't seem to get as
rowdy as New Orleans residents, especially not Mardi Gras revelers.
   ``They're not as hard drinking,'' Paisant said.
   Moreover, neither convention-related events, such as a rally for
Vice President George Bush held Tuesday, nor the demonstrations
have drawn large numbers of local residents.
   A lot of idle time appears to make for irritable police officers.
   About 10 plainclothes officers became frustrated on Monday night
when a group of about 20 demonstrators marched toward the Superdome
and ended their protest on a lightly-traveled back street near the
arena.
   While there, they handed out leaflets denouncing Bush to the few
Republicans who passed by headed for the Superdome, and taunted the
officers for watching them so closely.
   The officers remained stone-faced, arms folded, in the
late-afternoon heat.
   When a reporter asked an officer what he made of the situation,
he snapped ``No comment,'' the standard reply from most officers on
the convention beat.
   The busiest officers appear to be those directing traffic near
the Superdome.
   A motorist who falls short of making it through a yellow light
will get at least a glare and a growl from an officer if the car
juts into the intersection.
   And woe to the motorist who stops to let someone out at Poydras
and Loyola streets, the busiest intersection in the city these
days. Such a transgression could warrant a tongue-lashing.
   One officer was asked to comment on the oppressively hot job.
``No comment,'' he snapped.

   As the initial surprise over Dan Quayle's
selection as George Bush's running mate wore off Wednesday,
questions were raised about just what this second-term senator
brings to the Republican ticket.
   ``Politically, I don't know what he brings to the party,'' said
Richard Bernstein, a delegate from Westchester County, New York.
``I'm not sure I understand the dynamics of it.''
   In particular, questions have been raised about whether Quayle
is up to the job of vice president _ or president.
   ``His reputation as a lightweight is overstated,'' said Norman
Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the conservative American
Enterprise Institute in Washington. ``When Quayle applies himself,
he can do quite well. ... He doesn't apply himself much.''
   Bush and his aides argue that the 41-year-old Indiana senator,
as a member of the huge post-World War II generation, will be a
beacon toward the future for young American voters. They also say
he will attract votes in the Midwest, hit hard by farm woes.
   The conservative senator is an attractive, energetic campaigner
who is comfortable with television and the new campaign
technologies of the 1980s, they add.
   But Quayle is unknown outside his native state, a blank slate
for voters that the GOP and the Democrats alike will rush to write
on.
   And that clearly worried Republican leaders.
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel told Arizona delegates on
Wednesday to stop telling reporters they know little about Quayle
``because anything negative will be reported and anything positive
will not be.''
   But most delegates were willing to speak their minds.
   ``It was a surprise to me,'' E. Leroy Owens, a GOP district
leader from Manhattan, said of the Quayle selection. ``But I hope
he does not have any skeletons in his closet.''
   Quayle faced questioning about potential skeletons at a joint
news conference with Bush on Wednesday.
   Quayle said there was nothing to speculation that he'd had a
sexual relationship with Washington lobbyist Paula Parkinson on a
golfing trip to Florida with two other congressmen in 1980. He said
suggestions he had ducked service in Vietnam with National Guard
duty were a ``cheap shot.'' And he said stories putting his net
worth at $200 million were just wrong.
   But the hardest, and most important, question Quayle must
answer, with word and action, is whether he is qualified to assume
the presidency.
   ``I don't think he's the right man for the job,'' said Jack
Dunlop, a delegate from Auburn, Ala. ``I don't think the people of
Alabama will support him. He's too young and too inexperienced.''
   Dunlop's choice for the No. 2 spot was former United Nations
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick.
   The Democrats made it clear they would draw telling comparisons
of Quayle's qualifications and those of their vice presidential
candidate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas. A joke already making the
rounds Wednesday cracked that the Bush-Quayle ticket could be
called ``Bush Lite.''
   ``Nobody ever asked any questions about whether Lloyd Bentsen
was qualified to be president of the United States,'' Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis said Wednesday at a campaign
stop in Virginia, Minn.
   Ornstein, who has studied Congress for many years, said Quayle
``has potential, but it's just potential. ... I would not describe
Dan Quayle as a mature 41-year-old.'' Ornstein said he would rank
Quayle only at the midpoint of all senators, ``in any dimension of
quality you want.''
   Beyond the question of his qualifications, Quayle also comes
under opposition fire as the darling of the GOP's far right, as
represented by Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire. Earlier this
week, Humphrey threatened that conservatives would sit on their
hands this fall if Bush did not choose a true conservative.
   ``It just showed that Bush picked somebody from Humphrey's short
list,'' Washington Democratic Chairwoman Karen Marchioro said in
Seattle. ``If (Bush) can't stand up to Gordon Humphrey, God only
knows what he'd do with the Ruskies.''
   Even one of Quayle's assets, his youthful good looks, is turning
into something of a liability.
   Several Republicans were quoted as saying Quayle's handsomeness
would attract female voters, who prefer Dukakis over Bush by large
margins in several surveys.
   ``That's sexist. It's ridiculous,'' Nancy Neuman, president of
the League of Women Voters, said in an interview Wednesday.
   Quayle agreed with that description of the idea.
   ``Women ought to resent the suggestion that they would vote for
somebody on looks,'' Quayle said in an interview on Cable News
Network. ``That is an insult to women. ... I think it's absolute
nonsense. It is demeaning to women.''
   In addition, Quayle's stance against abortion and the proposed
Equal Rights Amendment drew heavy fire from some women's groups.
   ``With the nomination of Dan Quayle for vice president, George
Bush has essentially written off the women's vote,'' said Kate
Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League. ``Quayle has an extraordinary anti-women record in
his tenure in the Senate.''

   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr said Tuesday night the
Republicans ``took on the tough issues and didn't flinch'' in their
platform, and she urged skeptics to compare the GOP and Democratic
platforms side-by-side.
   Orr, the platform chairwoman, told Republican delegates the
40,000-word document they approved earlier in the day was ``far,
far superior to the platform the Democrats cobbled together in
Atlanta.''
   ``The difference is simple: Republicans share their vision with
the American people. Democrats hide from the people,'' Mrs. Orr
said.
   ``The Democrats wanted to hide their views from the American
people, because they knew that if the people ever found out what
they really believed, they would lose,'' she said. ``They don't
want the people to know that they are still the party that will
raise taxes and weaken our defense.''
   Holding up a side-by-side comparison of the platforms prepared
by her party, she urged the delegates and television viewers to
write the Republican National Committee in Washington to ask for a
copy, ``or you can write your local newspaper and ask them to print
it.''
   Earlier, Orr told reporters the Republicans don't yet know how
much it would cost to implement all the proposals in the GOP
platform, but they are working on an estimate. Orr has claimed the
Democrats' platform would cost taxpayers $43 billion next year
alone.
   The first-term Nebraska chief executive said, ``We took on the
tough issues and didn't flinch.''
   ``Our platform presents a vision of America that is optimistic,
bold and daring. ... The Democrats missed their chance to level
with the American people. We didn't,'' she said.
   She recalled George Bush's recent slap at Michael Dukakis as
``the stealth candidate'' and said, ``the Democrats' platform
proves it.''
   ``You won't find some very basic words in the Democratic
platform _ words like `tax' or `revenue' or `unemployment.' You
won't find any mention of NATO. You won't find the words `church'
or `synagogue,''' she said.
   ``We say loud and clear what Vice President Bush has said so
many times: we won't raise taxes, period,'' she said.
   She singled out planks in the GOP platform favoring a child care
tax credit, college savings bonds, an end to ocean dumping and
mandatory sentences for drug dealers.
   ``On issue after issue, the contrast is clear: Democrats say
nothing, or else they cloak their views in empty rhetoric. But
Republicans tell the American people exactly what we stand for and
exactly where we will lead this country,'' she said.
   Orr ended her speech by saying that despite the ``tough and
painful times'' farmers have endured recently, ``Republicans are
optimistic about the future of American agriculture.''
   She said the party rejects ``the Democrats' idea of mandatory
production controls,'' but wants to open markets abroad and ``find
new uses for farm products.''
   ``As governor of a farm state, I know that the future of
American farming will be secure with George Bush as president,''
she said. ``Michael Dukakis knows so little about agriculture that
he told the farmers of Iowa that they ought to try growing Belgian
endive.''

   Israel expelled four Arabs Wednesday and
ordered 25 more deported, the military said. Israel Television
reported that a 9-year-old Palestinian girl was killed when
soldiers put down a West Bank riot.
   Hospital officials said Israeli troops beat 105 Arabs in the
occupied Gaza Strip, where a curfew was imposed for three days in a
row, and soldiers barred West Bank Palestinians from entering
Jerusalem during a daylong protest strike.
   Early Thursday the army lifted the curfew in the main Gaza Strip
cities, but curfews remained in effect in several of the coastal
strip's refugee camps.
   Eight West Bank villages also were under round-the-clock
curfews, but the orders did not prevent scattered protests in which
nine Palestinians were wounded. Israeli radio reported six wounded
in the Nablus area of the occupied West Bank, and the army said
three were wounded in the Gaza Strip.
   In the West Bank town of Jenin, 9-year-old Rasha Artawi was
killed while troops dispersed a riot, Israel Television said. It
quoted Arab reports as saying the girl was killed by a stray bullet.
   However, army officials told the television that a local doctor
said the girl was killed by a stone. An army spokesman reached by
The Associated Press said he had no information about the case.
   The fatality brought to 248 the number of Palestinians killed in
the 8-month-old uprising. Four Israelis also have been killed.
   The four deportees allegedly were members of outlawed
Palestinian guerrilla groups and incited the Arab uprising, the
army said.
   They were flown by helicopter to Lebanon, given $50 each and
released, military sources said. They were identified as Mohammed
Gharableh, Ahmed abu Muailek, Yusri Darwish al Hums and Fathi
Ibrihim Shakaki, all from the Gaza Strip.
   The United States has protested Israel's policy of deportations,
but Israel defends the measure as the most effective means of
deterring violence. Since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising, 33
Palestinians have been deported.
   The army also handed deportation orders to 15 more Arabs from
the West Bank and 10 from Gaza, accusing them in a statement of
``leading the uprising ... and taking direction from terrorist
organizations.''
   The statement said the 25 Arabs belonged to local Palestinian
committees that intended to fill a power gap left by King Hussein's
decision to disengage Jordan from the West Bank.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin warned Wednesday that Israel
would crack down on the local committees with ``whatever force we
are allowed by law.''
   ``I wish we could end violence by spreading flowers. I wish we
could end it by sitting around the table sipping coffee. But I
believe these are not practical options,'' Rabin said.
   Tensions remained high following a riot Tuesday at a prison for
Palestinians in which army troops killed two Arabs.
   ``I have never seen anything like it in my life,'' an Israeli
officer who witnessed the riot in Ketziot near the Egyptian border
told the daily Haaretz. ``Nearly 1,000 prisoners, as though on
order, started rioting in Block No. 1 ... throwing stones and
climbing the walls.''
   The inmates also threw tent poles and pieces of cots at prison
guards, Israel state-run radio in Arabic reported.
   Another senior official described prison conditions as crowded
and tense. ``The place is a time bomb,'' he told Haaretz. Neither
was identified by name, in keeping with army regulations.
   The prison, which houses about 2,500 inmates in tents circled by
barbed wire, was opened in March to hold Arabs jailed for
participating in the rebellion against Israeli rule.
   Military officials disagreed on the cause of the riot, with some
saying it appeared triggered by news reaching Ketziot of an
indefinite curfew imposed on Gaza. Others said the inmates began
protesting when they saw visiting Red Cross representatives.
   In Geneva, Red Cross spokeswoman Francoise Deron confirmed
representatives visited the prison Tuesday but told the AP the
riots occurred in a section the delegates did not tour. She
declined to comment on conditions in the prison.
   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, the Gaza Strip commander, visited
the prison Wednesday and appointed a committee to investigate the
riot.
   A copy of a letter written by inmates and smuggled out of
Ketziot complained of ``brutal conditions'' and called on
authorities to close the prison immediately.
   The letter was not specific about conditions but said the
inmates were beginning a hunger strike. ``Yes to the pangs of
hunger, no to surrender,'' it said.
   In Gaza, Shifa Hospital officials said 105 Palestinians were
treated for beating injuries, mostly bruises, said Dr. Ahmed
Yazeji, Shifa's chief surgeon.
   He said the injuries appeared caused by beatings with ``clubs
and rifle butts and kicking with heavy military boots.''
   He added that 90 percent of the victims said they were beaten in
their homes by troops searching for suspected stone-throwers.
   An army official said he could not confirm the beating injuries.

   Yellowstone National Park officials on Wednesday reopened a
14-mile stretch of road closed earlier this week by a 66,500-acre
fire, while 700 firefighters watched over a small Montana town
threatened by three large fires.
   Fire crews contained a 2,650-acre fire in eastern Oregon; cool,
damp weather eased the fire danger in critically dry forests in
western Oregon.
   In west-central Idaho, Nez Perce National Forest officials
offered a $5,000 reward for information about an apparent arson
responsible for a 2,175-acre fire, according to Mary Zabinski, Nez
Perce information officer. The blaze was brought under control
Wednesday.
   Firefighters in northern Utah on Wednesday gained control over a
600-acre fire, authorities said.
   All roads and entrances in Yellowstone National Park in
northwestern Wyoming were open Wednesday but were subject to
closing depending on wind conditions, officials said.
   The road from the park's west entrance to Old Faithful Geyser
was opened Tuesday afternoon, park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo said. A
14-mile stretch of road inside the park was opened later Tuesday,
but closed at night to give firefighters a chance to clear scorched
trees that threatened to fall on the road, she said. The two roads
were closed earlier this week by the large North Fork fire.
   Fires in the park now cover more than 260,000 acres, officials
said; a flight over the Clover-Mist fire on Tuesday showed it had
grown to about 109,000 acres, according to park spokeswoman Amy
Vanderbilt. Two park campgrounds are closed, she said.
   In Lame Deer, Mont., a 3,300-acre fire to the north was declared
controlled Tuesday night and fire lines were completed around a
10,000-acre fire south of town and a 780-acre fire to the
northwest, fire information officer Jerry Chapman said Wednesday.
   About 850 firefighters have worked at keeping the three fires
from damaging buildings at the community of 600 people on the
Northern Cheyenne Reservation.
   The fires, Chapman said, were still dangerous. ``We're not
calling them contained. ... We're saying the line isn't totally
secure,'' he said.
   Wind-blown embers continue to ignite numerous spot fires during
the day, said another fire information officer, Ron Smith. ``The
winds are so bad, this fire had actually spotted ahead of itself by
half a mile,'' he said.
   In the Elkhorn Mountains about 10 miles southeast of Helena,
officials closed public access to 58,000 acres where a week-old
fire continued to burn in steep, heavily timbered terrain.
   Hot temperatures, low humidity and afternoon winds sent the
flames churning Wednesday to the northeast along the east slopes of
the Elkhorns.
   Fire information officer Bob Krepps said the flames were within
1{ miles of some homes on the outskirts of Winston, a farming
community, and that the Broadwater County sheriff's office was
alerting residents, though no evacuations were ordered.
   Motorists jammed U.S. Highway 12 east of Helena to watch the
spectacular sight Wednesday evening.
   ``It looks like Coney Island out there on the highway,'' Krepps
said. ``There's lots of people pulling off and watching this thing
burning.''

   More temperature records fell Wednesday as the Heat Wave of '88
kept its grip on a wide area from the Carolinas to the upper
Midwest.
   ``It's miserable,'' said photographer Chuck Novara of
Murphysboro, Ill. ``We have a window fan. You wake up, you sweat.''
   The temperature hit 104 in Baltimore, 101 in Washington and in
Louisville, Ky.; 103 in Nashville, Tenn.; and 104 in both Des
Moines, Iowa, and Paducah, Ky., all records for the date, the
National Weather Service said.
   Beckley, W.Va., broke its all-time temperature record when it
reached 96 degrees, but it's a town where official weather records
date back only 25 years. The old high was 94 degrees, which was
reached two times last month.
   The Tennessee Valley Authority, having already set back-to-back
summer power usage records Monday and Tuesday, issued an urgent
appeal Wednesday for customers to conserve.
   But despite the request, power usage climbed again, setting
another TVA summertime record.
   The federally owned utility has never been forced to reduce
electricity to residential customers, but ``if electrical usage is
not reduced sufficiently, some areas may experience an interruption
of service,'' said Robert C. Steffy Jr., senior vice president of
power. TVA serves about 8 million people in Tennessee and parts of
six other states.
   Among the other cities for which high-temperature records were
set or tied were Cleveland, where it hit 99; Columbus, Ohio, 97;
Detroit, Mich., 97; Indianapolis, 99; Madison, Wis., 102;
Milwaukee, 100; Norfolk, Va., 98; Philadelphia, 94; Pittsburgh,
100; Raleigh, N.C., 98; and Richmond, Va., 99.
   In the usually breezy mountains of North Carolina, the
temperature at the Grandfather Mountain tourist attraction sizzled
up to 80 degrees for the first time in five years. One man said it
was time to ``take those sweaters off.''
   ``Most homes don't have air conditioning,'' said Katherine
Morton, a spokesman for the attraction. ``I have a fan going in my
office right now. I don't know what the creative people who don't
have to work are doing, but I imagine some people are finding a
cold stream.''
   Another tourist attraction was affected by the heat in Boston.
The famed Minuteman statue, the 113-year-old tribute to New
England's revolutionaries, has begun dripping a black substance
from its musket, making it look like the statue was melting.
   But experts believe that a resin applied in 1975 to make a
plaster casting of the monument seeped into the statue and is now
being liquefied by heat and humidity, said Ed McManus, a National
Park Service conservator in Boston.
   At the Illinois State Fair in Springfield, officials reported
the scorching heat was reducing attendance and killing at least
seven birds and two sheep on display.
   And in Chicago, Animal Control Director Peter Poholik urged the
city's three main horse carriage companies, operating along the
lakefront, to suspend all daytime service while temperatures remain
above 90 degrees.
   Members of the Poughkeepsie, N.Y., town council had a
tongue-in-cheek way of fighting the heat: They unanimously declared
it illegal for anyone to record a temperature above 89{ degrees.
   Since the resolution was approved Monday night, the thermometer
in the Hudson Valley college town has behaved, with Wednesday's
midafternoon high a chilly 84 degrees.
   Paradoxically, scientists said this week, the same overall
weather pattern that is creating record temperatures is contributed
to unusually cold water at East Coast beaches this summer.
   Southwesterly winds are pushing warm surface water away from the
shoreline, and the surface water is being replaced by colder water
from the oceanic depths.
   ``It's nothing new, but it's usually not noticeable on the
Eastern seaboard,'' said James A. Eberwine, a National Weather
Service forecaster in Atlantic City, N.J.
   ``On the July 4 weekend, we had water temperatures in the 50s.
We had to put out an alert notice for hypothermia. People just
can't believe it.''
   Satellite photographs show unusually cold water extending from
just south of Long Island all the way down to Virginia Beach, said
Dorothy Kropp, a weather service meteorologist in Camp Springs, Md.

   Penn State University football coach Joe
Paterno said Wednesday that George Bush had expressed regrets to
him about a controversy dogging the coach's speech at the
Republican National Convention.
   Paterno has drawn criticism from Pennsylvania's Democratic
governor for agreeing to deliver a brief address on Wednesday
seconding Bush's presidential nomination.
   Bush telephoned Paterno last week and said, ``Gee, I hope I
didn't get you into a mess up there,'' the coach told reporters.
   Paterno, 61, admitted he had second thoughts about giving one of
the seven speeches on behalf of Bush's nomination, but decided to
go forward because of his admiration for the vice president.
   In his speech, Paterno said, ``I know a lot of you are wondering
what an Italian-American football coach from Brooklyn is doing
here. So am I. But, after 40 years of trying to help young men and
women reach their potential as human beings, I'm here as an
educator.''
   Recalling the spirited defense of Bush from former President
Gerald R. Ford earlier this week, Paterno shouted, ``I'll be damned
if I'll sit still while people who can't carry George Bush's shoes
ridicule him.''
   Pennsylvania Gov. Robert Casey has said it was ``probably not a
good thing for the university'' for Paterno to make the televised
appearance at the political convention.
   Seth Williams, Penn State's student government president, said,
``It's wrong for an academic institution to actually involve itself
in partisan politics.''
   Asked before his two-minute speech whether he had any second
thoughts, Paterno replied, ``To be frank with you, a little bit
after the flak came out. And then I said, that's ridiculous because
I really want to do it. Let me put it this way _ because I have
that kind of respect for Bush.''
   Paterno worked on behalf of Bush's presidential primary campaign
in the state and said he knew the vice president through mutual
friends.
   Paterno said that, if asked, he would even appear in a campaign
commercial for Bush.
   The coach's speech marked his return to the Superdome, where his
football team has won one Sugar Bowl game and lost two. Paterno won
his first national championship at the arena by beating Georgia in
1982.
   Paterno dismissed suggestions that his speech could serve as a
springboard into politics, saying he liked to participate in
campaigns but has no personal political ambitions.
   ``I have not prepared for that. I have not sat down and tried to
figure how you get legislation passed and figure out politics, in
the best sense of the word,'' Paterno said. ``I'm always hoping
there is somebody out there like a George Bush who has dedicated
himself for a job.''

   Sen. Phil Gramm, nominating George Bush for
the presidency, said Wednesday he ``has the experience, the
character and the strength to lead this great land'' and declared
that opponent Michael Dukakis would ``wimp America and endanger
peace.''
   Gramm, a Texan best known for the budget-cutting plan that bears
his name, described Bush as a certified war hero committed to a
strong defense.
   ``He has always made us proud,'' Gramm said.
   Gramm addressed delegates to the Republican National Convention,
who began a long flag-waving demonstration on the floor of the
Louisiana Superdome after he formally placed Bush's name in
nomination.
   A cascade of rainbow-colored balloons floated from the stadium's
giant domed ceiling as delegates celebrated in anticipation of the
traditional roll call of states that would deliver Bush his party's
mantle.
   Gramm was followed by several seconders, including Penn State
football coach Joe Paterno, and an unannounced seconding speech by
87-year-old actress Helen Hayes.
   ``I'm here,'' Paterno said, ``because ... I'll be damned if I'll
sit still while people who can't carry George Bush's shoes ridicule
him.''
   Gramm combined praise for Bush, and for the accomplishments of
the Reagan administration, with a strong denunciation of Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   He said Dukakis broke his promise to voters in his first term as
governor of Massachusetts by raising taxes, and in his second term
increased state spending and brought on Massachusetts's $400
million deficit.
   ``He taxed the poor, taxed the rich, taxed the young, taxed the
old and taxed the middle class,'' Gramm said of Dukakis. ``He taxed
businesses and he taxed families.
   ``Given his record, is there anybody here who doubts that a
President Dukakis would raise our taxes?'' Gramm said.
   He said Dukakis has opposed ``every major new weapons system
that we have deployed.''
   ``Is there anybody here who doubts that a president Dukakis
would cut defense, wimp America and endanger peace?'' he said.
   Gramm's senior colleague from Texas, Lloyd Bentsen, is the
Democratic vice presidential nominee. Gramm was elected to the
Senate after leaving the Democratic Party.
   Gramm referred to the legislation with which is name is
associated, the Gramm-Rudman law that set automatic
deficit-reduction targets, as ``trying to do the lord's work in the
devil's city.''
   He praised the Reagan economic record as creating 17 million new
jobs and leading an economic boom.
   ``But while the world calls our economic rebirth a miracle, the
Democrats call it a disaster,'' Gramm said. ``They long for the
failed policies of the past.''
   Gramm recounted Bush's war record and credited him with coolness
when the airplane he was piloting was shot down in the Pacific
during World War II. He recounted his business experience in Texas,
Bush's adopted state, and government jobs leading up to his
election as vice president.
   ``George Bush is the greatest vice president this nation has
ever had,'' Gramm said.
   ``I am honored to place in nomination the name of a man who has
served America in war and in peace, who has the experience, the
character and the strength to lead this great land,'' he said.
   Delivering seconding speeches were Paterno; Ninfa Laurenzo of
Houston, Texas; Councilwoman Joanne M. Collins of Kansas City, Mo.;
Rep. Robert K. Dornan of California; Elaine L. Chao, chairman of
the Federal Maritime Commission, and Bush's son Jeb Bush of Miami,
and his wife.

   Here is a transcript of the speech by
Education Secretary William J. Bennett to the Republican National
Convention Wednesday night.
   Ladies and gentlemen, there's a story about a young legislator
who sought the advice of a much older, wiser legislator about how
to conduct himself on the first day of a legislative session.
   The older, wiser legislator said, ``Stand up, say what you have
to say, and sit down.'' And that's what I plan to do.
   Over the past seven years it has been my privilege and pleasure
to work for the greatest president in my lifetime _ Ronald Wilson
Reagan.
   And tonight, we are here to nominate his successor, the vice
president of the United States, the leader of our Republican Party,
and the next leader of the free world _ George Bush.
   Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the Reagan-Bush
administration has helped advance the educational goals of the
American people. I know, cause I've been there. I've visited and
I've taught at over a hundred elementary and secondary schools.
   Plato taught that there is above all one crucial political
question. It is the upbringing of children. The American people
understand this.
   When asked what they want from our schools, Americans
consistently call for two things: teach our children, they say,
teach our children how to speak and write and count and think
correctly; and second, help them develop reliable standards of
right and wrong to guide them through life.
   The American people expect our children to leave school as
better people _ better intellectually and better morally. And they
are right to expect this.
   In the past eight years, the vital terms of the education debate
in this country have changed. Now, the national debate and
discussion on education are focused on issues like standards and
accountability. It's focused on discipline, on instilling
self-discipline in children and getting drugs out of schools.
   It's on learning math, history, geography and science; and its
on mastering the English language; its on honoring our good
teachers, like Jaime Escalante. It's on teaching our moral and
political principles. It's on schools forming character. And now,
finally, it's focused on giving parents a choice in deciding where
their children will go to school.
   Bringing these issues front and center has provoked controversy
from time to time. But there are some fights worth fighting,
   In education, as with other issues, we have witnessed a crucial
shift in the very terms of our national discourse. In reaffirming
our beliefs, Republicans have looked to our founders, to the
Declaration of Independence, to the Constitution, and to our
history.
   And following Lincoln, we have sought guidance from our
Judeo-Christian tradition. We have done this, we have been
criticized for doing this, and we shall continue to do this.
   The extent of our success can be measured by the emptiness of
the new Democratic Party platform. Democratic leaders once used to
celebrate their liberalism unabashedly. Today, they're reluctant
even to utter the word. The Democratic leadership won't come clean,
   But make no mistake: they are still liberals. And their liberal
policies will not sustain the traditions, will not sustain the
institutions, will not sustain the moral values that are at the
foundation of our society.
   Consider the family. The Democratic leadership would make
government not the ally of the family, but its replacement. The
sanctity of human life, moral standards, personal and institutional
responsibility _ even the pledge of allegiance _ too often these
are the subject of denigration or embarrassment among leaders of
the Democratic Party.
   Once it could be said that the leadership of the Democratic
Party _ the Democratic party of Truman, Kennedy and Jackson _
that's Scoop Jackson not Jesse Jackson _ was a proud defender of
freedom. But today's Democratic leadership is not.
   Today's Democratic leaders waver. They are not resolute. They
have lost confidence in our principles and they have lost the will
to defend our principles. They have lost that will both at home and
abroad,
   Why? I'll tell you why. Because the Democratic elites regard
much of American history as a mistake to be corrected, not a legacy
to be extended. Those Democratic leaders need to learn that in the
long history of nations and peoples, the American achievement
stands high. It is rare, and that achievement is worth defending.
   Ladies and gentlemen, the Democratic leadership doesn't
understand this. But George Bush does.
   George Bush knows about the importance of standards, discipline,
choice, accountability, and the teaching of right and wrong.
   George Bush has the experience and the guts to lead this
country. He will protect our precious freedoms. He will help to
educate our precious children. Tonight, I am proud _ we are proud _
to stand with our principles and to stand with George Bush.
   Thank you very much.

   Alas, poor Dan Quayle _ some television game show
fans didn't care to hear about him even if he was chosen Tuesday as
George Bush's vice presidential running mate.
   Station WLS-TV, owned and operated by ABC, ran a bulletin
shortly before 4 p.m, CDT announcing that Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana was Bush's long-awaited choice. But the announcement came
in the final two minutes of the popular game show, ``Jeopardy,''
which, as aficionados know, is the time for ``Final Jeopardy.''
   So, while Quayle's name may have been the answer to the biggest
question of the Republican National Convention, to ``Jeopardy''
viewers it blocked out the eagerly anticipated final answer and
question.
   ``We probably got about 50 to 60 angry telephone calls,'' said
WLS spokeswoman Fran Preston. ``We had to run the final answer and
question on the 4 o'clock news to keep everyone happy.''
   The answer, which always precedes the question, was: ``Hamlet
called him `a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.'''
   The question was: ``Who was Yorick?'' not ``Who is Dan Quayle?''

   A circus tent collapsed during a violent
thunderstorm Wednesday night, injuring about 15 people, officials
said.
   The tent over the one-ring circus fell minutes after the first
90-minute evening show, said Mayor James Boekholt Jr.
   ``It was nice skies, then all of a sudden it turned black and
there was rain and wind,'' he said.
   Firefighters and emergency medical crews, on the scene because
they sponsored the circus, went to the aid of about 40 circusgoers
under the tent, Boekholt said.
   He said the injuries were not life-threatening and ranged from
cuts and bruises to broken bones. Spokeswomen at two hospitals
where most of the injured were taken said at least 13 patients were
being treated and they were expected to be released.
   At the circus, animals were kept under control and did not get
loose, the mayor said.
   Claire Van Genderen, who said she had left the circus with her
young son and husband following the conclusion of the first show,
said the 30-foot-high tent collapsed in gusty winds.
   ``We heard a noise and turned around and it had fallen down,''
she said. ``People were screaming.''
   Boekholt, who came to the scene after the collapse, said the
circus company usually comes to the borough twice a summer for
benefits and had performed last month.
   A second show scheduled for Wednesday night was canceled, and
circus officials could not be reached for comment. The mayor did
not know the circus name but said it was based in Windham, N.Y.,
where there were no telephone listings for circuses.

   President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq was a
dictator who blended firmness with political shrewdness in a
formula that kept him in power 11 years, longer than anyone else in
Pakistan's 41-year history.
   Zia imposed martial law and executed the man he overthrew, but
did not instill the fear of prison and midnight knocks on the door.
   He was a zealous Moslem who stamped Islamic law on his nation,
but did not enforce such cruel punishments as amputation for theft
and stoning to death for adultery.

   The Reagan administration, while joining
Pakistan in mourning the death Wednesday of President Mohammed Zia
ul-Haq, anticipated no slowdown in the flow of U.S. weapons to
Afghan rebels through the South Asian country.
   Nor do U.S. officials expect the loss of the pro-American
strongman to have any noticeable impact on the Soviet army's
orderly withdrawal from Afghanistan which Pakistan helped arrange
last April in Geneva.
   Questions remain on Capitol Hill and within the State Department
whether Pakistan is bent on developing a nuclear bomb. For U.S. aid
to continue, President Reagan must certify in October that Pakistan
does not possess an explosive nuclear device.

   As the initial surprise over Dan Quayle's
selection as George Bush's running mate wore off Wednesday,
questions were raised about just what this second-term senator
brings to the Republican ticket.
   ``Politically, I don't know what he brings to the party,'' said
Richard Bernstein, a delegate from Westchester County, New York.
``I'm not sure I understand the dynamics of it.''
   Bush and his aides argue that the 41-year-old Indiana senator,
as a member of the huge post-World War II generation, will be a
beacon toward the future for young American voters. They also say
he will attract votes in the Midwest, hit hard by farm woes.
   The conservative senator is an attractive, energetic campaigner
who is comfortable with television and the new campaign
technologies of the 1980s, they add.
   But Quayle is unknown outside his native state, a blank slate
for voters that the GOP and the Democrats alike will rush to write
on.

   When George Bush took the fabled torch of
Republican leadership from Ronald Reagan, the first thing he did
was promise the next pass to 41-year-old Dan Quayle. The decision
to skip a generation leaves a number of party stalwarts with mixed
emotions and uncertain ambitions.
   Count Jack Kemp, Phil Gramm _ and who knows how many others _
among the wounded.
   The disappointment may have been sharpest among Kemp and the
other Republicans who had been considered by Bush for the vice
presidential nomination. Each of them knew that win or lose in
November, being on the Bush ticket would provide a leg up for the
next open presidential nomination.
   If Quayle acquits himself nicely between now and November, his
political clout, good looks and reliable conservative record would
make him a tough man to beat.

   George Bush's strategists portray the selection
of Sen. Dan Quayle as his running mate as a bold bid for the
nation's younger generation, but analysts warned Wednesday that as
a voting bloc, the baby boom could prove a bust.
   The problem is that the nation's roughly 75 million baby boomers
make up too large a segment of the population to fit into one
ideological category, experts said. Generational links do not
necessarily mean shared politics.
   ``They have different life experiences and certainly different
values'' from their elders, said Democratic pollster Peter Hart.
``But they're such large share of the American population, they
cross all income, occupational and ideological lines.''
   Bush and his aides touted the 41-year-old Quayle as the first
member of the baby boom generation _ usually defined as Americans
born after World War II and before 1965 _ to run on a major-party
ticket for national office.
   But some cautioned that the stroke may prove too broad. ``In
general, the baby boomers have not voted as a bloc,'' said
Republican pollster Neil Newhouse. Moreover, ``Young people have
never reliably voted,'' he said.

   Housing construction rose a moderate 2.4
percent in July, the government reported Wednesday, but economists
warned that rising mortgage rates could make the two-month housing
rebound a brief one.
   The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were being
built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.49 million units
last month after advancing 4.4 percent in June.
   Housing starts had dropped a sharp 12.1 percent in May to the
slowest pace in three years, and rising mortgage rates were blamed.

   About 3,000 miners have been holed up in the July Manifesto

   Workers at the July Manifesto mine declared an occupation strike

<HEAD>VCRs Turning Television Viewing into Video Campfires, Studies Show</HEAD>

   VCRs are turning television viewing into
video campfire gatherings _ kids and parents not only watching more
prime-time TV together, but also talking to each other more, recent
studies show.
   ``When a VCR comes into a household and the household has
children, people tend to talk to each other more,'' said Southern
Illinois University Professor Carolyn Lin, who has studied home
video cultures since 1984.
   ``They have to negotiate about what videos to rent and when to
play these videos,'' Ms. Lin explained. ``If someone wants to
`time-shift' (record) a show for later viewing the person will have
to get consent from the other people as well.''
   More communication is only one side effect of families adding
video cassette recorders to their television sets. Although many
homes have more than one set, VCRs are bringing people together to
watch a single screen, much like the campfires of yesteryear.
   In a survey of 233 VCR homes in three Midwestern communities,
Ms. Lin found that after adding a video recorder 58 percent of the
people spent more time watching TV with the family and 35 percent
spent more time having video parties at home.
   ``Pre-recorded cassettes appear to have brought back `family
viewing' during prime time,'' said Debra Krayson of AGB Television
Research. Prime time tape viewing ``not only brings the family
together but also appears to be a social event. AGB data show a
significant number of guests in the audience.''
   AGB, a British-owned firm that recently withdrew from the battle
for U.S. use of People Meter measurement of viewers per set,
tracked national VCR recording and playback last April.
   The number of prime-time viewers watching movies and other
prerecorded tapes averaged nearly three persons per household,
according to AGB. Regular prime-time TV programs averaged 1.7
persons per household.
   Studies by academic and commercial researchers now provide a
profile of the impact of VCRs, now found in 56 percent of U.S.
homes. Just five years ago only 10 percent of households had video
recorders, said Tom Lederback of the Electronic Industries
Association@Consumer Electronics Group.
   VCRs were reported by nearly two-thirds of those polled in a
Gallup survey of homes with telephones for the electronics trade
group last Spring. Video recorders were second in popularity only
to TV sets themselves, found in 99 percent of the households.
   The Gallup survey found 78 percent of the households with
children had VCRs; versus 63 percent of the two-adult homes and 40
percent of the singles.
   Children are the VCRs' most avid users, spending 50 percent more
time watching tapes than adults. According to the AGB study
released last month, children under 18 spend an average of 3.4
hours a week watching videotapes, while adults average 2.3 hours
weekly.
   Teen-agers developed their own versions of video campfires,
often watching tapes in groups at parties. Often they have little
adult supervision, said Ms. Lin.
   Despite parent group fears that racy adult videos are the
biggest video moneymakers, 1987 Video Software Dealers Association
figures show comedy and action@adventure tapes are tops with nearly
20 percent of the dollar volume apiece. Adult videos rank fourth
behind drama at 11.4 percent.
   Though video stores have reigned as the place to find VCR tapes,
more convenience stores, record shops, supermarkets, and bookstores
are now stocking cassettes, according to a survey of the booming
business released at the recent software dealers meeting in Las
Vegas.
   ``Last year and this year business has been real good,'' said
association spokesman Ray Gianchetti. Sixty-six percent of the
video merchants surveyed by the group said business went up from
1985 to 1987, according to the poll released at last week's
convention.
   Tape rental prices averaged $2.45 per tape in 1987, video stores
stock an average of 2,832 titles, and the number of videos rented
per visit was 2.3, the survey revealed. While most video time is
spent viewing pre-recorded tapes, some folks use their VCRs to
record programs for later viewing.
   Of the seven hours of an average week when the VCR is in use 2.4
hours are spent recording programs and 4.7 hours viewing tapes, AGB
reported last March. Twenty-three percent of the time is used
taping shows for later viewing, known as ``time-shifting.''.
   Homes with pay cable channels spent more time recording and less
time playing tapes than those without cable, the study found. Most
taping is during evening prime-time hours or during weekdays and
most viewing is during weekend days, late nights and early
mornings.

   President Reagan this month approved the
costliest disaster relief measure ever enacted for farmers. This
report, one of an occasional series on the drought and the Chases
of Barry County, Mich., looks at how one troubled farm family is
reaching for Washington's helping hand.

   Jean and Gordon Chase have been feeding
their dairy cows an apple pulp-and-cereal mix so that their hay
supply, practically wiped out by the drought of '88, will last the
year.
   But now they question the wisdom of their hard-headed planning.
   Their feed supply means they may not be eligible to buy as much
discount corn as they hoped from the federal government under a
drought-relief plan just signed into law.
   The Chases are disappointed, but they aren't surprised.
   ``All along, what these government programs have done is allow
the poor manager to last longer,'' says Gordon Chase, shaking his
head and wiping his brow in the heat of the family den.
   Farm subsidy programs are a sensitive subject for the Chases, as
they are for other farmers who pride themselves on their
independence. They insist they don't want handouts, but acknowledge
they do need help and are frustrated when they don't qualify.
   ``You hear more and more farmers talking about that now than
ever before _ that a handout is not what we want,'' says Jean
Chase. ``We don't want something that helps temporarily, but will
help us establish solutions for these kinds of problems in the
future.''
   Part of that solution may be federal crop insurance.
   With their son, Kurt, and his wife, Dena, the Chases farm 1,100
acres of wheat, soybeans and corn here in southwest Michigan.
   They took out only enough crop insurance this year to cover 66
acres of string beans they were growing for a canning company. They
plan to expand their coverage next year, although they don't know
by how much. The Chases saw the advantages of insurance after their
beans, though intensely irrigated, died under the hot sun.
   The Chases grow frustrated when they see farmers receiving large
government relief payments after they have been careless in their
business.
   ``We don't like to take it and yet we're greedy and get upset
when we don't qualify when we see other people who do,'' says Mrs.
Chase, 51.
   It also bothers the Chases that the subsidies create some public
resentment toward farmers.
   ``They've caused some hard feelings among other businesses and
that's tough to deal with,'' says Gordon Chase, 51, as he sips iced
tea in the 95-degree heat.
   But the Chases know they cannot afford to ignore the subsidies.
   They have applied for government assistance under the new relief
law, anticipating at least a 35-percent loss in crops because of
the drought, the minimum loss covered by the Washington aid program.
   The government's $3.9 billion drought-relief plan will
compensate farmers for 65 percent of the crop revenues they lose
above that minimum, up to $100,000.
   Although many of the Chases' 350 acres of corn are lost, some
plants were revived by recent rains and are growing small,
underdeveloped ears. Their wheat harvest was healthy, but their 200
acres of soybeans will survive only if more rain falls.
   With the harvest still weeks away, they cannot be sure of their
yield.
   ``You'd rather have the crop that you've worked so hard on,''
Mrs. Chase says. ``But at this point, we don't even know if we'll
be getting any assistance at all.''
   Because of their feed shortage, the Chases hoped to get a
discount on low-cost government corn. But the local Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service office says the Chases will
be eligible to buy only 90 days' worth of feed at the discounted
price, less than they sought for feeding their 300 head of dairy
and beef cattle.
   One bright spot: The drought-relief law cancels a planned
reduction in dairy price levels under the government's
market-support program. Under the plan, the price farmers get for
their milk would have been cut to $10.10 per hundredweight from
$10.60.
   For the Chases, whose 125 milk cows each produce an average
19,000 pounds of milk per year, that 50-cent cut would have hurt.
   Reducing price supports was to have been one of a series of
moves to cut back on the accumulation of costly surplus stocks of
dairy products. But the Chases believe such methods may actually
add to the financial plight of farmers.
   Under the Dairy Termination Program, part of the 1985 Farm Bill,
the federal government paid dairy farmers to get out of the
business. The program was partly funded by farmers who chose to
stay in dairying.
   The Chases estimate about $1,500 came out of their milk checks
each month to fund the 18-month program.
   ``When they cut your prices to help take care of a surplus, at
least from our standpoint, it doesn't work,'' Chase says.
   ``Because we're in debt, we have to have a certain amount of
money flowing through this business every month. So when they cut
your prices, you have to do something, so we milked more cows,''
Chase says. ``That defeats the whole purpose of what the
government's trying to do, but you have no choice.''
   The Chases are quick to admit they don't have any answers. But
they like the sound of a quota system, like one in Canada, under
which the government pays a relatively high price for a certain
amount of crops or milk from each farmer, then cuts the payment
drastically for anything beyond that set amount. That system keeps
surpluses down.
   A twist of nature, however, like the drought of '88, can undo
any system.
   ``When you have a year like this, I don't think there are any
real answers,'' Chase says.

<HEAD>Two Very Different Things: Credit Card Interest and Mortgage Rates</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recent increases in short-term interest rates
could hurt homebuyers and homeowners whose monthly payments are
based on variable-rate mortgages. No question about it.
   But credit card users could be hurt even worse.
   First reactions to the increases focused almost entirely on
housing, since by far the greatest variable debt is owed in this
category. But interest on most home mortgages remains
tax-deductible; most credit card debt isn't.
   Moreover, much credit card interest is at rates actually double
that on many home mortgages. In addition, many credit card users
incur fees that, if added to the posted rate, would bring it beyond
20 percent a year.
   Credit card debt is especially sensitive, too. Whereas most home
mortgage loans vary only on a six-month to three-year basis _
meaning delays in increases could be that long _ credit card
interest can change very quickly.
   In addition, home mortgage debt is actually an investment in the
sense that increases in home prices might entirely offset any rise
in interest costs.
   Most credit card debt offers no such offset; generally, it is
used to pay for items that have been completedly consumed, such as
vacations, or for items of eroding rather than increasing valuue.
   And, of course, Uncle Sam's tax code does very little to help
credit card users adjust to the higher costs.
   Until 1986, all credit card interest constituted a deduction on
federal income tax returns. The Tax Act of 1986 cut that to 65
percent in 1987 and 40 percent this year. The percentage falls to
20 in 1989, and 10 in 1990.
   Because of its relatively low interest rate and full
tax-deductibility, home mortgage debt remains the only tax shelter
available to most people, and it is an enormous one.
   So great is it, and so much of a departure from the treatment
afforded other debt, that real estate and housing people are
convinced an attack on it will be launched in Congress next year.
   Meanwhile, statistical evidence suggests Americans are very
aware of the friendly treatment accorded housing debt. Despite
interest rates edging higher, sales of existing homes in June rose
for the fifth straight month.
   The latest interest rate increases, to 6.5 percent for the
Federal Reserve discount rate and 10 percent on the prime lending
rate, may eventually take a toll on home sales and housing starts.
But even this is not a certainty.
   In their August analysis, for example, economists of the
National Association of Realtors said expected rises in interest
rates might encourage many potential homebuyers to purchase home
earlier than they had planned.
   Such a phenomenon would not be new; in the 1970s, many couples
bought houses earlier than they had planned in order to beat rising
prices. And the same behavior has long been observed in automobile
markets.
   Besides, there is a fair chance that higher interest rates
might, in the long run, be offset entirely by increases in the
market value of the house that is purchased with the debt. What
could be more comforting than that?
   Or, on the other hand, what could be more distressing than to
pay increasing rates of interest for goods or services whose value
is declining or already used up?
   That is the situation in which credit card borrowers might find
themselves.

   On many trains, speed thrills. Scenery
flashes past, and passengers dart from side to side to view this
mountain or that river.
   Not so with a pair of popular rail excursions that amble through
wilderness in Northern California, barely faster than the
stagecoaches that preceded them more than a century ago.
   What the Skunk and North Coast Daylight trains lack in miles per
hour, they make up for in dense redwood groves, remote river
canyons and all-aboard camaraderie.
   The revival of the North Coast Daylight for a second straight
summer run has enabled railroad buffs to witness a rare sight in
this town 130 miles north of San Francisco: two passenger trains
arriving at the same time.
   ``It reminds me of the old days,'' said Jim Claveo of San
Francisco, arriving on the Daylight after the 10-hour, 144-mile
trip from Eureka. ``They're very friendly, more friendly than on
most trains.
   ``You ride it for the scenery, and you also ride it for the
nostalgia.''
   The Skunk Train, running along a 103-year-old line through
Mendocino County woods to Fort Bragg on the coast, has been full of
like-minded tourists all summer despite last year's complaints
about heavy logging spoiling part of the view.
   Bob Reid, who has crammed 151 tourist pins onto his crowded
conductor's cap, keeps travelers amused in his role as
ticket-checker, guide and glad-hander.
   ``I've been working for this railroad for 27 years, and it's
still fun,'' said the Fort Bragg resident. ``Every day I meet new
people from all over the world. There's only one Skunk Train.''
   There was no North Coast Daylight train for almost two years
following its ill-fated summer debut in 1985.
   On one of its early runs that year, the train was stranded by a
landslide in the Eel River Canyon just 27 miles out of Willits.
Financial problems and winter track damage caused suspension of the
run, and service didn't resume until a year ago when Eureka
Southern took over the line.
   The train is a reincarnation of the old Shasta Daylight that
served the West Coast decades ago. It generally consists of eight
cars: turquoise coaches, Shasta Daylight lounge cars with plush
interiors and padded seats, a rare Southern Pacific club car with a
standup bar decorated in ranch motif, and a classic Frisco Line
parlor car where passengers may be served calzone or lasagna.
   Winding through the canyon on weather-beaten tracks that slow
its speed to 10 mph, the North Coast Daylight can hit a rollicking
30 mph on straightaways. Twenty-nine tunnels enliven the trip, much
of which is through wild terrain far from the nearest road.
   In addition to the usual sun-worshipers and skinny-dippers,
passengers on one recent trip were treated to the sights of deer,
bears, raccoons, river otters, wild pigs, an elk and an osprey
clutching a trout in its beak along the peaceful banks of the Eel.
   ``The Eel River Canyon is one of the most beautiful river
canyons I've ever seen,'' said Anne Tolleson of Santa Rosa. ``It's
a great ride if you're not in a hurry.''
   Further north, the train chugs through the redwood forests of
Humboldt County and past one of the world's largest redwood mills
in Scotia, the town of Fortuna and the dairy community of Loleta
before ending the outbound half of the journey on the coast at
Eureka.
   Eureka Southern has a half-dozen more weekend trips, with
overnight layovers in Eureka, scheduled from August through
mid-October. Business has been good enough, at 150 to 200
passengers per trip, that the railroad plans to expand the schedule
next year, according to business manager Steve Branstetter.
   The Skunk, meanwhile, continues to lure enough train fans to
operate year-round.
   Gerald Allen, general manager of the Fort Bragg-based California
Western Railroad that took it over in 1987, says the train should
match last year's near-record total of 70,000 passengers taking the
daily trips out of either Fort Bragg or Willits. About half the
riders hail from the San Francisco Bay area.
   The line was founded as a logging railroad in 1885. Steam
passenger service began in 1904 and was extended to Willits seven
years later.
   Gas engines replaced steam in 1925, and the train's famous
moniker was born shortly thereafter by trainmen who remarked that
the smelly fumes had the aroma of a skunk. Today's trains are
almost all diesel-powered, but the name has proven longer-lasting
than the polecat's pungency.
   The serpentine route could be a roller coaster, climbing from
sea level to 1,740 feet, crossing 31 bridges and trestles and
disappearing into two pitch-black mountain tunnels.
   But top speed of 20 mph _ the average is 13 mph _ keeps this a
leisurely family experience. The Skunk even stops to pick up
campers or deliver groceries, mail and medicine to areas
inaccessible by car.
   Passengers are let out for half an hour in deep woods at
Northspur, the line's midway point, where they can buy snacks and
gaze up at coastal redwoods towering more than 300 feet.
   Repeat patrons may notice a few more bare patches than in past
years on the Fort Bragg half of the line.
   ``We never considered clear-cutting to be a major problem, but
there are certainly some areas out there that are not the Avenue of
the Giants by any stretch of the imagination,'' said Allen.
   ``Everybody wants a redwood deck, and that's where they come
from.''

   Cleaning up the savings and loan debacle will
cost at least $40 billion and perhaps $100 billion, experts say.
Already, several little-known thrifts have required bailouts larger
than Chrysler Corp. The commonly cited cause is the economic
downturn in the Southwest. But there is much more. Behind the
headlines is a story of fraud and greed, mismanagement and
government bungling. It all adds up to one of the most expensive
fiascoes in U.S. history.

   Don R. Dixon had all the trappings of success: a
California beach house, trips to European spas, a $5 million in
art, Rolls Royces and $110 perfume bottles for his wife.
   He traveled on corporate jets, relaxed on a corporate yacht,
entertained politicians. Dixon's salary and benefits ran in the
millions.
   Federal officials say that the ``indulgent and opulent
lifestyle,'' right down to the perfume, was financed by the savings
bank Dixon owned, Vernon Savings and Loan.
   Ultimately, however, the U.S. government paid. Vernon S&L was
declared hopelessly insolvent and was closed. It cost the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. more than $1.3 billion to pay off
Vernon's depositors _ making it one of the biggest bailouts in U.S.
history and about the same size as the Chrysler Corp. rescue.
   Dixon faces a civil suit accusing him of falsifying financial
statements and ``systematic looting and wasting the assets'' of
Vernon, which was named for a small Texas town. He's moved to
California, filed for personal bankruptcy protection, denied the
accusations in court but declined to answer questions before
regulators.
   Two former Vernon vice presidents and a former president have
pleaded guilty to various bank fraud charges and agreed to
cooperate with prosecutors. One has even admitted hiring
prostitutes for a board meeting. Dixon, authorities say, is a top
target of the most extensive white-collar criminal investigation in
Justice Department history.
   And Don Dixon is something more: an example of the roots of the
U.S. savings and loan crisis.
   While the S&L catastrophe has been triggered by the downfall of
the Southwest economy, it has been exaggerated by the high-flying
antics of ``entrepreneurs'' in Texas, California and other states
who, either through fraud, mismanagement or bad decisions, created
billion-dollar messes.
   ``For some few unscrupulous individuals, it was simply an
accepted way of doing business,'' said Marvin Collins, the U.S.
attorney for north Texas. ``That small percentage had a tremendous
impact.''
   About one-sixth of the nation's 3,000 S&Ls were insolvent at the
end of 1987. They stretched from Alaska to Florida; Texas had 128.
Most were well-managed institutions that fell on hard times,
regulators say. But as Congress tries to save the industry credited
with financing the American dream of home ownership, it has become
increasingly clear that the S&L story is not simply one of an
economic downturn.
   Without the fraud, ``you don't have the problem you have
today,'' said M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board and the nation's chief S&L regulator. ``There are others
besides Vernon that will prove to have been fraudulent.''
   And there's more. Regulators themselves have been called on the
carpet by congressional committees and others for failing to watch
over the industry.
   The federal regulatory staff in California fell from 200 to 40
in the early 1980s. The Southwest office lost most of its staff
when it moved from Little Rock, Ark., to Dallas. Some Texas S&Ls
didn't have audits for three years. Questions were raised about
Vernon in 1983, but nothing was done because of insufficient staff,
regulators say.
   Texas regulators were also stranded when the state Legislature
redirected fees from savings and loans to help balance the general
budget, a governor's task force found.
   ``There was no one looking after the shop,'' said banking
analyst Frank Anderson of D. Latin & Co. ``The people in
Washington, before Danny Wall came (in 1987), had no clue.''
   S&L executives, including Tom Wageman, chairman of Sunbelt
Savings in Dallas, blame a series of rules changes for causing
havoc and opening the dirty dealings door.
   Even the cleanup has been troubled.
   _ For months after the problems were discovered, losses for the
industry continued at the rate of $1 million an hour because the
FSLIC didn't have enough money to close down the insolvent thrifts.
   _ Healthy institutions must pay special assessments to cover the
losses _ a policy one leading S&L banker has dubbed ``vampire
economics.''
   _ Wall's ``Southwest Plan'' was scheduled to sell or close at
least two insolvent S&Ls a week, but in its first six months
handled only a handful.
   _ Some in Congress have complained the bank board has been
handing out the few billions it does have without proper debate.
   ``It is incomprehensible to me that a sense of crisis has yet to
develop around this issue,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a
House Banking Committee member.
   And not everyone is convinced the questionable practices have
ended.
   ``I originally predicted that the bulk of this activity was
historical,'' said Collins, the federal prosecutor.
``Unfortunately, I think there is still some of it going on.''

   Need an office building, apartment complex,
condominium, hotel or maybe a bowling alley or exotic car
dealership? Call the government.
   How 'bout a bed-and-breakfast resort? A half-million-dollar
luxury yacht? A wild animal park? A wine store? A restaurant, or
even a livestock ranch?
   Yup, Uncle Sam's got what you're looking for.
   As savings and loans have failed and been taken over by federal
regulators, much of the property and perks behind all those bad
loans has ended up in the hands of the government, which has become
one of the Southwest's biggest landlords.
   In all, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. currently
has $7.65 billion worth of received assets.
   Some of the millions of square feet of living and working space
is for sale; some is simply being held back until the Southwest
real estate market improves.
   Some of it is already built, rented and occupied. A lot of it is
vacant and abandoned and may never sell. Empty office buildings are
called ``see-throughs.'' A few abandoned apartment complexes are
referred to as ``S&L slums.''
   Vernon Savings and Loan, a high-flying thrift whose failure has
cost the FSLIC $1.3 billion, had $2.1 billion worth of assets.
Right now, the government is offering part of that loot _ 101
former Vernon assets valued at $600 million, said Larry Akins,
who's handling the Vernon portfolio.
   The offerings include former Vernon owner Don Dixon's $4 million
exotic car dealership in La Jolla, Calif., as well as the ``High
Spirits,'' a 112-foot luxury yacht that is a sister ship to the
former presidential yacht ``Sequoia.''
   The FSLIC and the agency set up to help dispose of much of the
property, the Federal Asset Disposition Association, each publish
monthly catalogues with all the stuff that's on the block.
   In addition to the standard condos, apartments, strip shopping
centers and office buildings, there's an aircraft hanger, a Houston
convenience story, a truck terminal and a medical building or two.
   ``Most of it is good quality, attractive stuff,'' Akins said.
   It's not all in Texas, off course. Wild Bill's Motel in Carson
City, Nev., is for sale, as is a Palm Springs, Calif., guest ranch,
a non-operating health club in Mandeville, La., Westwood Bowling in
Norman, Okla., a Baton Rouge, La., water park and the Choice
Restaurant in Memphis, Tenn.
   The FSLIC even has a showroom in Dallas decorated with glossy
wall-size slides of the spoils of government bailouts. The 13-story
building housing the office is for sale, of course: probably a
steal at $12 million.

   The 2,000 acres of pastureland in south Fort Worth
may not seem like much, but at one time the property was so hot
you'd think it held both gold and oil.
   Back in 1983, the land sold twice in one day. Then again three
days later. Then again, and again, and again, and again. Seven
times in less than two years. And the price kept going higher, from
more than $17 million to almost $65 million.
   Federal officials say the tract is an example of ``land flips,''
an illegal practice where a piece of land is sold rapidly,
sometimes even several times the same day, at wildly escalating
prices justified only by fraudulent appraisals.
   Developers and savings and loan executives ``flipped'' land to
drive up the price to unsuspecting buyers, to generate cash or
improve the bottom line of their loan portfolios, regulators say.
   And, analysts say, ``flips'' were one of the major contributors
to the huge losses at several insolvent thrifts.
   ``These guys that were out there doing flips _ they were
artifically inseminating the market,'' said banking analyst Frank
Anderson of the D. Latin Co. in Dallas. ``There was a perception of
a boom that wasn't.''
   Land flips are part of a massive investigation launched by the
Justice Department into the savings and loan debacle.
   And they were at the center of the collapse of Empire Savings &
Loan, federal officials have said. Empire failed in 1984, and a
four-year investigation has yielded charges against 110 people,
officals said. The probe culminated in an 88-count indictment
against seven people charging a $100 million conspiracy to defraud
five S&Ls, based largely on elaborate land flips.

   It was a quiet, late-summer Tuesday, and nothing
extraordinary was happening in the financial world.
   In Washington, a Central Intelligence Agency official testified
at the Iran-Contra hearings. In Boston, a judge ruled that warning
labels on cigarette packs protected tobacco companies from
product-liability suits.
   And in New York, where the high temperature for the day was a
benign 76 degrees, the stock market reached a record level for the
55th time since the start of the year.
   Nobody knew _ though lots of people later claimed to have called
it _ that on Aug. 25, 1987, one of the mightest bull markets in
history was breathing its last gasp.
   From its closing peak that day of 2,722.42, the Dow Jones
industrial average was about to embark on a slide of almost 1,000
points in less than two months. It has not been anywhere close to
2,700 since.
   A year after the bull's last romp, Wall Street is still
struggling to pull itself back together. While stock prices have
rallied from their lows of late 1987, the recovery has been
tentative and sluggish.
   At the same time, a good many analysts have begun to see
disturbing parallels between today's economic setting and the
circumstances that prevailed in the summer of 1987.
   A strong economy has touched off fears of renewed inflation, and
the Federal Reserve, which raised the discount rate last Sept. 4,
has once more increased that influential interest rate.
   ``If you believe, as I do, that the October crash was no
accident _ that it was a response to certain events and an early
warning of problems to come _ then the answer would be yes, it
could happen again,'' said Charles LaLoggia in his investment
advisory letter LaLoggia's Special Situation Report.
   In LaLoggia's view, credit-tightening by the Fed and other
nations' central banks set the stage for the drop last year.
``These same central bankers are now making the same mistake all
over again,'' he contends.
   More optimistic observers argue that, whatever similarities
exist, there are important difference in today's climate from that
of a year ago.
   Then the dollar was spiraling downward in foreign exchange
markets. Recently it has rebounded, to the extent that policymakers
have taken steps to try to keep it from rising too fast.
   Stock prices themselves are, of course, much lower than their
year-ago levels, and by any standard statistical measure do not
reflect the degree of exuberance they showed last summer.
   The crash ``was a reaction to a ridiculously overpriced
market,'' argues Roger Engemann, head of a Pasadena, Calif.,
investment management firm that bears his name.
   ``There is no reason in the world to believe that the next five
to 10 years are going to be worse than the last five to 10 in the
economy. The current period of hesitation in the stock market will
resolve itself with a substantial rise,'' Engemann says.
   If stocks today are lower than they were last August, are they
``cheap?'' You can get a good argument either way right now,
depending on which analyst you ask.
   The price-to-earnings ratio of 30 stocks in the Dow Jones
industrial average stood at 14.7 to 1 early this month, down from
20.5 to 1 a year earlier. In the bear markets of the 1970s,
however, it spent a long time in the neighborhood of 8 to 1.
   Another closely watched indicator _ the spread between yields on
high-grade corporate bonds and the blue chip stocks that make up
the Dow industrials _ stood recently at 6.05 percentage points, not
a whole lot below the 6.77-point differential of a year ago.
   That shows, some observers argue, that stocks are almost as
vulnerable as they were last year to stiff competition from
interest-bearing investments.
   Whatever the market does from here on out, brokers say, at least
it will not have to face selling of huge bundles of stocks prompted
by the phenomenon known as ``portfolio insurance.'' This approach
to professional money management, which was widely blamed for
exacerbating the crash, is much less popular now than it was before
the fall.
   With the advantage of hindsight, the market peak stands as a
monument to the hazards of forecasting stock prices.
   There was, for instance, the analyst who told a reporter on the
very day that prices topped out: ``Confirmation of unit volume
growth in the economy is unleashing the market to another explosive
move on the upside, which could easily take us through 3,000 on the
Dow.''

   The U.S. trade deficit widened to $12.5
billion in June as imports hit an all-time high, according to a
government report that analysts said shows how far the country
still has to go to solve its trade problems.
   The gap between what America exports and what the country
imports surged by 28.5 percent in June, a major setback after three
consecutive monthly improvements, the Commerce Department said
Tuesday.
   For the first six months of the year, the deficit was running at
an annual rate of $140 billion, down from the record $170.3 billion
deficit set in 1987.

   Oil futures were weaker in quiet markets ahead
of an American Petroleum Institute report indicating a decline in
crude oil stocks during the past week.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for September
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, fell 12 cents a barrel to close at $15.49 a barrel on
Tuesday.
   Refined products traded on the exchange also rose. Contracts for
September delivery of wholesale heating oil decreased 0.24 cent to
finish at 44.03 cents a gallon, while September gasoline slipped
0.26 cent to 46.11 a gallon.
   Crude oil futures opened the day stronger than expected in thin
dealings, then eased off as traders awaited the American Petroleum
Institute's weekly report on oil inventories, analysts said.
   The report, released after the market closed, showed crude oil
stocks fll by 3.6 million barrels, gasoline inventories rose 1.5
million barrels and distillate stocks rose 1.4 million barrels in
the past week.
   Reports that ministers from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries were talking of a November meeting did little
to spur Tuesday's energy prices, analysts said.

   Polaroid Corp. will remain a takeover
target despite new barriers to hostile bids, analysts said after
the company rejected a buyout offer from a California investment
firm owned by a Disney family member.
   Polaroid's 13-member board of directors unanimously rejected as
inadequate a bid valued at roughly $3 billion Tuesday from Roy E.
Disney's Shamrock Holdings Inc., and said it planned to remain
independent.
   Polaroid also said it was lowering to 20 percent from 40 percent
the stock ownership threshold that automatically triggers its
anti-takeover ``poison pill,'' which is designed to make a hostile
merger prohibitively expensive.
   ``It says they're clearly intending to fight this thing,'' said
Alex Henderson of Prudential Bache Securities. ``I think it's
significant in that Polaroid is willing to be pro-active in
expanding its defenses.''
   But he said Polaroid probably would be willing to entertain a
lucrative offer. ``The ultimate weapon in all this is money,'' said
Chuck Ryan of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York. ``If the
offer is high enough, what was unfriendly can become friendly.''
   Shamrock, which owns 6.9 percent of Polaroid, last week
sweetened its offer of $40 a share to include 40 percent of any
settlement in Polaroid's $5.7 billion patent infringement case
against Eastman Kodak Co.
   The base $40 a share values the company at $2.88 billion, or
$2.48 billion if Shamrock succeeds in rolling back a recent issue
of 10 million shares that it objects to.
   The payment of 40 percent of the Kodak settlement could add $400
million to $800 million to the value of the deal, assuming the
Kodak settlement falls in the range of $1 billion to $2 billion.
   ``The Polaroid board concluded that Shamrock's proposal is
inadequate and not in the best interests of the company and its
stockholders,'' Polaroid stated.
   Shamrock spokesman Thomas Reed declined to comment on Polaroid's
rejection or his firm's future plans.
   Analysts said they were not surprised Polaroid that rebuffed the
buyout offer and expected Shamrock to make a hostile bid soon.
   Polaroid's rejection came as Shamrock received federal clearance
Tuesday to buy 50 percent or more of Polaroid's outstanding shares
and a New York investment house reportedly made a friendly takeover
proposal for Polaroid.
   In its statement, Polaroid said the board also voted unanimously
to remain independent ``in light of the business, financial
condition and bright future prospects of the company, including the
status of the pending Eastman Kodak litigation.''
   The board determined ``it would be in the best interests of
Polaroid and its stockholders...to continue as an independent,
publicly owned company, and that the sale of the company would not
be appropriate.''
   Analysts were divided over whether Polaroid's statement that it
would remain independent means it will not consider any future
takeover offers or is simply ruling out Shamrock.
   ``I've always had the impression they would want to remain
independent and not be taken over by these people,'' said William
Relyea of Eberstadt Fleming Inc. ``They take into account the
direction of the company and the employees more than other groups
might tend to.''
   Shamrock has interests in three television and 14 radio
stations, an energy services company and 56 home entertainment
software stores in Los Angeles.
   Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that
Polaroid had rejected a friendly takeover proposal made by the New
York investment firm of Forstmann Little & Co., but said the firm
may pursue a bid at a later time. Forstmann and Polaroid declined
to comment on the report.
   Forstmann, a private New York leveraged buyout firm with
diversified corporate holdings, has more than $2.5 billion in
capital. It has acquired more than $5 billion in companies,
including Lear Siegler Inc., Dr. Pepper Co., Cybron Corp.,
Midland-Ross Corp. and The Topps Co. Inc., in recent years.

   The family feud over the future of R.P. Scherer
Corp. hinged on a proxy battle waged today at the capsule
manufacturing company's annual meeting.
   The proxy fight, the culmination of months of legal wrangling,
pitted Karla Scherer Fink, daughter of the company's founder, and
her brother against Peter Fink, her husband, who also is Scherer's
president and chief executive officer.
   Fink, who together with brother John S. Scherer controls about
38 percent of the company's stock, is seeking three seats on the
11-member board of directors to help further her push to sell off
the company, the world's biggest producer of gelatin capsules for
the pharmaceutical and vitamin industries.
   As the company's largest shareholder, Fink already is a board
member; her brother is up for re-election.
   Results of the vote were not expected to be known immediately.
   Fink has been pressing for some time to sell the company as a
means of disposing of her stake and maximizing shareholder value.
She reportedly filed for divorce in mid-May, about two weeks after
the board rejected her proposal to sell the company.
   ``The people who own the company should make this decision,''
John Scherer said in a statement last month. ``There are members of
management who obviously believe otherwise, for their own
self-serving reasons. They are wrong to think their harassment can
intimidate Karla into backing off.''
   In a July 28 letter to stockholders, Karla Fink and her brother
noted that Peter Fink and Scherer Chairman Wilbur H. Mack earned
more than $3 million between April 1, 1985, and March 31.
   ``In our opinion it is perfectly clear who are the real
beneficiaries of Scherer management's economic policy: the top
executives,'' the letter said.
   Peter Fink responded in a letter to shareholders that he was
dismayed by criticism over the very compensation his wife had
approved while serving as a Scherer director.
   He linked the company's strong performance to management skills
and urged shareholders to reject his wife's ``handpicked nominees.''
   Scherer reported net income of $12.8 million, up 44 percent in
the fiscal year ended March 31. Sales jumped 27 percent to $290.7
million.
   Karla Fink and her brother said the strong financial performance
made it an opportune time to sell the company, but Peter Fink said
the board was convinced that shareholders would be served best by
remaining independent.
   Still pending Tuesday before the Michigan Court of Appeals was a
ruling on stock carrying a potentially pivotal 9.3 percent of
Scherer's voting power.
   The court action involves a block of 470,000 shares in two
family trusts administered by Manufacturers National Bank. Karla
Fink and her brother, beneficiaries of the trusts, argued that
Manufacturers National Bank had conflicting interests.
   A probate court judge named an independent fiduciary on Monday
to decide how to vote on the stock, but Wayne County Circuit Judge
Kathleen MacDonald vacated that ruling Tuesday, reinstating the
bank as trustee and allowing it to vote the block at the annual
meeting.
   Attorneys for Karla Fink appealed the ruling to the state Court
of Appeals, said Beth Lyons, spokeswoman for the Mrs. Fink and her
brother.
   Troy-based Scherer employs about 2,800 people at 22 facilities
in 13 countries.

<HEAD>Rise In Upper Midwest Farmland Values Slows With Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drought may be hindering a rally in
the value of upper Midwestern farmland, but most agricultural
bankers expect stable land prices going into the fall, according to
a new survey.
   The survey of 500 bankers in five states indicates the value of
farmland in the region rose only 1 percent during the second
quarter of 1988, Peter Heffernan, an analyst with the Federal
Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a recent interview.
   Nevertheless, the rising prices represented the sixth
consecutive quarter of increases following a slump in land values
over the first half of this decade.
   Regional land values were hardest hit by the drought in
Michigan, where prices dropped nearly 2 percent, and in Wisconsin,
where prices fell 1 percent, the survey indicated.
   Illinois land values rose 1.4 percent during the April-June
quarter, Iowa land values rose 3.2 percent and Indiana land values
remained stable.
   ``Undoubtedly, the problems and uncertainties surrounding the
effects of the drought had a significant bearing on their
responses,'' said Heffernan. ``The bankers expectations regarding
the third quarter trend in farmland values is less optimistic than
in earlier surveys.''
   Heffernan said 31 percent of the bankers expected land prices to
decline during the third quarter of 1988, while 60 percent
predicted stable land values during July, August and September.
Nine percent expect prices to rise this quarter, he said.
   Intense heat and one of the worst droughts of the century have
combined to severely damage key U.S. farm crops such as corn and
soybeans. The fall harvest of those commodities is expected to be
sharply reduced.
   But University of Illinois land economist John Scott said his
survey of more than 400 farm appraisers in Illinois, Iowa, Indiana
and Ohio suggests the drought will have only a minor impact on land
prices.
   ``The consensus that emerged from the responses was that if the
drought has any impact at all it will only last one year, and might
represent a short decline in land values,'' said Scott.
   He said the appraisers expect any crop losses in 1988 to be
offset by a good production year in 1989, ``and then land prices
will move to higher levels in coming years.''
   Scott also said higher commodity prices resulting from the small
harvest and the reduction of the grain surplus will help the land
market rally.
   While those factors might tempt farmers to invest in more land
to expand their operations, Scott urged caution.
   ``Only when a farmer is financially capable and can pencil out,
through his revenue projections, the ability to pay for the land,
should he consider buying it,'' said Scott.
   He said the next rally in land prices would be different from
the one in the 1970s, which was fueled by inflation. He said some
farmers thought inflation would pay for the land, and they spent
more for it than they ever could recover from farm earnings.

<HEAD>Shortage of Offshore Oil Workers Could Threaten Gulf Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An upturn in the energy industry could pose a
serious labor problem for some oilfield services companies because
of a lack of experienced oil workers, industry officials say.
   A shortage of offshore oil workers already has developed in
parts of the Gulf of Mexico, officials said, but that problem could
spread industrywide if drilling increases.
   Ocean Oil Weekly Report said Monday that some offshore companies
could double their work load if they could find enough skilled
workers. The shortage of qualified personnel is ``threatening to
hamper the slight surge in drilling activity,'' the newsletter said.
   The decline of oil prices in the early 1980s forced layoffs that
drove oil-field employees into other businesses, and the depressed
wages now offered in the oil industry are not big enough to draw
them back, said Jim Redden, editor of the newsletter.
   Some rig laborer jobs earned $11 per hour on offshore platforms
in the early 1980s, compared with the $7 per hour they now are
paid, according to Ed McGhee of the International Association of
Drilling Contractors. Bargemasters who made $48,000 per year now
are being paid about $30,000.
   Zapata Gulf Marine had to mothball a few of its 98 supply
vessels working in the Gulf because of a lack of sailors and
maritime engineers, Zapata spokesman Barney White said Monday.
   ``We're really having a manpower crunch,'' he said. ``Last
month, we had three boats that we couldn't work because we didn't
have crews.''
   Zapata's recruiters have been working to locate maritime
personnel, White said. The company has maintained enough workers
for its six Gulf rigs by recalling former employees who had worked
on the two dozen rigs it operated in the Gulf several years ago, he
said.
   Most offshore drilling companies have enough roustabouts, tool
pushers, drillers and roughnecks, said McGhee.
   But if drilling were to increase sharply, the need for labor
would be great, he said. Divers, mechanics, electricians, welders,
pipefitters and boat hands are in short supply, Redden said.

<HEAD>Survey: Exports Growing Among Young High-Tech Firms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Over the next decade, exports by young
high-technology companies could help reduce the national trade
deficit, according to economists who unveiled a new survey of such
firms.
   ``As we evolve into a technology-driven type manufacturer,
...these companies do start exporting shortly after they are
born,'' James M. Howell, Bank of Boston's chief economist, said
Tuesday. ``In this environment, they can be substantial
contributors to exports.''
   The bank's survey of nearly 400 firms nationwide indicated many
high-tech firms are exporting soon after formation and not
experiencing a significant competitive disadvantage.
   High-tech companies, which are concentrated on the two coasts,
will play a significant role in job growth in the next five years
and could make ``a fairly substantial contribution'' to reducing
the foreign trade deficit by the mid-1990s, Howell said.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday that the U.S. trade deficit
for June increased to $12.5 billion, a 28.5 percent increase over
May's $9.8 billion imbalance and the worst monthly figure since
February.
   The bank survey was mailed earlier this year to 6,539 companies
in the fields of biotechnology, advanced materials, photonic and
optics, automation and test and measurement.
   High-tech exporters formed during the 1980s with annual sales of
under $10 million have had about the same _ or in some cases faster
_ sales and employment growth rates as non-exporting firms, the
survey indicated.
   ``Most of the jobs in the country get created by young high-tech
companies growing up,'' Howell said. ``There's a difference between
a Digital (Equipment Corp.) growing up from the '50s to the '80s
and a corner drug store not growing at all.''
   The survey indicated sales increased by 50 percent and
employment by 23 percent among young export firms in the most
recent fiscal year, compared to 44 percent and 26 percent,
respectively, among non-exporting firms.
   Technology concentrations in the form of manufacturing firms and
research facilities are a major source of new development ``because
they serve as the spawning ground for entrepreneurs and as a
significant source of new products and processes,'' the survey said.
   The young exporters perceive Europe and Japan as their primary
sources of comptition, but in only one of the five fields did a
majority of companies think that competition is unfair. Sixty-seven
percent of test and measurement companies thought competition was
too stiff, compared to 22 percent in biotechnology and 18 percent
in photonic and optics.
   ``Gaining market share in a rapidly expanding global market is
viewed as being far more important than the fairness of the
marketplace,'' the survey said.
   `This finding strikes us as significant and suggests that the
current preoccupation with protectionism misses the mark,'' it
said. ``From a policy perspective, it will be more productive to
focus on the issue of creating a hospitable environment for
business starts.''

   The dollar rose against most major currencies in
moderately active European trading this morning, as bullish
sentiment overcame the effect of disappointing U.S. trade figures
for June.
   Gold prices fell.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the market was surprised by the
dollar's quick recovery from the effects of the announcement that
the trade gap widened to $12.5 billion in June from a revised $9.8
billion in May.
   They attributed the recovery to bullish sentiment created by
relatively high U.S. interest rates and the conviction that the
U.S. administration wants a strong dollar at the time of the
November presidential election.
   ``The firmer dollar seems to be politically motivated, as the
Republicans want to use it for their electoral campaign,'' said
Gerhard Sunderdiek, client manager at Bank of America in Frankfurt.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 0.07 yen to a closing 133.15 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 133.52 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8994 West German marks, up from 1.8705; 1.5973
Swiss francs, up from 1.5705; 6.4320 French francs, up from 6.3390;
2.1395 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1065; 1,406.35 Italian lire, up
from 1,384.50; 1.2295 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2275.
   In London, it cost $1.7000 to buy one pound, compared with
$1.7190 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $428.90 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $429. Both were down from Tuesday's late bid
of $431.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $428.85, down from $433 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid $431.31, down from
Tuesday's $434.21.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.61 a troy
ounce, down from Tuesday's $6.77.

   Share prices firmed on Tokyo's stock exchange
today, while the dollar edged up.
   After opening at 28,041.38, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a main barometer of the market, gained 282.31
points, or 1.01 percent, to close at 28,178.86 points.
   Total volume of both sections was 850 million shares, more than
three times as much as Tuesday's 260 million shares.
   Despite the $12.5 billion June U.S. trade deficit reported
Tuesday, share prices in New York, which stayed relatively high,
led the Tokyo market rebound, according to a stock dealer at a
major securities firm in Tokyo, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Another reason of the dramatic change in Tokyo is that most of
the dealers who had been on Bon holidays returned to business
today,'' he said.
   Bon is an annual holiday when Japanese pay homage to their
ancestors.
   Rising issues were those related to steel, heavy machines and
electricity, while some of the precision machines-related stocks
dipped, the dealer added.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar opened at 133.17 yen,
ranged between 133.00 yen and 133.35 yen before closing at 133.15
yen, up 0.07 yen from the previous day's close.
   Spot trading totaled $5.2560 billion, up from Tuesday's $3.1420
billion.

<HEAD>Japan Will Help Resolve Latin American Debt Problem, Foreign
Minister Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan plans to help Latin America resolve its
debt problem and is looking at ways to contribute to peace in
Central America, Japanese Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno said.
   Uno also announced his country would donate $9 million to build
and equip a Center for the Prevention of Seismic Disasters at the
National University of Mexico.
   Uno met for 40 minutes Tuesday with President Miguel de la
Madrid and for about an hour with Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, declared
winner of the July 6 elections by the Federal Election Commission.
   No details of the talks with de la Madrid were disclosed, but a
statement from the presidency said agreements on financing, foreign
debt, cooperation and trade, in addition to the seismic center,
would result from his visit.
   He and Salinas talked about improving political and economic
relations and cooperation between their two countries, among other
topics, a statement from the party said.
   Uno said Japan has ``recycled'' $1 billion of the $4 billion it
has destined for Latin America as part of its assistance to Third
World countries with debt problems.
   ``Japan has the firm intention of providing the greatest
collaboration it can'' to try to resolve the debt problem, he said.
   Uno, who arrived Monday for a four-day official visit to Mexico,
spoke at a commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Treaty on
Friendship and Trade between the two countries.
   ``Japan is willing to continue cooperating on select projects
that contribute to the increase in exports and the readjustment of
the economic structure of the debtor countries,'' he said.
   He said Japan ``is studying intensely'' how to aid in the
reconstruction and development of Central America and to help
refugees in the region.
   Once the earthquake center is built, Japan will begin
transferring seismic technology to Mexico, Central America and the
Caribbean will begin, he said.
   ``My country has never forgotten the valuable assistance it
received from Mexico in the great earthquake of Kanto in 1923,'' he
said. ``We belive that with the establishment of the center, we can
share knowledge and experiences, as countries belonging to the
Pacific Basin volcanic zone.''
   Uno and Mexican Foreign Minister Bernardo Sepulveda exchanged
diplomatic notes Tuesday formally agreeing to establish the center.
Negotiations on the center began in late 1985, after the disastrous
Sept. 19 earthquake in Mexico City and during a visit to Japan by
President Miguel de la Madrid.
   To be operated by various Mexican government departments, the
center will be involved in research, training and distribution of
information, the Foreign Ministry said. It is to have equipment for
observation and measurement of geological phenomenon, risk
evaluation and processing of seismic data to provide the
information needed to set up public prevention and assistance
programs.

<HEAD>Insurer Agrees to Merger Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers Insurance Group Inc. agreed to
discuss a $4.9 billion buyout offer from Batus Inc., but warned it
still has reservations about the proposed friendly merger.
   On a separate front in the eight-month takeover battle, the
insurer vowed to appeal a ruling by regulators in Illinois Tuesday
giving a tentative green light to a Farmers-Batus merger in that
state.
   Farmers' offer to negotiate was the first significant easing of
the company's opposition to a buyout by Batus, a Louisville,
Ky.-based tobacco and retailing company.
   Despite the offer of negotiations, Farmers has a number of
objections to a merger, said Leo E. Denlea Jr., Farmers' chairman
and chief executive.
   ``Farmers' board of directors has made no decision concerning a
sale of the company,'' Denlea said in a news release. ``...We will
have to address the issues being raised in the insurance regulatory
hearings, and the concerns of our insurance exchanges, in a
comprehensive fashion if there is to be any prospect for a
transaction.''
   A Batus spokesman said the company had no immediate comment but
was preparing a statement.
   Batus, a subisidiary of BAT Industries PLC of Britain, is
seeking to acquire Farmers to gain a foothold in the American
financial services business. Farmers is the nation's third biggest
auto and home insurer and seventh biggest property and casualty
insurer.
   Top management of Farmers declined to negotiate after Batus
announced its initial proposal early this year, and Batus took its
offer directly to shareholders with a cash tender offer.
   That offer now stands at $63 a share, or about $4.4 billion.
Last week, Batus announced it would be willing to pay $72 a share
for the company if Farmers' management agreed to back the bid.
   It was the latter proposal, which values the company at
approximately $4.9 billion, that won Farmers' agreement to
negotiate.
   Farmers has contested Batus' overtures in mailings to
shareholders, in court, and in hearings before insurance regulators
in nine states where authorities must approve such a merger.
   On Tuesday, the Illinois Department of Insurance approved a
takeover by Batus as long as the company agreed to maintain
Farmers' fees and various lines of insurance, and to continue
non-smoker discounts. Batus spokesman Wilson Wyatt said the company
has already agreed to meet those conditions.
   A Farmers spokesman said the company intended to appeal the
decision.
   In the various insurance hearings, Farmers, noting Batus owns
the company that makes Kool and Viceroy cigarettes, has suggested a
buyout could bring an end to the company's insurance discounts for
non-smokers. Though Batus officials have maintained they would do
no such thing, Farmers' representatives have suggested an insurer
owned by Batus would de-emphasize anti-smoking policies and
advertisements.
   Ohio regulators have approved the merger with conditions similar
to those made by Illinois, and Arizona regulators also approved the
deal. Idaho, Washington and Oregon have rejected it and decisions
or hearings are pending in Texas and Kansas. California regulators
rejected the merger, but that decision was overturned by a state
court.
   Most of the decisions are in various stages of appeal.
   Farmers has 68.4 million shares outstanding, and employees hold
options to buy an additional 1.5 million new shares, bringing the
total of shares likely to be bought in an unfriendly takeover to
69.9 million.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices were mixed in lackluster trading at
midday Wednesday, with the market's near-term outlook clouded by
concerns about Britain's economy.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 2.9
points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,828.2 at about 12:30 p.m.
   Among the top 100 shares, 37 were higher, 34 were lower and 29
were unchanged.
   Volume was thin, with 171.3 million shares changing hands by
midday compared with 168.8 million shares at the same time Tuesday.
   Most shares languished in morning dealings, with activity
concentrated on a few, selected shares.
   Underlying the market's reticence to trade are concerns about
possible overheating in the British economy, highlighted by a
report by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.
The report warned of ``renewed inflationary pressures'' in the
British economy.
   Many players suspect the market isn't going anywhere until these
fears about inflation are eased, dealers said.
   Volumes also were depressed as players remained a bit perplexed
by the market's rally late Tuesday, which came despite
worse-than-expected U.S. trade figures.
   ``Quite a few people were caught out by yesterday afternoon's
move,'' said one equity salesman.

<HEAD>Last Fiero Rolls Off Line In Pontiac</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last Pontiac produced in Pontiac by
General Motors Corp. has rolled of the assembly line, ending more
than 60 years of auto production in this city which lent its name
to the automobile.
   The last two sporty Fieros produced at the plant Tuesday were
turned over to two workers who won raffles. They were among the
1,400 Group employees placed on indefinite layoff with the plant
closing.
   As the last Fieros moved off the line, workers were hoping
transfer slips would be awaiting them when they got home.
   ``It'll be there,'' said utility worker Otto Hardwig, 38, of
Oxford. ``If not, I'll do dishes or sweep floors.''
   ``I'd gladly return the car to get my job back,'' said Mike
Kelley, a truck driver at the plant who won the two-seat vehicle
that was discontinued due to slow sales.
   More than 370,000 cars had been built since they were introduced
in the 1984 model year. The last vehicles came off the production
line about 10:30 a.m. Tuesday.
   ``My father had seven sons who have over 100 years in this
place,'' said Daniel Lemaster, 51. ``All that service ... now
this.''
   Though some GM trucks and engines still are built in Pontiac,
cars named for the city will be built in factories in eight other
cities, including Lansing and Ypsilanti.
   The shutdown is the latest in a series of plant closings and
cutbacks at the complex. A rear-wheel-drive assembly line and a
foundry were closed last year.
   In an effort to comply with terms of its 1987 labor pact with
the United Auto Workers prohibiting plant closings, GM listed the
shutdown as an ``idling,'' implying the plant might reopen.
   The automaker, however, has made no plans at this point that
would pump new life into the old factory, which dates back to 1925
when the old Fisher Body Co. originally erected the building.
   The Fiero initially was a hit with consumers, but by mid-1985
sales went into a long, slow decline that never reversed. The slide
was intensified by a shift in consumer preferences away from
two-seaters.
   Workers at the plant were praised by the company for their
efforts in refining the team concept and creativity in improving
productivity.
   ``General Motors is pretty pleased with the contributions the
Fiero team and Fiero plant made to GM. It will have a lasting
impact on GM,'' said GM spokeswoman Kathy Tanner.
   Layoffs at the Fiero plant began last week and will be completed
by Sept. 15, GM officials said.
   Once the shutdown is complete, about 50 hourly workers will
remain at the Fiero plant to tend the idled machinery and take care
of other jobs related to the plant's idling, the automaker said.

<HEAD>Cable Sports Network To Pay Higher Rights Fees In Gretsky Deal</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also filed on sports wire</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A regional sports network controlled by Denver
cable-TV magnate Bill Daniels will pay $2.4 million in higher
rights fees as part of the deal that lured hockey superstar Wayne
Gretzky to Los Angeles from the Edmonton Oilers.
   The L.A.-based Prime Ticket network paid the higher prices -- an
increase of $600,000 over four years -- because of the
contributions the star player could make to the network and the Los
Angeles Kings hockey team.
   Daniels said in an interview with the Rocky Mountain News
Tuesday that Bruce McNall, the team's owner, approached him before
the deal to talk about the money that would be needed to sign
Gretzky.
   ``Bruce came to me and said, `Would you raise your rights fees
on the Kings games so that I can come up with the amount of money
we have to come up with to get Gretzky?''' Daniels said. ``My
answer was, `You're damn right.'''
   The increased fees, Daniels said, will be paid only as long as
Gretzky plays for the Kings. The hockey star has a four-year
contract.
   Prime Ticket also agreed to triple the amount of money spent on
promoting and advertising the Kings broadcasts, Daniels said.
   The complicated Gretzky deal is expected to benefit Prime
Ticket, which has an exclusive contract to televise Kings games in
southern California, Arizona, Nevada and Hawaii.
   ``It pleases our affiliates, we'll gain more affiliates and we
can considerably increase the advertising dollars we charge,'
Daniels said.
   Prime Ticket, which also is owned by Jerry Buss, the principal
owner of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, is one of several
companies launching a regional sports network in Denver.
   The venture already has signed a deal with the Denver Nuggets to
telecast a number of regular-season and playoff games.
   As part of the Gretzky deal, Prime Ticket agreed to a
significant increase in coverage of Kings games -- from 37 to 60 a
year, said Tony Acone, the network's president.

<HEAD>Maxicare Withdraws From Utah, Leaves 20,000 Subscribers Uninsured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maxicare of Utah Inc. has announced it has
withdrawn from Utah, leaving its 20,000 health-care subscribers
uninsured.
   The announcement was made at a news conference Tuesday at which
officials of the health-maintenance organization said they were
ceasing immediately all health-care coverage in Utah.
   Harold C. Yancey, state commissioner of insurance, said he hoped
health care providers would honor Maxicare contracts until the
state can come up with a solution to the vacuum left by Maxicare's
sudden departure.
   Maxicare of Utah, which operated under the national corporate
umbrella of Maxicare Health Plans, opened its Utah operation in
January 1984.
   Yancey characterized Maxicare of Utah Inc. as being in an
``insolvent situation.''
   He said Utah officials will meet with 10 other health
maintenance organizations doing business in the state in the hope
that one or more will be able to cover Maxicare contracts.
   ``We're still holding meetings in the department to try and find
some coverage for all of the enrollees in Maxicare,'' Yancey said.
   ``We hope providers will continue to see their patients and
honor the agreements with Maxicare,'' the commissioner said. ``The
health providers are going to have to make a business decision....
(But) their claims may or may not be paid.''
   Yancey said state officials became aware of Maxicare's problems
last spring when a state financial examination of 1987 records
revealed the health maintenance organization was in trouble.
   He said the parent company had hoped eventually that the company
would be able to turn a profit in Utah.
   Maxicare's losses and the misfortune of other health maintenance
organizations in Utah are part of a nationwide problem, Yancey
said. ``It is not a unique Utah problem. HMOs all over the U.S. are
in dire trouble,'' he said.
   He said factors making it difficult for HMOs to make money
include escalating medical costs, exotic new treatments that are
costly, inadequate premiums and subscribers taking record numbers
of trips to the doctor.
   ``The customers are taking more advantage of their health care
than ever before,'' Yancey said.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French government, meeting at Cabinet level for
the first time since July 17, noted its ``extreme irritation''
Wednesday at the trade bill passed by the U.S. Congress.
   Government spokesman Claude Evin, speaking after the meeting,
said both President Francois Mitterrand and Premier Michel Rocard
manifested their irritation and accused the United States of
creating a new policy ``without international consultation.''
   ``France will not just limit itself to verbal condemnations,''
Evin said. ``The French ministers concerned (by the trade bill)
will have the occasion to examine the consequences of the decisions
taken in the United States.''
   The spokesman refused to discuss possible retaliatory measures.
He said the minister of agriculture was ``particularly concerned''
by the bill and noted that the Common Market has already termed it
protectionist.
   Among other things, the bill focuses unfair-trade investigations
on countries with consistent patterns of unfair trade practices.

<TEXT>
   Coherent Inc. has entered an agreement
that will end its status as one of the last holdouts in a
protracted patent fight over who invented the laser, the company
said.
   The Palo Alto-based company said Tuesday it will pay tiny Patlex
Corp., of Chatsworth, Calif., license fees on the sale of most of
Coherent's lasers.
   The agreement leaves Spectra-Physics Inc., of San Jose, as the
last major laser maker refusing to pay fees to Patlex.
   Patlex is headed by former Apollo astronaut and former Eastern
Airlines Chairman Frank Borman.
   The agreement with Patlex covers gas discharge lasers made by
Coherent, and it protects Coherent's customers from patent
infringement action by Patlex.
   Patlex, which would not disclose the terms of the agreement, has
asked for a 5 percent royalty from most laser makers.
   Coherent and Spectra-Physics are two of the world's leading
manufacturers of lasers.
   Patlex is a small laser company that has a 64 percent interest
in licensing income from patents it has secured over the years for
inventor Gordon Gould. Gould came up with a design for a laser in
the 1950s while he was a graduate student at Columbia University.
But much of the credit for the invention has gone to Charles
Townes, a former physics professor at Columbia who was a consultant
to Bell Laboratories, and Arthur Schawlow, then a Bell Laboratories
scientist.
   In October, the U.S. Patent Office gave Gould a patent for the
invention of the gas discharge laser.

<HEAD>GTECH Signs Contract To Expand In Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GTECH Corp., the world's largest lottery
concern, has signed a five-year contract with Mexico to triple the
size of its lottery operation there.
   The contract calls for the company to add 1,000 sales terminals
to Mexico's 500-terminal network, allowing the operation to expand
beyond Mexico City's borders.
   ``We hope this (recent contract) is just the first expansion
phase,'' said Victor Markowicz, GTECH's senior vice president of
international sales.
   GTECH would not comment on the contract's worth, citing
competitive considerations and a desire ``to protect customers'
proprietary information,'' he said.
   The existing contract generates annual revenues of $2 million to
$3 million, according to Cato Carpenter, an analyst with the
Baltimore-based Alex Brown & Sons.
   GTECH has disclosed the worth of other foreign contracts,
including Spain, $5 million to $10 million a year; Ontario, Canada,
$10 million; Sweden, just under $4 million and Australia, $4
million. GTECH also has contracts in Iceland and Ireland, but has
not disclosed their worth.
   The extra terminals will allow Pronosticos Deportivos para la
Asistencia Publica, which operates the Mexican lottery, to expand
to Guadalajara and other, still undertermined, cities, said
Markowicz.
   When GTECH installed its computer terminals in Mexico in June,
1987, it marked the first time Mexico's Lotto game had been
automated. About 20 percent of Mexican Lotto agents are outfitted
with GTECH terminals, said Markowicz. GTECH's terminals account for
about half of all Lotto sales in Mexico, he said.
   ``The growth of the game is highly attributable to our
terminals,''he said. ``We expect Mexico to absorb many more
terminals.''
   Mexico leases the terminals with the intention of purchasing
them at the end of each contract period. A Mexican subcontractor
operates the terminals.

Libertyville, Ill.
   It plans to hire 5,000 workers at its headquarters and eight
plants in the United States, Canada and Brazil, Matsumura said.
   The company will begin operations on September 1, he said.
   ``It is part of our stragedy of globalization,'' Matsumura said.
``We have been aiming to set up a world-wide sales and production
network.''
   Matsumura also said the joint venture will help Komatsu minimize
the effects of exchange rate fluctuations.
   Total assets of the new company will be about $400 million, and
it hopes to generate sales of $1.5 billion the first year, the
spokesman said.

   Objections by directors to some proposed changes
on the General Motors Corp. board and a retreat by Chairman Roger
B. Smith may show the auto company's management that board approval
can no longer be taken for granted.
   Smith was startled at a recent board meeting when outside
directors protested changes that would affect the makeup of the
board and stood their ground, The Wall Street Journal reported
today.
   GM's board ``isn't undercutting management,'' the newspaper
quoted a source close to the board as saying. ``But there's a
feeling that perhaps (the board) wasn't as involved in some past
decisions as it should have been.''
   One director was quoted as saying, ``There's no doubt that the
board has a sense of wanting to be less spoken to and more
consulted with. ... We are getting a little more ventilation in a
place where the windows haven't been open.''
   The discussion at the board's June 27 meeting did not involve a
major strategic decision for the company.
   Following a decision by Elmer W. Johnson, an executive vice
president and board member, to resign, Smith proposed a series of
executive changes.
   He wanted to name William E. Hoglund, Robert T. O'Connell and
John F. Smith Jr. as executive vice presidents and place them on
the board, as had been customary for executive vice presidents.
   But outside board members objected to replacing one inside
director with three, which would give management eight of 20 seats,
or 40 percent of the votes, rather than six of 18, or 33 percent.
   A compromise was worked out in which the three will sit at the
board table but without full director status.
   The original proposal never came to a vote. ``Roger's smart. He
can count,'' one director told the newspaper.
   Smith said Tuesday it would be improper to discuss the meeting,
but maintained the outside directors have long been active and
independent.
   ``I don't think they're more questioning or critical now than a
year ago,'' Smith said.
   GM President Robert Stempel, an inside director, acknowledged
plenty of discussion at the meeting, though he said, ``I don't want
to use the word `disagreement.' Our outside board members always
offer us counsel. They certainly in this matter have given us
copious advice.''
   Automatic support for management began to falter in 1984, when
GM acquired Electronic Data Systems Corp. and put its founder, H.
Ross Perot, on the board. Perot voted no the following year when GM
decided to acquire Hughes Aircraft Co.
   One possible area of increasing board involvement is the
question of tying executive pay more closely to results, which some
directors advocate.
   Another looming question is management succession, with Vice
Chairman Donald J. Atwood, who oversees GM's high-tech
subsidiaries, retiring next year and Smith scheduled to step down
in July 1990.
   Some directors said an atmosphere encouraging free discussion
was strengthened by the 1982 appointment of John G. Smale,
innovative chairman of Procter & Gamble Co., to the board, and the
1986 appointment of James D. Robinson III, chairman of American
Express Co.

<HEAD>Official Recommends DOT Reconsider United Route Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top official of the U.S. Department of
Transportation has ordered a lower level official of the department
to reconsider a recommendation that American Airlines replace
United Airlines on the lucrative Seattle-Tokyo route.
   Chicago-based United, the nation's largest airline, expressed
confidence Tuesday that the department will reverse the
recommendation on the trans-Pacific route which United has flown
since 1983.
   United became a major player in the Far East market in 1985
after acquiring Pan Am Corp.'s Pacific routes for $715 million in
what was then the largest airline route deal in history.
   But in April, DOT officials argued that United had diverted much
of its Tokyo traffic around Seattle to San Francisco and Los
Angeles. The department also said Fort Worth-based American has a
better financial base and its traffic pattern from the Midwest
would better serve the Seattle base.
   United has been flying the route since 1983, but its service is
under review as a condition of government approval of its purchase
of Pan Am's Pacific routes.
   ``Taking the route away from United, which has served it
faithfully for more than five years, is not in the best interests
of the United States and does not make sense,'' said United
Chairman Stephen M. Wolf.
   Wolf's remarks Tuesday came one day after Richard Walsh,
director of DOT's Office of Economics, recommended the route shift
from United to American, the second-largest U.S. carrier.
   Assistant Transportation Secretary Matthew Scocozza instructed
Walsh to review his recommendation in advance of the department's
final decision, expected in mid-September.
   Walsh's recommendation also contradicted a June 10 finding by
Administrative Law Judge Burton Kolko that United should retain the
route.
   American welcomed Walsh's recommendation.
   ``Obviously we're excited and delighted at the recommendation,''
said Al Becker, a spokesman for American. ``We think that we have
made the strongest case for the route.''
   Becker said American would spend ``many millions of dollars''
expanding its operation at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to
1,700 employees, and would pump $400 million into the Seattle
economy annually if it won the route.
   The Seattle-Tokyo route is viewed by the airline industry as one
of the most prized in the expanding Pacific travel market.
   Northwest Airlines is the only other U.S. carrier allowed by
Japan to fly the route in competition with Japan Air Lines.
   The Japanese Ministry of Transport last year set a goal of
doubling the number of outbound Japanese travelers to 10 million by
1991. Many are expected to choose Seattle as their first U.S.
destination.

<DATELINE>WEST BLOOMFIELD, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jane E. Smitt prefers being known
as a residential organizer than Michigan's ``closet queen.''
   But no matter how she describes it, what Smitt does for a living
is make big bucks by arranging wealthy people's closets.
   At least, they start out as closets. She turns them into
fabulous ``spaces behind doors'' that can turn even the worst slob
into an organized fashion plate.
   Except while she's at it, she gets rid of the closet doors.
   ``My premise is that you should be able to see everything you
have, it should all be out in the open,'' Smitt said.
   Nothing is strewn on the floor in Smitt's own closet, which is
more like an entire room in her West Bloomfield home. Nothing is
hidden in even the remotest of corners and clothes are not so
crammed that they come out wrinkled. There are nooks to stash
purses and crannies to hang belts, long spaces for dresses and
pants, shorter spaces for T-shirts and skirts and little drawers
for underwear and socks.
   On top of all that, the clothes are color coordinated by season,
black to white and cotton to wool.
   Even her 75 pairs of shoes have a place _ ``Most of my clients
have about 125 pairs,'' she adds in a futile attempt not to appear
excessive.
   Indeed, there's a place for everything. And she doesn't have to
ask her clients to get rid of anything.
   ``I can't stretch walls, but I generally can double and
sometimes triple the space in a closet,'' she said. ``My goal is to
make everything visible and to make it more functional. My business
is so custom. Some of my clients let me open all the doors, some
people don't. Some people store a case of toilet paper, some people
buy four (rolls) at a time.
   ``The key is listening to them just to find out about their
lifestyles and know how they live. Then you can better direct them
and better advise them.
   ``Like if you know a guy isn't going to walk a few steps to put
a shirt in the laundry, you need to know that so he doesn't end up
in the same situation he's already in. Or maybe the mirror needs to
go right near the tie rack, otherwise he's going to walk out with
his tie crooked.''
   Her clients are equally serious about the business.
   ``Before, when I wanted to wear something, I didn't know which
closet it was in,'' said Adria Aronovitz, who used to have to
disperse her garments in three closets throughout her home.
Aronovitz's son moved out and Smitt converted his room into a
closet.
   Now Aronovitz, who sells jewelry from her home, loves her closet
so much she treats it like a showcase, bringing guests in to see it.
   ``It is easier now. I just love it. It makes such a big
difference,'' she said. ``I spend a lot of time in there.''
   Smitt's designs reduce junk collecting and disorder because
there's a specific place for everything. High heels won't fit in a
slot for tennis shoes, and a dress will not fit in a shorter space
intended for a skirt. The compartments are all adjustable to allow
for inevitable fashion changes. Smitt even provides pullout hooks
for unused hangars.
   Smitt, 35, has charged from $250 to redo an existing closet _ it
takes two weeks if drawers aren't needed _ to $15,000 for all the
closets in a Birmingham home she began work on before it was built
_ that took a year and a half. Single closets range from $250 for a
5-foot lineal closet to $6,000 for a 15-foot-by-18-foot room.
   Her price includes her design fee, materials, aesthetics, belt
and tie racks, hooks and any other gadgets she needs to make the
closet fit the customer. Some ask for shoe shiners, pant steamers
or a space to pack suitcases.
   Smitt confesses she didn't always have a tidy room, but she was
the type of child who felt she had better things to do than listen
to her teachers during school.
   ``I loved to organize my pencil drawers. I used to take all the
pencils out of the drawer and put them back in. And when I went
home, I'd take everything out of my looseleafs and make it really
organized,'' she said. ``Still today, I like making the silverware
drawer stacked in neat piles _ I like to do it.
   ``It just became a natural. I love it. I love what I do.''
   Smitt said she earned a college degree at the request of her
father, but she never really found her niche in life until she
started working in kitchen sales. Her business developed from that.
   She has been in business for herself about six years, and now
employs an accountant and a part-time assistant who helps with
designs. She says she has never advertised _ she relies on
word-of-mouth by happy clients.
   Smitt organizes all ``spaces behind doors,'' including linen
closets and kitchen pantries. She's even done a yacht.
   Her service is not unique, she has competition in the nearby
affluent Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe and she's a member of the
Los Angeles-based National Association of Professional Organizers.
But Smitt says she's one of the few organizers who will return
after the design is complete and the carpenter is finished to hang
up each piece of clothing.
   ``You have to give them order in their life, and if you give
people order, then generally they can maintain it,'' Smitt said.

<HEAD>Computer Giant Reports Earnings Rise 30 Percent In Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer giant Hewlett-Packard Co. said
today its profits rose 30 percent in the third quarter, aided by
record orders for its electronics instruments.
   For the period ended July 31, the company reported after-tax
profits of $192 million, or 80 cents a share, up from $148 million,
or 57 cents a share, in the same period last year.
   Hewlett-Packard, the largest producer of electronic instruments
in the world, said its net revenue during the period rose 19
percent to $2.434 billion.
   Company president John A. Young noted the effort needed to match
the record high level of orders taken in the third quarter last
year.
   ``We met that challenge,'' he said. ``In fact, we set new
quarterly records for U.S. orders and for total orders.''
   For the nine months ending July 31, the company's net revenue
was up 23 percent to $7.122 billion, or $2.33 cents a share,
compared with $5.811 billion, or $1.65 a share, for the same period
in 1987.
   Orders for the nine-month period were $7.454 billion, up 19
percent from the $6.246 billion of a year ago.

<HEAD>United Technologies Warns Shareholders on Defense Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investigation of alleged fraud in
government defense contracts could harm the business United
Technologies Corp. does with the military, the company has told its
shareholders.
   United Technologies, which does about $4 billion worth of
business each year with the Defense Department, made the suggestion
in an Aug. 12 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The company, based in Hartford, is one of about three dozen U.S.
defense contractors searched by federal agents investigating the
fraud allegations.
   ``If the corporation were charged with wrongdoing as a result of
the investigation, the corporation or its units could be suspended
as a government contractor,'' United Technologies said in its SEC
filing.
   The filing was made after the SEC warned companies under
investigation of their obligation to inform shareholders of
developments that might affect the companies' finances.
   United Technologies said in its filing that some of its
operating units were searched and received grand jury subpoenas in
the case. No one has been charged with wrongdoing.
   Also noted in the filing is that the investigation into
procurement practices has prompted the Defense Department to
require two United Technologies subsidiaries, Pratt & Whitney and
Norden Systems, to sign ``certification of business integrity''
when bidding on future government contracts.
   United Technologies and other defense contractors are seeking a
modification of the directive, which asks them to affirm they have
not obtained confidential bidding information.
   According to the SEC filing, the investigation and certification
requirement and the uncertainty they are creating in the defense
industry ``may adversely affect the corporation's ability to obtain
government business.''
   United Technologies spokeswoman Peg Hashem said Tuesday the
company thought the filing was ``appropriate'' because of the SEC's
advisory and the Defense Department's certification requirement.
   Charles Larson, a spokesman for the SEC in Washington, said the
commission didn't specifically request United Technologies to make
its filing in its standard financial document, called a Form 10-Q.
   ``I think some of the contractors are responding to our
statement that publicly traded companies have the responsibility to
put out full and timely information about the investigation,''
Larson said.
   Northrop Corp. of Los Angeles, another target of the Pentagon
investigation, also has made two public disclosures to its
shareholders through SEC filings. Larson said the SEC is not
keeping track of which other defense contractors have made similar
filings.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Mostly Lower On Slack Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crop futures opened mostly lower today on the
Chicago Board of Trade as the market registered disappointment in
the slack global demand for U.S. grains and soybean products.
   With the end of the growing season approaching, the focus of
grain and soybean traders is gradually shifting from weather to
demand concerns, especially in exports, analysts said.
   In the corn market, which has recently been the leader among the
crop futures, ``there is very little near-term demand and nothing
to hold it in the short run,'' said Cathy Leow, a grain trader for
Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   The approaching corn harvest traditionally brings lower corn
prices, she said, adding, ``I just look for the softness to
continue.''
   Cooler temperatures and showers were expected to reach the
drought-stricken Corn Belt on Thursday, which should give the
struggling soybean crop a break from record-setting heat.
   Wheat futures weakened on news the Agriculture Department had
rejected Egypt's bid for 250,000 metric tons of subsidized wheat.
   In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.87{ a bushel; corn was 3{
cents to 5 cents lower with September at $2.82 a bushel; oats were
3 cents to 5{ cents lower with September at $2.74{ a bushel;
soybeans were 10 cents to 13 cents lower with August at $8.53 a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .17 cent to .40 cent higher with August at
70.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to .20 cent
higher with August at 81.85 cents a pound; hogs were .27 cent lower
to .28 cent higher with August at 46.90 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were unchanged to .70 cent higher with August at 34.40
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Tuesday while pork futures were
mostly lower.

   A federal judge was urged today to block the
partial merger of Detroit's daily newspapers by a lawyer who
contended that former Attorney General Edwin Meese III ignored the
law in approving the deal.
   William Schultz, representing Michigan Citizens for an
Independent Press, argued that neither the Detroit Free Press nor
the Detroit News could qualify as ``failing newspapers'' under the
law that allows joint operating agreements of dailies in the same
city.
   ``You have a situation where the two competing newspapers are in
a struggle for control and it's not at all clear who is going to
win,'' Schultz told U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green at a
hearing on his group's bid for a temporary restraining order.
   The two newspapers are scheduled to combine their commercial and
production facilities Thursday under a joint operating agreement
approved last week by Meese before he left office.
   The News, which is owned by Gannett Co., Inc., and the Free
Press, owned by Knight-Ridder, Inc., will maintain separate
editorial staffs but publish joint editions on weekends.
   The News, now a 24-hour paper, will publish evening editions
during the week.
   Schultz said Meese ignored an administrative law judge's finding
that neither paper was in danger of financial collapse. The
administrative law judge recommended against approval of the joint
operating agreement under an anti-trust exemption provided by the
Newspaper Preservation Act.
   Philip Lacovara, representing Knight-Ridder, said the partial
merger ``is the only solution to a bad situation.''
   Although the merger will result in 500 layoffs, 1,500 jobs would
be lost in Detroit if the Free Press closed its doors, Lacovara
said. Knight-Ridder had threatened to close the paper, which has
lost $56.2 million since 1980, if the joint operating agreement
were not approved.
   ``The Free Press cannot survive, cannot become profitable so
long as it is in commercial competition with the News,'' Lacovara
told the judge, who reserved decision on the injunction.
   ``The Free Press has no unilateral way out, the competitive
situation is such that it can't get in the black by unilaterally
raising its prices,'' Lacovara said.
   The plaintiffs, who include advertisers, a state senator, and
one part-time printer who was told he would no longer have a job
under the joint operating agreement, have also filed suit for a
permanent injunction against the merger.
   The suit filed Tuesday charged that Meese's order allowing the
joint operating agreement ``is arbitrary and capricious, contrary
to law, and not supported by substantial evidence'' that either
daily qualified as a ``failing newspaper'' under the Newspaper
Preservation Act.
   The merger ``will remove the beneficial effects of competition
on the quality (in terms of editorial coverage, diversity, and news
reporting) and is likely to cause a rise in the prices of
newspapers in the Detroit areas,'' the complaint said.
   The suit also said the combined operation will result in
increased advertising rates.
   The plaintiffs say Meese violated Justice Department regulations
by meeting with members of Michigan's congressional delegation in
June to discuss the newspaper merger.
   The lawsuit contends that Meese ignored recommendations by
Morton Needelman, the administrative law judge, that the losses by
both newspapers were the result of a marketing strategy designed to
drive the competition out of business or force creation of a joint
operating agreement.
   Needelman also found that the Free Press was not in a ``downward
spiral'' financially nor was it dominated by the News.
   The plaintiffs include Democratic State Sen. John F. Kelly and
Public Citizen, a consumer lobby organization founded by Ralph
Nader. Also joining the suit were W. Edward Wendover, a journalism
professor and publisher of the weekly Plymouth-Canton Community
Crier, and David A. Kersh, president of Metro Publications, Inc.,
which sells coupon books and advertises in the News.

   Housing construction climbed 2.4 percent in July, the government
said today, but a companion report indicated that higher mortgage
rates may stifle the construction business in coming months.
   Building permits for future construction fell 5.4 percent, the
biggest decline since a 9 percent fall in January, the Commerce
Department said. Analysts said higher borrowing costs could be
discouraging the market.
   The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were being
built at an annual rate of 1.49 million units in July. It was the
second consecutive monthly increase following a 4.4 percent rise in
June.
   Stocks weakened today after a higher opening, but brokers said
the market signaled no clear direction. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks, which partly recovered Tuesday from a
three-month low, was higher during much of the morning before
retreating and was down 5.68 points to 2,015.83 by noon EDT.
   On Tuesday, stocks, bonds and the dollar rose in spite of a
government report that the nation's merchandise trade deficit
widened to $12.5 billion in June.
   Tuesday's report caught the market off guard and hurt prices at
first, but investors eventually found reasons to be content with
the biggest trade gap since February.
   Investors also failed to be unnerved by a Federal Reserve report
that American industry operated at 83.5 percent of capacity in
July. That was the highest operating level in eight years, and
could be an indicator of rising inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 17.24 to
2,021.51 on Tuesday, recovering about half the loss it sustained
Monday in falling to a three-month low.
   The dollar, which lost more than 1 percent of its value right
after the trade report, finished the day with half-percentage point
gains against the British pound, West German mark and Japanese yen.
   Bond prices strengthened after morning losses, with the yield on
the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond dipping to 9.40 percent from
9.43 percent late Monday.
   The market's reaction was far more positive than in April, when
the Commerce Department's report of a $14.4 billion February
deficit contributed to a 101.46-point drop in the Dow Jones
industrial average.
   ``Basically, the trade number wasn't bad. It may not have been
spectacular, but it was quite all right,'' said Arnold Moskowitz,
senior vice president and economist for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Moskowitz said the deficit was not far above expectations
considering the wide fluctuations that are typical. And he said
some of the record imports that swelled the June deficit probably
should have been recorded in May, when the deficit was unexpectedly
low.
   Investors also were impressed with an upward revision in May
exports, which led to a reduction in the May deficit to $9.8
billion from $10.9 billion.
   The factory use report added to concerns that the economy is
overheating. But Moskowitz said recent Fed moves to raise interest
rates are beginning to cool off consumer spending, leaving slack
for export-driven industries to continue their expansion.
   ``This one-month jump in the trade deficit is not cause for
alarm,'' U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a
statement. ``Monthly numbers will always be erratic and it is more
instructive to focus on the long-term outlook.''
   Exports fell by 2.4 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted
$26.8 billion while imports surged to an all-time high of $39.4
billion.
   Even with the deterioration, the U.S. trade deficit for the
first six months of the year was running at an annual rate of $140
billion, down sharply from the record deficit of $170.3 billion set
in 1987.

   The U.S. Justice Department is investigating
defense contracts awarded two General Motors Corp. subsidiaries, GM
has told the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   GM said in reports filed this week with the SEC that contracts
with its Electronic Data Systems Corp. and Hughes Aircraft Co. are
under investigation, according to GM spokesman Terry Sullivan.
   Publicly traded corporations are required to make such reports
to the SEC if they face potential liability.
   Roger Still, an EDS spokesman, said federal investigators are
probing allegations that some companies may have used secret
information supplied by consultants to win key contracts.
   But Still said federal attorneys have told EDS neither it nor
any of its employees are suspected of criminal activity.
   Hal Watkins, a Hughes Aircraft spokesman, said a federal grand
jury in Birmingham, Ala., is investigating charges that Hughes
employees did not furnish the Defense Department with all of the
information required by the federal government's truth in
contracting law in connection with a 1983 contract.
   Hughes' position is that neither it nor any of its employees
violated any law, Watkins said.

   More than a year after the United States slapped
penalty tariffs on Japan for allegedly violating an agreement on
semiconductor trade, Japanese officials are stepping up pressure on
Washington to remove the penalties before President Reagan leaves
office.
   U.S. officials counter that the Japanese government continues to
renege on a pledge to boost the market share of imported U.S. chips.
   The $300ffs, since reduced to $165 million, were
the strongest trade retaliation the United States has taken against
Japan since World million in tari War II.
   ``The problem remains of a lack of market access,'' said a
senior U.S. trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``There is a certain goal, and the Japanese side is not living up
to it.''
   The Japanese claim sales of American semiconductors here soared
75 percent in the first quarter of this year over the same period
last year.
   ``I don't know any people who are so greedy that they're not
satisfied with a 75 percent increase in one year,'' Makoto Kuroda,
ex-vice minister of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, told journalists this month.
   MITI chief Hajime Tamura has urged U.S. Trade Representative
Clayton Yeutter to lift the sanctions before the end of the Reagan
admiStates isn't in danger of being dethroned as
the world's soybean king, but the royal attire is a bit ragged. And
some other countries that produce oilseed crops stand to make a
little profit.
   Based on Aug. 1 indications, the Agriculture Department
estimates the 1988 soybean harvest at 1.47 billion bushels, or 23
percent less than last year's production. The yield was put at 26
bushels per acre, compared with 33.7 in 1987.
   Two years ago, according to USDA economists, soybeans brought
farmers an average of $4.78 per bushel. In the 1987-88 marketing
year that runs through the end of August, prices are expected to
average $6.20 per bushel.
   Even before the drought was fully developed this summer, it was
apparent that the U.S. soybean supply was running low and that
demand would boost prices. In June, USDA forecast bean prices in
1988-89 _ the year that will begin on Sept. 1 _ would be in the
range of $5.75 to $7.75 per bushel.
   In July, after the fierce heat and drought spread deep into corn
and soybean areas, the USDA upped the price forecast to $6.75 to
$9.25 per bushel.
   The August analysis put the 1988-89 soybean price range at $7.25
to $9.75 per bushel.
   When the new marketing year begins Sept. 1, the U.S. soybean
stockpile is expected to be about 280 million bushels, down from
436 million a year ago. By this time next year, the bean reserve
may be 100 million bushels or less, according to the USDA
projections.
   An updated crop report and analysis of the supply-demand
situation, along with new price forecasts, will be issued by the
department on Sept. 12. Hot, dry weather during the soybean plants'
critical flowering stage since Aug. 1 has caused concern that
harvest prospects have continued to decline.
   Meanwhile, the soybean's international importance as an oilseed
continues to come under scrutiny by USDA experts. Other sources of
vegetable oil and protein meal, such as rapeseed, cottonseed and
other crops also are drawing close attention.
   Overall, based on August indications, the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service estimated world oilseed production in 1988-89
at 201.4 million metric tons, down 2 percent from the July forecast
and also 2 percent below the 1987-88 output.
   ``Lower production of soybeans in the United States and China
because of drought-reduced yields account for most of the
decline,'' the agency reported. ``Partially offsetting the
reductions from last month are a projected 500,000-ton increase in
Brazilian soybean production, substantial improvement for India's
peanut crop and a 403,000-ton rise in U.S. cottonseed output.''
   The report added: ``High relative prices for soybeans are
expected to stimulate area gains (plantings) in Brazil.''
   Brazil is the second-largest soybean producer and is the biggest
competitor of U.S. farmers in world markets.
   The 1988 U.S. harvest of 1.47 billion bushels translates into
about 40.1 million metric tons. There are about 36.7 bushels of
beans in a ton.
   Comparatively, Brazil's 1988-89 crop is forecast at 20 million
tons, followed by China, 12 million; and Argentina, 11 million. The
12-nation European Economic Community is expected to produce 1.55
million tons of soybeans this season, and Paraguay, 1.2 million.
Other countries are expected to produce the remainder.
   While soybeans are the largest component of the global oilseed
production forecast of 201.4 million tons, they still comprise less
than half of the total. Other sources include: cottonseed, 33.07
million tons; peanuts, 22 million; sunflowerseed, 21.23 million;
rapeseed, 21.49 million; flaxseed, 2 million; copra, 4.73 million;
and palm kernel 2.85 million.
   Because they are in the Southern Hemisphere and thus on a
different calendar cycle for growing seasons, Latin American
producers are finding the U.S. drought is affecting their plans.
   ``In an effort to capitalize on higher prices before the U.S.
harvest in 1989, Brazil and Argentina are forecast to increase
their exports of soybeans,'' the report said.
   Brazil is expected to export 3.9 million tons of soybeans in
1988-89, up from 2.7 million last season, and Argentina's shipments
are forecast at 3.2 million tons, up from 2.4 million in 1987-88.
   But the higher prices are dampening the demand for soybean
imports in some major markets, the report said. The Soviet Union,
for example, is expected to reduce bean imports in 1988-89 to 1.5
million tons, down 17 percent from this season. The Soviets are
also expected to reduce imports of soybean meal to 2.7 million
tons, down 100,000 tons from this year.
   The major U.S. foreign market for soybeans is the European
Economic Community, and the higher prices are expected to reduce
shipments to 11.2 million tons in 1988-89, down 1.9 million tons
from this year, the report said. However, U.S. sales of soybean
meal are forecast to rise slightly from 13 million tons in 1987-88.

<HEAD>Most PC's Tested Fail FCC Standards On Radio Interference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The majority of personal computers recently
tested by the Federal Communications Commission failed to meet the
agency's standards on radio interference, according to a published
report on Wednesday.
   Some 75 percent of the personal computers tested failed to meet
the standards, and the consequent interference can disrupt
television sets or cause problems with other home appliances and
equipment, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
   Companies allegedly are using a variety of tactics to evade the
FCC standards, including instances where a firm will modify a
personal computer to pass the tests but will not incorporate the
modification in other machines it manufactures.
   ``Those machines are what we call laboratory queens,'' said
Jerry Freeman, the FCC's national coordinator for
computer-marketing enforcement. ``The manufacturers don't market
exactly what they submitted to us.''
   Some of the more flagrant violations have been committed by
small offshore companies, especially from Asia, said Freeman.
However, others claim that big-name companies have also had
problems with the FCC in recent years.
   ``They've all had problems,'' said Terry Mahn, a Washington,
D.C., attorney who represents companies in proceedings before the
FCC.
   Merle Coe, president of Washington-based Haar Industries Inc.,
said his company recently tested about 150 computers before finding
one that passed FCC standards.
   Haar Industries, which makes software and accessory circuit
boards, found deficiencies in personal computers made by such large
companies as International Business Machines Corp., Hewlett-Packard
Co. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp.
   The FCC attempts to force compliance by levying $2,000 civil
fines, which Mahn labeled an insufficient threat. Mahn said that in
some cases, the agency has successfully forced companies to reform
by threatening to seize and liquidate thousands of computers in
inventory.
   Freeman said the FCC's spot check included computer models that
had originally passed the agency's Class B standard, based on
earlier tests of sample machines supplied by the manufacturers. The
Class B standard regulates emissions of machines sold for use in
the home.
   Those standards are designed to keep various kinds of products
from causing dangerous interference, like disruption of emergency
signals from police or other government agencies. Freeman said
interference could also cause other computers to lose data.
   The problem for personal computer manufacturers has been
obtaining certification. Various components in a computer generate
radio waves, and companies must make exacting tests with their own
equipment or through independent testing laboratories before
submitting a product for review by the FCC.
   The agency reviews the submitted data and makes its own
additional tests before issuing certification. In the fast-moving
PC market, many companies cannot afford to wait that long.
   ``The problem is the offshore guys, plain and simple,'' said Jim
Johnson, president of Amdador Corp., a Minnesota-based testing
laboratory.

   Stock prices rose slightly Wednesday, boosted in
part by the U.S. dollar's strength and some bargain-hunting.
   However, trading was subdued amid inflationary concerns. A
report on the British economy by the Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development recently warned of ``renewed
inflationary pressures.''
   Many players remained sidelined, awaiting Thursday's release of
British money supply figures for July.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 5.6
points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,830.9 at the close.
   The index moved up as much as 7.2 points when Wall Street posted
reasonable gains in early trading, but then prices fell back in New
York and London.
   Volume was thin, declining to 338.5 million shares from
Tuesday's 346.6 million shares.

   Stocks weakened today in light trading, but
brokers said the market signaled no clear direction and most
heavyweight investors weren't buying or selling.
   ``Everybody is complaining about lack of business,'' said Hank
Striefler, senior vice president on the trading floor at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York ``I think there's a lot of money on
the side, more than ever before.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which partly
recovered Tuesday from a three-month low, was down 8.35 points to
2,013.16 by 2 p.m. EDT.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues fell 0.36 to 147.13. The
American Stock Exchange's market-value index fell 1.14 to 293.43.
   Declining NYSE issues outnumbered advances by a ratio of more
than 7-to-5, with 784 down, 548 up and 526 unchanged. Volume on the
Big Board totaled 133.43 million shares with two hours of trading
left.
   Nearly a third of the volume was accounted for by
dividend-capture trading in Philadelphia Electric, unchanged at
18\. The stock carries a 12 percent dividend yield, but must be
purchased by Thursday to qualify for it.
   Among other active NYSE issues, Prime Computer fell 1| to 12\.
The company said Tuesday it expected third-quarter earnings would
fall 20 percent below Wall Street expectations.
   Other prominent computer stocks also weakened. IBM fell 1| to
114[ and Digital fell 2~ to 95.
   On the over-the-counter market, Farmers Group jumped 4 to 67\.
The insurance company reversed itself Tuesday and decided to hold
talks with suitor B.A.T. Industries PLC of Britain.

<HEAD>Fiat To Raise Stake In Ferrari Following Founder's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fiat SpA said Wednesday it plans to raise its stake
in automaker Ferrari SpA following the recent death of founder Enzo
Ferrari.
   Fiat, which acquired a 50 percent stake in Ferrari in 1969,
holds an option to buy the 40 percent owned by Enzo Ferrari, who
died in Modena Sunday at the age of 90.
   Ferrari was ``by contract obligated'' to offer Enzo Ferrari's
shares to Fiat in the event Enzo had decided to sell his share or
in case of his death, a Fiat spokeswoman said.
   The remaining 10 percent would be left in the hands of Enzo
Ferrari's son, Lardi Ferrari.
   The Fiat spokeswoman said procedural details and financial terms
would be discussed at a meeting early next month between the
Ferrari family and Fiat officials.
   Ferrari, which produces nearly 4,000 luxury and sport cars a
year, posted a profit of 14.8 billion lire, or around $10.5
million, in 1987 on sales of 360 billion lire, or $257 million.

<HEAD>New Housing Construction Down In Second Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Housing Starts Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer housing units were built during the second
quarter of 1988 than a year ago, reflecting continued softness in
the rental housing market, a research group reported Wednesday.
   For the April-June period, new housing construction slipped 9
percent to 406,882 units, compared with 446,955 units built during
the second quarter of 1987, said the F.W. Dodge Group of
McGraw-Hill Information Services Co.
   The report followed the release of Commerce Department
statistics saying housing construction climbed 2.4 percent in July,
to an annual rate of 1.49 million units. That was the second
consecutive monthly increase, following a 4.4 percent rise in June.
   ``Latest data reveal that housing activity has receded to only
three-quarters of its peak volume reached in 1986 when apartment
construction was being subsidized by tax incentives,'' said George
A. Christie, chief economist for F.W. Dodge, which reports
regularly on construction activity.
   Christie said most of the decline has been in rental housing,
where high vacancy rates have hindered new apartment construction.
   Construction of one-family homes has remained steady, Christie
said.
   Only six of the nation's 25 most active housing markets posted
gains in the quarter, the report said.
   Here are the 25 most active housing areas, the number of new
residential units and the percentage change from the second
quarters of 1987:
   _Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif., 15,615, up 57 percent.
   _Washington, D.C., 12,733, down 22 percent.
   _Los Angeles, 12,527, down 16 percent.
   _Atlanta, 12,381, up 13 percent.
   _Detroit, 8,117, up 29 percent.
   _Las Vegas, Nev., 6,973, up 91 percent.

<HEAD>Kodak Decides to Keep Business That Sells Lysol, D-Con And Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. has decided to keep the
household products group it acquired in the $5.1 billion
acquisition of Sterling Drug Co., company officials said Wednesday.
   Kodak concluded the Lehn & Fink unit of Sterling, which sells
Lysol disinfectant, D-Con rat poison and other well-known products
``is too important to lose,'' said Kay Whitmore, Kodak's president
and executive officer.
   In recent weeks, published reports and rumors on Wall Street
indicated that Kodak planned to sell the Montvale, N.J.-based unit,
which had sales of $594 million last year.
   ``I'm not surprised they're keeping it,'' said Mark Obenzinger,
an analyst with Wood, Gundy & Co. in New York. ``They couldn't get
the price they wanted. They paid top dollar for it, so they have to
get top, top dollar for it.''
   Eugene Glazer, an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New
York, agreed, noting that one reason Kodak needed to hang a higher
pricetag on the unit was to cover a hefty tax that would have been
levied on the deal.
   Tax law changes in 1986 make it more expensive for companies to
buy another firm and sell off the unwanted parts of it, Glazer said.
   Because of the new law, Kodak would have to pay ``hundreds of
millions'' of dollars in taxes if it sold Lehn & Fink, he said.
   While Lehn & Fink still does not fit into Kodak's strategic
plans, analysts said it's a successful and well-run company that
won't hurt Kodak's bottom line.
   Whitmore told Lehn & Fink employees Wednesday he envisioned Lehn
& Fink marketing products developed by Kodak's chemical division;
Kodak using its strength in convenience store outlets to get Lehn &
Fink products onto more store shelves; and Kodak helping market
Lehn & Fink's products overseas.
   Kodak bought Sterling Drug Co. for $5.1 billion earlier this
year as a ``white knight'' for Sterling, which was trying to avoid
a hostile takeover attempt by Swiss multinational pharmaceutical
giant F. Hoffman-LaRoche & Co.

<HEAD>Talks Begin on Batus' Friendly $4.9 Billion Buyout Offer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the first uneasy truce in a lengthy
takeover battle, officials of Farmers Insurance Group Inc. and
Batus Inc. met Wednesday to discuss Batus' proposal for a friendly
$4.9 billion buyout.
   But both sides professed themselves prepared to continue the war
they have waged for eight months in the stock market, the courts
and before state regulatory bodies.
   Batus Chairman Patrick Sheehy was in Los Angeles, Farmers'
headquarters, and was expected to meet with Farmers' Chairman Leo
E. Denlea, according to spokesmen for both companies. No details of
the talks were released.
   The meeting came one day after Farmers agreed to discuss a
sweetened, $72-a-share offer from the Louisville, Ky.,-based
tobacco and retailing company. In making the offer last week, Batus
set a deadline of Friday for negotiation of a definitive agreement.
   Farmers spurned Batus' offer of a negotiated purchase early this
year, and the companies have since been sparring over Batus'
hostile bid to acquire a controlling stake in the open market.
   Batus' $63-a-share tender offer to shareholders remains in
effect, and the company has indicated it would continue that
hostile takeover effort if the talks with Farmers are fruitless.
   For its part, Farmers reaffirmed Wednesday it would appeal
Tuesday's regulatory ruling giving conditional approval to the
merger in Illinois, one of nine states in which insurance
regulators must endorse the deal.
   Batus, whose holdings include retailers led by Saks Fifth Avenue
and the maker of Kool and Viceroy cigarettes, is the U.S.
subsidiary of B.A.T Industries PLC of Britain.

<TEXT>
   Grain futures closed mostly lower Wednesday while
most soybean contracts advanced in a fourth day of volatile trading
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``There's no rhyme or reason to it, necessarily,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It's just the
same choppy pattern we've seen last several days and I think we're
going to continue in this vein.''
   With the end of the growing season approaching, grain and
soybean traders are paying more attention to global demand factors
than the weather's effects on supplies, analysts said.
   In the corn market, which has recently been the leader among the
crop futures, ``there is very little near-term demand and nothing
to hold it in the short run,'' said Cathy Leow, assistant
vice-president in charge of grain futures trading for Thomson
McKinnon Securities Inc.
   Export demand for wheat and soybean products also has been
slack, possibly because of high prices linked to the summer-long
drought, Lespinasse said.
   ``High prices discourage demand, so that's been a drag on the
market,'' he said. ``Lower prices will enhance demand. Maybe that's
what the market's trying to tell us.''
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 3{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.90 a bushel; corn was 2
cents lower to 3\ cents higher with September at $2.85 a bushel;
oats were 4 cents to 7{ cents lower with September at $2.70{ a
bushel; soybeans were 7 cents lower to 16 cents higher with August
at $8.77 a bushel.

   Although the market's failure to sustain its Tuesday advance

dismay.
   ``I just don't know what to tell you,'' said Peter Karos,

<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Merrill Lynch & Co. stockbroker
pleaded guilty Wednesday to engaging in a scheme in which he
illicitly obtained advance copies of Business Week, then reaped
profits from trading stocks mentioned in the magazine.
   William Dillon, 33, who was dismissed last month from Merrill
Lynch's New London, is the first person to be criminally charged in
the widening insider-trading scandal involving leaked copies of
Business Week.
   In a 25-minute hearing before U.S. District Judge Ellen Burns,
Dillon pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud. As part of a plea
agreement, he is cooperating fully with investigators.
   The government said Dillon paid $10 to $30 for advance copies of
the business magazine to various emoloyees of R.R. Donnelley & Sons
Co., which prints the weekly publication at two plants, including
one in nearby Old Saybrook.
   Dillon, of Old Lyme, acknowledged that he bought non-public
copies of the magazine on Thursday mornings between late 1986 and
July 1988. The publication is released to the public after the
markets close on Thursdays.
   According to prosecutors, he bought stock in about 129 companies
mentioned favorably in the ``Inside Wall Street'' column, then sold
the securities after the magazine was made public and prices rose.
   Dillon did not make any statements during his brief court
appearance and would not discuss the case outside the courtroom.
   He was freed on a $5,000 bond and was scheduled to be sentenced
Oct. 12.
   The government contends that Dillon made about $94,000 through
the illegal activity.
   Some of the profits were made through a trading account in the
name of a yet unidentified person who engaged in the activity with
Dillon, prosecutors said.
   Dillon's mother, Elizabeth Baird, maintained an account through
which some trades were made based on the information from Business
Week, the government said.
   Neither Baird nor Dillon's wife, Diana Dillon, who worked
briefly at Donnelley, will face any charges as a result of his plea
bargain.
   Both Dillon and his mother will be required to turn over all
profits realized through the scheme to the government, prosecutors
said.
   The U.S. attorney's office last week announced that Dillon would
plead guilty and cooperate with investigators in the probe that has
extended to a number of brokerage houses.
   R.R. Donnelley has fired five employees from its Old Saybrook
plant and one from its Torrance, Calif., facility. Another
Donnelley employee resigned.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Jongbloed said Dillon usually held
his shares less than one week before cashing them in for profit.
Dillon also admitted tipping off others to information he illicitly
obtained, the government said.
   In the complaint to which Dillon pleaded guilty Wedneday, he was
charged with using wire communications on Sept. 24, 1987, to
purchase 8,000 shares of the common stock of Valhi Inc.
   Jongbloed said Dillon sold the shares four days later for a
profit of more than $10,000.
   Dillon also has agreed to plead guilty Sept. 6 to another wire
fraud count, stemming from the same scheme, in U.S. District Court
in New York.
   Prosecutors said they would recommend that Dillon serve
sentences for the Connecticut and New York charges concurrently.
The wire fraud charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Dillon's attorney, Henry Putzel, said Wednesday ``there may be
some small facts we quibble with,'' but he said his client
acknowledged that the government's evidence was strong enough to
lead to a conviction if he were tried.

<HEAD>Institutions Pushing for Stronger Role in Texaco</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two big institutional shareholders in Texaco
Inc. want a voice in nominating directors to Texaco's board, and
some analysts said Wednesday the move could run into stiff
resistance from Texaco management.
   Officials of the California Public Employee Retirement System
and the New York State Employees Retirement Fund will ask for a
formal, long-term role in choosing Texaco directors. They plan to
make the request at a meeting on Aug. 24 with Texaco President
James W. Kinnear, said Richard Koppes, general counsel of the
California fund.
   The New York pension holds 3 million Texaco shares and the
California fund has 783,000 of the company's 244.3 million shares
outstanding. The California system is the largest public employee
pension fund in the country with more than $46 billion in assets,
while the New York fund controls $39 billion.
   Two seats on the Texaco board are expected to open within the
next year. The two pension funds want institutional shareholders in
Texaco to be permanently represented on the board's nominating
committee by ``independent'' delegates who are neither executives
nor shareholders.
   The two funds are not seeking to place direct representatives on
the board's nominating committee, Koppes said, since they would get
access to confidential information about Texaco that could conflict
with their fiduciary responsibilities as money managers.
   The pension officials could be tempted to buy or sell Texaco
stock on the basis of that information _ and probably would have to
give up the right to trade the stock before joining the board.
   ``This could very well be an important development for all of
corporate America,'' said Rosario Ilacqua, vice president of equity
research at the investment firm Nikko Securities Co. International
Inc.
   Texaco declined comment on the issue. Anita Larsen, a
spokeswoman at the company's headquarters in White Plains, N.Y.,
would only reiterate Kinnear's recent public promise to meet with
representatives of the institutional investors.
   Texaco emerged from bankruptcy court reorganization in April
after filing the largest Chapter 11 petition in U.S. corporate
history.
   In its successful proxy battle in June with Texaco's largest
shareholder, financier Carl C. Icahn, management won the support of
the California and New York pension funds by promising to consider
their request for a voice in nominating directors.
   The shareholders' proposal ``probably makes some sense ... but
it does present a lot of problems,'' said Bruce Lazier, an analyst
at the investment firm Prescott, Ball & Turben Inc.
   The pension funds _ and Texaco management _ might be more likely
to accept a special advisory role for the big shareholders that was
below the level of board representation.
   But even that may be difficult, some observers said.
   ``Texaco's record has not been very good'' regarding its
treatment of shareholders, Ilacqua said, although he conceded
management had turned something of a new leaf since the bankruptcy
and had been forced to become more responsive under pressure from
Icahn.
   If the pension funds succeed, it would mark a major,
ground-breaking victory for institutional shareholders seeking a
bigger say in how corporations are run.
   Institutional shareholders have scored similar _ but less
ambitious _ successes this year at Aluminum Company of America,
General Mills Inc., Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co., Sara Lee
Corp. and Loral Corp.
   Koppes, the California fund's general counsel, acknowledged that
there was pessimism about the two big shareholders' prospects for
success in their initiative. He said he remained optimistic,
however.
   ``We're confident. Mr. Kinnear has publicly promised to engage
in meaningful dialogue on this and we expect that will happen,''
Koppes said in a phone interview from his office in Sacramento,
Calif.

<TEXT>
   Demand for petroleum products declined in July
along with a falloff in domestic crude oil production, but imports
reached their highest level in about a year, the American Petroleum
Institute reported Wednesday.
   According to the Institute's Monthly Statistical Report,
deliveries of petroleum products, a key measure of demand, fell 2.3
percent to an average 16.7 million barrels a day when compared with
year-ago figures.
   ``Despite continued growth in both the economy and in highway
travel, July's limp gasoline deliveries ... continued the no-growth
patternof the second quarter,'' the Washington-based institute said.
   But API noted that deliveries strengthened consistently as the
month progressed, ``indicating fairly healthy deliveries by
month-end.''
   Domestic crude oil production fell 1.2 percent from the year-ago
period to an average 8.2 million barrels a day.
   Despite the drop in crude production, the institute noted that
the production of natural gas liquids averaged 1.6 million barrels
a day. Natural gas liquids account for about 10 percent of the
nation's petroleum supplies.
   The institute noted that the average 7.3 million barrels a day
in imported petroleum goods during July ``came close to last July's
recent-year record.'' The United States is dependent upon imports
for nearly 44 percent of its oil needs.
   In other highlights, the institute reported:
   _Total inventories were up 1.3 percent from June and were 6.3
percent higher than in the year-ago period.
   _The nation's refineries continued to operate at high levels,
reaching 86.9 percent of capacity in July.
   For the first seven months of the year, imports were up a hefty
11.3 percent while demand was up 1.7 percent over the 1987 period.
Crude production was down during the period.

   Global arms sales are on the decline
and the superpowers are losing an important source of political
leverage as nations that once relied on them for weapons turn
elsewhere, a research group said Wednesday.
   International arms trading reached $35 billion last year, the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said in its 1988
report.
   It said $24.7 billion worth of weapons were delivered to Third
World countries. India was the world's largest buyer with $5.2
billion.
   The United States, the Soviet Union, France, Britain and China
supplied 80 percent of the international market, said the report,
written by Aaron Karp, a researcher at the institute.
   The report also said Iran and Iraq have spent about $200 billion
to fight their 8-year-old war, about half their total earnings from
oil. It said the war, which resulted in an estimated 1.5 million
casualties, ``has become the most destructive conflict ever fought
between two Third World countries.''
   The institute, an independent group mostly funded by the Swedish
Parliament, monitors worldwide developments in weapons and arms
control.
   Its 600-page annual report said the $35 billion of arms
delivered last year was $2.8 billion more than in 1986 and was the
highest in six years. It attributed the increase to U.S. and Soviet
supplies of jet fighters ordered in the early 1980s.
   But it said developing countries are reducing their dependency
on the superpowers for weaponry, buying less and varying their
sources, and military hardware is not the foreign policy tool it
was in the 1960s and 1970s.
   Developing countries, it said, cannot afford U.S.-built weapons
systems, they don't want inferior Soviet-built equipment, and they
are turning to other manufacturers.
   The report said that if the wars in Afghanistan and the Persian
Gulf end, ``the trade in major weapons could drop precipitously.''
   Last year, the Iran-Iraq war dominated the arms trade and
spawned a thriving black market, according to the report.
   It said Iraq spent from $11.1 billion to $13.2 billion on its
war efforts, or nearly 30 percent of its gross national product.
   Iran spent an estimated $8.8 billion to $10.7 billion on the war
annually, or roughly 5 percent or 6 percent of its GNP, the report
said.
   ``Virtually all Western nations found themselves embroiled in
controversies over illegal arms sales,'' said the report. A ``gray
market'' of officially approved covert sales was thought to be
worth $2 billion last year, the report said.
   Illegal or covert sales to Iran in the last few years included
anti-tank missiles and Hawk anti-aircraft missiles from the United
States, explosives and speedboats from Sweden, artillery shells
from France, and Czech AK-47 assault rifles.
   Government-to-government sales dominated the arms market, with
more deals involved licensing agreements, technology transfers, and
the modernization of outdated systems.
   The arms business ``is becoming less tidy. It has diversified
into many new forms, making the trade less predictable and harder
to evaluate,'' said the report.
   The institute also reported that:
   _ At the end of last year, 36 major wars were in progress, as
defined by more than 1,000 fatalities.
   _ The Soviet Union and the United States deployed a total of
1,250 new long-range missiles last year. Britain and France moved
toward jointly producing a new missile, and China continued its
military modernization.
   _ The five countries that admit they have nuclear arms conducted
test explosions last year at an average rate of one per week. The
Soviets conducted 23 tests, the United States 14, France 8, China 1
and Britain 1.
   _ A re-examination of seismic data revealed that the United
States conducted dozens of unannounced tests from 1963 to 1986.
   _ Last year, 85 satellites were launched with military
functions, or about 75 percent of all satellites put into orbit.
The Soviet Union reported four launch failures, compared with two
for the United States, and three other Soviet satellites
malfunctioned.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Despite Central Bank Intervention; Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar surged against major foreign
currencies Wednesday as the U.S. and West German central banks
tried with partial success to limit its climb against the West
German mark.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   The dollar's strength continued to confound market players who
had expected the currency to fall after Tuesday's report that the
U.S. trade deficit had expanded more than expected in June.
   The Federal Reserve and the West German central bank knocked the
dollar below 1.9 marks by concerted dollar selling in morning New
York trading, but investors carried it back up, forcing the Fed to
intervene again in the afternoon, said Angelo Mazzeo, an assistant
vice president at European American Bank in New York.
   The dollar's jerky movements were costly to some traders, Mazzeo
said. ``It was ugly yesterday and it was ugly again today,'' he
said.
   Relatively high interest rates in the United States continued to
attract investors to dollars, said Shani Shamah, a corporate trader
at Nomura Bank International.
   Although the trade deficit widened to $12.5 billion in June,
traders were impressed that the gap for May was revised downward to
$9.8 billion from an originally reported $10.9 billion.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar rose 0.07 yen to a closing 133.15 yen. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 134.05 yen. At the end of the day in New York, the
dollar rose to 134.01 yen from 133.73 late Tuesday.
   In London, the dollar soared against the British pound. It cost
$1.6905 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7190 late Tuesday. Later
in New York, it cost $1.6913 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7038
late Tuesday.
   The dollar peaked briefly at 1.9165 West German marks in New
York before settling at 1.9098 marks, up from 1.8894 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates, included: 1.6040 Swiss francs, up from 1.5872;
1.2313 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2276; 6.4660 French francs, up
from 6.4035; and 1,412.50 Italian lire, up from 1,399.45.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.9123 West German marks, up from 1.8705; 1.6025
Swiss francs, up from 1.5705; 6.4750 French francs, up from 6.3390;
2.1550 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1065; 1,401.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,384.50; and 1.2323 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2275.
   In Hong Kong, gold dropped to $431.31 an ounce from $434.21.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $428.50 a troy ounce,
compared with Tuesday's bid of $431.25. In Zurich, gold closed at a
bid $428.50 an ounce, down from $433 Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $431 a troy ounce from $428.90 Tuesday. Republic
National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $430.40 a troy ounce
as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $428.80 an ounce late Tuesday.
   Silver bullion prices fell in London to a late bid price of
$6.62 a troy ounce, compared with Tuesday's $6.77. On New York's
Comex, silver bullion for current delivery rose to $6.647 an ounce
from $6.610.

   Armtek Corp.'s board of directors
Wednesday rejected as inadequate an unsolicited $490 million
takeover offer from Mark IV Industries Inc. and urged shareholders
not to tender their shares.
   ``The board beleives that the company's remaining independent
would be a superior alternative ...,'' Armtek said in a prepared
statement.
   Mark IV recently offered $40 a share in cash for all of Armtek's
outstanding shares and associated preferred stock purchase rights.
   Armtek, formerly known as Armstrong Rubber Co., is a supplier of
engineered drive and heat exchange systems, modules and components.
It had $1.2 billion in sales last year.
   Two month ago, Armtek sold its largest unit, Armstrong Tire Co.,
to Pirelli Group, an Italian tire maker, for $197 million, capping
a corporate restructuring.
   Mark IV, based in Amherst, N.Y., produces technical,
professional audio equipment and aerospace products. The company
had 1987 sales of $292 million.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices finished mostly lower
Wednesday in dull trading.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for September
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, edged down 2 cents a barrel to close at $15.47. Other
contract months also posted marginal losses.
   A barrel is equivalent to 42 gallons.
   Futures prices of oil products traded on the exchange also fell.
Contracts for September delivery of wholesale heating oil slipped
0.10 cent to finish at 43.93 cents a gallon. September gasoline
rose 0.51 cent to 46.62 cents a gallon, but most other gasoline
contract months declined.
   Analysts said the declines were caused mainly by technical
market factors rather than any fresh news developments.
   ``The oil market is in the complete doldrums right now,'' said
Chris McCormack, an energy futures broker for Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   He said oil prices were unaffected by a report late Tuesday that
U.S. crude stocks fell by 3.6 million barrels, gasoline inventories
rose 1.5 million barrels and distillate stocks rose 1.4 million
barrels in the past week. The weekly data were compiled by the
American Petroleum Institute, an industry group based in Washington.
   The API data ``were really kind of a non-event,'' McCormack said.
   The market was similarly unimpressed by the API's monthly report
published Wednesday showing that demand for petroleum products
declined in July but imports reached their highest level in about a
year.

<HEAD>Hewlett-Packard Earnings Rise 30 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. said Wednesday its
profit rose 30 percent in its third fiscal quarter, but its stock
continued to fall.
   Analysts expressed concern about the quality of the computer
maker's earnings, noting the company benefited significantly from a
reduction in its tax rate from earlier this year that exaggerated
its results.
   ``On first blush their earnings look very nice to investors, but
people are looking at the quality,'' said Adam Cuhney of Kidder,
Peabody, Inc. ``The higher the quality, the more they're willing to
pay for the stock.''
   Hewlett-Packard's stock, which reached new lows for the year
Monday and again Tuesday, fell again, dropping $1.12{ a share to
$44.25 a share in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Earnings rose to $192 million, or 80 cents a share, from $148
million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose about 19
percent to $2.43 billion from $2.05 billion.
   Analysts have been looking closely at whether Hewlett-Packard is
moving ahead in U.S. orders as it rolls out its new Spectrum line
of computers based on RISC _ reduced instruction-set computing _
technology.
   U.S. orders totaled $1.20 billion in this year's third quarter,
an increase of less than 1 percent. International orders, which are
more profitable because of the dollar conversion, rose 27 percent
to $1.33 billion. Overall, the $2.53 billion in orders amounted to
a 13 percent increase from the $2.24 billion in the corresponding
quarter last year.
   ``We are particularly pleased with the growth in international
orders,'' John A. Young, the president and chief executive, said in
a statement. ``Europe and the Asia Pacific region both are
generating high order levels as the major economies in these areas
continue to show solid growth.
   ``Though our U.S. order growth rate has moderated, there
continues to be strength in the domestic economy, particularly in
capital spending,'' he said. ``This offers us opportunities in the
months ahead.''
   Hewlett-Packard has been trying to reach $10 billion in annual
sales as it enters its 50th year in 1989, but it would have to have
a spectacular fourth quarter to reach that mark. In 1987,
Hewlett-Packard posted $8.1 billion in revenue.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, profits rose 35
percent to $573 million, or $2.33 a share, from $426 million, or
$1.65 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 23 percent to $7.12
billion from $5.81 billion.

   Stocks seesawed Wednesday and finished mixed in
a slow session that reflected investor apathy and more uncertainty
about where the market is headed.
   ``Basically there really isn't any excuse for a rally,'' said
Jonathan Groveman, head of equity trading at the New York
investment firm Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co. ``There's just not a heck
of a lot going on.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which partly
recovered Tuesday from a three-month low, swung in a narrow range
and closed up 4.45 points to 2,025.96. Most broader market
indicators were little changed.
   Although many Wall Street professionals weren't surprised at the
market's indecisive behavior, others hoping for further gains
expressed dismay and resignation.
   ``There's still that fear factor,'' said Peter Karos, managing
director and head of arbitrage and over-the-counter trading at the
Minneapolis investment firm Piper Jaffray & Hopwood Inc. ``The lack
of investor interest could last three years or until next month.
Nobody knows, including me.''
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange floor totaled 169.50
million shares, vs. 162.79 million Tuesday. But discounting
institutional trading in stocks with high-yielding dividends, it
was one of the slowest sessions of the summer.
   Many brokers attributed the sluggishness in stocks to the
growing attractiveness of bonds and money-market funds as
alternative investments, since they offer relatively high return
with little or no risk.
   ``The stock market is going to be anemic unless there's a big
fundamental change in the rates available in the money markets,''
Groveman said. ``There's just too much competition out there for
stocks to do better.''
   Losing issues outnumbered advances by less than a 7-to-6 margin
in composite trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 742 down, 660 up
and 533 unchanged.
   The most-active Big Board issue was Philadelphia Electric, which
carries a 12 percent dividend yield but had to be purchased by
Thursday to qualify for it. The stock closed up \ to 18{ on volume
of nearly 41 million shares.
   Computer stocks were prominent Big Board losers, notably Prime,
which fell 1} to 12[. The company said Tuesday that third-quarter
earnings would fall well below Wall Street expectations. Among
other computer issues, IBM fell 1 to 114|, Digital fell 2} to 95
and Hewlett-Packard fell 1[ to 44\.
   Blue-chip advances included Primerica, up 1[ to 28; Texaco, up 1
to 46[; and Woolworth, up 2[ to 50{.
   McGraw Hill jumped 3 to 68| on a rumor that the investment firm
Coniston Partners had acquired a 5 percent stake in the company,
subject of persistent takeover speculation.
   In the over-the-counter market, Farmers Group jumped 4\ to 67{.
Late Tuesday the insurance company reversed itself and agreed to
talk with suitor B.A.T. Industries PLC.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 191.70 million shares.
   The NYSE composite index of all listed issues rose 0.15 to
147.64.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 0.16 to 299.47, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index rose 0.21 to 260.77.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.44
to 294.13. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 376.22, up 0.56.

<HEAD>Reports Fourth Quarter Loss of $5.1 Million But Gain for Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Playboy Enterprises Inc. reported a
fourth-quarter loss Wednesday but managed a modest profit for the
fiscal year.
   For the three months ended June 30, Playboy said it lost $5.1
million, compared with a gain of $7.04 million or 75 cents a share
in the year-earlier period. Sales totaled $37.78 million vs. $43.40
million, a 12.9 percent drop.
   For the year, Playboy said it made $2.6 million or 28 cents a
share, a 77 percent drop from the year-earlier profit of $11.1
million or $1.18 a share. Sales totaled $159.84 million vs. $161.76
million, a 1 percent decline.
   In a statement, the company blamed the lower profits on
continued losses by its Video Group. It also said the year-earlier
figure was inflated by the sale of ``Games'' magazine and two
paintings from the company's art collection.
   The Video Group has been restructured in a strategy to make the
company profitable by the end of the next fiscal year. Its new
service, called ``Night Life,'' will feature R-rated films and
exclusive programming, said Christie Hefner, president and chief
operating officer of Playboy Enterprises.

<HEAD>Sugar Futures Sink To 2-Month Low On Rising Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar futures prices sank below 10 cents a pound for the first
time in two months Wednesday on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa
Exchange amid signs of rising world supplies.
   On other markets, crop futures were mixed; livestock and meat
were mostly higher; precious metals gained; energy futures were
narrowly mixed; and stock-index futures were unchanged.
   Sugar for October delivery plunged 0.63 cent to 9.86 cents a
pound, the lowest closing price for near-term delivery since June
16, when the July contract finished at 9.69 cents a pound.
   The price for October sugar has fallen nearly 37 percent in the
past month after reaching a seven-year high of 15.30 cents a pound
on July 19.
   Sugar futures had rallied on increased Asian buying after China
moved to increase the availabilty of the sweetener to its citizens,
analysts said. But Far Eastern buying stalled in mid-July, and
futures prices have slipped steadily lower as the near-term supply
picture improved.
   Analysts said Wednesday's selloff was rooted in a French
agency's estimate that the current European sugar-beet crop would
produce 13.51 million metric tons of sugar, compared with last
year's 12.8 million metric tons. The same agency had previously
estimated a 200,000-metric-ton decline in European sugar production.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported Wednesday
that mainland U.S. sugar production for the first half of 1988
totaled 2.4 million tons, a 2 percent increase from the same period
a year ago. Hawaiian sugar production for the same period rose 6
percent to 419,000 tons, the USDA said.
   Grain futures closed mostly lower while most soybean contracts
advanced in a fourth day of see-saw trading on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   ``There's no rhyme or reason to it, necessarily,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It's just the
same choppy pattern we've seen last several days and I think we're
going to continue in this vein.''
   With the end of the growing season approaching, grain and
soybean traders are paying more attention to global demand factors
and less attention to the weather's impact on supplies, analysts
said.
   Export demand for corn, wheat and soybean products has been
slack, possibly because of high prices linked to the summer-long
drought, Lespinasse said.
   Wheat settled 3{ cents lower to \ cent higher with September at
$3.90\ a bushel; corn was 2\ cents lower to 3 cents higher with
September at $2.84} a bushel; oats were 4} cents to 7 cents lower
with September at $2.70{ a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents lower to
15 cents higher with August at $8.77 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in reaction to unexpectedly strong cash cattle
and beef markets, said Charles Richardson, a livestock market
analyst with Lind-Waldock & Co. in Denver.
   Live cattle settled .50 cent to 1.30 cents higher with August at
70.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .57 cent higher
with August at 82.25 cents a pound; hogs were .22 cent lower to .63
cent higher with August at 46.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .15 cent to .83 cent higher with August at 34.70 cents a pound.
   Gold and silver futures rose slightly in a late rally fueled by
technical factors in a thin market, analysts said.
   Gold settled $2.10 higher across the board with October at
$435.10 a troy ounce; silver was 3 cents to 3.7 cents higher with
September at $6.665 a troy ounce.
   Crude-oil futures fell slightly while oil products were mixed in
very light trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to 8 cents
lower with September at $15.47 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent
to .30 cent lower with September at 43.93 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .25 cent lower to .51 cent higher with September at
46.62 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures were virtually unchanged on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of
the Standard & Poor's 500 index settled at 261.25 points.

   Japan will increase investment in Mexico,
import more Mexican goods and ``seriously consider'' Mexican
proposals for reducing its massive foreign debt, Japanese officials
said Wednesday.
   They praised Mexico's attempt to restructure its economy and
said Japan, one of the world's mightiest creditors and exporters,
looks forward to increasing imports of Mexican goods.
   Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno singled out Mexico's
inflation-fighting plan, the Economic Solidarity Pact, for special
praise, saying it ``impressed me considerably.''
   The pact between government, business and labor to restrain
prices and wages is credited with reducing sharply the record 159.2
percent inflation Mexico suffered last year.
   Uno spoke in Japanese through a Spanish translator at a news
conference the day after meeting with President Miguel de la Madrid
and his successor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, winner from the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party of the July 6 presidential
election.
   Uno arrived Monday for a four-day visit.
   He said Japan plans to increase its imports from all Pacific
Basin countries and places a high priority on the debt crisis in
Latin America.
   The foreign minister said Japan will seriously consider various
Mexican proposals for reducing its $104-billion foreign debt, the
largest in the developing world after Brazil's. Japan and Japanese
banks hold about 17 percent of Mexico's debt.
   When asked if Japan would forgive Mexico of interest on any of
its debt, Uno said it would be difficult to make an exception for
Mexico. But he also said Japan hadn't ruled out the idea.
   Later, Seiichi Kondo, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman
traveling with Uno, told The Associated Press that Japan will
likely increase investment in assembly plants along the
U.S.-Mexican border. He said more than 40 Japanese firms already
have such plants.

<HEAD>IBM To Bring Back Version Of Old Personal Computer, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. may be
planning to bring back a version of its old personal computer in a
move reminiscent of Coca-Cola Co.'s introduction of Coke Classic.
   The new computer would be based on the PC AT, which IBM
abandoned as it shifted production over to its new Personal
System-2 line of computers, according to the trade journal PC Week.
   As with Coca-Cola, IBM would be bringing back the older product
because of customer demand. IBM would continue to sell its new
Personal System-2 line, just as Coca-Cola sells New Coke.
   IBM has refused to comment on the report, and some analysts are
skeptical IBM would go back to an older model of PC. Stewart Alsop,
editor of P.C. Letter, said: ``It would kind of give the lie to
everything they've been saying.''
   Companies such as Compaq Computer Corp. and Tandy Corp. that
continued to make computers based on the old IBM standard have
enjoyed booming sales.
   Meanwhile, IBM's share of the personal computer market has
slipped since the April 1987 announcement of the Personal System-2
line. Its old PC AT computer continued to be popular even as the
company was phasing it out.
   PC Week said the new machine would be called the Model 35. It
would reportedly use the old design but have some of the features
of the new machine, such as better graphics. The price would be
between $2,000 and $3,000.

<HEAD>Founder's Heirs Battle Scherer Management</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TROY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R.P. Scherer Corp.'s largest shareholder,
waging a proxy battle Wednesday that could lead to the sale of the
company her late father founded and estranged husband runs, said
there's no reason to believe the capsule maker's brisk earnings
pace will continue.
   Karla Scherer Fink, addressing shareholders at the company's
annual meeting here in an effort to win three seats on Scherer's
board, said the company's strong financial position makes this an
opportune time to sell.
   But after an hour of civilized wrangling, Chairman Wilbur Mack
adjourned the meeting until 10 a.m. EDT next Wednesday, when he
said results of the balloting would be announced. Ballots were
turned over to the accounting firm of Arthur Young & Co. for
tabulation.
   Meanwhile, Mrs. Fink and her brother, John S. Scherer, were
given an eleventh-hour boost when a state Court of Appeals judge
ordered that a block of 9.3 percent of Scherer's stock, held in
trust for them, not be voted. The trustee of the block,
Manufacturers National Bank, indicated it would back management.
   In nationwide over-the-counter trading, Scherer closed up $1.37{
to $26.25.
   Speaking to about 200 people attending the meeting, Mrs. Fink,
daughter of the company's late founder Robert P. Scherer, said,
``There are interested potential buyers watching closely what goes
on here ... But they will not come forward in the kind of hostile
environment the management has created.''
   Mrs. Fink filed for divorce from Peter Fink, Scherer's president
and chief executive, several months ago after the board rejected
her proposal to sell the company.
   In his address to shareholders, Fink countered that ``to divert
and to distract management and employees with a continuation of the
controversy that has marked these past several months would be a
grave disservice to the company and the shareholders.''
   While management does not intend to ``put a for-sale sign on the
door,'' he said, ``if a bonafide offer were to emerge, it would
clearly be our board's duty to give it thorough and full
consideration.''
   After the meeting Mrs. Fink refused to predict the outcome of
the vote. ``We're hoping,'' she said.
   In a statement released later, John Scherer said the pair was
``confident our candidates had won the two board seats ... We were
not certain about the third seat. But as the meeting progressed and
we learned the bank could not vote the trust, our optimism
increased.''
   Fink said the company ``wants to first determine what the
outcome of this election is.'' Fink added that ``we simply cannot
afford to be sidetracked by a headline-making personality
conflict.''
   Scherer, employing about 2,800 people at 22 facilities in 13
countries, is the world's largest maker of gelatin capsules for the
pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement industries. The company
had $290.7 million in sales and $15.1 million in net income in its
last fiscal year, ended March 31.
   Mrs. Fink and her brother control about 38.2 percent of the
company but are seeking control over an additional 470,000 shares _
or 9.3 percent _ that are held in two family trusts set up by their
father.
   The support of another shareholder, Cilluffo Associates, brings
the total shares backing the pair to 39.9 percent.
   The two had sought removal of Manufacturers National Bank as
administrator of the trusts, claiming it had conflicting interests.
A probate court judge named an independent fiduciary to decide how
the stock should be voted. A circuit court judge overturned that
ruling, and the two asked the state court of appeals to reverse the
circuit judge's ruling.
   The dispute has been marked by letters and calls to
shareholders, advertisements and news releases.

<HEAD>Other HMOs Step In To Take Over Maxicare Clients In Utah</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially sound health maintenance
organizations will step in to provide medical coverage to 20,000
people served by Maxicare Utah Inc., which is shutting down its
operations here.
   State Insurance Commissioner Harold C. Yancey said Wednesday
that all of the existing HMOs in Utah plan to contact and try to
enroll Maxicare accounts. He said Maxicare clients should
experience no lapse in coverage.
   On Tuesday, Maxicare's board of directors, citing losses of $5
million in the past five years, announced the closure of the health
plan's operations in Utah.
   Maxicare accounts that are not enrolled in other programs by
month's end will be apportioned on a pro rata basis to active HMOs,
Yancey said.
   ``They (HMOs) have agreed to take over a very serious problem,
and frankly I salute them for the action they have taken because
they have been good citizens and recognized this is the best thing
for everyone concerned,'' the commissioner said.
   Yancey said some of Maxicare's outstanding bills ultimately will
end up in the liquidation process and be apportioned.
   It is unknown if the department will dip into the state's
insurance guarantee fund, of which HMOs are members. The purpose of
the fund is to cover claims of insolvent member insurance agencies
that are no longer able to pay those claims.
   State officials say that while 11 HMOs are licensed in Utah,
only eight are active.
   Maxicare operates in Salt Lake, Utah, Davis, Weber and Summit
counties. The closure affects only Utah and not any of the other 35
states where the HMO does business.

<HEAD>Up To 11,000 Lose Jobs In American Freight, USA Western Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 11,000 people nationwide
lost their jobs this week when two subsidiaries of American
Carriers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and ceased
operations, a company spokeswoman said.
   Karen Hughes, a secretary at the trucking company's headquarters
in suburban Kansas City, said Wednesday that all workers at
American Freight System Inc. and USA Western Inc. had lost their
jobs. Also included were workers on the trucking lines American
Freight acquired last October from Smith Transfer Corp. of
Staunton, Va., Hughes said.
   Although the filings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would allow
both companies to continue operating while they reorganize,
American Carriers said operations would cease.
   Notices were sent out Tuesday, right after the company filed for
protection from its creditors in Topeka, Kan., Hughes said.
   Meanwhile, an industry analyst said the shutdown could cause
problems for customers whose orders are in transit.
   ``There are other (truckers) who will pick up the freight,''
said Ronald D. Roth of American Trucking Associations Inc. in
suburban Washington, D.C. ``But there's going to be some short-term
disruption for shippers that have freight in the system.''
   The bankruptcy filing didn't cover American Carriers itself or
other subsidiaries, including Midwest Coast Transport Inc. Those
operations did not close Tuesday.
   American Freight and USA Western are ``less-than-truckload''
haulers, which means they collect small loads from many customers
and haul them to central terminals, where they are redistributed.
The industry been hit with rate wars in the last few years.
   American Carriers, which had the country's ninth-largest
less-than-truckload operation last year, lost $36 million in the
first half of this year.
   Spokesmen for two of the country's largest less-than-truckload
carriers, Roadway Express Inc. and Consolidated Freightways, said
they hope to pick up customers from American Carriers.

<HEAD>Peru Miners Approve Pact To Settle Month-Long Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT SEAVEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking miners ratified a government
agreement Wednesday to end a crippling month-long walkout and
return to work, a labor official said.
   More than 150 delegates from miners unions across Peru approved
a back-to-work agreement hammered out late Tuesday between top
government and strike officials, said Saul Cantoral, secretary
general of the leftist-led Federation of Mine, Metal and Steel
Workers.
   Cantoral, whose group claims to represent 75 percent of the
nation's 90,000 miners, said the workers would begin returning to
work Thursday.
   Strike official Eliseo Macha told The Associated Press the
settlement was contingent on the government publishing a decree
agreeing to miners' collective bargaining demands.
   The strike, organized by the Federation of Mine, Metal and Steel
Workers, began July 18. Since then, it has cost Peru more than $100
million in lost production, according to President Alan Garcia.
   Prime Minister Armando Villanueva and Cantoral, with more than a
dozen other top government and union officials, signed the
agreement late Tuesday night, according to the official gazette El
Peruano.
   The pact calls for the nation's miners to return to work and
gives tentative approval to a major strike demand that all labor
contracts be negotiated jointly, El Peruano said.
   The government and the National Society of Mining and Petroleum,
a private mine owners trade group, earlier had rejected strikers'
main demand for joint negotiations, arguing that each company faced
unique problems.
   Analysts said mine unions were seeking to enhance their
bargaining power position by unifying contract negotiations.
   An official decree recognizing the demand for joint negotiations
was to be issued Thursday, officials said.
   Garcia on Sunday accused communists of manipulating strikers to
destabilize the nation, and threatened to declare the vital mineral
industry in a state of emergency.
   Peru is a leading world producer of silver and copper and major
source of gold, lead and zinc. The country traditionally receives
more than 50 percent of its revenue from mineral exports, which
last year totalled $1.2 billion.
   The miners federation said the strike had paralyzed 90 percent
of the mineral activity.
   Industry analysts said the strike had reduced silver output by
75 percent and copper by 70 percent. State-run Centromin, the
nation's largest mine company, halted exports of copper, lead and
zinc on July 29.
   Peru's mineral industry has been battered with labor strikes
this year due to a declining national economy. Centromin alone has
undergone 36 strikes prior to the nationwide strike, company
officials said.

<HEAD>Report: Thrift Acquisition Plan Could Be Revealed Thursday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investor group led by Chicago banker William
Gibson reportedly will acquire up to 13 troubled Texas thrift
institutions, as part of federal plan expected to result in
transactions involving 35 thrifts by the end of August.
   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram in Wednesday's editions quoted
sources as saying the Federal Home Loan Bank Board was about to
announce a transaction with the Gibson group, which also includes
Fritts Seslar Investments, a specialist in corporate pension funds
and real estate investments.
   An announcement planned for Wednesday was postponed because of
delays in hammering out final details of the transactions, and
could be made as early as Thursday, the newspaper quoted sources as
saying.
   Gibson, a senior vice president of RepublicBank Corp. from 1981
to 1986, is an executive vice president of Chicago-based
Continental Illinois Bank & Trust Co.
   ``It's a deal we can be proud of,'' said bank board member Roger
Martin. ``It's a good consolidation. It's got cash, and six of the
institutions are high cost-of-funds (thrifts).''
   Such a transaction would achieve the bank board's goals of
injecting new capital into the institutions, reducing the number of
branch offices and eliminating thrifts offering depositors
above-market rates.
   The FHLB says high cost-of-funds thrifts are insolvent savings
and loans that offer offer higher interest rates to lure enough
depositors to stay afloat.
   Martin declined to say how many institutions are involved in the
Gibson group's transaction, but a bank board aide put the number at
eight.
   Other sources told the newspaper the number could be as high as
13 and that most of the thrifts would be small- to medium-sized.
   As of April, the bank board wanted to deal with 123 insolvent
institutions resolved under its so-called Southwest Plan, which is
attempting to revive the troubled Texas savings and loan business
by closing or consolidating a number of institutions.
   On Tuesday, Martin said that by the end of August, 35 insolvent
thrifts would be dealt with.
   Martin repeatedly has said four transactions involving 20
institutions would take place by this Saturday.
   ``We'll come pretty close to meeting that target,'' Martin said
Tuesday.

<HEAD>Trade Group: Import Dealers Lost Edge, Overall Profits Declined
Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imported car dealers lost a one-time profit edge
and new car dealers overall saw profits decline as prices went up
in 1987, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association.
   Pretax profits for the average U.S. dealership fell 12.1 percent
in 1987, after declining nearly 2 percent decline in 1986, NADA
said Tuesday.
   The declines followed steadily rising dealer profits from 1981
through 1985.
   The NADA said consumers paid an average of $13,450 for a new
1987 car or truck, up 3.8 percent from an average of $12,950 in
1986.
   Profits dropped partly because fewer vehicles were sold, NADA
said. Also, a decline in the U.S. dollar forced makers of imported
cars to raise prices more than did U.S. companies, the trade group
stated.
   Figures compiled by NADA indicated import dealers accepted lower
profits rather than pass the full amount of their price increases
on to customers, in an effort to remain competitive.
   Import dealerships generally were more profitable than domestic
dealerships in the early 1980s and sometimes were able to sell cars
above list prices, increasing their profit margin, the association
said.
   That brought a scramble among dealers to add foreign brands, but
imports now apparently are no more profitable than domestic cars,
NADA said.
   Average pretax profits at dealerships in 1987 were 1.88 percent
of sales, down from 2.16 percent in 1986 and 2.2 percent in 1985,
the association said.
   The average U.S. dealer had $10.7 million in sales last year, up
from $10.6 million in 1986.
   The number of new cars sold was 10,277,900, down 10 percent from
11,459,300 in 1986.
   NADA is the major trade association for the nation's 25,000 new
car dealerships.

<TEXT>
   May Department Stores Co. announced Wednesday
it had agreed to operate its shopping center development business
in equal partnership with Prudential Insurance Co. of America and
developer Melvin Simon & Associates Inc.
   A joint venture between Prudential and Melvin Simon, called
PruSimon, will pay about $550 million cash into the May venture,
according to a news release.
   May will contribute the capital stock of May Centers Inc., the
release said. PruSimon will be the managing general partner.
   While certain conditions remain to be satisfied, May said it
anticipated that PruSimon formally would enter into the partnership
within the next 30 days.
   ``The combination of May Centers' strong organization and
excellent shopping centers with the national scope of Simon's
development capabilities and management experience and the
investment expertise of Prudential will significantly enhance May
Centers' value,'' said David C. Farrell, chairman and chief
executive of May.
   May announced July 17 it was discussing the possible sale of a
50 percent interest in the shopping center business in order to
focus more on its retail operations.
   St. Louis-based May is one of the nation's largest retailers,
with operations that included Lord & Taylor, Hecht's, Filene's,
Foley's and Famous Barr department stores and the Caldor and
Venture discount store chains. May also said that under the new
venture, it had the option to have the partnership buy May common
shares up to the approximate $550 million contribution of PruSimon.
   The company also said that any May common stock owned by the
partnership would be treated identically with other May common
stock, including the right to receive dividends, but would not be
voted nor be considered outstanding for voting purposes.
   In addition, half of any shares owned by the partnership would
not be treated as outstanding in computing May's earnings per
share. May's option to sell stock to the partnership can be
exercised by May for up to 60 months after the closing.
   The new partnership will operate May Centers Inc. under the name
May Centers Associates, May said.

   The U.S. dollar rose sharply against the Japanese
yen Thursday morning, while share prices edged higher on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.
   The dollar opened at 134.00 yen, up from 133.15 yen at
Wednesday's close, and by late morning was quoted at 133.85 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues rose 21.95 points to finish morning trading at
28,200.81.
   Exchange dealers said the dollar's sharp gain followed its
overnight rise in New York and London trading.
   ``The dollar is basically firm, but profit-taking pushes it down
when it surpasses the 134.00 (yen) mark,'' said a dealer at a U.S.
bank's Tokyo office. ``As a result, the dollar is unlikely to move
out of the range of 132.00-134.00 for a while,'' said the dealer,
who requested anonymity.
   In the stock market, securities dealers said large-capital and
export-related shares were strong, reflecting the dollar's strength
and a market rise overnight on Wall Street.
   ``The Tokyo market's bullishness continues,'' said Ichitaro
Watanabe, a broker at Nikko Securities Co. ``High-tech shares are
being bought to recover yesterday's loss, while most other shares
are also rising.''

<HEAD>Subroto Says Iraq Should Return to OPEC ``With Reasonable Quota''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto is cq as one word.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said Wednesday
he expects a slight cut in oil output when Iraq returns to the
cartel's production ceiling after a cease-fire takes effect in its
war with Iran.
   For oil prices to stabilize, it ``would be desirable for Iran
and Iraq to have a daily production of 2.3 million barrels,'' a cut
of between 6,000 and 7,000 barrels a day, Subroto said in a news
conference on arrival here.
   ``By adjusting production, in addition to remedying the
situation, the prices of the fuel will be higher,'' said Subroto.
   The cease-fire that is to take effect Saturday in the 8-year-old
Persian Gulf war has raised speculation that the fractious cartel
could make progress in its attempts to meet production limits aimed
at boosting world oil prices.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has a
production ceiling of 15.06 million barrels per day in an attempt
to support its benchmark price of $18 a barrel, but Iraqi
production has not been counted under the ceiling.
   Actual world market prices currently are $2 to $3 a barrel lower
than the benchmark.
   Subroto, who plans to visit Iran and Iraq after leaving Mexico,
also said crude oil prices next winter may be as high as $15 a
barrel.
   ``In the decade of the 90s, the prediction is that oil prices
will be strengthened,'' he said.
   Since he was elected secretary-general of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries last June, Subroto has been seeking a
consensus over the means to stabilize oil prices. As part of the
effort, he has visited the United Arab Emirates, Ecuador and
Venezuela and plans to visit all OPEC members and independent
producers.
   Mexico the world's sixth-largest producer of crude, is not an
OPEC member but follows the cartel's pricing and production
policies when it believes they contribute to stability in the
market.
   Subroto said he would meet here with President Miguel de la
Madrid and Energy Secretary Fernando Hiriart.
   Mexico produces about 2.5 million barrels of crude a day and
exported 1.35 million barrels a day in July. About half the exports
go to the United States.
   Separately, in Caracas former Venezuela oil minister Humberto
Calderon Berti said Wednesday that the OPEC price monitoring
committee tentatively was scheduled to meet Sept. 20 in Jakarta,
Indonesia.
   The date and place of the committee's meeting will be confirmed
within the next few days, according to Calderon Berti, who said he
consulted with Subroto privately Tuesday in Caracas.
   Members of the price committee are Venezuela, Indonesia,
Algeria, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. The committee monitors factors,
especially crude output, which affect OPEC's to meet its benchmark
price.
   Calderon Berti also said Subroto said he supported raising
OPEC's production ceiling to between 17.5 million and 18 million
barrels per day in a new production accord to be hammered out at
the cartel's regular conference in November.
   The new ceiling would allow OPEC to incorporate Iraq's output,
currently around 2.5 million barrels a day, into a new accord
without cutting the production of other member countries.
