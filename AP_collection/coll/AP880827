<HEAD>Value Of Fame Can Be Divided in Divorce, Judge Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has decided comedian Joe
Piscopo's ``celebrity good will'' can be counted as an asset in
dividing property with his wife in a divorce settlement.
   ``It is a quantifiable asset, just as in any other profession,''
Superior Court Judge Isabel B. Stark said Wednesday. But she added
that the way celebrity status should be quantified is ``somewhat
different'' from a partnership or corporation.
   One of Piscopo's attorneys, Gary N. Skoloff, said Thursday it
was only the second time a judge in a divorce case had placed a
value on celebrity status. A judge in New York last March made a
similar ruling regarding actress Marisa Berenson, he said.
   Skoloff, who vowed to appeal the ruling, said it was unclear how
to value Piscopo's celebrity from the judge's oral opinion.
   He said he would have to wait for a written opinion, but added
that under his understanding of what the judge had said, Nancy
Piscopo would be eligible to receive roughly $50,000.
   Piscopo is a onetime star of NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' who
has appeared in several movie comedies, including ``Wise Guys,''
and also appears in a series of beer commercials. He and his wife
separated three years ago.

   Sports entrepreneur George Shinn said
Friday he is withdrawing his bid for PTL because he could not
compete with a Canadian company's $113 million offer for the
2,200-acre Christian retreat and theme park.
   ``Based upon our evaluation of the PTL property as of today and
our desired uses, we cannot compete with the offer currently on the
table,'' Shinn said in a statement.
   Shinn, majority owner of the new Charlotte Hornets of the
National Basketball Association and the Charlotte Knights
minor-league baseball team, originally offered $75 million for
PTL's assets, including $25 million in cash.
   PTL trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton said on Wednesday that the
leading bidder for PTL was Canadian real estate magnate Peter
Thomas, representing Samoth Capital Corp.
   Benton said he expected by Sept. 1 to have a firm offer from
Thomas for the Heritage USA theme park, television network and
other property near Fort Mill, S.C.
   ``We have expressed to Mr. Benton and Mr. Thomas our best wishes
for a prompt and successful completion of their proposed sale,''
Shinn said.
   PTL, with debts of up to $130 million, has been reorganizing in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court since June 1987, three months after founder
Jim Bakker resigned amid a sex-and-money scandal.
   Bakker also wants to buy PTL's assets and said two weeks ago
that he was prepared to pay at least $77 million in cash
immediately. By comparison, Thomas has offered to pay $46 million
in cash and finance the rest of the purchase price over five years.
   Asked whether he thinks Shinn's dropping out improves Bakker's
chances, Bakker attorney Ryan Hovis said, ``I don't think it makes
any difference.

<HEAD>Quayle Shrugs Off Resume Questions; Dukakis Joins Civil Rights
Rally</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Top expected</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle, still the
center of controversy on the campaign circuit, shrugged off his
latest problem _ resume inflation _ as Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis planned to address a civil rights rally of
thousands in the nation's capital.
   Meanwhile, Vice President George Bush on Friday lashed back at
Dukakis for his criticism of the Reagan administration's handling
of drug problems, and took up the defense of his embattled running
mate, whom he had not mentioned by name in two previous days of
campaigning.
   Dukakis, pondering today's commemoration of the 25th anniversary
of the march on Washington led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.,
said of the 1963 event:
   ``It was one of the great historic events in the history of this
country and it came at a time when black people and minority
citizens were facing terrible discrimination. It was an historic
event which triggered a civil rights revolution in this country.''
   The Massachusetts governor _ who spent Friday attending to state
business _ was to march in the procession today and speak at a
rally afterward. Among those planning to attend were Coretta Scott
King, the widow of the slain civil rights leader, and Jesse
Jackson, Dukakis' one-time rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   Jackson lauded the Democratic ticket of Dukakis and Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas, saying, ``We do have a choice and chance in
November. Dukakis and Bentsen represent an alternative, a chance to
change.''
   Neither Bush nor Quayle had responded to an invitation to join
the commemoration, said Ofield Dukes, a spokesman for march
organizers.
   Bush's schedule for today called for him to remain in his
adopted state of Texas, while Quayle was expected to make several
stops in California.
   Quayle, buoyed by a warm welcome from the Veterans of Foreign
Wars earlier this week, was ready to focus on issues and move on
from questions about whether he joined the National Guard in 1969,
at the height of the Vietnam War, to duck combat duty and whether
he had help from his influential family in getting into the Guard.
   But another question arose Friday, this one concerning what he
was doing the following two years _ 1970 and 1971.
   The Indiana senator acknowledged Friday that an entry on his
official biography that portrays him as Indiana's chief consumer
investigator for those two years was ``inaccurate,'' but he said
his Senate staff was responsible for the document and that the
matter was unimportant.
   ``All of these issues are side events. Many of them are
untrue,'' Quayle said in Billings, Mont., regarding reporters'
questions about his erroneous biography and other issues that have
dogged his campaign.
   The law creating the consumer unit passed April 14, 1971, and
the division did not being operations until July 1, 1971. Indiana
officials said Quayle served as chief investigator from July until
mid-September.
   Quayle also fended off questions about his academic record and
said he would not authorize their public release.
   ``I don't want you to go through and pore over all those
mediocre grades I got,'' he said.
   The senator got a boost from Bush, who told a rally in Eastern
Texas that Quayle would be ``an outstanding vice president,'' and
Bush later called him to discuss the campaign.
   Bush also told the rally that it was ``an insult'' for Dukakis
to refer to President Reagan's drug policies as ``criminal'' and
``absurd'' when thousands of federal and local law enforcement
officials ``are putting their lives on the line every single day to
stop the narcotics flow.''
   Dukakis ``is the governor who vetoed the mandatory sentencing
for drug dealers,'' Bush said. ``He opposes capital punishment for
drug king pins. And he fought tooth and nail to keep that
outrageous furlough program that lets murderers, rapists and drug
dealers out on appeal.''
   Bentsen, meanwhile, pressed for Southern votes Friday by
stressing the Democratic ticket's interest in maintaining America's
military strength.
   ``We want to build up America's military might, but once again,
it has to be bipartisan cooperation,'' he told a crowd of 1,000
Arkansas Democrats, adding that he was ``fed up'' with Republicans
trying to portray the Democrats as weak on defense.
   Bentsen arrived at the Arkansas State Democratic Convention in a
small two-engine airplane after his campaign jet was grounded in
Mississippi. He was forced to cancel a trip to Atlanta because of
airplane trouble.
   Aircraft troubles previously created havoc with the media
representatives attempting to follow Bush on the campaign trail,
and prompted the Bush campaign to change charter airlines.

<TEXT>
   A Navy captain whose ship failed to rescue a
boatload of Vietnamese refugees who claim they later had to resort
to cannibalism to survive on the high seas has been relieved of his
command and ordered to prepare for military court-martial
proceedings, Pentagon sources say.
   Capt. Alexander G. Balian was notified of the Navy's decision
Friday, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Balian has 10 days to appeal the decision regarding his command
of the USS Dubuque to Vice Adm. George W. Davis Jr., the chief of
surface ships in the Pacific Fleet. Because Balian's loss of
command ``for cause'' is considered a permanent blight on an
officer's career, any appeal will go directly to the chief of naval
personnel in Washington.
   Balian, 48, was relieved temporarily of his command of the
Dubuque on Aug. 13 pending the outcome of a Navy investigation.
That investigation ended a week ago with Balian being charged with
dereliction of duty and ordered to appear last Tuesday at an
admiral's mast, a closed-door administrative proceeding in which an
admiral serves as the lone judge.
   Balian exercised his right to refuse the admiral's mast, forcing
the Navy to decide whether it wanted to escalate the matter to the
level of a court-martial or to simply drop the charges.
   The sources said Davis served Balian on Friday with notice of
his loss of command and ordered an Article 32 investigation.
   Balian has been told to begin preparing for an Article 32
hearing, the rough equivalent of a civilian grand jury proceeding
and the first step in a military court-martial, the sources said.
   However, a spokesman for the Naval Surface Force U.S. Pacific
Fleet in San Diego disputed the sources, saying the Navy still was
investigating the incident and hadn't decided yet whether to take
further action.
   Senior Chief Petty Officer Steve Hinney said Rear Admiral
Geoffery L. Chesbrough, commander of the Naval Surface Group,
Western Pacific, has been ordered to direct an investigation of the
matter ``and make a determination as to whether or not any kind of
further action is warranted.''
   Balian has been charged with violating a general Navy regulation
``by wrongfully failing to render appropriate assistance to
Vietnamese refugees found on the South China Sea on June 9, 1988,
in danger of being lost.''
   A second count accuses him of violating standing operational
orders for the Pacific Fleet ``which require a commanding officer
to aid and rescue refugees encountered at sea in life-endangering
circumstances.''
   The Navy also alleges Balian ``was derelict in the performance
of those duties in that he negligently failed to investigate
sufficiently and render appropriate assistance ... as it was his
duty to do.''
   The Dubuque, an amphibious landing ship, encountered the
boatload of Vietnamese refugees while steaming to duty in the
Persian Gulf. The Navy has said the Dubuque gave the refugees
several hundred pounds of food and water and navigational aids but
did not take them aboard because Balian judged the refugee craft
was seaworthy.
   The boat people eventually were rescued off the coast of the
Philippines and taken to a refugee camp there, where reports of
murder and cannibalism surfaced.
   Some survivors have been quoted as saying they ate fellow
passengers to stay alive after they encountered the Dubuque. Two
victims reportedly died of starvation, but three others allegedly
were murdered through drowning and then eaten.
   The survivors charge the Dubuque refused to take them aboard
even though their boat was disabled and they were dying of exposure
and starvation.

<HEAD>Energy Department Outlines Potential Environmental Impacts on
Seven Sites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Energy says construction of
the superconducting super collider will require about 100 miles of
new roads if the massive atom smasher is built in Arizona or
Colorado.
   By contrast, the project will need only eight to 10 miles of new
roads if it is built in Illinois or Michigan. But up to 2,800 acres
of valuable wetlands could be affected by construction work at the
Michigan site.
   These were among findings presented in a draft environmental
impact report released Friday by the department as part of a
process expected to result in selection of a site for the super
collider early next year.
   Other states vying for the $4.4 billion research project are
North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
   The collider will be a 53-mile-circumference, underground ring
of magnets capable of whipping proton beams into each other with 20
times the force of the world's most powerful existing accelerator.
   Scientists hope to learn more about the nature of matter from
studying the subatomic particles created by the proton collisions.
   The project is expected to generate thousands of construction
jobs, provide permanent employment for as many as 3,000 people and
have an operating budget of $280 million.
   Supporters argue that the super collider is needed to keep the
United States competitive in the next century, while opponents say
the project would siphon much-needed money from other scientific
research.
   The environmental impact statement presented data about the
collider's anticipated impact at each of the seven site
alternatives on water resources, air quality, ecological resources,
socioeconomics and infrastructure.
   The statement did not rank the seven sites in terms of overall
advantages and disadvantages.
   The document noted that in addition to some detrimental effects
on environment, ``the SSC would also have beneficial impacts at all
of the site alternatives. Many job opportunities would be created,
both during construction and operations; local businesses would
also benefit.''
   ``The SSC is expected to have a beneficial impact on community,
socioeconomic and educational standards as experienced at Fermilab,
a national accelerator in Batavia, Ill., where there has been an
influx of highly trained scientists into the area,'' it said.
   The report pointed to environmental impacts including:
   WATER RESOURCES _ Water wells lost due to construction of the
project: Arizona, none; Colorado, 18; Illinois, 320; Michigan, 80;
North Carolina, 9; Tennessee, 350; Texas, 2.
   ECOLOGICAL RESOURCES _ Wetlands affected by construction:
Arizona, none; Colorado, 20 acres; Illinois, 850 acres; Michigan,
2,800 acres; North Carolina, 258 acres; Tennessee, less than 10
acres; Texas, less than 10 acres.
   Threatened and endangered species whose habitat could be lost:
Arizona, Tuamoc globeberry; Colorado, bald eagle; Illinois, prairie
brush clover and Indiana bat; Michigan, Indiana bat; North
Carolina, none; Tennessee, purple coneflower and Indiana bat;
Texas, black-capped vireo.
   SOCIOECONOMICS _ Total peak-year jobs during construction, both
from direct employment at the super collider and other jobs that
would be created due to the project: Arizona, 9,586; Colorado,
9,935; Illinois, 10,996; Michigan, 9,665; North Carolina, 9,717;
Tennessee, 9,531; Texas, 9,651.
   INFRASTRUCTURE _ New roads that would have to be built: Arizona,
101 miles; Colorado, 94; Illinois, 8; Michigan, 10; North Carolina,
38; Tennessee, 13; Texas, 31.
   New power lines that would be required to reach super collider
substations: Arizona, 41 miles; Colorado, 99; Illinois, 2;
Michigan, 6; North Carolina, 4; Tennessee, 32; Texas, 5.
   The draft environmental impact statement was issued for a 45-day
public review period set to begin Sept. 2 and end Oct. 17.
   Public hearings are scheduled for Sept. 26 in Stockbridge,
Mich., and Waxahachie, Texas; Sept. 29 in Fort Morgan, Colo., and
Murfreesboro, Tenn.; Oct. 3 in Butner, N.C., and Tempe, Ariz., and
Oct. 6 in Aurora, Ill.
   After consideration of comments on the draft document, DOE plans
to identify a preferred site in November, issue a final
environmental impact statement in December and announce the final
site selection in January 1989.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Decides Tuesday Whether Eastern Airlines Can Cancel
Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines will learn Tuesday whether it
can inaugurate its September schedule calling for curtailment of
service to 14 cities at a savings of some $57 million.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker on Friday extended his
order preventing Eastern Airlines from firing some 4,000 workers
whose unions alleged in a lawsuit that Eastern's parent company,
Texas Air Corp., deliberately dismantled the financially troubled
passenger carrier to rid it of organized labor.
   John Gallagher, an attorney for Eastern, attempted repeatedly
without success to get Parker to elaborate on his two-page order in
which he said the three unions suing Eastern were ``entitled to
relief.''
   Gallagher complained that the airline's business was hurting due
to news reports that Parker's order had blocked the company's plans
to end service to 14 cities.
   ``I can't help what the newspapers are reporting,'' Parker said.
``You should know better than to rely on the newspapers.
   ``If you could tell me at this point what I am going to do on
Tuesday, you are a better man than I,'' said Parker. ``I don't
know.''
   Gallagher told the judge later: ``Our client is being prejudiced
in the marketplace. Our client does not know what it can or cannot
do.''
   Parker refused to reply in detail, saying only: ``I am working
on the opinion.''
   In his Friday order, Parker essentially continued the temporary
restraining order he issued Aug. 4 prohibiting Eastern from firing
the 4,000 workers but not preventing the company from curtailing
service to 14 cities.
   Gallagher said the September schedule, set to go into effect
next Wednesday, would save Eastern $50 million in the change of
schedules and $7 million in salaries.
   ``We will appeal,'' he said of Parker's ruling.
   Capt. Jack Bavis, a representative of the Air Line Pilots
Association, called the judge's decision ``a victory for 40,000
Eastern employees. For once, justice is working for the little
people, not just the big people.''
   Jonathan Cohen, an attorney for the association, also considered
Parker's decision a victory.
   ``We know now that at least the temporary restraining order will
be extended, that means 4,000 jobs,'' he said after the court
hearing. ``But he (Parker) said he is considering other issues. The
TRO (temporary restraining order) is the minimum. We are
optimistic.''
   Asked whether Eastern can close down its service in the 14
cities, Cohen said, ``The company has to be cautious. They are
operating at a risk with what they do. He said he has everything
under consideration.''
   Earlier, Karen Ceremsak, a spokeswoman for the Miami-based
Eastern, said in a statement that the company believes the unions
``are not entitled to relief of any sort and we expect we will be
filing an appeal at the appropriate time.''
   The statement said the airline would take no action against the
employees ``pending clarifications of what our obligation will be
under terms of the ruling.''
   The pilots' association, the International Association of
Machinists and the Transport Workers Union of America filed suit
earlier this month, accusing Frank Lorenzo's Texas Air of
deliberately taking Eastern apart to get rid of organized labor at
the carrier.
   The 81-page suit filed in U.S. District Court here said Texas
Air was trying to undermine the union's legal right to represent
Eastern employees by transferring the airline's assets to other
subsidiaries of the parent.
   Eastern, which has lost about $1 billion over the past 10 years,
posted a second quarter net loss of $89.8 million, compared with
net income of $27.1 million a year earlier. Eastern's revenue in
the most recent quarter declined to $1 billion from $1.2 billion.
   The Eastern plan, announced July 22, also calls for elimination
of 140 of its 1,225 daily flights to help cut costs.
   The plan would end nearly all operations at Kansas City,
Eastern's principal hub for the western United States, and
dramatically reduce flights at its Philadelphia hub. Flights to 14
cities also would be dropped under the plan.
   The suit said the Eastern plan violated the Railway Labor Act
and federal and state security laws.
   The complaint charged that the transfer of some Eastern air
routes, planes and airport gate rights to other subsidiaries such
as Continental was part of a scheme to weaken the IAM's power to
represent Eastern employees.

<HEAD>Transportation Department Proposes Raising Fuel Economy Standard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department proposed setting
a higher fuel-economy standard for the nation's automakers but held
out the prospect the new level would remain less than the 27.5
miles per gallon voted by Congress.
   Under a proposed rule, the corporate average fuel economy
standard would be set between 26.5 mpg and 27.5 mpg for the 1989
and 1990 model years.
   Without the rule, the standard would revert to the 27.5 mpg
voted by Congress in 1975. The standard has been set at 26 mpg
since 1986 under an administrative exception allowed by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a branch of the
Transportation Department.
   Two of the Big Three automakers praised the agency's action.
   General Motors Corp. said it would have to limit production of
larger cars should the rule revert to 27.5 mpg. ``This would give
Japanese automakers, who are already planning to import more luxury
and family-size cars with V8 and high-performance V6 engines, a
powerful competitive advantage in the larger car market segments.''
   A 27.5 mpg standard would cause the automaker to reduce
production by 212,000 vehicles at a loss of 76,000 jobs in 1989,
and by 470,000 vehicles, with a loss of 158,000 jobs, in 1990, said
John Hartnett, a GM spokesman.
   A Ford Motor Co. spokesman, Bill Peacock, predicted ``artificial
rationing'' of full-sized cars under a 27.5 mpg standard.
   ``If relief is not granted ... and the standard ticks back up to
27.5, then the vehicles that the industry supplies will not match
the demand level that we're getting from the public,'' he said in
Dearborn, Mich.
   Chrysler Corp., however, said it expects to ``meet the law as it
stands now and will meet it in the coming year,'' said a spokesman,
Tony Cervone.
   ``It is really not a Chrysler issue,'' he said. The company's
cars on average are smaller than those of its larger competitors.
   The 1975 fuel economy law, adopted to reduce petroleum
consumption at a time of rapidly rising prices, requires U.S.
manufacturers to meet an average fuel-consumption level of 27.5 mpg
on all passenger cars they make.
   The law allows the NHTSA to lower the standard below 27.5 mpg if
it finds that manufacturers have made reasonable efforts to achieve
that level.
   Moreover, the law requires the agency to consider whether
achieving the 27.5 mpg level is economically and practically
feasible.
   It was under those provisions of the law that the agency lowered
the standard beginning in 1986.
   Had the agency not proposed new rulemaking on the standard, it
would have automatically reverted to 27.5 mpg in October for the
1989 model year.
   NHTSA scheduled a Sept. 14 public meeting on the proposed rule.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley, in announcing the proposed
rule, called the fuel-economy standard ``a dinosaur that should be
extinct.''
   The standard ``puts domestic manufacturers at a competitive
disadvantage compared to some foreign manufacturers, who have been
building mostly small cars,'' Burnley said. The agency last year
proposed legislation that would abolish the standard.
   The Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market advocacy
group which has sued the Transportation Department, alleging the
agency concealed the safety impact of fuel economy standards, said
that even at 26.5 mpg the standard would cause 1,500 to 2,800 more
traffic deaths involving 1989 cars than if there were no standard.
   The additional deaths would occur because the standard would
discourage the manufacturing of larger cars, and crashes of smaller
cars tend to be more deadly, the group said.

<HEAD>Olson Says He's Glad Probe Has Ended; Will Seek Legal Fee
Reimbursement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Assistant Attorney General Theodore
Olson, informed that an independent counsel will not seek perjury
charges against him, says he is glad the 2{-year probe has ended.
   ``It has been a long and difficult process,'' Olson said Friday
after independent counsel Alexia Morrison notified him that she had
ended her investigation into allegations that Olson perjured
himself in connection with a congressional probe into political
manipulation of the Superfund toxic waste-cleanup program.
   Ms. Morrison, in a statement released by her office, said she
told Olson that ``no indictment will be sought against him.''
   Specifically, Ms. Morrison looked into whether Olson should have
been prosecuted for perjury in connection with testimony he gave
March 10, 1983, before a House Judiciary subcommittee regarding the
withholding of EPA documents.
   Olson, now in private law practice, said he has accumulated
legal bills of between $1 million and $1.5 million for which he
will seek reimbursement from the government. Under the law, people
investigated by independent counsels but not charged are entitled
to collect reasonable fees.
   As required by the 1978 Ethics in Government Act under which
independent counsels are appointed, Ms. Morrison said she will file
her report with a special division of the U.S. Court of Appeals.
That panel will have the authority to release the report, she said.
   Ms. Morrison, who helped begin the investigation of Olson in
April 1986, noted that Olson and two others had challenged the
constitutionality of the independent counsels in the spring of 1987.
   That challenge, which could have affected other independent
counsels such as Lawrence Walsh, the prosecutor in the Iran-Contra
case, was unsuccessful.
   The Supreme Court ruled June 29 that independent counsels were
legal, allowing Ms. Morrison to continue her investigation.
   The case grew out of a congressional investigation into possible
political manipulation of the Superfund, created to pay for
cleanups of toxic waste sites.
   Initially, Washington lawyer James C. McKay was appointed
special counsel on April 24, 1986, by a three-judge panel of the
U.S. Court of Appeals to look into the matter. He resigned the
following month to avoid ``the appearance of a conflict of
interest'' involving his law firm. McKay said another member of his
law firm had given advice to an interested party in the case.
   Ms. Morrison, McKay's deputy, then took over the case.
   The House Judiciary Committee had sought a far broader
investigation than the one that McKay, and later Ms. Morrison, were
told by the judges to conduct.
   The panel wanted a dozen current or former Reagan administration
officials investigated for denying Congress access to hundreds of
documents in 1982 and 1983 that the committee said it needed to
investigate mismanagement by EPA.
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J.,
said at the time that then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III, in
seeking an independent counsel with only limited jurisdiction, had
``disregarded overwhelming evidence of other possible wrongdoing''
and appeared ``to have made judgments that are beyond his
authority.''
   But Meese's decision stuck.
   Former EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch Burford, who resigned at
the height of the controversy, said she urged release of many of
the documents that Congress wanted but that the Justice Department
overruled her.
   The Judiciary Committee said the Justice Department was
generally aware that the files Congress sought contained evidence
of political manipulation of Superfund.

<HEAD>Deadline Approaches On PLO Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   As the deadline approaches, the Reagan
administration is wrestling with a decision on whether to go back
to court to try to close the Palestine Liberation Organization's
office in New York.
   It's a controversial decision, whichever way it goes, and
ultimately President Reagan is likely to have the final word.
   Two months ago, a federal court ruled against Congress and the
Justice Department and said the PLO observer mission at the United
Nations could not be closed under a 1947 U.S. agreement
establishing U.N. headquarters in New York.
   The PLO information office in Washington already has been put
out of business. The New York mission is the only real footing
Yasser Arafat's group has in the United States, which shuns the PLO
as a matter of policy as a promoter of terrorism against Americans
and Israelis.
   The 60 days allowed for an appeal to a higher court regarding
the New York office runs out Monday.
   The issue confronting Reagan, who is vacationing in California,
is whether to authorize an appeal of the decision in order to try
to reverse it _ or to let the deadline pass, which would mean
letting the ruling stand.
   So far, the administration has not made a decision, said Amy
Brown, a Justice Department spokeswoman.
   Reagan apparently is under conflicting pressure. Secretary of
State George P. Shultz opposed the closing of the mission in the
first place, while former Attorney General Edwin Meese III
attempted to enforce Congress' overwhelming decision to shut it
down.
   Meese's successor, Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, is
understood to favor appealing Judge Edmund Palmieri's June 29
decision, while some of Reagan's White House advisers evidently
want to drop the controversial subject by not appealing.
   One of the questions PLO foes are asking is whether Thornburgh's
legal views are reaching the president in California.
   Brown said Thornburgh was in touch with the White House, but she
declined to say whether his opinion had reached Reagan. She also
declined to say where Thornburgh stood on the issue.
   The Justice Department had argued last spring that last year's
anti-terrorism act, which branded the PLO a terrorist organization,
empowered the government to close the observer mission.
   But Judge Palmieri said the government did not have the legal
authority because the law did not supersede the 1947 agreement that
established U.N. headquarters in New York. However, the judge
decided that under the law the government could try to halt PLO
operations apart from the mission itself.
   Palmieri dismissed the government's lawsuit with prejudice _
meaning it cannot be brought again _ although his ruling could be
appealed to a higher court.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who argued the government's case
before Palmieri, said after the ruling that he and the Justice
Department would study the ruling ``and we will make a decision as
to further proceedings as soon as possible.''
   The head of the PLO mission in New York hailed the decision as a
victory for international law.
   ``The United Nations now has no fear that the host country, or
any host country, can violate its legal obligations and get out
scot-free,'' Zehdi Labib Terzi, permanent observer of the PLO, told
The Associated Press.
   Lawyers for the PLO, including former U.S. Attorney General
Ramsey Clark, had argued that closing the mission would violate
international law because the Headquarters Agreement called for
arbitration of disputes between the United States and the United
Nations.
   They maintained that Palmieri lacked jurisdiction and should
defer to an advisory opinion from the International Court of
Justice, which said the United States was bound to submit to
arbitration.
   But Palmieri rejected those arguments.

<HEAD>Carlucci Bans Hiring of New Consultants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No new Pentagon consultants will be hired for
the rest of the Reagan administration, Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci ruled in a move related to an ongoing fraud investigation.
   ``In view of the recent attention given the employment of
consultants by the Department of Defense, effective immediately and
continuing through the remainder of the present administration, new
individual consultant appointments may not be made by DOD
organizations,'' Carlucci wrote in an order he signed earlier this
week.
   Some exceptions may be possible ``to accommodate special
problems or unique circumstances,'' Carlucci said, but added that
all such requests for exceptions would have to be sent directly to
him ``along with detailed justification.''
   Under investigation in the defense fraud probe are allegations
that defense contractors and consultants, many of them former
military men, bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details
that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars.
   The new ban does not apply to the hiring of consultants by
defense contractors, noted William Caldwell, a Pentagon spokesman,
who declined to predict the impact of the five-month ban.
   The defense probe has not focused on consultants hired by the
Pentagon, but some congressional leaders have questioned the
Pentagon's hiring practices.
   In June, Sen. David H. Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of a Senate
Governmental Affairs subcommittee, accused the Pentagon of
``keeping (a) shadow government under wraps'' by failing to
disclose how much money it was spending on private consultants.
   The Pentagon subsequently denied that accusation, releasing a
detailed financial breakdown of its spending.
   According to budget documents, the Defense Department expected
to spend $11.4 million this year hiring individual experts and
consultants to assist with various studies. The ban would apply to
them.
   The Pentagon's total consulting budget approaches $3.9 billion,
including such services as management support studies, engineering
and technical support for new weapons systems and computer work.

<TEXT>
   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen is back in his native Texas to give Vice President
George Bush some competition for attention.
   Bentsen extended a planned four-day campaign trip to come here,
where he planned this morning to meet with local law enforcement
people about the Democrats' anti-crime agenda.
   He also told reporters he didn't want Bush's Texas campaign this
week to go without a response. Both Bush and Bentsen claim Texas as
their homes.
   Bentsen was expected to give some tough talk on crime, following
up a couple of days of presenting the national security positions
of the ticket he has joined with Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis.
   Bentsen promised Arkansas Democrats on Friday that he and
Dukakis would ``build up America's military might.'' And he said he
was ``fed up'' with Republicans trying to portray the Democrats as
weak on defense.
   ``We want to build up America's military might, but once again,
it has to be bipartisan cooperation,'' he said.
   Bentsen was cheered repeatedly by the 1,000-strong partisan
crowd, a sharp contrast with a speech Thursday before the Veterans
of Foreign Wars in Chicago, where he was interrupted by boos on
several occasions.
   His message to the Arkansas Democratic Convention in Hot Springs
was that Dukakis was a Democrat they could support _ instead of
voting Republican in the presidential election as they did when
Walter Mondale ran against President Reagan in 1984.
   ``Our message to them in 1988 is: come home to the Democratic
party,'' he said.
   Bentsen's campaign swing was interrupted Friday when his
campaign jet was grounded because of a damaged door. Another plane
was found, but Bentsen missed a campaign stop in Atlanta.
   He planned to return to Washington tonight.

Past</HEAD>

<DATELINE>IRVINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Still trying to move forward in his
Republican vice presidential campaign, Sen. Dan Quayle remains
mired in questions about his past.
   The latest brushfire to face the Indiana senator is an error in
his official resume, which states that he was the chief
investigator in the consumer protection division of the Indiana
attorney general's office for two years, when he only had the job
for several months.
   Quayle said Friday he was not trying to pad his resume and that
his Senate staff had prepared it. The biography is dated June 1,
1987.
   But once again, Quayle's campaign was distracted at a critical
moment. Now on his first solo campaign trip as the nominee, Quayle
is trying to focus attention beyond such questions.
   ``All of these issues are side events. Many of them are
untrue,'' Quayle said Friday after taking reporters' questions
about his erroneous biography, mediocre academic record and various
other matters.
   Quayle has appearances today in California. Stuart Spencer, his
campaign manager, said, ``We'll be talking about more substantive
issues and not personal issues.''
   At a Billings, Mont., news conference, Quayle parried questions
about his academic record, which he acknowledges was mediocre.
There have been suggestions that Quayle, who comes from a wealthy
Indiana publishing family, pulled strings to get into law school
after a poor performance in college.
   Quayle said he would not authorize the public release of his
academic records.
   ``I don't want you to go through and pore over all those
mediocre grades I got,'' he said.
   At the news conference, Quayle issued a strong statement on gun
control, blasting Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
as a ``card-carrying member of the American Civil Liberties Union''
and noting that Republican presidential nominee George Bush is ``a
life member of the National Rifle Association.''
   Also on Friday, Quayle spoke with Bush, who called Quayle's
campaign plane from Texas.
   ``There is some momentum building. I can feel it. I can feel the
excitement in the air,'' Quayle told Bush.
   Quayle said the vice president did not speak to him about his
erroneous resume during the phone call.
   The senator told reporters that the consumer investigation job
was ``the last job I had of many different jobs in the attorney
general's office'' from 1970 to 1971.
   Media coverage of Quayle's controversies, including whether he
used family influence to get into the National Guard during the
Vietnam War, has increasingly come under fire at the candidates'
rallies and appearances.
   At a breakfast in Sioux Falls, S.D., former Gov. William Janklow
criticized media coverage of Quayle as he introduced the senator.
   ``The American people can't stand scurrilous, scummy types of
personal attacks,'' he said.
   Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, told a rally in Farmington, Utah that
the National Guard question was ``a phony issue.''
   ``I've been angry as one who served 20 years in the Utah
National Guard and flew missions to Vietnam,'' he said. ``I'd like
to take some of the press who went to Canada to Vietnam with me.''

<HEAD>Delegates At Angola Talks Fail To Reach Agreement on Cuban Troop
Withdrawal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Delegates at the latest round of
southern Africa peace talks ended the two-day session late Friday
without resolving the issue of a timetable for the withdrawal of
Cuba's 50,000 troops from Angola.
   Instead, the delegates agreed to meet again in Brazzaville in
two weeks for more talks.
   The timetable is the key both to ending fighting between
Cuban-backed Angolan forces and South Africa and to independence
for South-West Africa, Angola's southern neighbor that is also
known as Namibia.
   Sources in the South African delegation said substantial
progress was made on Cuban withdrawal. The United States, which
mediated the talks, proposed that the Cubans pull out within 18
months, a compromise the Angolan delegation took home to Luanda
overnight Thursday for consideration by its Marxist government.
   Angola's ambassador to West Germany, Herminio Escorcio, told
reporters upon emerging from the conference: ``It is a question of
flexibility on the part of South Africa and the United States.''
   South Africa has insisted the Cubans be withdrawn within a year
if it is to grant independence to Namibia. Angola has said it would
take three to four years to send the Cubans home.
   The talks among South Africa, Cuba and Angola on ending the
13-year Angolan civil war and granting independence to Namibia
began Wednesday.
   The negotiators also discussed South Africa's support for the
anti-Marxist guerrillas fighting Angola's government, said sources
close to the South African delegation who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Angola was believed to be demanding that South Africa and the
United States stop supporting the rebels in return for concessions
on the timetable.
   The rebels of UNITA _ the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola _ have not been involved in the talks and
have ignored a cease-fire signed by South Africa, Angola and Cuba.
   The government-run South African Broadcasting Corp.,
broadcasting in Johannesburg, said the talks had reached ``a
delicate stage.'' It also said the South African delegation met
with a special United Nations observer present for the Brazzaville
talks.
   The broadcast said the talks concerned the cost of implementing
the U.N. plan for independence for Namibia.
   South Africa has promised to pull its troops out of Angola by
Sept. 1 and grant independence to Namibia within a year as long as
the Cubans withdraw.
   On Thursday, the four parties did not meet, leaving U.S.
mediators to work out a compromise proposal.
   Chester Crocker, secretary of state for African affairs, said
the talks ``were well on their way,'' although it is ``too soon to
anticipate their results.'' He commented in an interview with Congo
radio broadcast Thursday.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the Iran-Iraq war apparently nearing
an end, tens of thousands of war prisoners now look ahead to
freedom _ most with joy, but some with dread.
   Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mohammad Larijani, has said a
prisoner exchange could start within three months after the
cease-fire that took effect Aug. 20.
   But Baghdad-based diplomats say repatriation could be delayed by
hard bargaining at Geneva peace talks and by the sheer immensity of
the task of registering all POWs and determining whether they want
to go home.
   ``It's going to be a very long process,'' said one European
diplomat, who like his colleagues, refused to be identified.
   The exact number of POWs is unclear.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has agreed
to organize the exchange, registered 50,182 POWs held by Iran and
19,284 held by Iraq. Red Cross officials say they believe both
sides hold many prisoners who have not been registered.
   Diplomats in Baghdad estimate that Iran holds 60,000-70,000 POWs
and Iraq 30,000-50,000.
   Iran is also believed to hold 10,000 to 20,000 Egyptians
captured while working as mercenaries in the Iraqi army or while
working as fishermen for Kuwait, which Iran accuses of supporting
Iraq.
   Some prisoners have been held since Sept. 1980, when the war
began. But thousands of Iranians were reported captured in Iraqi
offensives in the final days of fighting before the truce began.
   The Iraqis apparently sought to seize as many Iranians as
possible as bargaining chips in the Geneva talks.
   Both sides have used POWs for propaganda purposes, apparently
violating Geneva conventions that forbid exposing POWs to ``public
curiosity.''
   Each day, Iran's state-run television, monitored in Cyprus,
shows Iraqi POWs in spotless fatigues singing the praises of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and denouncing President Saddam Hussein
of Iraq.
   Iraq, in turn, has taken reporters to POW camps and displayed
Iranian prisoners knitting portraits of Saddam and praising his
wisdom and fair treatment.
   For such prisoners, the prospect of returning to their families
will be balanced against fear of their own governments, who would
likely question them closely and for some time about the conditions
of their capture and imprisonment.
   ``People assuming they'll be instantly reunited with their kids
will be disappointed,'' the European diplomat said.
   Diplomats say many POWs may choose to stay with the country that
captured them rather than return to an uncertain fate. Red Cross
rules forbid the repatriation of prisoners against their will.
   Tehran newspaper said that at least 20,000 Iraqis have opted to
stay in Iran.
   But diplomats said that getting prisoners back is a relatively
low priority for Baghdad, which is more interested in assuring a
lasting peace and ending Iranian support for Kurdish rebels
fighting Iraq's government.
   ``The priority would be on more essential issues, such as the
establishment of ... a durable peace,'' another diplomat said.
   An early return of prisoners bearing tales of mistreatment could
damage the peace talks in Geneva unless both countries,
uncharacteristically, play down such reports.
   Diplomats said the prisoner exchange may be snarled not only by
arguments about those who choose to stay, but by uncertainty over
how many each side holds and by their fate.
   Iran halted Red Cross visits to its 15 known POW camps after Red
Cross officials in 1984 witnessed a prison riot in which guards
killed several POWs.
   The Iranians allowed the visits to resume in 1986, but the Red
Cross found that more than 7,300 previously listed prisoners had
disappeared off the rolls. Tehran said they had chosen to live in
Iran.
   The Red Cross itself suspended visits earlier this year because
it alleged it was unable to visit all prisoners.

<HEAD>Actress Deborah Raffin Gets Restraining Order After Death Threats</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An actor who allegedly telephoned death
threats to actress Deborah Raffin has been ordered by a judge to
keep away from the actress and her husband, the couple's attorney
says.
   Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Lawrence Waddington issued a
temporary restraining order Thursday requiring Steven Inwood to
stay 250 yards from the couple, their attorney, Jessica Kaye, said
Friday.
   The order further prohibits Inwood _ who played the driven
Broadway director in the movie ``Stayin' Alive'' _ from physically
or verbally harassing them, Ms. Kaye said.
   The order, which was confirmed by a court clerk, is in effect
until a court hearing Sept. 9, Ms. Kaye said.
   The 35-year-old actress, who this year starred in the NBC-TV
miniseries ``Noble House,'' received the death threats Aug. 16 and
has gone into seclusion for her safety, the attorney said.
   Miss Raffin and her manager-husband of 14 years, Michael Viner,
had Pacific Bell trace the calls and determined they allegedly were
made from Inwood's phone. Inwood was managed by Viner until Inwood
ended the professional relationship last year, Ms. Kaye said.
   When a call was placed Friday to Inwood's publicist, Diane
Barnett, a receptionist said, ``We not commenting on anything.''
Ms. Barnett did not immediately return calls.
   The couple also claim that someone left a live snake in the
mailbox of their Beverly Hills home Aug. 19 and possibly poisoned
their dog, who died ``under mysterious circumstances'' June 30.
   In addition, Miss Raffin's 1974 Mercedes-Benz was stolen and
Viner's 1988 Jaguar was vandalized Monday outside a Beverly Hills
restaurant, and the office of their production company was broken
into Aug. 10, Ms. Kaye said.

   A raid by federal marshals and lawyers for
The Walt Disney Co. netted about 2,000 T-shirts featuring allegedly
counterfeit likenesses of movie character Roger Rabbit and Disney
cartoon characters, authorities say.
   The T-shirts and other materials bearing the likenesses of the
star of ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' in addition to Mickey and
Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy, were seized Thursday when
lawyers from Hammond, Chicago and New York inspected the goods
during a sidewalk sale by C&D Wholesale apparel company.
   The seizure occurred the same day the Disney Co. and Amblin
Entertainment Inc. filed suit in U.S. District Court against Roger
and Carol Carrier, owners of C&D Wholesale, for alleged copyright
violations and unfair competition.
   The suit seeks an injunction preventing further manufacture or
sale of the T-shirts. Disney and Amblin Entertainment also seek all
profits realized from the sale of the shirts, as well as damages,
lawyers' fees and other costs.
   Amblin is owned by producer Steven Spielberg, who teamed up with
Disney to produce ``Roger Rabbit.'' Also represented at the raid
was The Great Southern Co. of Macon, Ga., which is licensed by
Disney to make T-shirts bearing its designs.
   It was the second such raid in the past three weeks against
alleged unauthorized Roger Rabbit merchandise, said Chuck Champlin,
a spokesman for the filmmaker.
   An Aug. 8 raid of a Milwaukee firm yielded 2,362 shirts and 16
screens used to make them, he said.
   Characters from ``Roger Rabbit'' are licensed jointly by Disney
and Amblin to 40 companies that make more than 500 products.

<TEXT>
   George Bush is painting himself as the
conservative heir to the Texas vote as he accuses presidential
rival Michael Dukakis of hiding his true liberal colors.
   Top Bush strategists today were holding a statewide meeting for
the campaign's Texas leadership and volunteer corps to discuss the
election plan for the critical state. Bush advisers Lee Atwater,
Charles Black, Tom Loeffler and John Tower were meeting with the
group, said spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   Bush, after addressing the meeting in Houston, was scheduled to
travel to Dallas to speak to a Marine Corps veterans group, and
attend a fund-raiser for the Republican Party's ``Victory 88'' fund.
   The Republican presidential nominee is to conclude a four-day
trip to his adopted home state Sunday and head to St. Louis and
Nashville before returning to Washington on Monday night.
   Bush highlighted differences between himself and Dukakis on gun
control, energy policy and defense on a campaign trip Friday to
Longview.
   He also accused Dukakis of lax crime policies as governor of
Massachusetts, striking back a day after Dukakis said the Reagan
administration's drug-fighting policies were ``absurd'' and
``criminal.''
   Dukakis, Bush said, ``is the governor who vetoed the mandatory
sentencing for drug dealers. He opposes capital punishment for drug
king pins. And he fought tooth and nail to keep that outrageous
furlough program that lets murderers, rapists and drug dealers out
on appeal.''
   The vice president called for more support of local law
enforcement officers ``who are out there every day'' fighting the
drug war.
   He called Dukakis the ``liberal governor of Massachusetts'' who
does not want to highlight his differences with Bush's conservative
positions.
   ``We're not going to let this man be something he's not. I'm
going to pin him down,'' Bush said.
   Bush also praised his embattled running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana, on a day when Quayle acknowledged the truth of a new
allegation, that his resume exaggerated the job he had as a young
man in the Indiana attorney general's office.
   Bush, who has not mentioned Quayle by name in two previous days
of campaigning, said Friday he would be ``an outstanding vice
president.''
   He praised the congressional qualifications that the Bush
campaign had hoped to highlight before Quayle became engulfed by
controversy about his National Guard service at a time when his
peers were being drafted to fight the Vietnam War.
   The second-term senator, Bush said, is ``a wonderfully
thoughtful person who has taken a leadership role in job
retraining, the Job Training Partnership Act ... but also is a
member of the Armed Services Committee, knows as I do that only a
strong America can prevent expansion of totalitarianism around the
world.''
   Bush telephoned Quayle from his plane Friday morning, said Bush
chief of staff Craig Fuller, and told him, ``I think things are
going very well.''
   Bush told a Longview rally that he intends to put up a fight for
Texas, ``a key state, and I'm not going to let them take it away
from me.''
   On Texas' faltering economy and depressed oil industry, the New
England native said, ``Texas has been hurting bad. But today, more
Texans are at work than any time in the history of the state.
   ``Now we've got to keep this recovery going until every Texan
benefits,'' he said.
   He emphasized also that Dukakis opposes offshore drilling and
supports gun control, while Bush takes the opposite view on both
issues of interest to Texans.
   Bush, who has been attacking Dukakis on the defense and foreign
policy fronts, also reiterated his support for the strategic
defense initiative, which Dukakis opposes.
   ``I say it is essential. I will support research vigorously and
fully and when it is ready, I will deploy it.''

   The U.N. secretary-general called a recess today
in the Iran-Iraq peace talks after negotiations faltered. Sources
said problems arose when Iraq insisted on redrawing the southern
border between the warring nations.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said he hoped both
sides would be more flexible when they return to the bargaining
table Sunday. He refused to comment on reports of problems.
   ``It is too early to ask for flexibility,'' he said Friday after
six hours of separate and joint sessions with both sides. ``We are
making progress slowly, but we are trying.''
   The talks began Thursday and are the first in eight years
between Iran and Iraq. They are aimed at consolidating a fragile
cease-fire that began Aug. 20 and at reaching a comprehensive peace
settlement.
   ``In all these exchanges today, many points have been clarified,
and I hope that on Sunday, after the day of reflection (Saturday),
perhaps the flexibility will start,'' Perez de Cuellar told
reporters.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, and his Iraqi
counterpart, Tariq Aziz, met in separate sessions for two hours in
the morning and in a face-to-face plenary meeting for four hours in
the afternoon.
   Diplomatic sources said both sides set forth their often
divergent positions on numerous, intractable subjects, from the
border dispute to exchange of prisoners.
   Velayati gave the first public indication of a problem when he
told reporters after the morning session that a settlement requires
observance of the 1975 Algiers Treaty.
   The treaty made the southern boundary between Iran and Iraq the
middle of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway and granted Iran its claim to
the eastern half. The waterway is Iraq's only access to the sea at
the Persian Gulf.
   In 1980, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq repudiated the treaty.
Five days later, on Sept. 22, the Iraqi army invaded Iran.
   Iran says the treaty still is valid under international law.
   The treaty is a crucial issue in the peace talks because a U.N.
peace resolution calls for a troop withdrawal to internationally
recognized boundaries.
   Iraq says the boundaries are in dispute and seeks renegotiation
of them.
   Sources close to the Iranian delegation said the Iraqi side was
insisting the cease-fire line be drawn so as to give Iraq control
of the waterway.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iraq also
was pressing for early dredging by the United Nations of the
waterway, heavily silted after eight years of war and impassable
because of sunken ships.
   Neither Velayati nor Aziz spoke to reporters after the session
Friday night.
   While the talks were under way, Iraqi Kurds demonstrated in
front of the U.N. building to protest the reported continued use of
chemical weapons by Baghdad against the rebellious minority.
   In New York, meanwhile, the Security Council denounced the use
of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war, especially attacks
against Iran by Iraq.
   Before the talks began, Perez de Cuellar told reporters that the
bitterness and historic hostility between the two sides was such
that it would be difficult to continue the face-to-face
discussions, which began Thursday.
   ``I don't think that (continuing) face-to-face is possible so
far,'' he said. ``We have to be a little patient. It is too early
for (two sides) alone face-to-face and even face-to-face with me
would be very difficult,'' he said.
   The Friday session began with both sides meeting in separate
chambers and U.N. officials shuttling between them.
   But in the afternoon, they returned to the spacious Council
Chamber and addressed each other directly.

   A moderate earthquake shook the Pacific Ocean
near Guam early today, the Royal Observatory reported. There were
no details of damages or injuries.
   The quake measured 5.3 on the Richter scale. It hit at 9:31 a.m.
and was centered about 280 miles west-southwest of Guam, the
observatory said.
   It had no other details.
   The Richter scale measures the energy released by a quake as
recorded on a seismograph. A temblor of magnitude 5 can cause
moderate damage in a populated area.

   Comedian Bill Cosby has said no to a
county request to make up for a $10,000 budget cut by the
administration of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in a program aimed at
preventing teen-age pregnancy.
   Franklin County Commission Chairman William Benson said
frustration and anger at state officials prompted commissioners to
seek the donation from Cosby, who lives in the county in nearby
Shelburne Falls.
   ``It's one thing to say that money is tight. It's another thing
to have to approach a local celebrity, hat in hand, just to keep
alive a program that was supposed to be a priority of the
governor,'' Benson said Thursday.
   The $10,000 grant for the program was among $40,000 cut from
county allocations in the state's fiscal 1989 budget following
projected revenue shortfalls.
   In a letter to county commissioners this week, an aide to Cosby
said the comedian would not cover the state aid cut.

   Mayor Sonny Bono says he has been
flying first- class for 30 years. Now he wants the city to foot the
bill so his wife and infant son can travel the world with him as he
promotes this desert resort _ first-class.
   Bono called a news conference Thursday to explain his reasons
for the request so it doesn't blow up into what he called a
``national incident.''
   Bono, who makes $15,000 a year as mayor, said he has flown
first-class since his days as an entertainer and as part of the
husband-and-wife singing duo Sonny and Cher.
   ``I am a family man. I don't want to go away and not see my kid
for 10 days,'' Bono said of his 4-month-old son, Chesare Elan.
``That may sound corny or ridiculous, but I take him everywhere I
go. And I also want to travel with my wife.''
   Some residents have criticized the request, which comes at a
fiscally sensitive time. Palm Springs voters will decide Nov. 8
whether to continue a utility tax to avoid a deficit.
   ``I'm just throwing it out there. If the public doesn't want it
and they say, `No, you can't travel that way,' then so be it,''
Bono said.
   City spokeswoman Julie Baumer said there are no provisions for
city officials to fly first-class or for spouses to accompany
officials on trips.

   Dozens of well-wishers flocked to a downtown club
to help celebrate the 80th birthday of famed ornithologist Roger
Tory Peterson, whose ``Field Guide to the Birds'' has become a
bible for millions of bird watchers.
   Peterson, who turns 80 Sunday, recalled Friday that it was a
seventh-grade teacher in Jamestown, N.Y., who got him interested in
birds by having his class form a junior Audubon Club.
   Peterson also remembered that his original ``Field Guide to the
Birds'' was turned down by four publishers before Houghton Mifflin
Co. of Boston accepted the manuscript. First published in 1934, the
book has since become one of the company's biggest sellers.
Houghton Mifflin threw the reception.
   In the decades since, the internationally known author, artist
and lecturer has written, illustrated or edited a succession of
bird guides, flower guides and other nature books.
   Among his many honors, Peterson has received a Medal of Freedom.
   Peterson said he was ``angry and scared'' about growing old and
owes Houghton Mifflin five more books.

   Singer-songwriter John Denver has denied
reports that he would pay the Soviet Union $10 million to take a
ride on a Soviet space ship, but he still would like to go.
   ``Let me be clear: I would give my guitar to go into space,''
Denver said Friday. ``I've expressed this to NASA. Unfortunately,
it looks like a civilian in the American space program is now a
long way off. To fly with the Soviets greatly enhances what I
already considered an incredible opportunity.''
   He said the commercial arm of the Soviet space program
approached him about being the first American civilian to go up in
a Soviet spacecraft. Last April, Denver said he traveled to Moscow
to discuss the proposal with Soviet officials and learned ``that it
costs them roughly $10 million to house, train and ultimately put a
human in space for one week.''
   ``In the past, when a non-civilian foreigner has gone up in a
Soviet spacecraft, these costs have been assumed by means of a
government-to-government agreement. Since this venture is
non-governmental, alternative means of financing will have to be
explored.
   ``Regardless of what has been implied elsewhere, I have no
intention of paying the Soviets $10 million and I think it would be
highly inappropriate to do so.''

   Designer hats for horses may be the next fashion
trend on New York City streets, says Mayor Edward I. Koch.
   Koch told the Industrial Designers Society of America on Friday
that he's been looking into ways to comfort the city's carriage
horses during hot, muggy weather.
   City regulations require that the animals be taken back to their
stables when the mercury reaches 90 degrees, but animal lovers say
the horses can experience discomfort in temperatures just below
that. One horse collapsed earlier this month while being taken to
his stable on a 90-degree-plus day.
   ``We've looked into the question of having umbrellas of
different sorts to safeguard the horses and we've discarded that as
unworkable,'' Koch told the designers. ``We've come up with
something that goes back to our roots, I guess _ a straw hat for a
horse.''
   He said there is no official design contest for such a hat, but
``if anyone wants to send me a drawing ... I will select the best
hat and then (Parks Commissioner) Henry Stern will issue
regulations.''

   Contra rebels attacked a remote
village in southeastern Nicaragua, killing two peasants and
wounding three others, the Defense Ministry said.
   The ministry said in a report Friday that the attack occurred
Wednesday in the village of El Amparo, 16 miles north of the Costa
Rican border. It said one of those killed was a 7-year-old girl.
   President Daniel Ortega said Wednesday that a total of 28,067
people have been killed and 26,486 wounded since the U.S.-supported
Contra rebels launched their war against the leftist Sandinista
government 7{ years ago.
   The Sandinista government and the Contras agreed March 21 to
halt offensive military operations. A cease-fire pact signed two
days later failed to advance beyond talks on a permanent truce.
   Negotiations broke off June 9 and each side has charged the
other with violating the cease-fire.

   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board has announced
it will disburse almost $1 billion in loans to rescue nine
insolvent saving institutions.
   The largest assistance package announced by the board Friday was
$585 million from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. that
would go to MeraBank for its acquisition of the State Federal
Savings and Loan Association of Lubbock, Tex. This is the third
Texas institution acquired by Merabank as part of a commitment made
in June under the FHLBB's Southwestern plan.
   The Phoenix-based MeraBank contributed approximately $20 million
in new capital to the transaction. All deposits of the Lubbock
institution will be transferred to MeraBank's subsidiary thrift,
MeraBank Texas, FSB, which will operate State Federal's former
branches.
   In another transaction, the board approved a $299 million FSLIC
assistance package to the Metropolitan Federal Bank, FSB, of Fargo,
N.D. to finance the acquisition of six insolvent savings
institutions in Minnesota and Iowa. Metropolitan is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Metropolitan Financial Corp.
   The Minnesota institutions acquired were First Federal Savings
and Loan Association, in Brainerd; First Federal Savings and Loan
Association in Grand Rapids; First Federal Savings and Loan
Association in Hibbing; Washington Federal Savings Bank in
Stillwater, and People Savings and Loan Association, F.A.,
Owatonna. The sixth thrift is Pioneer Federal Savings and Loan
Association in Mason City, Iowa.
   FSLIC also authorized $2.39 million to Seattle-based Washington
Federal Savings and Loan Association for the acquisition of
Northwest Federal Savings and Loan Association of Boise, Iowa.
   A final authorization of $17.4 million involved the acquisition
of the insolvent Commerce Federal Savings Bank of Knoxville, Tenn.,
by the Security Trust Federal Savings and Loan Association of Oak
Ridge, Tenn.
   These transactions bring to more than 80 the number of mergers,
acquisitions or insurance settlements involving insolvent thrifts
the FSLIC has resolved nationwide this year.

   President Vinicio Cerezo said the main
leftist rebel coalition must put down its weapons before being
allowed to participate in a planned national dialogue aimed at
ending 30 years of civil war.
   Cerezo, who has been under fire from the powerful right for even
considering talks with the rebels, said in a statement Friday that
``only groups and organizations within the law'' can participate in
the dialogue.
   He urged the Guatemalan Revolutionary Union to ``understand the
human cost of a 30-year confrontation'' and to avoid a ``blood
bath.''
   Mongsignor Rodolfo Quezada Toruno, head of the national
reconciliation commission, said the rebels told him at a meeting in
Costa Rica this week that they won't lay down their arms prior to
the talks.
   The dialogue is scheduled to begin next month.
   The Revolutionary Union is a coalition of three leftist
guerrilla groups.
   Cerezo's one meeting with the rebels _ last year in Spain under
the terms of a Central American peace plan _ sparked a storm of
criticism from the right. He has since survived an attempted
military coup.
   Cerezo pointed out in his communique that the regional peace
plan gives the rebels the option of asking for political amnesty in
return for laying down their arms.
   Revolutionary Union leaders have said they won't do this until
there is a clear sign that the government is ready to address the
sharp economic and political inequalities in Guatemala.
   The rebel leaders are currently on a Central American tour that
includes meetings with the presidents of Nicaragua and Costa Rica
and high-level meetings in Honduras and El Salvador.
   The presidents of those nations, in addition to Guatemala,
signed the regional peace accord last summer. It is aimed at ending
wars in the region through negotiations and also calls for
democratization and amnesties for political prisoners.

   Education Secretary William Bennett, a
University of Michigan dean and others have been cited as people in
key positions who exhibit ``sluggish and unenlightened behavior''
by blocking educational fairness, according to a feminist group.
   The Project on Equal Educational Rights, an arm of the National
Organization for Women on Friday named them winners of its annual
``silver snail'' awards.
   Bennett who has been an annual ``silver snail'' winner since the
inception of the awards in 1985, was inducted into the``Snail Hall
of Fame'' this year.
   PEER cited, among other things, his criticism of Stanford
University's decision to integrate literature by women, minorities
and non-Westerners into its core curriculum.
   Peter Steiner, dean of the School of Literature, Science and the
Arts at U-M in Ann Arbor, received a snail award ``for his failure
to promote affirmative action at the University of Michigan and for
denigrating the academic potential of black students,'' said PEER
Director Eleanor Hinton Hoytt.
   According to PEER, Steiner told his faculty last September that
he did not want to change the university into ``another kind of
institution where minorities would naturally flock in much greater
numbers'' and in January said that ``perhaps something in the
environment leads blacks ... to be less willing to invest the time
in college.''
   A University of Michigan spokesman did not immediately return a
call requesting comment.
   But PEER gave its highest and most positive award to Rollin
Haffer, a Port Jefferson, N.Y., physical education teacher who sued
Temple University to win equal athletic opportunities for women at
the school.
   The out-of-court settlement reached last June after an
eight-year legal battle ``represents a major advance in the fight
to achieve equality for women in intercollegiate athletics,'' said
Haffer's attorney, Ellen Vargyas.
   Greg Hlibok also received an award for leading the Gallaudet
College student body in protests that eventually resulted in
selection of the school's first deaf president and a board of
directors for the school with a majority of deaf members.
   Others honored included Bret Weinstein, a University of
Pennsylvania freshman who exposed sexual and racial exploitation at
a fraternity ``mystery party''; Albert R. Killackey, an El Monte,
Calif., parent who got his school district to eliminate what he
considered discriminatory mother-daughter and father-son banquets
for youngsters; and Julie Croteau, a Manassas, Va. teen-ager who
sued her school's coaches after she failed to make the varsity
baseball team.
   Other ``snail'' awards went to CBS sports commentators Billy
Packer and Dick Stockton, Houston Astros pitcher Bob Knepper and
officials at Northwestern State University of Louisiana for what
PEER cited as oensive remarks or publications about female amateur
and professional athletes.

   The president of the World Chess
Federation has demanded a formal apology from world chess champion
Garri Kasparov for comments he made about the federation.
   The federation, FIDE, on Friday released the text of a letter
sent to the Soviet Chess Federation by FIDE President Florencio
Campomanes. Campomanes referred to Kasparov's ``public utterances
which sow discord and which insult and threaten.''
   The letter cited several remarks attributed to Kasparov in
talking to the media about FIDE, including: ``My title alone will
kill this organization,'' ``They are like godfathers in the
Mafia,'' and ``There is tremendous corruption in FIDE.''
   ``On behalf of FIDE, we officially take offense'' to these
statements, Campomanes wrote. ``On behalf of FIDE, I ask for an
apology from the world champion,'' he added. ``Failing this, I
propose to bring this to the attention of the General Assembly.''
   That meeting, comprising representatives from the 126 national
member federations of FIDE, is scheduled Nov. 26 in Salonica,
Greece, during the 1988 Chess Olympiad there.
   Campomanes' letter was dated Aug. 11.
   Kasparov and Campomanes are longtime adversaries.
   They exchanged angry words at a news conference in Moscow in
February 1985 after the FIDE president halted Kasparov's first
title match with fellow Soviet Anatoly Karpov ``without result,''
leaving Karpov the world champion.
   Kasparov won the title from Karpov later that year.
   
   Kasparov in April called on FIDE to cede responsibility for
organizing major chess events, including championship matches, to a
group of the leading players.
   The chess champion is president of the Grandmasters'
Association, which was established at his suggestion in 1986 to
challenge the dominance of FIDE.

   The arrest of former Army Sgt. Clyde Lee
Conrad on charges that he reaped enormous profits as head of an
international spy ring brought anguish to his family and stunned
residents of his hometown.
   ``I always thought I knew my son,'' Harry Conrad said. ``We were
pretty tightly wrapped. If I had had this knowledge before it would
have killed me. It's about to kill me now.''
   His sister, Karen Henschen, said family members had not spoken
with Conrad since his arrest Tuesday in Frankfurt, West Germany.
His parents and his sister live in Alliance, about four miles west
of this blue collar town where he grew up.
   His relatives said they tried to keep in contact with Conrad
while he was in the military, but he never wrote back.
   ``He always distanced himself from us,'' Ms. Henschen said. ``He
didn't see big opportunities in Sebring. Joining the military was a
way for him to travel.''
   Harry Conrad said in a television interview that he had not seen
his son in nine years, but other family members said they saw him
when he came back in 1985 for a 20-year high school class reunion.
   ``We love him, and we are quite certain he needs moral
support,'' Harry Conrad said. ``There's no way we can take back
what has happened, but his mom and dad and family love him and he
has our prayers.''
   Conrad, 41, enlisted in the Army on Aug. 9, 1965, soon after he
graduated from Sebring McKinley High School. Acquaintances said he
seldom returned to his hometown, about 55 miles southeast of
Cleveland.
   West German authorities are holding Conrad on charges of
``compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especially
grave case.'' West German officials said millions of dollars in
payments by the Soviets may have been involved.
   But few residents of the northeast Ohio city of 5,000 knew much
about Conrad.
   ``He was very quiet, very nice, and he kept mostly to himself,
he went to the service at a very early age,'' said Mrs. Robert
Blake, who has lived in the same house on McKinley Street for about
30 years. The Conrads lived about four houses away.
   John Garrett, who taught at the high school, remembered Conrad
as a student who excelled on the track and rifle teams, but never
expressed any interest in politics or caused trouble.
   ``I was very surprised. He went into the service right after
high school and he never seemed that outgoing or aggressive as a
young person to do something like that,'' said Garrett, 51.
   ``I went down to the coffee shop and saw some of the people who
knew him as a student and they were just stunned. He just wasn't
that kind to make waves,'' he said.
   Restaurateur Dennis Rohde made light of the news with patrons of
his Tin Lantern cafe.
   ``You want our spy sandwich?'' Rohde asked customers. ``It comes
with a secret decoder ring.''
   But Rohde admitted the news seemed to have taken residents aback.
   ``They live in this town for years, and they suddenly have a spy
scandal and they say, `My God, how could it be someone from
here?''' said Rohde, 50.
   Officials have said the spy ring linked to Conrad was believed
to have stolen documents concerning NATO defense plans for Europe
and U.S. Army contingency plans for a ground war with the Soviet
Union in Europe.
   Army records released in Washington said Conrad worked for the
U.S. military for 20 years, first as an infantryman and then as an
``administration specialist.''
   According to his service records, Conrad received the National
Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, five Army

<HEAD>Youth Employment Rate At Record High; Blacks Show No Improvement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department says youth employment is
showing signs of paralleling the generally positive U.S. employment
outlook, with young workers this summer experiencing the lowest
unemployment rate since 1969.
   A record 68.5 percent of the nation's youths have jobs, the
department said Friday.
   The unemployment rate among workers aged 16-24 was 10.9 percent
in July compared with 11.7 percent a year ago, the department said.
   However the good news was tempered with figures showing all of
the improvement was among whites. Blacks did not share in any of
it, the government said. Only about half of the nation's black
youths have jobs this summer, compared with three-fourths of white
youths.
   The jobless rate for white youths in July was 8.9 percent,
compared with 9.7 percent a year earlier. The rate among black
youths was almost three times higher _ 25.3 percent, the same as in
July 1987.

<HEAD>Ag Department Warns Drought-Stricken Farmers They Can't Collect
Twice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers suffering drought losses will not be
allowed to collect on the same loss twice even if they are eligible
for benefits under more than one Agriculture Department program,
officials said.
   Undersecretary Roland R. Vautour said Friday that if a farmer
has a crop loss that would qualify him for ongoing emergency
livestock feed provisions and the new disaster payment program, he
cannot double up on the benefits.
   The basic restrictions are spelled out by the Disaster
Assistance Act of 1988 which went into effect Friday. However
Vautour the regulations and operating procedures which will
implement the statutory provisions have not been completed.
   ``Producers should start assembling their sales receipts and
other data to substantiate their actual production information,''
he said.
   Department officials have said they hope to begin actual
operation of the $3.9 billion drought-aid law by Oct. 1. At that
time, they hope, farmers can begin applying at country offices of
the department's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service for benefits.

<HEAD>Navy To Begin Random Drug Testing Of Civilian Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has announced it will begin random
drug testing of selected civilian employees this fall.
   The service said on Friday that Navy Secretary William Ball
signed its final plan for the tests on Aug. 6 and it had begun
notifying 81,000 of the Navy's 337,000 civilian workers they will
be subject to urinalysis testing for drugs.
   Testing legally could begin as early as Oct. 6, said Navy
spokesman Lt. Ken Ross, but Ross said the service does not plan to
start the program until early November.
   The Navy follows the Army which is already is testing civilian
workers in sensitive positions, to become the second military
service to launch a testing program for civilian workers. The Air
Force still is working on its testing guidelines.
   All of the military services have long tested men and women on
active duty.

<HEAD>Activists Campaign to Release South Korean Political Prisoners.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. peace activists are calling for the
release of all political prisoners in South Korea and the
withdrawal of the 45,000 American troops stationed there following
the arrests of two Americans at a rally in Seoul.
   Susan Bailey of the People's Anti-War Mobilization, a New
York-based group that opposes the U.S. military presence in South
Korea, announced Friday the group was stepping up its efforts and
forming an international campaign.
   Bailey and another American, Charles Scheiner, were arrested
Aug. 20 at a rally held five days earlier by supporters of the
movement to unify North and South Korea.
   ``I was surrounded by plainclothes police on foot,'' Bailey
said. ``They began screaming at us, forcibly grabbed us, picked us
up and threw us in the back seat of unmarked cars.''
   Bailey maintains that she and Scheiner were held by the Seoul
Metropolitan Police and by immigration authorities for 55 hours
without being allowed to contact U.S. Embassy officials, and then
were deported without being charged with a crime.
   South Korean government officials told embassy representatives
that Bailey and Scheiner violated laws prohibiting tourists from
participating in political demonstrations, according to the State
Department.

   In an unprecedented exchange program, 56
Soviet students have spent the past three weeks at Middlebury
College studying English and computers in preparation for a year at
26 U.S. colleges and universities.
   The program marks the first time Soviet students will study at
U.S. universities unaccompanied by adult chaperones, said Raymond
Benson, director of the American Collegiate Consortium for
East-West Cultural and Academic Exchanges.
   Today, some students head for the Eastern schools, most of them
small liberal arts colleges.
   ``I have never been so far away from my family,'' said a
homesick Nino Betlemidze, a 22-year-old female student from Soviet
Georgia slated to attend Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn.
   U.S. students will study in the Soviet Union next year, while
another group of Soviet students will attend U.S. universities,
Benson said.
   ``It is a mark of a new normalcy in our relations,'' he said
recently.
   Soviet education officials selected their brightest students
this year, but some weren't as fluent in English as U.S. officials
expected. Without a strong command of the language, the first few
months could be difficult for the students and host schools, he
said.
   ``We thought they would be awfully damn good,'' he said. ``But
we'll work through it this year because the students are so bloody
motivated.''
   In addition to practicing English, Betlemidze and the others
have been learning to use personal computers so they can write
their first term papers.
   Another adjustment problem is the diversity of course offerings
at U.S. schools, according to Benson.
   ``They look at our catalogs and they go berserk,'' he said.
``The wealth in our catalogs is very hard for them to grapple
with.''
   ``Women's studies?'' said a laughing Betlemidze, who studies the
physics of metals at her home school, Georgia Polytechnic Institute.
   The Soviets, who are earning a year's credit for transfer to
their home schools, must take half their courses in their major and
the rest outside of it.
   Mikhail Chkhenkeli, a 20-year-old math major focusing on
topology, plans to study Spanish, photo processing, logic _ and
tennis _ when he starts at Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, Pa.
   His major at Georgia State University in the southern Soviet
republic, the study of the properties of geometric figures that
remain unchanged even under distortion, points to the specificity
of Soviet study, and the problem it poses for fitting the students
into U.S. schools.
   ``They specialize far earlier than our undergraduates,'' Benson
said, who said he changed several college assignments for students
who felt a school's course list would not adequately meet the
requirements of their major.
   Other schools in the program include Amherst College in Amherst,
Mass.; Bates College in Lewiston, Maine; Davidson College in
Davidson, N.C.; Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y.; Oberlin
College in Oberlin, Ohio; Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.; and
Washington & Lee University in Lexington, Va.
   One condition of the exchange was that at least one-third of the
Soviet students be women, Benson said. ``We told them there would
be no exchange without them,'' he said, adding that few women have
been on previous student exchanges.
   The U.S. organizers first thought Soviet reluctance to send
women was due to fear they would not return home. However, Benson
said it's more likely because of sexism.
   Benson, who recently served as a counselor on educational
exchanges to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, hopes the educational
exchange will create a generation that knows life intimately in
both superpowers.
   ``By the next century, a couple of thousand people who really
know that other country can say, `I know what they mean, I've been
there,''' Benson said.

<HEAD>Security Clearance of Alleged Spy Ring Leader Never Reviewed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd and 12th grafs to fix punctuation.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired U.S. Army sergeant who allegedly
headed an international spy ring that sold NATO secrets to the
Soviets held a top secret security clearance but never had the
periodic mandatory followup review, according to U.S. officials.
   An Army spokesman said Friday that the soldier, Clyde Lee
Conrad, held a ``top secret'' clearance from 1978 until his
retirement in 1985.
   ``Normally, a background check is done every five years,'' said
Army spokesman Lt. Col. Greg Rixon.
   But Rixon acknowledged that Conrad had never been subjected to
the usual follow-up background investigation to keep his clearance.
   ``In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Defense Department fell
behind and they weren't getting them done that quickly,'' the
spokesman said.
   According to Rixon, Conrad was investigated and authorized for a
``top secret'' clearance in March 1978 while serving his first tour
with the headquarters company of the 8th Infantry Division in West
Germany.
   ``He then carried that clearance through to retirement in
September 1985,'' the spokesman said.
   Rixon said he had no information on Conrad's specific duties
while with the 8th Infantry, but he stressed that a top secret
security clearance didn't necessarily give Conrad access to
everything marked top secret. ``Access is still based on a
`need-to-know' basis,'' said Rixon.
   Officials in West Germany said Conrad was in charge of guarding
the classified documents in a safe at a U.S. base.
   Conrad was arrested in West Germany on Tuesday and charged with
``compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especially
grave case,'' prosecutors said.
   Officials say the ring started operating in the late 1970s,
reportedly selling the Soviets secret documents about nuclear
missile bases, military pipelines and NATO troop strength.
   Attributing the information to a West German newspaper that it
did not identify, ``CBS Evening News'' reported Friday that the
41-year-old Conrad collected more than $1 million in the sales of
NATO secrets. CBS said investigators believed Conrad deposited the
money in numbered Swiss bank accounts but did not use his name.
   CBS said investigators have uncovered evidence of a
European-wide operation, run from Conrad's West German home, with
other agents operating out of three neutral countries. They
included an agent in Switzerland who handled money, two in Sweden
who acted as couriers, and a Hungarian intelligence officer in
Vienna, Austria, who was said to be Conrad's controller.
   In Molndal, Sweden, a district court arraigned two
Hungarian-born Swedish brothers as suspected members of the spy
ring.
   Prosecutors in Sweden and West Germany said the two men were
couriers for the network. Sandor Kercsik, 48, and Imre Kercsik, 34,
confessed to working for the Hungarian intelligence service, Chief
Prosecutor Sven-Olof Hakansson told reporters.
   CBS added that the different ways countries handle spy cases
became advantageous to Conrad's alleged network. In Austria
espionage is considered a crime only if it is against the Austrian
government, and Swiss law does not allow it to lift banking secrecy
laws for espionage investigations.
   ``It could take months before we know the full extent of the
damage to NATO defenses,'' said a spokesman for West German
prosecutors.
   Meanwhile, Conrad's German wife, Antje, told The Associated
Press outside the couple's home in the central German town of Bad
Kreuznach on Friday that she had not seen him since his arrest but
added, ``I expect to see him next week.''

   BOULOGNE-SUR-MER, France (AP) _ A French magistrate charged a
Brazilian woman in connection with the drowning of another woman
who was trying to swim the English Channel.
   Judith Russo, 51, was charged Friday with ``failing to assist a
person in danger.'' She was in the escort boat Tuesday supervising
the swim of Renata Agondi, 20, also of Brazil.
   Ms. Agondi drowned Tuesday night about six miles off the coast
of France during an attempt to swim from Dover across the channel.
   The magistrate concluded that Ms. Agondi was exhausted, which
led to her drowning, and charged that Ms. Russo did not try to
dissuade her from continuing the swim.
   Judicial officials said Ms. Russo was ordered jailed pending the
fixing of bail.

<HEAD>Afghan Foreign Minister Says Communist Attempt A Failure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghanistan's foreign minister said
Soviet-backed efforts to build a communist society in Afghanistan
failed, so the country wants to introduce a multiparty system and
mixed economy.
   Foreign Minister Abdul Vakil also said Friday that Pakistan,
which supports the Afghan guerrillas, has a ``subversive attitude''
that threatens the success of an accord calling for the withdrawal
of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   ``We once thought socialism could be built in Afghanistan, but
this was a theory that proved wrong,'' Vakil said at a news
conference. ``The country has had a feudal, traditional tribal
system, and socialism is a luxury in such a backward state.''
   He added, ``State ownership of property is under 20 percent,
public ownership of land under 1 percent. How could one build
socialism amid such circumstances? We have no funds for that.''
   ``A multiparty system and a mixed economy is the choice of our
people. We have failed with the land reform, with the obliteration
of illiteracy, our reforms were rash and ran across national and
tribal feelings,'' Vakil said.
   While admitting failure to establish a one-party communist
state, Vakil did not criticize the Soviet military intervention in
Afghanistan in Dec. 1979.
   Soviet troops entered to back the Afghan government in its war
with Moslem guerrillas, who are based in Pakistan.
   Under a U.N.-mediated accord reached in Geneva in April, the
Soviet troops began withdrawing May 15 and are to be out of the
country by Feb. 15.
   ``Only three months have passed since the signing of the Geneva
agreements, and there are another seven left,'' Vakil said. ``We do
hope that the United Nations and other international bodies will be
able to see that order returns in that respect. If not, we shall
take joint steps with the Soviet Union.''
   He did not elaborate.
   While Soviet troops have withdrawn already from 25 of the
country's 30 provinces, Vakil said, none of the provinces could be
taken over by ``the armed extremists'' fighting government troops.
   He pledged the Kabul government would pursue ``the policy of
national reconciliation'' and stop further bloodshed. ``But where
rockets are fired at us, we retaliate firmly,'' he said.
   Vakil said his government is striving for a dialogue with the
opposition, the aim being a broad-based coalition government.
   ``Pakistan itself agreed to this ... If it continues its
subversive attitude, the Geneva accords' spirit and content could
be eroded,'' he said.

<HEAD>Talks End Without Agreement On Cuban Withdrawal; More Talks
Scheduled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest round of talks on the
future of Angola and South-West Africa left unresolved the key
question of a timetable for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from
Angola.
   The delegates agreed Friday to return to Brazzaville the week of
Sept. 5 for more meetings after adjourning the latest negotiations,
which began Wednesday.
   Cuba and Angola have said the withdrawal process for the 50,000
Cuban troops from Angola will take four years. The South Africans
want the withdrawal to be linked to their own withdrawal from
South-West Africa, due to be completed by June 1989.
   South Africa rules South-West Africa _ also known as Namibia _
under a disputed mandate.
   A joint statement issued by the Angolan, Cuban and South African
delegations and the American mediators described the talks as
serious, detailed and constructive.
   An American diplomat close to the U.S. delegation said a Sept. 1
target date for agreement on the Cuban withdrawal timetable was not
applicable now.
   ``There is a substantial set of differences of perspective on
some issues. The parties come here with a certain view of the
situation: it isn't just a blank check,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   He refused to speculate on the content of specific proposals but
said the differences between the two sides can be resolved.
   Earlier Friday, sources in the South African delegation said
substantial progress had been made on the Cuban withdrawal issue.
They said the United States proposed the Cubans pull out within 18
months, a compromise the Angolan delegation took home to Luanda for
consideration by its government.
   Angola's ambassador to West Germany, Herminio Escorcio, told
reporters on emerging from the talks: ``It is a question of
flexibility on the part of South Africa and the United States,''
who both support the Angolan rebels.
   On the question of continuing U.S. support for anti-Marxist
UNITA guerrillas, which was raised earlier in the week by President
Eduardo dos Santos of Angola, the American diplomat said this was
obviously on delegates' minds but was not on the agenda.
   The South African-backed UNITA guerrillas led by Jonas Savimbi
are fighting to overthrow the Angolan government. UNITA has not
been involved in the Brazzaville talks and has ignored a cease-fire
signed by South Africa, Angola and Cuba.
   When asked if the United States was under pressure over its
support for UNITA, the American diplomat said, ``It can't be a
bargaining chip. It's absurd to ask us to unilaterally disengage. I
don't consider it a condition of our mediation (at the talks).
There are no conditions on our acting as mediators in that way.''

   A Navy videotape made aboard the USS Vincennes
during the battle that led to the accidental downing of an Iranian
airliner shows a tense crew that rejoices when it thinks it has
shot down a fighter plane.
   ``That was a dead-on!'' shouted a crewman, moments after the
missile roared into the sky aboard the Persian Gulf. ``Direct hit
on the airplane?'' asked someone. ``Yes,'' another replied.
   But within 10 minutes, the crew members appeared ``bewildered
and solemn'' after learning the missile had shot down a civilian
airliner instead of an Iranian F-14, NBC-TV reported. All 290
people aboard the jet died.
   The tape, made by a Navy camera team during the July 3 incident,
was obtained by NBC through the Freedom of Information Act and
shown Friday on its ``Nightly News.'' It also was broadcast on
other networks.
   A U.S. Defense Department investigation found that the Vincennes
crew had misinterpreted radar and electronic signals emitted from
the Iranian Airbus A-300.
   The investigators blamed human error by the crew, but Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said Iran bore a heavy responsibility
since it allowed the jetliner to fly over the area while a sea
battle raged below.
   Carlucci said no Navy personnel will be disciplined.
   The tape shows the Vincennes crew training their binoculars on
distant Iranian gunboats at the start of the battle. ``One appears
to be going out to starboard and one's in the middle,'' called out
someone.
   ``Coming inbound fast. The one at 3-5-0 is inbound,'' said
another. ``There she goes!'' shouted someone else.
   During the ensuing fight with the gunboats, which used the
5-inch guns mounted on deck, one crewman yelled, ``I don't know
where it's hitting.''
   ``Come on, let's keep it down,'' said another over the din of
the radio transmissions and firing of the guns.
   In the tape, a crewman stared intently at a green radar screen,
a supervisor paced back and forth, and someone called out the
positions of the approaching vessels.
   Then the missiles blast off from the ship's deck. A crewman
wearing earphones shouted, ``Oh, dead!'' Three other crewmen
gathered around him, and he shouted ``That was a dead-on!''
   ``Relax,'' shouted someone. ``Keep the noise down,'' another
person yelled. ``Knock it off,'' ordered another.
   ``Direct hit on the airplane?'' asked someone. ``Yes,'' another
replied.
   Within 10 minutes, the crew of the Aegis-class crusier, which
contains the Navy's most sophisticated electronic warfare
equipment, realized it had shot down an airliner, and began a
futile search for survivors, NBC reported.
   The Defense Department's report said several of the crew's
assumptions about the approaching flight were wrong, including that
it was descending toward the Vincennes and flying outside a
commercial air corridor.
   Iran has rejected U.S. claims it was partly responsible for the
tragedy, saying the Navy's presence in the Persian Gulf was to
blame.

   Moslem rebels burned a passenger
bus and car today and fled with 28 hostages after soldiers arrived,
the military said.
   Lt. Col. Porcawa Dia, regional military commander, said the
incident occurred at dawn on an isolated stretch of highway on the
island of Basilan, 560 miles south of Manila.
   Dia said three vehicles carrying 50 people bound for Zamboanga
were stopped by about 30 suspected members of the Moro National
Liberation Front.
   The guerrillas belong to the main faction of Moslem separatist
rebels seeking independence for the southern island of Mindanao.
   Dia said the rebels ordered the passengers to leave the three
vehicles and then started setting the vehicles on fire. Two of the
vehicles had burned when the soldiers arrived, he said.
   A gunfight broke out, during which eight of the passengers
escaped and 14 others were rescued by soldiers, Dia said. He said
the rebels escaped in the remaining vehicle with the other
passengers and were believed to be hiding in a nearby mountain
village.
   He said the area was cordoned off to prevent the rebels from
escaping.

<HEAD>National Guard Releases Records, Former Guardsmen Play Down Quayle
AWOL</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE H. DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indiana National Guard officials have
released records that indicate Dan Quayle was absent without leave
during his last drill meeting, but former unit members downplayed
seriousness of the offense.
   ``It wasn't like walking off the front lines,''said Michael
Tropp, a former member of Quayle's public information unit. ``But
obviously AWOL in the Guard meant that you weren't where you were
supposed to be.''
   The Republican vice presidential candidate has been dogged in
recent days by accusations he used his prominent family's
connections to gain a position at the Guard's headquarters
detachment at the height of the Vietnam War.
   Capt. Cathi Kiger, a spokeswoman for the National Guard, said
Quayle's record of service was solid.
   ``It appears Senator Quayle mised two drills in six years. We
can still consider his attendance very good,'' said Kiger, who
released the documents Friday. ``If you missed five drills you were
ordered into active duty.''
   ``The smart ones obviously didn't do it more than five times,''
Tropp said in a telephone interview from his Sturgis, Mich., home.
   ``His attendance record was perfectly acceptable,'' Quayle
spokesman Jeff Nesbit said Friday from his Washington, D.C.,
office. ``He did miss the last weekend, but that was fairly common.
I don't think it's an issue.''
   The morning report for the May 1975 drill _ the last in which
Quayle participated _ shows a second unit member was absent in
addition to Quayle.
   Kiger said enlisted men who had fewer than the allowed five
absences during their stint occasionally did not show up for their
final drill weekend.
   ``You did your six years and said, `Good bye,' '' Kiger said.
   Lt. Timothy R. Sendak, a member of Quayle's unit, said he did
not recall AWOL absences as being particularly commonplace in the
Guard.
   ``It just didn't happen that often,'' said Sendak, who stressed
he was unfamiliar with circumstances of Quayle's absence. ``If a
regulation was broken, it was broken.''
   But both Sendak and Jon D. Perry, another member of the unit,
said commanders took special circumstances into account.
   ``Most of the people in the unit were professionals, and from
time-to-time provisions were made,'' said Perry, of Bloomington,
Ind. ``We all had occasions when there was some kind of conflict.''
   Sendak added, ``It was quite common for Guardsmen or reservists
to take time and make it up later.''
   The records further confirmed both that the headquarters
detachment was under strength when Quayle enlisted in May 1969 and
that a slot was available at the time he transferred into the
command's public information unit.

   A jury took only 14 hours to clear 20
reputed mobsters of racketeering charges in what was believed to be
America's longest federal criminal trial, a 21-month marathon that
generated 40,000 pages of transcripts.
   The acquittal Friday of all defendants in U.S. District Court
was a stunning defeat for prosecutors, who said the men on trial
represented virtually the entire New Jersey faction of a powerful
Mafia family.
   The government had charged that Anthony ``Tumac'' Accetturo of
Hollywood, Fla., and co-defendants controlled the Lucchese
organized crime faction and its illegal gambling, loan sharking,
drug dealing and fraudulent credit card operations.
   After the verdicts were read, cheers and applause broke out in
the courtroom. Defendants and lawyers hugged and kissed, shouting
``thank you'' and ``God bless you'' to jurors, some of whom wept.
   Many on the defense team quickly moved to a nearby tavern, where
the celebration continued as a defendant went behind the bar to
serve drinks.
   ``I'm just glad it was everybody (acquitted),'' said defendant
Michael Taccetta, a Florham Park resident who was charged with
supervising the mob faction.
   The prosecutors appeared dejected.
   ``There really is very little you can say,'' said U.S. Attorney
Samuel A. Alito Jr. ``We're disappointed by the jury's verdict,
needless to say, but when you try cases you have to accept the
verdict whether it's good or bad.
   ``Despite this loss, the days of the Mafia are numbered,'' he
said.
   ``Apparently the jury just resented the length (of the trial)
and the breadth of the indictment,'' said V. Grady O'Malley, the
Justice Department attorney who prosecuted the case.
   Defense attorney David Ruhnke said the verdict represented a
``complete rejection'' of lengthy government racketeering
prosecutions involving large numbers of defendants.
   Alito, who assumed his post after the indictment was returned in
August 1985, said the experience would not deter him from
prosecuting crime groups if such a broad indictment was necessary.
   However, he said, ``If there is an alternative, a way of
achieving the same result ... then we're going to do that.''
   One juror, contacted at home, criticized of the trial's length.
   ``They should never, ever do anything like this to anybody
again. It's really unfair, not only to defendants but to jurors,''
Dorothy Bannigan of Jersey City said in a telephone interview.
   Asked about the verdict, she said, ``I can sleep. I can go to
bed with a clear conscience.''
   The panel began deliberating Thursday morning. They were faced
with testimony from 89 witnesses, 850 exhibits, including 400
tapes, and a court file 5{ feet thick that included 40,000 pages of
transcripts.
   During the trial, the defense tried to discredit government
witnesses, many of whom had serious criminal records. The
government contended that only such insiders could tell the story
of the alleged mob family.
   The government's star cooperating witness was Joseph Alonzo, a
diagnosed schizophrenic, admitted drug addict and alcoholic, and
convicted criminal who had shot one of the defendants _ his cousin
_ five times.
   Mrs. Bannigan said she did not take cooperating witnesses'
backgrounds into account.
   ``I'm not interested in criminal records,'' she said. ``I'm
interested in what he says and how he said it.''
   Before the jury was dismissed, Judge Harold A. Ackerman thanked
its 12 members. ``I commend you in the highest terms for your
dedication, your patience, your attentiveness.
   ``I'm just glad it's over,'' he said later, adding that he
planned to go on vacation as soon as possible.
   The government alleged the defendants operated out of the
Hole-in-the-Wall luncheonette in Newark, where pictures of
gangsters Al Capone and Meyer Lansky adorned the wall. Witnesses
testified about kisses of respect for the ``boss'' and ``tribute''
payments.
   According to the Administrative Office of the Courts in
Washington, the trial surpassed in length the so-called ``Pizza
Connection'' heroin smuggling case, which ended after 17 months in
March 1987.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Salvador Laurel
launched a new opposition movement today to challenge President
Corazon Aquino, claiming Mrs. Aquino will lead the country to
``national disaster'' if she remains in power.
   ``I accept the honor and the challenge to lead a coalesced
opposition against a blundering and immoral administration that has
betrayed the people,'' Laurel said in announcing formation of the
Union for National Action.
   The Union's platform calls for a new treaty on the status of
American military bases in the Philippines that would provide for a
gradual phasing out of the facilities.
   The vice president said his movement will serve as a watchdog on
government action and will expose alleged corruption.
   ``I am relieved that I no longer have to stand up beside the
president,'' said Laurel, chairman of the Union. ``If she continues
to run the government, the country is headed for national
disaster.''
   Laurel was joined at the Union's inaugural news conference by
Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile and leaders of several opposition groups,
including the New Society Movement of ousted President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   Mrs. Aquino ran under the banner of Laurel's United Nationalist
   Democratic Organization in February 1986 elections that led to
Marcos' ouster after 20 years in power.
   
   Two weeks ago, Laurel accused Mrs. Aquino of incompetence and
urged her to resign to make way for new elections, but he received
little popular support. Mrs. Aquino vowed to remain in office until
the end of her term in 1992.
   There was no immediate reaction from the president to formation
of the Union.
   The announcement by Laurel and Enrile was the latest in a series
of attempts to build a viable opposition movement. Previous
attempts have foundered because of personal rivalries.
   Enrile is the only opposition figure in the 23-member Senate,
and Laurel's political fortunes have been declining since
September, when he resigned as foreign secretary and refused to
serve in the Cabinet.
   Manila newspapers reported this month that 21 of 22 members of
Laurel's party in the House of Representatives were defecting to
pro-Aquino parties. Many members left the party last year.
   Enrile, fired as defense minister on Nov. 23, 1986, after a
failed coup by his followers, said the country was facing the
deepest crisis of its history because of ``a crisis of leadership.''
   Enrile, vice chairman of the Union, said opposition groups
rallied behind Laurel ``not for the self-interest of any one of us
... but above all to avert a potential, possible national tragedy.''
   In a statement to reporters, the Union called for negotiating a
new treaty with the United States on the status of American
military bases after their lease expires in 1991. The coalition
said a new treaty should be limited to 10 years and provide for
gradual phasing out of the six bases.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to say whether she would support a new
bases treaty.
   The Union also called for replacing the U.S.-style presidential
government with a parliamentary system.
   Mrs. Aquino abolished the unicameral legislative system imposed
by Marcos and replaced it with a Senate and House of
Representatives, returning to the system in force before the former
president declared eight years of martial law in 1972.
   The Union statement also called for stepping up the fight
against communist insurgents but offered to legalize the Communist
Party of the Philippines if it disavowed violence. The government
has made similar offers in the past.
   Mrs. Aquino originally named Laurel as prime minister of her
government but abolished the post soon afterward. Laurel had
complained since then that he was shunted aside by Mrs. Aquino's
advisers.
   Today's announcement came the day before the first anniversary
of the bloody Aug. 28, 1987, coup attempt, led by Enrile's former
protege, Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan. Honasan escaped from detention
last April and remains at large.
   The coup attempt was the strongest and most dangerous of the
half dozen attempts to topple the Aquino government. At least 53
people were killed and hundreds were wounded.

<TEXT>
   Carlos Batalla Cordero believes in ticket
scalping _ believes in it so strongly that he's founded a union and
gone on a hunger strike to promote honest, legal scalping.
   Batalla Cordero has been keeping a vigil at the doors of the
Metropolitan Cathedral here since Tuesday without eating. He has
asked for a meeting with President Miguel de la Madrid to press his
case for legalization.
   Ticket scalping is illegal, but it is much more common here than
in the United States. At almost any popular movie, scalpers called
``resellers'' buy tickets and sell them for a premium to latecomers
or to those who don't want to stand in line at the box office.
   Batalla Cordero, looking thin and unshaven during a Friday
interview, said he thought legalization might reduce some abuses.
   ``There are three people in Mexico City who have about 70 people
working for them who resell tickets for as much as 1,000 percent
more than they paid,'' said Batalla Cordero. He said they will
sometimes try to buy up all the tickets to an event to push up the
resale price.
   ``They mistreat and cheat their customers,'' said Batalla
Cordero. He said he believes scalpers should be limited to a 20
percent premium on the face value of the ticket. Nowadays, a ticket
to a popular play can cost $19 and be resold for as much as $86.
   Batalla has founded a union that claims about 80 members. The
union, called the Authentic Union of Independent Ticket Resellers
in the Service of the Public for Theater, Cinema and Spectacles,
has an office in Mexico City.
   ``The authorities have told me they won't answer my request for
an interview with the president until Monday,'' said Batalla
Cordero.
   Scalping was legalized in Mexico in 1952 but was outlawed again
in 1961. Telephone calls to the press offices at the National
Palace on Friday afternoon were not answered.
   Police at the cathedral said they had not seen Batalla Cordero
eat anything, although he has been taking liquids.

   Several American fighter jets
allegedly violated the airspace of this Caribbean island and
ignored orders by local air traffic controllers to leave,
newspapers and radio stations said.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said the reports Friday were being
investigated.
   Ham radio operators, who reported the incident to the local
press, monitored conversations between five jet pilots and air
traffic controllers on Wednesday and said the jets refused orders
to leave Barbadian airspace, the state-owned Caribbean Broadcasting
Corp. said.
   ``We have been informed by the Barbados government of an alleged
violation of its airspace by American aircraft,'' U.S. Embassy
Information Officer Mathew McGrath told The Associated Press.
   ``They (Barbadian officials) called us in to discuss the matter.
We are examining the report,'' he said.
   He said the aircraft carrier USS Independence passed near
Barbados, en route to San Diego from Norfolk Va. He would not say
if the jets that allegedly violated the airspace came from the
Independence.
   U.S. Embassy Charge d'Affaires John Clark met for 20 minutes
with Foreign Affairs Minister James Tudor on Thursday, said
McGrath. McGrath refused to say if Barbados made a formal complaint
to Tudor.

   Yonkers officials, continuing to defy a
housing desegregation plan upheld by a federal appeals court, plan
to ask the Supreme Court for relief from up to $1 million a day in
fines that could bankrupt the city.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday reaffirmed the
fines imposed by U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand against this
community just north of New York City. The fines had been stayed
pending the appeals court's ruling.
   The panel also upheld $500-a-day personal fines and the threat
of jail against four city councilmen found in contempt for refusing
to endorse the desegregation plan mandated by Sand.
   However, the court softened the fines against New York's
fourth-largest city, setting a $1 million-a-day cap instead of
letting them double each day as under the original order.
Otherwise, the three-judge panel said, the fines would reach
``unreasonable proportions.''
   The court also delayed reimposing the fines until Sept. 2,
allowing the city to seek a further stay of the penalty and a
chance to appeal the case to the nation's highest court.
   An appeal is planned, City Manager Neil DeLuca said.
   A few hours after the ruling, the seven-member City Council held
a weekly meeting to give the four recalcitrant councilmen a chance
to change their votes.
   But the four stuck to their position for the third time, making
the vote 4-3 against the plan.
   ``What I see here is the manipulation by the judiciary of a
legislative body,'' said one of the four, Councilman Henry
Spallone. ``I believe this is a miscarriage of justice.''
   The appeals court upheld the threat of imprisonment against the
councilmen after the 10th day of the penalties if they continue
blocking the plan.
   Councilman Nicholas Longo said the only reason there were any
``yes'' votes was ``intimidation and fear'' by the court.
   Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko told those attending the meeting that he
voted for the plan because he feared a contempt citation.
   The fines Sand imposed against the city Aug. 2 started at $100
but doubled daily and would have wiped out the city's $337 million
annual budget in less than a month.
   The fines and the countdown to the councilmen's jail time were
suspended Aug. 9 when the city and the councilmen appealed to the
2nd Circuit. The councilmen had been scheduled to go to jail Aug.
11.
   By Aug. 9, the city had paid $12,700 in fines and each
councilman had paid $3,500.
   Under the new timetable, Yonkers would pay $12,800 next Friday
and would reach the $1-million-a-day cap a week after that, at
which time the city would have paid more than $2.6 million in all.
The fines would be $1 million each day after that.
   Though Yonkers' budget for the year would be wiped out in about
11 months, the city would face bankruptcy long before that. A state
agency, the Financial Control Board, has taken over the city's
pursestrings, imposing spending restrictions and drafting a
worst-case plan.
   Secretary of State Gail Shaffer, who heads the control board,
said the state's declaration of a fiscal crisis would continue
``until the City Council acts to purge the city of its contempt.''
   Sand's contempt ruling was the most serious step in his
continuing battle to impose a plan to build hundreds of subsidized
apartments in Yonkers' predominantly white neighborhoods. That plan
stemmed from his 1985 landmark ruling that Yonkers had deliberately
segregated housing and schools for four decades.
   About 24 percent of the city's 200,000 residents are black or
Hispanic. The city is divided by highways that the courts have
ruled serve as racial barriers.
   Sand imposed the fines after the council refused, 4-3, to
endorse the housing plan by approving incentives for 800 units of
low cost housing throughout Yonkers.
   The vote reversed the council's 5-2 approval in January of the
same proposal, which the city had agreed to as part of a consent
decree.

<HEAD>Chairman Of New York Mercantile Exchange Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William M. Bradt, chairman of the New York
Mercantile Exchange, has resigned after the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission found he had acted inappropriately.
   The commission did not accuse Bradt of any illegal activity, nor
did it recommend he resign. An internal exchange inquiry in January
cleared Bradt of any wrongdoing.
   Bradt submitted his resignation Thursday night after a meeting
in which members of the Merc's board discussed the findings of the
commission's report. In today's editions, The New York Times quoted
unidentified sources close to the exchange as saying no vote on
whether Bradt should be ousted was taken at that meeting.
   Bradt, 42, became chairman of the Merc in March 1987. In a
statement issued late Thursday he said: ``I am pleased with the
findings contained in the C.F.T.C. report that at no time were any
exchange or C.F.T.C. rules or regulations violated. However, I
believe it is in the best interest of my business, my family and
the exchange, now that I have been vindicated, to step down as
chairman.''
   The Merc is the world's largest crude oil futures exchange. The
commission report followed an investigation that the exchange began
in November 1987 after exchange members accused Bradt and Kevin P.
Conway, then vice president for compliance, of improper business
relationships.
   The central issue concerned talks between the two men about
establishing a clearing business at the exchange. A clearing
business processes trades for fees.
   In January, the exchange board cleared Bradt of wrongdoing.
Conway, a lawyer, was dismissed and could face disbarment
proceedings.
   During Bradt's tenure, he clashed with fellow board members over
his desire to merge the Merc with the Commodity Exchange Inc.,
which is the world's largest precious metals futures exchange.
   Zoltan Guttman, 38, vice chairman of the Merc, was named to
succeed Bradt. He will serve out Bradt's two-year term, which
expires in March.

Allege Brutality</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet leaders have issued a decree giving
paramilitary police broad search and seizure powers and the
authority to keep public order at demonstrations. Activists say the
officers brutally put down recent protests.
   The Soviet media did not report on the measure issued Friday,
but they carried extensive dispatches on a decree that requires
advance permission for public demonstrations and meetings and sets
stiff fines and jail terms for violators.
   Demonstrations have become more frequent under Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or greater openness.
   The decree involving the paramilitary police also empowers the
officers to enter homes and businesses in pursuit of suspects,
seize autos and communications equipment and use a wide range of
weapons.
   Crowd control previously was the responsibility of regular
police, who along with the paramilitary police are governed by the
Interior Ministry. The paramilitary police until now had been
assigned only to guard prisons and labor camps and protect
government property and special shipments.
   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet approved the new decree July
28 and it was published in a legislative digest that reached
subscribers Friday. The measure was signed by President Andrei
Gromyko.
   Political activists say the paramilitary police turned up at a
demonstration Sunday in Moscow and during this year's unrest in
Armenia.
   ``In peacetime, the army is taking on extraordinary powers,''
said Yuri Mityunov, a leader of an unofficial opposition political
group called the Democratic Union. ``What is happening here is what
happens in other countries only under martial law.''
   Mityunov said the new measure gives paramilitary police _ not
regular police _ jurisdiction for the first time over political
meetings and demonstrations.
   Dissident journalist Sergei Grigoryants said alleged beatings at
Sunday's protest were unprecedented in recent times.
   On Sunday, the paramilitary police helped regular police stop a
Democratic Union protest in Moscow's Pushkin Square against the
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia 20 years ago.
   They wore khaki uniforms without insignias, black boots and
berets with Interior Ministry markings. More than 100 protesters
were arrested and dissidents said the paramilitaries beat and
kicked about 30 of them.
   Mityunov said some members of the force told those arrested they
had served in the Soviet army in Afghanistan.
   Paramilitary police units were reported in Armenia as early as
February, months before the decree. They helped quell
demonstrations by Armenians demanding the annexation of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian region attached to the
neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
   Under the decree, paramilitary police need not obtain a search
warrant from a prosecutor, as regular police are required to do.
Mityunov said this violates a constitutional provision of
inviolability of the home.
   Gorbachev told a special Communist Party conference June 28
there should be ``strict observance of the rights of citizens to
the inviolability of their private life, home, the secrecy of
telephone communication, postal and telegraph correspondence.''
   On Friday, Mityunov said: ``Gorbachev ... called for creation of
a state based on laws, but even in the times of (Soviet dictator
Josef) Stalin there weren't laws that openly violated the
constitution, such as this one does regarding inviolability.''
   The decree says the paramilitary police will be used to stop
violations of public order that have a ``mass character,'' threaten
people's lives and health, disrupt businesses and damage property.

   A Peruvian submarine collided with a Japanese

and 28 missing, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said today.
   The ministry said all the casualties were among the 53 crew
members of the submarine. Twenty-two of the submarine's crew
members were rescued, the ministry said.
   The ministry, quoting preliminary reports from the Japanese
Embassy in Lima, said the submarine collided with the No. 8
Kyowa-maru, a 412-ton tuna fishing boat, Friday evening. It said
there were 20 people on board the tuna boat.
   Ministry officials said the collision took place off Callao, a
port north of the capital city, Lima.
   The fishing boat suffered some cracks on the bow, ministry
officials said.
   Cause of the accident and other details were not immediately
available.

<HEAD>Poll: Many West Germans Indifferent To Hearing National Anthem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germans are about evenly divided
over whether they feel a tingle of pride when they hear their
country's national anthem, according to results of a poll.
   The survey also reported Friday that many university graduates
said they feel ``bothered'' when they hear the national anthem,
which was once called ``Deutschland Ueber Alles'' (Germany Above
Everything) but is now known simply as ``Deutschlandlied'' (German
Hymn).
   ``Deutschland Ueber Alles'' was a well-known symbol of Nazi
might under Adolf Hitler. The tune is still the country's national
anthem, but stanzas that moved millions of people to militant
fervor during Nazi times were dropped after World War II.
   According to the poll of 2,078 people conducted by the respected
Ipos surveying institute, 46.5 percent said they felt proud when
they heard the national anthem.
   But 48.3 percent said they felt indifferent or no pride when
hearing the anthem, and 5.2 percent said hearing it bothered them,
the institute reported.
   A total of 12.1 percent of the university graduates polled said
they are bothered when they hear the national anthem, the institute
said.
   The institute did not state the poll's margin of error.

<HEAD>Doctors Warn Of Blood Clot Risk On Long Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People on long flights should exercise their leg
muscles if they want to stay healthy, particularly if they are
flying coach when they might be more cramped and drinking alcohol
as well, doctors said.
   The three doctors from Britain and New York said in an article
published Friday that passengers on flights of four hours or more
risked a blood clot developing in the legs that could lead to chest
pains and heart failure.
   They said the problems could occur in any cramped conditions,
even if flying business- or first-class, but were more likely in
the economy section.
   They subtitled their article in the British medical journal The
Lancet ``The Economy Class Syndrome.''
   The article advised exercising the leg muscles while sitting,
getting up to walk around the aircraft from time to time and
avoiding alcohol, smoking and inside seats.
   ``High-risk subjects should consider (taking) low-dose aspirin
on either a permanent or temporary basis,'' they said.
   ``We are just trying to alert people to the possible danger of
long flights, particularly under cramped conditions or under
conditions of dehydration due to excessive alcohol,'' said Dr. John
M. Cruickshank, a cardiovascular consultant to Imperial Chemical
Industries, Britain's largest chemical company.
   Cruickshank wrote the article with Dr. Richard Gorlin of Mount
Sinai Medical Center, New York, and Dr. Bryan Jennett, a
neurosurgeon at Southern General Hospital, Glasgow.
   The two British doctors cited their own experiences of chest and
limb pains after long flights in Asia and across the Atlantic.
   The article said passengers were at risk even if they had no
history of heart disease.
   It cited a 1986 investigation into 61 sudden deaths over three
years at London's Heathrow airport which estimated that 18 percent
of them were due to blood clots.
   ``Our simple advice is to keep the legs moving, do muscle
exercises, go for little walks every once in a while and keep off
the heavy drinking which occurs on longer flights,'' said
Cruickshank.
   ``Alcohol causes dehydration, which makes this sort of
thrombosis more likely, and smoking can make the platelets in the
blood more sticky and encourage thrombosis,'' he said.

   An unusual ``moderate'' sized

   The quake measured 5.3 on the Richter scale, Jorgenson said. But
she said the USGS has not issued a tidal warning in connection with
the earthquake.
   ``It was felt strongly by the residents of Hamilton,'' she added.
   The USGS said Saturday's earthquake struck in the same area
where another quake hit last June 24. But ``it is unusual for a

   An unusual ``moderate'' earthquake hit
in the northern Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Bermuda today,
officials at the United States Geological Survey said.
   ``A moderate earthquake centered in the ocean about 80 miles
west of Hamilton, Bermuda struck at 3:05 a.m. EDT,'' said USGS
spokeswoman Pat Jorgenson.
   The quake measured 5.3 on the Richter scale, Jorgenson said. But
she said the USGS has not issued a tidal warning in connection with
the earthquake.
   ``It was felt strongly by the residents of Hamilton,'' she added.
   The Richter scale is an open-ended gauge of energy released by
an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake with a magnitude of 4 can cause moderate damage in a
populated area, a quake of magnitude 5 considerable damage, a
magnitude 6 quake severe damage, one of magnitude 7 widespread,
heavy damage and a magnitude 8 quake, a ``great'' earthquake
capable of tremendous damage.
   The USGS said today's earthquake struck in the same area where
another quake hit last June 24. But ``it is unusual for a quake to
hit in the north Atlantic. We have them in the southern Pacific all
the time,'' said one USGS official.
   There was no information immediately available about damages or
injuries, officials said.

<HEAD>Monsoon Moisture Lingers In Southwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A cold front bore down on the upper Mississippi Valley and the
central Plains early today, while thunderstorms in the Southwest
scattered monsoon moisture across the region, with most of the
deluge hitting Nevada and Utah.
   Nellis Air Force Base, near Las Vegas, received more than half
an inch of rain Friday night, while to the north Tonopah also
reported receiving nearly a half inch of rain in 30 minutes. The
downpour caused water to flow across the desert in northwest Clark
County, north of Las Vegas.
   Showers and thunderstorms drifted from southwest Utah into
northeast Arizona on Friday night, accompanied by brief, heavy
rains. Southern Utah reported minor flooding over Beaver County.
Showers and thunderstorms also developed over southern Death Valley.
   Thunderstorms swept through the central Plains into the western
Great Lakes region, with the strongest storms in northern Kansas
and eastern Colorado.
   Other showers and thunderstorms were scattered through eastern
Pennsylvania and the northwest and east-central coasts of Florida.
   Meanwhile, a tropical depression hovered over northeast Cuba,
about 300 miles southeast of Miami, late Friday, moving northwest
at 10 to 15 mph.
   Little change in strength was expected during the night but it
could strengthen today. If the depression is upgraded to a tropical
storm, it will be named Chris.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
from the upper Great Lakes region through the lower Missouri
Valley, and from the central and southern Plains into the central
Rockies; numerous showers and thunderstorms from upper Michigan
into eastern and southern Wisconsin, and across the Colorado
Rockies; and showers and thunderstorms across northern Arizona and
southern Utah, over Florida and eastern parts of the southern
Atlantic Coast.
   High temperatures were forecast to be in the 80s or 90s across
much of the nation; in the 70s from the northern and central
Rockies through the middle Missouri Valley into the lower Great
Lakes and the upper Ohio Valley; in the 60s from the northern
Plains into the northern Great Lakes region; from 100 to 105
degrees from the Rio Grande Valley into north central Texas; and
100-110 degrees from the desert Southwest into the California
valleys.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 45
degrees at Alpena, Mich., and Butte and Havre, Mont., to 94 degrees
at Phoenix.

   The parents of a rape victim who spent
more than a year pursuing their daughter's attacker say they never
suspected the man they helped capture would be linked to almost 70
rapes.
   Robert Biddings, a 34-year-old restaurant dishwasher, remained
in custody Friday night on a 21-count indictment alleging he raped
five people, including the couple's daughter and a 12-year-old
girl, between 1986 and March 1988.
   Franklin County Prosecutor Michael Miller said the county grand
jury is expected to review evidence from other rape cases next week.
   The parents, who asked not to be identified by name, said at a
news conference Friday after the indictment was released that they
were compelled by rage to pursue the man who raped their
23-year-old daughter.
   Their persistence led to Bidding's arrest Monday. The Columbus
man was indicted on 12 counts of rape, six counts of kidnapping,
two counts of aggravated robbery and one count of felonious assault.
   Police said Biddings is a suspect in more than five dozen rapes
attributed to the ``Handcuff Rapist,'' a nickname that resulted
from the use of handcuffs in early attacks later attributed to the
same man over a four-year period.
   The couple said they decided to pursue the rapist shortly after
the June 1987 attack on their daughter. At first, they staked out
the bus stop where the rape occured.
   When that failed to produce results, they decided to use the
victim's mother as a decoy. The woman stood at the bus stop while
her armed husband waited nearby.
   The couple said they repeated the ploy only a few times before
the wife was attacked Aug. 5. Her husband scared off the assailant,
and gave police the license number from his vehicle.
   ``I wasn't afraid, I was furious,'' the woman said. ``That is
every parent's first reaction: I'll go out and get the person who
did this to my child.''
   Columbus police, who had placed decoys in areas around the city
after the attack, warned the couple that staking out the scene of
the crime was dangerous.
   But, said the victim's father, ``They (police) have thousands of
cases very similar to this. They can't drop everything they're
doing to work on one case. I was not hesitant at taking the law
into my own hands.''
   He said he was more afraid that his wife would be attacked by a
mugger or purse snatcher than by their daughter's attacker.
   At the news conference, the couple and their daughter sat behind
a screen that allowed them to be seen only in silhouette.
   The mother, who sat rigid and unsmiling, said she and her family
did not anticipate the attention their actions would draw.
   ``We're private people. We did what we had to do and don't feel
we should get any credit for doing anything. We're embarrassed. I'm
very embarrassed,'' the mother said.
   But their daughter said the incident has helped her through a
rough time. ``Yes, it gives me hope,'' she said, adding a message
to other victims. ``Don't be afraid to step forward ... because
even though he has assaulted you and it's all said and done, maybe
you can stop him from assaulting someone else and stop someone else
from going through the pain.''
   The mother and daughter sought counseling after the initial
attack, but the mother said she stopped going. The counselor later
asked her to come back and talk about her problems.
   ``I said, `Why? To get rid of the rage?' And I said, `I won't be
back because I don't want to get rid of the rage. Not before we get
him.'''

<HEAD>Party Leader Indicates Government Ready To Compromise</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES thruout with Politburo member saying party will meet

excluded from talks; more quotes from Jaruzelski.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A communist party leader said today the
government is ready to ``meet half-way'' demands for trade union
freedom that gave rise to a wave of strikes crippling coal mines,
docks and factories.
   There were other signs that authorities had adopted a more open
stance toward talking with strikers, who are demanding legalization
of Solidarity and higher wages.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said proposed round-table talks
between Polish officials and worker representatives would not
exclude Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, urged fellow party
leaders to use ``courage'' and ``unconventional means'' to solve
economic and social problems that led to the labor unrest.
   Polish newspapers printed in full a statement from Roman
Catholic bishops calling for dialogue and for rejection of force in
settling strikes.
   Strikes continued at 12 enterprises, but there were no reports
of police actions to end them.
   Jaruzelski said today's meeting of the 230-member central
committee of the Polish United Workers Party would work out a
program to remove threats to people's living standards, improve the
market stability, and speed reconciliation within society.
   ``In short what is needed is a brave turn,'' he said, opening
the plenum, parts of which were televised. ``Courage to break the
stereotypes, limitations and barriers. Courage to use
unconventional but most of all effective means.''
   Jaruzelski denied the meeting was a direct result of strikes.
   ``The situation is complex, but we have not lost control even
for a moment,'' he said. The goal of the meeting is to make a
``critical and self-critical analysis of the causes for the present
tensions,'' Jaruzelski said.
   Politburo member Jozef Czyrek said the party was ready ``to meet
half-way'' demands for trade union pluralism. ``However we will
oppose ideas which would give rise to conflicts,'' he said.
   The meeting came after Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak
on Friday night proposed broad-based ``round-table'' talks with
representatives of workers.
   Urban, asked in a telephone interview if Kiszczak's proposal
would exclude Walesa, replied, ``No.''
   ``The proposal is directed at all who do not reject the existing
legal and constitutional order,'' he said. ``One may also
understand this as those who behave, or are ready to behave, in a
way complying with the law.''
   Poland is struggling with 60 percent inflation, and the
government this year has raised prices an average of 40 percent in
an effort to help the stagnant economy.
   Strikes began Aug. 16 at coal mines in southwestern Poland and
evolved into Poland's worst labor unrest since 1981. The strikes of
1981 ended in a martial-law crackdown that crushed Solidarity,
which was outlawed a year later.
   Lech Walesa, who founded Solidarity in 1980, said authorities
asked how he felt about possible negotiations.
   ``I am ready unconditionally and without any thematic
restrictions to start talks at any time,'' Walesa said Friday in a
statement brought out of the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, where he
works as an electrician and is participating in a strike.
   Roman Catholic bishops, in their first statement on the strikes
in this predominantly Catholic nation, issued a statement urging
negotiation.
   ``Intimidation and force must be abandoned, and the reasonable
voice of all the citizens of the country must be loyally
acknowledged,'' it said.
   Their message was released after a meeting at the Jasna Gora
shrine in Czestochowa. ``The whole nation is again experiencing
dramatic shocks,'' they said, and the ``fundamental cause of the
country's present political-social situation is the violation of
human rights and the dignity of labor.''
   In recent days, the government has used a combination of limited
force, displays of strength and propaganda against the strikers.
Police have evicted striking miners in southwestern Poland and
transit workers in the Baltic port of Szczecin.
   Repeating their position that the government should permit union
pluralism, which Solidarity and the strikers demand, the bishops
said: ``Dialogue must be accepted as the basis for solving all
social conflicts.''
   They also implicitly criticized the government for not honoring
agreements signed with workers in 1980. ``The social accords signed
eight years ago and developed with such difficulty remain a task to
be fulfilled,'' they said.
   Those agreements recognized Solidarity, the first free union in
the Soviet bloc, and included guarantees relating to working
conditions and social and political rights. Key provisions were
voided after the military crackdown in 1981.

<HEAD>Sabotaged O-Rings Not Installed in Shuttle, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Damaged O-rings destined for space shuttle
rockets were apparently sabotaged, but they were caught before they
could be installed in boosters, officials said as NASA and the FBI
investigated.
   However, a former Morton Thiokol employee told a television
station Friday that a deliberately cut O-ring was put in a rocket
segment being assembled at the booster maker's northern Utah plant.
   The 1986 Challenger disaster was blamed on a faulty O-ring that
allowed superhot exhaust gases to escape through a booster joint,
igniting the shuttle's external fuel tank and killing the
seven-member crew.
   A ``very small number'' of O-rings that appeared to have been
deliberately cut were discovered in June, said HydraPak Inc. Vice
President James Dockstader, whose company makes the rings under
contract to Morton Thiokol.
   The discovery was immediately reported to the FBI, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Morton Thiokol,
Dockstader said Friday.
   The FBI is investigating the possibility of sabotage, said agent
Cal Clegg, who declined to elaborate.
   NASA Inspector General Bill Colvin likewise refused to discuss
his agency's probe, but said NASA officials believed none of the
damaged O-rings ever reached Morton Thiokol and that their
discovery would not affect plans to launch shuttle Discovery.
   The nation's first shuttle mission since the Challenger tragedy
is expected to be scheduled for late next month or early October.
   Dockstader said a check determined none of the flawed seals was
shipped from HydraPak's plant in suburban West Jordan to Morton
Thiokol, Dockstader said.
   ``The damaged O-rings were immediately secured,'' Dockstader
said. ``No O-rings have been shipped from HydraPak with any kind of
damage.
   ``HydraPak has taken steps to prevent similar incidents in the
future and is confident the problem is now resolved,'' he added.
   NASA spokesman Dwayne Brown said ``extensive inspection and
quality control procedures'' found the damage before the O-rings
left HydraPak's plant.
   But a former Morton Thiokol employee told television station
KTVX he saw a flawed O-ring placed in a rocket segment.
   ``I was there when they received the damaged O-ring, and it was
labeled from HydraPak, and it was in a package that had gone
through quality assurance at Morton Thiokol,'' said the worker, who
was not identified.
   The man said that when he called attention to the flawed seal he
was told to keep quiet because the exposure could cause further
delays in the space shuttle program.
   Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab denied the allegations.
   ``No unacceptable component has either been delivered to us or
been delivered by us for use in the shuttle program,'' Raab said.
   He said the company conducts extensive inspections of shuttle
parts. Inspection records show there was ``virtually no possibility
that any damaged O-ring has ever gotten into the flight hardware,''
Raab said.
   J.R. Thompson, director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center
in Huntsville, Ala., said some HydraPak employees were suspected of
damaging O-rings to win cash bonuses awarded to workers who found
defects.
   Dockstader denied such an incentive program existed, saying
Thompson was ``either misinformed or misquoted.''
   Former HydraPak inspector Cathy Crocker said she discovered
three O-rings with slash marks as early as May, but management was
unable to determine who was responsible.
   After more cuts were found, Crocker said she was asked to take a
lie-detector test, and agreed because she had ``nothing to hide.''
   ``I took the test and I failed it,'' she told KSL-TV.
   She said that when cuts continued to surface in some O-rings,
she was moved to a filing job and asked to resign.
   Dockstader said no employees were fired because of the
investigations, but wouldn't say whether any were disciplined.
   He said security at HydraPak's plant was strict, including
employee badges for admission and escorts for visitors.
   But Crocker said security was lax and that anyone could walk
into the plant.

<HEAD>Geography Now A Required Course At University Of Colorado</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a University of Colorado student
asked, ``Is New England a separate country?'' action was taken to
make sure the astonishing question wouldn't burn the ears of
faculty again.
   The college has a new requirement for beginning arts and
sciences students of all majors: a geography course.
   ``There had been some deterioration in what we used to think of
as `basic knowledge,''' said Ron James, editor of the Colorado
Alumnus newspaper.
   Bonnie Mahler, an assistant in the School of Arts and Sciences,
said the push to include a geography requirement has won wide
support because the subject is relevant to many disciplines.
   The mandate is part of a larger curriculum reform being
implemented, officials said.
   In most cases, students have a number of options to meet
requirements, but in geography, there are just two choices _ human
geography or international geography.
   Both are designed to give students a ``geographical
perspective'' during the first or second semester.
   Students who can demonstrate a competence in geography on an
entrance exam or who took a similar course in high school are
excused, but officials say most students will have to take one of
the courses.

   Israeli troops shot and critically wounded a
Palestinian man today when youths streamed into the streets and
hurled rocks at soldiers after a two-day curfew was lifted, an Arab
reporter and hospital officials said.
   Leaders of the Palestinian uprising called for attacks on Arabs
working for the Israeli government. Hospital officials said troops
shot and wounded two people, including a 9-year-old girl, who
defied curfews Friday in the West Bank.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, 18-year-old Muhamad Barash, of the
Bureij refugee camp, was shot in the abdomen and listed in
``dangerous'' condition at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital, an Arab
reporter said. The bullet penetrated his kidney, a hospital
official said.
   About 30 other Bureij residents complained they were beaten when
the army conducted house-to-house searches during the night, said
the reporter, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Most were
treated at a local clinic but a 13-year-old was hospitalized, he
said.
   Bureij had been under curfew for two days when the restriction
was lifted Friday night. The Arab reporter said as soon as the
curfew ended, youths streamed into the streets to hurl rocks at
soldiers.
   A military spokesman said he knew only that there were riots in
Gaza. He did not confirm the shootings.
   The army maintained a curfew on the West Bank's largest city,
Nablus.
   The latest leaflet issued this week by the underground
leadership of the Palestinian uprising threatened reprisals against
Arabs in Israeli-appointed positions.
   ``Striking forces will direct blows against those who refuse to
resign from their posts on August 27,'' it said.
   The call for such resignations has been a consistent one
throughout the more than 8-month-old revolt, and hundreds of
Palestinian policemen have resigned their posts.
   Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel have been
the targets of violence by other Palestinians. In the latest case,
masked men hacked a suspected collaborator to death Thursday in the
West Bank.
   Israel's Minister of Economics and Planning, Gad Ya'acobi, said
the intefadeh, Arabic for ``uprising,'' is costing Israel $1.7
million a day, the Itim news agency said. The report gave no
further details.
   It was not the first time Ya'acobi, of the left-leaning Labor
party, pointed a finger at the uprising to explain recent Israeli
economic ills. He said Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 also
wreaked havoc on the economy, Itim said.
   Since it began Dec. 8, the Palestinian revolt against Israel's
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip _ seized from Jordan and
Egypt in 1967 _ has claimed 254 Arab lives. Four Israelis have died.
   Minister-without-portfolio Moshe Arens, of the right-wing Likud
party, called for talks with residents of the occupied territories
after allowing them to hold free elections to choose
representatives.
   Speaking on Israel's Arabic television service, he said he
doubted PLO figures would be elected if truly free elections were
to be held in the territories.
   Polls however indicate most Palestinians regard the Palestine
Liberation Organization as their sole legitimate representative

   Using the Israeli biblical names for the West Bank, Arens said,
``We know that in Judea and Samaria today, there are a whole host
of terrorist organizations; there are attempts to frighten people;
there are attempts to force the PLO's will on people.''
   In Nablus on Friday, a hospital official who spoke on condition
of anonymity said a 9-year-old girl was shot in the leg when she
ran out of her house in defiance of curfew.
   An Arab reporter said the girl mistook an army loudspeaker
announcement extending the curfew for the type of announcement
normally made to broadcast the end of confinement.
   A 23-year-old resident was also shot in the leg, but the
circumstances were unclear, an Arab reporter said.
   Nablus has been under curfew for two days.
   A military spokesman said she had no knowledge of the shootings,
but she did not deny the report.

   South Florida braced for heavy rain today and the
Bahamas warned boaters to stay ashore as a tropical depression
dumped rains on the Caribbean and threatened to strengthen as it
moved over the southern Bahamas.
   The weather system, moving west-northwest at 10 to 15 mph, has
caused at least three deaths and forced hundreds of evacuations due
to swollen rivers and mudslides as it moved across the northern
edge of the Caribbean on Friday.
   At 6 a.m. today, the broad, poorly defined center of the
depression was estimated to be about 225 miles southeast of Miami.
   A reconnaissance plane reported highest sustained winds near 35
mph, with tropical storm-force gusts of up to 45 mph in squalls
over Bahamian waters on the northern edge of the system.
   ``These thunderstorms are spreading into the central Bahamas and
should continue spreading into the northwestern Bahamas later in
the day,'' Max Mayfield, a forecaster for the National Hurricane
Center in Coral Gables, said today.
   ``Tonight, this poorly defined center should be near the
southeast Florida coast, and the scenario now is for it to continue
northwest toward Florida with the heaviest activity offshore,'' he
said. ``Even if it were to intensify a little bit, it would still
be a minimal tropical storm.''
   Mayfield said the storm was more likely to brush the southeast
coast and keep the heavy activity off the water, rather than
hitting the Florida Keys directly.
   Bahamian officials issued a tropical storm watch for the
northwestern and central Bahamas, according to the center, advising
small craft to remain in port.
   If the depression attains tropical-storm strength, it will be
called Chris.
   Depressions are upgraded to tropical storms and named when their
maximum sustained winds reach 39 mph, and become hurricanes when
maximum sustained winds hit 74 mph.
   Depressions tend to weaken and become erratic over land, and
strengthen over open waters.
   The official Cuban news agency La Prensa said Friday that civil
defense authorities in four eastern provinces moved thousands of
people to higher ground.
   The depression, which began forming Sunday in the central
Atlantic, dumped 6.6 inches of rain on Puerto Rico in a 24-hour
period ending Thursday, and then dumped more than 5 inches on the
Dominican Republic, forecasters said.
   Two men and a 12-year-old boy were killed in Puerto Rico in two
separate accidents Wednesday when trees crushed their cars as they
were driving along rural roads, police said.
   More than 100 homes around the island were seriously damaged by
flooding, including two that were destroyed, according to Civil
Defense officials in Puerto Rico. They also reported mudslides and
damaged highways and bridges.
   Two tropical storms have developed so far in the Atlantic during
this year's hurricane season, but neither reached hurricane
strength. The season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

   Another 1,200 Army soldiers underwent training to help
hard-pressed civilian crews battle Western wildfires so numerous a
blaze in Washington state burned out of control today because there
was no one to fight it.
   ``We are really stretched thin on (firefighting) forces right
now,'' state Department of Natural Resources spokesman Rob Harper
said Friday as the 5,000-acre blaze burned on the Colville Indian
Reservation in northeast Washington.
   At Yellowstone National Park, rangers escorted tourists down
roads otherwise closed by fires, and residents of a town on the
edge of the park were told they might have to evacuate. Wildfires
also threatened two Oregon communities.
   Fires also charred woodlands in parts of California, Utah and
Idaho.
   Two more Army battalions, about 1,200 soldiers, from Fort Lewis,
Wash., were being trained to fight fires, according to the Boise
Interagency Fire Center, which coordinates Western firefighting
efforts.
   The soldiers will be flown to Montana on Sunday and Monday to
help fight fires in Yellowstone, said Maj. Frank Ham, an Army
spokesman.
   About 1,200 Fort Lewis soldiers are already fighting blazes in
and near the nation's oldest national park. ``We're told they're
doing a great job,'' Ham said.
   At Yellowstone on Friday, two convoys of up to 350 cars took
visitors from one side of the park to the other in safety after a
ranger checked the road between the Yellowstone communities of
Canyon and Norris.
   The tourists ``think it's a big adventure,'' said Ranger Mona
Devine. ``Of course, some of the people are upset.''
   The convoys filed past the 114,000-acre ``North Fork'' fire, one
of 10 involving more than 400,000 acres of the park.
   Winds, which kicked up the fire on Thursday, on Friday helped
firefighters by rolling the blaze back on itself, said fire
official Troy Corn.
   Just outside Yellowstone's northeast entrance, a 36,000-acre
blaze in the Absaroka-Beartooth wilderness in south-central Montana
came within four miles of Cooke City, and evacuation plans were
readied for 500 to 1,000 people, officials said.
   But the warning was lifted when shifting winds pushed the fire
away from the town.
   ``It's too early to say for sure, but it's looking pretty
good,'' said Forest Service spokesman Steve Waterman.
   Yellowstone stopped charging its $10 entry fee Wednesday because
of the inconvenience fires created for visitors.
   Park facilities at Grant Village, Lewis Lake, Norris, Canyon,
Pebble Creek and Madison remained closed Friday.
   The park's west entrance was re-opened Friday, although
intermittent closures were expected.
   From the south entrance, the Rockefeller Memorial Parkway
leading into Grand Teton National Park also was closed, because of
a 21,500-acre fire in the Bridger-Teton National Forest.
   About 1,520 firefighters, including about 600 soldiers from Fort
Lewis, battled the 162,700-acre Clover-Mist fire burning in the
park and in steep, rugged terrain in the Shoshone National Forest.
   Elsewhere, some residents of Maxville, Mont., a town of about
two dozen households 90 miles southwest of Helena, began trickling
back when a fire that forced them to evacuate turned west after
coming as close as three miles, said fire information officer
Palmer Bowen.
   The fire earlier forced closure of the main road through the
area, destroyed a trailer home and two bulldozers and chased fire
crews out of a mining camp in the Deerlodge National Forest.
   In southwestern Oregon, the lightning-sparked Walker Mountain
fire crept within a half mile of a subdivision of about 1,000
people north of Grants Pass. In the northeastern corner of the
state, the Ward Canyon fire spread to within a mile of the tiny
community of Troy, authorities said.
   Both communities were placed on evacuation alert. The Ward
Canyon blaze had burned 15 unoccupied structures, mostly hunting
cabins.
   About 120 second-grade children from the Fir Point Bible Camp
were taken to a school about 25 miles north of Grants Pass ``as a
precautionary move'' after the Woods Creek fire grew to 500 acres,
said Jim Fisher, a state Forestry Department spokesman. He said the
children headed home Friday and the fire was 75 percent contained.
   Also in the state's northeast corner, the Tepee Butte fire
exploded to 26,300 acres of grass and timber by Friday night from
150 acres Thursday afternoon, and firefighters said it could spread
to as many as 80,000 acres.
   ``It appears as though we may have lost the left flank of that
fire,'' said Wallowa-Whitman National Forest spokeswoman Gail
Aschenbrenner.

   Fires near the famous Inca ruins of Machu
Picchu have charred at least 15,000 acres, burning trees and
grasslands in several mountain valleys near Cuzco, authorities say.
   But firefighting specialist Wayne Langlois said the fires, many
of them burning since early this month, were not endangering any
ancient sites, including the mountaintop tourist attraction of
Machu Picchu, 40 miles northwest of Cuzco.
   Langlois, of the British Columbia Forest Service in Canada, and
three anti-fire technicians arrived in Peru last week to advise
local officials how to combat the recurring blazes.
   Five hundred soldiers and civilians battling the fires have been
hampered by remote terrain and a shortage of modern equipment such
as chemicals and aircraft, Civil Defense authorities said Friday.
   Langlois said he flew over the burning areas but saw no damage
to farms or any of the stone buildings, bridges, terraced fields
and other ruins of the pre-Hispanic cultures that dot the Cuzco
region.
   Langlois said he believed peasants burning off tough grass for
planting, a traditional practice in the Andes, were accidentally
sparking new fires. Civil Defense authorities say the blazes have
spread because of the extremely dry conditions this year in the
Peruvian highlands.

<HEAD>Report: Information From Second US Soldier Led To Arrest Of
Ringleader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A second former U.S. soldier
involved in a spy ring that sold secrets to the Soviets apparently
provided information that led to the arrest of the alleged
ringleader, a West German newspaper said today.
   The Die Welt newspaper of Bonn also said that ``no charges have
been filed against the (second) American citizen, although he is
still in the Federal Republic.''
   The man alleged to have led the ring, former U.S. Army Sgt.
Clyde Lee Conrad, remained in prison today, facing espionage
charges carrying a maximum 10-year sentence.
   Conrad allegedly paid another U.S. soldier ``a five-figure sum''
for obtaining secret NATO information, according to chief West
German prosecutor Kurt Rebmann.
   ``The information that led to the arrest of the alleged
international spy ringleader, former U.S. Army Sgt. Clyde Lee
Conrad, apparently came from the U.S. Army soldier who was
recruited by Conrad to provide information after Conrad left the
service in 1985,'' the conservative Die Welt said.
   Although the West Germans say the second American was a soldier
when he was recruited for espionage, the Washington Post quoted
administration sources as saying the man has since left the Army.
   In Washington, a U.S. official said Friday that Conrad had a top
secret security clearance before leaving the U.S. Army.
   The U.S. official also conceded that Conrad was never subjected
to a periodic follow-up investigation during the time he held the
high-security clearance.
   West German and U.S. news media reports have said the spy ring
sold the Soviets secret documents about nuclear missile bases,
military pipelines and NATO troop strength. Officials say the ring
started operating in the late 1970s.
   According to a report Friday night on CBS News, the 41-year-old
Conrad collected more than $1 million for peddling the secrets.
   CBS attributed the report to a West German newspaper that it did
not identify.
   West German investigators have said they believe Conrad kept the
money in numbered Swiss bank accounts.

<TEXT>
   The chief Soviet delegate to the superpower
nuclear test negotiations said today the new round of talks with
the United States should become ``a milestone event.''
   The two delegations arrived in Geneva today for the third round
of talks, which begin Monday after a two-month break.
   Both delegation leaders expressed hope the two sides would
conclude protocols for verifying two existing treaties that limit
nuclear tests to 150 kiloton explosions.
   The verification, or anti-cheating, protocols under negotiation
apply to the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976 Peaceful
Nuclear Explosions Treaty. Both treaties were signed but never have
been ratified, though both countries say they are abiding by the
accords.
   The United States has said it will not ratify the treaties until
adequate provisions are made for verifying Soviet compliance with
the pacts.
   This round of negotiations ``should become a milestone event in
the dialogue between the U.S.S.R. and the United States on this
important problem of nuclear disarmament,'' chief Soviet delegate
Igor Palenykh told reporters.
   The two countries conducted a joint verification experiment Aug.
17 in Nevada, where Soviet officials for the first time witnessed
and monitored a U.S. nuclear test, using their own equipment.
   U.S. officials are scheduled to go to Moscow next month for a
similar experiment at the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground on
Sept. 14.
   Palenykh said as soon as the verification protocols for the two
existing treaties are signed, the two countries could begin
negotiating a nuclear test ban treaty.
   The current talks are to recess briefly for the September joint
test and then are set to resume in Geneva.

   A powerful bomb strapped to a
motorscooter exploded in a crowded market in Punjab state today,
killing two people and injuring 30, police said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but police said
they suspected Sikh militants, who are fighting for a separate
homeland in the northern border state.
   The explosion occurred at 10:30 a.m. in Ajanala, about 20 miles
south of Amritsar, according to Senior Magistrate G.S. Mann. The
blast damaged several Hindu shops and vehicles parked in the area,
he said.
   Ten people were seriously injured and taken to nearby hospitals,
he said.
   Sikhs comprise less than 2 percent of India's 880 million
people, but they are a majority in Punjab, a rich agricultural
state bordering Pakistan.
   Sikh militants claiming discrimination by India's Hindu majority
have been waging a war for secession since 1982. At least 4,500
people have been killed in Sikh violence, including nearly 1,800 so
far this year.

<TEXT>
   Benazir Bhutto, who may become the
first woman in modern history to lead an Islamic country, is edging
her leftist party toward the center in hopes of winning
middle-class and army support.
   She is confident her Pakistan People's Party will win elections
scheduled for Nov. 16 and hopeful that democracy will be restored
after 11 years of military rule.
   When President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq died Aug. 17 in a plane crash
that some officials blamed on sabotage, Ms. Bhutto urged political
leaders to act responsibly to avoid provoking a military coup.
   ``I have no doubt that in free and open elections, the Pakistan
People's Party will take a majority,'' Ms. Bhutto recently told
Western reporters at her home.
   The 35-year-old opposition leader is the daughter and political
heir of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the last freely elected prime
minister, who was ousted by Zia in a 1977 military coup and ordered
hanged two years later.
   Bhutto had two sons and another daughter, but he doted on
Benazir and groomed her in the hope that she might one day be the
counterpart to India's late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
   ``My father taught each one of us to believe that it's not
important whether you are a man or a woman, what is important is
what sort of person you are,'' said Ms. Bhutto, who studied at
Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Mass., before studying law at
Oxford.
   Ms. Bhutto returned to Pakistan to lead the unsuccessful
struggle to stop her father's execution. After his death, she
denounced Zia's military rule and spent five years in jail or under
house arrest before she was allowed to go into self-imposed exile
in Europe.
   Despite the suffering inflicted on her family by Zia, Ms. Bhutto
said she was not motivated by revenge.
   ``My mother became ill and couldn't lead the struggle. The
people who had been jailed or tortured under the general looked to
me and I saw I had a duty to them,'' she said.
   Since her return from self-exile in 1986, Ms. Bhutto has spoken
at rallies attended by hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis. They
chant her name, wait for hours to catch a glimpse of her and listen
spellbound as she speaks.
   Some Pakistanis, including many in the army and the government
bureaucracy, remember her father as a tyrant who crushed his
opponents. But millions of poor Pakistanis still think of Bhutto as
a hero who sought to lead them out of deep poverty and oppression.
They regard Ms. Bhutto as a daughter faithful to his memory and
promises.
   Bhuttoism, the creed developed by the prime minister, was a
vague mix of democracy, socialism and Islam. ``Food, clothing and
shelter for all,'' was Bhutto's most popular slogan.
   Ms. Bhutto remains a committed populist and has promised to
redistribute 10 million acres of state land to landless peasants if
she takes power.
   But the policies that attract the downtrodden frighten
Pakistan's more conservative voters.
   ``Our political message has been based on social and economic
justice so women, minorities and the working classes have looked to
us. Now we are trying to make a bridge between our traditional
constituents and the middle class,'' Ms. Bhutto said.
   She has said that Western-style capitalism is the key to
Pakistan's development and that her party will work to attract
foreign investment, but she promised no sweeping nationalizations.
   Although the shift to the center puts her in conflict with the
left-wing, anti-American wing of her party, it enables her to
negotiate with the moderate-conservative Muslim League, a potential
coalition partner.
   Pakistan's prime minister is selected from the party that wins a
majority in the National Assembly. Ms. Bhutto's party is expected
to take the largest number of votes, but the Muslim League also is
expected to draw substantial support.
   The Muslim League was considered a Zia tool until its leader,
Mohammad Khan Junejo, was ousted as prime minister by Zia in May.
Now the party is in serious disarray, but Junego is expected to
rally his supporters behind him and attract independent votes.
   If he is not allied with Ms. Bhutto by November, Junejo could be
a formidable opponent to her bid for prime minister.
   Ms. Bhutto said if she is elected, she would also resolve the
ethnic and sectarian disputes that threaten to turn Pakistan into
the Lebanon of the subcontinent.
   Shiite Moslems, who make up 5 percent of the population, have
been in conflict with the majority Sunni Moslems over Pakistan's
foreign policy and domestic law.
   Armed groups in the southern province of Sind are demanding
autonomy and say they are treated unfairly by the central
government, which is dominated by Punjabis. Zia, a Sunni Moslem,
was from the northern Punjab province.
   Ms. Bhutto blamed Zia for the divisions and said that by
dissolving the national assembly and restricting political parties
he eliminated avenues for resolving disputes.
   ``By restoring a political culture, reintroducing a
representative parliament and by being a national party, we can
pull these people together from the different regions to talk,``
she said. ``My father did it in the 1970s and we can do it now,
although it won't happen overnight.''
   Ms. Bhutto, who married a Karachi businessman in December in a
traditional Islamic arranged marriage, is expecting her first child.
   News reports say the baby is due in December, but sources close
to the family, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the baby
would arrive in the next six weeks.
   Ms. Bhutto declined to discuss her pregnancy, but she said Zia
set the elections for November ``as an inconvenience to my health.''
   ``You can't really interfere too much with nature,'' she said.
``But I do believe motherhood and politics do not conflict. We all
grew up believing in careers.''

<HEAD>Ailing Black Leader Poses Difficult Dilemma For Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Although most blacks in South Africa have never
heard his voice, never read his statements, never seen his picture,
Nelson Mandela has become a legendary figure to them in their
struggle for political rights. Now he is an increasingly
troublesome problem for the government. Here is a report on Mandela
by a longtime Associated Press correspondent in South Africa.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Through 26 years behind bars
in South African jails, Nelson Mandela has grown into a mythic
symbol of black resistance to apartheid.
   Now 70 and stricken with tuberculosis, the international stature
of the leader of the African National Congress is at a peak and he
is locked in a test of wills with President P.W. Botha that will
have a profound impact on their country's future.
   Since Mandela was hospitalized Aug. 12, Botha has come under
unprecedented pressure, here and abroad, to free the man many
believe would be president if black South Africans could vote.
   More than ever before, Botha has indicated he is ready to
oblige, saying he wants to ``act in a humane way'' toward a
prisoner ``in a special category of his own.''
   But commentators across the political spectrum say Botha has
become as much a prisoner as Mandela, caught in a dilemma with no
easy escape.
   Keeping Mandela in jail will intensify the international
protests and pose the risk of a furious response by blacks if their
most esteemed leader dies behind bars.
   Freeing an unrepentant Mandela will outrage right-wing whites
and could revive militant black opposition activity that has been
heavily suppressed under a 26-month-old state of emergency.
   These conflicting pressures leave Botha in a bind. Government
officials say he is unlikely to choose the bolder option of release
without some sort of concession from Mandela, such as tacit
acceptance of the government's demand that he renounce the use of
violence.
   Mandela's supporters believe he will accept nothing short of
unconditional freedom. They recall 1986, when Mandela said he would
not renounce violence until the government lifted its ban on the
African National Congress, scrapped the segregation laws of
apartheid, and agreed to negotiate the granting of political rights
to the nation's 26 million black majority.
   ``There is no violence worse than apartheid,'' wrote black
newspaper editor Khulu Sibiya. ``If one were to weigh the violence
of apartheid and that for which Mr. Mandela was imprisoned, that of
Mr. Mandela is like a Sunday school picnic.''
   Calls for Mandela's release are coming not only from blacks and
white liberals, but also from some conservative whites. The
pro-government, Afrikaans-language newspaper Beeld incurred Botha's
wrath this month for twice urging that Mandela be freed.
   Some analysts argue that the exiled leadership of the ANC, the
major guerrilla group fighting the white-ruled government, benefits
more with Mandela behind bars than if he were free.
   ``As long as he is in jail, he cannot make a mistake. And yet he
might, once free, especially because people have high expectations
from him,'' said Chris Maritz, a political science professor at the
University of Potchefstroom.
   Mike Hough, director of the Institute for Strategic Studies at
University of Pretoria, suggested that some ANC leaders might
prefer that Mandela die in jail. This would give the ANC a martyr
and avoid a possible ideological split in the guerrilla
organization if a freed Mandela diverged in any way from current
ANC policy.
   There is no firm indication that such a split would occur. But
Mandela is on record as opposing guerrilla attacks on civilian
targets, while some of the younger generation of ANC officials have
advocated such attacks as a way of demoralizing whites.
   Mandela, in his few publicly reported statements while in
prison, has never distanced himself from the ANC or apologized for
masterminding an anti-government sabotage campaign _ the crime for
which he received a life sentence.
   ``If white leaders do not act in good faith toward us, if they
will not meet with us to discuss political equality ... then there
really is no alternative other than violence,'' he told Samuel
Dash, an American law professor, in 1985.
   Dash, one of the few foreigners to meet Mandela in prison, wrote
of the encounter: ``Throughout our meeting, I felt that I was in
the presence not of a guerrilla fighter or radical ideologue, but
of a head of state.''
   Doctors say the prognosis for Mandela's complete recovery from
tuberculosis is good, and government officials have suggested that
he might be moved to a private clinic while he recuperates.
   Under this scenario, he would be allowed to see an increased
flow of visitors, and the government would decide after several
months whether to free him or return him to prison.
   Such a plan is depicted as a means of gradually demystifying
Mandela, who is a living legend to many blacks.
   His name is scrawled on countless township walls and chanted at
anti-apartheid gatherings, even though few South Africans have seen
a photograph of him and only a handful have heard his voice. It is
illegal to quote or publish photos of prisoners inside South Africa.
   Abroad, he has become probably the most famous prisoner in the
world, the recipient of numerous awards and honorary degrees, the
focus of repeated campaigns and appeals seeking his release.
   Many prominent black moderates, including those who condemn the
ANC's use of violence, refuse to negotiate with the government
unless Mandela is freed. Some describe Mandela as the only leader
capable of preventing factional conflict among blacks if they did
gain power.
   If he died in prison, said Dr. Nthatho Motlana, a veteran
activist and former ANC member, many blacks would reach ``an easy
and reasonable conclusion that the system had killed Mandela.''
   South Africa's largest-selling newspaper, the Sunday Times, last
week exhorted Botha to ``seize this moment'' and free Mandela
before he became ``a giant martyr figure who will haunt our
politics into perpetuity.
   ``What a tragedy it would be if this chance to combine
compassion with sound political judgment were missed _ and
subsequent generations could point to this moment as the one when
their leaders failed them,'' the Times' editorial said. ``Mr. Botha
may not be granted such a chance again.''

<HEAD>Officials Ban Museum Exhibit On Origin Of Man Because Of Nude
Photo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials banned a large $50,000 museum exhibit
on the origin of man because it includes a photograph of a nude man
and woman embracing, Chinese newspapers reported Saturday.
   The Beijing exhibit, which was to have opened at the Natural
Sciences Museum Aug. 9, took five years to prepare and involved
more than 50 Chinese and foreign academic organizations, China
Youth News and Guangming Daily said.
   Museum officials refused to make any changes, and the exhibit
remains closed while the controversy continues, the papers said.
   Ji Yanshou, director of the Beijing Research Institute for
Science and Technology, ordered the closing.
   ``If this exhibit were about fish or flowers, I wouldn't
investigate it,'' China Youth News quoted him as saying. ``But with
this kind of exhibit, you have to consider the societal impact. At
the very least, it shouldn't have any negative influence on young
people.''
   He said the ``bare-bottomed things'' in the photograph ``aren't
much, but they will arouse kids' curiosity.''
   The photograph, provided by the French national natural sciences
musuem, is in an exhibit about how human life is formed. Zhou
Guoxing, vice director of the museum, said it was designed to break
down the mystery that surrounds the human body.
   ``This is an absolutely essential link in the origin of an
individual's life,'' the paper said.
   Survey forms filled out by about 100 people who critiqued the
exhibit before it was to open showed that only five people opposed
using the picture, China Youth News reported.
   One said a Chinese man and woman should be used, and three
others felt it was unsuitable for children, the paper said.

<HEAD>Bombs Explode In Northern Ireland Cities After Extradition Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four bombs exploded early today
outside Belfast City Hall, in a nearby shopping complex and in
Londonderry following the extradition of a convicted guerrilla
leader from the Republic of Ireland to this British province,
police said.
   There were no reports of casualties in Belfast, but one
policeman suffered minor injuries in Londonderry when a bomb
exploded in a car left on a bridge, police said. Officials said the
injured policemen was trying to evacuate the area after authorities
had received a telephoned warning.
   No group claimed responsibility for the bombs, which went off
hours after guerrilla chieftain Robert Russell was extradited to
Northern Ireland to resume a 20-year prison sentence for the
attempted murder of a police officer.
   Earlier in the night, hundreds of IRA supporters clashed with
police outside Dublin's Mountjoy prison as security forces prepared
to transport Russell 50 miles to the border, police said.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army is fighting to end British
rule in Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite the
province with the Irish Republic, which is predominantly Roman
Catholic.
   Russell, 30, is charged in connection with his escape from
prison in 1983. A last legal bid to stop his extradition failed in
the High Court in Dublin on Friday.
   In a series of complicated manuevers, police said they drove to
a secretly arranged spot near the border where Russell was handed
over to Northern Ireland police, put in a helicopter and flown 30
miles to Lisburn near Belfast.
   About 400 demonstrators massed near the border began attacking
police with fists, stones and bottles. Chief Superintendent John
Nolan of the Garda Siochana, or Irish Republic police, said three
of his men were hurt in the fighting.
   Russell escaped from Northern Ireland's Maze Prison in a mass
breakout by IRA inmates in September 1983. He fled to the Republic
of Ireland, was arrested in Dublin in 1984 and began a complicated
series of legal maneuvers in a bid to avoid being extradited back
to Northern Ireland.
   He had argued that the attempted murder for which he was
convicted in Northern Ireland was a political act and that
therefore he was a political fugitive and could not be convicted.
   But the Republic of Ireland last year agreed a new extradition
treaty with Britain under which this defense is no longer valid.
   The IRA has killed 27 British military personnel this year and
has launched a summer campaign of bombings and assassinations in
Northern Ireland, mainland Britain and Europe. It announced
Wednesday a new strategy for bombing ``commercial and
administrative property'' at minimal risk to civilians.

<HEAD>Navy Investigators Say Cost Too High To Repair Damaged Sub</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navy investigators have recommended
scrapping the fire-damaged submarine USS Bonefish because it would
cost more than $100 million to repair, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
   Three sailors were killed and 23 injured in April when the
diesel-powered vessel caught fire off the Florida coast.
   A report to Adm. Frank B. Kelso, commander of the Norfolk-based
Atlantic Fleet, suggests scrapping the 30-year-old sub but does not
suggest how to do it.
   ``There is no easy way to put the Bonefish back into commission.
It was very badly damaged,'' a Navy officer familiar with the
investigation and the report told The Virginian-Pilot and The
Ledger-Star.
   Navy officials said it would be inappropriate to comment on the
report, which has not been made public, until all reviews have been
completed.
   After Kelso completes his review, the report will be forwarded
to the Navy's judge advocate general and the chief of naval
operations.
   The investigators said the fire was caused by a wet battery
cable that short-circuited, and not by a buildup of hydrogen gas as
originally thought, the newspaper reported in Saturday's editions.
   The Bonefish was one of the Navy's four diesel-electric attack
subs, all built in the 1950s and all to be decommissioned by the
end of this decade.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis today joined tens of thousands
commemorating the march on Washington by 25 years ago by Martin
Luther King Jr. and paid tribute to the slain civil rights leader
who ``even in death ... has the power to look down upon us and see
into our souls.''
   The Democratic presidential nominee flew to the nation's capital
this morning to participate in the march from the Washington
monument to the Lincoln Memorial.
   In a speech he was to deliver there this afternoon, Dukakis
likened King to Lincoln and promised if elected president to work
to fulfill the ``dream'' King spoke of at the end of the 1963 march.
   ``What is it about a man that eve though most of us did not know
him, we felt as if we did,'' Dukakis said in the text of his
speech, released in advance.
   ``And although he did not knowmost of us, we feel that even in
death he has the power to look down upon us and see into our souls.
   ``Like the man whose memorial we gather at today, Martin Luther
King was such a man,'' Dukakis said. ``And as Abraham Lincoln, in
his time, defined our nation's purpose at Gettysburg; so Dr. King,
in his time, defined America's soul.''
   Dukakis said blacks and other minorities have made great strides
in the quarter century since the march but, quoting John F.
Kennedy, said further work lies ahead. ``This is the side of the
hill, not the top,'' Dukakis said in quoting the late president.
   Dukakis paid tribute to former rival Jesse Jackson, also at the
march, as someone ``Dr. King must be very proud of;'' and applauded
Republican challenger George Bush for his support of
antidiscrimination laws to protect AIDS victims.
   But he rattled off a list of issues on which he implied the
Reagan administration has failed to help minorities and said the
war on racism would not be won ``until we have a president who
understands and respects the Constitution of the United States.''
   From Washington, Dukakis was headed to western Massachusetts to
spend the weekend with his wife at her father's cottage.
   The Massachusetts governor spent all day Friday catching up on
state business and attended a fund-raiser for state Sen. Royal
Bolling Sr. before heading home for the evening. Bolling, the
state's only black senator, is a longtime friend of the governor's
and served with him in the House in the 1960s.
   It was during a short walk from the Statehouse to the historic
African Meeting House, the site of the Bolling event, that Dukakis
spoke about King and his march on Washington.
   ``It was one of the great historic events in the history of this
country and it came at a time when black people and minority
citizens were facing terrible discrimination,'' Dukakis said. ``It
was an historic event which triggered a civil rights revolution in
this country.''
   There was an awkward moment at the fund-raiser as Dukakis was
introduced by the senator's son, Boston City Councilor Bruce
Bolling, who was co-chairman of Jackson's Massachusetts campaign
and recently criticized Dukakis for not bringing more Jackson
followers into his campaign.
   Bruce Bolling discussed his support of Jackson but then praised
Dukakis' record as a legislator and governor on issues of concern
to minorities and for his plans to attend the march.
   ``That sign alone means so much substantively and symbolically
of where we need to go in this country,'' the younger Bolling said.
``Michael Dukakis will be there. George Bush will not.''
   Aides to Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, said the
vice president cannot attend because of a scheduling conflict.
   Dukakis did not mention Bush at the fund-raiser but had kind
words for his rival earlier in the day when asked about the vice
president's statement that deployment of the costly ``Star Wars''
space defense program should be contingent on further research.
   ``I think that makes sense,'' Dukakis said of Bush's stance.
``I'm glad to see that the vice president now agrees with me and a
great number of American citizens.''
   It was a rare Friday at the Statehouse for Dukakis, who for
months has left the state by midweek to campaign. In recent weeks,
he has spent two or three days in Boston but will cut the time he
spends at home in half after Labor Day, spokesman Dayton Duncan
said.
   ``He'll be campaigning increasingly in the fall, around five
days a week,'' Duncan said. ``It will mean a day less at the
Statehouse.''

<HEAD>US Diplomats Lead Uneasy Life In Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American diplomats in Panama are facing a
variety of real and potential problems brought on by the Reagan
administration's decision to have no dealings with that country's
military-dominated government, U.S. officials say.
   In addition, harassment of American servicemen is on the
increase, prompting U.S. military officials to take precautionary
measures. Panamanian officials respond that troublemakers among
U.S. military personnel pose daily headaches for Panamanian
authorities.
   The State Department's constraints on U.S. envoys are such that
they are prohibited from carrying out even simple tasks, such as
renewing their license plates or their driver's licenses.
   As a result, many diplomats have been forced to rent cars rather
than run the risk of driving with expired plates. Some make their
rounds with expired driver's licenses, worried what local
authorities might do if they catch them in a traffic violation or
an accident, the officials said.
   The diplomats lack the documents entitling them to diplomatic
immunity. Thus, they are subject to imprisonment if found guilty of
a legal infraction.
   According to U.S. officials, there is concern that agents of
Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega might stage an
``accident'' in which an American diplomat might be subject to
prosecution.
   The diplomats have been in this unusual position since last
February, when the Reagan administration refused to recognize the
de facto government that took office after the ouster of President
Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   Delvalle was deposed after his abortive attempt to fire Noriega,
commander of Panama's Defense Forces. Noriega has been indicted on
drug smuggling charges by two Florida grand juries.
   By withholding recognition from the Noriega-led government which
assumed power after Delvalle's ouster, the administration hoped to
force its ouster and to lay the groundwork for the restoration of
democratic rule.
   There were confident predictions in Washington six months ago
that Noriega soon would be forced to surrender power but, with key
elements of the Defense Forces supporting him, he has been able to
maintain his position despite widespread popular opposition.
   Meanwhile, U.S. diplomats and others in Panama have been forced
to make difficult adjustments.
   There have been increased incidents of harassment of American
servicemen but U.S. officials do not believe the actions represent
deliberate harassment by the Panamanian government.
   Earlier this week, Panama's Defense Forces issued a statement
denying a published report that American servicemen are being
singled out for harassment.
   The statement said U.S. troops cause daily problems for
Panamanian authorities, including fights, mistreatment of women,
venereal disease, shooting in public places and refusing to pay bar
and restaurant tabs.
   According to U.S. officials, the most serious incident involved
the Panamanian wife of an American serviceman. The officials said
she was raped by two Panamanians who were wearing Defense Force
uniforms. There also have been reports of beatings and abductions
of U.S. military personnel.
   Cynthia Farrell, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy, said
American residents of Panama, including businessmen and embassy
personnel, have reported no increase in harassment.
   But an official at the U.S. Southern Command in Panama, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said 240 cases of harassment of
U.S. servicemen had been reported between February and August of
this year.
   In response, the Pentagon has been sending some servicemen back
to the United States or moving them to safer locations in Panama.
   The Southern Command official said an increasing number of
Panamanian policemen have been attempting to bribe U.S. servicemen
stopped for traffic violations. But he noted that the police have
not been getting paid regularly because the government has been
short of cash since the start of the year.
   In another example of harassment, the Defense Forces recently
refused to allow U.S. military personnel to pick up mail at
Panama's international airport for three days, the official said.

<HEAD>Bush Camp Never Considered Guard, Parkinson Controversies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What worried George Bush and his top aides
most as he and Dan Quayle prepared for their first news conference
was how to deal with questions about their differences on issues.
The Indiana senator's National Guard service and his brief
encounter with Paula Parkinson were secondary concerns at best.
   When Bush aides asked Quayle why he joined the Indiana National
Guard in 1969, he replied that he wanted to go to law school. Had
he been drafted _ he already had passed his pre-induction physical
_ his law school plans would have been delayed three years.
   Never mentioned was the suggestion that he might have joined the
National Guard during that period to avoid service in Vietnam.
   Neither was Quayle asked if his prominent family had helped him
get into the Guard. He didn't volunteer the information that a call
was made on his behalf.
   The briefing session took place in a suite on the 40th floor of
the New Orleans Marriott Hotel. It was the second day of the
Republican National Convention and Bush had just made public the
biggest news of the week _ his choice of a running mate.
   ``A dynamic young leader for the future,'' was how Bush
introduced his choice at a rally on a Mississippi River levee.
   Within 24 hours of its disclosure, that decision generated a
flood of unfavorable publicity that threatened to undermine the
benefits expected from a carefully scripted convention. Damage
control became the top priority in the Bush campaign.
   After nearly two weeks, Bush remains in danger of having his
message overshadowed by the persistent questions about his running
mate.
   How much influence did Quayle's family exert to get him into the
National Guard? Did he require similar help to get into law school?
Did his relationship with Parkinson ever go beyond the most casual
encounter during a golf weekend in Florida?
   How Bush came to choose one of the most obscure people on his
list of potential vice presidents and how his staff dealt with the
controversy remains a well-kept secret.
   But interviews with people who had varying degrees of
familiarity with the process produced some details of the process.
All of the people interviewed insisted on anonymity.
   Bush held off his search for a running mate until after the
Democratic ticket of Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen was set in
mid-July.
   The idea was that Bush would have the advantage of countering
whatever vice presidential strategy Dukakis pursued.
   The list of those under consideration was long: two opponents
for the presidential nomination, Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of
Kansas and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York; one close friend, Sen. Alan
Simpson of Wyoming; two other senators, Pete Domenici of New Mexico
and Quayle; two women, former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth
Dole and and Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas; Govs. George
Deukmejian of California, Jim Thompson of Illinois, Carroll
Campbell of South Carolina, and John Sununu of New Hampshire, and
former Gov. Richard Thornburgh of Pennsylvania.
   Bush sought advice from a wide range of people but never gave a
hint of whether he was leaning toward one or another individual.
For the most part he listened and took notes on yellow pads.
   As the time for the Republican convention grew near, Bush held
two meetings in his office in the Old Executive Office Building
with top advisers to discuss the contenders.
   The participants included Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III,
slated to become campaign chairman; pollster Robert Teeter;
campaign manager Lee Atwater; staff chief Craig Fuller; media
adviser Roger Ailes; and friend and adviser Nicholas Brady, who
would succeed Baker at Treasury.
   The first meeting was held Aug. 8, the second one week later.
   By the end of the second meeting, the list of prospects had been
pared to no more than eight names. Still on it were both Doles,
Simpson, Domenici, Quayle, Kemp, and Thornburgh. There also were
rumors of an unnamed ``wild card.''
   Atwater and Teeter were strong advocates of a generational
approach, the choice of a so-called ``baby-boomer.'' That
description is given to Americans born between 1946 and 1964,
people coming to political maturity in this election. They are
voters who grew up in the age of television, whose views of
government were shaped by Vietnam and Watergate, and whose lives
were touched by rapidly changing attitudes toward drugs and sex.
   Both Quayle, 41, and Kemp, 50, were felt to represent a positive
generational contrast to the 67-year-old Bentsen.
   That argument appealed to Bush and as he looked at the two men,
he was far more comfortable with Quayle than with Kemp.
   Bush kept his decision a secret until he landed at Belle Chasse
Naval Air Station outside New Orleans on the morning of the second
day of the GOP convention.
   He had a brief symbolic meeting with President Reagan on the
runway and whispered to him that he had decided on Quayle.
   A moment later he gave top aides the news and began to call the
other people on the list.
   Methodically, Bush went down his list, saving Quayle for last.
The Indiana senator appeared with Bush at a riverside rally, where
an enthusiastic Bush called his running mate ``a dynamic young
leader for the future.''
   Conservatives were ecstatic. Quayle was one of their own, a hawk
who voted the conservative line on social and economic issues.
   In fact, it was Quayle's conservative views that Bush aides
assumed would be the subject of most questions at the introductory
Wednesday morning news conference.
   The Indiana senator is a stronger advocate of the earliest
possible deployment of the Star Wars missile defense system than
either Bush or Reagan and also was far more skeptical of the recent
arms control treaty between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.
   He also differed with the administration on some labor issues,
including legislation to ban use of lie detectors to screen job
applicants. The administration supported the ban; Quayle opposed it.
   As for Paula Parkinson, the insurance industry lobbyist and
Playboy model, Quayle and the campaign advisers dismissed her as an
old story. Parkinson made headlines in 1981 when it was disclosed
she had shared a room in a Florida condominium with Rep. Tom Evans,
R-Del. Quayle and Rep. Tom Railsback, R-Ill., also stayed at the
condominium but denied any involvement with Parkinson.
   The National Guard service was viewed as no different than what
millions of other Americans had done at the time.
   Twelve hours later they learned how wrong they were.
   It was the National Guard story and Parkinson that made
headlines.
   Baker and other top Bush aides met until 3 a.m., Thursday.
Despite reports to the contrary, sources insist there never was any
discussion of dropping Quayle from the ticket.
   Baker ordered a reinvestigation of the senator's background to
include interviews with family members.
   A lid was put on Quayle on Thursday to prevent any comments he
might make from dominating coverage of the night Bush would deliver
his acceptance speech.
   But when the ticket hit the road on Friday, it was quickly clear
that the No. 2 spot on the ticket still was the No. 1 story.

<HEAD>Dukakis' Army Stint in Korea Unremarkable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The northern part of South Korea was a cold,
boring place to be in the fall and winter of 1955-56 and, true to
form, Michael Dukakis, decided to spend the time bettering himself.
   Then a young Army private, he tried to learn to speak Korean.
   ``Time was really heavy on our hands,'' recalled Jay Levine, an
Army colleage. ``There just wasn't a lot to do. It really was
pretty dull.''
   Dukakis, like millions of other men, received a standard college
deferment when the Korean conflict was at its height in the early
1950s. When he graduated in June 1955, he had already been accepted
at Harvard Law School, as had Levine, his friend from Swarthmore.
   ``I could have gotten an additional student deferment if I had
gone to law school ... but I was anxious to do my service,''
Dukakis said last week.
   The Democratic presidential nominee recalled that shortly before
he graduated, ``I went to my draft board and asked them to draft me
just as soon as they could after I graduated from college, and they
did.''
   Frank Sieverts, Dukakis' college roommate, recalled that ``when
we graduated from Swarthmore, he was already in the process of
volunteering for the draft. I don't know that he was particularly
looking forward to going into the Army, but it was something he
knew he had to do and he decided to make the best of it.''
   Dukakis and Levine, now a Manhattan lawyer, joined the Army
together in the summer of 1955. After eight weeks of basic training
at Fort Dix, N.J., the two were shipped off to the Korean
peninsula, where the bloody war of 1950-53 had settled down to a
nervous armistice.
   Dukakis was in Korea 16 months _ the bulk of his two-year Army
career _ and much of that time was spent at the United Nations base
camp near the demilitarized zone.
   Dukakis was in a specialized Army unit providing support of the
U.N. commission which oversaw the ceasefire. Most of his time was
spent as a clerk, typing and filing at the unit's headquarters in a
barren, muddy outpost.
   Dukakis voiced the same complaint to Sieverts, who by then was
at Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar. ``We exchanged letters
and he described it there as cold and rainy. It was hard duty,''
said Sieverts.
   Publicly, Dukakis is proud of his military record. ``It was
after the truce had been signed but at a time when Korea was very
much on a wartime footing. I'm very proud of that service,'' he
said recently.
   Levine recalled that ``it was pretty unpleasant. For example,
there wasn't much water. It was restricted because of the fear of
infections, so that meant you got water in cans and you didn't get
many showers.''
   ``The countryside was desolate, both as a consequence of the war
and because if there were any trees or shrubs, they were ripped up
and used to burn to warm up,'' he said.
   ``The duty wasn't demanding,'' Levine recalled. ``A lot of us
counted the days until we got out. You had a lot of time on your
hands and Michael, characteristically, decided to try to learn
Korean. He spent a lot of time on that.''
   The hitch in Korea also offered the chance to travel. ``For
young men who had grown up in the northeastern United States, where
we had, it was an opportunity to see some places you wouldn't
normally go,'' he said. For example, Dukakis went to Japan on one
occasion, he said.
   Time passed slowly but Dukakis fulfilled his duties, finishing
his service with the rank of specialist third class.

<HEAD>Bush Went From Prep School to Navy's Youngest Pilot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In the spring of 1942, with the United States
bracing for a long, bloody war, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson
visited Phillips Andover Academy and delivered a message to its
blue-blood students.
   Stimson, himself an alumnus of the Massachusetts prep school,
told the graduating seniors they shouldn't rush into uniform. The
war would be long, he said, and they should continue their
education and then fight.
   But one of the graduates wasn't persuaded. George Herbert Walker
Bush had already made up his mind _ he wanted to fly and he was
going into the Navy.
   The Republican presidential candidate began his military career
on June 12, 1942, when he enlisted on his 18th birthday.
   After 10 months of flight training, Bush became the Navy's
youngest pilot and was sent to the Pacific, where the Navy was
waging a huge war with aircraft carriers to roll back the Japanese.
   Based on the carrier San Jacinto, Bush and his two crew members
flew a TBM Avenger, a slow, single-engine bomber. They took part in
missions at Wake Island, Palau, Guam, and Saipan.
   On one occasion, the crew had to ditch when the plane _ carrying
four 500-pound bombs _ began leaking oil shortly after taking off.
Bush put the plane down tail first and the three men scrambled into
a life raft and paddled away as the bombs detonated.
   His closest call came Sept. 2, 1944, when Bush was ordered to
bomb a Japanese radio station on Chichi Jima, one of the Bonin
Islands in the western Pacific. Bush took off shortly after dawn
with his crew members, radioman Jack Delaney and turret gunner
William G. White, a family friend.
   ``The flak was the heaviest I'd ever flown into,'' Bush wrote
later in his autobiography. ``The Japanese were ready and waiting;
their anti-aircraft guns were set up to nail us as we pushed into
our dives.''
   As Bush began his dive, the plane was hit by gunfire. ``Smoke
poured into the cockpit and I could see flames rippling across the
crease of the wing, edging toward the fuel tanks.''
   Bush kept the plane on target, dropped his bombs, and turned
back to the ocean. With the plane about to explode, he said he told
Delaney and White to bail out and then jumped himself.
   Bush probably pulled the rip cord too soon, he admits. His head,
and then his parachute, smashed into the plane's tail. When he hit
the water, the only thing he saw was a life raft that was part of
his shoulder harness. There was no sign of the plane, Delaney, or
White.
   Blood running down his face, his arms aching from jellyfish
bites, Bush paddled with his hands away from the Japanese-held
island, he recounted later. The Japanese sent gunboats after him,
but another Avenger chased them off.
   Finally, his prayers were answered, Bush said. A submarine
surfaced and it turned out to be American _ the U.S.S. Finback.
Bush was rescued.
   Bush spent a month on the sub, accompanying it on the rest of
its mission. When he got back to land, he was given the
Distinguished Flying Cross.
   By the time he returned to the San Jacinto, Bush was in time to
take part in the landing on the Philippines.
   On Aug, 6, 1945, Bush and his bride of six months, Barbara, were
at Ocean Naval Air Station, Va., preparing for the invasion of
Japan, when word came that the atomic bomb had been dropped on
Hiroshima.
   The war was over for George Bush and millions of other
Americans. As Bush recounted later, ``We were still young, life lay
ahead of us, and the world was at peace. It was the best of times.''

<HEAD>Consumer Groups Hail New Limits On Check Holds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Starting this week, a new federal law will put
limits on the number of days that banks and other financial
instutions can place holds on checks which customers deposit in
their accounts.
   The law has been hailed by consumer groups, who charged that
Americans were losing millions of dollars annually because banks
were freezing funds for undue amounts of time.
   Banks, however, complain that the new guidelines are confusing,
proving costly to implement and will subject them to greater risks
of fraud.
   The controversy is being stirred up by the Expedited Funds
Availability Act, which goes into effect Sept. 1.
   Under the law, banks, savings and loans and credit unions must
give customers access to deposited funds within one, three or seven
days, depending on the type of check.
   While many banks have been operating voluntarily under such
deadlines, consumer groups argued that a law was needed because too
many banks were freezing funds for periods as long as two weeks
even though 99 percent of the time they were getting credit for the
money within two days.
   The U.S. Public Interest Research Group, which led the lobbying
effort for the new law, charged that banks were making $290 million
annually in interest on the money they were withholding from
customers during the so-called ``float period.''
   Additionally, the consumer research group said that banks were
collecting another $145 million a year in bounced-check fees
because funds were not released faster for depositors' use.
   In broad terms, the new law requires that all local checks must
be cleared by the bank within three business days. A local check is
one written on an institution in the same metropolitan area or
within the same Federal Reserve check processing region. There are
48 such regions in the country.
   Non-local checks must be cleared within seven business days.
   Funds deposited in the form of cashiers' checks, certified
checks and government checks must be available to depositors the
next business day.
   By Sept. 1, 1990, the maximum hold period will drop to two days
for local checks and five days for non-local checks.
   Many bankers grumble that the new law will open the door to con
artists. They complain that they will not have enough time to make
sure deposited checks don't bounce or were not forged, especially
in the case of the one-day deadline for government and cashiers'
checks.
   The regulations implementing the new law have proven to be
complex, requiring a 600-page guide from the Federal Reserve,
dealing not only with the deadlines but such matters as how checks
should be endorsed and what information banks must supply to
depositors.
   By Oct. 31, all banks are required to have placed notices
explaining the new rules in customers' monthly statements.
   One area of confusion concerns new guidelines for check
endorsements. They state that only the first 1.5 inches on the back
of the check should be used by depositors to endorse their checks.
   This is proving to be a major headache for many retail stores
who routinely stamp the backs of checks with a lengthy list of
identification items store clerks must obtain from customers.
   As a consequence, many stores are rushing to buy new rubber
stamps or reprogram cash registers to print within the smaller
endorsement area.
   Fed officials say the new requirements are needed to help speed
the check-clearing process so that bounced checks can be quickly
returned to the institution where they were cashed. The goal is to
get the check back before the institution releases the funds.
   While the Fed says there are no civil penalties for faiing to
comply with the endorsement procedures, some banks are warning
depositors that they may be held liable for lost money if an
improper endorsement delays the quick return of a bounced check.
   The Fed is planning to spend $30 million over three years in new
equipment and procedures to speed check processing and officials
estimate that banks will spend 2.3 million work hours each year to
comply with the new regulations.
   How much of these costs will be translated into higher customer
fees is not known, but consumer advocates say that a 1986 survey
found that 20 percent of banks were already meeting the new
guidelines, suggesting that they could do so without increased fees.
   Leslie Gainer, a lobbyist for U.S. Public Interest Research
Group, said even though the regulations may increase some banking
costs, the trade-offs are worth it.
   ``Shorter hold periods for checks are especially important to
people on tight budgets or fixed incomes,'' she said. ``It will be
a relief because they won't have checks bounce while their funds
are tied up.''

<HEAD>Says Officials Agreed To Wait Till 1989 To Charge Marcos And Allow
Return</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARO CORTES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil and military authorities agreed
secretly two months ago to wait until at least next year before
filing charges against Ferdinand Marcos and allowing the ousted
president to return, a former official said Saturday.
   Ramon Diaz, who resigned this month as chairman of the
Presidential Commission on Good Government, told The Associated
Press that he reached the agreement on the timetable with military
Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa before President Corazon Aquino
visited Switzerland last June.
   Diaz said he sought de Villa's advice on the possibility of
Marcos returning after the government gave up hope that the U.S.
government would allow a Filipino court to try the deposed
president on American soil.
   He said de Villa asked for ``a little more time to make sure of
the stability of the situation.'' Diaz qouted de Villa as saying
the first three months of 1989 would be ``a fairly reasonable
time'' to prepare for Marcos coming home.
   ``We will have to consult with the (military) because,
naturally, they will be the ones who will bear the brunt if any
problems arise,'' Diaz added.
   As chairman of the good government commission, Diaz was the
principal official responsible for tracking down the estimated $10
billion that Filipino authorities say Marcos embezzled during his
20-year administration.
   Much of the money was believed to have been stashed in secret
Swiss bank accounts. Swiss authorities have refused to lift banking
secrecy laws until the government files criminal charges against
Marcos.
   But Philippine law bans trials in absentia, and the government
has delayed criminal proceedings for fear Marcos would insist on
attending the trial.
   Last year, Filipino authorities privately asked American
officials about the possibility of trying Marcos in Hawaii, where
he has lived since the February 1986 uprising that toppled his
administration and swept Mrs. Aquino into the presidency.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
told the Filipinos they disapproved of the plan for various
constitutional and procedural reasons.
   Last Wednesday, Marcos filed a petition with the anti-corruption
court asking permission to return home when a former Cabinet
minister gives a deposition on alleged kickbacks by Japanese firms
during the previous administration.
   But Mrs. Aquino ordered Solicitor-General Francisco Chavez to
ask the court to reject Marcos' petition. Chavez said he would
appeal to the Supreme Court if the lower tribunal rules in favor of
Marcos.
   The anti-corruption court has ruled that Marcos would be within
his rights to ask to be present when former public works minister
Baltazar Aquino gives his deposition in November.
   The court stopped short of ordering Marcos to return for the
deposition hearing. Former minister Aquino is no relation to the
president.
   Diaz said Chavez violated the agreement with the military on the
timetable for charges by asking the court to schedule the
deposition hearing in November.
   In Hawaii, Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad withheld comment on
the government's plans to block the former president's return
because ``we are confused by all the reports'' on the proceedings.
   ``Mrs. Aquino has said that the country is very stable and she's
not worried about any Marcos return,'' Trinidad told Manila radio
station DZXL in a telephone interview from Honolulu.

<TEXT>
   Physicists wanting to ``understand what's in
the mind of God'' are frustrated by glitches in a new $115 million
atom smasher that may someday yield secrets about the makeup of
matter and the birth of the universe.
   ``It's like you've been on a long trek to a mountaintop and
thought you were going to reach it, but discover you're only on a
ridge with another valley to cross,'' said physicist Michael
Riordan, spokesman for the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, 30
miles southeast of San Francisco.
   Construction was completed May 1987 on the taxpayer-funded
collider, a 3-mile-long underground machine shaped like a tennis
racket. That summer, it was expected to start its major task:
mass-producing what are known as Z particles.
   But numerous technical problems have prevented proper operation
of the device, so ``it's unlikely we'll make a Z particle before
the end of the year,'' narrowing the U.S. lead in a race against
European physicists to make new discoveries, Riordan said.
   ``People are frustrated,'' center director Burton Richter said
last week. ``There are thousands of components to this machine
which all have to work at a high level of reliability to get
everything to work properly. It's going to take months to get this
thing in decent shape. I hope people don't get depressed waiting.''
   But Richter, who won the 1976 Nobel Prize in physics, declared:
``We'll make this thing work. I have no doubt about it.''
   Z particles are so unstable they existed naturally only for an
instant after the ``big bang,'' the explosion scientists believe
formed the universe up to 20 billion years ago.
   By using the collider to manufacture Z particles and analyze how
they decay into other particles, scientists can study the makeup of
matter and the fundamental forces that governed the development of
the universe.
   ``What we're really after is trying to understand what's in the
mind of God,'' Richter said. ``Something started all of this
(universe). We call it the big bang, and we really don't understand
what went on back then. We want to find out what are the most
fundamental things and most fundamental forces in the physical
universe.''
   Scientists hope collider experiments will bring them closer to
developing and testing theories to explain why matter exists and
how it developed from the big bang.
   The collider is a daring attempt by American scientists to beat
European physicists in making new discoveries.
   Using unproven technology and old components, it cost only
one-tenth as much as the conventional ring-shaped $1 billion Large
Electron-Positron collider, which is due to mass-produce Z
particles late next year at CERN, the European Laboratory for
Particle Physics near Geneva.
   ``We're concerned the more than one-year lead we thought we had
over CERN is narrowing,'' Riordan said.
   Stanford's collider is designed to produce Z particles by
smashing together beams of subatomic particles called electrons and
positrons. The beams will concentrate enough energy to power 30
homes on a point about one-tenth the width of a human hair.
   Richter said Stanford already proved its approach works _ and
can serve as a model for future atom smashers _ because ``we can
produce small beams, we can get them colliding so they don't wander
around too much, and we can produce the (beam) intensities we
wanted to produce.''
   But, he added, ``The problem is we can't keep the whole thing
going long enough.''
   So Richter, who labeled the machine a ``miserable beast,'' and
three colleagues assumed direct responsibility for further
operation of the collider on Aug. 1. Since then, 100 people have
worked around the clock on fix-it efforts, Riordan said.
   He said as many as 20 flaws remain, but ``there's no one major
problem that defies solution.''
   Riordan said problems remain with transformers that provide
power to magnets that direct the beams, and with old switches that
sometimes stick as they regulate the flow of cooling water to the
magnets.
   One problem, which Riordan called overstated, was hot
weather-induced malfunctions in computer microprocessors that
control the beams.
   ``I'm a physicist myself and know what it means to have an
experiment not work,'' said Dave Nelson, executive director of
energy research at the U.S. Department of Energy, which provided
the $115 million. ``You're eating your fingernails and struggling
to make it work. It's just not fun.''

<HEAD>Two-Thirds Say National Guard Story Overblown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of Americans believe news coverage
of the troubles of Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle
has been unfair, according to a poll released Saturday by Times
Mirror corporation.
   The survey conducted by the Gallup Organization said 55 percent
of people questioned said they thought coverage of the Indiana
senator was unfair. Thirty-nine percent called the coverage fair.
   In addition, 69 percent of the respondents said the story had
received too much coverage, while only 2 percent said it had been
given too little.
   The survey of 1,000 likely voters was conducted Wednesday and
Thursday and had a margin of error of 3 percent.
   The poll was part of the Los Angeles based media company's
series, ``The People, The Press & Politics,'' which has tried to
measure public attitudes toward the news media.
   While people surveyed were critical of coverage of the Quayle
story, they also gave him far lower ratings than his Democratic
counterpart, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, when asked if they were
qualified to serve as president.
   When asked, ``Based on what you know about the Republican vice
presidential nominee Dan Quayle, do you think he is qualified to
serve as president?'' 41 percent said yes, and 40 percent said he
was not.
   When the same question was asked about Bentsen, 62 percent said
yes and 16 percent said no.
   On Quayle's National Guard service, only 15 percent said they
had a less favorable opinion of him because he served in the Guard
during the Vietnam War, while 82 percent said that did not lower
their opinion of him.
   While people said they thought the news media had overplayed the
story and been unfair, 56 percent also answered in the affirmative
when asked if they thought ``it is important that voters learn
about the details of Dan Quayle's past in order to judge whether he
would be a good vice president.'' A total of 38 percent said they
did not think information about his past was relevant to
determining his ability to serve as vice president.
   The survey also showed a steady decline in Bush's unfavorable
ratings.
   On the current poll, 30 percent of people said they had
unfavorable opinions of Bush. A Gallup survey a week earlier had
him getting a negative rating from 33 percent, while a month
earlier it was 40 percent and in May, 44 percent.
   When asked about Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis, 33 percent said they had an unfavorable opinion, virtually
the same figure as in the previous two surveys. Last May, Dukakis'
unfavorable rating was 22 percent.

<HEAD>Oceanographers Find Evidence Of Hot Water Vents In Volcanic Lake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CRATER LAKE, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bacteria discovered growing at the
bottom of a lake in what once was the throat of a volcano is the
strongest evidence yet that warm water is flowing into the lake,
two researchers say.
   That discovery by Jack Dymond and Bob Collier of Oregon State
University puts them in the middle of a controversy involving
proposed geothermal energy development near the 1,932-foot-deep
Crater Lake, which is the main part of a national park.
   The National Park Service and some environmental groups are
concerned that drilling for underground hot water or steam could
affect the lake, formed when a volcano exploded and collapsed into
itself.
   Dymond and Collier announced Friday, after three weeks of
exploring Crater Lake in a one-man submarine, that they had found
evidence that hydrothermal vents, or hot springs, do exist on the
lake floor.
   ``The main focus of that venting was around some large bacterial
mats, an exotic lifeform that we don't believe exist in other parts
of the lake,'' Dymond said at a news conference.
   He said the mats were ``clearly associated with warm waters that
are coming up through the rocks.''
   Dymond said temperatures recorded at the mats were almost 11
degrees warmer than the surrounding water.
   California Energy Co. is trying to tap the geothermal potential
of the area, still warm from past volcanic activity, but
legislation that would place Crater Lake National Park on a list of
other national parks with ``significant hydrothermal features'' is
now pending in Congress. Such a designation could halt drilling
leases outside the park.
   Determining if there is a link between the vent area and the
site of the proposed geothermal energy plant in Winema National
Forest some 4{ miles away would be an ``extremely difficult
problem'' even with the most modern scientific equipment, Dymond
said.
   But he emphasized that the bacterial mats are the best evidence
yet of vents because the mats ``are a lifeform that is not based on
photosynthesis ... but is based on the chemicals and chemical
energy that's available within the fluids that are coming up from
within the rocks.''
   Collier described the bacterial mats, first found at a depth of
about 1,500 feet, as ``big clumps of cotton plastered over the face
of a wall.''
   The potential impact of the research on geothermal development
``would be pure speculation at this time,'' said Peter Thompson,
chief ranger for the National Park Service at Crater Lake.
   Joe LaFleur, a geologist with California Energy, said Friday
that he still doesn't believe there is enough evidence to confirm
the theory that heated ground water is entering the lake, primarily
filled by rain and snowmelt.
   Regardless, LaFleur said the company's proposed geothermal plan
would not affect the lake or the park.
   The research is part of a 10-year study of Crater Lake by the
Park Service, which will end in 1992. This summer's research was
funded by a $225,000 Park Service grant.

   It was inevitable, even without his National
Guard problems, that Dan Quayle would launch a thousand jokes.
   Americans love to joke about their public figures, especially
politicians who move from unknown to nationally famous in an
instant _ as happened to Quayle, who was only the junior senator
from Indiana until George Bush picked him as his vice presidential
ticketmate.
   Quayle's name lends itself to puns. And the questions that arose
about whether Quayle had used family influence to get into the
National Guard and stay out of the draft invited jokes at his
expense.
   So it was no time at all before Americans were asking each other:
   _What do you get when you cross a hawk with a chicken?
   _A Quayle.
   Satirist Mark Russell _ even before Quayle was selected _
commented that ``Bush-Quayle'' sounded to him like the name of a
hunting magazine.
   Bob Hope said he has golf balls older than Quayle.
   Jay Leno, filling in for Johnny Carson on NBC, said he ran into
Pat Roberton and Dan Quayle ``swapping war stories.''
   Leno joshed about what Guardsmen do: ``You just kind of sit
around waiting for something to happen. If that isn't training for
the vice presidency, I don't know what is.''
   He disclosed what Quayle has that his Democratic counterpart,
Lloyd Bentsen, lacks: ``A blow drier and a pulse.''
   Then Carson came back on ``The Tonight Show'' just in time to
offer:
   ``Quayle is not going to be helped by that film that comes out
about his military career _ ``30 Seconds Over Indianapolis.''
   Russell, on public television, said the GOP ticket consists of
two combat veterans _ Bush, a Navy pilot in World War II, ``who was
shot down in the Pacific and Dan Quayle, who was bombed in New
Orleans.''
   Making the rounds in Washington were these jokey questions:
   _Why does the chicken cross the road?
   _To join the National Guard.
   And:
   _What's the difference between a turkey, a chicken and a Quayle?
   _Nothing. There is no difference.

<HEAD>Second U.S. Soldier Reportedly Helped Crack Spy Operation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The second former U.S. soldier
implicated in a growing international spy scandal provided
information that led investigators to crack the 10-year operation,
a West German newspaper said Saturday.
   West German prosecutors, meanwhile, said U.S. officials first
informed the West Germans about the spy case a little more than two
weeks ago.
   The West Germany-based ring reportedly sold the Soviets secret
information about NATO nuclear missiles, pipeline systems and troop
strength. Prosecutors are predicting a lengthy inquiry to assess
the damage to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Former U.S. Army Sgt. Clyde Lee Conrad, who allegedly led the
spy ring, remained in prison Saturday, facing espionage charges
carrying a maximum 10-year sentence.
   Conrad paid another U.S. soldier ``a five-figure sum'' for
obtaining secret NATO information, said chief West German
prosecutor Kurt Rebmann.
   The Bonn-based Die Welt newspaper said the second soldier, whose
name has not been released, provided ``the information that led to
the arrest.''
   ``Die Welt has found out that no charges have been filed against
the (second) American citizen, although he is still in the Federal
Republic (West Germany),'' the conservative newspaper added. It did
not elaborate.
   Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for Rebmann, said he could not
confirm or deny the report.
   ``The Americans first informed us about the suspicions against
Conrad on Friday, Aug. 12,'' Prechtel told The Associated Press in
a telephone interview.
   He said U.S. investigators had been trailing Conrad long before
then, but he said he did not know the source of the information
that led investigators to suspect Conrad. West German officials
arrested Conrad on Tuesday.
   Although officials here say the second American was a soldier
when he was recruited, The Washington Post quoted administration
sources in Washington as saying he has since left the service.
   Reports continued to emerge Saturday about Conrad's lavish
lifestyle.
   Conrad's neighbor, Johanna Horst, told the U.S. military's
unofficial newspaper Stars and Stripes that ``maybe there were a
few people that were jealous because they had so much money and his
son had everything.''
   Mrs. Horst said that Conrad's West German wife, Antje, ``had
lots of gold jewelry and he just gave her a new car with her
initials in gold.''
   Stars and Stripes said its calculations showed Conrad's monthly
pension was $900.
   The Bild newspaper of Hamburg said Conrad's current apartment
near the base was ``luxuriously furnished'' and that he received
about $1 million for his espionage work.
   CBS-TV quoted West German investigators Friday as saying Conrad
may have kept the money in numbered Swiss bank accounts.
   CBS said investigators found a picture of a European-wide
operation, centered in Conrad's home in West Germany, with other
agents operating out of three neutral countries. It said they
included an agent in Switzerland who handled money, two in Sweden
who acted as couriers, and a Hungarian intelligence officer in
Vienna, Austria, said to be Conrad's controller.
   Swiss prosecutors said Friday they launched an investigation
into a possible Swiss connection.
   In Molndal, Sweden, a district court on Friday arraigned two
Hungarian-born Swedish brothers as suspected members of the spy
ring.
   West German officials said Friday that Conrad was in charge of
storing and guarding classified documents in a safe at a U.S. Army
base near his home in Bad Kreuznach.
   U.S. Army officials said Conrad, of Sebring, Ohio, obtained a
top secret security clearance 1978 and still had it when he left
the service in 1985.
   But an army spokesman acknowledged Conrad was not subjected to a
follow-up background check usually given after five years.

<HEAD>Admiral Asks To Retire After Being Disciplined For Personal
Misconduct</HEAD>

   One of the Navy's highest-ranking admirals has
asked to retire after being disciplined for alleged personal
misconduct while stationed in Italy, according to the Navy and
defense sources.
   Vice Adm. Kendall E. Moranville, until Aug. 20 the commander of
the Navy's 6th Fleet, ``was taken to admiral's mast'' on Aug. 19,
said Capt. Brent Baker, a Navy spokesman.
   ``Vice Adm. Moranville was given a punitive letter of reprimand
at admiral's mast,'' Baker said. ``The action taken at the
admiral's mast is presently under review. ... Vice Adm. Moranville
has requested retirement.''
   Baker, noting that the results of the disciplinary hearing were
being reviewed by Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, chief of naval
operations, refused to discuss the nature of the alleged misconduct
beyond saying it involved ``several alleged improprieties.''
   Asked about statements by other defense sources that the
allegations included adultery, Baker would only say the allegations
``had no connection with Vice Adm. Moranville's operational
responsibilities as commander, 6th Fleet.''
   ``In fact, he continued to do an outstanding job as commander,
6th Fleet, until relieved on Aug. 20,'' Baker said. ``But in
recognition of Vice Adm. Moranville's rights in the matter, it
would be inappropriate to discuss the matter further.''
   Baker said Moranville was traveling to Washington on Friday ``on
temporary assignment pending review of his admiral's mast.'' The
spokesman declined to attempt to contact him for comment.
   The Navy's 6th Fleet is headquartered in Naples, Italy.
   The 56-year-old Moranville was replaced as the 6th Fleet
commander on Aug. 20 in a routine, long-scheduled rotation. What
was not routine, however, was that Moranville departed his old post
without the Navy announcing new orders for him.
   The Navy rarely proceeds with a change of command involving
officers at the rank of three stars without having announced the
next job of the officer who is moving on.
   In this case, the sources said Moranville, a veteran pilot who
fought in Vietnam, had been widely rumored to be on his way back to
Washington after serving two years as the head of the Navy fleet
that operates in the Mediterranean Sea.
   According to one Navy source, Moranville was thought to be
returning to the Pentagon to become the next deputy chief of naval
operations for naval warfare.
   The Navy announced last May 18 the current deputy chief for
naval warfare, Vice Adm. James R. Hogg, had been tapped to become
the next U.S. representative to the NATO Military Committee. The
service still has not announced Hogg's successor.
   Although Moranville has now requested retirement, the review of
the punishment meted out at the admiral's mast could still be
important. As is the case with any flag officer of three- or
four-star rank, it is up to the chief of naval operations and the
Navy's secretary to decide whether to recommend retirement at the
grade an officer currently holds.
   It is then up to the Senate to make the final decision.
   Moranville won the three-star rank of vice admiral on June 1,
1985.
   An admiral's mast is a closed-door, non-judicial proceeding
during which an admiral reviews the evidence and decides if any
discipline is warranted.
   In this case, Baker said Moranville had appeared at mast on Aug.
19 before Adm. James B. Busey, the commander-in-chief of U.S. Naval
Forces Europe.
   Baker said the allegations against Moranville did not ``come to
light'' until shortly before the vice admiral already had been
scheduled for routine rotation.
   Moranville, a native of Guide Rock, Neb., is a highly decorated
aviator who holds two Legion of Merit medals, the Air Medal with
Numeral ``10,'' and two Navy Commendation Medal with Combat ``V.''

   It could go in the books as a
cat-and-mouse caper.
   When Amy DeDonatis reported her cat, Marilyn, was being held for
$3,200 ransom, police began plotting the trap.
   ``We set it up like we would have any other extortion operation.
With the highest concern for the ... cat's safety,'' said police
Sgt. Bob Robkin.
   The 2-year-old white cat was snatched on Aug. 14 by a man
claiming Ms. DeDonatis owed his girlfriend $3,200, the cost to
repair the woman's Porsche after a recent accident that occurred
while Ms. DeDonatis was driving the car.
   ``He said, `Are you going to give us the money?' And I said,
`Not until I see the cat,' '' Ms. DeDonatis recalled.
   Police gave Ms. DeDonatis ``flash money'' and staked out the
site Thursday where the ransom drop had been arranged, an alley
behind the salon where she works as a hairdresser.
   Soon a man showed up, with Marilyn in tow.
   ``I was so happy I just handed him the money,'' Ms. DeDonatis
said.
   That's when police moved in. They arrested Eddie Perez-Pantoja,
30, on charges of grand theft and extortion.
   Marilyn was taken to headquarters and photographed as evidence,
then released. Once home, she had little appetite _ and just took a
catnap.
   ``She looked a little freaked out,'' her owner said.

   When 18th century naturalist
William Bartram explored Florida's St. Johns River he found
alligators so plentiful ``it would have been easy to have walked
across their heads had the animals been harmless.''
   The reptiles' numbers and menacing jaws proved no protection
against the human onslaught that pushed the Florida alligator to
dangerously low numbers and onto the federal endangered species
list by the late 1960s.
   ``There were times when the fate of the alligator didn't look
too good,'' said Allan Woodward, head of the alligator research
unit for the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.
   But now there are so many alligators, thanks to preservation and
the animals' resilience, that a month-long alligator hunting season
opens Thursday.
   ``I can say we've all been pleasantly surprised by how fast the
gator has rebounded,'' Woodward said.
   Florida's first widespread hunt in 26 years _ small-scale
experimental hunts have been held since 1981 _ sets a maximum of 15
alligators for each of 238 license recipients who were selected at
random from 5,000 applications.
   It's not just sport. Alligator hides sell for $42 a foot and
their meat brings about $5 a pound.
   Wildlife experts credit strong anti-poaching laws adopted in
1970 as instrumental in nearly doubling the alligator's population
in Florida to 1 million and removing the animal from the endangered
species list in 1977.
   The Lacey Act sought to close off lucrative markets for poachers
by making interstate transportation of alligator products a federal
offense. Poaching is now only a state offense, with a maximum
penalty of a $1,000 fine or a year in jail.
   ``We made a pretty good living off the gators before they
stopped it,'' said Norm Padgett, 66, who will guide some of the
novices in the hunt.
   Alligators' adaptability also contributed to their
proliferation, Woodward said.
   They can generally tolerate encroachment of homes and highways.
As marsh and deep-water areas diminish, alligators have learned to
thrive in man-made canals or even roadside ditches and golf course
water hazards.
   ``As long as there is food and water and a place to sun
themselves, that's what makes a gator happy,'' Woodward said.
   Despite their laconic behavior, they learn quickly to be wary of
humans, and their keen night vision and acute smell and hearing can
make them an elusive prey.
   ``They're not as dumb as some people seem to think. Their
skittishness is an asset for their survival,'' Woodward said.
   Officials say the upcoming hunt is confined to areas where
exceptionally high alligator populations could force the animals to
relocate or starve.
   In Texas, which resumed alligator hunts in 1984, about 1,400
gators were taken last year. Louisiana officials reported about
23,800 gators were killed last year in the state's 30-day season,
which has been held since 1972.
   Participants in Florida's hunt _ many of them city dwellers who
have never stalked gators _ will be armed with harpoons and ``bang
sticks,'' which fire a cartridge upon impact with a captured gator.
Guns are prohibited because the animals often sink after being shot.
   ``It's just an adventure that I never thought I'd go on,'' said
Thomas Alpern, a free-lance writer from New York City, one of only
two non-Florida residents who won licenses. ``I'll just try to have
fun and get some gators.''
   Alpern will be one of the many inexperienced gator hunters
hiring veteran trappers as guides.
   ``It's a good relationship,'' said Mike Rafferty, who
exterminates nuisance alligators for the state and plans to guide
several hunters. ``For the new hunters, it's excitement. For me,
it's business.''

   Thousands of civil rights demonstrators
chanting ``Keep Hope Alive'' rallied today for the 25th anniversary
of the Martin Luther King's March on Washington and renewed his
demands for peace, jobs and freedom.
   The crowd at the foot of the Washington Monument was far smaller
than the quarter-million marchers who jammed the National Mall to
hear King's famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech in 1963.
   The U.S. Park Police made an early estimate of 20,000
demonstrators today, but the throng was expected to grow by the
time Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis and civil rights leader
Jesse Jackson deliver their speeches in late afternoon.
   President Reagan, who spent the day campaigning for Republican
candidates in California, issued a statement saying America ``has
made vast progress toward fully achieving Dr. King's dream of a
color-blind society.''
   As a result, Reagan said, ``America today is a freer land for
Americans of all backgrounds.'' He added that ``freedom is our
unending challenge and our continuing vocation as Americans.''
   But at the rally, one speaker after another said King's dream of
equality is far from being realized.
   ``We are here looking for jobs, looking for peace and looking
for freedom,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
   ``There are some who will say that freedom is reciting the
Pledge of Allegiance, but that is not what we mean when we say
freedom,'' Rangel added. ``Freedom means our children can get an
education as easily as they can get cocaine in our schools.''
   Jackson appeared briefly and led the rally in his trademark
chant of ``Keep Hope Alive!''
   On the eve of the march, Jackson told a cheering crowd of black
activists that Dukakis, his former rival for the Democratic
nomination, and running mate Lloyd Bentsen provide ``a choice and a
chance in November ... an alternative, a chance to change.''
   Jackson, Dukakis and Coretta Scott King, widow of the slain
civil rights leader, were to address the rally today.
   An estimated 250,000 people marched in Washington on Aug. 28,
1963.The same number of people commemorated the 20th anniversary of
the march five years ago.
   During the 1963 event, the largest demonstration in history in
the nation's capital, Martin Luther King outlined his vision of a
color-blind America where all citizens had equal economic,
political and social opportunity. The march spurred Congress to
pass the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964.
   Jackson lashed out Friday at the Republican ticket of Vice
President George Bush and Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana.
   ``Bush and Quayle want to privatize the Justice Department. They
want to privatize foreign policy. They want to privatize public
education,'' said Jackson.
   ``And since they like privacy so much, I want to help them move
back into private life,'' Jackson told a lunch meeting of the A.
Philip Randolph Institute, an organization of trade unionists named
after the late black labor leader.
   Neither Bush nor Quayle had responded to an invitation to join
the commemoration, said Ofield Dukes, a spokesman for the march
organizers.
   A Bush spokesman said the GOP presidential nominee would be
campaigning in Texas today.
   The tide of rhetoric was running against the Republicans in
advance of the march.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, addressing the same lunch
audience as Jackson, said, ``It was black voters, more than any
other factor, that held the line against Reaganism four years ago
and turned the tide against it two years ago.''
   ``The decisions made by black voters will be no less crucial
this time around,'' said Kirkland, whose labor federation voted
Wednesday to endorse Dukakis and Bentsen.
   ``The plagues of Egypt lasted seven years. The Reagan
administration has been allotted one more year than that,''
Kirkland said. ``The job before us is to see that the curse is
lifted from the land on schedule, and that the incumbent and his
chosen successor get their termination notice on Election Day.
   ``That will give them 72 days to pack up and clear out, which is
generous. They themselves believe that workers deserve no notice at
all,'' said Kirkland, alluding to a new law opposed by Reagan that
requires employers to give workers 60 days' notice of large-scale
layoffs.

   Charges have been filed against the father
and stepmother of an 8-year-old boy who allegedly was regularly
beaten and confined in a cage until he sought help from a neighbor,
prosecutors say.
   Andrew Ezell Crosby, 34, and Brigettatha Brown, 31, pleaded
innocent Friday to charges of child endangering and causing great
bodily injury, said Andy Reynolds, spokesman for the district
attorney's office.
   They were arrested Aug. 4 after the boy asked a neighbor ``if he
could stay with her for the rest of her life,'' Reynolds said.
   The neighbor called police and the boy was taken to a hospital
where he was found to have been severely abused, he said.
   The parents had posted $13,000 bail each after their initial
arrest. They were taken into custody Friday when their bail was
increased to $75,000.
   The boy was placed in Los Angeles County custody and the
couple's two other children were being cared for by a grandfather,
Reynolds said.

<HEAD>The Big Problem In Greenwich Is Big Houses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA STOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lifestyles of the rich and famous in
this swank New York suburb may become a little less opulent if some
city leaders have their way: They want to pass a law limiting the
size of some houses.
   ``I never thought I'd see the day when the Planning and Zoning
Commission would say a rich man cannot build a large house in
Greenwich,'' said Willis N. Mills of SMS Architects of New Canaan.
   Greenwich, population 60,000, is home to many celebrities and
corporate leaders, including singer Diana Ross, real estate
magnates Donald Trump and Harry and Leona Helmsley, and tennis star
Ivan Lendl. It is also where Vice President George Bush grew up.
   The problem, suporters of the proposed ordinance say, is not the
big old estates but the huge homes being built on small lots _
small by Greenwich standards, that is.
   Peter Joyce, chairman of the Planning and Zoning Commission,
said the ordinance would allow homes of up to 6,500 square feet on
a two-acre lot and up to 8,700 square feet on a four-acre lot. It
also would limit expansion of existing homes.
   ``In the past five years, each new house that is being built is
bulkier than the one before it,'' said Jara Burnett, president of a
neighborhood group. ``It is distressing to the neighborhood. ...
There is a loss of sunshine and a definite loss of privacy.''
   The town had its first hearing on the proposed ordinance last
week and 150 people showed. The heated discussion went late into
the night. Another hearing is set for Sept. 13.
   ``There is a mystique and an ambiance to Greenwich that you can
build the big house,'' said G. Thomas Dadakis, a commercial
real-estate developer. ``I don't think the commission has looked at
the economic impact of this, which will happen in 20 years.''
   Dadakis also said the commission shouldn't have selected August
for the hearing because ``everybody is up in Nantucket or the
Vineyard at this time of year.''
   First Selectman John Margenot said he opposes the ordinance
because ``it's a little like the last man over the bridge syndrome:
`I got my house so let's do it now.'''
   The reason houses are getting so big is economic, he said.
   ``The land is too expensive and people want to get their money
out of it by building large homes,'' Margenot said Friday. ``How
could a builder charge you $1.5 million for a three-bedroom
colonial? So, they're building a super house with a pool and
everything.''
   Real estate agents say that even without a house, four acres can
cost $1 million.
   ``I think it's a good idea as long as it's not so restrictive
that people in homes can't make some additions and it doesn't
influence the architecture,'' said Bett McCarthy, executive
director of the Greenwich Board of Realtors.
   McCarthy said people in Greenwich ``have lost their sense of
proportion in the size of a lot to a house.''

<HEAD>Major Shortages Of Spare Parts Plaguing Bomber Fleet, GAO Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major shortages of reliable spare parts are
plaguing efforts to sustain operations of the B-1 bomber fleet,
causing the Air Force to cannibalize grounded planes to continue
flight training, the General Accounting Office said Saturday.
   ``The Air Force, even with its extraordinary efforts, has not
been able to meet training and readiness objectives,'' the GAO
said. ``Reliability shortfalls _ parts failing faster than expected
_ continue to be a major cause of spare parts shortages.''
   The Air Force took exception to the report, saying that while
``challenges do remain,'' the service is ``making steady progress
in assuring adequate spare parts are available for the B-1B.''
   ``The most important point is that the B-1B is performing its
deterrent mission right now,'' said Capt. Jay DeFrank, an Air Force
spokesman. ``Today B-1B aircraft have trained crews and fly the
necessary sorties to meet wartime requirements.
   ``The Air Force has steadily improved the planned rate of B-1B
training flights and expects that trend to continue as the system
matures and spare parts are delivered,'' he said.
   The new GAO report comes just days after the Congressional
Budget Office released estimates that making significant
improvements in the B-1 program could cost up to $3.4 billion.
   The budget office said those improvements, once made, would
allow the bomber to fly to targets inside the Soviet Union, its
original mission.
   The reports mark the latest rounds in a long-running fight
between the Air Force, which has defended the plane, and
congressional critics who contend it may cost too much in trouble
and money to improve it.
   ``It's very difficult to get a straight story out of the
Pentagon about the plane's problems,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, who released the
latest report on the aircraft from the GAO.
   He noted that the Air Force disputed a GAO finding that the
Strategic Air Command reduced the number of mission-ready crews
available for the B-1 fleet because parts difficulties reduced the
number of planes available for training.
   ``The Defense Department said the reason wasn't spare parts but
the extensive modification of the B-1, Aspin said and added: ``In
fact, the GAO had training reports that cited spare parts shortages
as the primary cause of the training limitation.''
   ``Once again, the facts seem to contradict Pentagon assertions
about the B-1,'' Aspin said.
   Shortages of B-1 bombers ready to fly affect not only training
but plans for placing bombers on alert to respond to a nuclear
attack on the United States.
   ``Alert status is the bomber's reason for being,'' Aspin said.
``If that's adversely affected _ and it is here _ then you've got
problems.''
   The GA0 report said some problems have improved since its last
examination of the B-1 bomber program last year.
   ``The Air Force's and contractor's attention to priority parts
has resolved some parts problems, but a more systematic approach
would ensure early and appropriate attention to the problem
parts,'' the report said.
   Two weeks ago, Aspin said it might be necessary to halt spending
on the bomber rather than pay for expensive repairs.
   The earlier Congressional Budget Office report on the bomber
said problems center around electronic countermeasures, the
complex, computer-driven system that defends the plane against
attack as it flies on its mission.
   The B-1 program was killed by President Carter in 1977, but
resurrected by President Reagan four years later because Reagan
said the plane was needed as a successor to the aging B-52.
   The Air Force has bought 100 B-1s and will use the plane in
conjunction with the so-called ``stealth'' B-2 bomber as the B-52
replacement in the nation's arsenal of strategic weapons. The B-2,
nicknamed for its capability to evade enemy air defenses, will have
its first public flight in November.
   The last B-1 was delivered on April 30. The Air Force said the
total cost of the program was $27.3 billion, but that figure
doesn't include any improvements.

   Utilities, coal producers and other businesses
have poured $6.5 million into a lobbying organization whose goal is
to stifle congressional legislation that would reduce acid rain, a
public interest group said Saturday.
   Citizens for Sensible Control of Acid Rain has received its
contributions exclusively from industry ever since its founding in
1983, according to figures compiled by the U.S. Public Interest
Research Group. The lobbyists have spent $5.1 million so far,
including $500,000 from April to June of this year, the group said.
   ``Few people realize that their power company may be bankrolling
an effort to block clean air legislation while contributing
enormously to our air pollution problems,'' said Alexandra Allen, a
staff attorney for the group.
   The figures, obtained from the clerk of the House, indicate that
most of the money _ $4.3 million _ has gone to Communications
Management Inc. of Arlington, Va., for legislative consulting and
public relations.
   The biggest contributor has been Southern Company Services Inc.
of Atlanta, which has donated $2.3 million to the organization. The
lobbyists reported receipts from 114 companies, the report said.

   Beneath 40-year-old murals depicting the end of
wars and plagues, the envoys of warring Iran and Iraq entered the
grand chamber separately and skeptically to sit at opposite tables
for peace talks.
   They faced each other across a gulf of gray carpeting 15 feet
wide and a another gulf of centuries-old hatred. They called each
other ``monsieur,'' ``excellency,'' and ``colleague,'' but after
two days of direct and separate talks under U.N. auspices both
sides remained far apart.
   Ater eight years of the war and more than a thousand years of
Arab-Persian enmity, no one expected the long peace process to be
without pitfalls or its first step in Geneva to be easy.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar recessed the talks
Saturday for a ``day of reflection'' after both sides set out their
divergent positions on numerous, contentious issues, from the
Shatt-Al-Arab waterway dispute to the repatriation of more than
80,000 prisoners of war.
   The talks are to resume Sunday.
   ``We are working, I must admit, at a rather slow pace ... in an
atmosphere of mistrust,'' Perez de Cuellar told reporters Saturday.
``So far, the talks have been highly polite and they have listened
to each other with patience and, I hope, understanding.''
   But while the week-old gulf cease-fire continued, Iraq was
continuing poison gas attacks against its own rebellious Kurdish
minority, killing 200 and injuring 1,000 in the last few days,
Kurdish guerrilla leaders told the Associated Press in Nicosia.
   The Security Council in New York, meanwhile, denounced the
repeated use of chemical warfare against Iran. U.N. experts have
said Iraq has ignored U.N. appeals against using the morally
repugnant weapons banned under international law.
   On Friday night, after the talks were suspended, the U.N. chief
said: ``It is too early to ask for flexibility. I hope that after
reflection, perhaps flexibility will start later.''
   Their two days of peace talks, which began Thursday, were the
first face-to-face discussions between the envoys since the gulf
war began eight years ago in September 1980.
   The talks are aimed at consolidating a fragile week-old gulf
cease-fire and moving toward a comprehensive peace settlement. The
secretary-general said the talks could drag on for years, if
problems persist, or could lead to a settlement in a few months if
both parties show the political will.
   The Iraqi side has not commented, but Iranian President Ali
Khamenei on Saturday accused Iraq of procrastination and ``trying
to degrade the role of the secretary-general and the U.N. peace
resolution.''
   ``If Iraq continues its way,'' he said, ``talks may go on for
years and may never come to a conclusion.'' His comments to
journalists were reported on Tehran Radio and monitored in Nicosia.
   After two days of talks both in the same room and in separate
chambers, inevitable problems became evident, especially over the
Shatt-Al-Arab waterway. It is the disputed border between Iran and
Iraq and the only outlet to the sea for landlocked Iraq.
   Western and Middle Eastern diplomats said Iraq, which had scored
a series of impressive military victories, was taking a hard and
uncompromising position in the talks and seeking to make the
waterway dispute a high priority on the agenda.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iran,
badly battered in the war, was taking a more cooperative position,
but it, too, was unyielding on key issues.
   Iran says the waterway and other issues are not on the agenda.
Iraq says that the waterway and other problems must be discussed at
this time.
   The diplomats also said the Iraqi side, which demanded
face-to-face talks, appeared to be annoyed and to feel it was being
rushed and pressured into accepting a timetable before its
suspicions about Iranian intentions were allayed.
   On July 18, after resisting the U.N. peace resolution 598 for
one year, the war-weary Tehran government abruptly announced it
would accept a U.N.-monitored cease-fire and pushed for an
immediate end to hostilities.
   Then it was Iraq, which had formally embraced the resolution for
a year, that held back and demanded face-to-face talks before a
cease-fire. Iraq said it feared Iran merely was seeking a temporary
truce to rebuild its forces before continuing the war. It said
early talks were necessary to test Iran's good intentions.
   Iran refused. Both sides compromised on talks shortly after the
cease-fire, which began Aug. 20.
   On Friday, Velayati broke his silence on the talks and said Iran
insists that the 1975 Algiers Treaty, which gives Tehran rights to
the eastern half of the the Shatt-Al-Arab, is valid. He said
observing the treaty, unilaterally repudiated by Iraq before it
invaded in 1980, is a fundamental condition for peace.
   The secretary-general has said that points have been clarified
in the current discussions and that both sides appear sincere in
their desire for peace.
   ``But this is a problem that has lasted many centuries,'' he
said, ``and it is not in one afternoon that we can decide it.''
   Iran's culture is Persian, and Iraq's is Arab. Although Iran
shares the Moslem religion with the Arabs, it adheres to the
minority Shiite sect that has been at odds with the predominant
Sunni branch of Islam for 1,300 years.

<HEAD>DC Ordered To Pay $1.3 Million In Fines Due To Prison Overcrowding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has ordered the
District of Columbia to pay $1.3 million in fines because of its
failure to alleviate crowded conditions at the city-run Lorton
Reformatory in Fairfax County, Va.
   ``The district has for years been aware of recurrent
overcrowding in its prison, and has not taken steps adequate to
eradicate the problem,'' the court stated in its decision Friday.
The judges also faulted the city for failing to build a ``sorely
needed new prison facility'' or to find other solutions.
   The fines were originally imposed by a U.S. District Court judge
last year, and have been increasing at a rate of about $5,000 per
day since then. The city immediately challenged the fines and
refused to pay anything until its appeal was ruled upon.
   On Friday, the appeals panel decided the city was out of time.
   ``It is our hope that, confronted by the prospect of heavy
fines, the district will at last face up to its responsibilities,''
Judge Spottswood W. Robinson III wrote for the court.
   He added that ``the limits of judicial tolerance have been
reached.''
   City officials were not expected to appeal the ruling. D.C.
Corrections Director Hallem Williams Jr. said through a spokesman
he was ``disappointed in the court's ruling.''
   ``It's going to be very expensive'' for the city to continue
exceeding the population ceiling at Lorton, said Alan Pemberton, an
attorney for the inmates at the Central Facility at Lorton.
   The city has been given a population limit of 1,125 inmates at
Lorton's medium-security Central Facility, which is currently
housing about 400 extra prisoners.

<HEAD>Brands Bush With ``Outrageous Misrepresentation'' On Drugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen on Saturday charged Vice President George Bush with
``an outrageous misrepresentation of the facts'' for accusing
Michael Dukakis of failing to fight drug use.
   Bentsen, wrapping up a five-day campaign swing with a stop in
his native Texas, visited the local sheriffs department and then
met with reporters to counter the Republican accusations.
   ``George Bush comes to Texas, goes to Longview, and charges Mike
Dukakis with being soft on the war on drugs,'' said Bentsen. ``That
is an outrageous misrepresentation of the facts.''
   In Massachusetts, Bentsen said, the homicide rate is half the
national average, Dukakis has added 1,500 law enforcement
personnel, and pushed programs to help victims of crime.
   ``I don't think (Dukakis' record) has been surpassed by any
other state in the nation,'' he said.
   Bentsen, who added the Texas stop to his schedule to counter
Bush's campaigning in the state that both call home, said the vice
president himself has failed to stop drugs despite being appointed
head of a drug interdiction task force by President Reagan.
   ``This administration has rhetoric that isn't balanced by the
realities,'' Bentsen said, citing attempts by the White House to
cut back what Congress planned to spend on drugs, particularly $225
million in aid that was earmarked for local law enforcement.
   ``They've been talking tough and cutting back the money at the
same time,'' he said.
   Asked about the death penalty, Bentsen said he supports it but
Dukakis continues to oppose it. And he conceded that he and Dukakis
have differences over gun control also _ although he said Dukakis
does believe in the ultimate right of people to own guns to protect
their homes or hunt.
   ``I think what you have to look (at) ... is beyond some of the
symbols,'' of tough law enforcement, and look at the results, he
said.
   Much of Bentsen's campaign trip was spent in the Midwest and
South, trying to sell Democrats who voted for Reagan on the
Massachusetts governor and his positions on national defense,
trade, health care, and law enforcement.
   Bentsen told reporters on his campaign plane that he felt he was
making progress in convincing people Dukakis is their man.
   ``I still think we have to work at making it understood on the
defense issues,'' he said. ``But I think we'll get our message
across.''
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., who met with Bentsen in Hot Springs
where the senator received a raucus, enthusiastic welcome on
Friday, said the Texas senator was an important element in the
party's efforts to win back Reagan Democrats.
   ``Bentsen allows the middle class, white, middle age,
independent businessman to feel comfortable with the Democratic
ticket,'' he said. ``He gives a lot of them a reason to come back.''
   Bentsen said he gauged his success at the large number of local
elected officials who wanted to appear with him when he travels in
the South. ``There's not room enough on the dais,'' he said.

<HEAD>Reagan Salutes 25th Anniversary Of March On Washington</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a statement by President Reagan on
the anniversary of the March on Washington, issued by the White
House Saturday:
   ``Twenty-five years ago about a quarter of a million Americans
gathered in Washington to bear witness to a noble cause. In their
speeches, in their songs, in their prayers, those marchers recalled
America's promise of liberty and opportunity and said it was time
to make that promise an unblemished reality.
   No one was more eloquent on that day than Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. Speaking from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, he said that
he had a dream of freedom, justice, and hope for every American and
of a day when all Americans would `not be judged by the color of
their skin but by the content of their character.'
   Since that day a quarter of a century ago, America has made vast
progress toward fully achieving Dr. King's dream of a color-blind
society. As a result, America today is a freer land for Americans
of all backgrounds. And this nation, which Lincoln called `the last
best hope of earth,' is an even more brilliant beacon of freedom
and hope for peoples throughout the world.
   On this anniversary, it is fitting that all Americans should
give thanks for that progress and for the work of those who
sacrificed so much to bring it about. And let us remember, as well,
that freedom is our unending challenge and our continuing vocation
as Americans. This was what the march on Washington was about. This
is what we as a nation are about.''

   The mayor handed out a harsh etiquette
lesson to city workers after he read a newspaper column describing
a telephone caller's rude treatment.
   ``I was livid. I was very frustrated,'' Mayor Joseph R. Paolino
Jr. said Friday. ``That's just the kind of action I've been trying
to ferret out of City Hall.''
   Paolino delivered a tongue-lashing in person to the Department
of Inspection and Standards Thursday after reading the columnist's
account of her attempt to get a zoning question answered.
   The mayor also transferred one employee suspected of rudeness to
a job where he will not have to field incoming calls.
   The columnist, Gayle Gertler of The Providence Journal, wrote
that two city divisions referred her back and forth and one worker
responded to her questions by saying, ``You're not listening,
dear.''

<HEAD>Vandals Delay Utah Opening Of ``Last Temptation Of Christ''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Late-night vandals briefly delayed the
Utah premier of the ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' by unrolling
the film from its reel and slashing the movie screen, authorities
say.
   Police Detective Lt. Mel Shields said the theater canceled only
its 1 p.m. showing Friday of the movie that has drawn the wrath of
some religious groups, because of its depiction of Christ. It
obtained another copy of the film and fixed the screen in time for
the 4 p.m. show.
   Lt. Steve Diamond said the film was originally thought to have
been stolen, but it was found later in the basement.
   ``They (vandals) took it there and dumped it in a big pile, as
it were,'' he said. ``It was dumped off the spool. We now have it
in our evidence room.''
   When the theater finally opened, police officers inside searched
handbags for sharp objects or projectiles.
   One police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the vandals probably remained in the building after Thursday
night's shows. He said a rear exit appeared to have been opened
from the inside.
   Inside, police found 5-foot-long slashes on the screen.
   Shields said police had no suspects.
   Earlier, police had issued a demonstration permit to a Utah
religious group opposed to the movie, which has been condemned by
the Mormon Church, predominant in the state.

<TEXT>
   Guards shot to death 36 prisoners and
wounded 103 others who tried to escape from a Rangoon jail in an
escalation of the unrest in Burma, state-run Radio Rangoon said
today.
   More than 500 prisoners also escaped today from a jail in the
southern city of Mergui, 350 miles south of the capital, the radio
said.
   As the law and order situation in Burma deteriorated, a popular
former defense minister and an ailing leader of the communist
movement joined widespread calls for an interim government to end
the country's authoritarian, one-party rule.
   Radio Rangoon said prisoners burned buildings and tried to scale
the walls at Insein Jail, eight miles north of downtown Rangoon, in
their escape bid Friday.
   By today, all the jail buildings had burned to the ground, the
radio reported without saying if the rioting had ended.
   ``So prison personnel had to control the situation and
unavoidably had to shoot,'' the broadcast said. ``As a result, 36
prisoners were killed and 103 injured.''
   Earlier, Radio Rangoon said seven inmates were killed and at
least 1,000 escaped during uprisings at three prisons across the
country. Strikes closed factories, government offices and
transportation.
   Sources said student activists on Friday circulated photographs
of six men they said were caught in acts of arson, bombings and
shootings. The students said the six were identified by their
military units and confessed to being military intelligence
officers who were ordered to create disorder.
   Retired Gen. Tin Oo told a rally of about 50,000 people in
downtown Rangoon that a transitional government must be formed
immediately to end the turmoil that has toppled two leaders,
sparked almost daily demonstrations nationwide and killed at least
112 people.
   ``Following the recent public demonstrations against the
one-party regime, the light of democracy has now been visible,''
Tin Oo said. ``But the final goal has yet to be achieved.''
   ``I therefore urge the government to immediately form an interim
government to ease the situation and allow the interim government
to prepare for democratic reforms,'' he said.
   Tin Oo said the military must play an important role in
re-establishing democracy.
   Tin Oo, 62, widely respected by both the military and the
public, was removed as defense minister and army chief of staff in
1976 by strongman Ne Win. At that time, he was considered the
third-ranking member of the ruling hierarchy and had a strong
following in the military. He was later jailed after an
investigation into an alleged plot against the government.
   He said today he was not interested in political office.
   ``When a multiparty system is eventually introduced, I for one
will not stand for any election. I won't be in politics. I have now
come in simply because the situation has developed into a serious
national matter,'' Tin Oo said.
   Many retired top military officers attended Tin Oo's rally,
along with Buddhist monks and students.
   One of Burma's former communist leaders, Thakin Soe, issued a
statement from his bed in Rangoon General Hospital calling for a
return to multiparty government.
   The statement supported the mass demonstrations for democracy
and demanded the government form an interim government and restore
peace.
   Thakin Soe, 82, formed the pro-Chinese faction of the Communist
Party in 1937. He spent most of his life underground, but was
captured after army suppression campaigns in the late 1960s and
granted amnesty in 1980. His party no longer exists and he is not
active in the movement.
   The situation in Burma has deteriorated since President Maung
Maung lifted martial law Wednesday and security personnel virtually
disappeared from Rangoon's streets.
   On Friday, Radio Rangoon said guards at Insein Jail fired on
2,000 rioting inmates ``and some inmates and prison warders were
injured.'' Sources said there could have been many people killed,
but the situation remained confused and they did not believe even
the government had precise casualty figures.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said the rebellion at Insein Jail
occurred Friday morning and that about 1,000 inmates were killed.
The BBC broadcast, monitored in London, said:
   ``Anti-government demonstrations are reported to have begun .. .
(at Insein Jail) early in the day when prisoners had left their
cells for breakfast. Several who tried to give speeches are said to
have been shot dead and in the chaos that followed, fires were
started.
   ``As inmates fled to escape the flames, it is reported that
security guards opened fire. According to reliable sources, about
1,000 people were killed.''
   The report could not be independently verified.
   Pro-democracy strikes halted all rail service and Union Burma
Airways domestic flights; closed oil refineries in Syriam across
the Rangoon River and in Mann in central Burma; crippled most
factories of the Industries Ministry; and left foreign ships
waiting at Rangoon port, officials said.
   Most government offices in Rangoon were empty. People were
hoarding goods and the price of rice was soaring.
   The current turmoil in Burma began when Ne Win, who led the 1962
coup that ended democracy and instituted rigid socialist rule,
resigned and the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party named
hardliner Sein Lwin to succeed him.
   Demonstrations began almost immediately against Sein Lwin,
widely hated for ruthlessly crushing dissent. They turned bloody
Aug. 8 when security forces fired on protesters. Sein Lwin resigned
Aug. 12.
   On Aug. 19, Maung Maung became Burma's first civilian president
in 26 years.

   President Reagan, renewing his plea for aid
to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, cautioned today that world peace
cannot be achieved unless Americans ``stand firm, stand tall and
stand for freedom.''
   Reagan used his weekly radio address to celebrate advances
toward international peace in several of the world's hotspots,
which he credited to the efforts of his administration and his
policy of ``peace through strength.''
   He also put in a plug for renewed aid to the Contras, which is
stalled in Congress.
   Reagan cited the cease-fire in the Persian Gulf, the Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan, work toward an agreement for Cuban and
South African withdrawals from Angola, as well as the improvement
in relations with the Soviet Union.
   ``Peace is gaining ground. But the gains haven't just come in
the last few months. It's taken seven and a half years of effort,''
Reagan said. ``We came into office convinced that the word peace is
just an empty slogan, unless the word strength follows hard upon
it.''
   The president said the United States has supported ``noble and
brave'' freedom fighters, such as the Afghan rebels, and stood firm
to the military threat of the Soviet Union.
   ``Once the Soviets learned they could not intimidate us or
cajole us into giving them the advantage, they came to the
bargaining table,'' Reagan said. ``They did business because we
proved we meant business.''
   Reagan complained that it has been almost two years since
Congress has approved any military aid to the rebels battling the
leftist Sandinista government.
   ``Here's the results _ the Sandinistas come to the bargaining
table making promises to bring democracy and end the war. And then
they violate those promises with impunity. They feel free to do all
this because they do not believe that we mean business,'' Reagan
said.
   The president warned that ``there is still time to turn the tide
in Nicaragua. ... The future for world peace is bright if we
Americans continue to stand firm, stand tall, and stand for
freedom.''
   Reagan's radio address was taped prior to his departure today
for a round of fund raising for the California Republican Party.
   In the Democrats' response, Sen. John Glenn criticized the
president for vetoing the $299.5 billion Pentagon budget bill
earlier this month, accusing him of making rejecting the measure in
an effort to help the prospects of Republican presidential
candidate George Bush.
   ``I am appalled that he chose the well-being of his political
party above the well-being of the country,'' said Glenn, D-Ohio.
   Following a week in Los Angeles, Reagan and his wife Nancy were
then returning to their 688-acre ranch north of Santa Barbara.
   The Reagans are scheduled to attend two fund-raising events _
one for the California GOP and the second for Reagan's congressman,
Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif.
   Earlier this week, Reagan appeared Wednesday at a rally for Vice
President George Bush.
   The Republican party expects to use Reagan as much as possible
in California, since the state's 47 electoral votes are considered
crucial for Bush's effort for taking the White House in November. A
total of 270 electoral votes are needed to win.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan's first event
today, in Thousand Oaks, Calif., was arranged for 350-400 people
who either contributed or gathered $5,000 per person for the state
party's campaign coffers.
   Some 1,000 people, contributing $200 apiece, were to attend the
second even, held for Lagomarsino near Santa Barbara, Fitzwater
said.
   On Tuesday, Reagan spoke at a fund-raising luncheon for Sen.
Pete Wilson, R-Calif., that brought in $500,000, Fitzwater said.
   While in Los Angeles, the 77-year-old chief executive underwent
his annual checkups with his allergist and ear, nose and throat
specialist.
   His longtime otolaryngologist, Dr. John House, determined Friday
that the president continues to suffer from ``mild hearing loss''
in his left ear and ``moderate hearing loss'' in his right ear.
   ``There has been no change in the president's hearing deficit in
the past 10 years,'' said a statement issued by White House
physician Dr. Larry Mohr after House conducted his examination.
   The statement said the hearing aids Reagan wears in both ears
also were checked ``and are working perfectly.''
   Fitzwater noted that Reagan started to use a new type of hearing
aid last year and he has had no complaints. Reagan is able to
adjust the volume by using a credit-card sized control.
   Reagan also got a clean bill of health from his allergist, who
determined there's been ``no essential change'' in Reagan's
sensitivity to pollen, Fitzwater said Friday.
   Reagan, who receives weekly shots to control the allergy, was
examined Thursday by his longtime allergist Dr. Ralph Bookman, and
the checkup ``was routine,'' the spokesman said.
   The examinations were conducted in the privacy of the
president's penthouse suite at the plush Century Plaza Hotel.
   Outside of appearing at the fund-raising events, the president
only left his Los Angeles hotel suite for private dinners with old
friends in the evenings.
   The president and his wife have no public events scheduled next
week and are to remain at their secluded mountaintop spread in the
Santa Ynez Mountains until after Labor Day.

   The certified world's champion
credit-card collector _ he never leaves home without a bunch of
them _ says he wants to get even more of the handy little plastics.
   Walter Cavanagh, ``Mr. Fantastic Plastic'' as he calls himself,
says he is determined to get one of each of the 10,000 credit cards
he estimates are available in this country. He figures it will take
him five years to reach his goal.
   ``I figure I only have 12 percent of what's out there,'' he said
in an interview last week. ``My goal is to get them all.''
   Cavanagh, whose 1,099 credit cars earned him a paragraph in the
Guinness Book of World Records, said he applies for 100 cards a
month, and gets few refusals.
   `I did get a letter from a gas company back East asking why I
wanted a card since I lived 3,000 miles from one of their
stations,'' Cavanagh said.
   He doesn't owe on any of the cards because he pays his bills in
full.
   He has found the only drawback to collecting plastics is the
barrage of catalogs and other buy-me goodies he gets daily.
   ``My mailman hates me,'' he said.

   Elke Duechler has climbed 22 mountains
higher than 14,000 feet during the past three years, all of which
was good training for Saturday when she climbed Longs Peak to wed
James Mitchell.
   The couple and 18 friends began the climb up the
14,156-foot-high mountain in Rocky Mountain National Park at 3 a.m.
in order to reach the summit by noon for the ceremony.
   ``Jim is in love with that mountain,'' said Duechler, 45, a
bookkeeper from Salida. ``As long as we've known each other, Jim
has said that if we got married, it would be on top of Longs Peak.''
   ``I've been to the top of Longs Peak five times on three
different routes,'' said Mitchell, 60. ``We're going up the north
face, which is not considered technical but is still extremely
difficult.
   ``It's really a favorite place for the whole family and
extremely beautiful.''
   Duechler said the setting was ideal for the wedding.
   ``The nicest thing is that only the people who really want to be
there will be there, and nobody else,'' she said.

upholding the state's ``grass tax'' on illegal drugs will encourage
other states to enact similar laws as a way to cash in on the sale
of contraband, officials said.
   ``I've had calls from every state in the union,'' said Dorothy
McClung, director of appeals and legal services for the state
Revenue Department. ``Many were going to wait until the Minnesota
Supreme Court ruled. There may be further action now.''
   At least 12 other states have already patterned laws after
Minnesota's, officials said. Most recently, Utah and Illinois
imposed drug taxes this year.
   The law, upheld by the state Supreme Court Friday, allows
revenue officials to put liens on and seize the property of dealers
who don't buy revenue stamps and stick them on their packets of
drugs.
   Under the 1986 law, the state has been busy filing tax liens
against drug dealers and seizing cars, boats, jewelry and computers
from those who forget to buy their red, blue and green tax stamps.
   So far, the state has collected $430,000 but has more than $16
million in outstanding assessments. The law triggered 90 challenges
in state tax court.
   ``We've been upheld. People who have been challenging it are
going to be paying up,'' said Chris Sanft, a collection officer
with the Department of Revenue.
   The law is similar to those requiring cigarette and alcohol
manufacturers to display stamps on products they sell. Violations
can result in felony charges. Dealers arrested with drug packages
that are not stamped can be assessed the tax plus a 100 percent
penalty, regardless of whether they are convicted on drug charges.
   The law is the brainchild of Robert Ebel, director of the
state's Tax Study Commission. He wanted to use tax policy to make
life miserable for drug pushers.
   ``I got sick and tired of the pushers,'' he said. The grass tax
``seemed like a perfect tool.''
   ``People thought it was very funny,'' he said. ``Nobody
understood the concept of taxing narcotics.''
   Under the law, drug stamps can be purchased through the mail or
at the revenue department offices in St. Paul. The state has sold
only 254 stamps, bringing in $2,018. The stamps cost $3.50 for each
gram of marijuana, with a required minimum purchase of $150 worth
of stamps. The rate for a controlled substance, including cocaine,
is $200 per gram, with minimum purchase of $1,400 in stamps.
   Revenue officials must guarantee confidentiality to those buying
stamps. The right to purchase them anonymously is important to
ensure that dealers are allowed the constitutional guarantee
against self-incrimination, McClung said. A similar law in South
Dakota was struck down because it offered no such protection.
   ``We learned from the mistakes of others and, obviously, we did
it right,'' said State Rep. Bill Schreiber, chief sponsor of the
legislation. ``Dope peddlers were getting slaps on the hand rather
than being placed behind bars and taken off the street. With the
grass tax, we're going to hit them in the pocketbook.''
   Friday's ruling was a loss for William Sisson of Roseville, who
objected to the state's seizure of his recreational vehicle, travel
trailer and lawn tractor after he failed to pay a $113,000
assessment in taxes and penalties for possession of controlled
substances.
   The court ruled that the grass tax law does not violate due
process rights or the right against self-incrimination. It's
uncertain whether the ruling will be appealed.

<TEXT>
   Officials waited nearly a year after a 2-year-old
died from eating lead paint from her apartment walls before
obtaining a court order removing the building's remaining tenants,
a newspaper reported Saturday.
   The two-flat building has not been shuttered even though city
Health Department inspectors found lead paint there during an
inspection last Sept. 16, the day Sylvia Zamora died, the Chicago
Sun-Times reported.
   The inspectors did not refer the housing code violation to the
city's corporation counsel until February, and never told city
attorneys that the little girl had died, officials in the health
and law departments said Friday.
   The corporation counsel's office obtained an order this week to
shutter the building, the newspaper said. Assistant Corporation
Counsel Nilda Soler said she would have taken action sooner if her
office had known of the lead poisoning death.
   ``The lead poisoning presents the urgency of the situation,''
Ms. Soler said. ``If children are still residing in the building,
you want to prevent more poisonings.''
   Lead paint has a sweet taste, and Sylvia apparently ate the
toxic chips as they fell off the wall. Her parents moved out after
her death.
   Lead paint is banned in Chicago, but an estimated 300,000
buildings still contain it, according to the Sun-Times.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet official negotiating with the United
States on ways to verify two superpower treaties that limit nuclear
tests said Saturday the talks would become ``a milestone event.''
   The U.S. and Soviet delegations arrived in Geneva on Saturday
for the third round of talks, which begin Monday after a two-month
break.
   Both delegation leaders expressed hope the two sides would
conclude protocols for verifying two treaties that limit nuclear
tests to 150 kiloton explosions.
   The verification, or anti-cheating, protocols under negotiation
apply to the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976 Peaceful
Nuclear Explosions Treaty. Both treaties were signed but never have
been ratified, though both countries say they are abiding by the
accords.
   The United States has said it will not ratify the treaties until
adequate provisions are made for verifying Soviet compliance with
the pacts.
   This round of negotiations ``should become a milestone event in
the dialogue between the U.S.S.R. and the United States on this
important problem of nuclear disarmament,'' chief Soviet delegate
Igor Palenykh told reporters.
   The two countries conducted a joint verification experiment Aug.
17 in Nevada, where Soviet officials for the first time witnessed
and monitored a U.S. nuclear test, using their own equipment.
   U.S. officials are scheduled to go to Moscow next month for a
similar experiment at the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground on
Sept. 14.

   More than 20 farm group representatives
shook Willie Nelson's hand and gave the country singer a banner to
thank him for calling attention to the plight of family farmers.
   ``It would be hard for you to realize the hope you're giving
farmers,'' Ken Mattingly of the Community Farm Alliance of Kentucky
told Nelson on Friday night.
   He gave Nelson a banner reading ``Thanks for all your help,
Willie.''
   ``You never know how much you can help until you get involved,''
said Nelson, who was in town for a concert.
   Nelson organized Farm Aid, a series of concerts betinning in
1985 to raise money for family farmers facing bankruptcy and the
loss of their land. He plans a fourth Farm Aid concert in
Washington, D.C., in 1990.

   Former professional football player
J.D. Hill has been ordered to attend a drug treatment program
following his arrest for alleged cocaine possession.
   Hill, 39, who has long campaigned against drugs, was among 27
people arrested July 15 during an undercover operation in which
police posed as sellers of crack cocaine and arrested customers.
   On Friday, Sacramento Municipal Court Judge John V. Stroud
placed Hill on a yearlong drug diversion program and fined him $50.
   Hill was a wide receiver for the Buffalo Bills of the National
Football League from 1971 to 1975, playing in the all-star Pro Bowl
in 1972. He then played for the Detroit Lions before retiring in
1978.

   Academy award-winning American filmaker
Francis Ford Coppola visited the 2,400-year-old Acropolis temple
complex Saturday where he plans to set the last scene of his movie
``Life Without Zoe.''
   The partly autobiographical 40-minute film will form part of a
trilogy called ``New York Stories,'' said Coppola, 49. Directors
Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese are making the other two movies, he
said.
   ``It's a very romantic film and is the story of a little girl,
Zoe _ named after the Greek word for life _ who represents a kind
of irresistible life force in her family. Her father, a flutist, is
based on the character of my own father,'' the director said.
   Coppola said ``the precocious little girl'' is obsessed with the
Acropolis because of its historical associations.

   Actress Deborah Raffin has received eath
threats, and an actor once managed by her husband is under court
order to stay away from both of them and not harass them, their
lawyer said.
   Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Lawrence Waddington issued a
temporary restraining order Thursday requiring Steven Inwood not to
harass Miss Raffin and her manager-husband, Michael Viner, said
their attorney, Jessica Kaye. He must stay at least 250 yards away
from him, the order says.
   Inwood played a driven Broadway director in the movie ``Stayin'
Alive.'' When a call was placed Friday to his publicist, a
receptionist said, ``We not commenting on anything.''
   Ms. Kaye said Viner managed Inwood until last year.
   The 35-year-old actress, who this year starred in the NBC-TV
miniseries ``Noble House,'' received the death threats Aug. 16 and
has gone into seclusion for her safety, Ms. Kaye said. The
telephone company traced the calls to Inwood's phone, she said.

   A woman who allegedly broke into David
Letterman's house, then claimed to be his wife when she was picked
up driving his car, has been found competent to stand trial. A
prosecutor said Letterman may be called to testify.
   Margaret Ray, 36, was released on her own recognizance Friday.
She is charged with two counts of burglary and one count of car
theft.
   Dr. Sander H. Fogle, a psychiatrist who treated Ray, testified
Friday that she ``has been restored to competency'' and is capable
of assisting in her own defense.
   In May, Ray was stopped at the Lincoln Tunnel between New Jersey
and New York, driving Letterman's blue, 1988 Porsche.
   Ray didn't have the toll money and allegedly told the toll
collector, ``I'm Mrs. David Letterman and this is David Jr. Don't
you think David Letterman is good for the toll?''
   She had allegedly broken into Letterman's New Canaan home and
set up housekeeping several days before the incident. Letterman,
star of NBC's ``Late Night with David Letterman,'' was in
California at the time.
   Authorities initially decided not to press charges at
Letterman's request. But Ray returned to Letterman's house soon
after being released and was rearrested.
   Assistant State's Attorney Philip D'Eromo said the state intends
to prosecute and that Letterman may be called to testify. Letterman
has said he doesn't know the woman.

   Actor Francisco Quinn pleaded innocent to
felony assault charges for allegedly kicking and seriously injuring
his girlfriend in their West Hollywood apartment.
   The 25-year-old son of actor Anthony Quinn was charged with one
count each of corporal injury to a co-habitant and assault with
force likely to cause great bodily injury. He entered his plea
Friday.
   Quinn, who practiced karate, allegedly kicked Carolyn Greenberg,
23, in the abdomen last October during an argument in their
apartment. She suffered multiple injuries including a ruptured
spleen, authorities said. The couple since has split up,
authorities said.
   The younger Quinn appeared in the film ``Platoon.''
   Pretrial motions were set for Sept. 16. If convicted, the
younger Quinn would face up to seven years in prison. He is free on
$75,000 bail.

<HEAD>Burial Plots May Be Scarce in Future</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cost of living in Fairfield County is
among the highest in the country, but the cost of dying has become
pricey, too. To make matters worse, burial plots are running out.
   Most cemeteries, where single plots can cost $1,000 and more,
are likely to be filled within 10 or 15 years, according to funeral
home and cemetery managers.
   ``Cemeteries are going to become a thing of the past,'' said
William E. Magner Jr., who manages Willowbrook Cemetery in Westport.
   Harriet Steuber, president of a group that administers Union
Cemetery of Norwalk, said that once space runs out, ``I guess we'll
all have to be cremated and dumped in the sound,'' referring to
Long Island Sound, the stretch of ocean off the Connecticut coast.
   ``I don't like to think about it. It gives me the creeps,''
Steuber said.
   One solution may lie above ground.
   Mausoleums up to four stories high are becoming increasingly
common in the region. Construction of one such facility by the
Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport began this month at Darien's
St. John's Cemetery.
   ``It's one of the, shall we say, contemporary modes of burial to
help meet the lack of space,'' said Monsignor Nicholas B. Grieco.
   The structures are often multistory units containing hallways
lined with crypts. Each floor might contain up to 100 bodies.
   ``Think of it as a giant bookcase with slots,'' Magner said.
   But mausoleums are not cost-savers. They are generally more
expensive than below-ground burial, Grieco said. Other cemetery
managers say mausoleum interment is about twice the price of
traditional burial.
   Sometimes it's possible to economize.
   At St. John's Cemetery in Norwalk, a two-grave plot can be used
for four individuals _ one on top of another. The practice is
allowed at the discretion of the cemetery, which charges $1,050 for
the double plots.
   But the cost of the grave site is only the start. Add to that
payments to the cemetery for digging the grave and the price of a
concrete vault, plus a foundation for a gravestone and it could
cost as much as $2,000.
   Cremation, which one local funeral director said now accounts
for about 30 percent of his business, can save several hundred
dollars at the funeral home and there would be no cemetery costs.
Basic cremation and transporation services can cost as little as
$160.

   Three female Andean
condors are alive, well and eating rodents fed to them by their
hand puppet ``parents'' in preparation for their eventual release
into the wild, animal biologists said.
   The three young birds, ranging in age from 3 to 5 months, were
transported last week to a wilderness site in rural Ventura County.
They are part of an experiment to test methods that researchers
plan to use when they release a group of endangered California
condors into the wild in the 1990s.
   The Andean condors are listed as endangered, but there are
thousands of them, while there are only 28 California condors. The
California condors all are in zoos in Los Angeles and San Diego as
part of a breeding program to reintroduce the species into the wild.
   The three Andean condors are beginning to adjust to life in a
cliffside cave north of Fillmore, said Los Angeles Zoo biologist
Mike Wallace, who is in charge of the release program.
   By early December, the birds will likely begin to fly and hunt
their own food, Wallace said Friday.
   The largest bird was apparently homesick and welcomed a visit in
her enclosure from her puppet ``mother.'' Two of the three Andean
condors were raised by human hand puppets.
   ``If you can imagine a 17-pound bird just bouncing all over the
place and grunting for attention _ it was way too much for one arm
with a puppet on it to handle,'' Wallace said.
   The bird raised by real condor parents has kept her distance
from the others and ardently protects her territory, Wallace said.
But she is eating from the puppets nonetheless.
   A fourth Andean condor died, apparently of shock, en route to
the Ventura County site last week.

   On only her second day off in 50 days
of 12- to 24-hour shifts fighting western forest fires, Dorothy
Hays went dancing.
   She and hundreds of others battling this summer's record-setting
fires are having the time and challenge of their lives.
   But for some, fatigue is setting in. The duration of these giant
blazes, fueled by drought-dried timber and erratic wind, has begun
to take its toll on those cutting and digging on the front lines.
   ``We just don't have enough bodies anymore. We're spread so
thin,'' U.S. Forest Service spokesman Bob McHugh said Saturday.
   Firefighters work at least 12- to 16-hour shifts for at least 10
days straight before one day of rest and relaxation is granted.
Some find themselves working double shifts.
   Some end up in crews that employ ``coyote tactics'' _ staying at
the battle front for up to 36 hours straight until all food and
supplies are exhausted.
   ``If you get tired, fatigue can be dangerous. You forget about
safety,'' said Kirby More, who's been fighting fires since 1956.
``But we hold up. Our folks are trained for this.''
   On Saturday, More's ``hot shot'' crew was heading to the top of
a mountain ridge to clear a 40-foot-wide fire break through the
forest. The work had to be done by hand because the terrain was too
steep for bulldozers.
   ``It ain't the fun, although at times it is fun. And it sure
ain't the pay. I think I do it for the challenge, the excitement.
It's one hell of a challenge, and sometimes you get to say `Damn,
we stopped it,''' More said.
   Ms. Hays, a Forest Service employee from Oregon, said flames
twice forced her crew to retreat quickly. Her crew digs lines at
the front of the Storm Creek fire, which on Friday threatened Cooke
City, in south-central Montana just northeast of Yellowstone
National Park.
   She and the rest of her crew went to Red Lodge, about 40 miles
away, Friday night and went dancing at a tavern. Saturday they were
back on the fire.
   ``We were getting pretty tired, but the R&R was real good,'' she
said. ``It's real exciting being out there because you never know
what's going to happen next. It's a lot of fun.''
   When the crew has to pull double shifts, 24 hours straight,
``people start dropping like flies,'' said Brian Spivey.
   Forest Service officials said some crews were losing people who
had to return to school or jobs. That, coupled with new fires in
other parts of the West, caused manpower problems. About 1,200
soldiers from Fort Lewis in Washington state were being trained to
join the front lines.
   Saturday morning, some 830 firefighters were in a camp outside
this tiny town. They are paid at varying rates, starting at $6.38
an hour, since some are civilian contractors and others come from
various federal agencies, including the Forest Service and Bureau
of Land Management. Depending on their agency and pay scale, some
receive overtime and hazard pay as well.
   The Forest Service provides large, nourishing meals and lots of
beverages.
   ``They feed you a lot of liquids and a lot of food,'' said James
Begay, a Navajo firefighter from Window Rock, Ariz. ``They keep you
going.''

   A monster lobster, weighing 35 pounds and believed

Boston this weekend.
   The lobster was caught Thursday off the coast of New Bedford
when it was dragged in with a load of scallops, said Heather

bought the creature.
   At about 3 foot long, the lobster is believed to be one of the
largest and oldest ever captured off the Bay State coast.
   ``I've been in the seafood business for over a decade and this
is the largest lobster I've ever seen,'' said Larry Smith, owner of
the fish company.
   The lobster was displayed at Boston's Faneuil Hall and was moved

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission fined
Virginia Power $100,000 for safety violations at its Surry nuclear
plant, including an incident in which three workers were exposed to
radiation because a supervisor ``lost track of the time.''
   Friday's decision marked the second time this year the plant has
been fined by the federal agency and the 15th since 1972.
   ``The NRC is concerned that these violations collectively
indicate significant weaknesses in the overall radiation protection
program at the Surry power station,'' J. Nelson Grace, the agency's
regional administrator, said in a letter to the utility.
   Virginia Power said it would not contest the penalty, which is
double the usual fine.
   The fines followed two inspections. The first was conducted
during a routine refueling shutdown in May. The second was after a
maintenance worker was exposed to more radiation than allowed by
federal regulations on May 27.
   During the shutdown, inspectors said workers at the plant were
not properly equipped with monitors when entering high-radiation
areas. The utility also failed to post warning signs that
respirators were required and failed to evaluate adequately the
amount of radioactive material in the air, the NRC said.
   In the second incident, three contract maintenance workers were
exposed to unusually high radiation doses because a Virginia Power
technician ``lost track of the time'' and let them stay in a
high-radiation area for longer than they should have, Virginia
Power spokesman Carl F. Baab said. One of the workers was exposed
to levels higher than NRC standards allow.

   The Palestine Liberation Organization is
on the verge of proclaiming an independent Palestinian state that
would recognize Israel's right to exist within pre-1967 boundaries,
senior PLO officials say.
   The PLO also will set up a provisional government to run the
state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, occupied by Israel since
1967, with Yasser Arafat's old guard sharing leadership for the
first time with young militants in the territories, the officials
say.
   ``We have the people and we have the land. With the declaration
of our government, we would have fulfilled all the prerequisites
for an independent state,'' chief PLO spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif
said last week in a telephone interview from Baghdad.
   Recognition of Israel would challenge the United States' refusal
to talk to the PLO. Washington has said it would deal with the
group only when it formally accepted the existence of a Jewish
state and renounced terrorism.
   But whether PLO recognition of Israel would signal a breakthough
in Middle East peace efforts is highly questionable, at best.
Israel has said it will not accept an independent Palestinian state
on its doorstep. It refuses to negotiate with the PLO, which it
views as a terrorist group.
   The provisional government is expected to be announced when the
450-member Palestine National Council, a kind of
parliament-in-exile, meets in Algiers, Algeria.
   Palestinian leaders agreed to hold the meeting, originally set
for Sept. 20, sometime ``after September,'' said Salah Khalaf,
second-in-command to PLO chairman Yasser Arafat. He said the delay
will give the PLO leadership time to ``crystallize a clear and firm
vision and define the steps it will take.''
   The PLO, encouraged by some Arab governments, has long
considered forming a government-in-exile, an idea given fresh
impetus by the 8-month-old uprising in the occupied territories.
   PLO officials said the difference between a government-in-exile
and a provisional government is that the former would involve only
PLO leaders, while the latter ``will include known PLO figures and
leaders from inside the occupied territories.''
   The inclusion of the young Palestinian militants is an
acknowledgment by the middle-aged men who have long run the PLO
that the rebellion in the West Bank and Gaza has breathed new life
into the Palestinian struggle.
   The uprising also produced a new generation of Palestinian
figures who have long been frustrated with Arafat's failure to
achieve a homeland and who could eventually challenge his authority.
   More than 250 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed
since the uprising began Dec. 8.
   The PLO move is a direct result of Jordanian King Hussein's
abrupt decision last month to sever Amman's administrative and
legal links with the West Bank, which Jordan has run with the tacit
agreement of the Israelis.
   Hussein's action challenged Arafat and the PLO to take
responsibility for the West Bank and declare an independent
Palestinian state.
   ``We're capable of filling any legal or adminstrative vacuum
created by the Jordanian decision,'' Abu Sharif stressed.
   The PLO announced last week it would pay the salaries of 21,200
officials and teachers who were laid off by Amman.
   Asked if the PLO had secured enough international backing for a
provisional government, Abu Sharif said: ``The countries that will
recognize our government will be more than those that recognize
Israel.''
   The PLO is recognized as a liberation movement by 115 countries.
Senior PLO officials, including Arafat, have been touring Arab and
European capitals to lobby support for a provisional government.
   Salah Khalaf, a senior Arafat lieutenant and a veteran
hardliner, said this month in Vienna that the proclamation of a
Palestinian state ``will certainly come this year.''
   Asked if the state would recognize Israel, he said: ``We're
realistic. Israel is there. It exists as far as the political
reality is concerned.''
   He earlier told France's Journal Du Dimanche weekly that the
state would recognize Israel.
   The new direction in PLO thinking emerged earlier this year in a
document signed by Abu Sharif, one of Arafat's closest aides, which
advocated recognition of Israel and a ``two-state solution'' _ an
independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel.
   Arafat cannily kept his options open by not endorsing the
document publicly. But the document's emergence raised hopes that a
new political awareness was creeping into Palestinian thinking.
   A Palestine National Council committee drafted a comprehensive
political program for a provisional government during an Aug. 10-12
meeting in Baghdad and the program is now being debated by the
PLO's 15-man Executive Commitee, the decision-making body.
   Abu Sharif said the document is based on the U.N. General
Assembly's Resolution 181 of 1947, which partitioned Palestine into
Jewish and Arab states.
   Endorsement of that resolution is, in effect, recognition of the
Jewish state within pre-1967 boundaries.
   Palestinian hardliners have opposed the idea of a
government-in-exile or a provisional government, arguing that would
dilute the PLO's status as a liberation organization committed to
armed struggle.
   But one key opponent, George Habash of the Marxist Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine, declared in Algiers this month
that it was now time to form a government to run the affairs of the
5 million Palestinians inside and outside the occupied territories.

<HEAD>Force Never Before Used to Get Students in Pool, Says Torchia
Predecessor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL KACZOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former head of Navy rescue-swimmer
training testified Saturday that he never permitted use of force to
make unwilling students get into the swimming pool for drills.
   The testimony came in the court-martial of Lt. Thomas A.
Torchia, charged with dereliction of duty for allegedly permitting
instructors to push a panic-stricken recruit back into a pool at
Pensacola Naval Air Station and hold his head under water.
   The sailor, Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis.,
died in the incident March 2.
   ``I never authorized a person to be placed back in the pool,''
said Cmdr. Allan P. Nesbitt III, Torchia's predecessor. ``That is
something that would not occur and did not occur.''
   But he also said that regulations at the time did allow
instructors to pull tired students away from the walls of the pool.
   During a June investigative hearing, a pathologist testified
that Mirecki had a phobia about being pulled under water. That fear
triggered heart failure followed by drowning, although it was
uncertain which caused his death.
   One of Torchia's superiors and four instructors have received
non-judicial punishments ranging from a reprimand to reduction in
rank. Another instructor faces court-martial on charges of
involuntary manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery.
   The maximum penalty for Torchia on the dereliction of duty
charge would be a reprimand and loss of two month's pay and
seniority for promotion.
   The prosecution contends use of physical force in training is
illegal, but defense lawyer Ferdinand Salomon argued in his opening
statement that it is a necessary part of the rescue-swimmer course.
   Salomon, a retired Navy captain, told four officers sitting in
judgment of Torchia that the Navy rescuers do not ``pluck little
children out of the shallow end of the country club swimming pool.
The training had to be tough.''
   Nesbitt was the first of 25 witnesses scheduled to testify
during the trial. Questioned by Salomon, he testified that it was
not unusual for swimmers to go to the aid of downed fliers at
night, in heavy seas and high winds.
   In an effort to make the training realistic, the school
traditionally permitted instructors to pull students who were
tired, suffering from cramps or believed to be malingering away
from the wall of the pool if they grabbed it for support, Nesbitt
said.
   ``We were training as if we were in the middle of the Indian
Ocean. That was the philosophy of the school,'' Nesbitt said.
``There was nothing out there for you to grab a hold on.''
   In the wake of Mirecki's death the Navy has prohibited
instructors from touching students at all.
   Mirecki died during a since-banned exercise called ``sharks and
daisies,'' in which students would swim in a circle and instructors
would grab them at random, pulling on their heads the way a
panicked-stricken, drowning person might grab a rescuer.

   Harrison Hawkins was a 20-year-old busboy when
he joined 250,000 civil rights demonstrators in the 1963 March on
Washington where Martin Luther King articulated the dreams of black
Americans.
   Hawkins couldn't eat at the Washington restaurant where he
worked at the time. No blacks were served.
   ``I thought something had to be done about segregation,'' he
said Saturday as he joined a rally marking the 25-year anniversary
of that historic day. ``It was the first time I'd seen that many of
our people _ black people _ get together and do something
positive.''
   Hawkins, now a rigger who handles heavy objects at the
Smithsonian Institution, said he feels good about the progress
that's been made on civil rights in the past quarter-century,
although he says more remains to be done.
   ``In the workplace you see petty things, hidden things.'' he
said. ``It's not direct discrimination, but it's there.''
   Another veteran of the 1963 march who was on hand for Saturday's
anniversary event was 76-year-old Eula Johnson of Washington, who
sat quietly in a shaded lawn chair listening to the speeches.
   She said she left her six children at home and came to the 1963
march because ``I felt that Negroes were making progress and I
wanted to be a part of it. I was raising children at the time and I
wanted them to have the opportunities I thought they should have.''
   Mrs. Johnson said she returned home, picked up her youngest
daughter, 7-year-old Theresa, and took her to a rally later that
day, ``just so she could know how it felt for blacks and white to
be together.''
   Theresa recently died of a stroke at age 32, but not before she
became the only black woman to work in her division at a
telecommunications company, Mrs. Johnson said proudly.
   ``She was able to see the hope before she died,'' she said.
   Naomi and Seymour Wenner, a retired white couple from suburban
Chevy Chase, Md., said they, too, felt drawn to the 1963 march.
   ``It was a great event in my life,'' Wenner, 75, recalled
Saturday. ``Everything was focused on one thing _ civil rights for
Negroes.''
   He said that while Saturday's rally marked the progress made
over the past 25 years, ``there are too many groups taking a free
ride on this _ justice for janitors, this union, that union,
socialist workers, ERA. They're not focused. It isn't what the
memory of Martin Luther King was about.''
   Roselyn Smith-Withers, 38, who is entering Howard University's
School of Divinity, saw Saturday's rally as a celebration that
marked her acceptance of King's message after years of anger and
hurt.
   She was 13 and the only black child in her Long Island, N.Y.,
school when her mother brought her to the 1963 march to hear King
speak.
   ``He articulated the pain that I knew, the fears I had and the
exclusion I was living through,'' she recalled. ``It has been a
force in my life from that point to this day.''
   She said that while her 8-year-old son ``doesn't know the racism
I knew,'' he feels it in other ways.
   ``The major message of this rally is the ongoing fight. I don't
know that it's always accepted.''

<HEAD>State Of Emergency Ends In Chile For First Time In 15 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military government ended the state
of emergency Saturday for the first time since President Gen.
Augusto Pinochet took power in a bloody 1973 coup.
   The lifting of the legislation that severely restricted civil
liberties took effect with the publication of government decrees in
the official bulletin.
   Interior Minister Sergio Fernandez, who last Wednesday announced
the state of emergency would be rescinded, said the restrictions
were no longer needed because order had been re-established
throughout Chile.
   The government lifted the state of emergency and the state of
disruption of internal peace. Combined, they allowed the government
to suspend publication and broadcasts by news media, restrict
public gatherings and labor union activities, and censor mail and
communications.
   Pinochet was empowered to order the arrest and detention of
opponents for up to 20 days; to send into exile citizens considered
dangerous to internal security; to order internal exile for up to
three months and prevent citizens from freely traveling through
Chile.
   The move took effect three days before Chile's top military
leaders meet to nominate a single candidate for a presidential
referendum to be held in early October.
   Pinochet, who is commander of the army, will nominate a
candidate, as will the commanders of the navy, air force and
national police. The 72-year-old general is widely expected to be
nominated for re-election so that he can serve until 1997.
   The government's move, however, was viewed by some as helping to
meet opposition demands for fair play in the presidential
plebiscite.
   But dissidents, while acknowledging it will improve the
political climate, say they will wait to see whether the government
will really allow citizens to exercise the basic liberties that
they were deprived of during the state of emergency.
   Genero Arriagada, a leader of the moderate opposition Christian
Democratic Party, said Saturday, ``This does not erase the 15-year
image of Gen. Pinochet as a dictator.''
   A coalition of socialist groups promptly decided to test the
government's mood by scheduling an opposition rally in Santiago
next week. Before the emergency was lifted, the military had
refused to authorize rallies.
   Another leftist coalition that includes the outlawed Communist
Party also set a rally in Santiago for Sept. 11, the day the
government commemorates the 15th anniversary of the coup that
toppled elected President Salvador Allende. Allende, who died
during the coup, killed himself, the military junta said.
   The political opposition, the Roman Catholic Church and several
foreign governments, including the Reagan administration, have
urged Pinochet to lift the state of a emergency as a basic
condition for a clean referendum.
   In the referendum, about 7.2 million Chileans will vote ``yes''
or ``no'' on the single military-picked candidate. If he is
approved by voters, the candidate will start an eight-year term on
March 11, 1989. If rejected, an open election will be held within a
year, with Pinochet staying in power until then.
   No precise date has been announced for the vote, but Pinochet
and other government officials say it will be held in early October.

<TEXT>
   I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the
difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a
dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
   I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live
out the true meaning of its creed: ``We hold these truths to be
self-evident: that all men are created equal.''
   I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons
of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able
to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream
that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with
the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will
be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in
a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin
but by the content of their character.
   I have a dream today!
   I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious
racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words
of interposition and nullification, one day right there in Alabama,
little black boys and little black girls will be able to join hands
with little white boys and little white girls as sisters and
brothers. ...
   So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New
Hampshire; let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York;
let freedom ring from the heights of the Alleghenies of
Pennsylvania; let freedom ring from the snow- capped Rockies of
Colorado; let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of
California. But not only that, let freedom ring from Lookout
Mountain of Tennessee; let freedom ring from every hill and
molehill in Mississippi _ from every mountainside, let freedom ring.
   And when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we
let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state
and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of
God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles,
Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in
the words of the old Negro spiritual:
   ``Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at
last.''

   Tens of thousands of civil rights marchers
tried to recapture the spirit of Martin Luther King on the 25th
anniversary of his ``I Have a Dream'' speech Saturday with warnings
that the struggle to fulfill King's dream of equality is far from
over.
   Singing ``We Shall Overcome,'' demonstrators led by Jesse
Jackson, Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis and
Coretta Scott King, widow of the slain civil rights leader, marched
from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial waving signs
and banners in the hot midday sun.
   U.S. Park Police estimated the crowd at 55,000 people, far fewer
than the 250,000 who thronged the National Mall for King's famous
oration climaxing the March on Washington on Aug. 28, 1963, a crowd
that was equalled five years ago at a 20th anniversary march.
   Dukakis' appeal to banish all forms of racism and discrimination
was greeted warmly, but it was Jackson _ his former rival for the
Democratic nomination _ who got the biggest cheers of the day with
a scathing attack on Republican nominee George Bush.
   ``George Bush is not in Washington today,'' Jackson said to a
roar of approval. ``He must not be here for the Inauguration next
January.''
   The civil rights activist said that a quarter-century ago, ``we
looked forward to new frontiers'' under President Kennedy.
   ``Today, Reagan and Bush attempt to return us to an old
fortress,'' he said. ``They are trying to rebuild old walls. They
have fought to crush the dream.''
   Jackson made no mention of the Dukakis or the Democratic ticket,
but he appealed for his predominantly black audience to vote in the
Nov. 8 elections.
   ``Hands that once picked cotton can now pick mayors,
legislators, governors and presidents,'' he declared.
   Others at the rally echoed Jackson's message.
   ``Twenty-five years later, we are here stronger and more
determined than ever,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.
   Conyers told the demonstrators they were not marching so Jackson
could be the next president, ``but so that your son or daughter can
be a future president of the United States.''
   Ethel D. Smith of Washington, who had marched in 1963, brought
her grandson to the demonstration Saturday. Looking back, she said,
``A whole lot of doors have been opened, but we've got a long way
still to go.''
   Dukakis and Jackson met on the front ranks of the march for the
first time since the Massachusetts governor defeated the civil
rights activist for the Democratic nomination at last month's party
convention in Atlanta.
   Jackson led the monument rally in chants of ``Keep Hope Alive!''
and Dukakis claimed that only a Democratic president could help
meet the demonstrators' demands for full social and economic
equality.
   President Reagan, spending the day campaigning for Republican
candidates in California, issued a statement asserting that since
King led the landmark March on Washington in 1963, ``America has
made vast progress toward fully achieving Dr. King's dream of a
color-blind society.''
   As a result, Reagan said, ``America today is a freer land for
Americans of all backgrounds.''
   He added: ``On this anniversary, it is fitting that all
Americans should give thanks for that progress and for the work of
those who sacrificed so much to bring it about. And let us
remember, as well, that freedom is our unending challenge and our
continuing vocation as Americans.''
   But Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said the marchers are still
``looking for jobs, looking for peace and looking for freedom.''
   Referring to a campaign dispute between Dukakis and GOP nominee
George Bush, Rangel said freedom is not about reciting the Pledge
of Allegiance. Rather, he said, ``freedom means our children can
get an education as easily as they can get cocaine in our schools.''
   From the Washington Monument the demonstrators retraced King's
steps to the Lincoln Memorial, where Dukakis invoked King's ``I
Have a Dream'' speech a quarter-century ago.
   ``Let us, in the words of Dr. King, `transform the jangling
discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood,'''
Dukakis said to polite and friendly applause.
   ``We have to march not just so that some of us can reach the top
of the hill,'' Dukakis said. ``We must march until every American
has reached the bright sunshine of opportunity, until we can stand,
and stand together, in the golden glow of our shared dream.''
   ``We must march until racism and anti-Semitism and
discrimination of all kinds are banished from this land, until we
have a Justice Department that understands the meaning of the word
`justice,' until we have a civil rights commission that believes in
civil rights, and until we have a president who understands and
respects the Constitution of the United States.''
   Bush and his running mate, Dan Quayle, did not respond to
invitations to attend the rally, march organizers said. Bush was
campaigning Saturday in Texas.
   Jackson, in a speech on the eve of the rally, pledged to help
get out the vote this fall for the Democratic ticket of Dukakis and
Lloyd Bentsen. ``We do have a choice and a chance in November,''
Jackson said. ``Dukakis and Bentsen represent an alternative, a
chance to change.''
   At the time, the 1963 demonstration was the biggest ever held in
Washington. The peaceful, orderly march _ and King's galvanizing
speech _ are credited with spurring Congress to pass the landmark
Civil Rights Act of 1964 under pressure from President Johnson.
   Mrs. King said the 1963 march ``helped break the spine of racial
segregation'' in the United States, and that today ``we still have
a dream of a nation free of the cancer of racism.''
   The Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, recalled that King had said, ``America has
given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back
marked `insufficient funds'.''
   Lowery said the marchers had returned to cash that check.
   ``It's not that there are no funds,'' he said. ``It's that your
ways of accounting are faulty. We know the money is there. If you
don't cash it now, we will be back again and again and again.''

<HEAD>Police Say Palestinian Guerrillas May Have Crushed Boy's Skull</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>

   Police on Saturday found the body of an
8-year-old Jewish boy whose head was crushed with a rock, and they
said Palestinian guerrillas may have killed him, Israel radio
reported.
   Israeli troops shot and wounded eight Palestinians in clashes
Saturday, and four more were wounded in an argument with a fellow
Arab suspected of being an Israeli agent, hospital officials and
reporters said.
   Israel radio said police in the northern port city of Haifa
discovered the Jewish boy's body in a dry riverbed in his hometown
of Qiryat Tivon, 10 miles south of Haifa.
   Police found his skull cap, a sign that he was religiously
observant, and a large rock that may have been the murder weapon,
near the body, the radio said. They said Palestinian guerrillas
were suspected, but they did not elaborate.
   Palestinian professional leaders rejected charges that a
Jerusalem-based federation of professional groups closed Friday by
authorities had instigated anti-Israeli protests.
   Police said they ordered the building, which houses seven
professional groups including doctors, dentists and lawyers, shut
for one year because members were holding meetings under the
auspices of terror organizations and planned to ``establish
alternative structures to the Israeli administration.''
   Israel closed a West Bank union representing 38 different trades
on Thursday.
   ``The police accusations are groundless,'' said Walid Asali,
chairman of the Arab Bar Association. ``Our objectives are to help
out members, manage a retirement fund, plan lectures and license
new members.''
   Earlier this month, Israel outlawed the so-called popular
committees that have sprung up in towns and villages throughout the
occupied territories.
   The Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, criticized as ``one-sided'' the
U.N. Security Council's condemnation of Israel's policy of
deporting Palestinian activists.
   The Security Council on Friday demanded that Israel allow 33
activists already expelled to return immediately to their homes.
   ``Israel expresses displeasure with the Security Council's
one-sided approach, which ignored Israel's security needs,'' said
Ministry spokesman Alon Liel. He said Israel would continue to use
deportations selectively.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, the army imposed a curfew on the
Nusseirat refugee camp after troops opened fire to break up violent
demonstrations, residents said. Hospital officials said seven
residents suffered moderate wounds.
   An eighth man was in critical condition after being shot in the
abdomen during a protest at the nearby Bureij camp earlier in the
day, hospital officials said.
   Clashes also broke out in Rafah at the southern tip of Gaza,
where troops used tear gas and nightsticks to disperse more than
100 protesters who tried to hold an illegal march.
   The army also clamped curfews on three West Bank villages south
of Jerusalem, fearing renewed unrest.
   Underground Palestinian leaders had dedicated Saturday as a day
for ``striking forces to direct blows against those who refuse to
resign from their posts,'' referring to Arabs who work with Israeli
authorities.
   But the only attack reported occurred Friday night, when Labieb
Hassan, who fellow Palestinians say is an agent for the Israelis,
shot and wounded three Arabs who demanded he stop informing on
activists.
   A local reporter said the clash was in Illar, a small farming
village in the occupied West Bank.
   During the incident the mukhtar, or village leader, emerged from
his home with an army-issued submachine gun and also started
shooting, slightly wounding an elderly woman, the Arab reporter
said.
   The army refused to give details on the incident, describing it
as ``an argument between local residents.''
   Only Palestinians working for the Israeli military
administration are allowed to carry weapons.
   Palestinian leaders have been calling for the resignation of
Israeli-appointed mayors and other employees since the beginning of
the Arab uprising.
   Since it began Dec. 8, the Palestinian revolt against Israel's
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip _ seized from Jordan and
Egypt in 1967 _ has claimed 254 Palestinian lives. Four Israelis
have died.

   Vice President Salvador Laurel
announced a new opposition movement Saturday, claiming President
Corazon Aquino's ``blundering and immoral administration'' would
lead the country to disaster.
   Meanwhile, near the southern city of Zamboanga, Moslem rebels
burned a bus and a car and fled with 28 hostages, the military said.
   Laurel was joined by Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile and representatives
of several opposition groups, including the New Society Movement of
ousted President Ferdinand Marcos, in launching the Union for
National Action.
   ``I accept the honor and the challenge to lead a coalesced
opposition against a blundering and immoral administration that has
betrayed the people,'' Laurel told reporters. ``If (Mrs. Aquino)
continues to run the government, the country is headed for national
disaster.''
   The Union's platform calls for a new treaty on the status of
American military bases in the Philippines that would provide for a
gradual phasing out of the facilities over a 10-year period.
   The Union also called for replacing the U.S.-style presidential
government with a parliamentary system, as well as escalating the
battle against the Communist New People's Army, the armed wing of
the banned Communist Party of the Philippines.
   Mrs. Aquino had no reaction to formation of the Union. On Aug.
13, Laurel called Mrs. Aquino to resign or he would ``dissociate
himself from her government.''
   One week later, Mrs. Aquino said she would remain in office
until her term expires in 1992.
   Laurel ran for vice president with Mrs. Aquino against Marcos in
the 1986 elections. The Marcos-dominated parliament ruled that
Marcos had won the election, but he fled the country for Hawaii on
Feb. 25, 1986, after a civilian-military uprising.
   Mrs. Aquino named Laurel prime minister in her government, but
abolished the post soon afterward. Since then, Laurel has
complained he has been ignored by Mrs. Aquino's advisers.
   Laurel's political fortunes have been declining since September,
when he resigned as foreign secretary and refused to serve in the
Cabinet.
   Enrile, fired as defense minister on Nov. 23, 1986, after a
failed coup by his followers, said Saturday that the Philippines
faced the deepest crisis in its history because of ``a crisis of
leadership.'' He is the only opposition figure in the 23-member
Senate.
   The rebel attack near Zamboanga occurred at dawn on an isolated
stretch of highway on the island of Basilan, 560 miles south of
Manila, according to Lt. Col. Porcawa Dia, regional military
commander.
   Dia said three vehicles carrying 50 people bound for Zamboanga
were stopped by about 30 suspected members of the Moro National
Liberation Front.
   The guerrillas belong to the main faction of Moslem separatist
rebels seeking independence for the southern island of Mindanao.
   Dia said the rebels ordered the passengers to leave the three
vehicles, then set a bus and a car on fire before soldiers arrived,
he said.
   A gunfight broke out, during which eight of the passengers
escaped and 14 others were rescued by soldiers, Dia said. He said
the rebels escaped in the remaining vehicle with the other
passengers and were believed to be hiding in a nearby mountain
village.
   He said the area was cordoned off to prevent the rebels from
escaping.

   She stepped out onto the high bar with a
look of determination, quivering while she tried to steady herself.
The crowd gasped when she lost her footing, then broke into cheers
when she twirled her tail around the bar, saving herself from a
15-inch drop.
   Welcome to the second annual Rat Olympics, a lesson in patience,
sensitivity and positive reinforcement.
   Since June, about 50 psychology students at Kalamazoo College
have been training 11 white, pink-eyed rats to inch their way
across the 2-foot-long, quarter-inch-wide wooden bar, jump hurdles
and climb a 5-foot vertical screen.
   With a piece of chocolate chip cookie as bait, the beady-eyed
entrants in the Tri-Rathlon also had to climb a five-step ladder
and make their way through a tunnel and a pan filled with an inch
of water, to which most rats have an aversion.
   ``I was really afraid of them when we started, but they're
really very sweet,'' said junior Robin Lake, 19, of Traverse City,
as her rat, Mimi, crawled across her shoulders.
   Professor Lyn Raible said it all started as a way to teach her
students about learning and conditioning. But it turned into an
ethics lesson.
   ``In some of my classes we do live animal experiments with the
rats and I found this teaches sensitivity,'' she said. ``They
realize that rats have personalities and feelings, and it makes
them think twice before they do their experiment.''
   Though some students in the four-person teams refused to touch
the rats at first, almost all the racing rodents found homes with
their trainers after Friday's competition.
   ``We've been together about 10 weeks and we've gotten very
close,'' junior Tom Remble, 20, of St. Joseph, said of his rat, who
wore a Superman cape and had her tail painted red, white and blue.
   ``Most people think of rats as mean, but she's very peaceful and
affectionate,'' he said.
   Because pets aren't allowed in dormitory rooms, Remble's rat,
like many of her rivals, will be sent to parents. Asked if he
thinks his parents will be pleased with their new pet, Remble said:
``I don't know, but I'm sure my cats will be.''
   None of the rats will go back to the lab for experiments.
   ``My students would kill me,'' said Raible, who has been
researching brain chemicals that affect rats' sexual behavior.
   In fact, the small liberal arts college rolled out the red
carpet for the rodents. There was an opening ceremony and
procession of students to the tune of ``Chariots Of Fire.'' A
torch-carrying student wearing pointed ears and a tail was led down
a grassy hill by Raible, carrying a package of Oreos.
   The competitors all were female because, Raible said, male rats
are too ugly, fat and lazy.
   Black-robed judges held up numbers to rate each competitor. No
overall winner was announced, but the crowd of about 75 seemed to
agree the champion was Elle Dopa, named after L-dopa, a drug used
to substitute for dopamine, a brain chemical.
   This may be just the beginning of the path to stardom for
rodents with four-legged fortitude.
   Raible said she has twice sent videotapes to talk show host
David Letterman with the hope of getting the rats a spot on his
Stupid Pet Tricks segment. Both times she was rejected, because the
show doesn't consider rats pets.
   ``Can you imagine?'' she asked.

   Howls of protests over train whistles in Chicago
suburbs have reached the ears of the Illinois Commerce Commission,
which plans to take up the issue next week.
   A recently enacted state law requires trains to signal their
approach at all railroad grade crossings. But as train engineers
began complying and tooting at all intersections with roadways,
suburban residents found themselves suffering through sleepless
nights and angry days.
   ``I'm extremely tired and extremely annoyed,'' Mary Krippner of
Westmont said last week. ``Who's going to pay for my nervous
breakdown?''
   The commission on Friday authorized hearings beginning Tuesday
on possible exemptions to the new law.
   In the meantime, a Du Page County judge's temporary order
remains in effect barring four major railroads _ Burlington
Northern, Chicago & North Western, Soo Line and Wisconsin Central _
from sounding whistles in some suburban areas.
   Some of the railroads are interpreting the judge's 10-day order,
issued Thursday, as stretching beyond Du Page County, to the west
of Chicago, so they also have been keeping horns quiet in the
northern and southern suburbs.
   About 500 of the state's 13,000 railroad crossings are at issue
in the ICC hearings, which are expected to run at least two days,
said Bernard Morris, chief railroad engineer for the ICC. Morris
will act as hearing officer and make a recommendation to the
seven-member commission.
   ``I think we're going to hear a lot of people wanting to say
they don't like whistles or they don't want whistles near their
church or near their hospital because it's a nuisance,'' Morris
said Friday.
   He cautioned, however, that the law's wording may limit such
evidence.
   ``It says (exemptions can be granted) if the public is
reasonably and sufficiently protected,'' Morris said. ``It doesn't
say anything about not being able to sleep.''
   Asked whether the state legislature went too far in passing a
blanket whistle-blowing requirment, ICC Chairwoman Mary Meg
Bushnell said, ``I don't think they went overboard. I think they
didn't realize, perhaps what the consequences of this would be.''
   Alfred Ronan, the state representative who proposed the
whistle-blowing requirement, has defended it as a crucial safety
measure.
   ``I was trying to protect the people who don't pay attention
when they go through train stops, and I'd do it again,'' he once
said.

   It takes a lot to keep a
force of 1,000 firefighters going, and Karla McNary can lay her
hands on just about everything they might need.
   McNary is the distribution leader for the Wolf Lake fire camp
established at Canyon to funnel firefighters onto the Wolf Lake
fire in Yellowstone.
   From row after row of cardboard boxes stacked in her blue and
white tent, she can pull sleeping bags, fire resistant clothing,
gloves, goggles, hard hats, and fire hoses, of which more than
12,000 feet was dispensed Friday alone.
   There are also shovels; Pulaskis, a tool that is a cross between
an ax and a hoe; MREs _ meals ready to eat; and fire shelters.
Behind these piles are more piles of ground sheets, chainsaw kits,
chainsaw oil, earplugs, water jugs, files to sharpen the tools and
garbage cans.
   And then there are the drip torches, for starting backfires, and
kerosene lamps, to see by when you come off the fire lines after
sundown.
   McNary also has to keep track of all that gear.
   ``If it doesn't come back, then the crew that had it last is
responsible for it,'' she said in an interview late Friday. ``You
have to know exactly who's got it, when they're taking it, and when
they're bringing it back.''
   What's the most popular item in her inventory? Sleeping bags,
and not your average down or synthetic bag. These are made out of
paper, according to McNary.
   ``They go like wildfire,'' she said, realizing too late the pun
she made.
   Although made of paper, the bags endure a dry cleaning after one
use and are ready to go again.
   ``After that one cleaning, they throw them in the garbage,''
said McNary. ``They're just paper, regular paper. It's not much,
but it'll keep you warm.''
   But for real warmth in Yellowstone, where the night temperatures
in late August can dip into the low 30s, there's nothing like a
cardboard box, she said.
   ``A lot of people, to keep really warm, they'll sleep in
boxes,'' McNary said, explaining that the boxes left after the
equipment is doled out are quite popular with the firefighters.
   ``You improvise,'' she added.

<HEAD>Dukakis Marches With Jackson In King Tribute; Bush In Texas</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: New info in top 11 grafs including Jackson remarks, Bush
campaign explanation of no being at march; pickup 8th graf, ``I

   Michael Dukakis linked up with one-time Democratic presidential
challenger Jesse Jackson on Saturday for a quarter-century tribute
to Martin Luther King Jr. on the steamy hot steps of the Lincoln
Memorial.
   George Bush campaigned in Texas where his spokeswoman said he
had already agreed to address a Marine veterans group in Dallas
before being invited to participate in the Washington march.
   Press secretary Shelia Tate said the Bush campaign sent regrets,
and dispatched Bush's son Marvin to attend the march.
   Without mentioning the Reagan administration by name, Dukakis
said many of the late civil rights leader's dreams remain
unfulfilled and promised to work to change that if elected
president.
   ``We cannot look back or look down when we know that the cancer
of racism and bigotry is still with us and that over the healed
wounds of the past new wounds are opening in our cities and in our
suburbs,'' he said.
   ``We have to look up, because that march for good jobs and real
freedom didn't end that August afternoon 25 years ago. We have to
march on.''
   A crowd estimated by U.S. Park Police at about 30,000 gave
Dukakis a friendly reception and there were chants of ``Where is
George?'' after his speech.
   However, the warmest response was for Jackson, who did not speak
until after Dukakis had departed and did not mention the Democratic
presidential ticket specifically.
   But Jackson urged his followers to vote and it was clear it did
not mean for them to vote for the Republican ticket.
   ``George Bush is not in Washington today,'' he said. ``He must
not be here for the Inauguration next January.''
   Bush's decision to campaign in Texas emphasized his
determination to go all-out to win what his campaign chief termed
the must win state of all must win states.
   ``I mean to run hard to run hard, I mean to fight hard and I
mean to win Texas,'' Bush told a rally of party workers at Houston
hotel.
   The vice president praised his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana, and told the qroup he ``is going to be a tremendous asset
to this ticket and I am proud to have placed my bet on the future.''
   ``We have a new generation,'' Bush said. ``This man will measure
up.''
   He then left for a couple of late afternoon stops with campaign
chairman James Baker. It was Bush's first trip to Texas since Bush
was annointed the Republican presidential nominee in New Orleans
less than two weeks ago.
   Baker told reporters the election is ``one hell of a lot more
winnable (for Bush) than a lot of sages were saying just two weeks
ago.''
   ``If there was ever a `must' state for a presidential election,
Texas is it in 1988,'' Baker added.
   As if to underscore that strategic assessment, the Democratic
vice presidential nominee, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, wrapped up a
five-day campaign swing with an appearance at Austin, the capital
of his home state, before flying back to Washington. He attacked
Bush for what he termed ``an outrageous misrepresentation'' about
Dukakis.
   ``George Bush comes to Texas, goes to Longview, and charges Mike
Dukakis with being soft on the war on drugs,'' said Bentsen. ``That
is an outrageous misrepresentation of the facts.''
   Bentsen said the homicide rate in Massachusetts under Dukakis'
governorship is half the national average, that Dukakis has added
1,500 law enforcement personnel, and has pushed programs to help
victims of crime.
   ``I don't think (Dukakis' record) has been surpassed by any
other state in the nation,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Quayle was in California expressing confidence that
his campaign is getting off the dime after being bogged down by
questions about his National Guard service.
   At a news conference in Irvine, Quayle said he was pleased with
the response from the crowds during his first week on the campaign
trail by himself.
   ``I really feel a great deal of enthusiasm beginning to build,''
he said.
   Quayle was asked about comments by his wife, Marilyn, aired
Friday night on ABC's ``20-20'' suggesting that the media was out
to get her husband because he is a conservative.
   ``I am not going to disagree with Marilyn. Marilyn is my best
adviser and my strongest supporter,'' Quayle said.
   Pressed to say whether he believed the media was against him,
Quayle said, ``I just hope that the press will begin to focus on
the issues of this campaign.''
   Mrs. Quayle said she stood by her comments on the television
interview that the press had engaged in ``overkill'' in its
coverage of her husband. In New Orleans last week, she said ``we
had a real feeding frenzy'' by media, which has abated only
slightly.
   Quayle traveled to several rallies in California and a state
fair in Sacramento.

   FBI agents aided by a state Senate
staff member mounted a two-year sting to uncover corruption in the
Legislature, forming dummy companies that lured lawmakers with
bribes, a lawyer close to the investigation says.
   The investigation began when John A. Shahabian, facing
allegations of wrongdoing arising out of an earlier FBI probe,
agreed to cooperate with the FBI and assisted in recording
legislators engaged in allegedly illegal acts, Donald Heller,
Shahabian's attorney, said Friday.
   Shahabian was snared in the earlier FBI sting and told
authorities he would cooperate in an expanded probe into bribery
and extortion, Heller said.
   ``For years and years, there has been widespread corruption in
the Legislature ... a cesspool,'' Heller said. ``My client was
initially caught up in it and came forward and cooperated for two
years.''
   Lawmakers who were ``rumored to be on the take,'' were offered
illicit donations, Heller added, ``and sure enough, they took the
bait.'' He described the sting as ``creative and inventive.''
   Shahabian, a staff member of the state Senate Elections
Committee, pretended to be a part owner of one of the dummy
companies, Peachstate Capital West, a shadowy venture capital
company located above a store 1{ blocks from the Capitol. The other
two ``owners'' of the company were FBI agents, Heller said.
   Heller did not identify the lawmakers who were videotaped but
said he expected ``dozens of indictments soon.'' He did not
elaborate.
   Terry Knowles, agent in charge of the Sacramento FBI office,
said arrests in the case were not expected ``at the present time.''
   Late Wednesday and early Thursday, 30 federal agents with
warrants descended on the Capitol and searched the offices of four
lawmakers and their aides, seeking materials related to two obscure
bills. Both measures had been vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian,
who, unaware of the sting operation, described them as unwarranted
special interest bills.
   Capitol sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
four legislators whose offices were searched were Democratic
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore of Los Angeles, who wrote the two bills;
Republican Assemblymen Frank Hill of Whittier and Pat Nolan of
Glendale; and Democratic Sen. Joseph Montoya of El Monte.
   Nolan, the Republican leader of the Assembly, offered to resign
his leadership post Friday at a closed-door meeting in the wake of
the investigation, the San Francisco Examiner reported Saturday.
   Heller made the comments in a telephone interview from Hawaii,
where he was on vacation. Shahabian, who has declined to speak with
reporters, is also ``on a short vacation,'' Heller said.

   A judge has accepted an antique dealer's
$4.2 million offer for the 21-room mansion where Claus von Bulow
once lived with heiress Martha ``Sunny'' von Bulow.
   The oceanfront estate, Clarendon Court, is home to a prince and
princess and includes the three-story main house, an 18-room
carriage house, three fountains and a swimming pool.
   A New York judge overseeing the sale on Thursday accepted the
offer submitted by Glenn C. Randall of Washington, D.C.
   The mansion, which was built for the owner of the Pullman Car
Co., is owned by Mrs. von Bulow, 57, who has been in what doctors
describe as an irreversible coma since suffering a seizure at the
mansion eight years ago.
   Von Bulow, 62, was convicted of charges he tried to kill his
wife with injections of insulin and other drugs, but was acquitted
at a second trial in June 1985. He stood to inherit about $14
million of Mrs. von Bulow's Pittsburg utilities fortune, valued
then at $75 million.
   A committee handles Mrs. von Bulow's financial affairs because
of her condition. The judge's approval was needed for the sale.
   Last December, von Bulow agreed to divorce his wife and to
renounce all claims to her money in an out-of-court settlement to a
lawsuit filed by his stepchildren, Prince Alexander von Auersperg
and Princess Annie-Laurie ``Ala'' Auersperg Kneissl. They charged
that the Danish-born socialite had tried to kill and defraud their
mother.
   In exchange, the von Bulows' daughter, Cosima, was restored as
full heiress to one-third of her maternal grandmother's $100
million estate. The 20-year-old had been cut out of Annie-Laurie
Aitken's will for siding with her father in the family feud.
   Clarendon Court is not without its lesser-known tragedies as
well. In August 1982, Paul E. Molitor Jr., the late executive
director of the Newport Preservation Society, was living as von
Bulow's guest in the carriage house when he committed suicide.
   Despite, or perhaps because of, its sordid past, Clarendon Court
was much sought after when it went on the market in late June.
   ``There were almost continuous appointments for the couple of
weeks'' it was listed, said Robert Corbin, owner of Private
Properties. ``The publicity surrounding the von Bulow family was
very instrumental'' in its appeal.
   Mrs. von Bulow remains in New York's Columbia-Presbyterian
Hospital.

   Rain extended over parts of the South, the Southwest and
sections of the Plains on Saturday, and the Pacific states had
unseasonably hot weather.
   Showers and thunderstorms outlined the eastern edge of cooler
air pressing across the upper Mississippi Valley and the northern
two-thirds of the Plains. Behind the front, temperatures at noon
were only in the 50s and 60s.
   Showers and thunderstorms reached from Wisconsin across
Illinois, the central Missouri Valley, Kansas, western Oklahoma,
eastern Colorado, the Texas Panhandle and northeastern New Mexico.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended from southern Nevada
across Arizona, and from the coast of the Carolinas across Florida
and along the lower Texas Gulf Coast.
   Thunderstorms produced more than an inch of rain around
Charleston, S.C., causing local flooding around North Charleston
and Summerville, the National Weather Service said.
   A flash flood warning was posted for sections of northwest and
north-central Arizona, where thunderstorms moved over ground that
had been saturated by an inch or more of rain during the previous
48 hours.
   In the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 2.96 inches of rain fell near
Tampa, Fla., and 2.47 inches fell at Gainesville, Fla.
   A tropical storm watch was posted over the northwestern and
central Bahamas, because of a tropical depression centered about
125 miles east-southeast of Miami and moving toward the northwest.
   Temperatures over the Pacific states were warmer than
seasonable, reaching up to 90 over the Washington coast and more
than 100 across the desert Southwest during the morning.
   North-central Texas also had a few highs around 100, and highs
were in the 90s in much of Arkansas and from Alabama across Texas
into Oklahoma.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55 at
Crescent City, Calif., and Ely, Minn., to 105 at Palm Springs,
Calif. The nation's low Saturday morning was 33 at Butte, Mont.
   For Sunday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from
northern and western New York state across western Pennsylvania,
Michigan, the lower Ohio Valley, southern Illinois, southern
Missouri, Arkansas, northern Texas, southeastern New Mexico and
western Texas, as well as from the Virginia coast across central
Florida, and scattered from central Arizona into southern Utah.
   Highs in the 60s and 70s were predicted over the upper Great
Lakes, the northern two-thirds of the Mississippi Valley, the
northern and central Plains, the upper Missouri Valley, central
Arizona, and along the central coast of California; in the 90s from
southern New Jersey across the Carolinas and from the Tennessee
Valley across the central Gulf of Mexico states, southern Arkansas
through Louisiana, much of Texas, southern New Mexico, the Pacific
Northwest and the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah; in the
upper 90s across central and southeastern Texas; in the 90s to
about 110 from the desert Southwest across eastern California into
southwestern Oregon; and generally in the 80s over the remainder of
the nation.

Navy's nuclear arsenal.
   The Navy reported 10 minutes after the 4:04 p.m. EDT launch that
the test had been successful. The last Trident 2 launching, on July
7, ended when the missile veered off course and was destroyed by a
radio signal from the Air Force range safety officer.
   The 44-foot weapon has a range of nearly 6,000 miles, but
officials declined to disclose how far the test warhead package
traveled Saturday.
   Six more land pad tests are planned here, to be followed by at
least five launches from submerged submarines. The weapon is
scheduled to become operational and join the fleet late next year.
   Each Trident 2 is designed to hurl up to 10 nuclear warheads to
different targets. There will be 24 of the missiles aboard each
Trident submarine.

<TEXT>
   It's been one year of quiet persistence in
jail for plastic surgeon J. Elizabeth Morgan, who holds the keys to
her own freedom in the knowledge of her daughter's whereabouts.
   Although she has committed no crime, on Sunday Dr. Morgan, of
McLean, Va., who holds degrees from Harvard, Yale and Tufts, will
mark her first anniversary in a solitary cell at the District of
Columbia Jail.
   D.C. Superior Court Judge Herbert B. Dixon Jr. ordered her
jailed indefinitely on contempt of court charges until she produces
her 6-year-old daughter, Hilary, the centerpiece of a bitter battle
between Morgan and her former husband, oral surgeon Eric Foretich
of Arlington, Va.
   The thought of giving up ``would not cross my mind,'' said the
slightly eccentric, articulate Morgan in a recent interview. ``I do
my share of crying ... but I cannot think of a more sinful thing to
do than trash (Hilary) for my personal comfort.''
   Morgan, 41, hid the girl one year ago rather than allow Hilary
to have unsupervised visits with Foretich, whom she calls
``unstable, unpredictable, and violent.'' Morgan claims Foretich
has been sexually abusing the girl _ and her half-sister from a
previous marriage _ since before Hilary was 2.
   Morgan's claims have been buttressed by the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Virginia, which recently directed a lower court
to examine previously inadmissable testimony from doctors and
psychiatrists that Hilary has been sexually abused.
   That court has been hearing civil suits _ including Morgan's
damages suit against Foretich and his countersuit of defamation _
because the couple lived in Virginia during their marriage. But
since Morgan is now a Washington, D.C. resident, Dixon has
jurisdiction over the custody case. And he has refused to rule on
the allegations of sexual abuse.
   Foretich agrees that his daughter has been molested, but he says
it was Morgan who committed the atrocities against his daughter.
``It's sick,'' he said.
   Although Foretich recently agreed to supervised visits with his
daughter, were she to be found, Morgan refuses to allow it under
any conditions except at the request of Hilary and her therapist.
   ``I don't see why a child should have supervised visits with
their rapist,'' she said. ``I think that's sick.''
   Foretich, whose voice becomes forceful with emotion when
discussing the case, says he doesn't believe the authorities are
trying hard enough to find his daughter. He's offering a $2,000
reward to whoever finds Hilary, who turned 6 last week.
   ``If Elizabeth Morgan really loved this child, why would she put
her off somewhere away from both parents?'' he asked.
   Morgan says Hilary is safe and doing well, but will say nothing
more.
   ``I don't tell anybody anything to do with her,'' she said.
``For me to risk her safety is to risk her life,'' she added,
explaining that Hilary has been occasionally suicidal and would not
be able to handle more court battles and forced visits with her
father.
   ``It would certainly be the end of her sanity.''
   Foretich doesn't agree. ``She loved being with me; she wanted to
be with me ... Hilary and I have been the victims of all this,'' he
said.
   The bitter divorce and custody battles have been dragging on
since 1982, when Morgan left Foretich's Great Falls, Va., home a
week before Hilary was born. The mother was granted custody and
Foretich received liberal visitation rights.
   Morgan first reported that Hilary was being abused in 1984. Two
years later she refused to let Foretich visit his daughter.
Morgan's current jail term marks the third time she has been
incarcerated for contempt.
   Dixon has ruled that Morgan could remain in jail until Hilary
turns 18. Lawyers are appealing that decision.
   Former Maryland Attorney General Stephen Sachs, one of Morgan's
attorneys, says the purpose of contempt of court jailings is to
coerce a person to divulge information, and it's obvious Morgan
will not reveal her daughter's whereabouts.
   ``If the goal is to punish her ... she has the right to a
trial,'' Sachs said.
   The attorney also complains about the secretive nature of
Morgan's legal proceedings and wants future hearings to be public,
with no evidence or testimony supressed.
   Experts in the child abuse profession say it is unusual for a
mother to go to jail for so long to protect a child. But child
abuse cases are often entrenched in ambiguities.
   ``In general, cases of sexual abuse are very hard to try and
very hard to prove,'' said Anne Cohn, executive director of the
Chicago-based National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse.
``So in that sense, Dr. Morgan's case is not unusual.''
   Local child abuse experts generally believe Morgan's story,
``not that they necessarily believe what she's done is the right
thing,'' said Joan Danzansky, executive director of the
organization's Washington chapter.
   ``In the end it's the rare child who isn't better off having
some sort of relationship with both parents,'' Cohn explained.
   The National Organization for Women has lobbied in Morgan's
behalf and a support group called ``Friends of Elizabeth Morgan''
has staged a high-publicity awareness campaign aimed at securing
her release.
   About 50 of Morgan's supporters staged a demonstration Saturday
outside the District of Columbia judicial complex, and NOW
President Molly Yard told the group that women ``are themselves
being abused when they try to protect their children.''
   Morgan herself has gone public with her situation, making
personal appeals that have been published in The Washington Post
and U.S. News & World Report. She has also taken advantage of her
jail time to publish a textbook on cosmetic surgery, write several
short stories and complete a children's book.
   She finds inspiration from philosophical, historical and
religious reading. She cites ``Civil Disobedience'' by Henry David
Thoreau ``where he maintains that the law is wrong if it calls for
a citizen to be unjust to another citizen'' and William Shirer's
``The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'' because ``there are
several common elements (in child abuse and Hitler's Nazi Germany)
on a path of unopposed injustices.''
   She also spends time thinking about her future with Paul Michel,
a judge on the Federal Circuit Court, to whom she became engaged
just before she was jailed last August. The couple doesn't plan to
marry immediately after Morgan's release, however.
   ``We've decided to wait until the child is protected and can
return and become part of her new family from the start,'' Michel
said.
   As for Foretich, he believes the outcome of the case is out of
his control.
   ``I've put in the hands of the Lord,'' he said. ``I pray for
some resolution through him, and that some sanity will eventually
prevail in this case.''

Riots</HEAD>

   Graying, but for the most part still true to
their ideals, activists who demonstrated at the tumultuous 1968
Democratic National convention gathered Saturday to commemorate the
20th anniversary of the protests.
   ``It took quite a while to get here, but here we are,'' said
former Yippie Abbie Hoffman.
   About 400 people gathered in the 17,000-seat International
Amphitheater, where the convention was held. Then-Chicago Mayor
Richard J. Daley banned the demonstrators from the facility in 1968.
   Most of the participants _ including former Students for a
Democratic Society President Carl Oglesby and former Chicago Seven
defendants Hoffman and David Dellinger _ agreed that while the
goals they sought remain largely unfulfilled, their movement and
the Chicago protests had a positive effect on the country.
   ``What I saw and experienced in Chicago _ the police unleashed
like stormtroopers ... seeing that repression, seeing that
violence, and then seeing the response _ the fact that Mayor Daley
didn't scare us out of Chicago ... For the first time, I thought,
`I'm not a radical, I'm not a reformer. I'm a revolutionary,'' said
Stew Albert.
   ``We caused a lot of things to actually happen and change. We
broke down a lot of the racial barriers,'' added Bobby Seale, who
was ordered bound and gagged when he stood trial on conspiracy
charges stemming from the demonstrations.
   ``I'm very proud of my history. I don't regret one nickel of
it,'' said Seale, 51, now involved in minority recruitment at
Temple University in Philadelphia.
   ``I think we had a tremendous impact in sticking up for the
right to protest,'' said Hoffman, 51, a perennial activist who
calls himself ``an American dissident.''
   ``The incidents that happened here changed the way that police
forces are trained in America today,'' Hoffman said.
   During the 1968 convention, hundreds of protesters fought with
police in downtown Grant Park after Daley said they would not be
allowed to march to the amphitheater.
   Eight protest leaders were indicted on charges of conspiracy to
incite violence. They were known as the Chicago Seven because Seale
was tried separately.
   The atmosphere in the hall Saturday was a far cry from Aug. 26,
1968, when the Democratic convention formally opened. This time the
hall houses scores of sympathizers for those who were once barred,
and many of them set up tables to promote causes ranging from
Maoists to the Free Puerto Rico Committee and the League of Women
Voters.
   Only about 40 of those attending the conference participated in
the protests. Others said they were there for a sense of history.
   ``They're real history makers that I've studied,'' said Valerie
Yoshimura, a junior at the University of California at Santa
Barbara who was born two weeks before the convention. ``We have a
lot to learn from them.''

<HEAD>New Hampshire Legislator Eugene Daniell Dies At 83</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKLIN, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eugene Daniell, a self-proclaimed champion
of the underdog who once tear-gassed the New York Stock Exchange
and was known for his oratory in the state Legislature, has died at
age 83.
   The maverick nine-term state representative died Friday, said
Franklin Memorial Hospital spokeswoman Marcia Hansen. She would not
disclose the cause of death.
   Daniell, who retired from the Legislature in 1986, practiced a
stirring oratory style compared to that of unsuccessful
turn-of-the-century presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan.
But his politics were like those of Louisiana's populist U.S.
senator and governor, Huey Long, with whom Daniell briefly worked
until Long was assassinated in 1935.
   Throughout his career Daniell fought for redistributing
America's wealth. In 1933, he opened tear gas canisters near
ventilators in the New York Stock Exchange, and then waited to be
arrested. Unable to come up with a $500 fine, Daniell served 30
days in jail.
   ``As I saw it, that was the one institution that contributed
more than anything to the imbalance,'' Daniell said in a 1985
interview.
   After Long died, Daniell established a one-man law office in
Franklin.
   He was elected to his first of seven terms as mayor in 1948. The
following year, he was elected to the state Senate for one term. He
first won election to the House in 1961. He also waged several
unsuccessful campaigns for Congress on shoestring budgets.
   He was known for having compared President Reagan to Hitler,
pushing a resolution to recommend impeaching President Nixon, and
wearing his Army uniform as he marched in demonstrations against
the Vietnam War.
   After his wife, Eva, died in 1982 after much suffering, Daniell
fought for ``living will'' legislation allowing people to sign a
document barring the use of extraordinary means to continue life.
The Legislature eventually overrode Gov. John Sununu's veto of the
measure.
   He is survived by a son, Eugene Daniell of Concord. No funeral
was planned.

   President Reagan, rounding out a
million-dollar week of Republican fund-raising in his crucial home
state of California, warned Saturday that Democrats threaten to
``send the ship of state into drydock.''
   ``Our economy and our national defenses are strong, but they're
also under threat,'' Reagan said in a speech at a $200-per-person
money-raising event for Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, the congressman
from his district.
   ``They're threatened by those who want to use the law to
engineer the changes in our nation that American people do not need
and do not want and that would hurt,'' he said.
   After his speech on a spacious estate near Santa Barbara, the
president left for his 688-acre ranch north of here, ending a
five-day outing to Los Angeles. He will return to Washington after
Labor Day.
   Earlier in the day, Reagan appeared at a private party for
Republicans who contributed or raised $5,000 for the California
GOP. On his way to Los Angeles Monday, he spoke at a fund-raiser
for Sen. Pete Wilson.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the events raised
about $1 million altogether. Reagan is expected to play a key role
in the campaign for California's 47 electoral votes.
   In his speech for Lagomarsino, Reagan commented for the first
time on the dispute over Democratic presidential nominee Michael S.
Dukakis' veto of a proposed Massachusetts law that would have
required teachers to lead their classes in the Pledge of Allegiance.
   Touching on a Massachusetts program giving furloughs to
prisoners, for which Dukakis has been under fire in the campaign,
the president asked, ``And how about a furlough for the Pledge of
Allegiance?''
   Reagan also reiterated his support for the stand taken by Vice
President George Bush, the Republican nominee, in support of
Reagan's opposition to tax increases.
   Speaking to Californians accustomed to seeing tax measures
appear on the ballot under proposition numbers, he said, ``George
Bush is going to Americans with his own Proposition Number One: No
new taxes.''
   ``Our liberal friends seem to love to fiddle around making big
government even bigger,'' the president said. ``And then, before
you know it, they've fiddled around so much that they've sent the
ship of state into drydock.''
   Reagan conceded that Lagomarsino ``has a tough race, his
toughest ever'' from Democratic challenger California State Sen.
Gary K. Hart. But, he said, ``The job Bob has done these past 14
years has earned my vote this year.''
   The president spoke to a crowd of about 1,000 gathered in
sweltering, sunny weather on a broad lawn of the estate overlooking
the Pacific Ocean. He wore a jacket, but no tie and apologized for
this, saying he had just come from an event for which casual attire
was prescribed.
   As the president's motorcade drove up a winding road to the
site, he was greeted by signs opposing aid to Nicaraguan rebels,
such as ``Pledge to Resist U.S. War in Central America.'' There
also were friendly placards, such as ``Santa Barbara Loves the
Gipper.''
   In his weekly radio address, the president spoke of ``a move
toward peace that shows how successful this nation's commitment to
peace through strength has been.''
   Expanding on a theme he is expected to sound throughout the
campaign, he said, ``Peace is a godly thing, but men are seldom
godly. What we've learned is that peace is hard to achieve unless
the forces of good have the strength to stand firmly for it.''
   Ticking off areas of the world in which he said there have been
advances toward peace, he added, ``There is still time to turn the
tide in Nicaragua.''
   Sen. John Glenn delivered the Democrats' response, accusing the
president of heeding political pressures, and in the process
weakening the nation's defenses, when he vetoed the $299.5 billion
military budget bill on Aug. 3.
   The Ohio lawmaker noted that Reagan's veto came despite
recommendations to sign the measure from Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci and National Security Adviser Colin Powell.
   ``His actions should be condemned by all Americans who value a
strong national defense,'' Glenn said of Reagan's decision.
   Congress will resume consideration of Reagan's request for
renewed aid to Nicaraguan rebels when it returns to session after
Labor Day.
   Reagan recorded his radio speech before leaving Los Angeles.
   In a statement issued in Los Angeles, he noted the 25th
anniversary of the civil rights march on Washingtgon led by Martin
Luther King Jr., and said, ``Since that day a quarter century ago,
America has made vast progress toward fully achieving Dr. King's
dream of a color-blind society. As a result, America today is a
freer land for Americans of all backgrounds.''

   Five men protesting what they called the
executions of more than 400 people under Cuban President Fidel
Castro's regime handcuffed themselves to a handrail in the Statue
of Liberty's crown Saturday.
   The men stood in line with tourists about two hours before
climbing to the top of the statue.
   Police clipped the cuffs after about an hour, cited the men for
assembling without a permit and ordered them to leave. They left
Liberty Island by ferry, said Tom Bradley, deputy superintendent of
the Statue of Liberty National Monument.
   The men wanted to call attention to an incident on Aug. 30,
1962, when ``more than 400 people were executed by a firing squad
under orders of Castro,'' said Saul Pedrera, a spokesman for the
protesters.
   The Statue of Liberty was chosen because it is a well-known
symbol of freedom, Pedrera said. No one was hurt and the protesters
were carrying no weapons.
   The men, who ranged in age from 48 to 58, were not arrested, but
were ordered to post $150 bond each within 10 days.
   Some 18,000 visitors were expected at on Liberty Island on
Saturday.

   A man accused of stealing more than
$500,000 from pay telephones and who twice was the subject on the
``America's Most Wanted'' television program has been arrested.
   James Clark, 49, of Peninsula, Ohio, was arrested Friday night
following a three-year, nationwide search, police said.
   Clark's arrest at an undisclosed residence in this Orange County
community, about 20 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, was
unrelated to his mentions on the Fox network's crime program, said
Lawrence G. Lawler, special agent in charge of the FBI's Los
Angeles office.
   ``He may not be `Jack the Ripper,''' Lawler said, ``but he is a
one-of-a-kind thief. His total take exceeds half a million dollars.
We're glad to have him in custody.''
   An FBI spokesman said Clark was arrested without resistence, but
would not say what led agents to find him.
   Clark allegedly picked locks to remove coins from phones, the
FBI said.
   Clark was arrested on a fugitive warrant from Ohio. He was being
held at the federal prison at Terminal Island and was to appear
before a U.S. magistrate in Los Angeles on Monday, the FBI said.
   ``America's Most Wanted'' capsulizes real, unsolved crimes.
Viewers are asked to contact local law enforcement agencies if they
have information concerning the crimes.

<TEXT>
   A group of Navajo Indians led by Tribal
Chairman Peter MacDonald defied the Hopi Tribe and a congressional
mandate Saturday and began repairing homes located on Hopi land.
   The Navajo-Hopi Relocation Act of 1974 partitioned some 1.8
million acres of land that once was occupied by both tribes. The
Hopis have left land assigned to the Navajos, but about 200 Navajo
families refuse to leave land now designated as Hopi.
   Federal officials and Hopi Chairman Ivan Sidney contended the
Navajos should get permission from the Hopi Tribe before making
repairs to those homes, but MacDonald said Navajos would not
consent to relocation, as the Hopis wanted in return for permission.
   MacDonald, wearing a brand new tool belt and blue jeans rather
than his customary three-piece suit, watched as tribal employees
and volunteers put a new roof and windows in a home owned by
Jeannie Paddock, 75.
   Other volunteers worked on homes elsewhere on the land, the
ownership of which has been disputed by the two tribes for more
than a century. Some repair plans went awry as rain turned dirt
roads into mud bogs, and two cement mixers sank to their hubs.
   MacDonald said crews would continue work Sunday and Monday,
beginning with homes in the greatest state of disrepair.
   ``These families have a right to repair their houses,'' he said.
``These people don't want to leave. They believe they belong here.''
   He added that he feared Navajo children and elderly tribal
members could die if their homes were not repaired before the onset
of a cold winter.
   Sidney said MacDonald should provide homes on Navajo land if
he's so concerned about his tribe's well-being.
   ``MacDonald talks about relieving hardships and building houses
on our land, but if he is really worried about relieving hardships,
why can't he build them homes on his side?'' Sidney said Friday.
   But MacDonald said people like Mrs. Paddock do not want to leave
their traditional homes and Mrs. Paddock, speaking through an
interpreter, agreed.
   ``For many years I have been asking for repairs,'' she said.
``This is our land. This is where we were born and we're going to
resist. We're not going anywhere.''
   Sidney has said the Hopis will go to court to seek a restraining
order against MacDonald.

   Police searched Saturday for an inmate wanted on
murder charges who escaped from jail using a ``John Dillinger
special'' _ a fake gun carved from a bar of soap that fooled a
guard.
   Victor Thomas, 27, told Cook County Jail officials that he was
ill and wanted to go to Cermak Memorial Hospital, which is
connected to the jail by a tunnel, said Robert Glotz, assistant
director of the county corrections department.
   In the basement of the hospital, the inmate pulled out a weapon
made of soap and threatened the unarmed guard escorting him, Glotz
said.
   Thomas tied up the guard, then took his uniform, badge and
wallet and walked out of the jail complex Friday, he said.
   ``People here are saying he got out using the John Dillinger
special,'' said an officer in the Cook County sheriff's department,
who spoke Saturday by telephone on condition of anonymity. ``There
are many ways out and he used the oldest ruse _ the phony gun
routine _ and it worked.''
   ``It was quite a work of art,'' said the officer, describing the
soap-bar gun. ``It was black with some light blue highlighting _
probably made with a marker pen _ it was approximately the size of
.25-caliber automatic pistol with a delicately carved barrel,
grooves and a trigger guard.''
   According to legend, Dillinger escaped from a jail in Crown
Point, Ind., in 1934 after brandishing a fake gun that he carved
out of wood. The legend lives though it later was revealed
Dillinger accomplished the escape with a real .45-caliber automatic.
   Glotz said Thomas had been in jail for a year on three armed
robbery charges. His soap gun was recovered a block from the jail.
   Thomas was in jail on three counts of armed robbery, police
said. He also is wanted in California for the March 3, 1987,
slaying of three alleged drug dealers who were strangled or stabbed
to death in the Los Angeles area, police said.
   About 40 officers were looking for Thomas on Saturday,
interviewing acquaintances and checking areas Thomas has been known
to frequent, said police Sgt. Tom Whalen.
   According to the ``Encyclopedia of American Crime,'' the story
that Dillinger used a wooden gun to escape was a hoax to cover up
the fact that the real gun had been smuggled into the jail by an
Indiana judge bribed by Dillinger's lawyer.

   Michael Dukakis joined thousands Saturday to
mark the 25th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s march on
Washington and promised to pursue the slain civil rights leader's
famous dream if elected president.
   ``We must march until we reach the finish line at the top of the
hill and there we will find no barriers separating us one from the
other,'' Dukakis told a rally at the Lincoln Memorial after the
anniversary march.
   ``There, we will merge the reality of America with the promise
of America,'' he said. ``There, together, together, we will fulfill
the American dream.''
   Dukakis and his wife, Kitty, marched from the Washington
Monument to the Lincoln Memorial in a row of dignitaries that
included King's widow, Coretta Scott King, Jesse Jackson, Dukakis's
former rival in the Democratic presidential race, NAACP Executive
Director Benjamin Hooks, the Rev. Joseph Lowery and Atlanta Mayor
Andrew Young.
   Dukakis saluted Mrs. King and his former rival, referring to
Jackson as a man ``able to lift the hopes and spirits of millions
of Americans with the energy and vision and the excitement of his
campaign. Dr. King must be very proud of Jesse Jackson.''
   Dukakis was well-received by the gathering and there were chants
of ``Where is George?'' after Dukakis completed his speech.
   He also took time before the speech to meet with representatives
of several black media outlets, promising to bring more Jackson
supporters into his campaign and to campaign hard for the black
vote.
   Jackson, who did not speak until after Dukakis had departed, did
not mention the Democratic presidential ticket specifically.
   But he urged his followers to vote and it was clear it did not
mean for them to vote for the Republican ticket.
   ``George Bush is not in Washington today,'' he said. ``He must
not be here for the Inauguration next January.''
   In rhetoric unlike any Dukakis had delivered previously to a
predominantly black audience, the Massachusetts governor likened
King to Lincoln, using uncharacteristically emotional language in
his tribute.
   ``Like the man whose memorial we gather at today, Martin Luther
King Jr. changed the course of history,'' Dukakis said. ``And as
Abraham Lincoln, in his time, defined our nation's course at
Gettysburg; so Dr. King, in his time, defined America's soul.''
   Dukakis continued: ``The dream he shared with us that afternoon
25 years ago was more powerful than any single cause. It soared
above all barriers of race and creed and it has endured and
expanded through time because it was born of a profound optimism
about life. It was nurtured by faith in the promise of America. It
was sustained by his belief that we Americans _ for all our
wonderful diversity, and it is a wonderful diversity _ are one
people, one nation, one community.''
   Dukakis recalled racial beatings and bombings and the
assassination of President Kennedy that occurred the same year of
King's march and said that while much progress toward the
realization of King's dream has been made that much more needs to
be done to ``deliver America from the scourge of racism and the
slow death of indifference.''
   ``We cannot be satisfied to rest here,'' Dukakis said in quoting
Kennedy. ``This is the side of the hill, not the top. ... We have
made a beginning, but we have only begun.''
   The Democratic nominee promised to lead a nation that will
``march on'' to fulfill King's call for racial harmony.
   Dukakis, without directly mentioning the Reagan administration,
said a litany of problems facing minority Americans have not been
addressed, including discrimination, a lack of fair housing and
affordable health care, poor schools, high teen-age pregnancy rates
and infant mortality and shoddy enforcement of civil and voting
rights laws.
   He applauded Bush for supporting antidiscrimination laws to
protect AIDS victims but also left little doubt about his
perception of the Reagan administration's record on issues of
concern to minority Americans.
   ``We must march until we have a United States Department of
Justice that understands the meaning of the word justice,'' he
said. ``We must march until we have a civil rights commission that
believes in civil rights. My friends we must march until we have a
president who understands and respects the Constitution of the
United States.''
   Dukakis ended his speech with a rhetorical flourish more likely
to come from Jackson than Dukakis.
   ``Let us, in the words of Dr. King, `transform the jangling
discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood,'''
Dukakis said. ``Let us look up. Let us march on. And little by
little, step by step, hand in hand, together, we will overcome.''

   A Far East team won the 42nd Little
League World Series Saturday _ the fifth year in a row _ as Tai
Chung, Taiwan, defeated Pearl City, Hawaii, 10-0, behind the
pitching of Chen-Lung Yu.
   Yu relied on a 75 mph fastball against the Hawaii team.
   ``He was really throwing hard,'' Pearl City coach Richard Numata
said. ``I guess he was a little bit too strong for us.''
   Yu, a 5-foot-4{-inch, 134-pound right-hander, pitched all six
innings, striking out 10 while walking one. He retired the last 17
batters in order.
   Manager Ta-Yuan Lai said Yu picked up confidence as the game
went along.
   ``In the first inning he was not as stable as he was
afterwards,'' said Lai, who managed the 1981 Little League champion
from Tai Chung.
   Chris Yoshimoto had the only hit for Pearl City, a community of
40,000 people near Pearl Harbor.
   Pearl City starter Ryan Morioka was the losing pitcher. The
4-foot-11, 91-pound righthander allowed two runs on two hits, using
mostly a curveball.
   An estimated 20 million people watched the game on ABC-TV.
   Tai Chung is a city of 700,000 people in central Taiwan.
   Teams from Taiwan have won the series for three consecutive
years, outscoring their American opponents 41-3.
   Korean teams won the championship in 1984 and 1985. Far East
teams have won 18 of the past 22 years.

   A diving bell carried 18 sailors to safety
from a crippled submarine Saturday, one day after the vessel sank
to the ocean floor after it was accidentally rammed by a Japanese
fishing boat, Peru's navy said.
   At least three other crewmen were believed still trapped inside
the damaged submarine, which was in 96 feet of water, but
authorities said the sailors were expected to be rescued Saturday
night.
   The submarine Pacocha sank after being accidentally rammed
Friday evening by the Japanese fishing ship No. 8 Kyowa-Maru near
the port city of Callao, the navy and the Japanese Embassy said.
   Four people _ the commanding officer and three junior officers _
were killed immediately after the crash and three crew members
remained unaccounted for, said navy spokesman Luis Castro.
   Castro said 22 other crewmen were rescued as the vessel sank
when they donned life preservers and jumped into the Pacific
Ocean's frigid waters.
   At least 21 others went down with the vessel and rescuers worked
into the night and through Saturday to free them. By late Saturday,
all but three had been rescued.
   Official navy accounts have varied as to the number of crew
members on board the vessel when it collided with the fishing boat,
the number who have not been accounted for and the number believed
trapped inside vessel.
   Earlier, authorities said 52 sailors were on board the vessel
when it collided with the fishing boat and that 24 were on board
when it sank.
   But Castro's most recent count indicated that 50 people were on
board the ship and that 21 had been trapped.
   On Saturday, rescuers used a diving bell that attached to the
hatch of the submarine and began bringing crew members to the
surface from the submarine.
   The bell, linked to the surface ship by a cable, was bringing
crew members up two at a time, Castro said.
   Callao, Peru's largest port, is eight miles west of Lima. Port
traffic was banned until Monday to facilitate rescue operations,
the port authority said Saturday.
   Helicopters and navy rescue boats could be seen maneuvering off
the port, but officials refused to allow journalists into the area.
   Castro said the 1,870-ton submarine, which was cruising on the
surface toward the port, sank shortly after being rammed on the
left stern side by the 412-ton, steel-hulled fishing boat.
   There were no reported injuries on the fishing boat.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman who declined to be named said the U.S.
Navy was sending a special team and equipment aboard three C-141
transport planes to assist in the rescue operations.
   The U.S. equipment includes a diving bell designed for submarine
rescues, the official said. The Peru navy did not describe the
diving bell already used in the rescue.
   Sources close to the rescue said the trapped men were believed
to be in the forward part of the submarine and had sealed the
section with hatch doors from the rest of the vessel, which is
believed filled with water.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an air
line running to the surface had been attached, giving survivors an
unlimited supply of air.
   The Peru navy said the submarine was purchased in 1974 from the
U.S. government. The vessel, formerly the U.S.S. Atule, was
commissioned on June, 21, 1944, according to Jane's Fighting Ships.
   The submarine sank shortly after impact, Castro said, adding he
did not know the extent of the damage to the craft.
   Castro said divers working since 8 p.m. Friday made contact with
crewmen inside the sunken vessel.
   The Callao port authority said the submarine was heading for
naval ship repair docks and the Japanese boat, carrying a crew of
21, was leaving port to fish when the accident occurred.
   The Japanese boat, skippered by Tsukasa Ohkado, suffered some
cracks on the bow, the Japanese Embassy said Saturday.
   The embassy said 16 of the Japanese boat's crew are Japanese and
the remaining five are Peruvians.

   Moslem guerrillas held two Afghan
provincial capitals Saturday and battled communist soldiers for two
more as they struggled to tighten their hold around Kabul, rebel
leaders and Western diplomats said.
   Meanwhile, Tass reported from Moscow that the rebels killed four
people, including two children, in a rocket attack on the Kabul,
the Afghan capital. The official Soviet news agency said the
``barbaric'' attack wounded 12.
   Rebels have been increasing their rocket attacks on Kabul since
Soviet troops began withdrawing from Afghanistan on May 15.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
guerrillas captured the city of Bamyan, about 70 miles northwest of
Kabul, in mid-August.
   Official Radio Kabul said government forces had to ``change the
status of their deployment'' in central Bamyan province after
several days of fighting with the rebels. It did not elaborate.
   Taloqan, the capital of northern Takhar province, has been in
guerrilla hands since Aug. 15, when the Soviets said they reached
the halfway point of their troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, the
sources said.
   They said guerrillas overran the city of Kunduz in neighboring
Kunduz province about the middle of August, but government forces,
with heavy Soviet air support, wrested it back several days later.
   Since then, the rebels have again laid siege to Kunduz and the
southeastern provincial capital of Kandahar but have not captured
them, the sources said.
   Rebel commanders say their strategy is to take the provincial
capitals, then to stage an assault on Kabul, the fortress-like
capital that is expected to be the last stronghold of the departing
Soviet army.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help the
communist government fight the U.S.-backed guerrillas. On April 14,
the Soviet Union agreeed to withdraw its estimated 100,000 troops
beginning May 15, 1988 and ending Feb. 15, 1989.
   At the Shindand air base in western Afghanistan, Soviet and
Afghan troops recently clashed over the alleged rape of an Afghan
woman, according to Agency Afghan Press, a Pakistan-based
pro-guerrilla news service.
   In another incident, two Soviets, three Afghans and an Indian
landed two Soviet helicopter gunships inside the Pakistani border
Wednesday and asked for asylum, according to the semi-official
Pakistani News Agency. Pakistani authorities Friday denied the
report.
   Guerrilla leaders mourned the loss of their Pakistani supporter,
President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, who died in a plane crash Aug. 17
that also killed U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel and 28 others.
   The guerrillas and some Pakistani officials have blamed the
crash on sabotage by agents of the Kabul government.
   ``The late Zia is a victim of the Afghan holy war, who possesses
a lofty place in the caravan of Afghan martyrs,'' said guerrilla
leader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar in a statement Saturday.
   Zia, an army general, championed the guerrillas' cause and
offered Pakistani territory for their training and supplies. The
new government, under acting President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, has
pledged to continue Zia's policy.

   More than 500 prisoners escaped from a
southern jail Saturday and 36 were killed trying to flee another
prison, state radio said. A popular former defense minister joined
calls for an interim government to end nationwide turmoil and
restore democracy.
   Unrest continued after massive demonstrations this month ended
26 years of authoritarian rule. Mob lootings were reported in
several areas, including the capital, where 150 people stole 7,000
gallons of fuel from a railway station.
   State-run Rangoon radio said more than 500 prisoners overpowered
guards early Saturday to flee from their jail in Mergui, 350 miles
southeast of Rangoon. It was the third mass prison escape in three
days.
   The radio said that on Friday, guards at the Insein jail, eight
miles north of central Rangoon, fired on 2,000 prisoners who set
fire to buildings and tried to break open the gates.
   ``Prison personnel had to control the situation and unavoidably
had to shoot,'' the radio said. ``As a result, 36 prisoners were
killed and 103 injured.''
   The British Broadcasting Corp. had reported Friday that the
rebellion at Insein left about 1,000 dead, but that report could
not be independently verified.
   The Rangoon radio broadcast said all buildings at the jail
burned to the ground but did not say if the rioting was over. Some
injured prisoners remained untreated because they tried to prevent
medics from entering the prison.
   Authorities at Insein also released at least 655 prisoners, some
because they were nearing the end of their sentences and some for
good conduct.
   The radio also reported prison riots Wednesday at Bassein, 90
miles west of Rangoon, where one inmate was killed and 100 escaped,
and Thursday in the Arrakan state bordering Bangladesh, where six
inmates were killed and about 1,600 escaped.
   Tin Oo, a popular former defense minister and retired general,
told about 50,000 people in Rangoon on Saturday that Burma needs a
transitional government now to end the month-long turmoil that has
toppled two leaders, sparked almost daily protests nationwide and,
by official count, killed at least 112 people.
   ``Following the recent public demonstrations against the
one-party regime, the light of democracy has now been visible,''
Tin Oo said.
   ``The situation in the country is still very delicate with
demonstrations continuing in many cities,'' he said. ``I therefore
urge the government to immediately form an interim government to
ease the situation and ... to prepare for democratic reforms.''
   The widely respected Tin Oo, 62, was removed as defense minister
and army chief in 1976 by former leader Ne Win. Once considered the
third most powerful official with a strong military following, he
was jailed after an investigation into an alleged plot against the
government.
   Thakin Soe, a former communist leader, issued a statement from
his hospital bed calling for multiparty democracy and demanding an
interim government to restore peace.
   Thakin Soe formed the now obsolete ultra-radical Communist Party
of Burma in 1937.
   The turmoil in Burma began July 23 with the resignation of
77-year-old Ne Win, who took over in a military coup in 1962 and
presided with an iron hand over Burma's economic destruction. The
Burma Socialist Program Party, the country's only party, named
hardliner Sein Lwin to succeed him.
   During demonstrations against Sein Lwin, hated by the public for
his alleged brutal suppression of dissent, army troops fired into
crowds of protesters. The government said 112 were killed, but
diplomats said the toll may be much higher.
   Sein Lwin resigned Aug. 12, and was replaced Aug. 19 by Maung
Maung, the first civilian president in 26 years.
   But even Maung Maung's announcement Wednesday that he would
recommend a popular referendum on one-party rule has not ended
protests.
   Rallies have been peaceful since Sein Lwin quit, but law and
order has deteriorated since Maung Maung lifted martial law
Wednesday.
   ``Security in the city ... isn't so good, especially after the
darkness comes on,'' said an Asian diplomat. ``The streets are
nearly empty at night. Theft and looting cases are reported
incessantly.''
   The government has been silent on the most recent protests and
on the stream of demands from prominent figures for immediate
democracy. That silence along with deterioriating social conditions
has provoked rumors that Ne Win and other officials may be
preparing to flee Burma.

   Communist Party officials criticized the
government of Prime Minister Zbigniew Messner on Saturday as
Poland's leaders struggled to solve the economic problems that have
bred widespread labor unrest.
   Eleven strikes continued at mines, ports, shipyards and
factories throughout Poland, but there were no reports of police
attempts to dislodge the striking workers.
   The Communist Party's 230-member Central Committee met on
Saturday and several delegates lambasted the government's handling
of Poland's dire economic problems and the labor unrest.
   Messner, prime minister since 1985, acknowledged the criticism
in a speech in which he reviewed his government's performance and
stressed its plans to improve the economy, the state news agency
PAP said.
   In opening remarks to the party meeting earlier, Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski said that the communist government would undertake a
``self-critical analysis'' of the problems behind the latest wave
of strikes in Poland.
   Messner, as head of the government, oversees the various
ministries and is theoretically responsible for government
performance. But ultimate power rests with the Communist Party led
by Jaruzelski.
   PAP said the party plenum would continue on Sunday.
   On Saturday, the government was attacked by a series of
committee members as ineffectual. Some of the sharpest criticism
came from Politburo member Alfred Miodowicz, leader of the official
trade union alliance OPZZ, which was set up after authorities
crushed the Solidarity union in 1981.
   ``Nothing can explain the sluggishness in solving various
problems, the failure to make progress,'' Miodowicz said, according
to PAP. ``Hence, the so-determined voices demanding personal
accountability.''
   Aleksandra Koszada, a party member from a radio plant in Kutno,
said, ``It is tragic that the conviction is becoming widespread
that only strikes can prod our government into resolute action.
   ``The government's ineptitude is responsible for many economic
problems and wasted years,'' added Bogdan Borys, a metalworker from
Czestochowa.
   The attacks added strength to speculation that the plenum would
lead to government changes, perhaps replacing Messner himself.
   The meeting was held less than a day after the government
offered to begin talking with workers, possibly including
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   But speakers also railed against the strikes. ``They have an
anarchy-generating, destructive character,'' said Politburo member
Jozef Czyrek. ``They cannot be accepted.''
   Jaruzelski denied that the party session was a direct result of
the strikes. But he said the meeting would make a ``critical and
self-critical analysis of the causes for the present tensions.''
   Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak on Friday proposed
unconditional talks with the striking workers.
   ``I have been authorized to promptly hold a meeting with
representatives of various social and employee groups. I am not
laying down any preconditions either concerning the subject matter
of the talks or ... the participants,'' Kiszczak said on national
television.
   ``Excellent,'' said Adam Michnik, a senior Solidarity adviser
reached in Gdansk after Kiszczak's speech. ``I believe this is the
first serious step in the right direction.''
   Striking workers at the Stalowa Wola steelworks in southeast
Poland said they responded to the offer by empowering Walesa and
the Catholic bishops to negotiate their demand of legalizing
Solidarity.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban, asked Saturday in a telephone
interview if Kiszczak's proposal would exclude Walesa, replied,
``No.''
   ``The proposal is directed at all who do not reject the existing
legal and constitutional order,'' he added.
   Solidarity, the first independent union in the Soviet bloc, was
crushed during a wave of strikes in 1981, when marshal law was
declared. The union was outlawed in 1982.
   Walesa, who founded Solidarity in 1980, said Friday he was ready
to talk to authorities at any time without any preconditions.
   Workers at the striking 30 Years of People's Poland mine in the
southern city of Jastrzebie voluntarily abandoned their occupation
strike at 7 p.m. Saturday because of a fire that started in the
coal mine before the strike began Aug. 19.
   Urban earlier said authorities might deploy police at the mine
because of the underground fire. Until Saturday, striking miners
remained inside the shaft, denying that the danger was critical.
   Several dozen miners at the Moszczenica coal mine in Jastrzebie
who had barricaded themselves in an underground shaft emerged at
noon Saturday after talking to a priest, officials and activists
said.
   In recent days, the government has used a combination of limited
force and propaganda against the strikers. Police have evicted some
striking miners in the coal-rich Silesia region, as well as some
transit workers from depots in the northwestern port of Szczecin.
   Striking dockworkers in Szczecin said talks with management
begun Saturday broke off without any results.
   Jaruzelski said the Central Committee meeting would work out a
program to improve people's living standards and market stability,
as well as to end Poland's rising wage-price spiral.
   ``In short, what is needed is a brave turn,'' he said at the
plenum, parts of which were televised.
   Politburo member Wladyslaw Baka, a reformer in charge of
economic poliy, said the Politburo had rejected a price freeze, but
it plans other steps to curb 60 percent annual inflation and
improve erratic supplies to the marketplace.
   A special Parliament commission on the economy is scheduled
Wednesday and the full Parliament is expected to meet shortly
thereafter.

   Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser
Arafat on Saturday asked the United Nations to play a larger role
in protecting Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   ``There was a long discussion about all aspects of the
Palestinian question,'' U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar told reporters after a 90-minute private session with
Arafat at the U.N. office here.
   ``He conveyed to me his concern about the fate of the
Palestinians in the occupied territories, which I do share,'' Perez
de Cuellar said.
   Since the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8 in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, more than 250 Palestinians have been killed,
most by Israeli gunfire. Four Israelis also have died.
   Perez de Cuellar said the PLO chief also raised ``other
political aspects of the problem.'' He did not elaborate.
   A statement issued by the PLO Saturday said Arafat, during the
meeting with the U.N. chief, ``stressed the need for immediate
international measures to ensure the protection of the Palestinian
people and also to provide for their support.''
   The statement also said Arafat briefed Perez de Cuellar on steps
taken by the PLO ``to assert the sovereignty of the Palestinian
people over its homeland and the assumption by the PLO of its full
responsibilities as the sole legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people.''
   Arafat has floated the idea of asking for a U.N. peacekeeping
force in the occupied territories if the Arab-Israeli conflict is
settled. A PLO official said before the meeting that Arafat would
explore ways of involving the world body directly in the
territories, including a possible trusteeship.
   One agenda topic was believed to be the possible creation of a
provisional Palestinian government and proclamation of independence
in the territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East
war and home to 1.5 million Palestinians.
   A related issue would be securing international recognition of
such a state. The PLO is backing its claim with a 1947 Security
Council resolution envisioning a Palestine partitioned into
separate Jewish and Arab states.
   Arafat also was expected to urge stronger involvement of the
U.N. in efforts to call an international Middle East peace
conference.
   The uprising and the July 31 decision by King Hussein of Jordan
to sever ties with the West Bank and Gaza have led the PLO to take
a more active role in the territories.
   A special meeting of the Palestine National Council, the
Palestinians' parliament in exile, was expected to discuss the
independence issue the middle of next month, but a top PLO official
said Saturday in Tunis the session probably will be put off until
after September.
   On Friday, the U.N. Security Council issued a statement backed
by all 15 members expressing concern over Israeli policies in the
occupied territories.
   The statement spoke of a ``grave and serious situation resulting
from the closing-off of areas, the imposition of curfews and the
consequent increase'' in dead and injured.
   The council also demanded that Israel stop deporting Palestinian
civilians from the occupied territories.

<HEAD>Prosecutor: Policeman Killed Neighbor After Long Grudge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EPPING, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police officer has been charged with
murder in the shotgun death of a neighbor that authorities said
stemmed from a 14-year-old grudge.
   Robert A. McLaughlin, 47, an 18-year veteran of the Hampton
Police Department, surrendered to state police Friday and confessed
to killing real estate broker Robert Cushing in June, said Barbara
Keshen, an assistant attorney general.
   A district court judge arraigned McLaughlin on a first-degree
murder charge Saturday at Portsmouth Hospital, where he was being
treated for high blood pressure. McLaughlin was being held without
bail.
   Keshen said at a news conference that the shooting apparently
stemmed from an incident about 14 years ago in which McLaughlin
made a misdemeanor arrest and Cushing became involved indirectly.
Keshen gave no further details of that incident.
   ``Since that period of time (McLaughlin) had evidently harbored
ill will feelings against Mr. Cushing that seem to have come to a
head on the evening of June 1, where he admitted that he took his
shotgun, loaded it, went over to the Cushing residence and shot Mr.
Cushing,'' Keshen said.
   Cushing, 63, was shot when he answered his front door.
   Hampton Police Chief Robert Mark said in a telephone interview
that he could not comment on the case, but he described McLaughlin
as a ``model policeman. He had a very good record.''
   ``He was what you wanted cops to be _ sharp, clean cut,'' Mark
said.

<HEAD>Women Saved From Brink of Horseshoe Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two women were rescued from the
brink of Horseshoe Falls after they jumped from their boat and
clung to rocks until workers rescued them.
   Janelle Spain, 25, and Karen Himmel, 23, of Hammond, Ind.,
suffered only bruises in the accident Friday night, authorities
said.
   They were unfamiliar with the river and drove their boat through
control gates at the International Central Dam. Once a boat passes
the control gates it has reached a point of no return, one official
said.
   Niagara Parks Police said the women lost control of their boat,
apparently after it hit rocks in the shallow water near the falls.
   ``They had no knowledge of the danger involved because it was
apparently their first venture into the area,'' said Niagara Fire
Chief Gilbert Neufeld.
   Passers-by saw the women in the 16-foot boat above the falls and
called police. When authorities arrived about 20 minutes later the
pair had abandoned ship and were fighting the current a few hundred
yards from the brink.
   Ms. Himmel was rescued by workers who threw her ropes and pulled
her over a retaining wall.
   Ms. Spain lost her grip and was swept down the river toward the
173-foot-high falls before grabbing onto another rock. She was
rescued by a fireman who, connected to a lifeline, swam out about
150 feet to her, officials said.
   Operators closed off control gates to lower the level of the
river and slow its pace approaching the falls, exposing rocks so
the women could grab onto them.
   The two women, who were camping on the Ontario side of the river
at the time of the accident, were treated for bruises at a hospital
and released.
   Last month, four boaters were rescued from rocks 40 feet above
the falls by workers who formed a human chain and waded into the
river's rapids. Those boaters had begun drinking while sitting
aboard the craft in a marina, authorities said, and hadn't realized
how it had drifted.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet diplomat said Saturday that he was
optimistic a quick agreement could be reached between China and the
Soviet Union on the conflict in Cambodia.
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev arrived in the
Chinese capital for talks set to begin Sunday. Asked by reporters
at the airport if a breakthrough was imminent, Rogachev said, ``I
think so.''
   His Chinese counterpart, Deputy Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei,
was more cautious, saying only, ``We hope to make some headway.''
   The two nations broke off relations in the early 1960s over
ideological and strategic differences. Normalization talks opened
in 1982, but they bogged down over three major obstacles: Moscow's
support of Vietnam's nine-year occupation of Cambodia, Soviet
troops in Afghanistan, and Soviet forces stationed along the
Chinese border.
   With the Soviet pullout from Afghanistan and a reduction of
forces along the border, Cambodia could be the last obstacle to
normalizing relations.
   If the conflict there is resolved, it could also pave the way
for a summit meeting between Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
   The communist giants have not held a summit in 30 years.
   ``We see some light at the end of the tunnel,'' Rogachev said of
the Cambodia talks.
   Rogachev said he expected the talks to last about a week. It
will be the first time the two sides have met solely to discuss
Cambodia.
   Rogachev he did not reveal what was on the agenda for the talks,
which are closed to foreign reporters.
   ``We are waiting for initiatives from the Kampuchean (Cambodian)
side. We, with our Chinese colleagues, can only facilitate or
assist in the settlement,'' he said.
   He also said a final solution would have to await the outcome of
a meeting in November between Cambodan resistance leader Norodom
Sihanouk and Hun Sen, prime minister of the Hanoi-backed government
in Cambodia.
   China has said it wants the Soviet Union to put pressure on
Vietnam to completely pull out of Cambodia as soon as possible.
Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in 1978, has agreed to withdraw
50,000 troops, about half its forces there, this year and all its
troops by 1990.
   In the past, China has backed the communist Khmer Rouge rebel
faction in Cambodia. It now supports a four-party coalition
government made up of the three resistance groups, including the
Khmer Rouge, and Hun Sen's forces. The government would be headed
by former national leader Sihanouk, who remains probably the most
popular political figure in Cambodia.

   Sen. Dan Quayle said Saturday he is
pleased with the response from crowds during his first week on the
campaign trail by himself.
   ``I really feel a great deal of enthusiasm beginning to build,''
the Republican vice presidential nominee said at a news conference.
   Quayle was asked about comments by his wife, Marilyn, aired
Friday night on ABC's ``20-20'' suggesting that the media was out
to get her husband because he is a conservative.
   ``I am not going to disagree with Marilyn. Marilyn is my best
adviser and my strongest supporter,'' Quayle said.
   Pressed to say whether he believed the media was against him,
Quayle said, ``I just hope that the press will begin to focus on
the issues of this campaign.''
   Mrs. Quayle said she stood by her comments on the television
interview that the press had engaged in ``overkill'' in its
coverage of her husband. In New Orleans last week, she said ``we
had a real feeding frenzy'' by media, which has abated only
slightly.
   Quayle traveled to several rallies in California and a state
fair in Sacramento.
   At Lake Mission Viejo Park, Quayle got a rousing reception from
the audience, which carried signs reading ``Pro-Lifers for Quayle''
and ``I don't Love the Liberal Media.''
   He warned them that a victory by Michael Dukakis would mean a
return to the economic doldrums and the weakness of national
security during the Carter years.
   ``If America liked Jimmy Carter, they are going to love Michael
Dukakis,'' he said.
   At the California State Fair, Quayle hopped on an antique
reaping machine and pitched hay. He then drove a tractor, telling
reporters afterward, ``I haven't done this in a long time.''
   He also presented ribbons to a group of 4-H teens, who had
trained guide dogs for the blind.
   When he handed a ribbon to one student, he bent and pet her dog,
a black Labrador retriever named Madonna, who sat up and licked his
face.
   When he got to the next dog, however, the animal just lay on the
ground without reacting.
   ``Now I know how it feels to be hounded,'' Quayle quipped.
   At the news conference, Quayle reiterated his position that
there is nothing left to ask or answer about his membership in the
Indiana National Guard during the Vietnam war.
   ``There have been a lot of innuendoes out there over the last
few weeks implying that somehow there was undue influence used in
getting into the National Guard, which we've denied from the very
beginning,'' Quayle said.
   ``The facts are now out and there is no longer a discussion,''
he said.
   Records released Friday by the Indiana National Guard confirmed
both that the headquarters detachment he joined was under strength
when Quayle enlisted in May 1969 and that a slot also was available
at the time he transferred into the command's public information
unit.

   A California chef to the stars, clothing
designer Norma Kamali and Woody Allen's set designer are among the
celebrities who will show off their house-decorating skills in a $1
million AIDS fundraising effort.
   The group will redecorate an 18th century brownstone town house
off New York's Park Avenue, which then will be displayed to the
public in October.
   The artists want to raise the money for the Design Industries
Foundation for AIDS, which funds programs around the country. The
benefit's advisory board includes Barbara Walters, Walter Cronkite,
Yoko Ono, Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward.
   ``Just as design exploded with opportunity for talent ranging
from fashion to furniture, from cars to faucets, from cooktops to
cosmetics ... the design-related industries have been hit by a
plague more devastating than anyone could have imagined,'' the
foundation said in a statement.
   AIDS is ``wiping out the pool of design talent which has only
just blossomed in America. It's costing us our friends, our
colleagues, our heroes,'' the statement said.
   An anonymous couple donated their brownstone for the project and
will stay in their old apartment while the public troops through
the house.
   Chef Wolfgang Puck, the owner of the trendy West Hollywood
restaurant Spago, is creating the kitchen. Architect Michael Graves
is doing the foyer, while artist David Hockney chose the dining
room.
   Working on other rooms and the garden are Kamali; movie set
designer Santo Loquasto; architect Michael McDonough; American
interior designers Mario Buatta, Mark Hampton, John Saladino and
Jay Spectre, as well as France's Andree Putman and Italy's Ettore
Sottsass; and art dealer Holly Solomon.
   The $1 million fund-raising goal involves expected proceeds from
sales of donated objects and merchandise at the house, an art
auction and a $300-a-person dinner at which Robin Williams will
entertain and well-known chefs will prepare the food.
   Metropolitan Home will feature photographs of the show house in
a special February issue, donating 5 percent of the issue's
advertising revenues to the foundation, said Dorothy Kalins, the
magazine's editor and an organizer of the project.

   Clyde Lee Conrad, a former Army sergeant
who marked his 41st birthday Saturday in a West German prison after
his arrest on espionage charges, has not been allowed to speak to
his parents, the family said.
   ``We love him, and we are quite certain he needs moral
support,'' Conrad's father, Harry Conrad told The Alliance Review.
``There's no way we can take back what has happened, but his mom
and dad and family love him and he has our prayers.''
   Clyde Conrad, who allegedly led a spy ring that provided U.S.
and NATO military secrets to the Soviets, faces espionage charges
carrying a maximum 10-year sentence.
   The Conrads, in an interview published Saturday afternoon, said
they have not been allowed to speak with their son since his arrest
Tuesday in Frankfurt, West Germany.
   Calls by The Associated Press to the family's home in Alliance
went unanswered Saturday.
   The newspaper said the Conrads would ask U.S. Rep. Ralph Regula
to help them obtain permission from the West German government to
talk to their son.
   No request for help had been made Saturday and Regula, R-Ohio,
planned to be away from his home near Canton until Tuesday, the
congressman's son, David Regula, said.
   Conrad grew up in Sebring, a town of about 5,000 in a rural area
55 miles southeast of Cleveland. He entered the Army after his high
school graduation in 1965, and his father and mother, Anna Conrad,
and his sister, Karen Henschen, moved to Alliance, four miles west
of Sebring. A brother, Darell Robert Conrad, lives in Boca Raton,
Fla.
   ``I always thought I knew my son,'' Harry Conrad said. ``We were
pretty tightly wrapped. If I had had this knowledge before it would
have killed me. It's about to kill me now.''
   Relatives and acquaintances said Conrad seldom returned home
from Germany.
   ``He always distanced himself from us,'' Ms. Henschen said. ``He
didn't see big opportunities in Sebring. Joining the military was a
way for him to travel.''
   ``He is a stranger we're talking about. He's someone I really
don't know, even though we share same parents,'' she said.

<HEAD>Thousands Protest Treatment by Ethnic Albanians, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 10,000 chanting Serbs and
Montenegrins rallied Saturday to protest alleged harassment by
ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo, the official news
agency reported.
   The protest was held in Vrbas, about 110 miles north of Belgrade
in the Vojvodina province, the Tanjug news agency said.
   It said protesters shouted ``Give Us Arms'' and ``Better a Grave
than a Slave'' during the rally.
   The report said about 1,000 protesters had traveled from the
southern province of Kosovo for the rally in Vrbas. Serbs and
Montenegrins in Kosovo say they are being persecuted by ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population.
   The demonstration was the latest in a series called to support
demands by hardline communist leader Slobodan Milosejvic in the
nation's largest republic, Serbia.
   Though nominally autonomous, the provinces of Kosovo and
Vojvodina fall under partial administrative control of Serbia.
Milosejvic has demanded even stronger central control over the
provinces.
   Federal authorities, meanwhile, have warned against arousing
political passions and seeking solutions to problems on the streets.
   Government officials say more than 34,000 people have left
Kosovo, claiming discrimination and harassment, since riots broke
out in 1981 while ethnic Albanians demanded greater autonomy for
the province. At least nine people died in that unrest.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. soldier was seriously
injured and 62 others were hurt during overnight rioting by 2,500
rock music fans in Schweinfurt, police said Saturday.
   Police said groups of drunken fans went on a rampage through the
downtown area of the Bavarian city, attacking pedestrians and
smashing store and car windows, leaving the streets littered with
debris.
   In a statement to the news media, Schweinfurt police said
several hours of rampaging by the mostly youthful fans began
shortly before midnight Friday and continued until about 4 a.m.
   About 600 police were called in to quell the fans.
   Police said the American soldier, who was not identified by
name, was stabbed in the chest by an unknown assailant. The soldier
was taken to a local hospital where his condition was serious but
not life-threatening, police said.
   Those arrested face charges including vandalism, causing bodily
injury, and possession of illegal drugs, police said.
   Schweinfurt, with a population of about 52,000, is 135 miles
north of Munich.
   Some 40,000 rock music fans were expected in the city for a
Saturday afternoon open-air concert billed as ``Monsters of Rock,''
which includes such groups as Iron Maiden, David Lee Roth and Kiss.
   On Aug. 20, two young men were trampled to death and two
seriously injured when a large wall with a video screen collapsed
during a ``Monsters of Rock'' concert in Castle Donington, England.

<HEAD>Abortion Protesters Freed In Atlanta, Arrested In Chicago</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-one anti-abortion activists arrested in Atlanta during
the Democratic National Convention revealed their identities to
police and were freed from jail Saturday, after spending 40 days
behind bars.
   Earlier Saturday, 14 people were arrested after they blocked the
entrance to an abortion clinic in Chicago, and in Pottstown, Pa.,
74 activists have been found guilty of trespassing stemming from a
July 5 demonstration outside a clinic.
   The protesters freed in Atlanta were among 134 arrested July 19.
Three of those arrested during the convention remained in jail,
including one who has been on a water-only fast since his arrest.
   ``I want everyone to know this is not a sign that we are giving
up,'' said the Rev. Edwin Arentsen, 71, of Illinois, who was
involved in the Atlanta demonstrations. ``We are going to return to
our homes and we are going to recruit more people to come to
Atlanta.
   ``This is not the end,'' he said. ``It's only the beginning.''
   The fasting inmate, who as part of his protest would identify
himself only as Baby John Doe, was hospitalized Friday, said Fulton
County sheriff's Maj. A.M. Alexander.
   ``His fast shows how determined and committed we are to stopping
abortions,'' said the Rev. Jessie Lee of New York, who left Atlanta
on an evening flight but vowed he would return.
   Officials with Operation Rescue, the New York-based group that
organized the protests, had said demonstrators hoped to overcrowd
the prison system by refusing to give their real names to police,
thus making them ineligible for bond.
   But job and family commitments have made staying in prison
difficult for protesters, who have come from New York, California,
Virginia and Illinois, said Operation Rescue spokeswoman Juli
Loesch.
   In Chicago, police were unable to take two of the protesters
into custody because they locked themselves to a bar attached to a
concrete block, and a locksmith failed to break them free after
working for more than an hour.
   The clinic's director called the protest by about 30
demonstrators an outrage, but an anti-abortion activist defended
the protesters' tactics.
   ``This is a death camp. As far as we're concerned this is just
exactly the same as Auschwitz or Buchenwald,'' Joseph Scheidler,
head of the Pro-Life Action League, said at an earlier protest at
another clinic.
   Seven men, six women and a 16-year-old girl were arrested for
sitting in front of the clinic door, said Patrolman Gene Nero. They
were to be charged with trespass, mob action, and resisting arrest,
police said.
   About 30 pro-choice activists gathered across the street and
cheered as the protesters were taken away.
   In Pennsylvania, 74 activists were found guilty Friday of
trespassing outside a women's health clinic in Paoli. Two more
hearings are scheduled to assess fines in the 591 arrests during a
demonstration organized by the Binghamton, N.Y.-based Operation
Rescue at the Women's Suburban Clinic.

   A diving bell slowly carried 21 sailors to
safety from a crippled submarine Saturday, one day after the vessel
sank to the ocean floor after it was accidentally rammed by a
Japanese fishing boat, officials said.
   The accident on Friday killed four people and three other crew
members still were missing, Peru's navy said in a statement.
   The navy said earlier that 22 sailors wearing life preservers
had been plucked from the Pacific Ocean as the vessel sank.
   But rescuers had struggled since late Friday to rescue sailors
still believed trapped alive in the vessel after it sank in 96 feet
of water near the port city of Callao.
   Using a diving bell and retrieving officers two at a time,
rescuers pulled 21 sailors from the submarine by late Saturday,
officials said.
   President Alan Garcia told reporters that three men were taken
unconscious from the stricken vessel, and that they may have been
overcome by fumes in the submarine. There was no word on their
condition.
   He said the three sailors still not accounted for could be in
water-filled compartments of the vessel. Garcia spoke to reporters
in his office after spending several hours at the accident site.
   The submarine Pacocha sank after being accidentally rammed
Friday evening by the Japanese fishing ship No. 8 Kyowa-Maru near
the Callao, the navy and the Japanese Embassy said.
   The navy said in a communique that the craft's commanding
officer, Daniel Nieve, and three junior officers had been killed.
   The navy on Saturday had issued several conflicting figures on
the number of men on board the ship, the number believed missing
and those feared trapped in the sunken vessel.
   It said 52 crew members were believed on board when the
collision occurred and said 45 were rescued. But the 22 crew
members rescued Friday and 21 rescued Saturday total 43, and there
was no explanation given for the discrepancy.
   Rescuers used a diving bell that connected to the hatch of the
submarine and began bringing crew members to the surface from the
submarine Saturday morning.
   Callao, Peru's largest port, is eight miles west of Lima. Port
traffic was banned until Monday to facilitate rescue operations,
the port authority said Saturday.
   Cmdr. Luis Castro, a navy spokesman, said the 1,870-ton
submarine, which was cruising on the surface toward the port, sank
shortly after being rammed on the left stern side by the 412-ton,
steel-hulled fishing boat.
   There were no reported injuries on the fishing boat.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman who declined to be named said the U.S.
Navy was sending a special team and equipment aboard three C-141
transport planes to assist in the rescue operations.
   Garcia said Peru officials decided to mount their rescue after
determining that it was too dangerous to wait for a special U.S.
Navy rescue crew to arrive Saturday night.
   Sources close to the rescue said the trapped men were believed
to have been in the forward part of the submarine and had sealed
the section with hatch doors from the rest of the vessel, which is
believed filled with water.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an air
line running to the surface had been attached, giving survivors an
unlimited supply of air.
   The Peru navy said the submarine was purchased in 1974 from the
U.S. government. The vessel, formerly the U.S.S. Atule, was
commissioned on June, 21, 1944, according to Jane's Fighting Ships.
   The submarine sank shortly after impact, Castro said, adding he
did not know the extent of the damage to the craft.
   Castro said divers working since 8 p.m. Friday made contact with
crewmen inside the sunken vessel.
   The Callao port authority said the submarine was heading for
naval ship repair docks and the Japanese boat, carrying a crew of
21, was leaving port to fish when the accident occurred.
   The Japanese boat, skippered by Tsukasa Ohkado, suffered some
cracks on the bow, the Japanese Embassy said Saturday.
   The embassy said 16 of the Japanese boat's crew are Japanese and
the remaining five are Peruvians.

   Ousted Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle
slipped out of his hiding place in Panama City and arrived here

   Juan Sosa, the ambassador to the United States under Delvalle,
denied that Delvalle is fleeing Panama, WCIX-TV reported. Sosa
would not say whether the visit involves efforts to overthrow
Panama's military ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noreiga.
   ``He has an agenda,'' Sosa said. ``We're not divulging the
agenda for obvious reasons. President Delvalle is committed to
establishing a democracy in Panama _ that's as far as I will go in
my comment.''
   The U.S. government still recognizes Delvalle as his nation's
chief of state despite his February overthrow by Noriega.
   Delvalle has been in hiding in Panama with the help of the
United States since Feb. 26, when Noriega replaced him with Manuel
Solis Palma.
   An Air Force jet carrying Delvalle and his wife Marianella
arrived Saturday afternoon at the general aviation ramp at Miami
International Airport, WCIX reported. The couple were met by secret
service agents.
   The Delvalles had enough luggage to fill the bed of a pickup
truck. The secret service said Delvalle is under 24-hour protection
at an undisclosed South Florida location.
   Sosa, who is recognized as ambassador by the United States but
not by Noriega, said from Washington that he'll meet with Delvalle.
Sosa would not say whether Delvalle will meet with U.S.
administration officials.
   State Department officials were unavailable for comment Saturday
night.
   Delvalle visited Miami in July for a heart checkup. He had heart
bypass surgery about 10 years ago and is supposed to have a checkup
every six months, but this visit is unrelated to Delvalle's health,
Sosa said.
   After Noriega was indicted in Florida on charges of drug
trafficking, Delvalle tried to fire him as head of the country's
military. But Noriega refused to go, and instead had Delvalle
replaced.

   Attendance by black students in Amite
County schools rose slightly Friday, the second day of a boycott to
protest alleged racism in the school system.
   Officials said 486 students attended school Friday, 136 of them
black. On Thursday 460 students, including 126 blacks, attended the
first day of classes.
   Last year more than 2,100 students attended county schools.
Enrollment figures until the first day of school. The school system
is 76 percent black.
   About 25 pickets were outside the office of School
Superintendent Maurice Foreman. On Thursday, about 300 blacks,
about half of them children, rallied in front of the office.
   A list of demands was presented to the school board in July,
including: replacing Gloster High School's new principal, Robbie
Robertson, who is white, with a black person; hiring an assistant
superintendent of education, preferably black; and abandoning plans
to consolidate schools in Liberty and Gloster.

   Police filed criminal charges Friday against
a woman whose 3-month-old baby girl died from being left in a
closed car on a scorching July day.
   Cindy Henry, 23, a secretary, will be summoned by mail to a
Sept. 23 hearing on charges of involuntary manslaughter, reckless
endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child, said
Magistrate Richard Orendorff.
   Investigators said that with the air temperature approaching 100
degrees on July 7, the temperature in the car probably reached 150
degrees.
   Jacqueline Lynn Henry died of dehydration and overheating,
according to Indiana County Coroner Thomas Streams. She was
strapped in a rearward-facing child seat, and the mother apparently
forgot to take her to her day care center and overlooked the child
when she parked the car on the way to work that morning,
investigators said.
   The tragedy was discovered when Mrs. Henry arrived at the day
care center after work and asked for Jacqueline, witnesses said.

   A retired U.S. Army sergeant who allegedly
headed an international spy ring that sold NATO secrets to the
Soviets held a top secret security clearance but never had the
periodic mandatory followup review, according to U.S. officials.
   An Army spokesman said Friday that the soldier, Clyde Lee
Conrad, held a ``top secret'' clearance from 1978 until his
retirement in 1985.
   ``Normally, a background check is done every five years,'' said
Army spokesman Lt. Col. Greg Rixon.
   But Rixon acknowledged that Conrad had never been subjected to
the usual follow-up background investigation to keep his clearance.
   ``In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Defense Department fell
behind and they weren't getting them done that quickly,'' the
spokesman said.

   The Palestine Liberation Organization is
on the verge of proclaiming an independent Palestinian state that
would recognize Israel's right to exist within pre-1967 boundaries,
senior PLO officials say.
   The PLO also will set up a provisional government to run the
state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, occupied by Israel since
1967, with Yasser Arafat's old guard sharing leadership for the
first time with young militants in the territories, the officials
say.
   ``We have the people and we have the land. With the declaration
of our government, we would have fulfilled all the prerequisites
for an independent state,'' chief PLO spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif
said last week in a telephone interview from Baghdad.
   The provisional government is expected to be announced when the
450-member Palestine National Council, a kind of
parliament-in-exile, meets in Algiers, Algeria.
   Palestinian leaders agreed to hold the meeting, originally set
for Sept. 20, sometime ``after September,'' said Salah Khalaf,
second-in-command to PLO chairman Yasser Arafat. He said the delay
will give the PLO leadership time to ``crystallize a clear and firm
vision and define the steps it will take.''

a West German newspaper said Saturday.
   West German prosecutors, meanwhile, said U.S. officials first

   American diplomats in Panama are facing a
variety of real and potential problems brought on by the Reagan
administration's decision to have no dealings with that country's
military-dominated government, U.S. officials say.
   In addition, harassment of American servicemen is on the
increase, prompting U.S. military officials to take precautionary
measures. Panamanian officials respond that troublemakers among
U.S. military personnel pose daily headaches for Panamanian
authorities.
   The State Department's constraints on U.S. envoys are such that
they are prohibited from carrying out even simple tasks, such as
renewing their license plates or their driver's licenses.
   As a result, many diplomats have been forced to rent cars rather
than run the risk of driving with expired plates. Some make their
rounds with expired driver's licenses, worried what local
authorities might do if they catch them in a traffic violation or
an accident, the officials said.
   The diplomats lack the documents entitling them to diplomatic
immunity. Thus, they are subject to imprisonment if found guilty of
a legal infraction.

<HEAD>NYSE's First Detailed Breakdown of Program Trading Raises New
Questions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A simmering debate about program trading has
resurfaced with a New York Stock Exchange report that shows the
computer-driven technique accounted for only a tenth of the Big
Board's business last month.
   If the report was meant to show program trading isn't an
important element in the stock market's post-crash malaise, it
didn't convince many critics.
   Instead, the report raised new concern about what some opponents
of program trading see as the insidious influence of a high-tech
strategy that is little understood and widely feared by a broad
range of investors and brokers.
   ``I'm not in favor of program trading. The very philosophy is
alien to stock market investing,'' said Rao Chalasani, a market
strategist at the Cleveland-based investment firm of Prescott, Ball
& Turben Inc. ``Program trading has scared people away.''
   The NYSE, increasingly concerned about investor apathy since the
stock market collapse 10 months ago, issued its first monthly
report on program trading this past week.
   It showed that program trading comprised 10.1 percent of the
exchange's average daily volume of 166.9 million shares in July,
and that most program trading was conducted by a handful of big
investment firms.
   The nation's largest stock market, where the overwhelming level
of program trading is executed, said the report was part of what it
called a broader policy of making as much information available to
investors as possible.
   But the report got a lukewarm reaction at best, partly because
it gave no comparable figures for program trading during the crash
and its aftermath.
   Some studies have suggested the strategy accounted for 15
percent or more of the frenzied volume on Black Monday; others say
it was as low as 7 percent. But regardless of the volume level,
some critics say that's not the point and only obscures the real
concerns about program trading.
   ``Ten percent doesn't sound very high. But probably 90 to 95
percent of the time there are no programs being executed,'' said
Carmine Grigoli, equity portfolio strategist at the First Boston
Corp. in New York.
   ``It's just a very small timeframe that program trading tends to
move the market dramatically,'' Grigoli said. ``There you'll come
up with a very different picture.''
   Chalasani said, ``it's not the volume of program trading that
matters, but how concentrated it is and how fast it's executed.
That's what creates more volatility. Ten percent volume executed at
10 times during the day isn't the same as when it comes all in the
last ten minutes of the day.''
   John Bachmann, chairman of the Securities Industry Association,
was more receptive to the NYSE report, saying in a telephone
interview that it was at least a first step toward understanding
program trading's influence.
   ``The point is, we're doing something,'' he said. ``What's
significant is not the number. It's that you have a number. Whether
this is the number that's going to be the most illuminating, I have
my reservations.''
   Program trading was developed in the early stages of the 1982-87
bull market that collapsed with frightening speed last October.
   The strategy, which some studies have linked to the crash,
involves the use of high-speed computer delivery systems to quickly
buy and sell stocks or groups of stocks based on pre-programmed
mathematical formulas.
   The most common and controversial form of program trading is
called index arbitrage, in which traders buy stock-index futures in
Chicago futures markets and sell big groups of the underlying
stocks comprising those indexes in New York, or vice versa, to
profit from fleeting price disparities.
   Defenders of the practice claim it stabilizes stock prices by
keeping them from straying too far from futures prices. Critics
contend that because the high-risk futures markets are so volatile,
the linkage created by index arbitrage wrenches stock prices around
without regard to their real values.
   Moreover, the critics contend, the measly volumes of trading in
the post-crash market exaggerate the influence of this type of
trading and further discourage the genuine, long-term investing
central to the market's health.
   For example, some critics accuse program traders of manipulating
the market by pushing down index-futures prices to incite selloffs
in stock prices, then purchasing the stocks for less than they had
sold them earlier.
   Program traders also have been accused of a practice called
``front-running,'' in which they supposedly take profitable
positions in one market based on what they know will happen in
another market as a result of their computerized strategies.
   None of the questions about the effects of program trading were
settled by the statistics in the NYSE report, which provided no
analysis of their possible significance.
   Big Board spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin declined to comment on the
meaning or value of the numbers, saying they were meant to speak
for themselves. But she also said that in future monthly reports,
more statistics might be added.
   Since February, the exchange has enforced a temporary restraint
on program trading triggered when the Dow Jones industrial average
swings more than 50 points from the previous day's close, but the
effect of this so-called ``collar'' is debatable.
   Last month, the NYSE also proposed other restraints on program
trading in conjunction with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where
key stock-index futures contracts are traded. Those restraints,
which would replace the collar, include coordinated trading halts
if the Dow average drops 250 points in a day.

   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Government reports on the economy intensified worries about
inflation and rising interest rates. The Labor Department said
grocery prices jumped 1.4 percent in July, the biggest monthly
increase in more than four years; the Commerce Department said the
economy grew at a strong 3.3 percent pace in the April-June quarter
and inflation hit a six-year peak of 5.1 percent.
   _On the other hand, some statistics suggested the economy
remains relatively healthy and may even be slowing down. The
Commerce Department said orders for durable goods fell 7 percent in
July, the biggest drop in four years; the trade deficit shrank by
14.9 percent from April through June, helped by record-high exports
and the first quarterly decline in imports in three years; and the
growth personal income and spending in July remained modest.
   _Interest rates rose abroad, pushed higher by European central
banks concerned about the recently strengthened dollar's effect on
their own economies. The increases presented further evidence of a
trend in higher interest rates worldwide.
   _The rising cost of credit in this country was responsible for a
5 percent drop in sales of existing single-family homes last month,
the National Association of Realtors said. Rising mortgage rates
priced many would-be homebuyers out of the market.
   _Leveraged buyouts, in which the assets and earnings of target
companies are used to finance their acquisition, were back in the
news in a big way. Retailing giant Wickes Cos. agreed to a $598
million leveraged buyout by its management; Lear Siegler Seating
Corp.'s management agreed to buy the company for $500 million from
leveraged buyout specialist Forstmann Little & Co.; Dealmaker
Donald Kelly, who led a $6.1 billion leveraged buyout of Beatrice
Cos., announced his resignation as chairman from the food
conglomerate.
   _Elsewhere in takeovers and acquisitions, Farmers Insurance
Group Inc. of Los Angeles agreed to a $5.2 billion cash takeover by
Batus Inc., ending a bitter eight-month takeover battle with the
British tobacco and retailing giant; Interco Inc. sued the Rales
brothers, accusing them of violating securities laws in their $2.7
billion bid for the retailing concern; and Insilco Corp. accepted a
$1.1 billion offer from two Texas oilmen, shunning a previous
takeover agreement with a management-led group.
   _President Reagan signed a massive trade bill, calling it a step
toward giving American manufacturers fairer access to worldwide
markets. But some major U.S. trading parters expressed regret,
calling the measure protectionist.
   _Despite the drought, the value of U.S. agricultural exports is
expected to jump 22 percent to a four-year high of $34 billion this
fiscal year, up from $27.9 billion in 1986-87, the Agriculture
Department said.
   _Defense contractor TRW Inc. paid a $3 million penalty after
pleading guilty to three counts of conspiring to overcharge the
federal government for military aircraft and M-1 tank parts.
   _A trial began for former carpet-cleaning ``whiz kid'' Barry
Minkow on charges he fabricated building renovation deals to
defraud investors in his ZZZZ Best Co.
   _A federal judge extended an earlier action to bar Eastern
Airlines from firing 4,000 workers and said he would detail his
objections to the company's reorganization and cutback plans in the
coming week.

<HEAD>Stock Volume Choked By Late Summer Rate Worries</HEAD>

   After the October crash, did anyone seriously
expect Wall Streeters to do some frantic celebrating on the first
anniversary of the market's August 1987 peak?
   They did not. Investors marked the occasion by giving the market
the cold shoulder. Daily trading volume on the New York Stock
Exchange tumbled this past week to its lowest average for any week
in about 20 months.
   Traders and analysts who stayed around during the week to answer
the telephone blamed the slowdown on a combination of summer
doldrums, persistent worries about inflation and the economy, and
uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will push interest
rates higher.
   Rates available on fixed-income investments such as Treasury
issues are already offering wary investors a tempting return with
little risk.
   Yields on one-year Treasury bills, for instance, were more than
8.2 percent last week and five-year Treasury notes offered more
than 9 percent.
   On top of that, some market analysts say investors' skepticism
about stocks, sharpened by the frantic price collapse last October
that followed so closely after the market's August highs, remains
keen.
   They said the periodic and often unexpected bouts of
computer-driven program trading that still send the market through
some scary turns and the sour taste left by government
investigations of insider trading are also keeping the investors
out of the market.
   Investors got a reminder about program trading this past week
when the NYSE issued its first monthly measurement of the the
volume involved in the technique, saying it accounted for 10.1
percent of shares traded in July.
   ``You have an extremely high level of fear and apathy on the
part of investors generally,'' said Dean A. Gulis, director of
research for the brokerage firm Roney & Co. in Detroit. ``The
volume numbers are telling you more than anything you need to look
at.''
   Jack Garry, manager of institutional trading at Butcher & Singer
Inc. in Philadelphia, said, ``No one is really ready to make a
commitment to stocks.''
   ``We have some people nibbling at prices, sometimes adding to
existing positions, but there is just no real reason people can
find over the past few weeks to jump in and become buyers,'' he
said.
   That type of environment is especially troublesome in the late
summer when many traders and their clients are trying to take a
break from normal routines.
   In past years, traders often stayed on the job when the market
was busy. But Garry said this year's inactivity means ``nobody is
canceling their vacation plans. Not many people have reasons to
stick around.''
   The reduced interest in trading stocks ironically occurred on
the first anniversary of one of Wall Street's headiest days. The
Dow Jones industrial average reached its all-time peak of 2,722.42
on Aug. 25, 1987.
   This past week, the Dow Jones swung widely before finishing at
2,017.43, up 1.43 from its close a week ago.
   For the week, the NYSE composite index slipped 0.30 to 147.24;
the American Stock Exhange market-value index lost 1.16 to 293.87
and the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
2.99 to 374.43.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 117.29 million shares a day,
against 144.61 million shares the week before.
   That was the lowest for any week since volume averaged 114.25
million shares a day the week ended Jan. 2, 1987, which included
the New Years holiday.
   For some Wall Streeters, low volume could soon take on a
personal dimension. Traders are worried that if volume fails to
pick up after the Labor Day holiday, brokerage houses may lay off
employees.
   Perrin Long, who follows the brokerage business for Lipper
Analytical Securities Corp., said they may have genuine cause for
concern.
   ``I think there will be more layoffs, coming probably around the
15th of October,'' he said. ``Most firms will have good handle on
what third-quarter profits were by that time.''
   Long said brokerage executives ``can't put their fingers on what
has to happen to get individual and institutional investors more
interested.''
   Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research for the
brokerage Gruntal Financial Inc. in New York, said he disagress
with market watchers who feel low volume is a sign stocks may be
headed lower.
   ``I think the selling has pretty much taken place,'' he said.
   But he attaches one cautionary note to his optimistic view _
that the Fed refrains from giving ``another jerk on the reins'' by
tightening credit.

<HEAD>Bond Market Gets One-Two Punch from GNP, European Rate Hikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bond market, already battered by recent
hikes in U.S. interest rates, is reeling from a new one-two punch.
   The new blows came on Thursday, when the Commerce Department
released a report on the gross national product for the second
quarter and several central banks in Europe raised key interest
rates.
   The punches knocked the wind out of bond prices, sending
interest rates higher. The Treasury's closely watched 30-year issue
slumped 17-32 point, or about $5.30 for every $1,000 in face value.
Its yield, often an indicator of interest rate trends, rose to 9.45
percent from 9.40 percent late Wednesday.
   ``There's no doubt that both elements were negative,'' said
William Sullivan, director of money-market research at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., referring to the GNP report and the European rate
hikes.
   The GNP data showed that the U.S. economy expanded at a robust
annual rate of 3.3 percent from April through June despite the
severe impact of the drought on farm production. That was up from
an earlier estimate of 3.1 percent.
   But what really hurt bond prices in the report was a GNP price
index indicating that inflation accelerated. The index rose at an
annual rate of 5.1 percent during the second quarter, the sharpest
increase since a 5.8 percent rise in the third quarter of 1982.
   The GNP figures indicated ``that the economy is expanding much
too rapidly and inflation will become more of a problem later on,''
said Marshall Front, an economist for Stein Roe & Farnham, an
investment firm in Chicago.
   Evidence of accelerating inflation raises fear that the Federal
Reserve could put the brakes on the economy by tightening credit
and forcing interest rates higher.
   That's what the Fed did in a dramatic move on Aug. 9, announcing
a half-percentage point increase in its discount rate to combat
inflation. That put the fee the Fed charges member banks for
short-term loans at 6.5 percent, its highest level in more than two
years.
   It was the first rise in the key rate since September 1987 _ the
month preceding the stock market crash _ and sparked a half-point
increase in the U.S. prime lending rate to 10 percent.
   The ripples sent out by the Fed's discount-rate hike turned into
waves this past Thursday, when the central banks of West Germany
and Britain raised key interest rates. The moves were quickly
matched by France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Austria.
   West Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said it raised its
discount rate in order to stem the dollar's rise against the mark.
British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the base
lending rate was boosted to keep domestic inflation under control.
   The coordinated European actions, viewed as a ``catch-up'' to
the rise in the U.S. discount rate, rekindled fears of a world
interest-rate spiral and dealt another body blow to bond prices.
   ``It reminded people that the course of global rates may still
be in an upward direction,'' said Dean Witter's Sullivan.
   The double whammy came when the bond market was just recovering
from its pummeling two weeks earlier by the discount-rate increase.
The unexpected rate boost wreaked havoc on the three quarterly
auctions of Treasury securities that followed the move.
   Now, bond traders are looking ahead anxiously to upcoming
reports on the economy for an indication of what course the Fed
might take. A critical set of data, the report on the nation's
unemployment in August, will arrive on Friday of the coming week.
   Some analysts believe the Fed could push the discount rate still
higher. Other experts, though, think the central bank would be
loathe to take such drastic action again so close to the
presidential election in November. Instead, they expect the central
bank to nudge rates gently higher by using routine operations such
as playing on the federal funds rate, the interest on overnight
loans between banks.

<HEAD>Grain Markets Awaiting Export News As Weather's Influence Fades</HEAD>

weekly commodity price trends.</NOTE>

   At least one grain trader snoozed through the noon hour while
most of his colleagues chatted along the sidelines in a scene that
could hardly have been imagined just six weeks ago at the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   The great drought rally of 1988 is history, just a big blip on a
long chart. The small-time speculators whose money fueled the
mid-summer run-up have gone home to count their winnings or nurse
their lumps, and seasoned players in the crop futures markets are
looking ahead to the next wave _ the harvest trough and the demand
surge.
   ``The weather market ended three or four weeks ago,'' said
Gerald Zusel, a vice president of Balfour Maclaine Corp. and
manager of the brokerage firm's activities on the CBOT grain floor.
   ``The weather is certainly a lot less important now than it was
then,'' agreed Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. ``The focus is shifting more and more to demand.''
   Zusel said Balfour's grain and soybean trading volume has fallen
20 percent to 30 percent since late June-early July, when prices
peaked, then plunged following a weekend of unexpected rain.
   ``We had a tremendous speculative exit with the ending of the
drought segment of the market,'' he said. ``The market has become
much thinner.''
   The change in the markets was readily apparent during a visit to
the floor this past Thursday. The soybean futures pit, the eye of
this summer's speculative storm, was jammed and boisterous at the
opening and close but held less than 20 traders at mid-session.
   Exchange statistics show the average daily trading volume in
soybean futures during the first three weeks of August has fallen
36 percent since the same period in June while corn volume has
dropped by 28 percent.
   Prices for near-month delivery of soybeans and corn _ the two
major markets most affected by the drought _ have also fallen
dramatically. September soybeans closed Friday at $8.31{ a bushel,
down 24 percent from the June 23 peak of $10.99{; September corn
finished the week at $2.77\ a bushel, off 21 percent from the July
5 high of $3.52{.
   ``The break was almost as vicious as the rally,'' said Michael
O'Malley, a trader with R.J. O'Brien & Associates, a Chicago-based
commodity brokerage house specializing in retail accounts. ``A lot
of late-comers who bought the market lost money on the break and
when people lose money, they have a tendency to stay on the
sidelines for a while.''
   With the corn harvest already begun in the South, corn and
soybean traders are anticipating a seasonal dip in prices linked to
the gathering of new supplies - ``harvest pressure,'' they call it.
The phenomenon is expected despite estimates that corn and soybean
production will decline 37 percent and 23 percent, respectively,
from last year's levels.
   After the harvest, demand typically becomes the prime influence
in the grain markets.
   The wheat market has been firming lately on expectations of
increased foreign demand and some experts believe wheat futures
prices are primed for a dramatic surge. Wheat for September
delivery in Chicago settled at $3.90 a bushel on Friday, 31 cents
below the contract's lifetime high.
   ``The wheat market is about to blow up,'' said Gordon D. Linn,
president of Chicago-based Linnco Futures Inc.
   Linn, citing declining U.S. wheat stockpiles and reduced wheat
production this year in the United States, Canada and Argentina,
predicted a 15 percent jump in wheat futures prices in the near
future.

   Here are some commodity price trends during the past week:
   Grain and soybean futures retreated on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Wheat for September delivery settled Friday at $3.90 a bushel
compared with $3.91} a week earlier; September corn dropped to
$2.77\ a bushel from $2.87\; September oats fell to $2.54 a bushel
from $2.59; and September soybeans slid to $8.31{ a bushel from
$8.71.
   Cattle futures advanced while pork futures were mixed on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   October live cattle rose to 72.97 cents a pound from 71.87
cents; September feeder cattle moved to 82.25 cents a pound from
81.47 cents; October hogs fell to 41.05 cents a pound from 41.45
cents; and February frozen pork bellies climbed to 54.82 cents a
pound from 54.17 cents.
   Precious metals futures were nearly unchanged on the Commodity
Exchange in New York.
   October gold was unchanged at $435.60 a troy ounce; September
silver fell 1 cent to $6.66 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures retreated on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   October West Texas Intermediate crude oil dipped to $15.34 a
barrel from $15.85; September heating oil dropped to 42.67 cents a
gallon from 44.48 cents; and September unleaded gasoline fell to
46.79 cents a gallon from 47.59.

   Oil futures prices have bounced back from a
steep slide but the market's underlying sentiment remains bearish.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for October
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, edged up 3 cents a barrel Friday to close at $15.34.
Most other contract months were unchanged.
   The October crude contract fell 37 cents a barrel in Thursday's
trading.
   Prices of refined oil products traded on the exchange also rose.
Contracts for September delivery of wholesale unleaded gasoline
rose 0.35 cent to finish at 46.79 cents a gallon. Wholesale heating
oil for September advanced 0.22 cent to 42.67 cents a gallon.
   On Thursday, oil futures tumbled sharply on reports that oil
production by the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries had surged anew.
   The oil futures market has been inactive in recent weeks without
news on supply and demand to guide it. Analysts said Thursday's
reports on OPEC provided the first sign of direction in some time,
with prices likely to weaken further as the increased oil outflow
reaches consuming nations.
   Friday's recovery did not signal a change in market sentiment,
analysts said, but was mainly due to buying late in the session by
traders who wanted to balance their positions before the weekend.
   ``The market is continuing in a bearish trend,'' said Chris
Gohler, an oil futures broker with Elders Futures Inc. ``The market
just has a tendency to spike back very quickly.''
   He also noted gasoline prices are being supported by fairly
tight supplies in the physical market and by some oil refineries
already converting their facilities to prepare for increased
heating oil production for the winter.

   Government economic figures suggested the inflationary threat
isn't as acute as some people fear, but the news wasn't enough to
wake Wall Street, which slumbered through the slowest trading day
of the year.
   The Commerce Department said Friday that Americans' personal
incomes, bolstered by the biggest increase in wages in seven
months, rose 0.6 percent in July while consumer spending slowed
because of a drop in auto sales.
   The increase in incomes was identical to the June advance. But
spending on personal consumption, which includes everything except
interest payments on debt, rose a 0.5 percent in July, less than
half the 1.1 percent June advance.
   As with other recent statistics, economists found signs of
growing inflationary pressures in the report, primarily in a 1
percent gain in wages and salaries, the biggest rise in this key
component since last December.
   But others said the slowdown in spending was an
anti-inflationary sign, because it suggested demand for goods
wasn't overwhelming the ability of factories and stores to supply
them.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in Los Angeles with
President Reagan, called the report ``good news.''
   ``The figures in the report are favorable, with steady income
growth, good growth in consumer spending and an in the personal
saving rate,'' Fitzwater said.
   But there was little reaction on Wall Street, where stocks
gained slightly and volume on the New York Stock Exchange slumped
to 89.24 million shares, the lowest level since an 86.36 million
share day last Nov. 27, the Friday after Thanksgiving. Bond prices
also ended little changed in slack trading.
   ``I just think a lot of people are finding an excuse to take
vacations or an early Labor Day,'' said Lawrence R. Helfand,
manager of retail sales at the Chicago-based investment firm Rodman
& Renshaw Inc. ``There's no question that people are just sitting
on the sidelines.''
