<TEXT>
   Flamboyant restaurateur Peter Langan, unconscious
since being burned in a fire at his home in October, died Wednesday
night, St. Andrews Hospital at Billericay said. He was 47.
   Irish-born Langan, whose Langan's Brasserie in London's West End
was a favorite with show business personalities, co-owned the
restaurant with actor Michael Caine and chef Richard Shepherd. He
also owned a restaurant in Los Angeles.
   Langan was burned when a fire broke out at 4 a.m. on Oct. 21 at
his home at Alphamstone, 50 miles northeast of London, after what
police called a serious domestic incident with his wife, Susan, 46.
   News reports at the time said Mrs. Langan, who broke her ankle
jumping from a balcony, had told Langan she wanted to leave him.
   Shepherd said at the time that an oil heater in a bedroom
accidentally started the blaze. But the British domestic news agency
Press Association said Wednesday that police believe Langan may have
started the fire deliberately after an argument with Mrs. Langan.
   Langan, a former self-confessed hardened drinker, was remembered
at Langan's Brasserie for stunts such as crawling across the floor
and biting customers' ankles and putting out a fire in the kitchen
with vintage champagne.
   ``He was a great character and will be sadly missed,'' said Peter
Malva, the manager of the business.

<TEXT>
   The Moslem half of Lebanon's divided
government feuded Wednesday over a proposal to take control of the
nation's embattled Central Bank and block funds for Christian
military forces.
   Militia head Walid Jumblatt, a Druse Moslem who also heads
several government portfolios, threatened Tuesday to force
replacement of bank management if it transferred money to Christian
units of the Lebanese army, the daily An-Nahar newspaper reported.
   However, an aide to Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who leads the
nation's Moslem Cabinet, quoted Hoss as saying Wednesday that the
bank should be preserved intact for the sake of national unity.
   ``If the Central Bank collapses, the whole country will collapse
with it,'' said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A few hours after Jumblatt's speech, a rocket-propelled grenade
slammed into the Central Bank building in Moslem west Beirut. It
caused severe damage but no casualties, police said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
   Lebanon's Christian leaders also lashed out the bank over the
weekend. A source close to Michael Aoun, leader of the rival
Christian military Cabinet, said bank officials were ``pressured by
pro-Syrian leaders'' to block a fund transfer requested by Aoun. He
was reported to ask for the money to repair jet fighters controlled
by Christian units of the Lebanese army.
   The Central Bank made no comment on the reports.
   Lebanon has been without a head of state since Sept. 23, when the
six-year term of former President Amin Gemayel expired. Sectarian
skirmishing prevented election of a successor.
   Gemayel then appointed Aoun, a Maronite Christian, as prime
minister of an interim Cabinet. But pro-Syrian Moslem leaders
rejected the move and declared sole allegiance to Hoss' existing
Cabinet.
   Rivalry between the two Cabinets has further divided the army and
police along sectarian lines. With about 40,000 troops in Lebanon,
Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon.

   A winding street lined with small houses and
bearing Roy Orbison's name is this town's only monument to the
legendary singer and songwriter who grew up here.
   But the West Texas town of 1,200, where the high school football
stadium is the biggest thing in town and the oil field pumpjacks and
scrub brush stand high on the horizon, provided the musical grist
for the man known for his black garb, wraparound sunglasses and
haunting vocals.
   Orbison, who sang such hits as ``Pretty Woman'' and ``Crying,''
died of a heart attack late Tuesday in Hendersonville, Tenn. He was
52.
   Wink residents remember Orbison as someone whose extraordinary
talent surfaced early.
   In high school, he and some friends formed the Wink Westerners,
which played country and Western music at school dances and later
had a radio and television show sponsored by a furniture store in
nearby Odessa.
   The band, formed when Orbison was a sophomore, made its debut at
a Wink High School assembly and went on to play dance halls and bars
in surrounding towns such as Iraan, Crane and Jal. The group changed
its name to the Teen Kings after its five members graduated and
played a newer kind of music: rock 'n' roll.
   After a trip to Nashville and a national tour, ``They came back
to Wink and all of them were driving Cadillacs,'' said John Paul
Pitts, a former Wink resident who lived one house away from Orbison.
   ``I used to come out of my house and see Roy in the back seat of
his car, practicing the guitar because his house was so small,''
said Pitts, who wore Orbison's sport coat for his high school
graduation because he didn't own one.
   Years before forming the band Orbison played his guitar and sang
outside the local drug store.
   ``People would throw him nickels and quarters,'' said J.L. Dodd,
principal of Wink High School who taught Orbison in two classes.
   Orbison's musical ambition was evidenced in the verse beneath his
senior picture in his 1954 high school yearbook: ``To lead a Western
band - Is his after school wish - And of course to marry -A
beautiful dish.''
   The Orbison family came to the area from Vernon during the oil
boom of the 1940s. Orbison's father, Orvie Lee, worked in the
Permian Basin oil fields but found time to teach his son to play the
guitar at age 6.
   Orbison last visited West Texas for an Oil Aid concert in Midland
last year to benefit economically stricken oilfield workers.
   ``I never thought that success changed him,'' said Bill Beckham,
publisher of The Wink Bulletin and the Winkler County News who
attended high school with Orbison. ``Wink was always home for Roy
even though he had not been there for many years.''
   Last year the town changed the name of Langley Way, where the
singer had lived, to Roy Orbison Drive. The shotgun house his family
occupied is no longer standing.
   Wink officials said Wednesday they were planning a memorial
service for Orbison but details had not been worked out yet.

   Police arrested 15 organizers of a
human rights march banned by the government of President Gen.
Alfredo Stroessner, church radio reported Wednesday.
   The ``March for Life,'' set for Saturday, is to commemorate the
40th anniversary of the United Nation's Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. Organizers declared it will take place despite the
arrests.
   ``We have persuasive means to stop the march, and I can assure
you it will not take place,'' Interior Minister Sabino Montanaro
said.
   But co-organizer Miguel Abdoon Saguier said: ``On Dec. 10, we
will be in the streets, and if the government represses us and beats
us, these violations will be used as proof against it before the
United Nations Committee on Human Rights and the Organization of
American States.''
   The Interior Ministry issued a statement Tuesday saying the
government opposes the march on the grounds that participants
include ``known agitators who are seeking to disturb the peace of
the country.''
   Domingo Laino, leader of the Authentic Liberal Radical Party and
perhaps this South American nation's most well-known critic of the
government, was arrested Tuesday night, the Roman Catholic Church's
Radio Caritas reported.
   Also arrested were Fernando Vera, president of the Febrerista
Revolutionary Party; Ligia Prieto, president of the Paraguayan
Women's Union; Elsa Mereles, a leader of the nurses union at the
National Clinical Hospital, and three leaders of the Committee of
Churches, which represents Catholics and Protestants.
   Demonstrators intend to march seven blocks from the national
cathedral to the offices of the United Nations in downtown Asuncion.
   The march was organized by a group called the National
Convergence for Human Rights, comprised of opposition political
parties and unions.
   Stroessner, 75, seized power in 1954 and has ruled since with the
support of the army and the Colorado party.

   A burst water main flooded 20 houses and
caused at least $1 million damage in this Boston suburb days after a
work crew decided the leaky main could wait for repair, authorities
said.
   ``It was a gusher. If it had been oil, we would be rich,'' Mayor
Theodore Mann said Tuesday, hours after the deluge.
   A leak in the 48-inch main was reported Saturday, said Paul
DiNatale, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Water Resources
Authority. A crew was dispatched but decided the problem could wait
until Tuesday for repair, he said.
   `We're all angry that the judgment wasn't a better call,'' the
mayor said. ``But anger isn't going to get it repaired. We want to
prevent this from happening again.''
   The flood forced 38 people to find shelter elsewhere and was
expected to close a main street for at least 10 days, authorities
said.

   Ms. Cardillo said a bacterium was detected during blood tests,
but doctors were not overly concerned.
   ``She's responding very favorably,'' the spokeswoman said
Tuesday. ``Today has been one of her best days.''
   Rolandrea, who's known as Rolly, received a new liver, pancreas,

   An oil shale mine in northeastern
Estonia has been ablaze for more than a month and authorities
believe it will take another week to extinguish, a newspaper
reported.
   Kodumaa, a newspaper published in Tallinn, the Estonian capital,
said Tuesday that 500 miners had to be rescued and no injuries were
reported when the fire broke out Nov. 3 at the Estonia Mine near the
town of Kohtla-Jarve in this tiny republic on the Baltic Sea.
   Firefighters sealed sections of the mine with concrete and then
poured in 21 million gallons of water to contain the blaze, whose
origin was unknown. Two explosions have rocked the huge mine since
the fire started.
   Some 200 firefighters and 200 miners have been fighting the fire,
the newspaper reported.
   Estonian environmentalists have complained the mine is ruining
the area, and the water used to put out the fire has become
contaminated with phenol, a poisonous substance formed by burning
shale.
   Two weeks after the fire started, Kodumaa said, the phenol
content in nearby rivers exceeded safe levels by several thousand
times. Authorities are considering building several huge reservoirs
to store the contaminated water when it is pumped out of the mine.

   Secular Israelis are organizing to stop a
campaign by the ultra-Orthodox to close all forms of entertainment,
from soccer stadiums to cafes, on the Jewish sabbath.
   Secular Jews find the prospect even more offensive because few
ultra-Orthodox do army service in a nation that fights to survive
and has experienced four wars in its 40 years.
   Some of the alarm appears exaggerated, but many Israelis feel
political success by the religious fundamentalists could alter the
character of the Jewish state, discouraging immigration and even
provoking a flight of talented people.
   About 70 percent of Israel's 3.5 million Jews are non-observant.
Despite that majority, they were passive in past years when the
Orthodox obtained such concessions as stopping the national airline
El Al from flying on the sabbath _ sundown Friday to sundown
Saturday.
   Demands by four small religious parties with the balance of power
in the parliament elected Nov. 1, however, have have prompted the
first large-scale organization of secular Jews.
   One group is Hemdat, a privately financed association formed to
safeguard scientific, cultural and religious freedoms.
   It formed an emergency committee called Freedom to organize
feminists, non-Orthodox rabbis, army officers and scholars against
religious legislation proposed by the ultra-Orthodox.
   ``The Orthodox may be strong in the parliament, but out in the
street they are weak,'' said Zamira Segev, a Hemdat coordinator.
``The moment we organize and we are insistent, we will win.''
   Many feel religious coercion contradicts the vision of Israel's
socialist pioneers, who sought freedom from religious strictures as
well as national liberation.
   One rallying point of the secular is fear that laws closing
stadiums, theaters, restaurants, bars and other public places on the
sabbath would encourage emigration.
   ``After the elections, a lot of people said, `That's it, I'm
leaving,''' Segev said. ``I can't believe people will actually go,
but it's a burning subject.''
   Educators say the ultra-Orthodox might divert government funds
from universities, forcing scholars to seek opportunities abroad.
   ``The ultra-Orthodox consider the universities to be hotbeds of
secularism and would love to cut them down,'' said Lee Levine, an
archaeology professor at Hebrew University.
   Exemption of the ultra-Orthodox from army service creates strong
feeling.
   Other Israeli men do three years of compulsory service followed
by up to 62 days a year of reserve duty, but ultra-Orthodox students
often defer service until age 26. After that, they either do not
serve at all or are not required to do the full three years.
   About 10,000 people rallied in Kings of Israel Square in Tel Aviv
last month to protest such deferments, which have totaled about
19,000 in 1988.
   ``I don't understand why I had to fight and lose my legs, and
lose my friends, while someone sits in school and prays,'' a veteran
identified only as Maoziya told the applauding protesters.
   He lost both legs, an arm and an eye during the three-year
invasion and occupation of Lebanon that ended in June 1985. Maoziya
said he still was doing reserve duty and so could the ultra-Orthodox.
   Judaism's more liberal Reform and Conservative movements are
active in the effort to stop religious laws.
   ``As a Conservative rabbi, I am not in favor of operating cinemas
and ruining the nature of the sabbath, but I feel the Jewish
religion can compete on the open market of ideas,'' said Rabbi
Philip Spectre, chairman of the Freedom committee. ``It does not
have to be enforced by legislation.''
   The Orthodox establishment has a monopoly on Israel's religious
affairs. It has barred liberal rabbis from performing marriages or
burials and made the liberal movements ineligible for state
education funds.
   Four religious political parties won 18 seats in the 120-member
Knesset on Nov. 1, enough to force concessions from Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir if he includes them in a right-wing coalition.
   Topping the Orthodox agenda is a law recognizing only conversions
to Judaism performed by Orthodox rabbis.
   Among people who would not longer be considered Jewish under such
a statute is David Codding, a British-born immigrant who has lived
in Israel for 17 years, served in a combat army unit and raised a
family here. He was converted to Judaism by a non-Orthodox rabbi.
   ``The implications of that law mean that if, God forbid, I were
killed in the service of this country I would not be interred in
consecrated ground,'' Codding wrote in a letter to the Jerusalem
Post newspaper.
   Targets for the ultra-Orthodox are less lofty but would have
greater inmmediate effect. They want to reverse the victory secular
Jews won in persuading some Jerusalem theaters to show movies on
Friday nights.
   Some religious parties also favor making rulings of the
rabbinical courts immune to reversal by the Supreme Court. Critics
say that would enable rabbis to annul foreign marriages and
divorces, creating a maze of bigamy, unresolved divorce settlements
and child custody disputes.
   Ultra-Orthodox leaders say they are trying to preserve the Jewish
nature of Israel, not to coerce the secular.
   ``We don't want to impose on the private life of any person,''
said Rabbi Menachem Porush, a leading member of the ultra-Orthodox
party Augudat Israel.
   Their opponents worry about a hidden agenda and satirists paint
scenes of a country where secular books and mixed bathing are
banned, synagogue attendance is mandatory, married women must shave
their heads in accordance with religious rulings on modesty and
rabbis inspect homes to make sure dietary laws are observed.

<HEAD>Atlantic City Offers Novelists, Filmmakers `Glitter And Sleaze'</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drawn by the bright and dazzling
lights of casinos and the bleak squalor of the urban area beyond the
Boardwalk, filmmakers and novelists are using Atlantic City as a
popular setting for tales of organized crime, drugs, prostitution,
gambling and murder.
   ``An ugly mixture of glitter and sleaze,'' is how novelist Ovid
Demaris sees the city in his upcoming work, ``Ricochet.'' In ``Under
the Boardwalk,'' author Bill Kent's characters are portrayed in a
``universe of dazzle and slime.''
   TV viewers got glimpses of Atlantic City recently with a movie
based on Elmore Leonard's 1985 novel, ``Glitz,'' starring Markie
Post and Jimmy Smits. In his book, Leonard talks about the glittery
casinos thriving on bus tours that ``dropped the suckers off for six
hours to lose their paychecks.''
   He also describes the city's Inlet neighborhood as an area that
``looked as though it had been fought over in a war, house to house,
and half the people had packed up and left.''
   All the attention gets mixed reviews from city fathers who take
pride in the allure of their town but worry that it's being typecast.
   ``We do look like a perfect stage set,'' said John Fox, a
spokesman for the Atlantic City Convention & Visitors Bureau. ``We
have a beautiful stage set along the beachfront with the giant
casinos ... but the rundown neighborhoods also seem to be an easy
target.''
   Mayor James Usry accuses some writers of ``yellow journalism'''
when it concerns Atlantic City. ``But that's what sells papers and
books,'' he said.
   ``I don't know of any Mafia in Atlantic City. You know, these
authors could say it took place in Mayville, Ill., but what would
that mean to people? Atlantic City is one of the most designated
city names in the country.''
   Louis Malle's critically acclaimed movie, ``Atlantic City,''
starring Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon, marked the start of
Atlantic City's revival as a setting for moviedom and novels. That
was nine years ago, barely a year after legalized gambling began.
   Now barely a month passes without Atlantic City featured in some
TV show, movie or book.
   Diane Keaton has shot scenes in one casino for a story about
three nightclub entertainers. The comedy-magic team of Penn & Teller
was in the resort last spring to film ``Penn & Teller Get Killed.''
   ``Atlantic City Weekend: A Romantic Adventure,'' was released
this fall. Characters in the book by Helen Mourtos include an
entrepreneur ``on the outside of society,'' a casino dealer and a
mysterious nightclub dancer.
   Previews described the novel as ``offering insiders a view of
life in the world of Atlantic City's casinos ... about the
temptations beneath the casinos' bright lights.''
   Fox doesn't think the visions of a sleazy Atlantic City have
driven away business or visitors.
   ``I can't throw rocks at the movie writers and novelists because
they happen to choose us as their setting,'' he said. ``I don't
think anybody except a travel writer goes out of their way to write
something positive about any particular city.''
   Fox worries more about how trade publications portray the city.
   ``They prefer to look at the business side of things,'' he said.
``They are more important to us, the marketers.''
   Demaris said it was the lure of gambling, the big hotels and
Atlantic City's history as a resort that enticed him to choose it as
the setting for ``Ricochet,'' a novel that promises to take
``readers straight to the heart of a world of greed, political
corruption, organized crime and murder.''
   Could his novel have worked in another city?
   ``No,'' said Demaris, ``because casino gambling is a part of it.
   ``I needed that atmosphere ... and I needed a kind of Mafia
family like you have down there. In New York, the Mafia has gotten
sort of small, it has kind of quieted down.''
   Kent doesn't think that kind of allure is bad for Atlantic City.
   ``What makes Atlantic City interesting to writers is the
incredible clash of extremes. You can actually see the fortunes of
people going up and down,'' he said. ``The city is far more than
multimillion-dollar casinos and run-down neighborhoods. It's
complicated, politically, economically and mostly historically.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plenty of new shows were broadcast last week, but
a rerun of ``The Cosby Show'' was the No. 1 prime-time program and
helped NBC stretch its run at the top of the A.C. Nielsen Co. rating
to 24 weeks.
   Barbara Walters helped ABC hold second place with a No. 2 rated
special.
   NBC won the week with an average, prime-time rating of 16.0. ABC
had a 13.4; CBS 12.2.
   The top 10 prime-time shows were: ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC; ``The
50th Barbara Walters Special,'' ABC; ``A Different World,'' NBC;
``Cheers,'' NBC; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``60
Minutes,'' CBS; ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC; ``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS
and ``Growing Pains,'' ABC.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' continued to be the season's highest-rated new
show. Next-highest were NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and ``Dear John,''
ranked 12th and 13th, respectively.
   Among new shows, CBS' ``TV 101'' had an inauspicious debut at
63rd, just below ABC's ``Murphy's Law.'' CBS did better with
``Almost Grown,'' which ranked 44th.
   NBC has canceled ``Something Is Out There.'' ``Baby Boom'' and
``Tattinger's'' face problems. They ranked 48th and 60th,
respectively.
   Five of CBS' shows are struggling in the bottom 10.
   The week's lowest-rated shows were: ``West 57th'' tied with ``TV
101,'' ``Dirty Dancing,'' ``Knightwatch,'' ``The Van Dyke Show,''
``Police Story,'' ``Burning Questions: Defense,'' ``Trackdown,''
``Annie McGuire,'' ``Simon & Simon'' and ``Raising Miranda.''
   In the news category, the ``CBS Evening News'' was back on top
with a rating of 11.5. ``ABC World News Tonight'' had an 11.3; ``NBC
Nightly News'' 10.7.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 households with television.

   Here is the text of Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's remarks upon arrival Tuesday at Kennedy International
Airport, as translated from the Russian by Viktor Sukhudreyev of the
Soviet Foreign Ministry:
   
   First of all, I should like, on behalf of the Soviet people, to
extend my greetings to the United Nations and to express my feelings
of profound respect for the American people and for all New Yorkers.
   I feel the program of my stay here, the stay of my delegation,
has taken shape. I think it's an interesting program and I'm
certainly satisfied with it.
   We will be having meetings with the secretary general of the
United Nations, Perez de Cuellar, with the president of this current
session of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Caputo, and I
hope those meetings will be useful. The Soviet Union hopes to
broaden and expand its cooperation within the United Nations
framework, with all the states that make up the United Nations.
   I shall be addressing the United Nations General Assembly
tomorrow. We certainly have what we could say to this most important
forum, this world community. We are living in a world which is going
through some very crucial changes, and all nations have their own
concerns, their own interests. We shall be sharing our concerns and
our interests in analyzing and thinking over the current situation.
   We will have a meeting with United States President Ronald Reagan
and with his successor, George Bush. We have agreed on such a
meeting. I am indeed truly happy to have this new opportunity to
meet with them. I believe that the very fact that this meeting is
going to take place says a great deal, especially in terms of the
active state of Soviet-American relations and discussions. And that
is good. We have not arranged any formal agenda, so either side will
be free, openly and frankly, to raise any questions that it wishes
to.
   I believe that we can safely say even now that the conversations
and the meeting itself will doubtless promote greater dynamism in
the dialogue and an expansion of cooperation between our two
countries. We believe _ and we hope that is the belief of the
American side as well _ that this meeting will serve the best
interests of the United States and the Soviet Union; indeed, of all
the world.
   Within the framework of the program of our visit, we will have
some other meetings with some public and business circles in this
country, with representatives of other countries. I trust these will
be useful and fruitful days. We are certainly prepared to make our
contribution to that end. Thank you.

   President-elect George Bush filled his top two
trade jobs with a close friend and a Ford administration veteran,
and tapped longtime officials William Webster and Thomas Pickering
for positions he once held himself _ CIA director and U.N.
ambassador.
   Bush said Tuesday he has chosen Texas oilman Robert Mosbacher, a
longtime friend and Republican fund raiser, as commerce secretary,
and Washington attorney Carla Hills as U.S. trade representative.
The latter move prompted quick Democratic criticism that Bush had
selected someone without extensive experience in trade.
   Rounding out appointments to his economic team, Bush announced
selection of Stanford University economist Michael Boskin to head
the Council of Economic Advisers. Bush called Boskin ``one of this
nation's preeminent economists.''
   Bush said he was seeking continuity at the CIA when he asked
Webster to stay on at the intelligence agency. President Reagan
named Webster, a former FBI director, to the CIA job last year after
the death of William Casey.
   Pickering, 57, currently is ambassador to Israel. If confirmed by
the Senate, he will replace Vernon Walters as ambassador to the
United Nations.
   Pickering's primary experience is in the Middle East, where he
also was ambassador to Jordan from 1974 to 1978 during President
Jimmy Carter's administration.
   Transition officials said no additional appointments were
expected until Bush returns from New York, where he was accompanying
President Reagan to a meeting today with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   Bush said that his CIA director and U.N. ambassador will not have
Cabinet rank, but that both would attend Cabinet meetings when
pertinent subjects were discussed.
   ``There is no point in the United Nations ambassador sitting
around, as I did for a while, talking about agriculture policy,''
Bush said.
   Bush was U.N. ambassador under President Nixon and was CIA
director during the Ford administration.
   Bush's choice for trade representative, Hills, also served in the
Ford administration, as secretary of housing and urban development.
   The 54-year-old Hills is the first woman Bush has tapped for a
high-level post, but the choice drew immediate criticism from Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, this year's Democratic vice presidential
candidate.
   He called Hill's ``a very able person,'' but criticized Bush's
selection of a trade representative with little background in the
field.
   Bentsen said that while Hills probably will be confirmed by the
Senate, ``I had hoped, frankly, that we'd have someone from the
business world who had extensive international experience in trade.
That didn't happen.''
   The two trade jobs will be highly visibly with the federal trade
deficit totaling $170 billion last year and running at an annual
rate of $137 billion this year.
   Mosbacher, 61, is a longtime friend of Bush's who headed his
primary campaign fund-raising operation. He also was chairman of a
Republican Party program that raised $24 million in $100,000
contributions for the general election campaign.
   Mosbacher, worth an estimated $200 million from his oil and gas
holdings and investments, is a former chairman of the National
Petroleum Council.
   The commerce secretary enforces trade policy and seeks more
markets for U.S. goods, as well as serving as a voice for U.S.
business within the government. Mosbacher also will oversee agencies
ranging from the National Weather Service to the Census Bureau to
the National Bureau of Standards.
   The trade representative negotiates trade agreements with other
countries and investigates complaints of unfair trade practices.
   Bush had lunch Tuesday with Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, Democratic
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Afterward,
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said Bush was ``very firm in the fact that he
did not want to discuss the increasing of revenue'' to combat the
federal deficit.
   Bush also met Tuesday with former Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, whose name had been circulated as a potential U.N.
ambassador. A Bush aide said no promises were made to her regarding
administration jobs.

   A fatal type of skin cancer is affecting more
people at a younger age than ever before, and the trend may get
worse if chemical pollution continues to leach natural ozone from
the atmosphere, an expert says.
   Dr. Darrell S. Rigel, an assistant clinical professor of
dermatology at New York University Medical School, said Tuesday that
melanoma, a type of skin cancer that can be fatal if not treated, is
now diagnosed at the rate of one of 128 Americans, an increase of
about 1,500 percent compared to 1935.
   Even more disturbing, the ages of patients developing melanoma is
dropping dramatically, Rigel told the American Academy of
Dermatology annual meeting.
   ``Five years ago it was unusual to see someone under the age of
40 with skin cancer,'' said Rigel. ``Now we're commonly seeing
people in their 20s with skin cancer.''
   About 25 percent of the estimated 27,300 Americans diagnosed as
having melanoma this year will be aged 39 or under, he said. Only a
few years ago, melanoma was conidered a disease of the aged, Rigel
said.
   ``Not only has the overall rate grown, but the age group where it
has grown the most rapidly is in the youngest group,'' said Rigel.
``The rate of increase is highest among the youngest people, not
only here, but in other countries.''
   It's generally believed that melanoma, a skin cancer that will
spread throughout the body if not excised by surgery early, develops
after 10 to 20 years of heavy or damaging exposure to ultraviolet
rays of the sun. But Rigel said the increasing rate of the disease
among the young suggests that the time it takes to develop the
disease may be decreasing.
   A loss of ozone in atmosphere ``might be the explanation of why
people are getting it younger and younger _ maybe. That has been
brought up as a hyposthesis,'' said Rigel. ``For every decrease of 1
percent in the ozone layer, there is a 2 percent increase in the
incidence of skin cancer.''
   Ozone is a natural gas present in the atmosphere that partially
blocks ultraviolet solar rays from reaching the Earth's surface.
Studies in recent years have shown that some types of chemical
pollutants, principally the fluorocarbons that are used for
refrigerants and solvents, destroy the atmospheric ozone, thus
allowing more ultraviolet rays to reach Earth.
   Counterbalancing the ozone-loss effect, said Rigel, is a growing
consciousness about the dangers of excessive exposure to the sun. He
said more people are using solar screens, a lotion that is applied
to the skin to filter out ultraviolet sun rays.
   ``People are so much more sun conscious than they were just five
years ago,'' he said in an interview. ``The use of sun screen has
risen very dramatically.''
   Many parents have become aware that sun damage on the skins of
children under the age of 10 can result in cancer among those
youngsters before they are 30, said Rigel. As a result, he said,
even children now are using sun screen.
   ``We won't begin to see the effects of that sun screen usage for
another 10 to 20 years from now,'' he said. ``The hope is that by
the turn of the century, the sun screen use and more common sense
about avoiding the sun will kick in'' and cause a decline in skin
cancers.
   If not, said Rigel, he predicts that by the year 2000, melanoma
may be striking one in every 90 Americans.
   Melanoma first appears as a black, brown or mixed colored spot of
irregular shape on the skin's surface. Left untreated, the cancer
penetrates to the interior of the skin and releases cells that can
move through the bloodstream and establish colonies in the bone,
brain, lung or even heart. Once this happens, the disease cannot be
cured, said Rigel.
   But if the cancer is detected early, when it is still about the
size of a pencil eraser, it can easily be cut from the skin and cure
is almost certain, he said.
   Rigel said the number of melanoma cases in the United States has
almost doubled during the last eight years, and the number of deaths
has tripled, to about 5,800, since 1960. Yet, the survival rate for
melanoma patients has risen from 60 percent in the 1960s, to about
83 percent now.

   After the crowds, noise and confusion of the
Liberty Weekend extravaganza two years ago, residents of Governors
Island consoled themselves with one thought: Nothing like it would
happen again.
   They were wrong. In the words of Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Paul
Milligan, ``The two major individuals in the world are coming here
to have lunch.''
   On Tuesday, the small island in New York Harbor, which is
administered by the Coast Guard and used for a base, was abustle
with preparations for the arrival today of Mikhail Gorbachev, Ronald
Reagan and George Bush.
   Even though it sits in the nation's busiest harbor and is just a
brief ferry ride from Manhattan, Governors Island is a quiet town,
barred to the public except for one day in the spring and one in the
fall when visitors are allowed to tour. The speed limit on the
island's roads _ 15 mph _ pretty much typifies the pace of life
enjoyed by its 4,000 residents, all of them connected to the Coast
Guard base.
   The 173-acre island was the epicenter of the four-day Statue of
Liberty relighting celebration in 1986. Some island residents who
survived that experienced an unwanted sense of deja vu this week.
   ``It took people a month to recover from the Statue of Liberty,''
recalled Henry Apicos, principal of the island's elementary school.
``The island was turned into a carnival. People felt imposed upon.''
   This time, restrictions necessitated by the visit ``are going to
create difficulties for some families,'' he said.
   On Sunday night, a four-page notice was handed out to residents
to inform them that for much of today there would be no driving on
the island and no ferry service. Hours at the Coast Guard mess hall
were changed, school was called off, and the Greg Smith Singers'
performance at St. Cornelius Chapel was canceled.
   Residents of ``high security areas'' have been told to leave
their homes or stay inside all afternoon. They can look out the
windows, but may not open them, ``peek from behind drawn shades'' or
stand on their porches.
   Although areas were set aside for islanders to view the leaders,
they had to arrive early, stay late, and bring identification.
``Mostly they'll see a lot of police and security people,'' Apicos
predicted.
   On Tuesday, ``No Parking Wednesday'' signs popped up around the
island, and parked cars were towed from along the motorcade route.
Outside the base's gymnasium, which was being converted into a giant
press room for 800 reporters, a flatbed truck deposited portable
toilets to replace bathrooms that had been converted into
photographers' darkrooms.
   Six Coast Guard men raked leaves in front of an apartment
building, grousing. ``This is what I went to school for?'' asked one.
   At Liberty Village, a new housing complex built on the spot where
Reagan threw the switch to relight the Statue of Liberty, a woman
and her two children tried to reach their car through a maze of
yellow mesh fence thrown up for security.
   ``This is because Reagan and Gorbachev are coming,'' she
explained. ``We're not usually caged up like this.''
   Coast Guard personnel have been working around the clock to set
up press facilities, install communications lines and construct
bleachers, Milligan said.
   ``Liberty Weekend was bigger than this, but it had a longer
planning period _ we learned about this a week ago,'' he said. ``But
the Coast Guard is good at crisis management, whether it's a
search-and-rescue mission or an oil spill or this.
   ``There's been a little grumbling, but people realize it's only
an inconvenience,'' Milligan said. ``This starts the relationship
between the U.S. and the Soviet Union for the next four years.
   ``We'll all remember this, from the smallest child to the
admiral.''

   From the beginning, they were an odd couple, she a
twice-divorced bouffant blond psychologist and he a married minister
and rising star in the mainstream United Methodist Church.
   Friends described her as flashy and flighty. He was short,
balding, intense and driven, and for awhile their liaison was
unknown.
   In a hushed courtroom Monday, an angry young lawyer struggled to
convince a judge that Walker Railey's obsession with Lucy Papillon
drove him to a bizarre murder scheme that ran amok.
   The lawyer succeeded.
   A state judge ruled that Railey, 41, tried to choke his wife to
death and is liable to her relatives for some $16 million in actual
and punitive damages.
   The twisted drama was muddled by the fact that Railey did not
contest the civil allegations, spurned the court proceedings and
quite possibly may never pay a dime of the judicially ordered
damages.
   Stranger still, he does not face criminal charges. He has fled
Texas and is believed to be living in San Francisco.
   Police and prosecutors can prove that Railey devised a clever but
phony alibi the night his wife was attacked, but have no evidence
linking him to the crime itself.
   Peggy Railey survived but suffered extensive brain damage and has
not been able to communicate. Although her eyes can open and follow
moving objects or people, Doctors say she is in a persistent
vegetative state from which she is not expected to recover.
   Expressing his frustration over the Railey affair, criminal
prosecutor Norm Kinne once declared:
   ``This guy's a liar. He's trying to cover his tracks. He wasn't
where he was at the time he says he was. Now the question is, if he
wasn't there, where was he?
   ``The conclusion that everybody's drawn is that he was home
choking out his wife.
   ``But that doesn't necessarily follow. There's no proof he was at
the scene at the time she was strangled. There's no evidence that he
strangled her or that he knew who strangled her or that he arranged
or participated in any way.''
   Twenty months after the assault on Mrs. Railey, the first public
testimony in the case occured in a majestic old courtroom across the
hall from where Jack Ruby was convicted of killing presidential
assassin Lee Harvey Oswald 25 years ago.
   The symbolic issue was the extent of Railey's financial
liability, but the more compelling issue was Lucy Papillon's love
affair with the ex-minister of the 6,000-member First United
Methodist Church, and what role that romance might have played in
the attack on Mrs. Railey.
   Ms. Papillon, 46, unsmiling but composed, insisted there was no
connection between the two, but plaintiff attorney Bill Arnold
endeavored to show otherwise.
   Here are excerpts from their brittle exchange, including Arnold's
liberal reference to the contents of a sworn deposition taken from
Ms. Papillon last May but never before revealed.
   ``Is it fair to say that from June of 1986 until the attack on
Peggy Railey April 21 of 1987 that you met with Walker Railey at
your home on an average of three times a week?''
   ``Yes.''
   ``Did you have intimate relations regularly on these thrice
weekly meetings?''
   ``Yes.''
   ``Did you and Mr. Railey sometimes drink champagne in the
afternoons when he was at your home?''
   ``Occasionally.''
   ``Did you have intimate relations with Walker Railey one week
before the attack on Peggy Railey?''
   ``Yes.''
   Pressing that issue later, Arnold said:
   ``Approximately four days before the attack on Peggy Railey you
are with him for three or four nights at the Doubletree Inn here in
Dallas while he has sent Peggy and the children to be with her
parents. Is that accurate?''
   She muttered a qualified yes.
   Arnold recalled asking Mrs. Papillon about her intensifying
relaionship with Railey and wondering if she ever considered ``in
the back of your mind that there might be some connection'' with the
attack on Mrs. Railey.
   ``Your answer was `No, not once.' Is that still your answer?''
   ``Yes, it is.''
   Arnold read again from Ms. Papillon's sworn statement:
   ``Railey and his wife did not have an intimate relationship and
Railey did not long for such a relationship before he had me because
he did not know what he did not have.
   ``I never gave Railey an ultimatum about divorce. Mrs. Railey was
not aware of her husband's affair with me.''
   Arnold brought out that Railey had discussed divorcing his wife
to marry her but sought to show that such a scenario would
jeopardize his chances of becoming a bishop.
   ``Another scenario is that Peggy mysteriously dies, killed by a
white supremacist because Railey had spoken against racism, leaving
him with a sympathetic role, free to marry you without loss of
respect and ... free to become a bishop?''
   Ms. Papillon replied with a mumbled affirmative.

   Developers building a group of
stores on part of the Jewish Waldheim Cemetery have upset Jewish
leaders and relatives of some of the dead buried on three sides of
the site.
   ``Imagine a K mart in the center of Arlington National
Cemetery,'' Alan Pearlman said Tuesday. His father and grandparents
are buried in the 80-year-old graveyard in this west Chicago suburb.
   The issue is seen differently by Larry Hochberg, president of
Sportmart, Inc. in suburban Niles, who is building an outlet for his
sporting goods, a men's store and an electronics store at the site
near a busy thoroughfare.
   ``Obviously, we wouldn't want to do anything that was
objectionable or sacrilegious,'' said Hochberg.
   ``I'm very active in all aspects of the Jewish community,'' he
said. ``The last thing we would want (is) to do something to cause
terrible pain.''
   The development replaces a virtual ``dumping ground'' for dirt on
the cemetery grounds, Hochberg said, and with landscaping and a new
cemetery entrance, his stores will not be intrusive.
   That is little consolation to Pearlman, 42, of Palatine, who said
he was shocked and amazed when a workman told him of the project
three weeks ago.
   ``From what I've always understood, this is sacred, consecrated
ground,'' said Pearlman, who is considering moving his relatives'
remains.
   Gertrude Weinstein, president of the Des Plaines Cemetery Corp.
that runs the cemetery, said a dwindling local Jewish population led
sales of burial plots to plummet.
   ``We have enough land there for the next 1,000 years,'' she said.
   And Joseph Spina, village president of North Riverside, said he
thinks the development will be tasteful.
   The shopping area is expected to add $150,000 a year in sales-tax
revenue to the village treasury, officials said.
   In May, two months after the 45-acre cemetery lot was annexed by
North Riverside, the village's planning commission held a rezoning
hearing and decided five acres could be used for the stores.
   Notification of adjacent landowners was required before the
hearing.
   But there was no notification of families of those buried in the
cemetery, apparently because the plots are rented by long-term
lease, Pearlman said.
   That bothers Rabbi Paul Greenman, a past president of the
orthodox Chicago Rabbinical Council.
   ``I want to know why the rabbis weren't consulted on this and why
this thing was sprung on the Jewish community,'' said Greenman,
adding the case would be considered by the council. Greenman said
the council will investigate whether the land for the proposed
shopping center was ever intended for graves and if the development
would harm existing graves.
   Hochberg said he did consult with a rabbi he preferred not to
name, and was assured he would not hurt the site.
   The development will improve drainage and vandalism protection
for parts of the cemetery, he said, noting burial grounds surrounded
by commercial development are not uncommon in Chicago.
   But Larry Gershkowitz of Des Plaines, whose parents are buried in
the cemetery, said that doesn't help.
   ``All I can see is a little old woman going in to see her husband
or her children ... and finding a shopping center,'' Gershkowitz
said. ``This is absolutely rediculous.''

<HEAD>More Beef Price Rises Forecast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may be another year before the U.S. cattle
herd begins expanding and eventually taking the edge off rising
consumer beef prices, according to Agriculture Department analysts.
   Meanwhile, consumers will see relatively large supplies of
poultry and pork in the coming year.
   Beef production in 1989 is expected to decline 7 percent to a
nine-year low, says Steve Reed of the department's Economic Research
Service.
   Reed told USDA's annual outlook conference last week that U.S.
economic growth is expected to continue in 1989 at only a ``slightly
slower'' pace than this year. Consumer incomes are expected to keep
rising in real terms, with high employment rates, he said.
   ``Both these factors should provide continued support for meat
prices,'' he said. ``The risk of renewed inflation remains a
concern. However, the rate of inflation ... is expected to rise only
slightly above 1988's 3.3 percent, to perhaps 4 percent.''
   Reed said the Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates
above 1988 levels to help dampen inflation and to attract foreign
investments into the United States.
   ``It will be important that this favorable economic environment
be maintained if expected increases in retail beef prices are going
to be met by little consumer resistance,'' he said. ``The record
retail beef prices during the summer and fall of 1988 likely will be
broken by new record price levels in 1989.''
   Meanwhile, he said, the nation's cattle inventory could edge
still lower by Jan. 1, 1989, from the 99 million head reported at
the start of this year, the fewest since 97.7 million were counted
in 1961.
   But department experts say the heat and drought of 1988 had
little direct effect on the cattle numbers, other than driving up
feed costs and forcing some producers to sell off or trim herds.
   Massive liquidation of cattle herds did not occur, however,
despite pessimistic reports at the height of the drought last
summer. Tens of thousands of cattle were sold, but breeding stock
often was bought by other producers.
   A final report to President Reagan on the drought's impact is
being readied for the White House later this month. It is expected
to confirm what USDA and trade analysts have been saying for months,
that only a small percentage of the nation's cattle fell victim to
heat and drought.
   Reed said a midyear cattle inventory estimated the 1988 calf crop
to be slightly larger than a year ago. Even so, the 1988 and 1987
calf crops are the smallest since 1961.
   The July 1 inventory report showed that heifers calving and
entering breeding herds in the first half of this year jumped 10
percent from a year earlier, suggesting that an expansion may be in
the works.
   But Reed said a similar restocking rate occurred in 1986 and sent
``a false signal to the industry'' that the plunge in the cattle
industry had bottomed out and was starting back up.
   ``This past summer's drought was well under way as the breeding
season began and will likely stall expansion for one more year,'' he
added.
   Drought appears to have had a greater impact on dairy producers,
who responded to rising feed costs by cutting herd sizes, Reed said.
   ``Cattle inventories on Jan. 1, 1989, still are expected to
remain below 100 million head, possibly falling below this year's 99
million head,'' he said.
   Another important factor for livestock producers will be grain
production prospects in 1989 and how those bear upon feed and other
costs in the coming year.
   Ewen M. Wilson, USDA's assistant secretary for economics, said
the 1988 drought without question was ``the most pervasive early
season drought ever to hit the Farm Belt during the critical growing
months.'' Total grain production was cut 29 percent, including a
one-third reduction in this year's corn crop.
   But Wilson reminded the conference that while ``underlying
fundamentals may have been masked'' they may not have been changed
by the 1988 drought and the sharp draw-down in world grain supplies
and higher commodity prices.
   ``The drought has altered the immediate outlook, but in a world
of subsidized agriculture, the long-term tendency to overproduction
lurks only slightly below the surface.''
   It would be a mistake, he said, to ignore long-term fundamentals.
   ``Barring another drought, the odds are in favor of a rebound in
production and a rebuilding of stocks,'' Wilson said.

<HEAD>Mine Owners Relieved by Supreme Court Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coal mine owners are generally pleased with a
Supreme Court ruling shielding them and their insurance companies
from paying up to $13.6 billion in additional black lung benefits
but an attorney for miners claimed a partial victory.
   The justices ruled 9-0 on Tuesday that a group of miners
estimated to number between 94,000 and 155,000 is ineligible to seek
disability benefits for the disease. The group consists of those who
missed deadlines for filing court appeals after they were denied
benefits.
   Mark Solomons, a lawyer representing the mine operators, said,
``The industry is going to be pleased.''
   But Solomons said a second part of the Supreme Court's ruling
will spur additional litigation for a smaller number of miners
hoping to receive benefits.
   In that section, the justices voted 5-4 to permit some miners who
worked less than 10 years in the mines to seek disability pay for
black lung disease, or pneumoconiosis, a respiratory ailment caused
by prolonged inhaling of coal dust.
   Between 8,000 and 10,000 miners with pending claims could be in
line to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits under
that part of the high court decision.
   The court said even if miners have less than 10 years on the job,
they are presumed to be eligible for benefits if they display
medical evidence of the disease.
   Paul Smith, a lawyer representing miners, said the ruling is a
significant _ if only partial _ victory for the workers.
   ``The presumption makes a big difference,'' he said, because it
shifts the burden of proof to the government to deny such claims.
``It's very difficult to prove you are disabled by black lung
disease,'' he said.
   Congress created a special industry-supported fund to pay off
claims by miners with the disease. Coal mine operators already owe
the fund some $3 billion that was lent to it by the federal treasury.
   The Reagan administration had urged the justices to deny the
claims of miners who had missed earlier filing deadlines.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said nothing in
federal law requires the government to reopen settled claims.
   ``There is not even a colorable basis for the contention that
Congress has imposed a duty to reconsider finally determined
claims,'' he said.
   But Scalia said Congress also never intended to exclude from
benefit eligibility miners who worked less than 10 years.
   ``We do not sit to determine what Congress ought to have done
given the evidence before it, but to apply what Congress enacted _
and ... the exclusion of short-term miners from the benefits ...
finds no support'' in a 1977 law aimed at making it easier for
miners to seek benefits, Scalia said.
   The high court overturned a ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals that had ordered the Labor Department to take a fresh
look at claims that were denied in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   The appeals court had directed the department to use the
liberalized standards adopted by Congress in 1977 to determine
benefit eligibility for a group numbering from 94,000 to 155,000.
The cases involved potential benefits estimated at $13.6 billion.
   In other cases, the court:
   _Threw out an appeal by an unwed California father seeking to
restore a parental relationship with his 7-year-old daughter. Eight
days after hearing arguments in Edward McNamara's case, the court
dismissed the appeal for procedural reasons and left unanswered
whether unwed fathers have the same parental rights as unwed mothers.
   _Ruled unanimously that federal employees holding sensitive
intelligence-agency jobs are not entitled to administrative hearings
when fired as security risks. The justices reversed a ruling
requiring a hearing for a National Security Agency employee who says
he was dismissed for homosexual activities.

<HEAD>Poor Nations Account for Four-Fifths of Increase in Older
Population</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It isn't just the Western industrial nations
that face the problems of coping with an aging population, the
Census Bureau reported Tuesday. Four-fifths of the increase in older
people is occurring in the Third World.
   Developing countries currently include 58 percent of all people
aged 55 and over. And those nations account for some 80 percent of
the 1.2 million people who pass that birthday every month, according
to the new Census study ``Aging in the Third World.''
   Even so, it's the richer, developed nations where aging has
attracted the most attention, as longer-lived populations stress the
medical and social welfare systems and generate political interest
and debate.
   Perhaps, the study indicates, the developing nations can learn
from the experience of the countries that faced the problem ahead of
them.
   ``Aging in most developing countries has not yet emerged as a
dominant social phenomenon,'' the by population researcher Kevin
Kinsella observes.
   But over the next 30 years, he points out, the balance is
expected to shift markedly, with some 72 percent of older people
expected to be living in developing nations in the year 2020,
compared to 58 percent today.
   Those countries have the opportunity to learn from the efforts
and mistakes made by the industrialized nations of Europe and North
America, Kinsella reports.
   ``These nations have time to assess demographic projections,
consider structural changes in social institutions such as marriage
and the family, compare and evaluate programmatic responses already
attempted and, in short, debate issues before they are branded as
crises,'' Kinsella concluded.
   With improved medical care extending lifespans, the industrial
nations of Europe and North America have already experienced a sharp
growth in the proportion of elderly in their populations, and the
needs of these groups for medical and social services.
   ``In many cases, however, countries have not aged gracefully,''
Kinsella reports, commenting that belated recognition of the problem
has led to inappropriate and insufficient response on the part of
governments.
   Kinsella's study defines ``older'' people as those 55 and above,
terming those 65 and over as ``elderly'' and referring to the group
75 and over as the ``oldest old.'' He notes, however, that those are
arbitrary labels and that biological, physical and psychological
aging differ from person to person.
   Here are some highlights of the study:
   _The Caribbean is the ``oldest`` developing area with 11.7
percent of its population aged 55 and over. Asia is next at 10.4
percent followed by Latin America at 9.4 percent and Africa, 7.0
percent.
   _In most developing areas the oldest old, those 75 and over, are
increasing faster than the older population in general.
   _Rural areas tend to have higher proportions of older people than
urban areas.
   _Women outlive men in virtually all areas of the world,
regardless the overall life expectancy. Thus, older women outnumber
older men and widowhood is a fact of life for most women.
   _The nature of disease in developing countries is shifting from
communicable to chronic as populations age. The number of disabled
persons in the Third World is likely to grow rapidly, and changing
disease patterns may require a reevaluation of health services.
   _The relative balance between society's two dependent groups, the
old and young, is shifting as declines in fertility reduce the
number of children while longer lives increase the older segment.

   National security demands will require startup
of one of the nuclear weapons production reactors at the
government's Savannah River plant before long-term safety
improvements are completed, according to a Department of Energy
report.
   The department's three reactors at the plant near Aiken, S.C.,
have been shut down due to safety concerns and maintenance needs.
They are the nation's only source for tritium, a radioactive isotope
of hydrogen used in modern nuclear warheads.
   Because tritium decays at a rate of 5.5 percent a year, it needs
to be regularly replenished.
   The report released Tuesday deals with the K reactor at Savannah
River. Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said last week the
department hoped to restart the reactor this spring or summer.
   But the report outlines more than 160 separate tasks for
restarting the reactor, calling for a complete overhaul of training,
safety, management, operating and inspection procedures.
   The measures are ``judged to require a longer-term improvement
program that would take several years,'' it said.
   The Pentagon said Tuesday that some weapons in the U.S. nuclear
arsenal may have to be cannibalized unless at least one of the
tritium-producing reactors at Savannah River is restarted by the end
of this summer.
   ``We're up against the wall if at least one of those reactors is
not started by late this summer,'' said Defense Department spokesman
Lt. Col. Richard L. Oborn. He added that ``ultimately you would have
to cannibalize weapons. You have to get tritium somewhere.''
   Oborn said the Pentagon had considered other options, such as
purchasing tritium from Britain or France, producing tritium in
small Energy Department reactors or setting a new policy that would
allow an increase in tritium decay in existing weapons.
   But, he said, ``the only viable alternative is to start the
(Savannah River) reactors.''
   The Washington Post reported today that the Reagan administration
has rejected an Energy Department appeal for additional money to
repair damaged reactors at the Savannah River plant. Citing reports
from administration sources, it said the department will divert $200
million from other programs to do the repair work.
   Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., a member of the House Armed Services
Committee, said he was planning an inspection trip Dec. 15-16 to
Savannah River. ``I'm particularly interested in the tritium
production cycle,'' said Spratt, whose committee authorizes funding
for the Energy Department weapons facilities.
   ``I think there's been a significant change of attitudes at DOE
and they've put new effort into trying to address the problems they
have,'' he said.
   In another development, the department issued a separate report
providing a preliminary ranking of 155 environmental problems at 16
sites involved with nuclear weapons production.
   ``This is an important step in categorizing environmental
problems in our defense complex,'' Herrington said in releasing the
report. ``It will provide the department with the information
necessary to allocate funds for environmental clean-up in a
systematic and responsible manner.''
   The 232-page report lists each environmental problem found,
provides a public risk assessment for each and describes what
action, if any, is under way to resolve the problem.
   The two most serious problems cited dealt with groundwater
contamination at Rocky Flats outside Denver and the Pantex plant
near Amarillo, Texas. They warranted action by the department before
completion of the survey because of the potential threat they posed,
the report said.
   Twenty-six of the problems ranked fell into a secondary category
of potentia l public hazards. The majority of those problems
involved ``wastewater management and liquid discharges.''

   President-elect George Bush is backing away
from his declaration that the Cold War is not over and says he is
optimistic about reforms adopted by Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Bush was flying to New York to join President Reagan and
Gorbachev in a two-hour meeting on Governors Island today. At a news
conference Tuesday, Bush emphasized that he would participate as
vice president _ not as president-elect _ and that Reagan would be
in charge.
   ``The Soviets know how our system works, and they know that I
become president on Jan. 20,'' Bush said.
   Gorbachev arrived in New York on Tuesday, just minutes after Bush
completed his news conference in Washington. The Soviet leader said
he hoped today's talks would lead to ``an expansion of cooperation''
between Moscow and Washington.
   ``We have not arranged any formal agenda, so either side will be
free openly and frankly to raise any questions that it wishes to,''
Gorbachev said. With the U.S. government in transition, the
administration has said it does not plan to offer or negotiate any
new agreements with the Soviets.
   ``It is only prudent to review foreign policy and to review
national security policy, and certainly to review our relationship
with them,'' Bush said. ``Having said that, I will make clear to the
president (Gorbachev) that we want to go forward. But I'm not going
to be pressed into going beyond that prudent approach.''
   With his national security team still being assembled, Bush said
he did not want to go ``charging off without the benefit of those to
whom I'm going to look for advice.''
   During the presidential campaign, Bush struck a cautious stance
toward the Soviet Union, complimenting the Kremlin on its reforms
but saying it would be judged by its actions over time.
   In a speech last June, Bush declared, ``We've got to remember the
Cold War is not over. We must be bold enough to seize the
opportunity of change but at the same time, as one pundit titled his
column, be prepared for `the protracted conflict.'''
   Asked Tuesday if he still felt the Soviets and Americans are
engaged in a Cold War, Bush said, ``I'm not going to respond in
terms of those words. You have to define for me what you mean by
Cold War.
   ``Do we have any differences with the Soviets? Absolutely. Are
they regional? Yeah. Are they on human rights? Yes. Do we have some
differences on how we ought to approach the arms control agenda?
Certainly.
   ``But do I see _ am I optimistic about what I see in the Soviet
Union? Absolutely,'' Bush said.
   ``And you just take a look at the human rights question. There
have been some good forward steps there, and I want to see more.
   ``I think we come into a great period of opportunity in terms of
reduction of regional tensions,'' he added. ``But there's an awful
lot that the Soviets can do to make me feel I'm right in that. I
think that the arms control agenda is one where we have a chance for
real progress.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists studying the ``greenhouse effect''
causing global warming may be underestimating the warming effect of
many other processes such as the release of methane gas from arctic
tundra, a government analyst said.
   Daniel Lashof, a scientist in the Environmental Protection
Agency's office of policy analysis, reported on studies of effects
neglected in most computerized climate models at a conference
Tuesday organized by the Climate Institute.
   The Institute, a non-profit body supported by government,
foundation and corporate grants, tries to call attention to issues
affecting the climate such as the greenhouse effect, or the expected
warming of the Earth caused by the accumulation in the atmosphere of
gases that trap heat that normally would escape into space.
   The most important of these gases is carbon dioxide formed in the
burning of fossil fuels.
   Such a warming could cause sea levels to rise and flood coastal
areas and lead to stronger hurricanes, drastic shifts in rainfall,
the northward migration of agricultural zones and more frequent
droughts.
   A widely used prediction is for an eventual warming of between
2.7 degrees Fahrenheit and 8.1 degrees sometime in the middle of the
next century.
   Lashof used a computer model that yielded a prediction of 2.7
degrees to 9.9 degrees before he incorporated additional
``biogeochemical'' processes that increased warming might stimulate.
The central prediction from this model was for a warming of 6.3
degrees.
   The augmented model yielded a central prediction for 17.5-degree
warming, 11.2 degrees more than the original model. The range was
from 4 degrees to what Lashof called ``unknown territory'' where he
declined to report a prediction.
   Three ``quite speculative'' processes accounted for 85 percent of
the 11.2-degree increase in Lashof's central prediction:
   _The release of large quantities of methane, also a heat-trapping
gas, from warming arctic tundra.
   _Decreased reflection of sunshine back into space from changes in
the vegetative cover of the Earth.
   _A sharp decline in the oceans' ability to absorb carbon dioxide.
   Other minor processes included such effects as increase methane
emissions from rice paddies and swamps as temperature rises, more
fossil fuel use to generate electricity to meet higher demand for
air conditioning, changes in ocean currents and changes in ocean
chemistry.
   One of the additional effects Lashof studied would slow, rather
than speed, the warming trend. He described it as enhanced growth of
vegetation resulting from more atmospheric carbon dioxide. This
would evaporate more moisture and cool the atmosphere slightly, he
said.

<HEAD>Government Advises Employers To Heed Plant Closing Law Now</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department is advising employers who
plan plant closings or large layoffs in February to heed the terms
of new legislation and begin providing 60 days advance notice now.
   The law _ formally the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification, or WARN, Act _ does not take effect until Feb. 4.
   But the Labor Department said in an ``interim interpretive rule''
that courts might later decide that employers planning layoffs on
that date or immediately afterwards should have given the notices 60
days beforehand, or as early as Dec. 6.
   Unions, which won the legislation last summer after a 15-year
fight in the Congress, favor an interpretation that any worker
losing a job to a plant closing or layoff of 50 people or more as of
Feb. 4 is required to be informed in writing 60 days beforehand.
   However, some business groups have interpreted the law as not
requiring the notices to begin until Feb. 4 _ for closings or
layoffs planned for April 5 or afterwards.
   A third interpretation is that for the first 60 days after the
law takes effect, the length of the advance notices is limited to
the number of days between Feb. 4 and when the plant closing or
layoffs actually occur.
   For example, under this interpretation, a layoff occurring March
6, 1989, would require only 30 days advance notice to the affected
workers and local government officials.
   The Labor Department said in a Federal Register notice that all
three interpretations have merit.
   But until final regulations are issued or, more likely, the
question is resolved in court, it said ``employers are best advised
to proceed conservatively and to provide notice ... as early as Dec.
6 ... in view of this possible liability.''
   No notice is required for layoffs or plant closings that occur
between now and Feb. 4.
   The law was passed by Congress in July and enacted Aug. 4 without
the signature of President Reagan, who called it ``a step in the
wrong direction.'' Congress directed that the law take effect six
months after enactment.
   The legislation was in response to estimates from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics that an average 2.2 million workers a year lost
their jobs to plant closings and mass layoffs during the first half
of the decade.
   Government studies showed that more than half of those workers
received less than two weeks advance notice and that only 18 percent
of employers provided three weeks or more notice.
   The Labor Department has been advising business groups since
October that they should look upon Dec. 6 as the day to start
providing the notices. So have major business groups which opposed
the law, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National
Association of Manufacturers.
   Sue Meisinger, a vice president for the American Society of
Personnel Administration, said the effective date that notices are
required is one of several ambiguities in the law.
   ``You're going to find out how the ambiguities work out only
after litigation,'' she said. ``There are a lot of issues to be
played out over time. A lot of employers are going to find out how
the law works only after they get slapped with a civil complaint.''
   Because the law does not empower any agency to enforce it,
failure to comply with it can be addressed only through federal
civil suits filed by affected employees, unions or local governments.
   The courts can order up to 60 days in back pay and benefits plus
attorneys' fees to affected workers and fines of up to $30,000
payable to local governments not notified as required by the law.
   The law forbids companies with 100 or more full-time workers at
any one location from ordering a plant closed or a mass layoff
involving 50 or more people until 60 days after they have provided
written notice to the affected employees, union representatives and
local government officials.
   Exempted from coverage are companies with fewer than 100
full-time workers, temporary layoffs of less than six months and
layoffs caused by natural disasters such as last summer's drought.
   Employers also do not have to provide advance notice if the
layoffs were caused by strikes or lockouts or unforeseeable business
circumstances such as the unexpected cancellation of a major
contract.

   Carla Hills, ex-Cabinet official, lawyer, wife,
mother and top tennis player, is a role model for today's superwoman.
   Mrs. Hills, 54, selected Tuesday by President-elect George Bush
to serve as his U.S. trade representative, is the only woman named
so far to a senior position in the new administration.
   She has been on a fast track since her early days in California.
   The daughter of a wealthy Los Angeles businessman, Hills got her
first top job in Washington in 1975 when President Ford named her
secretary of housing and urban development. Her father, Carl
Anderson, was once chairman of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.
   At the time she was confirmed, Mrs. Hills was only the third
woman Cabinet officer in history and the first in 20 years. Since
then, six woman have served in Cabinet posts, including former U.N.
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, who was given Cabinet status.
President Reagan elevated the trade representative's job to Cabinet
level.
   Ford found Mrs. Hills in the Justice Department, where she was an
assistant attorney general in charge of the civil division. Some
criticized her appointment to HUD, saying she did not know enough
about housing issues.
   While she was serving at HUD, her husband, Roderick Hills, held
another top job in Washington as chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   During her two years, she tried to work with private enterprise
to encourage communities to provide more low-income housing.
   Since leaving government, Mrs. Hills has worked in private law
practice, most recently as co-director of the Washington office of
the New York firm of Weil, Gotshal and Manges. She also serves on
the boards of several large corporations and is active in legal
associations.
   Mrs. Hills was ambitious and hard-working even as a young girl,
according to friends and associates.
   Early in her professional life, she said she was never given
special treatment because she was a woman. ``That certainly wasn't
true in our law firm and it wasn't true in the Justice Department,''
she said.
   ``She is a strong-willed administrator who is receptive to new
ideas and new challenges,'' Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley once said
of her. ``She is bright and perceptive ... And she is hard working.''
   Others who know Mrs. Hills have described her as organized, tough
and determined.
   ``There is a certain amount of iron there,'' said one attorney
who had worked with her.
   Mrs. Hills, who grew up in Beverly Hills, was a honor student at
Stanford University where she met her future husband, an ex-football
player who was attending law school.
   After graduating, she studied at Oxford University in England and
then went to Yale Law School, where she graduated 20th in a class of
167.
   Back in California, she was an assistant U.S. attorney in Los
Angeles, and then was in private practice at a firm where her
husband was a partner.
   The mother of three daughters and a son, ages 19 to 29, Mrs.
Hills insisted on spending two hours every evening with her family
when the children were young.
   She said it was a challenge to juggle demands of both career and
family. ``I used to say that sometimes I feel like a long piece of
salami with a slice here for one and a slice here for another and
there isn't enough to go around,'' she said.
   ``She's combined being a wife and mother with fantastic
contributions to society,'' a former roommate, Beatrice Herrick,
said several years ago.
   Also high on Mrs. Hills' agenda is sports. She is a top-flight
tennis player, regularly beating her husband.
   As the trade representative, Mrs. Hills will be confronted by
numerous challenges involving complex international negotiations.
High on the agenda are the changing U.S. relationship with the
European Economic Community, which is set to integrate in 1992, and
implementation of the U.S.-Canada trade agreement.

   On the surface, the biography of Robert Mosbacher
Sr. reads just like George Bush's: born to a wealthy Northeastern
family, attended prep school and ventured off to Texas to make
millions in the oil business.
   Both also have been successful in mixing their money and oil with
politics. But until now, Mosbacher has been content to stay in the
background, raising the money to finance the political career of his
friend of more than 30 years.
   On Tuesday, Bush announced he was bringing his acquaintance from
Texas days into the government, as secretary of commerce in the Bush
administration.
   ``A friend of long standing, a very successful leader in the
business community,'' Bush termed him at a news conference.
   Mosbacher, 61, has raised campaign funds for Bush in every
political race he has entered since his second unsuccessful campaign
for the Senate in 1970.
   Mosbacher served as Bush's finance chairman during the
presidential campaign and raised nearly $20 million to help the vice
president secure the nomination. He also was chairman of the
Republican Party's ``Team 100'' program that raised $24 million from
individuals and corporations in $100,000 donations. He and his
companies directly contributed $47,600 to the Republican National
Committee.
   Like Bush, Mosbacher came to Texas to learn about the oil
business and invest family money. Bush learned the ways of the oil
patch and helped establish tiny Zapata Petroleum Co. which later
became Pennzoil Co.; Mosbacher established Mosbacher Petroleum Co.
in Houston.
   Mosbacher split from his father and older brother explaining, ``I
may not be a very much of a leader, but I'm a lousy follower.'' Bush
also struck out on his own as a young man.
   Mosbacher's father, Emil, began as a runner for the American
Stock Exchange and soon began trading on the exchange himself. By
age 21, he was a millionaire. The elder Mosbacher also managed to
liquidate before the market crash of 1929.
   In an effort to teach his sons to be stern, the father sent
Robert and older brother, Emil Jr., to strict prep schools _ Robert
attended The Choate School in Wallingford, Conn. _ and got them
interested in sailing to instill competition.
   In 1948 at age 21 with an economic degree from Washington and Lee
University, a pregnant wife and about $500,000 from his father,
Robert left the family home in suburban White Plains, N.Y., and
headed to Texas.
   Forty years later with interests also in real estate and
ranching, Mosbacher is worth an estimated $200 million. He lives
near Houston's exclusive River Oaks neighborhood with his third
wife, socialite Georgette Mosbacher, who recently purchased La
Prairie skin care company for $35 million.
   The couple have been married three years; she was once married to
George Barrie, former owner of Faberge, and is a former vice
president of Brut Productions, a Faberge division.
   Mosbacher, 61, becomes the third Texan named to Bush's Cabinet.
Bush previously named his campaign chairman, James A. Baker III of
Houston, as secretary of state and retained Lauro Cavazos of Lubbock
as secretary of education. Former Texas Sen. John Tower also is
being considered for secretary of defense.
   Mosbacher worked for the election of President Ford in 1976 and
was the finance co-chairman of the national Republican Party.
   In 1964, he headed a committee _ Oil Men for Bush _ during Bush's
unsuccessful bid for the Senate and served on Bush's finance
committee during his second unsuccessful race for the Senate in 1970.
   It was Mosbacher and Baker who persuaded Bush to withdraw from
the 1980 presidential race so he could be considered for the vice
presidential nomination by Ronald Reagan.
   Bush has described Mosbacher as a ``close confidant'' ad ``a
friend.''
   Mosbacher's fund-raising abilities have brought him into the
elite of the Republican Party. He took over Ford's campaign when the
coffers were almost empty after David W. Packard resigned following
three unsuccessful months. He immediately asked for help from his
own list of 1,700 people. In the end, Mosbacher raised over $14
million, about $2.5 million more than President Carter raised.
   Among the tasks facing the new secretary will be the
implementation of the new free-trade agreement between the United
States and Canada, assuming the Canadians ratify it.
   Even though most of Mosbacher's life has been centered on the oil
and gas business, fellow independent oilman Michel Halbouty of
Houston is confident he will do a good job.
   ``He has a very good business mind. He knows the relationship of
foreign trade and domestic trade. He's traveled the world and has a
broad viewpoint of other countries,'' Halbouty said of Mosbacher,
whom he has known for 35 years.
   ``You can bring a problem to him and he'll listen. He can get
along with just anybody. He has a strong affinity to people.''
   Mosbacher is no stranger to Washington. He went there often
during the spring and summer to offer advice to Bush. His older
brother Emil, known by his nickname Bus, served as chief of protocol
in the Nixon administration.
   Robert Mosbacher's son, Rob, ran for a U.S. Senate seat from
Texas in 1983, but lost in the Republican primary.

<HEAD>Bush Choice as Top Economic Adviser Helped Create `Flexible Freeze'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Economist Michael J. Boskin, selected by
George Bush on Tuesday to head the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, was a key architect of Bush's ``flexible freeze'' approach
to deficit reduction.
   Boskin, 43, a highly regarded Stanford University professor,
helped develop the plan while serving as a top Bush campaign adviser
on economic matters.
   The political beauty of the flexible-freeze plan is that it
doesn't commit Bush to any specific budget cuts. Instead, it calls
for the growth in overall government spending to be held to the rate
of inflation.
   Critics of the plan have charged that it is unworkable and would
force Draconian reductions in some areas of domestic spending to
make up for faster growth in such programs as Social Security, which
Bush has vowed to leave untouched.
   But in a Washington speech Tuesday, Boskin defended the flexible
freeze and predicted it would be able to balance the budget around
1993, depending on how fast the economy grows in the next few years.
   ``I think you will see the Bush administration take strong action
on the budget deficit quickly after the inauguration and I think it
will be on the spending side of the budget, consistent with the
flexible freeze,'' Boskin said at a policy conference sponsored by
the American Enterprise Institute.
   ``I can assure you that people who are very careful with numbers,
myself included, have gone over this and it is eminently do-able,''
he said. ``So the accusations that this doesn't add up are kind of
silly and not based on economic reality.''
   Boskin has Washington experience, working as a consultant to the
Defense, Treasury, Labor and old Health, Education and Welfare
departments as well as serving on a host of task forces.
   A native of New York, Boskin moved to Los Angeles with his family
when he was 6. His father was working as a construction contractor,
his mother as a bookkeeper and then an accountant. He studied
economics at the University of California at Berkeley, where he was
named the outstanding graduate of the class of 1967.
   Boskin wrote his doctoral dissertation on the effects of welfare
and other income-maintenance programs on the size of the labor force.
   He is described today as a hard-line Republican, but at Berkeley
in the tumultuous '60s Boskin was known as quite liberal.
   ``I was sympathetic with the goals _ freedom of speech, civil
rights _ and I still am,'' he said earlier this year. ``But I was
not sympathetic with the methods,'' such as student sit-ins and
strikes.
   He went from Berkeley to Stanford, where he has been ever since
except for a year of teaching at Harvard a decade ago and brief
periodic consulting jobs for Congress.
   Besides his unpaid campaign work for Bush this year, Boskin has
been busy writing two books on economics, teaching a graduate course
in fiscal policy and an introductory economics course, and acting as
West Coast director of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a
think tank.
   While he acknowledges that growth in wages has fallen behind the
pace of the 1950s and '60s, he contends it is a byproduct of rapid
job growth and says overall living standards have not declined.
   ``We have the beginning of some major transformations in the role
of government in the economy. We've had success in reducing marginal
tax rates. ... We have to build on what we have,'' Boskin said.
   Boskin was sharply critical of President Reagan's early policies
in his book entitled ``Reagan and the Economy: The Successes,
Failures and Unfinished Agenda.''
   But like Bush, who eight years ago branded Reagan's campaign
promises ``voodoo economics,'' Boskin joined the team and now saves
his barbs for the Democrats. Like Bush, Boskin opposes a general tax
increase under any circumstances.
   ``I'm concerned that a big tax increase could lead to a sharp
slowdown in the economy, or that a major new round of spending could
create major new future problems,'' he said.
   Boskin is among those who persuaded Bush to advocate cutting the
capital-gains tax rate. He also played a key role in Bush's call for
``individual savings accounts,'' a plan ridiculed by the Democrats
and some economists during the campaign. The savings plan would
offer tax-deferred interest to low- and middle-income Americans on
long-term savings deposits.

<HEAD>Webster Brings Agencies Out Of Shadow Of Scandal</HEAD>

   William Webster, who was second choice as FBI
director a decade ago and again as CIA director in 1987, has led
both agencies out of the shadow of scandal.
   President-elect George Bush asked Webster on Tuesday to continue
to head the nation's top foreign intelligence agency.
   Webster, 64, pledged at his confirmation hearings last year to
keep members of congressional oversight committees fully informed of
CIA activities. His predecessor, the late William Casey, had been
criticized for hiding details of the Iran-Contra affair from
Congress.
   ``I have total confidence that he is the man, the best man to
build and lead our national intelligence community,'' Bush said in
announcing Webster's reappointment. Bush, who led the CIA himself
for a year under President Ford, said Webster's appointment was
``open-ended.''
   Webster announced before his confirmation that to avoid the
appearance of being ``a political animal'' he had asked to have the
CIA director's post removed from the president's Cabinet. Casey had
been the first CIA director to serve at the Cabinet level. The CIA
job is to remain a non-Cabinet position under Bush.
   Webster, a former federal judge from St. Louis who had headed the
FBI for nine years, was picked by President Reagan for the CIA job
after Deputy CIA Director Robert M. Gates had his nomination
withdrawn because of Senate questions about his role in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Webster agreed during confirmation hearings to review Gates'
testimony to Congress on the affair but deterimined he did nothing
that should prevent him from continuing as deputy. Gates also is to
remain in the No. 2 CIA post in the Bush administration, agency
spokesman Bill Baker said.
   Webster, a Republican, was nominated in 1978 by Democratic
President Carter to head the FBI, whose two previous directors had
been embroiled in political controversy. He was nominated after
Frank M. Johnson Jr., another federal judge, withdrew his name
because of ill health.
   The FBI's image had been sullied by revelations of personal
vendettas the bureau carried out for the late J. Edgar Hoover,
illegal surveillance of Vietnam war protesters and actions by acting
Director L. Patrick Gray III to hamper investigations into the
unfolding Watergate scandal in the early 1970s.
   In nine years asFBI director, Webster was popular with Congress.
His confirmation to become the 14th head of the CIA passed
unanimously in the Senate Intelligence Committee and was approved
94-1 by the full Senate.
   In 18 months at the CIA helm, Webster has improved the agency's
relations with Congress. He has pledged to disclose to congressional
leaders, in all but the most pressing circumstances, covert foreign
intelligence activities within 48 hours after the president approves
them.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the Intelligence Committee chairman,
praised Webster's reappointment, saying the director had ``helped
restore public confidence in the CIA during a very troubling
period.''
   Last March, Webster told a congressional committee he had
reorganized the spy agency to improve counterintelligence and
strengthen security at U.S. embassies.
   Webster, who grew up in the St. Louis suburb of Webster Groves,
Mo., received a bachelor's degree from Amherst College and a law
degree in 1949 from Washington University in St. Louis.
   He served briefly as U.S. attorney for eastern Missouri and was
appointed to the U.S. District Court bench by President Nixon in
1971 and to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1973.
   Webster, a widower, has three children.

   Thomas Pickering, selected by President-elect
George Bush as ambassador to the United Nations, is a veteran of 29
years' service in the Foreign Service with ambassadorships in El
Salvador, Israel, Jordan and Nigeria.
   Pickering, 57, is currently ambassador to Israel, where he can
indulge his interest in archaeology and is trying to add Hebrew to
the languages in which he is already proficient: French, Spanish,
Arabic and Swahili.
   If confirmed by the Senate, Pickering will replace Vernon
Walters, who spent 3{ years at the United Nations after serving as
ambassador at large during President Reagan's first term in office.
   Pickering's primary experience is in the Middle East, where he
also was ambassador to Jordan from 1974 to 1978 during President
Jimmy Carter's administration.
   Jordan's King Hussein called Pickering ``the best American
ambassador I've ever dealt with.''
   His service earlier in this decade in Nigeria and knowledge of
Swahili will help him in his dealings with Africa, the largest
regional bloc at the United Nations.
   But Pickering may be best known for the attention surrounding his
choice as ambassador to El Salvador in 1983.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz was not keen on a potential
candidate for the Salvador post being recommended by National
Security Council aides.
   To head off that choice, Shultz was determined to come up with an
alternate candidate. He reviewed the department's list of its
highest-ranked career diplomats.
   Near the top was Pickering. Shultz selected him, sensing that an
experienced hand was needed in El Salvador at a time when the
country was undergoing a difficult transition to democratic rule,
with both an active rebel movement and right-wing death squads
proliferating.
   Led by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., conservatives fought Pickering's
assignment as ambassador to El Salvador, objecting to his previous
ties to Carter administration policies.
   Helms and other conservatives objected to Carter's policies
toward Third World countries, including treaties that the critics
felt did not adequately protect U.S. interests _ agreements that set
standards for deep sea mining, barred the use of the moon for
military purposes and set fishing agreements with Canada and Latin
American countries.
   Pickering cut short his tour of duty in Nigeria and accepted the
assignment in El Salvador, where he remained until he was sent to
Israel in 1985.
   In war-torn El Salvador, Pickering took a low key approach to the
job, but ran into controversy anyway.
   Helms wanted Pickering dismissed from that job, claiming
Pickering had interfered with elections in the Latin American
nation, to the detriment of right-wing candidates, an allegation
Pickering denied.
   Ultimately, when Pickering was named to the Israel
ambassadorship, Helms voted for him, saying his objections in the El
Salvador matter had been related to U.S. policy rather than to
Pickering's capabilities.
   Pickering was ambassador to Nigeria in 1981 to 1983, and
assistant secretary of state for oceans and international
environmental and scientific affairs in 1978 to 1981.
   He was ambassador to Jordan from 1974 to 1978 and previously
served in a variety of State Department and other foreign service
posts.
   He was deputy chief of mission in Dar es Salaam, the capital of
Tanzania, from 1967 to 1969 and was principal officer in Zanzibar _
now part of Tanzania _ from 1965 to 1967.
   In the early 1960s he was political officer in Geneva at the U.S.
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
   Born in Orange, N.J., Pickering graduated from Bowdoin College
and received graduate degrees from the Fletcher College of Law and
Diplomacy at Tufts University and from the University of Melbourne.

the top job because of the Iran-Contra affair. Gates withdrew his
nomination.
   A native of St. Louis, Webster received his bachelor's degree
from Amherst College and a law degree from Washington University in
St. Louis.
   He practiced law in St. Louis and served briefly as U.S. attorney

<HEAD>Panel Suggests Possible Curbs On Advertising For Alcohol</HEAD>

   The portrayal of alcoholic beverages in
national advertising likely contributes to under-age drinking, and
government limits on such ads eventually may be needed, according to
a group studying alcohol use by minors.
   The National Commission Against Drunken Driving suggested in a
report released Tuesday that if the alcohol and advertising
industries do not impose reforms ``legislation should be enacted to
regulate alcohol beverage advertising.''
   The panel did not say what kind of regulation it envisioned or
how much time the industry should be given to make changes in its
alcohol advertising.
   The report is part of a continuing examination by the commission
of efforts to curb drunken driving. The commission was formed five
years ago to continue where a presidential commission on drunken
driving left off.
   During a series of public hearings around the country, repeated
testimony from teen-agers indicated a link between advertisements
and a widespread view among young people that alcohol is a normal
part of a social event, the report said.
   ``With near unanimity, the youths themselves declared that
advertising encourages adolescents to drink,'' the commission said.
   V.J. Adduci, commission chairman, said at a news conference the
panel was not suggesting the need for immediate government
intervention in alcoholic beverage advertising, but wanted to send a
message to the industries involved to ``take a look at your
advertising'' and ``act like a parent'' when putting together ads
widely watched by youngsters too young to legally purchase alcoholic
drinks.
   Bob Hallahan, a spokesman for the National Association of
Broadcasters said his group agreed with Adduci's comments. ``He's
not looking for any legislation, but with working with the
industry,'' said Hallahan. He noted that his organization, which
opposes advertising curbs, also is represented on the commission.
   A spokeswoman for the Association of National Advertisers said
the group would have no comment because it had not seen the
commission report. Officials of the Beer Institute could not be
reached for comment Tuesday.
   The commission report, summarizing the results of its five public
hearings, said that despite grass-roots efforts against drunken
driving, laws in every state against minors purchasing alcoholic
beverages and many anti-drunken driving programs, ``young people
continue to drink and drive with alarming frequency.''
   As a result, young people ``continue to be involved in
alcohol-related crashes at disproportionately high rates,'' the
commission said. ``A young person under the legal drinking age
remains nearly twice as likely to die in an alcohol-related crash as
an adult over 21.''
   The report noted that between 1982 and 1987 the number of
alcohol-related fatalities among people under 21 declined by 21.9
percent, but ``drinking and driving continues to be the number one
killer of teenagers.''
   Last year the alcohol-related highway fatality rate was 19 per
100,000 for those under 21 years of age compared to 11 per 100,000
for those 21 years or older, the report said. It said while youth
under 21 years of age account for only 8 percent of the total
driving population, they account for 17 percent of the drivers
involved in alcohol-related fatal highway crashes.
   The report included these other conclusions, based on testimony
at the public hearings:
   _ ``Drinking is endemic among American youths (and) alcoholic
beverages remain easily accessible to youth under 21.
   _ ``Peer pressure encourages young people to drink and leads many
adolescents to consider alcohol a necessary accompaniment to social
events.
   _ ``Advertising normalizes alcohol consumption and makes it more
difficult to raise concerns about alcohol abuse.''
   In a letter to President Reagan accompanying the release of the
report, Adduci, the commission chairman, wrote:
   ``It is not enough to lament the thousands of young lives that
are lost each year on American highways. We must end the senseless
behavior that makes alcohol-related crashes the American way to die
for youth of driving age.''

<HEAD>Fund-raisers Used Scare Tactics Against Texas Retiree</HEAD>

   s
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) _ Political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche's
fund-raisers warned of Soviet missiles, AIDS, international bankers
and illicit drugs to persuade a skeptical Texas retiree to make
$25,000 in loans that were never repaid.
   The high-pressure telephone tactics used on Max Harrell of
Pasadena, Texas, were disclosed Tuesday at LaRouche's mail and tax
fraud conspiracy trial in U.S. District Court.
   Harrell said he taped the conversations with fund-raisers Rebecca
Jones and Paul Greenberg because he had never received the promised
quarterly interest payments on his first $10,000 loan in April 1986.
   ``I was a bit nervous about getting these loans repaid,'' he told
government prosecutors.
   The lawyers quoted Greenberg as telling Harrell during one phone
call that ``all those dollars and cents you are hanging onto won't
matter a whit if the world collapsed.''
   The transcript of another recorded conversation between Harrell
and Ms. Jones quoted the fund-raiser as saying:
   ``In the scope of human history what you're going to be
remembered for is not whether you got 10 or 15 percent. Right? In
scope of human history what you're going to be remembered for is
that you had the foresight and the courage to back a fight to save
not only this nation but Western civilization...''
   When Harrell balked at making another loan to the LaRouche
organization, Ms. Jones warned that ``the Russians are churning out
three ICBMs every 48 hours'' and said money was needed to ``see the
international bankers defeated.''
   She also cited the AIDS epidemic and LaRouche's war against
drugs. ``Money for us is simply the means to do what we've got to do
politically, and the point right now is if we can escalate now, we
can turn the corner,'' she said.
   Harrell complained that he was ``doing a perpetual give as it is
with these loans,'' but Ms. Jones assured him that ``the loans
you're gonna get back.''
   ``Yeah,'' she said, ``you're taking a risk. But I've never said
anything other than that, so it's not like I'm trying to screw you
out of your money.''
   Harrell said he agreed reluctantly to extend two additional loans
because, even though retired, he could afford it.
   But he told questioners that he had received ``not a penny'' of
repayment.
   Harry Chusid, an accountant and auditor for the Internal Revenue
Service, testified Tuesday that his search of computer files at
LaRouche headquarters in Leesburg, Va., indicated that $33.3 million
had been borrowed from individual supporters from 1983 until
LaRouche's offices were raided by federal agents in October 1986.
   Chusid said $3.7 million in interest and principal had been
repaid during the same period.
   LaRouche, a perennial minor-party presidential candidate, and six
associates _ including Greenberg _ are charged with mail fraud and
conspiracy for allegedly raising more than $30 million in loans with
no intention of repaying them.
   LaRouche is charged separately with conspiracy to defraud the IRS
by having all his personal expenses paid by various corporations he
controls and failing to file federal income tax returns since 1978.
   LaRouche denies any wrongdoing. If convicted on all 13 counts
against him, he faces a maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and
fines totaling $3.25 million.
   Wayne Hintz, a former LaRouche finance officer, testified Tuesday
that he resigned in June 1986 when he came to the conclusion that
the growing number of loans to the LaRouche organization weren't
going to be repaid.
   But Hintz said he was unaware of any official policy against
honoring the terms of the loans, which he said had swollen from $10
million to about $40 million during 1985 alone.

<HEAD>New Yorker Cartoonist Charles Saxon Dead At 68</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cartoonist Charles D. Saxon, whose
drawings satirized the lifestyles of the sophisticated in The New
Yorker for three decades, died of heart failure Tuesday. He was 68.
   A spokeswoman at St. Joseph Medical Center in Stamford said
Saxon, who lived in New Canaan, died early Tuesday morning.
   A staff cartoonist at The New Yorker since 1956, Saxon did 725
drawings and 92 covers for the magazine.
   His work appeared in many major magazines, in advertisements for
dozens of corporate clients including American Airlines, Bankers
Trust and Chivas Regal, and in three book collections.
   ``In his art he always sought to do not just humor but also
social commentary,'' said author Vance Packard, who was his friend
and neighbor in New Canaan for 34 years. ``His main interest was in
the lifestyles of the presumably sophisticated, and he saw himself
as an interpreter of their world.''
   ``Chuck's elegantly designed and meticulously rendered covers and
drawings were in the classic tradition of social satire that reaches
back to Daumier and Gavarni,'' said Lee Lorenz, art editor of The
New Yorker. ``Seen as a whole, his work constitutes a unique social
history of our time.''
   Saxon was born on Nov. 13, 1920 in Brooklyn, N.Y., into a family
of musicians. He entered Columbia University at age 15, studying
drumming and working in jazz bands before graduating while stil a
teen-ager.
   Saxon was a pilot in the Army Air Corps, leading a bomber
squadron in combat flights over Germany during World War II.
   He became a full-time cartoonist in 1955.
   He is survived by his wife, Nancy, two sons, a daughter and three
grandchildren.

   Mikhail Gorbachev wanted to ``take a bite out of
the Big Apple,'' his aides said, and today's meanderings seemed
certain to give him a pungent taste, seeds and all.
   The Soviet leader is seeing the city at its best, with crisp fall
air, bright Christmas lights and _ for him, at least _ wide open
streets. It's a great time to be a tourist, especially with a 45-car
motorcade and full police escort.
   He's likely to remember the glint of light off the Statue of
Liberty, the day-long dusk of Wall Street, the stomach-plunging
elevator ride to the top of the World Trade Center and the
breathtaking view from the top of the 110-story skyscraper.
   But New York is never pristine, and there's been no frantic
effort to change that. No one has been filling in potholes, painting
over graffiti or sedating city denizens.
   Gorbachev's New York slide show could include hulking tenements
on the Lower East Side, tawdry porn shops in Times Square and maybe
_ just maybe _ some of the city's legions of homeless people.
   Ironically, he may have avoided an encounter with the homeless by
passing up a visit to glittering Trump Tower. Robert Hayes, a
spokesman for the Coalition for the Homeless, said there had been
plans to mount a demonstration until his group learned that
Gorbachev apparently had declined tycoon Donald Trump's invitation.
   Hayes accused police on the East Side _ where the United Nations
and the Soviet Mission are located _ of persuading homeless people
to migrate to the West Side, out of Gorbachev's sight.
   According to Hayes, one officer reportedly told a homeless man,
``Go West, young man.''
   But a police spokesman, Detective Joseph McConville, said he was
unaware of such tactics. ``Why would we do that?'' he asked.
   Today's itinerary included the United Nations, where few New
Yorkers go, and Governor's Island, where few New Yorkers are
permitted (it's a Coast Guard base), particularly at a lunch with
President Reagan and President-elect George Bush.
   Other snapshots from the Gorbachev camera during his two-day
visit could include Carnegie Hall's understated facade and that
bright red restaurant next door _ the Russian Tea Room, where the
spirit of the imperial Romanovs is alive and well.
   There's the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge, the FDR
Drive and Broadway, Central Park and Battery Park and tiny Gen.
Douglas MacArthur Park.
   And then there's the Metropolitan Museum, one of the spots
Gorbachev was reportedly eager to see. The description in the
American Institute of Architects' Guide to New York could stand as a
description for the city Gorbachev is getting to know:
   ``It is a rich and exciting melange,'' the guidebook says of the
Metropolitan's exterior, ``exciting, grand, controversial, often
elegant, sometimes banal. ... Mandatory contribution on entry.''

   Dan Quayle is seeking insights on the vice
presidency from Walter Mondale, a Democrat who held the job for four
years under President Jimmy Carter.
   The vice president-elect was meeting over breakfast this morning
at his office with Mondale for the second in a series of discussions
with men who have held the job.
   Quayle met with former President Richard Nixon last week _ Nixon
served as vice president to Dwight Eisenhower _ and he will see
former President Gerald Ford next week, said press spokesman Jeff
Nesbit. Ford was Nixon's second vice president.
   The purpose of the meeting with Mondale, who along with Carter
was much maligned by Quayle during the campaign, is ``to discuss the
office of the vice presidency ... what's possible, what's not,''
said Nesbit.
   Mondale, a former senator from Minnesota, ran unsuccessfully for
president against President Reagan in 1984, losing in a landslide
that saw Mondale win only the District of Columbia and his home
state.
   Among the topics will be the vice president's role as president
of the Senate. Quayle is interested in exploring ways to develop and
expand the position.
   Quayle also has selected veteran Time magazine correspondent
David Beckwith to be his press secretary when he takes office as
vice president.
   Beckwith, who has been with Time since 1969, recently covered the
Bush campaign for 15 months. He was considered for an appointment as
Bush's White House press secretary, but that job went to current
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who had worked in that
capacity for Bush before Reagan tapped him.
   The reporter said he is looking at the position with Quayle as
``a great opportunity for me.''
   Noting the barrage of negative press that has rained down on the
Indiana senator since Bush selected him, Beckwith said some of that
negativity is unjustified.
   ``I've talked to him a lot over the last couple weeks. I realize
he's a lot better than his press notices would make him appear,''
Beckwith said.
   Beckwith, a Chicago native, also formerly worked for the
Minneapolis Star and the Houston Chronicle. He has a law degree from
the University of Texas, a masters in journalism from Columbia
University and an undergraduate degree from Carleton College in
Northfield, Minn.

<HEAD>Psychologists Doubt Television Hurts Children's Education</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is no scientific evidence to support the
common belief that children's homework done while watching
television is of poorer quality than homework done with the box
turned off, two psychologists have asserted.
   The surprising findings are contained in a paper, ``The Impact on
Children's Education: Influence on Cognitive Development,''
distributed by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of
Educational Research and Improvement.
   The authors, University of Massachusetts psychology professor
Daniel R. Anderson and graduate student Patricia A. Collins, did not
conduct original research or studies with children. They said the
research literature behind many common assertions about television's
impact on children is ``sparse.''
   But their reading of the available studies led them to the
following conclusions:
   _``There is no evidence that television has a mesmerizing effect
on children's attention caused by color, movement and visual
changes.''
   _``Contrary to popular assertions, children are cognitively
active during television viewing and attempt to form a coherent,
connected understanding of television programs.''
   _``There is no evidence that children generally get
overstimulated by television.''
   _Television viewing generally displaces not reading but ``movie
attendance, radio listening, comic book reading and participation in
organized sports.''
   _``There is no evidence that homework done during television
viewing is of lower quality than homework done in silence.''
   _There is little evidence to show that television viewing reduces
children's attention span, and some indicating it may actually
increase their ability to focus attention.
   _``There is no evidence that television makes children
cognitively `passive.'''
   _``There is some weak evidence that television availability
reduces reading achievement,'' but if so, this ``appears to occur
during the early elementary school years and is probably temporary.''
   In sum, the authors said, ``The research literature provides
little support for most of the common beliefs about the influence of
television.''
   American children send an average of 12 to 25 hours a week
watching television.
   Lest parents despair of ever weaning their offspring from the
tube, they can point to tests that show those who spent the most
hours each day in front of the television generally performed well
below average.
   According to a National Assessment of Educational Progress
reading test given in 1984, 9-year-olds who watched six hours or
more of television a day scored sharply lower than those who watched
less. But there was little difference between those who watched less
than two hours of television per day and those who watched three to
five hours.
   Among 13- and 17-year-olds tested, reading scores went up as
television watching went down, with those who watched two hours or
less scoring higher than those who watched three to five hours, and
the latter outscoring those who watched six hours or more.
   Chester E. Finn Jr., until recently the assistant secretary of
education for research and improvement, said in an interview:
``We've known for a long time that some TV is good for some kids.
For the most disadvantaged kids, some TV actually appears to
increase their cultural literacy.''
   Finn, who read a draft of the Anderson-Collins study last summer,
said, ``This tends to exonerate television more than common sense
and my own intuition and other research I've read over the years
would seem to warrant.''

   R. Sargent Shriver and the Baltimore Orioles'
acting president Larry Lucchino have joined two other investors to
buy the baseball team for $70 million.
   The announcement of the sale was made Tuesday at Atlanta, site of
baseball's winter meetings.
   The sale by Mrs. Agnes Williams, widow of Orioles owner Edward
Bennett Williams, must be approved by three-quarters of the American
League owners and a majority of National League owners.
   Bobby Brown, the American League president, said the time frame
for making the decision on the sale is within 90 days, although it
could come sooner.
   The Orioles were sold to a group headed by New York businessman
Eli S. Jacobs, a Wall Street investor who becomes the team's
majority owner. Lucchino, Shriver, the Democratic vice-presidential
candidate in 1972, and Shriver's son, Robert S. Shriver, also will

<HEAD>Alfonsin Cites Reasons For Military Uprising</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Raul Alfonsin says the
third military uprising in 20 months had its origins with soldiers'
low pay, poor equipment and resentment of their censure by society
for harshly repressing guerrilla activities in the 1970s.
   In his longest remarks on the four-day insurrection that ended
Sunday and a rare speech on the military, the man whose election in
1983 ended eight years of military rule defended his lengthy
resolution of the crisis.
   ``The convincing and persuading took so long precisely because no
condition was accepted,'' Alfonsin was quoted as telling leaders of
the CONINAGRO farm cooperatives Tuesday in a speech at the state
Bank of the Nation.
   ``A dialogue of more than two hours (is better than) a battle,
even if it lasted just five minutes, which could have cost Argentine
lives,'' Alfonsin said. ``We should thank God that all this could be
solved without having to lament the deaths of hundreds of Argentines
...''
   Three people died in the uprising, the bloodiest of the three
revolts sparked by the military since April 1987. Three soldiers
were wounded by a rebel mine blast in last January's uprising.
   Meanwhile, the 6th mechanized infantry regiment at Mercedes
remained in rebel hands Tuesday, although Maj. Hugo Avete said he
was simply was awaiting his replacement by a new commander, which
was expected later today, the government news agency Telam reported.
   The base, 62 miles west of the capital, ``is in the process of
being normalized,'' Defense Ministry spokesman Faustino Altamirano
said.
   Rebel commander Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin remained in detention
at a military garrison in Buenos Aires. The approximately 500 troops
who had rallied to his side at the Campo de Mayo army base in
suburban Buenos Aires have returned to their units, Altamirano said.
   ``An investigation will take place to clear up who was
responsible for what, and they will be punished,'' Altamirano said.
   Sixty-three coast guardsmen who sided with Seineldin were
imprisoned at the Campo de Mayo. Federal Judge Alberto Piotti was to
begin interrogating them Thursday.
   Alfonsin noted that it is up to the courts, not him, to resolve
one of the rebels' key demands _ an end to the prosecution of
officers for human rights abuses committed during the 1976-83
military dictatorship.
   At least 8,900 suspected leftists were arrested by security
forces and vanished, according to a commission appointed by
Alfonsin. The ``disappeared'' are presumed executed.
   Rebels also demanded a shakeup in the army command, including,
according to local news agencies that cite military and rebel
sources, the removal of army chief of staff Gen. Jose Dante Caridi.
   Caridi ``might well have to go,'' the English-language Buenos
Aires Herald said Tuesday in an editorial, ``because of his failure
to anticipate this crisis and because of the extreme reluctance of
many army units to adopt action stations, thus denoting lack of
control over his force.''
   Alfonsin denounced critics who have wondered aloud whether a
secret deal was made with the rebels. He was quoted as calling them
``vampires ... who apparently feel sad because solutions were
arrived at without the spilling of blood.''
   Such doubts stem from the disinclination of loyalist troops to
fire on rebels during the uprsing, and the maintenance of army bases
in rebel hands after the insurrrection was declared over Sunday by
the government.
   After the April 1987 insurrection led by cashiered Lt. Col. Aldo
Rico, three-quarters of the army's top generals were retired, and
legislation was passed that limited the prosecution of officers for
rights abuses.
   Alfonsin also declared then that rebels had surrendered
unconditionally.

   Someday, shoppers at a mall may enter a computer
booth to pay a parking ticket or utility bill, register to vote or
check on garbage pickup times, municipal officials say.
   ``The key thing is to make it easier for people to get
information about their government at a place and time convenient to
them,'' Kansas City, Mo., City Councilor John A. Sharp said Tuesday.
``We still operate at the convenience of the bureaucracy, not at the
convenience of citizens.''
   Residents can't yet pay parking tickets or apply for building
permits by computer, but in Kansas City, Charlotte, N.C., and
Hillsborough County, Fla., they can receive a wide array of
electronic information about government services and operations.
   The two cities and the county are taking part in a computer-based
pilot program that gives people easier access to local government,
officials said at the National League of Cities convention Tueday.
   The project's cost was not released.
   Computerized communications between residents and government may
seem impersonal, but officials said the technology is a convenient,
efficient way to provide more, better information.
   Using equipment donated by International Business Machines Inc.,
the three jurisdictions made the information services available this
year. The project was organized by Public Technology Inc. of
Washington, the league's non-profit research and development arm.
   In Kansas City, computer kiosks with a color screen that displays
information and pictures have been set up in two malls for about a
year, connected directly to city hall.
   Residents can touch a screen and get information on recreational
events, licenses and permits, complaints about police, traffic or
trash pickup; neighborhood services; government meetings; or city
jobs. The computers have averaged 700 touches daily, and are on line
15 hours a day.
   In a survey of the computer users, more than half said they had
never been to city hall for the kind of information available in the
computer. During a one-month period, requests for information on
recreational events totaled 1,880, compared with 398 complaints.
   ``We'll be where they do business,'' said Sandra Charbonier,
citizen action center manager for Hillsborough County, which
includes Tampa. ``They won't have to come to where we do business.''
   Charlotte established a telephone system in which people calling
some city hall departments hear recorded messages that direct them
to press numbers to select specific information or record a message
of their own. The result has been better response time from
officials such as building inspectors who get messages from
contractors.
   ``Not everyone is willing to accept one-way communication for
information,'' said Boyd Cauble, executive assistant to the city
manager. ``I see the system (being made) available to pay bills by
entering credit card numbers, getting permits, exchanging
information. All this requires a tremendous amount of refinement of
the system and a tremendous amount of public education.''

<HEAD>Six-Year U.S. Ban On Sale Of Cluster Weapons Lifted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has lifted a six-year ban on
U.S. export of cluster bombs to Israel on the understanding that the
weapons will not be used against civilian targets.
   The decision was denounced by Ambassador Clovis Maksoud, the
League of Arab Nations' representative in the United States, who
called it ``shocking,'' ``very provocative'' and ``sickening.''
   Reagan banned the sale of such munitions to Israel after that
country used them against civilian target areas in Lebanon in
violation of Israeli assurances to the United States.
   State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman said Tuesday that
because ``the issue of usage has been resolved pursuant to the terms
of the recent understanding'' barring use against civilians, ``we
see no reason to prohibit Israel's access to these weapons which can
contribute to Israel's security.''

it reported in the 1988 fiscal year.
   Final figures for fiscal 1988, which ended in October, were

   MCI Communications Corp., the nation's second
largest long-distance telephone company, announced a package of
price cuts that include a 3.9 percent reduction in basic interstate
long-distance rates.
   The announcement by Washington-based MCI on Tuesday came six days
after industry leader American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and No. 3
US Sprint Communications Corp. announced cuts averaging 3.8 percent
and 3.85 percent, respectively.
   MCI said it was passing on savings that result from a lowering of
access charges that it pays to local telephone companies. It said
the reduction effective Jan. 1 means MCI will have dropped its rates
36 percent since the breakup of the Bell System in 1984.

   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is
counseling President-elect George Bush to reject calls for Pentagon
budget cuts as ``inefficient and dangerous.''
   Members of Congress who call for defense reductions say little
``about overseas threats or `military realities' which do not
conform to their version of political reality,'' Adm. William J.
Crowe Jr., the joint chiefs chairman, said Tuesday.
   Crowe said in a speech he wants to help improve Pentagon
management and to convince Congress that stable financing instead of
peak-and-valley cycles could save huge amounts of money.
   Crowe said that while changes may be called for, ``it would be a
grievous _ and probably, ultimately disabling _ error to undertake
those adjustments with an eye only to the concerns of accountants.''

   The City Council has decided to allow
kids in this city once known as ``Goat Hill'' and won't evict Barney
Junior, a 90-pound pygmy goat.
   Barney's owner, Angela Raj Kumar, had been told that the goat
would have to go because city codes prohibited barnyard animals in
back yards, and a neighbor had complained.
   But she circulated a petition among her neighbors in support of
Barney and submitted it to the council. It asked that the goat be
allowed to stay in the city, whose newsletter is called ``The Goat
Hill Gazette.''
   Raj Kumar pleaded her case before the council Monday night, and,
to make her point, marched Barney into council chambers.
   ``A lot of people are not really informed on animals. We're so
city oriented,'' she said. ``When a goat is fixed, there is no
smell.''
   Former Mayor Norma Hertzog-Wagner spoke on behalf of Barney.
   ``We shouldn't be so pristine that we lose touch,'' she said.
``We should all have kids around all of the time.''
   The council agreed, voting 4-1 to allow some barnyard animals
into the city's back yards with proper permits.

   While the leaders of the two superpowers
discuss peace a few miles away in New York City, croquet players and
lawn bowlers in Greenwich are toasting their new truce.
   Ending four months of sometimes negotiations, representatives of
the Greenwich Croquet Club and the Greenwich Lawn Bowls Club
announced Monday that they will share the lawns at the town's Bruce
Park.
   ``They deserve a lot of credit for working it out,'' Parks and
Recreation Director Frank Keegan said. ``I'm thrilled that it came
to a happy conclusion.''
   Standing on the bowling green at the park Monday, croquet players
Fred Supper, Norman ``Topper'' Cook, David Caulkins and William
Campbell joined lawn bowler leader Charles Morgan at his sport. And
Morgan took a few whacks with a mallet.
   The lawn bowlers have had exclusive use of the green since the
1940s.
   The proposal by the croquet group to share the park began in
August, when Supper's wife, Patricia, presented the Board of
Selectmen with a petition with about 100 signatures asking for
approval to share the field.
   Ensuing negotiations led to the settlement. But as recently as
October, Morgan said the position of his group was, ``there's a
possibility that croquet could exist.''
   As part of the agreement, the lawn bowlers will reserve a 50-foot
wide section of the green for two hours every afternoon. The rest of
the 70-by-120-foot green will be available for croquet at the same
time. Croquet may also be played after 3 p.m. The mornings were
aside for maintenance.

<HEAD>U.S.-based Human Rights Group Alleges Abuses In Israel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israel has jailed human rights workers for
months and violated international law by transporting Palestinians
detained without trial to a desert camp inside Israel, a U.S.-based
human rights group charged today.
   The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights made the allegations in a
95-page report that features testimony from six Palestinian lawyers
and human rights workers as well as interviews with Israeli
officials.
   The report accuses Israel of arresting Palestinian human rights
workers on secret charges and outlines Israeli abuses in the Ketziot
prison established during the year-long Palestinian revolt against
Israeli's 21-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``Ketziot's location in a remote part of Israel proper, its
extremely harsh desert climate and its crowded, inhumane living
conditions combine to create an untenable environment in which to
maintain long-term detainees,'' the report by the New York-based
group says.
   ``The detention of residents of the occupied territories in
Israel proper is contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention.'' The
1949 convention states that detainees in an occupied country may not
be moved to another country.
   Ketziot, where more than 2,000 detainees from the West Bank and
Gaza are believed held, is in the heart of Israel's southern Negev
desert.
   Last week, Ketziot inmates staged a two-day hunger strike. Arab
reports said the strike was to protest harsh prison conditions. On
Tuesday, Palestinians staged a general strike in the occupied lands
in solidarity with the detainees.
   The Lawyers Committee report alleges that Arabs are routinely
forced to stand in the sweltering desert heat for hours, water
supplies are inadequate and prisoners are sometimes beaten.
   Ketziot inmates made similar complaints when an Associated Press
reporter visited the prison in June.
   The report quotes Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron as
saying the location may be a ``contradiction'' of the Geneva
Convention, but that Israel has ``the right to transfer prisoners
into a sovereign part'' of the country.
   Shomron also said the army is trying to improve conditions at the
prison, but that conditions are harsh.
   ``It's not a hotel,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The report says four Palestinian fieldworkers for Al-Haq, an
Arab-run human rights group based in the occupied West Bank, were
detained for over six months on secret charges: ``The administrative
detention without charge of four Al-Haq fieldworkers is a serious
blow to independent human rights monitoring in the West Bank.''
   The report alleges that Israel circumvents the legal process by
routinely detaining Palestinians on the basis of secret evidence:
``The ... secret evidence is not made available to detainees or
their lawyers and therefore can not be effectively challenged by
counsel.''
   An army spokesman said he had not yet received the report and
could not comment on its findings.
   Al-Haq issued a report Monday challenging Israeli claims that the
army was using lawful measures to quell the rebellion, in which 319
Palestinians and 11 Israelis have died since last Dec. 8.
   The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights was established in 1978
and has investigated human rights abuses in more than 25 countries.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Against Yen, Shares Hit Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese yen
Wednesday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
sharply to a record high as the key index closed about 30,000 for
the first time.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 54.70 points for
a record closing high the previous day, added another 381.44 points
or 1.29 percent to finish trading at 30,050.82 yen.
   The dollar closed at 122.43 yen, up 0.89 yen from Tuesday's close
of 121.54 yen. Opening at 121.82 yen, the currency gradually rose
while ranging between 121.82 yen and 122.60 yen. It was the first
time that the dollar rose back beyond the 122-yen mark since Nov.
29, when it finished at 122.15 yen.
   Traders said the dollar's strength stemmed from speculation that
the United States and the Soviet Union would reach agreement on
reducing conventional military forces during Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's visit to New York.
   ``The dollar began rising gradually after the opening, and
participants continued to buy after it reached the 122-yen level,''
said a currency dealer at the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   He said recent bearish sentiment toward the dollar on the Tokyo
market had declined because of the upcoming U.S.-Soviet summit talks
in New York.
   Gorbachev is scheduled to meet with President Reagan and to
address the U.N. General Assembly.
   The dollar's upturn in Tokyo also followed news indicating that
the U.S. budget deficit may be reduced, currency dealers said.
   Michael Boskin, chosen by President-elect George Bush to be his
chief economic adviser, reportedly said Bush will ``take strong
action on the deficit on the spending side of the budget.''
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices rose mainly because of
an overnight gain in the Dow Jones industrial average in New York,
dealers said.
   Stock investors also were encouraged by the announcement Tuesday
of a 2.2 percent gain in the Japanese gross national product in the
third quarter over the previous three-month period, dealers said.
The GNP rose 9.3 percent on an annual basis during the quarter.

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials have predicted for months that
Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev would announce a unilateral cut
in Soviet troops in Eastern Europe, a move that could reap public
relations profits for Moscow and allow it to divert money into
domestic programs.
   A number of Soviet and American officials thought Gorbachev would
use his speech before the United Nations General Assembly today to
announce a decision by the ruling Politburo to go ahead with the
cuts, which have been opposed by senior Red Army generals.
   Following the Sept. 30 Politburo shakeup that strengthened
Gorbachev's hand, the ruling body agreed to cuts in the armed
forces, which currently number 5.6 million men and women, according
to published reports in the Washington Post and New York Times.
   The cuts are most likely in Eastern Europe, where the Soviets
have about 500,000 troops, and along the Soviet border with China.
   Gorbachev and his aides have been hinting at such reductions in
what they describe as a new military doctrine of ``reasonable
sufficiency,'' based on an ability to defend against attack rather
than to mount a major offensive.
   Many U.S. officials thought Gorbachev would announce troop cuts
during the most recent summit, last May in Moscow.
   But senior military officials, led by the chief of staff, Marshal
Sergei Akhromeyev, have opposed any decrease in Soviet forces
without a reduction by the West.
   ``In accordance with the new defensive doctrine, we are beginning
to introduce some changes in organizational structure of the Soviet
Armed Forces, in order to impart a defensive nature to the armed
forces, but this will demand some time,'' Akhromeyev said during a
visit last July to the Pentagon.
   ``The complete realization of the changes bears on bilateral
steps,'' he said. ``Therefore we must sit at the negotiating table
and address the outstanding issues between us,'' he said in a
statement clearly aimed at discouraging speculation of any
unilateral Soviet cuts.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and other senior U.S.
officials have been watching Soviet statements closely, but say they
have not yet seen any changes in the size, armaments and deployment
of the Red Army.
   Red Army generals also opposed similar cuts in their forces made
in the mid-1950s by then-Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev.
   The Kremlin could gain from unilateral troop cuts in Eastern
Europe and along the Chinese border.
   Such a move would improve the atmosphere for a spring summit
scheduled between Gorbachev and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, and
would further enhance the popularity of Gorbachev in Western Europe,
where he is already regarded more favorably than is Reagan,
according to U.S. government polls.
   Cutting conventional forces also could yield economic benefits
for Gorbachev, whose government admitted this year for the first
time that it was facing a budget deficit.

   About 20 percent of Venezuela's
registered voters ignored stiff penalties and abstained from casting
ballots in this week's national elections, authorities said.
   The projected abstention rate in Sunday's national election was
the highest ever in Venezuela's 30-year democracy, according to the

   Penalties for not voting include six-month bans on foreign
travel, public sector employment, university registration and
registering trademarks, according to the Law of Suffrage.
   President-elect Carlos Andres Perez of the center-left Democratic

compared to ``normal'' abstention of 25 to 30 percent in democratic
nations.
   ``In U.S. elections around 50 percent of the electorate votes,
but that doesn't mean Americans don't want democracy. I do not think
there is any weariness of any sort with the (democratic) system,''
he said.

   A 17-month FBI ``sting'' had Colombian drug-cartel
point men using a phony electronics company as a clubhouse, leading
to indictments of 93 people and leaving traffickers wondering, ``who
do you trust?,'' authorities say.
   About half of the suspects were in custody Tuesday in Boston,
Houston, Los Angeles, Tampa and Miami, and many were expected to
surrender later, the FBI said. Among those arrested were a Latin
recording star and two former Miami police officers.
   The sting, nicknamed ``Cat-Com'' for Catch Communications, also
allowed federal agents to seize about 5 tons of cocaine, 100 tons of
marijuana and some heroin, authorities said.
   R.A. Communications and Computers Inc. ``essentially was used as
a clubhouse or a meeting place for first-line drug traffickers
associated with the Medellin and Cali cartels,'' said William Perry,
South Florida's acting FBI director.
   He said the traffickers, who were indicted by federal grand
juries in Miami and Tampa, were ``top-of-the-line'' U.S. contacts
for drug lords Pablo Escobar Gaviria, Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasquez and
Jose Gonzalo Rodrigues Gacha, who operate in the Colombian towns of
Medellin or Cali.
   The indictments send a message that drug smugglers can never be
sure who they're dealing with, said U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   ``Everything they do in the United States is subject to come back
to haunt them,'' Lehtinen said.
   ``They might have bought their ice cream from an undercover
agent, they might have bought their communications from an
undercover agent.''
   Unsuspecting traffickers became so trusting of the staff at the
Hialeah electronics company that they talked openly about the
narcotics trade, Perry said.
   The company, which was closed following Tuesday's indictments,
sold high-tech equipment to them and soon was arranging
communications that allowed the suspects to talk directly by two-way
radio to smuggling ships and their bosses in Colombia, authorities
said. Only a few of the company's customers were not involved in
drug trafficking, said FBI officials.
   As the traffickers relaxed in a comfortable lounge at the
company, FBI agents and government sources recorded every
conversation with hidden video and audio equipment, Perry said.
   At one point the middlemen even asked the agents to check
properties for electronic bugs, the FBI said.
   The investigation was the ``largest undercover operation ever
directed toward the inter-workings of the drug cartels,'' FBI
Director William Sessions said in Washington, D.C.
   More than $1 million in cash and property has been seized and
total seizures are expected to exceed $4 million, said the FBI
director.
   One of those arrested Tuesday was Raul Alfonso, 39, part of the
popular salsa group Hansel and Raul. Alfonso was charged with
conspiracy to import cocaine and importation of cocaine with intent
to distribute the drug, authorities said.
   Alfonso denied the charges as he and other defendants were loaded
onto a bus at FBI headquarters in North Miami Beach.
   The former police officers, Jorge Luis Canizares and Ramon de
Jesus Perez, were arrested Monday night near R.A. Communications
after buying 6 kilograms of cocaine, authorities said. They had been
out on bond on other drug charges when they were arrested.
   The FBI and other agencies, including the Drug Enforcement
Administration, Customs Service, Coast Guard and local agencies, had
to walk a thin line on the case to both keep the traffickers'
confidence and enforce the U.S. policy of not allowing any drugs to
be imported, even in an undercover operation.
   Information from the sting allowed Navy and Coast Guard vessels
to intercept the drugs, usually in 500-kilogram amounts, before they
reached the United States from South America.
   In one instance, the drug traffickers hired a sailboat named
Naut-For-Fun, piloted by FBI sources, to carry nearly 900 pounds of
cocaine from Colombia.
   The FBI had planned to seize the drugs covertly and tell the
traffickers the sailboat had sunk with the crew lost at sea. Then
bad weather hit and the boat was sunk. The Coast Guard rescued those
aboard and recovered the cocaine.

   More human rights workers were killed or
suffered persecution in countries under freely elected leaders than
in dictatorships of either the left or the right, according to a
survey of abuse cases.
   The most violence directed against those trying to preserve human
rights during the past year came in the 3-year-old democracy of the
Philippines, while the Soviet Union showed some of the greatest
progress in support of human rights, said the 217-page report
released Tuesday by Human Rights Watch.
   The report for 1988 documented 750 cases of persecution against
people monitoring human rights in 61 countries, including 30
killings or deaths under detention, three disappearances and 16
killings of people associated with human rights monitors. The number
of deaths was more than triple that found in the first such survey
last year, but officials said the higher figures reflect increased
human rights activity rather than increased repression.
   ``The country which unfortunately looms largest in terms of
violence to human rights monitors is the Philippines,'' said Aryeh
Neier, Human Rights Watch executive director, at a news conference.
   Nine of the deaths and two of the disappearances were in the
Philippines. Columbia led a similar survey last year as the most
dangerous country for pursuing human rights.
   Neier said President Corazon Aquino's overthrow of 20-year ruler
Ferdinand Marcos in February 1986 brought hope for change, but new
civilian governments often are ``either too weak or lack the
political will'' to protect their people against abuses by the
military and other forces.
   ``The largest number of cases do not take place in dictatorships
of either the right or the left who seem able to maintain control
without resorting to extreme forms of violence against human rights
monitors,'' Neier said.
   Other countries with elected civilian governments and serious
human rights problems include Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras, Peru and Sri Lanka, said Neier, director of the
group which includes Americas Watch, Asia Watch and Helsinki Watch.
It also is setting up Africa Watch and Middle East Watch to document
and combat human rights abuses in those regions.
   In both years covered by the group, the largest number of
persecutions _ not necessarily leading to death _ were in South
Africa, Chile, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, the report said.
   The report said Israel, which was not included in last year's
report, made the 1988 survey because of ``the efforts of the Israeli
authorities to suppress information about human rights abuses in the
context of the uprising in the Occupied Territories.''
   However, Neier cautioned that the number of reported incidents
against human rights workers in any country cannot be used as an
index of general repression, because many countries are too
repressive to allow any monitoring. He listed North Korea, Saudi
Arabia, Iraq, Albania and Ethiopia as countries where human rights
workers cannot operate.
   Much of this year's section on the Soviet Union dealt with
releases of human rights monitors from detention, rather than with
persecution. But Neier said he did not consider any country heroic
simply because it did not abuse people working to protect human
rights.
   ``The only heroes are the human rights monitors,'' he said.
   In its first report last year, the group counted 10 deaths and
two disappearances related to human rights work throughout the
world. Five other deaths were discovered later and added to the 1987
totals.
   Neier said abuse cases increased primarily because human rights
monitoring has increased and spread into rural areas.
   Increased abuses were reported in Cuba primarily because of
increased international attention to human rights in the island
nation, he said.

<HEAD>Governors Praise Court's National Guard Ruling; Feds Consider Next

   Two governors praised a U.S. appeals court
ruling upholding their right to veto National Guard training
missions. But the author of the law that had denied them that
authority said the ruling was disturbing.
   ``The court's decision restores the effective balance between the
state and federal governments with regard to authority over the
National Guard,'' Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, who had challenged
the law, said in a statement released by his office Tuesday.
   Responding to Perpich's challenge, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled 2-1 Tuesday that the law is unconstitutional.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, whose state lost a similar
challenge in the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in October,
called the ruling a ``victory for common sense, the Constitution and
the governors of the United States.''
   But Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., who wrote the
so-called Montgomery Amendment taking away governors' control over
Guard units, said the ruling could hamper the Guard's effectiveness.
   ``If 50 governors are allowed to veto Guard missions because they
don't like the way our foreign policy is administered, it would have
an adverse impact on training and would raise questions about the
availability of the Guard to meet its considerable defense
responsibilities,'' he said.
   Because the decision conflicted with the 1st Circuit's previous
ruling, the matter may have to be decided by the Supreme Court. In
the meantime, federal officials said, the ruling will not
immediately affect Guard training.
   Perpich and Dukakis said Tuesday's ruling reaffirms
constitutionally guaranteed states' rights. Ohio, Colorado, Vermont
and Maine also supported the Minnesota lawsuit.
   ``The Montgomery Amendment went too far in tipping the balance of
power toward the federal government,'' said Perpich, who was
vacationing in Hawaii.
   Dukakis, the unsuccessful Democratic presidential nominee, also
criticized what he said was the Reagan administration's policy of
using Guard troops in Central America to destabilize Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista regime. ``That policy has been a failure,'' he
said in Boston.
   His state's effort to block the use of Massachusetts Guard units
in Central America was criticized by Vice President George Bush
during the presidential campaign.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon said his state now
is more likely to appeal the ruling in its case.
   The 8th Circuit majority concluded that the Montgomery Amendment
contravenes the intent of the framers of the U.S. Constitution, who
they said designed the militia _ now the National Guard _ ``to serve
as a check on the potential abuse of military power by the federal
government.''
   ``The government has not demonstrated that the effectiveness of
either the national defense or the National Guard will be diminished
by adherence to the constitutional principle of basic state control
over National Guard forces, absent a declaration of war or national
exigency,'' the majority said in an 80-page opinion.
   The ruling reversed an August 1987 decision by U.S. District
Judge Donald Alsop of Minnesota.
   Amy Brown, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice in
Washington, said the ruling only affects states in the 8th Circuit:
Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and
South Dakota. The ruling does not take effect immediately, she said,
and probably would be put on hold if the government appeals.
   Dan Donohue, a spokesman for the National Guard Bureau in
Washington, suggested further legal action is likely because of the
conflicting appeals court decisions. ``But no decisions have been
made officially on an appeal,'' he said.
   ``The Montgomery Amendment is still the law of the land except in
the affected case,'' Donohue said.``We will continue to deploy and
train soldiers in accordance with the federal law.''
   Nationally, about 115,000 men and women serve in the Air National
Guard and an additional 460,000 serve in the Army National Guard,
Donohue said.
   The Pentagon is planning to send about 6,000 Guard members from
across the country to Honduras during 1989 for road-building and
engineering exercises, Donohue said.

   Hundreds of police who sealed off the Soviet
Mission for Mikhail Gorbachev's visit didn't deter protesters or
other bystanders, including a ``Gorby'' look-alike who briefly
fooled the media and Donald Trump.
   When the real Soviet leader arrived Tuesday at the mission on
Manhattan's fashionable Upper East Side, he waved from his limousine
at the crowds. The car then disappeared into a ramp to an
underground garage.
   But 30 minutes before Gorbachev's arrival, Ronald V. Knapp caused
a bigger commotion among the hundreds of people milling through
nearby streets.
   Knapp, the spitting image of Gorbachev down to what looked like a
wine-colored birthmark on his head, drove up a block away from the
mission in a silver stretch limousine. As confused media members
scrambled for their cameras and notepads, Knapp stood on the corner
speaking through an interpreter.
   The message from the interpreter was simple: He distributed
business cards informing everyone how they could hire Knapp by
contacting his agent.
   Later, two groups totaling about 200 people gathered at the
corner closest to the sealed-off block in front of the mission,
where Gorbachev is staying during his three-day visit, to chant,
sing and make speeches.
   The larger group, of Armenian-Americans, was protesting
Gorbachev's handling of ethnic unrest in Azerbaijan and Armenia. A
smaller group of Jews protested Soviet emigration policy.
   ``We want to let the Soviets know that we are concerned about
human rights,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who came to the
Armenian rally at the request of the organizers.
   The mission showed no apparent acknowledgment of the protests,
and there was no glimpse of Gorbachev.
   In fact, his look-alike, who caused commotions all around
Manhattan, was as close as anyone got to seeing the Soviet leader
for most of Tuesday.
   When Knapp strolled past Tiffany's in midafternoon, greeting
shoppers with a Russian-sounding ``Hi,'' hundreds crowded around _
perhaps remembering the Soviet leader's impromptu appearance on a
Washington, D.C., street during last year's summit.
   The impersonator's act was apparently good enough to fool real
estate tycoon Donald Trump, who recently learned that Gorbachev had
turned down a chance to visit the developer's glittering Trump Tower.
   Trump, accompanied by bodyguards, rushed down from his nearby
office and pushed his way through the crowd for a chance to pump the
hand of the world leader.
   ``He looked fabulous and he sounded fabulous, but I knew it
couldn't be right,'' Trump said. ``For one thing, I looked into the
back of his limo and saw four very attractive women.
   ``I knew that his society had not come that far yet in terms of
capitalist decadence.''
   Businessmen in the Upper East Side neighborhood of the mission
had mixed feelings about the effects of the Gorbachev visit, which
includes a speech before the United Nations today, followed by a
meeting with President Reagan and President-elect George Bush.
   Gerald Gibson, manager of the Le Laurier restaurant around the
corner from the Soviet Mission, invited Gorbachev to lunch. Despite
getting no reply, he remained unfazed.
   ``If he's too busy for lunch, he can come for dinner,'' Gibson
said.
   At the 68th Street Playhouse, a block from the Soviet mission,
the movie theater manager said the crowds hadn't helped business.
   ``All it's going to do is cause a lot of traffic jams,'' said the
manager, who declined to give his name. ``All these police, and she
(Raisa Gorbachev) wants to shop in Bloomingdale's?''
   But Officer George Charles dismissed the grumbling of Christmas
shoppers who complained about the added traffic.
   ``This is for world peace,'' Charles said. ``If you don't have
that, you can forget about your shopping.''

   Atlantis' astronauts returned home under a cover
of darkness early today, a fitting finale to their secret space
mission during which they reportedly launched a powerful spy
satellite into orbit over the Soviet Union.
   Atlantis, bruised a lot more than usual, streaked out of orbit
Tuesday, completing a four-day space voyage with an unusual
afternoon landing on a packed clay runway at Edwards Air Force Base
in California's Mojave Desert.
   The military mission, the second shuttle flight since Challenger
exploded 34 months ago, was believed to have included deployment of
a sophisticated satellite that can peer through clouds and darkness
to spy on the Soviets.
   The five astronauts' low-key, middle-of-the-night arrival here
seemed an appropriate ending to the classified flight, which had
been shrouded in secrecy since it launched Friday from Cape
Canaveral, Fla.
   Despite the crew's 12:50 a.m. arrival, more than 200 people were
there to cheer the astronauts and their wives when they stepped off
two planes. In contrast, some 5,000 flag-waving spectators greeted
the evening return of Discovery's crew in October.
   Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson, who guided the 97-ton shuttle to a
centerline touchdown Tuesday, was surprised at the early-morning
turnout.
   ``I can't believe all of you are out here at one o'clock in the
morning,'' he said. ``This is incredible. I expected just a hop in
the cars and go.''
   ``It really was a great flight,'' said Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S.
Gardner, who made his first trip into space as Atlantis' pilot. ``I
think we did a good job for NASA and the space program and think we
did some good things for our country.''
   After making a few brief remarks to the crowd, the astronauts
shook hands with other astronauts and Johnson Space Center employees
and then left with their families in vans.
   The other crew members were Col. Richard M. Mullane and Lt. Col.
Jerry L. Ross of the Air Force and Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd.
   Before Tuesday's 3:35 p.m. PST landing, NASA and the Air Force
only broke their silence twice _ to say the crew could proceed with
operations and to give 24-hour notice on the landing time.
   Mission Control then lifted its curtain of secrecy about an hour
before landing to report, as it was happening, that Gibson had fired
braking rockets to slow the spaceship's 17,400-mph speed by 283 mph
and drop it out of orbit onto an hourlong fiery descent through the
atmosphere.
   Atlantis landed with a slow leak in a tire on its landing gear
that NASA previously had said was not a concern. The leak did not
seem to affect the smoothness of the touchdown.
   As the astronauts and several officials of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration inspected the shuttle, some
damage could be seen to the underside, including ``dings'' in the
black protective tiles. The tiles shown by NASA cameras ``appeared
to be a lot more damaged than usual,'' said NASA spokeswoman Nancy
Lovato.
   The landing was closed to the public because of the flight's
classified nature, leaving only a few hundred journalists, invited
guests and NASA employees to watch. Some 425,000 spectators
witnessed Discovery's landing.
   Atlantis' flight was the 27th shuttle mission and the longest of
three trips dedicated entirely to military purposes, lasting 4 days,
9 hours and 5 minutes.
   Sources said Atlantis' primary goal _ to deploy the spy satellite
_ was accomplished during the weekend. The sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the $500 million Lacrosse satellite was
operating well in an orbit that allows it to make radar pictures of
80 percent of the Soviet Union.
   Lacrosse is said to be designed to help American intelligence
agencies monitor Soviet compliance with arms control treaties and to
eventually serve as the ``radar eye'' for the new B-2 stealth bomber.
   The afternoon landing was only the fourth for a shuttle. NASA
prefers morning landings at Edwards because winds tend to kick up
after noon.
   A NASA official said he assumed the afternoon landing was
required by the shuttle's orbit. Deploying a spy satellite to fly
over much of the Soviet Union would require a high-inclination orbit
in which Atlantis zig-zagged far north and south of the equator as
it circled Earth.
   The shuttle will remain at the base for several days of servicing
before it is mounted on a modified jumbo jetliner for a piggyback
ride home to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The astronauts
have today off.

<HEAD>Rabin Eulogizes Iran-Contra Player Who Died In Mysterious Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Israeli official who was
involved in the Iran-Contra affair and died in a mysterious plane
crash in Mexico was eulogized by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin as a
man of integrity who ``lived in a storm.''
   Amiram Nir, 38, was buried Tuesday at a suburban Tel Aviv
cemetery.
   Cabinet ministers, Nir's former colleagues and hundreds others
attended the funeral.
   Nir, born Amiram Nisker to a family of Holocaust survivors, was a
paratrooper and military broadcasting correspondent before becoming
adviser on counterterrorism to two Israeli prime ministers.
   In the Iran-Contra affair, he worked closely with U.S. officials
and made trips to Europe and Iran.
   Nir resigned to become a private businessman earlier this year.
In Mexico, where he died last Wednesday, Nir said he was an avocado
exporter.
   Investigators cast doubt on the report because of Nir's past and
because he used an assumed name when renting the plane in which he
was killed.
   ``Amiram lived in a storm and died in a storm,'' Rabin said in
his eulogy at the Kiryat Shaul cemetery. ``His missions led him to
mysterious destinations and to veiled affairs, to deep secrets he
knew how to keep.''
   ``When the shroud of secrecy was suddenly torn from this
anonymous soldier ... he became a focus of international interest,''
Rabin said in reference to Iran-Contra. ``He knew how to grind his
teeth and sustain even when people tried to harm his good name.''
   Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev and Cabinet ministers Gad Yaacoby
and Yitzhak Modai were among the crowd. Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres was seen comforting Nir's mother Miriam, who later lost
consciousness during the funeral ceremony and was given medical
treatment.
   On Tuesday, the dailies Maariv and Hadashot carried an article
from the New York-based Newsday newspaper, alleging Nir kept in
contact with U.S. intelligence officials until his death.
   The report quoted intelligence sources as saying Nir may have
been involved in a large shipment of Israeli arms that arrived last
week in port of Veracruz.
   It said Mexico apparently decided to import Israeli weapons to
combat an increase in drug trafficking in the state of Michoacan
where Nir died.
   On Monday, an informed Israeli source told The Associated Press
the former government adviser was a licensed arms dealer. Israeli
officials and Nir's friends and former colleagues denied the claim.

   Representatives of at least 20 agencies from the
U.S. State Department to the city Fire Department have gathered
under one roof for one purpose: to keep Mikhail Gorbachev safe and
happy ``until he's put to bed.''
   ``We would define success as having nothing to do for the next
three days,'' police Deputy Inspector James Vitti said Tuesday, as
the Soviet president began his three-day visit to New York City.
   The command center at Police Headquarters is in a large room
containing two long tables with banks of telephones and a
26-by-10-foot video screen on the wall.
   In addition to the dozen or so police officials, more than 20
other agencies operate there, including the FBI, the Secret Service,
the Coast Guard, the State Department, the Federal Aviation
Administration, the Fire Department, the city's traffic department
and ambulance corps.
   The brain center is in operation until midnight on each day of
Gorbachev's visit or until ``he's put to bed at the Soviet
Mission,'' Vitti said.
   ``The premise is that we have one location where people who can
speak for their agencies are available to cope with any potential
problem that may develop,'' Vitti said. ``It's an assembly of people
who are problem-solvers.''
   Few authorities could conceive of a greater problem than if the
ebullient Gorbachev indulges his penchant for mingling with street
crowds. Most, however, were confident of the Soviet leader's safety.
   ``We have 6,000 cops out there and he's safe in this city, as
safe as anyone can be,'' Mayor Edward I. Koch said on ABC-TV's
``Nightline.'' ``Obviously, there are nuts all around the world. But
I believe we don't have a full moon and it's going to be OK.''
   On Tuesday, the command center officials watched local television
coverage of Gorbachev's arrival on the video screen and several
other television sets in the room.
   The center, which is in constant contact with agents and officers
in the field, was called upon at least three times before Gorbachev
and his wife, Raisa, were safely delivered to the Soviet Mission in
Manhattan from Kennedy International Airport.
   The first call came before their arrival when motorists on the
Long Island Expressway became impatient with detours and drove up on
the grass to avoid roadblocks.
   This problem went to police officials who dispatched extra
patrols to the area to turn back the motorists.
   Another traffic problem arose on the Van Wyck Expressway in
Queens when a propane truck broke down in a southbound lane before
it was to be closed for Gorbachev's motorcade.
   The representative for the city Transportation Department at the
command center ordered the immediate dispatch of a tow truck, which
removed the disabled vehicle 10 minutes before Gorbachev left the
airport.
   As the motorcade traveled down the Grand Central Parkway in
Queens, another call came in _ a private helicopter hired by a news
organization was hovering too close to the procession of 45 cars.
   The FAA representative notified the closest air control tower and
the helicopter was told to pull back.
   When the motorcade arrived at the Soviet Mission, another police
official, Lt. Vincent Kennedy, remarked with relief, ``As an old
friend of mine used to say, it went like ice cream. No problems.''

   A senior Soviet official says there are no
plans for Soviet-style economic reforms to be imposed on Communist
Cuba, the island nation's official news agency reported.
   Victor Kompletkov, Soviet deputy foreign minister, made his
statements Tuesday at the press center for Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, who is to arrive in the Soviet client state Friday for a
three-day visit.
   Kompletkov's comments were carried Tuesday by the Prensa Latina
news agency, which was monitored in Mexico.
   On Monday, the 32nd anniversary of the landing of the yacht that
carried Cuban leader Fidel Castro from Mexico to launch the
revolution against dictator Fulgencio Batista, Castro said he would
defend the Cuban form of socialism against friend and foe, Prensa
Latina reported.
   Castro said some of Cuba's problems have been caused by its own
errors, but that others were caused by imitating other socialist
countries.
   Kompletkov said the political and economic reforms Gorbachev has
championed apply to conditions only in the Soviet Union and are not
intended for other countries, the report said.
   Nevertheless, Gorbachev is expected during his visit to encourage
Castro to follow the Soviet model of encouraging individual
initiative by enabling enterprises to make profits and by allowing
people to launch private cooperatives.
   Castro has been cool to such suggestions and has also been
unsympathetic to Gorbachev's policies of encouraging greater
openness of expression and a more competitive system of electing
party and government officials.

<TEXT>
   Iran-Contra prosecutors are narrowing the case
against Oliver L. North to try to undercut defense arguments that
government secrets must be disclosed to guarantee the former White
House aide a fair trial.
   Responding to President Reagan's refusal to release virtually any
of the secret documents North wants to disclose at trial,
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh conceded that some of the
operations financed by the U.S.-Iran arms-sale proceeds were legal.
   The prosecutor said he wouldn't contest the legality of spending
some of the proceeds from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to help drug
agents locate American hostages in Lebanon, purchase a Danish ship
for clandestine operations, buy radios for a foreign political group
and pay Nicaraguan rebel leaders.
   ``The government is willing to concede, for the purposes of this
case, that this group of expenditures went to programs otherwise
lawful'' but not authorized as part of Reagan's attempt to free
hostages by selling arms to Iran, Walsh said in a pleading released
late Tuesday in federal court.
   Walsh, however, maintained that there was still sufficient
evidence to prove that North conspired with former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Richard V. Secord and
Albert Hakim to defraud the government.
   The central conspiracy and theft-of-government property charges
against the former National Security Council aide and his
co-defendants, who are to be tried separately, stems from the
diversion of more than $14 million in arms-sale profits to the
Nicaraguan rebels, known as the Contras.
   North's ``deceitful acquisition'' of $18 million in profits from
the U.S.-Iran arms sales is ``the critical element of North's
behavior that makes it criminal,'' Walsh said.
   Instead of turning over the money to the U.S. government, North
placed it in secret Swiss bank accounts along with funds raised from
foreign countries and from private donors through a tax-exempt
foundation.
   ``Whether he used the diverted funds for ends that the government
could otherwise legitimately fund is irrelevant,'' the independent
prosecutor said. ``North's crime lies in how he acquired and
maintained control of these funds, not in the specific purposes for
which he spent them.''
   By conceding that some covert operations directed by North were
legal, particularly the Drug Enforcement Administration's efforts to
free American hostages in Lebanon, Walsh apparently hopes to
foreclose defense use of classified documents.
   The Reagan administration is particularly unwilling to divulge
any information that might compromise efforts to release the
hostages. Disclosure of such material could jeopardize the lives of
the hostages or subject them and others to torture, Walsh warned
earlier this year.
   The pleadings were filed at the request of U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell, who is conducting secret hearings on North's
objections to deleting classified material from 395 documents Walsh
wants to use as trial exhibits.
   Gesell must decide whether any of the secrets North wants to use
are relevant to his defense. If so, the Classified Information
Procedures Act provides for the dismissal of charges if the
government's refusal to release certain material prevents a
defendant from getting a fair trial.
   In addition to objecting to censoring prosecution exhibits, North
wants to disclose an additional 40,000 pages of secret documents.
   Walsh contended that North's use of classified documents ``to
demonstrate the bona fides of the programs supported by certain of
the proceeds of the Iranian arms sales is unjustified in light of
the government's theory of the case.''
   A separate pleading disclosed that prosecutors would rely heavily
on evidence that North personally supervised establishment of the
clandestine network to arm the Contras, ``in a way calculated to
defeat legal restrictions'' on such aid imposed by Congress.
   Walsh said there was evidence that by the summer of 1986, the
secret resupply operation employed 20 full-time employees and had a
monthly payroll of $60,000.
   Prosecutors have records showing that North spoke by telephone
with former CIA agent Joseph Fernandez more than 100 times between
August 1985 and November 1986 to direct a resupply operation, Walsh
said.
   Fernandez, identified as an unindicted co-conspirator, used a
KL-43 encryption device outside of normal CIA secure channels to
send messages to North about establishment of an airstrip in Costa
Rica for the resupply operation.
   Separate criminal charges against Fernandez, the CIA's station
chief in Costa Rica, were dismissed Oct. 19 following a
jurisdictional dispute. Walsh has indicated he will seek to obtain a
new indictment against Fernandez from a federal grand jury in
Virginia, which the defense contends is the only proper place to try
the case.

<HEAD>Gorbachev In New York, But Murder Trial Captures Attention</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During Mikhail Gorbachev's arrival here, local
programming was pre-empted _ but not only for the Soviet president.
New Yorkers also got to watch hours of live coverage of a murder
trial.
   When Hedda Nussbaum took the stand last week to testify against
her former live-in lover, Joel Steinberg, accused of beating to
death their illegally adopted 6-year-old daughter, Lisa, all three
network affiliates went live with the testimony. The networks have
pre-empted up to three hours a day of regular programming since.
   Cable channels have carried live trial coverage in the past,
notably CNN's coverage of the New Bedford, Mass., gang rape trial in
1984. But the Steinberg case seems to be the first time network
affiliates have pre-empted so much regular programming for such
coverage.
   ``This is compelling television in the best sense of the word,''
said Roger Colloff, general manager of WCBS-TV, which had carried
about 13 hours of live coverage of the trial since Nov. 30.
   ``This is not something being done by actors,'' Colloff said.
``This is a case with real and horrible consequences.''
   Last December, New York joined 43 others states when it enacted a
law allowing cameras in the courtroom under an 18-month experimental
period.
   In New York, judges can have veto camera coverage, and the
Steinberg case is the first trial of major interest in which the
judge has approved coverage during testimony.
   The death of Lisa in an affluent, well-educated household shocked
many New Yorkers and led to a re-examination of the duty and ability
of neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and report
evidence of child abuse.
   In two recent, highly publicized cases _ the Howard Beach racial
killing and the Robert Chambers murder trial _ the respective judges
allowed television coverage only during sentencing.
   ``I think it's the `new toy' kind of phenomenon,'' said Everette
E. Dennis, executive director of the Gannett Center for Media
Studies at Columbia University.
   ``This is the first time that the television stations have had an
opportunity to do this kind of live coverage. I do think it's a
passing show, unless the ratings are so high, higher than the soap
operas, that in an economic sense they (the stations) feel it's
warranted.''
   WABC-TV, which has the highest-rated soap operas, resumed regular
programming Monday. According to A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, trial
coverage was higher-rated on WNBC-TV and WCBS than the stations'
regularly scheduled soap operas.
   On Monday afternoon, trial coverage on WCBS had a rating of 5.2.
In the November sweeps _ key ratings periods that determine
advertising rates _ the station averaged a 3.1 for soap operas
airing during the same time period, and a 4.3 for a syndicated show
called ``On Trial.''
   On Tuesday, the networks pre-empted some programming for
Gorbachev's arrival. Coincidentally, there was no session in the
Steinberg trial scheduled for today, when the networks planned more
extensive live coverage of Gorbachev.
   Even though ratings have gone up, the trial coverage is
unsponsored, so stations lose ``many tens of thousands of dollars''
in advertising revenues, said Colloff. But there is a public
relations value to the coverage, along with a public service one.
   ``There really has been a reaction from people watching this
testimony which may be beneficial and may lead people to get out of
situations that they should be getting out of,'' Colloff said. ``I
don't want to sound to ethereal, but it actually may prevent another
Steinberg case from occurring.''
   The New York Times agreed in an editorial Tuesday: ``This drama
offers, beyond wallowing, a redeeming possibility: reliving on
television one child's terrible death can arouse in a large audience
the will to prevent the deaths of many others.''
   New York's chief administrative Judge Albert M. Rosenblatt, who
favored the new law, told the Times last month, ``The purpose of the
cameras in the courtroom experiment was to show the workings of the
justice system. The more people learn about the system, the more
confidence they'll have in it.''
   ``I think the overall effect is probably good,'' said Dennis.
``The more people are exposed to trials and nuances and questioning,
the better, even if it's fragmented. I'd rather have that than a few
highly sensational details.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advertising agency took out a full-page ad in
Russian in today's editions of The New York Times in an attempt to
open negotiations with Mikhail Gorbachev over his budding career as
a television pitchman.
   The Madison Avenue firm of Messner Vetere Berger Carey
Schmetterer wants to lure the Soviet leader into its offices with a
blank check for his inadvertant appearance in a Republican campaign
commercial, in which he is shown greeting George Bush.
   ``You, the Secretary General of the Soviet Union, were the star
of a major commercial in the George Bush campaign this fall and, as
an on-camera principal, are now due a pretty substantial sum of
money in talent payments,'' says the ad, which is written in Russian
and translated into English on the opposite page.
   If Gorbachev can produce a Screen Actors Guild card, he would be
due about $60,000 in talent fees for his appearance, said Ron
Berger, a partner in the firm.
   But since the Soviet leader is not a member of the union, his
compensation ``would be the subject of negotiation,'' Berger said.
   The ad makes no secret of its real reason for the appeal to
Gorbachev.
   ``We have immense experience selling upscale items. We can help
you sell Beluga caviar or help Stoli (Stolichnaya vodka) fight off
Absolut which has been eating into your market share,'' the ad says.
   The ad also offers Gorbachev the firm's services if he decides to
run for re-election.

<HEAD>Waldorf Chef Oversees Luncheon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   John Patrick Doherty, the man in the kitchen for
today's superpower luncheon, has cooked before for President Reagan,
who he said has personally complimented him on his cuisine.
   ``Last Wednesday, they asked me if I would be interested,'' said
Doherty, 30, a chef at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel for 11 years. ``I
submitted three menus for approval. ... They chose one on Friday. It
was great. I was very happy.''
   That menu for the meeting between Reagan, Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev and President-elect George Bush starts with chicken
consomme and the wild mushroom ravioli to start, followed by
tournedos of veal with smoked quail and lobster sausage, braised
cabbage and leeks, roesti potatoes (julienned and sauteed until
crisp) and sauteed fresh leaf spinach.
   The wine is a California chardonnay. Dessert features a chocolate
tart with almond cream cheese, fresh fruit and raspberry sauce.
   Doherty said it would take 14 people about four hours to prepare
the meal, under the watchful eye of Secret Service agents.
   The chef has cooked for Reagan before, because the president
generally stays at the Waldorf-Astoria when in New York. Twice,
Reagan has personally complimented Doherty on his cooking, Doherty
said.
   ``This style of cooking is what he prefers,'' he said. ``There
are some guidelines for keeping his health in mind. ... But I've
done this many times.''

   The effects of Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev's
travels in New York City are sending ripples across the Hudson
River, where New Jersey transportation companies fear a massive
stall.
   Henry Atwell, owner of the Kearny-based Schuyler Cab company,
said, ``If the traffic is too bad we won't even take people.
   ``It's not worth the fare to get a car stuck there for three or
four hours. We'll just tell them no and I think they'll understand.''
   About 540,000 people commute from New Jersey to New York City
each day.
   New Jersey Transit bus drivers are setting out from their

traffic gets too backed up on the West Side (of Manhattan),'' said
Tracy Munford, a spokeswoman for NJ Transit.
   Peter Farrell, a Wall Street broker and resident of suburban
Millburn, said he was not looking forward to the traffic mess.
   ``It's a lot of extra hassle, but I don't think my commuting

<TEXT>
   Fishermen have found the wreckage of a
World War II Japanese warplane and skeletal remains of its two
crewmen off a coastal village in the southern Philippines, a
Japanese official said today.
   Consul Kaisaku Kawamoto said in a telephone interview from Davao
City that the two-seater fighter plane `Geko' was found Nov. 15
about half a mile east of Talomo village in the province of Davao,
600 miles southeast of Manila.
   Fisherman Mario Calinao, 34, said one of the plane's engines,
radio communications equipment, four machine guns, a 20mm
anti-aircraft gun and revolvers had so far been recovered from the
wreckage.
   Calinao said a Filipino businessman in Davao had offered to pay
him if he could locate and refloat a Japanese warplane.
   ``I got interested in this because I was promised 30,000 pesos
($1,500) if I could refloat any Japanese warplane. I saw this plane.
When my friends learned about it, they offered to help. And since we
all needed the money, I said yes,'' Calinao told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview from the consulate office.
   Calinao said his group lifted the plane from a depth of about 140
feet by using metal drums filled with water. He said rubber hoses
were attached to them and water was pumped out.
   But Calinao said his hopes for new money dimmed because regional
military commander Col. Miguel Abaya had ordered operations to be
suspended and demanded that the objects be turned over to the
military.
   Kawamoto said he had asked the military to permit floating to
resume to enable Japanese embassy officials to identify the pilots.
No response has since been received.
   ``This plane is not Japanese property,'' Kawamoto said, ``I just
want to identify the names (of the pilots) and inform their
relatives and families.''
   He said Calinao brought him an ``old-styled fountain pen'' from
the wreckage with the inscribed name ``Ito.''

<TEXT>
   The Strategic Air Command lifted its
grounding of its aging fleet of B-52s imposed after the crash of a
bomber during a training flight that sent eight crewmen to the
hospital.
   The cause of early Tuesday's crash at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base
remained under investigation, said Capt. Paul Bicking, a spokesman
for the SAC base in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
   Seven of the crewmen remained hospitalized today, four in serious
condition, officials said.
   SAC grounded its fleet of about 260 B-52s as a precaution so
their fuel systems could be inspected. The grounding was lifted
Tuesday night and some of the bombers could be cleared to fly as
early as today, said Lt. Col. George Peck, a spokesman at SAC
headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Neb.
   Bicking said Sawyer's 20 B-52s would be ready to fly by the end
of the week.
   The B-52 broke into three parts about 1:15 a.m. EST Tuesday
during practice ``touch-and-go'' landings that followed a seven-hour
training flight, said Sgt. Naomi Siegel, a Sawyer spokeswoman. In a
touch-and-go, the plane immediately takes off again rather than
slowing down.
   No weapons were aboard the plane, which is equipped to carry
nuclear bombs, officials said.
   Four crewmen were treated at Marquette General Hospital and three
were transported to the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Medical
Center in Dayton, Ohio, Bicking said.
   The eighth crewman, 1st Lt. Gregory C. Smith, a 26-year-old
pilot, was released Tuesday from Sawyer's base hospital, Bicking
said.
   Maj. William R. Kroeger, 52, an instructor pilot was in serious
condition with chest injuries, said Marquette General officials.
   Capt. Anthony D. Phillips, 28, a radar navigator; Airman 1st
Class Joseph A. Vallie, 20, a gunner; and 1st Lt. Daniel McCarrick,
25, an electronic warfare officer, were listed as stable, the
hospital said.
   Each crewman transported to Wright-Patterson was listed in
serious condition, said Don Swan, a civilian spokesman. They were:
Capt. Mark Hartney, 29, an aircraft commander; 1st Lt. Michael S.
Debruzzi, 26, a pilot; and 1st Lt. James W. Herrmann, 30, a
navigator.
   Peck said weather apparently was not a factor in the crash. The
National Weather Service said a nearby municipal airport reported
conditions as clear with a temperature of 39 degrees.
   The eight-engine B-52, first deployed in the early 1950s, is the
military's biggest bomber with a wingspan of 185 feet. The last B-52
was commissioned in 1962. The original cost of the aircraft was
$9,955,000, said Capt. Harry Edwards, at SAC headquarters.
   Six crewmen died and 10 were injured Oct. 11 when an Air Force
tanker en route from K.I. Sawyer crashed at Wurtsmith Air Force Base
near Oscoda in Michigan's northeastern Lower Peninsula. The Air
Force's investigation of that crash is incomplete.
   Five of the original 102 B-52s have crashed and one was destroyed
in a ground fire, said Technical Sgt. Alan Dockery, from SAC
headquarters. The most recent crash occurred Oct. 16, 1984, in
Arizona, when a crew practicing low-level flights crashed into a
plateau, he said.

<TEXT>
   Animal rights activists are incensed with Prince
Philip, president of the World Wide Fund for Nature, for calling the
costly rescue of two whales off Alaska a ``circus act'' irrelevant
to conserving the species.
   During the same appearance Tuesday, the outspoken 67-year-old
husband of Queen Elizabeth II also created a stir with a chance
remark comparing wives with prostitutes.
   Answering questions at a luncheon given by the Association of
American Correspondents in London, Prince Philip said the successful
$1.3 million operation in October to rescue two California gray
whales from winter ice off northern Alaska was in many ways
counterproductive.
   The prince said the rescue gave people a false impression that
``they are doing something about conserving nature.''
   He said resources devoted to rescuing the whales could have been
used for ``very much more positive things,'' adding that gray whales
as a species are vulnerable to Eskimo hunters.
   The three-week operation to free the whales involved U.S.
scientists, Eskimos and two Soviet icebreakers and attracted world
news media attention.
   ``You have got to see it as a circus act or an act of
entertainment. In that sense it was highly successful,'' he said.
   The whales became trapped after failing to leave the region early
enough on their annual migration to waters off Mexico. Gray whales
regularly become trapped and die this way.
   Asked why the plight of the two whales attracted international
attention and aid, he said: ``I honestly don't know (except) it's
quite a dramatic idea. ... It had no signifigance whatever for the
conservation of nature or for the conservation of that species.''
   Prince Philip, who has been president of the fund, formerly the
World Wildlife Fund, since 1981 and who travels widely promoting
nature conservation, also defended his own interest in hunting.
   He compared taking part in bloodsports, a favorite pastime of the
royals, to being a butcher who sells the meat of slaughtered animals.
   ``I don't think doing it (killing animals) for money makes it any
more moral. I don't think a prostitute is more moral than a wife,
but they are doing the same thing,'' he said.
   ``It is really rather like saying it is perfectly all right to
commit adultery _ providing you don't enjoy it,'' he added.
   James Barrington, executive director of the League Against Cruel
Sports, a British animal rights group, said: ``Prince Philip seems
to be so out of touch with ordinary, decent people. I am saddened
and offended by his attitude.''
   He said the prince failed to recognize that wild animals killed
for sport suffered far more than farm animals slaughtered for meat.
``If the Duke of Edinburgh wants to help the cause of conservation
the best thing he can do is keep his mouth shut,'' Barrington said.
   Charles Secrett, campaigns director for the environmental group
Friends of the Earth, called ridiculous Prince Philip's comments on
both the whale rescue and bloodsports.
   Referring to the prince's remark on wives and prostitutes,
legislator Clare Short of the opposition Labor Party said: ``He has
just insulted his wife and all the married women of Britain. He has
called his wife the equivalent of a prostitute.''
   Another Labor legislator, Ron Brown, said: ``It is typical of the
duke that every time he opens his mouth he lets his belly rumble. It
is another case of the duke's double-think.
   ``You go with a prostitute to enjoy it. That is why you pay for
it. But the killing of animals is something different, bearing in
mind that animals have no... means of protecting themselves against
humans. At least a prostitute can say `No' or refuse the money.''
   The Times of London and the tabloid Daily Mirror reported Prince
Philip's remarks on whales, wives and prostitutes on their front
pages without comment. The Daily Mirror headlined its report:
``Wives v. Whores by Philip.''
   The prince, a Royal Navy officer in World War II, often expresses
himself in bluff, salty turns of phrase and is not famous for his
tact.

<TEXT>
   The former live-in lover of a lawyer accused of
beating his llegally adopted 6-year-old daughter to death described
a life of drug use and hypnotism, and testified the girl was
sexually abused at age 2.
   In her third day of cross-examination by the defense in state
court Tuesday, Hedda Nussbaum admitted using heroin, cocaine and
LSD, and said defendant Joel Steinberg told her she had the power to
put people in a trance.
   Steinberg's attorney, Ira London, attempted to discredit Ms.
Nussbaum's testimony for the prosecution with repeated questions
about drug use, hypnotism and an imaginary cult.
   Steinberg, a 47-year-old disbarred lawyer, is charged with murder
in the November 1987 beating death of Lisa Steinberg, whom he
illegally obtained at birth from an unmarried teen-ager.
   Lisa's death in an affluent, well-educated household shocked many
and led to a re-examination of the duty and ability of neighbors,
teachers and social workers to recognize and report evidence of
child abuse.
   Ms. Nussbaum, the prosecution's star witness, has directly
implicated Steinberg in the death, saying he admitted knocking Lisa
down the night the girl was fatally injured.
   Ms. Nussbaum said Tuesday that Steinberg made her believe that
hypnotism and programming by the imaginary cult had made her have
``sex with everybody in the world.''
   ``I was hypnotizing everyone ... and was using them sexually,''
she said.
   At that point Ms. Nussbaum smiled. ``The absurdity of the whole
thing just hit me,'' she said as she dabbed her left eye with a
tissue. The tear duct, allegedly ruptured by a Steinberg beating,
drains continuously.
   Ms. Nussbaum said the sexual abuse occurred in 1983, when Lisa
spent three weeks at the home of a doctor who often joined her and
Steinberg in cocaine parties.
   She said the doctor later told her and Steinberg during an
``encounter session'' that his wife had sexually abused the girl.
   Ms. Nussbaum said she showed Steinberg a bruise on Lisa's vagina
but ``he didn't take any action or do anything about it.''
   She admitted that she did not take Lisa to a doctor or hospital.
   ``No, no,'' Ms. Nussbaum said. ``I took her to Joel.''
   She said she took no action against the couple and did nothing to
ensure that Lisa had not been harmed physically or emotionally.
   Ms. Nussbaum glanced several times at the defense table, where
Steinberg sat, either gazing at her intently or scribbling notes.
   Asked by London about books on demonology, necromancy and other
occult subjects that police found at the apartment she shared with
Steinberg, she said they were research materials for a book of
horror stories she was writing for teen-agers.
   Ms. Nussbaum, a children's book editor, denied that she was
interested in satanic cults and witchcraft.
   She said she and Steinberg took precautions against posthypnotic
buzzwords they believed could trigger certain actions when heard by
a subject.
   Ms. Nussbaum said Steinberg also warned her that her own sister,
Judy Liebman, ``was a member of this cult and could buzz me.''
   Ms. Liebman, watching the trial from a front row seat, said,
``It's crazy but it was one of his (Steinberg's) ways of controlling
her.''
   London also tried to show that Steinberg was irrational. He
frequently asked Ms. Nussbaum whether Steinberg actually believed
the incredible things he told her. She said she did not know.
   On Monday, London asked for permission to present a belated
insanity defense. State judge Harold Rothwax denied the request.

   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev should remember Pearl Harbor as they meet in New York,
says a retired Navy captain who survived the Japanese sneak attack
47 years ago today.
   ``I hope they're working for peace as we're remembering war,''
said Forrest Biard, who was to be the keynote speaker at a National
Park Service ceremony marking the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that plunged
the United States into World War II.
   ``We were both on the same side during World War II, but look
what's happened since then,'' the 75-year-old Biard said of the
superpowers. Gorbachev arrived in New York on Tuesday for informal
talks with Reagan and President-elect George Bush.
   Thousands were expected to attend ceremonies across Hawaii today
commemorating the air raid on Hawaiian military installations. The
largest crowds generally gather at Pearl Harbor, which was hardest
hit.
   The Park Service predicted 1,000 people _ sailors past and
present, tourists and history buffs _ would mark the attack at its
ceremony on the harbor shore, and that 5,000 others would attend
special programs and lectures throughout the day.
   More than 2,400 people were killed and 1,200 wounded that Sunday
morning in 1941.
   The Navy planned a private ceremony today aboard the USS Arizona
Memorial, which spans the sunken hull of the battleship as a tribute
to the 1,177 men who went down with the battleship. The Arizona was
one of 21 ships damaged or destroyed in the raid.
   At 7:55 a.m. HST (12:55 p.m. EDT), the moment the first bombs
fell, a moment of silence was to be observed. Then, Hawaii Air
National Guard jets were to fly in the ``missing man'' formation.
   A Navy ship was to pass the memorial, and wreaths and flowers
were to be presented as the national anthem and Navy hymn were
played.
   Remarks by Navy officials were to be followed by prayers, a
21-gun salute and Marine Corps buglers playing ``Taps.''
   Pearl Harbor entered this year's presidential campaign on Sept. 7
when Bush, in a speech to an American Legion meeting in Louisville,
Ky., erroneously reminded veterans that that day was the attack's
anniversary.
   The flub angered many Pearl Harbor survivors, but had a positive
effect, said Dan Martinez, a spokesman at the USS Arizona Memorial.
   ``Unfortunately, so many Americans, especially younger ones, have
forgotten the importance of Pearl Harbor, or never learned it,''
Martinez said. ``So in a way, Mr. Bush's mistake got people to
remember when it really was, and what it really means.
   ``December 7, 1941, is a turning point in history,'' he said,
adding that ``it changed the lives of all Americans, whether they
realize it or not.''

   The space shuttle Atlantis
played to an all-but-empty house when it returned from its hush-hush
Defense Department mission, and even its sonic booms seemed quieter
than usual.
   The crowds that have numbered in the hundreds of thousands to
greet previous returning shuttles were forbidden from the base for
Tuesday afternoon's landing on Rogers Dry Lake.
   Only the news media, base workers and 125 invited guests were on
hand, a far cry from the 425,000 that that greeted the shuttle
Discovery when it landed in October.
   The small crowd, some on the roof of NASA's Ames-Dryden Flight
Research Facility building, cheered and clapped, and a minute after
the 3:35 p.m. touchdown the ``Star-Spangled Banner'' blared from
loudspeakers.
   Two booms crackled overhead as Atlantis descended through partly
sunny skies and made its swooping approach.
   ``The sonic boom was not as loud as usual,'' Barbara Selby, a
NASA spoekswoman, told The New York Times.
   For the Oct. 3 landing of Discovery, Vice President George Bush,
who was then in the homestretch of his presidential campaign, rode
out across the dusty clay to greet Discovery's crew. He later
proclaimed them America's new heroes at a red-white-and-blue
ceremony attended by a marching band and famed test pilot Chuck
Yeager.
   Atlantis's five crew members had to make do with greetings from
NASA administrators when they climbed down the stairway from the
orbiter. Instead of a ceremony there was a photo opportunity: A van
pulled up in front of reporters and NASA workers who had waited into
the night and the crew got to say a few words.
   Instead of the vice president they were introduced by the acting
director of the Ames Research Center.
   But that didn't seem to deflate the elation of Atlantis' crew.
   ``It's always great to come visit here and it's especially great
to come visit under these kind of circumstances,'' said Navy Cmdr.
Robert L. Gibson, the mission commander.
   ``Hey, thanks for coming out,'' said Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S.
Gardner as he stepped to the microphone. ``I was stationed here
about 10 years ago and it's great to get another lake bed landing
in. ... We had just a great time and did some good things for our
country.''
   Col. Richard M. Mullane saluted the NASA workers: ``We certainly
do greatly and deeply appreciate the opportunity to ride a rocket
that's supported by such fine people.''
   ``Space flight is something that you can't describe to other
people as hard as we try,'' said Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross, ``but I
think from the smile that all of us have on our faces you can get a
sense that it was quite an experience.''
   Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd agreed.
   ``It's something that leaves you really speechless about trying
to describe it to somebody else,'' he said.
   Though the low-key atmosphere seemed strange it was not
unprecedented.
   The first Department of Defense shuttle mission, designated 51-J
and flown Oct. 3-7, 1985, ended much the same way.
   ``That was probably quieter,'' said Ralph Jackson, a NASA
spokesman at Edwards.

   A Soviet newspaper, reflecting on the final meeting
of Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Reagan, expressed a sense of
loss today over the departure of the leader who once called the
Soviet Union an ``evil empire.''
   Gorbachev's arrival in New York on Tuesday received front-page
attention in the official press and was broadcast on the morning
television program ``120 Minutes.''
   But because of the eight-hour time difference between Moscow and
New York, Soviets this morning got little more than their
president's arrival statement. Nationwide newspapers printed on
their front pages a picture from Moscow of Gorbachev's departure.
   Gorbachev's speech to the United Nations today was to be shown
live in Moscow, officials of state television said.
   The Soviet leader's gathering shortly afterward with Reagan and
President-elect Bush will be the last of five official meetings
between Gorbachev and the U.S. president.
   Because of his defense build-up and statements labeling the
Soviet Union an ``evil empire,'' the Soviet press portrayed Reagan
in the early years of his presidency as an unstable, missile-toting
cowboy.
   But Yuri Bandura, a columnist for the weekly Moscow News,
expressed ``a feeling somehow close to a feeling of loss'' over the
final Reagan-Gorbachev meeting.
   ``The feeling is more natural if you bring to mind the alarm
caused by Reagan's words and deeds over about half of his
presidency, how dramatically his cooperation with Mikhail Gorbachev
began, and how many long-lost hopes ... were returned to us by the
persistance of these two people in the search for common goals and
movement toward them,'' he wrote.
   Bandura said Reagan, ``least of all for us resembles a kind Uncle
Sam.''
   The Soviet Union has said Gorbachev is hoping during his meeting
with Bush and Reagan to set the groundwork for progress on arms
control issues with the Bush admininstration once it takes office in
January.

<TEXT>
   Lack of safe drinking water has
triggered an outbreak of water-borne disease in the coastal areas
battered by a cyclone that killed at least 2,200 people, a newspaper
reported today.
   ``The agonies of the cyclone victims have proliferated due to
outbreak of diarrheal diseases,'' said The New Nation, an
independent English-language daily.
   The newspaper did not say how many cases had been reported.
Health Ministry officials could not immediately be reached for
comment.
   The government has said at least 933 people died when the cyclone
roared up the Bay of Bengal on Nov. 29, spawning tidal waves and
lashing 30 of Bangladesh's 64 districts.
   The storm killed another 500 people in neighboring India's West
Bengal state, which abuts Bangladesh, according to officials in
Calcutta.
   The actual number of deaths may never be known because of poor
communications and slow reporting by bureaucrats. The New Nation and
other Dhaka newspapers said at least 2,226 people were killed.
   The Bangladesh Observer said today that another 6,000 people,
most of them fishermen and woodcutters, were still missing. The
newspapers based their figures on reports from officials in the
districts hit by the storm.
   ``Our boats, along with some from local government organizations,
are combing the bay for the missing. But we may abandon the search,
for those in the sea for nine days could not have survived,'' said
an officer at the Titumir naval base in Khulna, 80 miles southwest
of Dhaka.
   The Red Crescent Society, the Islamic equivalent of the Red
Cross, said Sunday at least 1,150 people had died. The organization
has not updated its figures since then.

   A nurse's aide suffocated elderly patients
at a nursing home for the ``emotional release'' it brought her, her
alleged accomplice told police, according to court documents.
   Catherine Wood, former nurse's aide supervisor at Alpine Manor
Nursing Home, also told investigators that Gwendolyn Graham killed
six patients in their beds and collected a ``souvenir'' from each,
according to search warrants released this week.
   The women are suspects in the deaths of eight female patients at
the nursing home in this Grand Rapids suburb from January 1987 to
May 1987.
   Wood, 26, was charged Monday with two counts of murder and held
without bond pending a Dec. 16 preliminary hearing.
   Graham, 25, was arrested Sunday near her home in Tyler, Texas,
and arraigned on one count of murder. She was being held on $1
million bond, and was fighting extradition to Michigan.
   Police Chief Walt Sprenger said Tuesday that the six other deaths
were being investigated and that more charges against the women were
likely.
   Under questioning by police Oct. 7, Wood said Graham had told her
``that each of the (six) killings provided an emotional release for
her,'' with the exception of the death of 97-year-old Edith Cook,
who was killed to end her suffering from gangrene, according to the
documents.
   Wood also told police that she and Graham lived together from
September 1986 to July 1987 and were lovers, the documents said.
   Wood told police she witnessed the Jan. 18, 1987, killing of
60-year-old Marguerite Chambers, an Alzheimer's patient.
   She ``observed Gwendolyn Gail Graham suffocating (the patient) by
pressing a washcloth beneath the chin of Chambers and another
washcloth over Chambers' mouth and nose,'' the warrant said. She
told police she did not intervene.
   Wood told police Graham would tell her of the killings either
just before or after they occurred.
   At the time of their deaths, the eight patients were believed to
have died from natural causes and no autopsies were performed.
   Wood, who worked at the home from July 1985 to October 1988, is
charged with killing Cook and Chambers. Graham, who worked at the
home from June 1986 to July 1987, is charged with killing Cook. Both
bodies were exhumed last week, but autopsies have proved
inconclusive.
   Both aides had received good marks from patients and neither was
fired, nursing home officials said.
   Sprenger said he has ruled out mercy killings and financial
profit as motives. He said the women's lesbian relationship was
``part of a complex web that brings the whole thing together,'' but
would not elaborate.
   Wood's ex-husband, Ken Wood sparked the investigation when he
approached police about the deaths last October.

   For 170 Soviet men and women and 169
Americans, the first U.S.-U.S.S.R. Emerging Leaders Summit ending
today was a week of intense discussions they'll long remember as
they head for home or sightseeing.
   A few delegates, including conference leaders, plan to head for
New York Thursday to meet Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   They plan to give Gorbachev their ``Final Appeal,'' a report on
the meeting scheduled to be released at this morning's closing
plenary session.
   On Friday, the Soviet delegation and many Americans will attend a
reception at the Soviet Embassy in Washington.
   The summit was sponsored by the Columbus, Ind.-based American
Center for International and the Soviet Committee of Youth
Organizations. A followup summit is planned next year in Moscow.
   At the summit's start Thursday, U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
urged delegates to speak out on the issues that divide the two world
powers.
   The Soviets and Americans talked frankly, taking their cue from
the Gorbachev policy of ``glasnost'' or openness, on 16 topics
including international business and trade, the mass media, youth
work and social services, religion, education, urban development,
global environment, international finance, and science and
technology.
   Soviets also ventured out into the streets, to schools, to law
offices, to television stations, to a road construction site, even
to a so-called citadel of capitalism _ the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange _ to see what Americans were doing, and how they lived and
worked.
   Inna Novikova, a Soviet interpreter, spent some of her time
interviewing homeless people she had seen while being bused through
downtown Philadelphia on the way to dances, concerts, the Army-Navy
football game and America's historic Liberty Bell.
   ``Not everything is perfect in this country,'' she said after
visiting some of the poor. ``There's not as much wealth (in the
Soviet Union) but we don't have the tremendous poverty either.''
   It was different for some delegates at the nation's oldest stock
exchange, where they swapped Russian rubles for American dollars,
strictly for souvenirs.
   Rein Kaareprere, assistant to the prime minister of Estonia, one
of the 15 republics that make up the Soviet Union, said he expected
his country may soon set up a stock exchange.
   The Soviets also hope their ruble soon will be accepted as
currency in international trade. Currently, they must buy foreign
goods with hard currency that can be spent in the West.
   ``It is a barrier to trade and has to be destroyed,'' said
Vladimir Ogorodnikov, deputy director of a Soviet watch factory, as
he watched stock traders shout.

<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors took more than 30 days to
present their case against Bess Myerson, but defense lawyers at the
former Miss America's divorce-fixing trial took just one day to make
their point.
   Neither Miss Myerson, the city's former cultural affairs
commissioner and Miss America 1945, nor either of her two
co-defendants testified Tuesday as the defense presented its side.
   The trial will resume Monday when lawyers begin a week of final
arguments to the jury, which could get the case the following week.
   Miss Myerson, 64; her lover, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso, 43, and
former state Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel, 75, are charged
with an alleged conspiracy to fix Capasso's divorce.
   Miss Myerson is accused of giving a $19,000 city job to the
judge's daughter in 1983 in exchange for a sharp reduction of
Capasso's temporary support payments to his estranged wife.
   Prosecutors have contended that Miss Myerson, named correspondent
in the divorce by Capasso's wife, Nancy, sought to have the payments
slashed out of greed.
   In his opening statement to the jury 10 weeks ago, Assistant U.S.
Attorney David Lawrence said that Miss Myerson's ``affair of the
heart'' with Capasso ``became an affair of the pocketbook. The gifts
and luxuries that Mr. Capasso previously (had) given to his wife and
his children were now being lavished on Miss Myerson.''
   But Myerson attorney Frederick Hafetz read numerous financial
documents to the jury to show that Miss Myerson had a net worth of
at least $7 million during the period of the alleged conspiracy.
   According to the documents, Miss Myerson, once a television
celebrity and Democratic Senate nomination hopeful, had large sums
invested in Manhattan real estate partnerships and brkerage accounts.
   Capasso lawyer Jay Goldberg introduced documents that showed his
client incurred legal fees of $480,000, backing up his claim that
Capasso wouldn't have spent so much money on lawyers if his divorce
was ``fixed.''
   Former Mayor Robert F. Wagner was among several character witness
who testified on behalf of Mrs. Gabel.
   Asked about the former judge's reputation by defense lawyer
Michael Feldberg, Wagner said it was ``the finest reputation that
anyone could have.''
   Former City Council President Paul O'Dwyer said Mrs. Gabel's
reputation was ``excellent'' and author Robert Caro said she was
kind to him and consented to an interview when New York master
builder Robert Moses, the subject of his Pulitzer prize-winning
biography ``The Power Broker,'' told everyone else in city
government not to cooperate.
   The trial began Oct. 4.
   The prosecution case consisted of 150 exhibits and 34 witnesses,
including Mayor Edward I. Koch and Mrs. Gabel's daughter, Sukhreet.
   All three defendants are charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and
other bribe-related charges. If convicted on all counts, they face a
maximum penalty of 25 years in prison and $263,0000 in fines.
   Miss Myerson faces up to five more years if convicted of
obstruction of justice.

   Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who assumed the
presidency last August after Mohammad Zia ul Haq was killed in a
plane crash, is one of eight candidates to file nomination papers
for the post.
   The presidential election in this nation of 105 million will take
place Monday. The president is elected by Pakistan's Senate,
National Assembly and four legislative assemblies.
   Ishaq Khan, 73, is seeking a full five-year term as president.
His candidacy has the support of both Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto's populist Pakistan People's Party and the rival right-wing
Islamic Democratic Alliance.
   Ms. Bhutto was named prime minister after her party won a
plurality of seats in last month's parliamentary elections.
   Ishaq Khan has served in senior administrative posts for nearly
40 years, including six as minister for finance and commerce. He was
elected chairman of the Senate in 1985, and as the upper chamber's
chairman he assumed the presidency upon Zia's death on Aug. 17.
   Nawbzada Nasrullah Khan, 72, is the second major candidate but
has never been in government. He does, however, have a reputation as
an opposition leader that dates to the 1940s, when the Indian
subcontinent was fighting for independence from Britain.
   Nasrullah Khan was jailed by the British several times. He was
also in jail for several years after Pakistan became a republic in
1956 because of strong views against various governments. He heads
the small right-of-center Pakistan Democratic Party, of which he is
the only member in the National Assembly.
   A third candidate, retired Gen. Tikka Khan, 73, is an old-time
Pakistan People's Party member.
   Ms. Bhutto said in a statement Tuesday that, ``Gen. Tikka Khan's
nomination papers for the office of the president have been filed
only as a cover candidate for President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.''
   By that it means Tikka Khan's name will be withdrawn when Ishaq
Khan's nomination papers receive final approval from the election
commission on Saturday.
   Tikka Khan served as Pakistan's army chief of staff during the
1970s rule of Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was
overthrown in a 1977 coup and executed nearly two years later.
   Tikka Khan was also commanding general in East Pakistan province,
which broke away in 1971 to established itself as independent
Bangladesh.
   He is known for ordering a brutal military operation against
millions of East Pakistanis in 1970 that fueled separatist
agitation. This agitation was said to have resulted in a
full-fledged war between the Pakistan army and separatists backed by
the Indian Army.
   Ahmed Jaffar, a prominent businessman, also filed his nomination
papers. The other four, relatively unknown, are Mohammed Rafiq
Mohammed, Mohammed Nauroz Malik, Sheikh Mohammed Salim Sethi and Lal
Khan Watti.

   The operations of the country's first labor
group placed under government control were returned to allies of the
former mob-dominated leadership of Teamsters Local 560 following a
final tally of votes today.
   The Teamsters for Liberty ticket, a strong, well organized group
whose candidates are related to two barred union leaders, won 65
percent of the vote after the 4,530 ballots were counted, according
to state Board of Mediation officials.
   Teamsters for Liberty outpolled the rival United New Beginning
party by 2,842 votes to 1,535, officials said.
   Despite the kinship of leaders between the new group and the old,
a government trustee of the union said he saw progress in Tuesday's
vote.
   ``The question, and ultimately the success of the trusteeship, is
whether the process continues or whether the freedom these people
have created is destroyed,'' said Edwin H. Stier, a former federal
and state prosecutor who was appointed trustee of the 7,600-member
union when the government took over.
   But Stier said that after talking with all the parties, he was
confident ``everybody is going to try to run this union in a
progressive way.''
   The local is one of the largest in the nation and was taken over
by the government 2{ years ago to purge it of organized crime.
   The winning slate of candidates included Danny Sciarra and Mark
Sheridan, the brother and nephew, respectively, of former local
leaders Michael Sciarra and Joseph Sheridan.
   Michael Sciarra and Joseph Sheridan served as interim officers
during appeals of the government takeover. When a federal judge
barred them this fall from running in the election because of their
links to the old regime, they nominated their kin to become officers.
   The government said Michael Sciarra was the designated heir of
the Genovese organized crime family. He has denied any involvement
in organized crime.
   The losing slate was backed by an independent, rank-and-file
movement and represented opponents of the union's former officers
from the 1960s.
   ``We put up a fight,'' said Ray Carney, who opposed Sciarra for
president. ``You got a lot to overcome. We don't have the money they
have.''
   Carney, who lost the last contested election 23 years ago, was a
friend of a murdered Local 560 dissident, Anthony Castellito, who
was garroted with piano wire at the direction of ousted union
official Anthony ``Tony Pro'' Provenzano.
   U.S. District Judge Harold A. Ackerman, in ruling in favor in
1984 of the Justice Department's racketeering lawsuit seeking to
remove the local's executive board, wrote, ``This group of
gangsters, aided and abetted by their relatives and sycophants,
engaged in a multifaceted orgy of criminal activity.''
   The union was dominated by the Provenzano group, an alleged
faction of the Genovese organized crime group. The three Provenzano
brothers _ Anthony, Salvatore and Nunzio _ all have been jailed for
a variety of crimes, including racketeering and extortion.

<HEAD>High Brings Cold, Snow into Rockies and Northern Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A high-pressure system whipped cold Canadian air and snow into
the Rockies and northern Plains early today, and light rain was
scattered along the Pacific Coast and through much of the South.
   Light snow fell from eastern sections of Washington and Oregon
through Montana and Wyoming and into western Colorado and northern
Utah, as well as in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota.
   There were no significant accumulations by early morning, but up
to 6 inches were expected at higher elevations near Denver, where a
snow advisory was in effect.
   Patches of light rain continued along the Pacific Coast, and rain
stretched over a large area from north-central Texas to Oklahoma,
northwest Arkansas, central and southern Missouri and western
Kentucky. Thunderstorms developed over southwest Oklahoma and
northwest Texas.
   Dense fog reduced visibility to less than 100 feet in parts of
the San Joaquin Valley in California. Skies were partly cloudy over
the Southwest and the Gulf Coast states and mostly clear in the
Northeast.
   Today's forecast called for snow from Utah to the Rockies and the
central and northern Plains, and in northern Michigan; and scattered
rain in parts of Texas, northern Louisiana, eastern Oklahoma,
Arkansas and southern Missouri.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 20s from the northern and
central Rockies to the Dakotas, Minnesota and northern Michigan; the
30s and 40s from northern New England to the Great Lakes, the middle
Mississippi Valley, the central Plains, southern Rockies, Nevada and
the Pacific Northwest; and in the 70s in Southern California, the
desert Southwest, southern Texas, the Gulf Coast and the south
Atlantic Coast. A few 80-degree readings were expected in extreme
southern Florida and Texas. Elsewhere, highs were expected to be in
the 50s and 60s.
   At 2 a.m. EST, temperatures ranged from 16 degrees at Concord,
N.H., to 73 degrees at Santa Barbara, Calif., and Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.

   The dollar rose against all major currencies in
nervous European trading early today, buoyed by hopes
President-elect George Bush will act decisively to trim the nation's
budget deficit. Gold prices fell.
   Dealers said the market was boosted by a rally that sent the
dollar up sharply in New York trading Tuesday. They said the upward
move was triggered by new hopes Bush is intent on cutting the
massive budget deficit.
   Traders said rumors of a Soviet arms reducation initiative also
propelled the dollar higher. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
arrived Tuesday in New York for his final official meeting with
President Reagan.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.89 Japanese yen to a closing 122.43 yen. Later, in
London, it rose further to 122.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.7452 West German marks, up from 1.7290
   _1.4663 Swiss francs, up from 1.4480
   _5.9580 French francs, up from 5.9015
   _1.9675 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9470
   _1,289.50 Italian lire, up from 1,277.12
   _1.1925 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1887
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8535 from $1.8675 late
Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $425 a troy ounce, down
from $427.25 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $425.35.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $425.30, down from $427.75 bid
late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.07 to close at a bid $426.66.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $6.13 a troy
ounce, up from $6.12 bid late Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   ITT Corp. has been fined $200,000 for treating Air
Force officials to golf games, meals and theater tickets to obtain
confidential government information used to bid on $180 million in
military contracts.
   U.S. District Judge David S. Nelson imposed the fine Tuesday on
the New York-based conglomerate, which pleaded guilty in October to
conspiring to defraud the government. ITT had faced a maximum fine
of $500,000.
   ITT admitted an employee in 1984 and 1985 spent about $15,000 and
was reimbursed for illegal gifts to Air Force officials at Hanscom
Air Force Base in Bedford.
   In exchange, ITT received documents with confidential procurement
information on two Air Force programs ITT was interested in
purchasing.
   ``We agreed to plead guilty to one charge of fraud. The
government agreed to drop three other charges,'' said ITT spokesman
James Gallagher.
   ITT was indicted in 1987, several months before a separate
federal investigation began into the use of consultants by
corporations to get information for use in bidding on contracts.
   Edward M. Vincenzi, a senior marketing representative of ITT's
Van Nuys, Calif.-based Gilfillan subsidiary, which specializes in
radar technology, also pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud and
was placed on probation for a year.
   Vincenzi, who cooperated with federal authorities, had faced up
to 35 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
   Prosecutors charged that ITT Gilfillan executives tacitly
approved of attempts by Vincenzi to defraud the government and tried
to cover up his activities by destroying or concealing Air Force
documents.
   According to the indictment, Vincenzi was hired in 1983 to pursue
two Air Force contracts _ an anti-radiation missile decoy system
valued at more than $80 million and a mobile air traffic control
radar system worth between $100 million and $150 million.
   Four employees at the Air Force's Electronics Systems Division at
Hanscom who received gratuities from Vincenzi gave him copies of
documents with information on the contracts, as well as general
planning and funding documents.
   ITT won a preliminary $6.4 million development contract for the
missile decoy system, which was never built.
   Vincenzi met with one Hanscom official several times and bought
him lunches, paid for him to play golf and gave him theater and
sports tickets and liquor, the indictment said.

   Five inmates were wounded by gunfire
and eight others were injured during fighting among 400 prisoners in
a maximum-security unit of the Guayama Regional Prison south of San
Juan, police said.
   Hundreds of inmates rioted Tuesday when a gang war broke out at a
penitentiary 51 miles south of San Juan, and police said prisoners
took the warden hostage before surrendering.
   The seven-hour prison takeover ended when the prisoners
surrendered weapons and released their hostage.
   ``They didn't hurt me but at one point I was scared for my
life,'' said the warden, Roberto Sanchez Camareno.
   Department of Corrections administrator Mercedes Otero, who
headed negotiations with the prisoners, said in exchange for the
warden's release prison officials agreed to transfer 130 inmates to
other institutions beginning today.
   Osvaldo Medina Lugo, a leader of the rebellion, said in a
telephone interview, ``We also received assurances that there would
be no reprisals or punishment'' for the prison takeover.
   Inmates surrendered homemade weapons, including knifes, and
returned to their cells, officials said.
   Medina Lugo said the wounded prisoners were shot at by prison
guards during the melee and that inmates had no guns inside the
prison.
   The injured, suffering from gunshot wounds, burns and broken
bones, were treated at local hospitals.
   Rodriguez Fonseca said the rebellion flared at around 3:50 p.m.
(4:50 p.m. EST) when one gang tried to break into the new
maximum-security section of the prison where another gang was being
held.
   He said many inmates went on a rampage during the fighting and
set fire to part of the prison. A wing of the prison appeared gutted.

<HEAD>Anti-Terrorism Act Made Permanent In Britain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Special powers police have used for 14 years to
fight terrorism in Northern Ireland have been made permanent by the
House of Commons.
   The Commons voted 305-45 on Tuesday in favor of the proposed law,
under which Parliament no longer would have to renew the 1974
Prevention of Terrorism Act every year. The act gives police
sweeping powers to detain terrorist suspects without trial for up to
a week and restrict their movements.
   Dissident members of the opposition Labor Party cast all 45 votes
against the measure. Labor Party leaders had ordered their 226
legislators to abstain, rather than vote against the bill.
   The measure was intended mainly to counteract the Irish
Republican Army's guerrilla campaign against British forces in
Northern Ireland.
   It was expected to be approved by the 650-member Commons, where
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party has a 101-seat
majority.
   Later the bill is to be examined by a bipartisan committee. It
was expected to pass all legislative stages without difficulty and
become law next year.
   Before the vote, Mrs. Thatcher told Parliament: ``I can think of
nothing more important to indicate that people are determined in
fighting terrorism.'' ``Not to have the powers of this bill would
enlarge the opportunities for terrorism,'' said Ian Stewart,
minister for Northern Ireland.
   However, opposition legislator Barry Sheerman said every
repressive measure passed by the government was celebrated by
terrorists as a symptom of their success. ``The bill represents
further encroachment on the rights and liberties of all people of
our country and a step further down the tragic path to a less
democratic and less free society,'' Sheerman said.
   The act allows suspected terrorists to be detained without charge
for 48 hours, although the government can extend that for five days,
and to bar suspects in Northern Ireland from entering mainland
Britain.
   On Monday night, the Commons approved a bill that would make all
candidates for local and provincial assembly offices in Northern
Ireland sign a declaration disavowing violence.
   The measure, which passed by a 274-41 vote, was seen as aimed
mainly at Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political arm.
   It will permit the prosecution and possible ouster of council
members who publicly support the IRA's violent campaign to drive the
British government out of Northern Ireland.
   More than 2,700 people have been killed in almost 20 years of
political and sectarian violence in the province.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA aims to unite Protestant-dominated
Northern Ireland with the Catholic Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule.
   Sinn Fein commands about one-third of the Catholic vote in
Northern Ireland and captured about one-tenth of the seats in 17 of
the province's 26 local councils in May 1985.

<TEXT>
   A black Roman Catholic priest
who says he was tortured by police has announced the matter was
settled out of court for $11,000.
   The Rev. Smangaliso Mkhatshwa said Tuesday that authorities
decided to resolve the ``brutal, shameless and degrading assault''
without a trial to avoid bad publicity.
   Mkhatshwa was secretary-general of the South African Catholic
Bishops' Conference when the alleged assault took place Aug. 21,
1986, after police detained him without charge in Pretoria.
   Mkhatshwa, now secretary-general of the Institute for Contextual
Theology, said police took him to an unknown destination and forced
him to stand blindfolded and handcuffed for about 30 hours while
authorities used an unspecified instrument to hurt his genitals.
   His interrogators repeatedly insulted him and fired shots near
his ears, Mkhatshwa said.
   His allegations were made in a civil damage claim. The attorney
general told Mkhatshwa's lawyers that six men were charged with
criminal injury in the case. One police captain paid a $90 admission
of guilt fine and the other men were absolved of any wrongdoing
without a trial.
   Police did not comment on the case Tuesday.
   The government has paid thousands of dollars in out-of-court
settlements this year to resolve cases of alleged police torture.
Under the arrangement, the government does not admit liability.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying lengths during the 29 month-old state of emergency. About
1,000 people still are in detention.

   The Dutch coast guard today tried
to locate nine containers with dangerous chemicals that have been
adrift in the North Sea since the weekend, a Transport Ministry
spokesman said.
   One is filled with copper oxyde, which is lethal to marine
micro-organisms, according to spokesman Benno Bruggink.
   The containers, which also contain highly flammable chemicals,
were lost Sunday night in a raging storm by the French roll-on
roll-off ferry Aquila. Bruggink said there is no immediate danger of
explosions because the containers are believed to be in good
condition.
   The Aquila, which is owned by the Union Industrielle et Maritime
of Marseille, France, was on its way from West Germany to an
unidentified British port when it lost the containers 37 miles off
the northern Dutch coast, Bruggink said.
   A warning has been issued to all ships in the area, Bruggink said.

   Parliament today elected Economics
Minister Jean-Pascal Delamuraz to the ceremonial post of Swiss
president for 1989.
   Delamuraz will succeed Finance Minister Otto Stich in the
presidency, which rotates annually among the seven members of the
Federal Council, Switzerland's top executive body.
   Justice Minister Elisabeth Kopp, the first woman elected to the
Federal Council, was made vice president, putting her in line for
the presidency in 1990.
   Delamuraz, like Mrs. Kopp a member of the conservative Radical
Democratic party, was elected with a comfortable majority of 201 in
the 246-member Federal Assembly.
   Mrs. Kopp's majority was smaller, 165. Legislators of the Green
and Socialist parties abstained on the vote on Mrs. Kopp, saying
allegations about her husband's business dealings had not been
cleared up.
   Her husband, Hans Kopp, resigned in October from the board of
Shakarchi Trading A.G., a Lebanese-controlled, Zurich-based company
that a Swiss prosecutor says was part of a $1 billion drug money
laundering operation. The company has denied the allegation.
   Kopp has said he was not familiar with the day-to-day business of
the company and rejected suggestions of any wrongdoing. Kopp, a
lawyer, has said he resigned because he had too much other work.

<HEAD>Brain-Damaged Boy Receives $25.9 Million Award in Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 2{-year-old brain-damaged boy will receive as
much as $25.9 million during his lifetime in the biggest malpractice
settlement in Maryland history, The (Baltimore) Sun reported today.
   The settlement came Tuesday in the sixth day of a trial before
the Health Claims Arbitration Board, which handles malpractice cases
in Maryland.
   The boy, Jerome Durant Jr., was delivered by emergency Caesarean
section at Maryland General Hospital unable to speak, hear, see or
move normally. The toddler functions at the level of a 2-month-old
child, experts said.
   Experts testified that doctors ignored clear signs that his
mother should have been given a Caesarean section when a fetal
monitor indicated the baby's heart was sluggish. Instead, she was
initially given a drug that produced contractions, putting stress on
her womb and depriving the child of adequate blood flow and oxygen.
   The baby was delivered surgically, weighing more than 11 pounds,
unable to breathe and without a heartbeat.
   The boy's mother, Veronica Williams, and her attorneys said they
agreed not to disclose the amount of the settlement, but The Sun
said it includes $581,589 cash and monthly payments of $9,155 with 3
percent annual increases for inflation.
   Ms. Williams said the settlement will enable her to afford
private nurses and therapists, good doctors and expensive equipment
for her child's care.
   ``So far they're saying he will never be able to do any of these
things himself _ walk or feed himself or anything,'' Mrs. Williams
said. ``The last two years have been extremely hard. He takes up all
my time. He's constantly with me. My social life has stopped.''
   Defendants in the malpractice suit included Maryland General
Hospital; Constant Care Health Care System, a medical clinic where
Ms. Williams was enrolled, and obstetricians Sushma Sidh, Ronald
Miles and Thomas Ray.

   Police raided the homes of Moslem
fundamentalists at dawn today and rounded up 61 men on suspicion of
plotting sabotage, security sources said.
   They said officers found two incendiary bombs, many knives and
anti-government leaflets in the homes. The sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The detentions were made under an emergency law enacted after
Moslem extremists assassinated President Anwar Sadat during a
military parade in Cairo on Oct. 6, 1981. Police exercise wide
powers under the law, including detention and search without
warrants. The law also bans strikes and street demonstrations.
   The government blamed Sadat's killing and a subsequent abortive
coup attempt on Jihad, a Moslem extremist group. A nationwide
crackdown on Moslem fundamentalists followed Sadat's assassination,
with thousands detained and hundreds put on trial.
   After being convicted in two trials, five men were executed and
more than 100 received prison terms up to life, which under Egyptian
law is 25 years. Some who received lesser sentences have been
released.
   Fundamentalists want a strict implementation of Sharia, the
Moslem legal and ethical code laid down in the religion's holy book,
the Koran, and in the sayings of the Prophet Mohammed.
   President Hosni Mubarak has said that 90 percent of Egyptian laws
already conform to Sharia.
   Since Sadat's assassination, the government has kept close tabs
on the fundamentalist movement, with a systematic crackdown on those
prone to violence. Officials suspect they are trying to destabilize
the government as a step toward establishing an Iranian-style
religious state.

   Roy Orbison, a balladeer of lost
love whose piercing, three-octive voice on songs like ``Pretty
Woman'' and ``Cryin''' pioneered early rock 'n' roll, died of a
heart attack at age 52.
   The singer-songwriter, known for his black pompadour and
ever-present sunglasses, was brought by ambulance to Hendersonville
Hospital late Tuesday, said Melanie Lamb, a hospital spokeswoman. He
died just before midnight.
   Orbison achieved fame more than two decades ago with the hits
``Only the Lonely,'' his first million-seller, then ``Blue Angel''
and ``I'm Hurtin.''' ``Oh, Pretty Woman,'' in 1964, sold more than 7
million copies, and was recently a hit for the group Van Halen.
   At his death, he was again on the charts, with the single
``Handle With Care,'' a collaboration with artists including Bob
Dylan, George Harrison and Tom Petty. Their album, recorded under
the name The Traveling Wilburys, is No. 8 on the charts.
   Orbison, who played guitar, gave a concert Sunday in Akron, Ohio,
before 2,000 people. On Tuesday, Orbison was at the Nashville-area
home of country singer Jean Shepard, who said he had been with her
husband, ``having a great time.''
   During his heyday in the early 1960s, Orbison had 27 straight
records on the charts. In May 1963, he toured Britain with the
Beatles, then a smash in England but still virtually unknown in the
United States.
   In 1977, Elvis Presley introduced him as ``the greatest singer in
the world.'' Bruce Springsteen saluted him in his song ``Thunder
Road.''
   Orbison once estimated he had sold 30 million records, but added,
``I don't normally keep tabs.''
   Some of his other hits include ``Cryin,''' ``It's Over,'' and
``Blue Bayou.'' Last year, he re-recorded his 1963 hit ``In Dreams''
after the song had been revived in the movie ``Blue Velvet.''
   In a 1986 Associated Press interview, Orbison said the biggest
thrill in his career was ``just being in the business itself.''
   As for being called a legend, he said: ``I did say facetiously
once that being a legend meant being old. But someone pointed out
that not all old people are legends. Anyway, it's nice to have had
longevity and to have influenced a few people for the good.''
   On Sept. 30, 1987, Orbison gave a concert at Los Angeles' Coconut
Grove nightclub, called ``Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black-and-White
Night.'' The friends were Springsteen, Elvis Costello, Jackson
Browne, Tom Waits, T-Bone Burnett and J.D. Souther, with Bonnie
Rait, Jennifer Warnes and K.D. Lang singing backup. The concert was
taped for a cable television special.
   In 1980, Orbison teamed with Emmylou Harris on the duet, ``That
Loving You Feeling Again,'' and earned a Grammy award. He also was
inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame and the Hall of Fame of
the Nashville Songwriters Association.
   Orbison grew up in Wink, Texas, and was taught to play guitar at
age 6 by his father, an oil field worker. He played guitar on a
radio station at age 8 and was in a country music band by age 14.
   He got his early recording experience in the 1950s with Sun
Records of Memphis, the company that launched the careers of
Presley, Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Lewis.
   He was one of the first ``rockabilly'' singers _ a hybrid of rock
'n' roll and hillbilly music, as country music was known then.
   Orbison began wearing sunglasses publicly all the time in 1963
when he accidentally left his regular glasses at home and had to
wear shades while in London. His appearance was well-received and he
kept it a tradition.
   His career plummeted in the late 1960s in the aftermath of two
personal tragedies. His wife died in a motorcycle accident in 1966.
Two of his three sons, ages 10 and 6, died in a fire that destroyed
his $150,000 lakeside home in 1968. His third son is now in his
twenties.
   His most successful songs focused on broken romance and his ``Too
Soon to Know'' was written after the death of his wife. ``A little
hurt went a long way,'' he said in the 1986 interview.
   Orbison remarried and had two sons from that marriage.
   Asked in the 1986 interview how he would like to be remembered,
he replied:
   ``One day when they are mentioning people who had an impact, if
they just mention me among the rest of the guys and gals, it would
be great.''

<HEAD>More Than 90 Guerrilla Groups Uncovered In Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense minister announced today that
Israel's security forces have uncovered 93 guerrilla groups and
arrested more than 600 people believed responsible for scores of
anti-Israeli attacks.
   The groups included a 13-member squad of Israeli Arabs uncovered
Tuesday in the coastal city of Haifa that police blamed for a
grenade attack there in August in which 25 civilians were injured.
   Two of those arrested in Haifa were Bedouin soldiers in the
Israeli army. Police said they suspect the squad planned to kidnap
and kill other soldiers. Bedouins and Druse are the only Arabs
allowed to serve in Israel's army.
   The security operation could help the Israeli army reduce
violence in the occupied lands where Palestinians, led by
underground groups, have been waging an uprising against Israeli
rule. Since the uprising began last December, 319 Palestinians and
11 Israelis have been killed.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin praised Israel's security forces
for uncovering the guerrilla groups believed responsible for 87
anti-Israeli attacks in the past year. He made the comment in a
letter to the head of the Shin Bet security agency.
   Twenty-nine of the guerrilla groups named have been linked to the
Fatah faction of the PLO headed by Yasser Arafat, a Defense Ministry
statement said. Forty-nine were described as locally organized.
   The statement put the number of arrests at 610, including 310 in
the West Bank, 283 in the Gaza Strip and 17 in Israel.
   ``These numbers speak for themselves, your success merits great
praise,'' Rabin said in his letter, according to the ministry
statement. ``The security services conduct their hard work behind a
screen of secrecy and only rarely do their members win gratitude and
praise.''
   ``I see you doing your daily work in the alleys of Nablus,
through Tulkarem, the streets of Gaza and Khan Yunis. I am watching
your efforts made with daring, determination and courage,'' Rabin
said.
   Among the attacks attributed to the groups is an Oct. 31 firebomb
assault on an Israeli passenger bus in the West Bank city of Jericho
that killed a woman and three of her children, the statement said.
   Other attacks include the slayings of at least three Palestinians
accused of collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   Some detainees surrendered weapons, including 16 grenades, 14
pistols, seven rifles, six machine guns and explosives, the
statement said.
   The 13 Israeli Arabs, whose arrests were announced Tuesday, are
among those mentioned by the statement. This group is suspected of
involvement in an Aug. 20 grenade attack in northern Israel in which
an Israeli boy lost a foot and 24 other people were wounded, the
statement said.
   Police said the suspects belonged to Fatah, and that their
leader, identified in news reports as 21-year-old Samir Sarsawi,
joined the Palestine Liberation Organization group while visiting
Egypt a year ago.
   In the occupied territories today, soldiers shot and wounded six
Palestinian teen-agers during at least two confrontations with
stone-throwing demonstrators in the Gaza Strip, hospital officials
said.
   Troops also clamped a curfew on the commercial center of the West
Bank city of Ramallah and detained about 200 Palestinians after a
firebomb was thrown at an Israeli patrol, Arab news reports said.
   In the hills surrounding Kfar Malik near Ramallah, soldiers blew
up caves used as hideouts by Palestinian youths fleeing arrest, news
reports said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.

<HEAD>One-Fourth Of China's Construction Workers Could Lose Their Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One-fourth of China's 24 million construction
workers could lose their jobs next year because of a
government-ordered halt to thousands of building projects, the
official Xinhua News Agency said today.
   The agency quoted Zhang Qinglin, director of the government's
Construction Management Bureau, as saying construction companies
should start finding alternate jobs for their workers.
   In late September, the government ordered a halt to construction
of all hotels, office buildings, stadiums and other projects that
were not part of the five-year economic plan. Only construction of
projects that are more than half-completed is being allowed to
continue.
   The measure is part of an economic package designed to reduce
inflationary borrowing and control economic growth. The October
inflation rate was 26 percent higher than in the corresponding month
of 1987, and officials have said prices are expected to keep rising
this month.
   Provinces and cities nationwide have canceled thousands of
projects in the past two months, including many that have already
been started. The Beijing municipal government said it was ending or
suspending 60 projects worth a total of $429,000. The prosperous
commercial city of Canton canceled the construction of 66 hotels,
restaurants and office projects valued at $456,000.
   A leading construction company in Beijing said it has found new
jobs for all its laid-off workers. However, Xinhua quoted Zhang as
saying the job situation will become critical after March, when many
projects are to be completed.

Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two medical illustrators whose drawings updating
pictures of long-missing children have helped find some of the
youngsters are speeding up their work with computers.
   Lewis Sadler and Scott Barrows of the University of Illinois used
to take 20 hours to prepare a drawing; now, with a computer, they
can do it in about 20 minutes.
   Using old photos, they measure 48 ``anatomical landmarks'' _ nose
size, width of the mouth and spacing of the eyes, for example _ and
expand them to account for growth, producing a picture often
remarkably similar to the child's appearance.
   With a computer, the photographs can be scanned by lasers in
seconds and the facial information transferred into software
programs that create images of missing children as they age.
   John Rabin, deputy director of the National Center for Missing
and Exploited Children in Washington, said Sadler and Barrows'
computerized system will vastly enhance the center's efforts to find
more than 7,500 children.
   ``It's like going from a quill pen to state-of-the-art equipment.
The speed alone is going to be amazing,'' Rabin said.
   Sadler said that the finished product will look more like a
photograph and that the computer isn't as prone to error as humans
in calculating children's features.
   The new computer, supported by a $1.3 million grant from the
American Telephone & Telgraph Co., goes into full-time work in
January, Sadler said Tuesday.
   So far, the data on anatomical landmarks, collected by
anthropologists, dentists and plastic surgeons, is complete enough
only to make pictures of white, non-Hispanic children. Updated
pictures of blacks, Hispanics and Asians will have to wait for more
information.
   The work of the two scientists has drawn national attention.
   Of the approximately 80 missing children drawn by Sadler and
Barrows since they began their work in 1985, 24 of the children have
been found, Sadler said. Of those, the drawings played at least some
role in 17 cases, he said.
   In one case, their drawing of a 13-year-old girl who had been
missing since she was 3 was the clue that brought her home.
   In another case, two sisters missing for 7{ years were located
just 20 minutes after drawings by Sadler and Barrows were broadcast
on national television.

<TEXT>
   Former Beatle Paul McCartney, whose rock group
stole the limelight from Roy Orbison during a 1963 tour of Britain,
said today the singer-songwriter was ``one of the greats of rock 'n'
roll.''
   When the Beatles opened their national tour on May 18, 1963,
Orbison topped the bill. But by the end of the 21-concert itinerary,
the ballad-singing Texan had been eclipsed by the Fab Four.
   Orbison died of a heart attack aged 52 in Hendersonville, Tenn.,
on Tuesday night.
   McCartney said in a statement released by his publicist that
Orbison's death ``is a great shock.''
   ``We toured with Roy in the early days and he was a really good
guy,'' the 46-year-old McCartney said. ``It is particularly sad when
he seemed to be enjoying such a comeback recently.
   ``He was and always will be one of the greats of rock 'n' roll,''
he said.
   Orbison traveled to Britain last month to promote an album
compilation of his hit songs and an album he made with former Beatle
George Harrison, singers Bob Dylan, Tom Petty and others, under the
name ``The Traveling Wilburys.''
   Orbison told reporters on his departure from London's Heathrow
Airport on Nov. 30 he was surprised at the recent upturn in his
career.
   ``I've been taken aback by the way things are going,'' Orbison
said.
   ``I've been rediscovered by young kids who had never heard of me
before the Wilburys,'' he said. ``They are getting into my original
songs and apparently the old stuff is selling at the rate of 20,000
copies a day.''
   ``It's very nice to be wanted again but I still can't quite
believe it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush offered former
House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill the job of ambassador to Ireland, a
post in which the Massachusetts Democrat once expressed an interest,
but O'Neill turned it down for personal reasons, a Bush aide
confirmed today.
   Transition press secretary Sheila Tate said that Bush was
disappointed O'Neill declined the offer, made during a private
meeting Friday, because the vice president felt O'Neill ``would have
been a wonderful ambassador.''
   The offer was first reported in today's editions of the Boston
Globe.
   Ms. Tate confirmed the accuracy of the account, saying, ``The
vice president did indeed offer the ambassadorship to Tip O'Neill.''
   The post is held by Margaret Heckler, a former congresswoman from
Massachusetts.
   O'Neill, 76, told the newspaper that he met with Bush and his
wife, Barbara, but did not discuss details of the session.
   One factor in O'Neill's decision was the health of his wife,
Millie, the Globe said. O'Neill told the newspaper Tuesday that she
was suffering from pneumonia.
   Ms. Tate said O'Neill ``felt, apparently quite regrettably, that
he would be unable to serve because of concern for his wife.''
   When O'Neill left office in 1986, he told reporters that the only
other government service he might consider would be the job of
ambassador to Ireland, suggesting it was a post he had often thought
of fondly.
   However, when President Reagan mentioned press speculation over
such an appointment, O'Neill jokingly replied:
   ``What? And have your picture on the wall of my office? No way.''

<HEAD>Foreign Office Suspends Official for Criticizing Thatcher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Office said it suspended a second
secretary today for criticizing Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in
a letter published in The Guardian newspaper.
   Patrick J. Haseldine, who has served in France and West Africa,
is likely to face severe disciplinary action for breaching civil
service strictures against expressing political opinions.
   He accused Mrs. Thatcher of ``self-righteous invective'' in
attacks on Belgium and Ireland for their failure to extradite an
Irish priest suspected of terrorism.
   The letter also charged Mrs. Thatcher connived to let four white
South Africans suspected of arms smuggling go free in 1984.
   ``It is all very well for Mrs. Thatcher to inveigh against the
Belgians and the Irish with such self-righteous invective,'' the
letter said. ``In the not too distant past her allegations of being
soft on terrorism and allowing political considerations to override
the due legal process could have been leveled against Mrs. Thatcher
herself.''
   It cited the case of the four South Africans who were granted
$540,000 bail by a magistrate in Coventry, central England, and
allowed to return to South Africa.
   The South African government, which provided the bail, refused to
send them back and forfeited the money.
   ``Mrs. Thatcher failed to denounce Mr. Botha's refusal to
surrender the four,'' the letter added.
   The Foreign Office said Haseldine has been suspended pending an
investigation.
   Mrs. Thatcher has accused the Belgian and Irish governments of
failing to live up to anti-terrorist declarations over the
extradition of the priest, the Rev. Patrick Ryan. British police
suspect him of involvement in Irish Republican Army bombings.
   Belgium, where Ryan was arrested last summer, refused a British
extradition request this month and sent him to the Republic of
Ireland, which says it is still considering the issue.

   A sheriff's deputy suspected of making
threatening telephone calls to state troopers and taking potshots at
law officers was shot to death after daring authorities to try to
capture her, officials said.
   Elizabeth Laperouse, 22, of St. Martinville, a dispatcher for the
St. Martin Parish Sheriff's Office, was gunned down Tuesday night on
a desolate road near the Atchafalaya Swamp, said State Police
spokesman Lt. Ronnie Jones.
   ``Investigators were told last night that when she came to work
yesterday, she was acting somewhat irrationally,'' Jones said. ``I
think the words they used were `stressed out.'''
   The woman was told to go home, and superiors took her pistol from
her, but she apparently got another from a friend, Jones said.
   The woman apparently called a State Police post in Lafayette and
warned, ``I'm across the street, and I'm going to shoot the first
trooper who comes out of the building,'' Jones said.
   The woman fired at a trooper and another officer leaving the
building, Jones said. Neither was hurt. Shen then sped off in a car,
the lieutenant said.
   About an hour later, the caller asked, ``Did you hear the
shots?'' gave a highway location and added, ``I dare any trooper to
try to stop me,'' Jones said.
   State police pursued the car onto an empty stretch of road, where
she stopped and jumped from her car, Jones said.
   ``After being told to drop her weapon, she began to make
offensive moves, and two shots were fired, one striking her in the
head,'' Jones said.
   He said investigators determined that State Police acted properly.

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake centered in the southern Soviet
Union today caused damage in at least five Soviet cities and killed
four people in eastern Turkey, authorities said.
   Official Yerevan Radio, in a report monitored in London, said
there were unspecified Soviet ``casualties and injuries'' from the
quake, which was centered near the Armenian city of Leninakan near
the Soviet-Turkish border.
   Extensive damage was reported in Turkey.
   The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake registered 6.9 on the
Richter scale and its epicenter was just south of Tbilisi, capital
of the Soviet republic of Georgia and a city of nearly 1 million
people.
   Armenia is just south of Tbilisi.
   The official Tass news agency, quoting the Moscow Central Seismic
Station, put the epicenter 30 miles from Leninakan, a city of
200,000 people some 95 miles northwest of Yerevan.
   Tass reported the quake ``caused destruction in Leninakan.
Details of the earthquake consequences are being determined.''
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev, asked at a
news briefing about the earthquake, said it also had affected the
area of Kirovakan just to the east of Leninakan. He did not provide
details.
   Yerevan Radio said there was damage Korovakan, as well as in the
cities of Gugark, Stepanavan, and Spitak.
   Tass said tremors were felt throughout the southern Caucasus
region.
   The quake registered 8 on the Soviet scale of one to 12, which
measures tremors on the basis of their visible effects, said Tamara
Levkina, an official of the National Earthquake Center in Moscow.
   An earthquake with an intensity of 8 is described in Soviet
reference works as ``destructive,'' causing ``cracks on sharp slopes
and in wet soils. Monuments are moved or turned over. Houses are
considerably damaged.''
   Ms. Levkina said communications with Leninakan were knocked out.
The quake was felt in Tbilisi and the Armenian capital of Yerevan at
a force level of 5, she said. That intensity has the power to shake
buildings and break windows.
   An editor of the official Armenpress news agency in Yerevan said
``everything in the building shook'' when the quake hit but that
there were no reports of damage in the Armenian capital.
   Armenian environmentalists have said a nuclear power plant near
Yerevan is located on a geological fault and have demanded it be
closed because of the danger of earthquakes. Yerevan radio said the
power plant wasn't damaged.
   State Turkish radio quoted Kars provincial Gov. Hasan Fakir as
saying four residents of the town of Akyaka were killed in the
quake. Many houses were damaged in Akyaka and in the nearby Cildir
township, it said.
   The Kandilli observatory in Istanbul, reached by telephone, said
the quake shook four eastern Turkish provinces this morning.
   In Washington, D.C., David Terrell of the Geological Survey said
the quake was measured by American seismologists at 6.9 and its
epicenter was about 50 miles southwest of Tbilisi. A quake of that
magnitude is capable of causing widespread, heavy damage.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said the geophysics
department at Tehran University had measured the quake at 6.8 on the
Richter scale.
   The agency said it was centered 600 miles northwest of Tehran.
Iran's border with Turkey and the Soviet Union is about 450 miles
northwest of Tehran.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.

   Robinson also is charged with murder in a 1986 slaying near in
Greenville, S.C.
   The agents Tuesday sought documents dealing with his operation of
several Wendy's restaurants, said his lawyer, Jerome Rotenberg.
   Officials are looking into allegations that cash was skimmed from
the restaurants, the Chicago Tribune reported today, quoting an
unidentified source.
   Robinson is being held without bail in Greenville on charges of
hiring El Rukn street gang members to kill Leroy ``Hambone'' Barber
in 1986. Robinson is scheduled for trial in January.
   He has said he is innocent of the charges and that they and the
investigation into his business dealings were prompted by Jackson's
political success.
   The former Democratic presidential candidate has said he has had
little contact with Robinson in recent years.

   President Reagan said today that he and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would continue their ``quest for
human rights and personal freedom'' when they hold lunchtime talks
this afternoon on Governors Island.
   The 2{-hour meeting is concluding a relationship between the two
superpower leaders that has mellowed since their first summit three
years ago.
   President-elect George Bush is joining the pair at the luncheon
table.
   ``Although our time together will be brief, I welcome this
opportunity for a final meeting between myself, President Gorbachev
and Vice President Bush that will demonstrate the continuity of the
process that we first put in place in Geneva in 1985,'' Reagan told
reporters as he prepared to leave for Governors Island and his fifth
and final summit with the Kremlin leader.
   He said, ``The quest for human rights and personal freedom is
very much a part of the agenda of the American-Soviet relations.''
   Today's meeting was one that Reagan did not anticipate when he
visited Moscow last summer and withdrew ``evil empire'' from his
political vocabulary.
   For Reagan, in the twilight of his presidency, the trip to New
York could be the sentimental culmination to a relationship that
overcame his distrust of most things Soviet.
   The relationship reached a high point last summer on the streets
of Moscow, where Gorbachev introduced his American guest to startled
Russians. At one point, he gathered a small boy into his arms and
said, ``Shake hands with grandfather Reagan.''
   Reagan, reminded that he had described the Soviet Union as an
``evil empire'' that was not to be trusted, dismissed that as a
comment ``about another time, another era.''
   Today's meeting also gave Reagan's wife Nancy a chance to patch
things up with Raisa Gorbachev _ a rival with whom, Mrs. Reagan has
acknowledged, she was not in sync. The two ladies were to have a
final lunch together as their husbands met.
   Before flying to New York on Tuesday, Mrs. Reagan contended that
the Nancy-Raisa feud was a reporters' invention, or at least an
exaggeration.
   ``You all keep saying that there's ... fussing and feuding, but
there really isn't,'' she said. ``I think there's been too much
attention paid to it.''
   Reagan planned to return to Washington this evening and address
the American Enterprise Institute, probably using that forum to sum
up his talk with Gorbachev.
   Reagan also scheduled a news conference for prime time Thursday
evening _ probably his last such meeting with the White House press
corps.
   Mrs. Reagan, talking with reporters as she accepted delivery of
the White House Christmas tree, admonished them, ``Be nice. It's his
last one.''
   Reagan leaves office Jan. 20, relinquishing the White House to
Bush, who was traveling separately to New York for the meeting with
Gorbachev.
   Reagan and Gorbachev first met in Geneva in 1985 and made some
progress toward agreement on arms control.
   They conferred again at Reykjavik, Iceland, in October 1986, at a
meeting that was initially billed as ``not a summit'' but turned
into an extended bargaining session over a Gorbachev proposal for a
dramatic slash of 30 to 50 percent in each of the superpowers'
arsenals of strategic arms. Last-minute disagreement over Reagan's
Star Wars program blocked any agreement and left American officials
dejected.
   An arms control agreement was reached at the next
Reagan-Gorbachev meeting, in Washington in December, 1987. It
provided for the actual destruction of nuclear weapons with each
nation observing that unprecedented act.
   Further arms control agreements eluded the two leaders in Moscow
last June, but they cemented their personal relationship and Reagan
used the Kremlin as a pulpit for preaching the virtues of democracy
and freedom.

   The Indianapolis Star on the B-2 bomber:
   The Air Force's new B-2 stealth bomber may be a technological
military wonder, but it costs too much.
   The sophisticated plane, 10 years in development, is intended for
attacks on the Soviet mobile-missile force. Its radar-proof design
is intended to enable it to penetrate far into Soviet airspace, and
find and destroy missile-launchers.
   However, the technology it is supposed to use to find the
missiles does not yet exist.
   The price of a single B-2 is more than $500 million. The cost of
a fleet of 132 B-2s and their base equipment is reportedly $57
billion. ...
   This is an astronomic price _ unduly high considering that huge
fleets of advanced cruise missiles would probably be able to perform
the same kind of mission at a fraction of the cost.
   We hope that the Bush administration and the new Congress will
give the B-2 program a long, hard look.

   St. Louis Post-Dispatch on political campaigns:
   As the echoes of blistering invective from the campaign continue
to fade, President-elect George Bush has made a wide-ranging effort
at mending fences, indicating he may really plan to be president of
all the people.
   If his round of conciliatory post-election meetings is a
harbinger of his behavior after Inauguration Day, the Bush
administration could bring some welcome surprises. ...
   It's easy to be gracious in victory, of course, and ... Bush
should not think that his program of outreach will entirely erase
the memory of his bitter attacks on his opponents during the
ill-tempered campaign.
   But if he can follow the symbolic meetings he has had in recent
days with substantive action, perhaps a kinder and gentler
administration will take root in Washington after all.

   The Miami News on U.S.-Cuba relations:
   U.S. Sen. Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, called for the normalization of U.S.-Cuba
relations after returning from a five-day trip to the island at the
end of last month.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will meet with Cuban boss Fidel
Castro this weekend in Havana where they will discuss normalizing
Soviet-Cuban relations.
   Now that we have everyone's attention, the Pell and Gorbachev
visits deserve a harder look because they are related.
   The Democratic senator from Rhode Island is serious about
breaking down the barriers between Cuba and the United States, about
restoring diplomatic relations between the two countries, and
debating whether to lift the trade embargo which can be more
official than real, and sometimes paper-thin.

   St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press Dispatch on Iran-Contra:
   President Reagan last week wisely rejected pardons for either
Oliver North or John Poindexter, the key defendants in the
Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages case. The president has ... praised
them for their ``patriotism'' and said he believes the justice
system will exonerate them.
   Yet his subsequent action belies that belief. In one breath, he
ruled out pardons; in another, he blocked the progress of a fair
trial.
   The president refused to disclose information about the case that
... North says he needs to build his defense. The White House,
(Reagan) said, has a ``duty'' to protect ``state secrets of the
highest order.''
   But withholding that sensitive material could result in dismissal
of the conspiracy charges. Should that happen, the public will never
know whether crimes were committed. Justice would not be served.
   The president denies that he is attempting a ``back door''
approach to pardoning the principals in the scandal, but it has the
same effect. It appears that ... Reagan's goal is to clear the men,
but avoid taking direct responsibility.
   Americans should not be fooled by such subterfuge.

   Asbury Park (N.J.) Press on the rise in air fares:
   The nation's major airlines almost in unison decided ... to
charge more for their services. Out went most discounted ... fares
and in came ticket price increases of up to 30 percent.
   Since deregulation, competition has led to major mergers and the
demise of more than 100 small airlines.
   Uncle Sam has done little to stand in the way of acquisitions
that have placed control of two-thirds of all domestic flights in
the hands of eight carriers, several of which also control airports
and reservation systems.
   The round of fare increases and rising prices in other industries
may be just the beginning _ unless the government more vigorously
enforces antitrust laws.

   Saginaw (Mich.) News on taking pennies out of circulaton:
   U.S. Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., wants to take the pennies out of
our pockets _ and our loafers, piggybanks and junk drawers, too.
Kolbe has introduced a bill requiring the Treasury Department to
take pennies out of circulation. ...
   Merchants wouldn't mind seeing the shiny brown pieces become a
symbol of nostalgia. Some already place saucers of pennies near cash
registers to avoid delays caused when customers dig in pockets and
purses for correct change.
   Our problem is that Kolbe's bill would round off purchases to the
nearest nickel. If you offered a penny for our thoughts, we would
receive nothing.
   Disneyland still has old-time Moviola machines that cost one cent
to operate. After paying a couple thousand pennies for admission, a
vacationer deserves a break.
   And ``Nickels from Heaven'' would not be a song that would stir
our fancy.
   So let's keep our pennies. Those who don't like them can invite
us to keep the change.

   Herald-Dispatch, Huntington, W.Va., on Bob Dole's role in the
Senate:
   President-elect George Bush and Sen. Bob Dole ``kissed and made
up'' ... _ for the time being. Insiders predict it will be
impossible for Dole to bite his tongue for the next four years.
   Back when they were political equals on the wintry campaign trail
in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two were at each others' throats. Now
that Bush has grabbed the brass ring, Dole must be satisfied with an
attendant role as Senate minority leader.
   In that role, his first assignment will be to embrace the new
president's claim that the nation's $155 billion budget deficit can
be reduced significantly without new taxes.
   His doubts about that proposition are well known and it seems
only a matter of time before he finds some embarrassing riposte that
will torpedo this chummy relationship with the White House.
   The GOP must swim upstream in the Democratic-controlled 101st
Congress, so Dole's cooperation would be a plus for the Bush
administration.
   Bush proved his chameleon qualities when he swallowed his pride
and disappeared in President Reagan's shadow eight years ago. Dole
is more stubborn and less restrained, so be surprised if he finds
this kind of political fidelity too demanding and kicks the traces.

   The Milwaukee Journal on college athletes:
   In their quest to win careers as professional football or
basketball players, too many college students are setting themselves
up for failure in life. That's the sad but clear message that
emerges from a new study of 4,083 students at 42 major U.S. colleges
and universities.
   The $1.75 million study was conducted for the National Collegiate
Athletic Association.
   It found that major college football and basketball players spend
more time on their sports during the season than they do studying
and attending class. ...
   To anyone who follows college sports, these findings come as no
surprise. But they do provide a factual basis for action by the
NCAA, and action is needed.
   When college students spend more time on sports than on academic
work, they twist their priorities, and so do the schools they
attend. ...
   For athletes as for others, a rewarding life in this complex era
requires an education _ not necessarily a college education, but at
least a skill that will not become obsolete fairly quickly. That's
why students need to spend most of their time studying.
   When they neglect the development of these lasting skills, they
are doing themselves no favor. And colleges that permit such
distorted priorities aren't helping, either.

nation by a commission of presidents of the nation's largest
colleges and universities.
   The NCAA Presidents Commission ... surveyed 4,083 college
athletes and students from 42 of the largest colleges and
universities.
   The research showed jocks spend an average of 30 hours a week on
their football and basketball sports, while they spend only 12 hours
studying and 14 hours in classes.
   College presidents need to find something to do to fill out their
idle days, obviously. ...
   The only differences between college jocks and college students
is that the students are preparing for a later job. The jocks
already have one, though the pay is convoluted because of the
hypocrisy surrounding the job.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's
departure remarks as he left Washington today for his meeting in New
York with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   I have a brief statement here. I am delighted that later today,
I'll have the opportunity to welcome President Gorbachev to the
United States, and extend to him the hospitality and good wishes of
the American people.
   As most of you know, our meeting today is under the gaze of Lady
Liberty, and I think that's altogether appropriate. The quest for
human rights and personal freedom is very much a part of the agenda
of American-Soviet relations.
   And let me also say that since they began in 1985, my discussions
with President Gorbachev have been friendy, businesslike, and
productive. And although our time together today will be brief, I
welcome this opportunity for a final meeting between myself,
President Gorbachev, and Vice President Bush, that will demonstrate
the continuity of the process we first put in place at Geneva in
1985.
   The pursuit of peace is, of course, always in season, but I think
it's especially appropriate that President Gorbachev should be here
at this time of year, a time when the thoughts and prayers of all of
us turn to the hope that someday nations and people from every part
of the world will live in peace and harmony with one another. It's
for this reason that I journey to New York, and thank you, and God
bless you.
   Q. What about Mr. Arafat?
   Q. Mr. President, what kind of troop reductions are being offered
by the Soviets?
   A. What?
   Q. Troop reductions by the Soviets?
   A. Well, we're pleased to hear that, but that would _ that
they're thinking in that term. We, too, have thought in it, and the
idea of bringing conventional weapons down, achieving a symmetry
between us, I think would be another great forward step.
   Q. Yasser Arafat?
   A. What?
   Q. Yasser Arafat?
   A. Well, we haven't had time yet, because he held his press
conference just _ up until just a short time ago in Sweden, and we
haven't had time to review what it is that he said there
specifically. And we're looking forward to that.
   So I have to get going now, because I can't be late for my
luncheon.

   PLO leader Yasser Arafat today said he
told a group of American Jews that his organization accepts Israel's
right to exist and condemns all forms of terrorism.
   But he told a press conference that a two-page declaration
drafted with the Jewish group ``is nothing new'' from the
resolutions adopted by the PLO's parliament-in-exile last month.
   He repeatedly avoided answering questions on whether PLO attacks
against Israel were terrorism, but said resistance against
occupation was legitimate under the U.N. charter.
   Foreign Minister Sten Andersson announced the declaration, saying
it was intended to elaborate on the PLO's acceptance last month of
two U.N. resolutions, which implicitly recognize Israel.
   Andersson said that according to the statement, the Palestine
National Council ``established the independent state of Palestine
and accepted the existence of Israel as a state in the region.''
   The statement, released in English, said the PLO also ``declared
its rejection and condemnation of terrorism in all its forms,
including state terrorism.''
   But the Palestine National Council spoke of limiting ``military
action'' to Israel and the occupied territories in its meeting in
Algiers, Algeria. Israel contended the council did not recognize
Israel and had not outlawed terrorism.
   Today's declaration mentioned U.N. resolutions 242 and 338 as the
basis for an international Middle East peace conference, in which
the PLO wants to participate.
   But it did not refer to the resolutions in relation to the
recognition of Israel's right to exist or an end to terrorism.
   The five-member Jewish delegation hailed the document as ``an
important step forward in the peace process'' which removed the
ambiguities from the PLO council's declaration last month.
   ``With this clarification of what were ambiguities in the Algiers
document, we hope fervently that the United States will open a
dialogue with the PLO,'' said Rita Hauser of the International
Center for Peace in the Middle East.
   Washington has made recognition of Israel and renunciation of
terrorism conditions for dealing with the PLO.
   President Reagan, asked about today's declaration as he was
leaving the White House for New York, said: ``We haven't had time to
review what it is that he (Arafat) said there specifically.''
   Arafat held six hours of talks Tuesday with the Jewish delegation
led by Ms. Hauser, whose leftist coalition advocates that Israel
give up part of its occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The meeting came a week before Arafat's speech to a special
session of the U.N. General Assembly in Geneva. He is expected to
seek support there for the Palestinian state proclaimed last month
by the Palestine National Council.
   The U.N. session was moved to Geneva after the United States
denied Arafat an entry visa.
   In Jerusalem, Israel's Foreign Ministry today said the American
Jews who met with Arafat could not be regarded as representatives of
any major Jewish organization in the United States or Israel.
``These people represent only themselves,'' the ministry said.
   Jewish leaders in the United States and Sweden also dismissed the
Jewish delegation as unrepresentative.
   U.N. Resolution 242 primarily calls for withdrawal of Israeli
armed forces from occupied territories and the end of all
hostilities in the Middle East, with all states recognizing the
rights of the others to ``live in peace within secure and recognized
boundaries free from threats or acts of force.''
   Resolution 338 calls on all parties to begin implementing
Resolution 242 and urges negotiations between the parties for ``a
just and durable peace in the Middle East.''
   Arafat today also said the yearlong uprising in the
Israeli-occupied territories justified by what he called Israeli
terrorism. He said it would continue.
   At least 319 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have died in the
rebellion against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, taken by Israel during the 1967 Middle East War.

<TEXT>
   The Estonian parliament adopted a
constitutional amendment today making Estonian the state language,
but it postponed action on a law that would force the republic's
Russian residents to learn the language.
   The vote on the amendment was 204-49 with four abstentions. That
was 14 more than the two-thirds required to pass a constitutional
amendment.
   It was the widest margin of disagreement yet in the Estonian
parliament, officially called the Supreme Soviet, which has only
recently begun to debate issues that it once rubber-stamped.
   The proposed law would have required non-native workers including
police, shop clerks and doctors to learn Estonian.
   Many migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union have not
learned the local language even after years of residence in the tiny
republic on the Baltic Sea. The law will be reconsidered in January.
   The language proposal generated considerable controversy.
   Many of the Russian migrants preferred not to learn a new
language, and the native population feared it would soon be
outnumbered in its own homeland and that its language and culture
would die.
   A Russian organization called Intermovement denounced the
language proposal as divisive. At a rally last week, some of its
members went so far as to call it an incitement to ``ethnic hatred.''
   Hundreds of thousands of Russians poured into Estonia for
well-paid factory jobs, largely from now nearly deserted farming
villages, said Estonian engineer Martin Kuusk. ``If they want to
stay, they must absorb our culture,'' he said. ``If they do not want
to learn, their country is in the neighborhood.''
   A Supreme Soviet deputy with the Russian name of Mayakovsky
suggested adding a line defining Russian as the ``international
language of the Soviet Union.'' But the proposal was defeated by a
vote of 141-35.
   The former leader of Estonia, Communist Party First Secretary
Karl Vaino, knew little of the republic's language, and for most of
the 1980s all government documents were written only in Russian.
Vaino was replaced last summer by a reformer and native Estonian,
Vaino Vyalyas.
   Estonia joins four other republics that declared state languages.
The nearby Baltic republic of Lithuania passed its law in recent
weeks. Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia have had similar
constitutional amendments since 1978.
   At a special meeting of the Estonian Communist Party this
morning, recently elected Prime Minister Indrek Toome resigned his
party job as ideology secretary. He was replaced by Mikk Titma, one
of four men who devised Estonia's currently debated proposal for
economic reform.
   Titma's elevation to the party secretariat was a dramatic
promotion because he had not even been a member of the party's
Central Committee.
   On Tuesday, Estonia's parliament banned further industrial
development in an ecologically devastated area of the republic,
putting itself on a collision course with Moscow ministries.
   The action marked a first exercise of the republic's newly
declared sovereignty in all but military and foreign policy matters.
   The republic's parliament on Nov. 16 declared Estonia's
sovereignty over all its internal affairs. In Moscow, the executive
council of the national parliament promptly deemed the action
illegal.
   But the Estonians, who number 1.6 million, have refused to abide
by the Kremlin directive and their parliament has even amended the
republic's constitution to give it the power to veto Soviet laws.
   Estonian officials have used that veto power cautiously.
   On Tuesday, they postponed plans to override two controversial
nationwide decrees limiting demonstrations and dissent, deciding to
ignore the decrees and instead enforce a more liberal Estonian law.

   A land mine explosion and repeated attacks
by rebels killed seven people on a truck convoy carrying food to the
southern Sudan town of Juba, a U.N. official said today.
   The attacks in the jungles north of the Uganda border came
despite the signing of a peace agreement last month between the
rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army and a party in Sudan's
governing coalition.
   Planes flying with safety guarantees from both sides were not
attacked as they carried supplies to starving civilians in
government-held and rebel-controlled towns for a fourth day.
   The south's 6 million civilians have been the main victims of the
civil war. Relief officials said today that new information leads
them to believe that at least 500,000 people have died this year.
   Most perished while trying to flee the battle zone for safety or
food because the war has driven them from their agricultural lands.
Previous estimates had put the year's civilian death toll at 260,000.
   The U.N. official, in daily radio contact with Juba, 750 miles
south of Khartoum, said the civilian convoy of 25 to 30 trucks left
Yei, 100 miles southwest of Juba, on Thursday.
   Except for a few U.N. trucks, it carried food owned by merchants,
not relief supplies, he said. Despite an army escort, the trucks
``encountered five, maybe six, ambushes by the SPLA,'' he said on
condition of anonymity.
   He said three civilians and a soldier died in the attacks, which
were carried out with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled
grenades. He said three other civilians died and 14 were wounded
later when a truck hit a land mine.All the victims were Sudanese.
   ``As far as we can tell, the food remains intact,'' the official
said. ``Our offices also have a few trucks carrying supplies to
Juba, which are OK.
   ``This morning they were 44 miles away from Juba. This is a
100-mile journey, which should take five hours, but it takes ages
because they move at a walking pace to let men with manual mine
detectors proceed in front of them.''
   The attacks came as the government assembled a delegation to send
to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to meet with renegade Col. John Garang,
the rebel leader.
   He organized his rebellion in 1983 to press for a better
economic, political and administrative deal for the non-Moslem
majority in southern Sudan. The Moslem-dominated central government
imposed Islamic law six months later, which exacerbated the war.

   A maintenance worker found 154 pounds of
cocaine stashed above a ceiling panel in the rest room of an empty
Pan Am plane, an airline spokeswoman said.
   The drugs were discovered Tuesday evening, about 45 minutes after
the plane arrived at San Francisco International Airport from Miami
via Los Angeles, said spokeswoman Susan Timper.
   The airline gave no estimate of the value of the cocaine, but
such a quantity would normally be worth millions of dollars.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration searched the plane and found
no additional cocaine, Timper said. The plane was later released to
the airline and returned to service this morning.
   A secretary at DEA today said the agency had no immediate comment.
   Ms. Timper said the ceiling panel is routinely removed for
service between flights.

<TEXT>
   A motorist's excuse that he was bugged by an
insect moments before his car collided with a tractor just won't
fly, an appeals court ruled in ordering a new trial in a lawsuit
against him.
   A jury had decided Verryl Bunnell was not negligent in the 1986
accident that fractured the knee of 22-year-old Rose M. Garceau, and
it awarded Garceau $118,500 in damages. Garceau, who had asked for
$200,000, sought a new trial.
   Bunnell contended that an insect flew into his car and struck his
cheek as he approached a rise in the highway. As he swatted the
insect, he said, he drove his car into the opposite lane and struck
the tractor operated by Garceau.
   But an appeals court Tuesday said, ``Bunnell's testimony fails to
support a finding that a bug striking his cheek leaving his vision
unobstructed creates a danger.''
   Even if Bunnell was stung by the bug, the court said, he was
never placed in an emergency situation.

<HEAD>Program Reduces Caesareans to Half National Rate, Could Save $1
Billion</HEAD>

   A hospital reduced its Caesarean births to half the
national rate by requiring doctors to get second opinions and follow
a few easy rules in a strategy that could save more than $1 billion
if applied everywhere, its developers said.
   Caesarean sections are the most common form of surgery in the
United States. Many medical experts agree that physicians perform
far too many of them, but there is little consensus on how to cut
back.
   The program started at Chicago's Mount Sinai Hospital Medical
Center lowered the Caesarean rate from 17.5 percent of births to
11.5 percent over two years. Nationwide last year, 24.4 percent of
the 3.8 million births were Caesarean deliveries.
   ``We lowered it not from 24 to 17 percent, but from 17 to 11
percent, which is even harder to do,'' said Dr. Stephen A. Myers.
``It's like going on a diet. The first five pounds are easy. The
last five pounds are tough.''
   A report on the program, developed by Myers and Dr. Norbert
Gleicher, was published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   The hospital set these rules:
   _ Except in emergencies, second opinions must be obtained before
all Caesareans.
   _ Vaginal deliveries are preferred for all patients who have
undergone previous Caesareans.
   _ Difficult birth is considered to be an acceptable reason for a
Caesarean only if a women fails to deliver after two hours of
strong, regular uterine contractions.
   _ Fetal distress must be confirmed by a blood sample drawn from
the fetus.
   _ Vaginal deliveries are recommended for nearly all breech
births, those in which the baby appears bottom first.
   A peer review process was set up to make sure that all doctors
follow the rules. Those who seem to be performing too many
Caesareans are notified, although no disciplinary action is taken.
   The doctors estimated that if their program were adopted by other
hospitals, the United States could avoid 450,000 Caesareans
nationally. Hospitals charge about $3,000 more for Caesareans than
for vaginal births, and doctors charge $250 to $500 more.
   At Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, Dr. Benjamin Sachs said
doctors frequently do Caesareans at the first sign of fetal
distress, because they fear they will be sued for malpractice if
anything goes wrong.
   ``I don't think what they have done in this particular hospital
is going to be easy to duplicate in the environment that we have
today,'' he said.
   In an editorial, Dr. Frederick C. Battaglia of the University of
Colorado questioned whether the Chicago doctors paid enough
attention to the safety of sharply reducing Caesareans.
   The doctors said the reduction made no difference in the death
rate among babies or mothers. Although there were more reports of
depressed breathing among infants, they said this was probably
because doctors were more alert to this problem, not because of a
true increase in its occurrence.
   Myers said doctors at the hospital were generally enthusiastic
about the program, although some women were unhappy when told they
could not have Caesarean sections.
   ``Some women say: `I don't want to go through that aggravation. I
want another Caesarean section,''' Myers said. ``But because they
say it, that's not a valid reason to do it. We said, `No, we are
going to have a trial of labor.'''
   Experts once recommended that after an initial Caesarean, women
undergo the operation for all later births. In recent years,
however, this advice has changed.
   At the Chicago hospital, 87 percent of all women with previous
Caesareans underwent some labor. Of these, 70 percent gave birth
vaginally.

   Two weeks of torrential rains, floods and
mudslides in western Uganda have left about 5,000 people homeless, a
government official said Wednesday.
   Tents and shelter material are urgently needed for the displaced
families, said Nathan Masaba, secretary of the Ministry of Social
Relief and Rehabilitation.
   The government has delivered tents, 500 blankets, 1,000 bags of
corn flour and 100 bags of beans to victims in the mountainous
Bundibugyo district, about 200 miles west of Kampala, Masaba said.

<HEAD>Senate Majority Leader To Visit Tiny Town That Backed His Opponent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tiny Talmadge, the only one of Maine's
672 voting precincts to reject U.S. Sen. George J. Mitchell in the
Nov. 8 election, will get a visit this week from the new Senate
majority leader.
   Mitchell, who returned in triumph Tuesday to his hometown of
Waterville, plans to spend the rest of the week in Maine. He plans a
stop Thursday in Talmadge, the Washington County community that
voted 18-12 for Republican Jasper Wyman in the Senate race in which
Mitchell swept 81 percent of the vote.
   Mitchell, a Democrat appointed to the Senate in 1980 and elected
in 1982, wrote letters to Talmadge residents and plans to meet them
in the basement of the Bethel Chapel, said Town Clerk Gail Thornton.
   ``He just wants to know anything that's on their mind, anything
that bothered them that he didn't do,'' she said. The town has 36
registered voters, many of them elderly Republicans.
   At his first stop, Mitchell was cheered by relatives and friends,
many of whom have known him since his childhood in Waterville's Head
of Falls neighborhood across the Kennebec River from City Hall.
   ``This is a very moving moment for me,'' he told more than 100
well-wishers who jammed the lobby of City Hall.
   After brief remarks, the senator was presented with a white
T-shirt that read, ``From Head of the Falls to Head of the Senate.''
   Mitchell, 55, defeated fellow Democratic Sens. J. Bennett
Johnston of Louisiana and Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii to win the
powerful majority leader's post last week.
   Former Sen. Margaret Chase Smith, the 90-year-old matriarch of
Maine's Republican Party, joined Mitchell on the podium in the lobby
and praised his integrity.
   ``He gives you the feeling of being direct and honest. That's a
great asset for a politician,'' she said.

   Pollutants from a chemical plant leaked
into a Romanian river that flows into a waterway in southern
Hungary, the state news agency reported.
   The pollutants in the Maros River, which flows into the Tisza
River, came from a plant about 30 miles east of the Hungarian
border, the agency MTI said.
   The Lower Tisza Environmental Protection and Water Management
Directorate has declared an alert for the Hungarian section of the
Maros, the report said.
   In July, chemical waste in the Szamos River in Romania flowed
into Hungary, killing thousands of fish. Romanian officials denied
they were aware of the pollution on their side of the border.

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: that fact.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   But equally, there is no escaping the need to find a balance of
interests within an international framework, which has become a
condition for survival and progress.
   Pondering all this, one comes to the conclusion that if we are to
take into account the lessons of the past and the realities of the
present, if we are to reckon with the objective logic of world
development, we must look for ways to improve the international
situation and build a new world _ and we must do it together.
   And, if so, we ought to agree on the basic, truly universal
prerequisites and principles of such action.
   It is obvious, for instance, that the use or threat of force no
longer can or must be an instrument of foreign policy. This applies
above all to nuclear arms, but that is not the only thing that
matters. All of us, and primarily the stronger of us, must exercise
self-restraint and totally rule out any outward-oriented use of
force.
   That is the first and the most important component of a
non-violent world as an ideal which we proclaimed together with
India in the Delhi Declaration and which we invite you to follow.
   After all, it is now quite clear that building up military power
makes no country omnipotent. What is more, one-sided reliance on
military power ultimately weakens other components of national
security.
   It is also quite clear to us that the principle of freedom of
choice is mandatory. Its non-recognition is fraught with extremely
grave consequences for world peace.
   Denying that right to the peoples under whatever pretext or
rhetorical guise means jeopardizing even the fragile balance that
has been attained. Freedom of choice is a universal principle that
should allow for no exceptions.
   It was not simply out of good intentions that we came to the
conclusion that this principle is absolute. We were driven to it by
an unbiased analysis of the objective trends of today.
   More and more characteristic of them is the increasingly
multioptional nature of social development in different countries.
This applies both to the capitalist and to the socialist system. The
diversity of the socio-political structures that have grown over the
past decades out of national liberation movements also attests to
this.
   This objective fact calls for respect for the views and positions
of others, tolerance, a willingness to perceive something different
as not necessarily bad or hostile, and an ability to learn to live
side-by-side with others, while remaining different and not always
agreeing with each other.
   As the world asserts its diversity, attempts to look down on
others and to teach them one's own brand of democracy become totally
improper, to say nothing of the fact that democratic values intended
for export often very quickly lose their worth.
   What we are talking about, therefore, is unity in diversity. If
we assert this politically, if we reaffirm our adherence to freedom
of choice, then there is no room for the view that some live on
Earth by virtue of divine will while others are here quite by chance.
   The time has come to discard such thinking and to shape our
policies accordingly. That would open up prospects for strengthening
the unity of the world.
   The new phase also requires de-ideologizing relations among
states. We are not abandoning our convictions, our philosophy or
traditions, nor do we urge anyone to abandon theirs.
   But neither do we have any intention to be hemmed in by our
values. That would result in intellectual impoverishment, for it
would mean rejecting a powerful source of development _ the exchange
of everything original that each nation has independently created.
   In the course of such exchange, let everyone show the advantages
of their social system, way of life or values _ and not just by
words or propaganda, but by real deeds.
   That would be a fair rivalry of ideologies. But it should not be
extended to relations among states. Otherwise, we would simply be
unable to solve any of the world's problems, such as:
   _developing wide-ranging mutually beneficial and equitable
cooperation among nations;
   _making efficient use of the achievements of' scientific and
technological revolution;
   _restructuring the world economy and protecting the environment;
   _overcoming backwardness, eliminating hunger, disease, illiteracy
and other global scourges.
   Nor, of course, shall we then be able to eliminate the nuclear
threat and militarism.
   Those are our reflections on the patterns of world development at
the threshold of the 21st century.
   We are, of course, far from claiming to be in possession of the
ultimate truth. But, on the basis of a thorough analysis of the past
and newly emerging realities, we have concluded that it is on those
lines that we should jointly seek the way leading to the supremacy
of the universal human idea over the endless multitude of
centrifugal forces, the way to preserve the vitality of this
civilization, possibly the only one in the entire universe.
   Could this view be a little too romantic? Are we not
overestimating the potential and the maturity of the world's social
consciousness? We have heard such doubts and such questions both in
our country and from some of our Western partners.
   I am convinced that we are not floating above reality.
   Forces have already emerged in the world that in one way or
another stimulate the arrival of a period of peace. The peoples and
large sectors of the public do, indeed, ardently wish for an
improvement in the situation. They want to learn to cooperate.
   It is sometimes even amazing how powerful this trend is. It is
also important that it is beginning to shape policies.
   Changes in philosophical approaches and in political relations
form a solid prerequisite for imparting, in line with worldwide
objective processes, a powerful impetus to the efforts designed to
establish new relations among states.
   Even those politicians whose activities used to be geared to the
Cold War and sometimes linked with its most-critical phases are now
drawing appropriate conclusions. Of all people, they find it
particularly hard to abandon old stereotypes and past practices.
   And if even they are changing course, it is clear that when new
generatihe understanding of the need for a period of peace is
gaining ground and beginning to prevail. This has made it possible
to take the first real steps in creating a healthier international
environment and in disarmament.
   What are the practical implications of that? It would be natural
and sensible not to abandon everything positive that has already
been accomplished and to build on all the gains of the past few
years, on all that we have created working together.
   I am referring to the process of negotiations on nuclear arms,
conventional weapons and chemical weapons, and to the search for
political approaches to ending regional conflicts.
   Of course, I am referring above all to political dialogue _ a
more intense and open dialogue pointed at the very heart of problems
instead of confrontation, at an exchange of constructive ideas
instead of recriminations. Without political dialogue, the process
of negotiations cannot advance.
   We regard prospects for the near and more distant future quite
optimistically.
   Just look at the changes in our relations with the United States.
Little by little, mutual understanding has started to develop and
elements of trust have emerged, without which it is very hard to
make headway in politics.
   In Europe, these elements are even more numerous. The Helsinki
process is a great process. I believe that it remains fully valid.
Its philosophical, political, practical and other dimensions must
all be preserved and enhanced, while taking into account new
circumstance.

<HEAD>Pentagon Probing Complaint of Navy's Pro-IBM Bias</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department's inspector general has
begun reviewing allegations the Navy is routinely and unfairly
funneling its major computer contracts to the International Business
Machines Corp.
   The allegations were advanced last month in a letter to Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci signed by six of IBM's leading
competitors. The six assert the Navy is wasting hundreds of millions
of dollars by using biased procurement practices that favor IBM.
   Jim Turner, a Pentagon spokesman, said the allegations in the
Nov. 17 letter were referred to the inspector general's office late
laspector general is an independent
auditor-investigator with the authority to probe any aspect of
defense procurement.
   Turner said neither Carlucci nor the Pentagon would have any
further comment on the matter pending t month. The insthe inspector general's
review. The Navy likewise declined immediate comment.
   The five-page letter sent to Carlucci was signed by executives of
the Amdahl Corp.; Memorex Telex Corp.; PacifiCorp Capital Inc.; VION
Corp.; NCR Compten, and Storage Technology Corp.
   The companies, which sell equipment that is compatible with IBM's
System 370 architecture, contended that Navy purchasing agents
routinely ``wire'' contracts by drawing up specifications that are
based olies.
But that gene has been shown not to be a factor in other families,
supporting the longstanding suspicion of multiple factors, perhaps
environmental and genetic.
   The voices and hallucinations are gone now for Aldridge, 47,
thanks to daily medication that keeps his illness at bay. ``I'm
enjoying relatively good health now,'' he said, but ``nothing is
guaranteed me'' for the future.
   For the Louisiana native, the schizophrenia battle began after
his athletic career. He played defensive end for the Packers and was
part of the most famous defensive line in National Football League
history when the team won three straight NFL championships and the
first two Super Bowls.
   He was traded to the San Diego Chargers in 1971 and retired from
pro ball after two seasons, taking up radio and TV sportscasting in
Milwaukee. NBC used him as an analyst for several seasons, including
its 1977 Super Bowl coverage.
   But the first signs of trouble had already appeared in early
1974. He had trouble concentrating. He couldn't get his work done on
time, and as a result his broadcasts often ran shorter than planned.
   ``I became very suspicious of people, especially the people I
worked with. The workplace became very difficult, a very unhappy
place.''
   Aldridge sought psychotherapy. But later that year, he began to
have bouts of psychosis, with imaginary voices and hallucinations.
   ``It was like suddenly discovering another world ... one that had
been here all along, one that was totally foreign and frightening.''
   While his behavior on the air appeared normal, his life at other
times was bizarre. He feared that his wife was a witch. He ran
barefoot through the snow in search of his therapist.
   Soon, he was hospitalized. ``I knew I needed help,'' he said. But
the medication he received for a couple years ``zombied me out so
bad I couldn't work.'' He had to work, so he gave up the medication.
   He continued to fight the voices that told him to quit his job
and leave town, and that nobody liked him. He battled the delusions
that the station was underground, that he had to hide from others
and watch out for himself.
   ``That was the existence I chose because I wouldn't take the
medication, because I figured I could take care of myself.''
   In 1981 he took a leave of absence from his job. ``I simply could
not do it any more,'' he said. His wife had already filed for
divorce.
   He left Milwaukee and traveled the country for as long as his
money held out, then he sold the car and continued by bus and train.
Within a few months of leaving town, he was living on the streets.
   But he found some respectable jobs: sports director at a
Louisiana radio station, prison counselor, football coach at a high
school and a college.
   ``I could keep myself straight during the interview,'' he
recalled, and when the employers found out who he was, they were
happy to hire him.
   But ``the voices ... wouldn't let me stay anyplace for any length
of time,'' he said. One by one, he left his jobs or was let go.
   In 1984 he found himself back in a Milwaukee hospital, thanks to
friends alarmed by his behavior. The doctors talked about medicine
again, and Aldridge figured he would give it a try. ``I had nothing
to stay straight for on the outside,'' so being ``zombied out''
would not be a problem, he reasoned.
   So it went for about three months. But then his doctor cut the
dose until Aldridge was taking just enough medication to keep the
voices and hallucinations away while avoiding the side effect.
   In late 1984 he left the hospital for a nursing home, then went
on to his own apartment. He started work at the post office in 1985,
and apart from a brief interruption, he has been there since. Now
Aldridge speaks publicly about schizophrenia, hoping to encourage
research. He was recently honored for his efforts by the National
Mental Health Association.
   Looking back at what schizophrenia cost him, he said, ``I'm
trying to find out what good it brought.
   ``It brought me the ability to travel around the country and talk
to people about it. It made me stronger in some ways ...
   ``It made me comfortable in situations where I was uncomfortable
before. I can't think of any situation where I can be intimidated,
because the worst has already happened. How much more can you lose
than everything?''

   A resident of a battered-women's shelter shot and
killed a woman and wounded four other people this morning, then
barricaded herself briefly in her room with two children before
giving up, police said.
   The assailant had threatened to kill the children and a officer
if he entered the room, said police spokeswoman Ann Montoya.
   The motive for the shootings at the Brandon Center was not
immediately known, nor was the relationship between the woman and
the children.
   The woman, known to police only as Juanita, was thought to have a
.45-caliber semiautomatic pistol, Montoya said. Police began
negotiating with her about 9:30 a.m., a half-hour after the
shootings, said police spokesman John Wyckoff.
   A woman died at St. Anthony Hospital of a gunshot wound, Montoya
said. Two other victims were in serious condition at Denver General
Hospital, and two others were being treated there, said Montoya.
Their condition was not known.
   Police evacuated the three-story brick building of the 70 to 75
women and children living there and closed in on the woman's
basement apartment, negotiating from an apartment two doors away,
Wyckoff said.

   On Tuesday, police arrested four Moroccans and seized about 500
pounds of hashish in two separate operations in the southern

   Western pop music has been banned from the
official English-language radio broadcast during government working
hours, an official said.
   Instead, listeners of state-run Radio Sultanate of Oman on
Wednesday heard classical music played from 7:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
   ``It was not deemed suitable for disco music to be piped through
civil servants' offices,'' said the official. ``But Beethoven and
Mozart is OK.''
   Sultan Qaboos, the 48-year-old British-educated leader of this

   The change did not affect the Arabic-language broadcast, which
plays predominantly Egyptian pop music.
   The English-language program is aimed at the mostly British or
Asian foreign work force that represents an estimated 20 percent of
Oman's 1.5 million people.

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: new circumstance.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Current realities make it imperative that the dialogue that
ensures normal and constructive evolution of international affairs
involve, on a continuous and active basis, all countries and regions
of the world, including such major powers as India, China, Japan,
and Brazil and other countries _ big, medium and small.
   I am in favor of a more dynamic and substantive political
dialogue, of strengthening the political prequisites needed to
improve the inteions to many problems. Tough as it may be, this is
the road that we must travel.
   Everyone should join in the movement toward greater unity of the
world.
   Today, this is particularly important, for we are approaching a
very important point when we shall have to face the question of how
to assure the world's solidarity and the stability and dynamism of
international relations.
   And yet, in my taIks with foreign government and political
leaders, with whom I have had over 200 meetings, I could sometimes
sense their dissatisfaction over the fact that at this crucial time,
for one reason or another, they sometimes find themselves, as it
were, on the sidelines of the main issues of world politics.
   It is natural and appropriate that no one is willing to resign
oneself to that.
   If, although different, we are indeed part of the same
civilization, if we are aware of the interdependence of the
contemporary world, then this fact must be increasingly present in
politics and in the practical efforts to harmonize international
relations. Perhaps, the term perestroika would not be quite
appropriate in this context, but I do call for building new
international relations.
   I am convinced that our time and the realities of today's world
call for internationalizing dialogue and the negotiating process.
   This is the main, the most general conclusion that we have come
to in studying global trends that have been gaining momentum in
recent years, and in participating in world politics.
   In this specific historical situation we face the question of a
new role for the United Nations.
   We feel that states must to some extent review their attitude to
the United Nations, this unique instrument without which world
politics would be inconceivable today.
   The recent reinvigoration of its peacemaking role has again
demonstrated the United Nations' ability to assist its members in
coping with the daunting challenges of our time and working to
humanize their relations.
   Regrettably, shortly after it was established, the organization
went through the onslaught of the Cold War. For many years, it was
the scene of propaganda battles and continuous political
confrontation.
   Let historians argue who is more and who is less to blame for it.
What political leaders today need to do is to draw lessons from that
chapter in the history of the United Nations which turned out to be
at odds with the very meaning and objectives of our organization.
   One of the most bitter and important lessoms lies in the long
list of missed opportunities. As a result, at a certain point the
authority of the United Nations diminished and many of its attempts
to act failed.
   It is highly significant that the reinvigoration of the role of
the United Nations is linked to an improvement in the international
climate.
   In a way, the United Nations blends together the interests of
different states. It is the only organization capable of merging
into a single current their bilateral, regional and global efforts.
   New prospects are opening up for it in all areas that fall
naturally under its responsibility _ in the politico-military,
economic, scientific, technological, environmental, and humanitarian
areas.
   Take, for example, the problem of development, which is a truly
universal human problem. Conditions in which tens of millions of
people live in a number of Third World regions are becoming a real
threat to all mankind.
   No closed entities or even regional communities of states,
important as they are, are capable of untangling the main knots that
tie up the principal avenues of world economic relations _
North-South, East-West, South-South, South-East, and East-East.
   What is needed here is joining the efforts and taking into
account the interests of all groups of countries, something that
only this organization, the United Nations, can accomplish.
   External debt is one of the gravest problems.
   Let us not forget that in the age of colonialism the developing
world, at the cost of countless losses and sacrifices, financed the
prosperity of a large portion of the world community. The time has
come to make up for the losses that accompanied its historic and
tragic contribution to global material progress.
   We are convinced that here, too, internationalizing our approach
shows a way out.
   Looking at things realistically, one has to admit that the
accumulated debt cannot be repaid or recovered on the original terms.
   The Soviet Union is prepared to institute a lengthy moratorium of
up to 100 years on debt servicing by the least developed countries,
and in quite a few cases to write off the debt altogether.
   As regards other developing countries, we invite you to consider
the following:
   _limiting their official debt servicing payments depending on the
economic performance of each of them or granting them a long pariod
of deferral in the repayment of a major portion of their debt;
   _supporting the appeal of the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development for reducing debts owed to commercial banks;
   _guaranteeing government support for market arrangements to
assist in Third World debt settlement, including the formation of a
specialized international agency that would repurchase debts at a
discount.
   The Soviet Union favours a substantive discussion of ways to
settle the debt crisis at multilateral forums, including
consultations under the auspices of the United Nations among heads
of government of debtor and creditor countries.
   International economic security is inconceivable unless related
not only to disarmament but also to the elimination of the threat to
the world's environment. In a number of regions, the state of the
environment is simply frightening.
   A conference on the environment within the framework of the
United Nations is scheduled for 1992. We welcome this decision and
are working to have this forum produce results that would be
commensurate with the scope of the problem.
   But time is running out. Much is being done in various countries.
Here again I would just like to underscore most emphatically the
prospects opening up in the process of disarmament _ particularly,
of course, nuclear disarmament _ for environmental revival.

   Iran's Parliament on Wednesday approved
more than $500 million for rebuilding housing, businesses and

radio reported.
   About $150 million of the sum will be used for educational,
medical and agricultural projects, according to the report,
monitored in Nicosia.
   Western analysts estimate Iran will need up to $400 billion in
the next decade to reconstruct its war-torn economy.
   West Germany signed an agreement in Tehran on Tuesday to finance

materials in Iran.
   Iranian Minister of Housing and Urban Development Serajeddin
Kazerooni said similar agreements are being negotiated with the

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: environmental revival.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Let us also think about setting up within the framework of the
United Nations a center for emergency environmental assistance. Its
function would be promptly to send international groups of experts
to areas with badly deteriorating environment.
   The Soviet Union is also ready to cooperate in establishing an
international space laboratory or manned orbital station designed
exclusively for monitoring the state of the environment.
   In the general area of space exploration, the outlines of a
future space industry are becoming increasingly clear.
   The position of the Soviet Union is well known: activities in
outer space must rule out the appearance of weapons there. Here
again, there has to be a legal base. The groundwork for it _ the
provisions of the 1967 treaty and other agreements _ is already in
place.
   However, there is already a strongly felt need to develop an
all-embracing regime for peaceful work in outer space. The
verification of compliance with that regime would be entrusted to a
World Space Organization.
   We have put forward our proposal to establish it on more than one
occasion. We are prepared to incorporate within its system our
Krasnoyarsk radar station. A decision has already been taken to
place that radar under the authority of the U.S.S.R. Academy of
Sciences.
   Soviet scientists are prepared to receive their foreign
colleagues and discuss with them ways of converting it into an
international center for peaceful cooperation by dismantling and
refitting certain units and structures, and to provide additional
equipment.
   The entire system could function under the auspices of the United
Nations.
   The whole world welcomes the efforts of this organization and its
secretary-general, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, and his representatives in
untying knots of regional problems.
   Allow me to elaborate on this.
   Paraphrasing the words of the English poet that Hemingway took as
an epigraph to his famous novel, I will say this: The bell of every
regional conflict tolls for all of us.
   This is particularly true, since those conflicts are taking place
in the Third World, which already faces many ills and problems of
such magnitude that is has to be a matter of concern to us all.
   The year 1988 has brought a glimmer of hope in this area of our
common concerns as well. This has been felt in almost all regional
crises. On some of them, there has been movement. We welcome it and
we did what we could to contribute to it.
   I will single out only Afghanistan.
   The Geneva accords, whose fundamental and practical significance
has been praised throughout the world, provided a possibility for
completing the process of settlement even before the end of this
year. That did not happen.
   This unfortunate fact reminds us again of the political, legal
and moral significance of the Roman maxim: Pacta sunt servanda _
Treaties must be observed.
   I don't want to use this rostrum for recriminations against
anyone.
   But it is our view that, within the competence of the United
Nations, the General Assembly Resolution adopted last November could
be supplemented by some specific measures.
   In the words of that resolution, for the urgent achievement of a
comprehensive solution by the Afghans themselves of the question of
a broad-based government the following should be undertaken:
   _a complete cease-fire effective everywhere as of Jan. 1, l989,
and the cessation of all offensive operations or shellings, with the
opposing Afghan groups retaining, for the duration of negotiations,
all territories under their control;
   _linked to that, stopping as of the same date any supplies of
arms to all belligerents;
   _for the period of establishing a broad-based government, as
provided in the General Assembly resolution, sending to Kabul and
other strategic centres of the country a contingent of United
Nations peace-keeping forces;
   _we also request the secretary-general to facilitate early
implementation of the idea of holding an international conference on
the neutrality and demilitarization of Afghanistan.
   We shall continue most actively to assist in healing the wounds
of the war and are prepared to cooperate in this endeavor both with
the United Nations and on a bilateral basis.
   We support the proposal to create under the auspices of the
United Nations a voluntary international Peace Corps to assist in
the revival of Afghanistan.
   In the context of the problem of settling regional conflicts, I
have to express my opinion on the serious incident that has recently
affected the work of this session. The chairman of an organization
which has observer status at the United Nations was not allowed by
U.S. authorities to come to New York to address the General
Assembly. I am referring to Yasser Arafat.
   What is more, this happened at a time when the Palestine
Liberation Organization has made a constructive step which
facilitates the search for a solution to the Middle East problem
with the involvement of the United Nations Security Council.
   This happened at a time when a positive trend has become apparent
toward a political settlement of other regional conflicts, in many
cases with the assistance of the U.S.S.R. and the United States. We
voice our deep regret over the incident and our solidarity with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Ladies and Gentlemen,
   The concept of comprehensive international security is based on
the principles of the United Nations Charter and is predicated on
the binding nature of international law for all states.
   Being in favor of demilitarizing international relations, we want
political and legal methods to prevail in solving whatever problems
may arise.
   Our ideal is a world community of states, which are based on the
rule of law and which subordinate their foreign policy activities to
law.
   The achievement of this goal would be facilitated by an agreement
within the United Nations on a uniform understanding of the
principles and norms of international law, their codification with
due regard to new conditions, and the development of legal norms for
new areas of cooperation.
   In a nuclear age, the effectiveness of international law should
be based not on enforcing compliance but rather on norms reflecting
a balance of state interests.
   In addition to the ever increasing awareness of the objective
commonality of our destiny, this would make every state genuinely
interested in exercising self-restraint within the bounds of
international law.
   Democratizing international relations means not only a maximum
degree of internationalization in the efforts of all members of the
world community to solve problems. It also means humanizing those
relations.
   International ties will fully reflect the genuine interests of
the peoples and effectively serve the cause of their common security
only when the human being and his concerns, rights and freedoms
become the center of all things.

<HEAD>Comunist Party Leader Replaced in Tibet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party chief in Tibet, known for his
support of relatively liberal policies in that region, has been
removed from his post, an official spokesman said Wednesday.
   Wu Jinghua, appointed to the job in May 1985, was replaced by Hu
Jintao, head of the party committee in Guizhou province since July
1985.
   A Western traveler and a Tibetan switchboard operator, meanwhile,
said the situation in Lhasa, Tibet's provincial capital, was calm.
Two clashes in as many years between pro-independence Tibetans and
Chinese forces killed dozens of people.
   In Beijing, Zhang Wenyuan, spokesman for the Liaison Office of
the Chinese Communist Party, said Wu's removal was part of a
``normal job rotation'' and denied the switch was related to unrest
in Tibet.
   Zhang said the transfer had been made ``recently'' although he
declined to specify when. He said he did not know what job, if any,
Wu was to hold following his dismissal.
   A Chinese source, contacted Wednesday night in Beijing, said the
move was made Dec. 1. The source described the new party leader, Hu,
as a ``conservative,'' meaning that he would likely adopt a harder
approach than Wu toward Tibetan pro-independence activities.
   Rumors have circulated since summer that Wu was set to be sacked
because he had not cracked down hard enough on the pro-independence
protests.
   Anti-Chinese demonstrations began in Lhasa in late September and
October 1987, resulting in the deaths of at least 14 people.
   On March 5, pro-independence Tibetans clashed again with police
and Western travelers quoted Tibetans as saying at least 24 people
died. Chinese reports said hundreds were arrested in October and
March.
   Since March, sketchy reports from Lhasa have described the city
as tense although little violence has been reported.
   On Wednesday, the Western traveler contacted by telephone said he
had not seen many soldiers on the street. He said the mood in the
city was ``mellow.''
   The telephone operator also reported the city was calm.
   While head of the party in Tibet, Wu has been credited with
enacting relatively liberal policies, said one source close to the
dismissed leader.
   During the Cultural Revolution, which lasted from 1966 to 1976,
bands of ultra-radical Red Guards destroyed Tibet's Buddhist temples
and killed thousands of monks in an attempt to wipe out Tibet's
culture, vilified as ``feudal'' and ``backward.''
   The use of the Tibetan language was banned in schools and
Tibetans were forbidden from traveling within the region unless they
first obtained a permit.
   With the end of the Cultural Revolution, China's policies in
Tibet moderated somewhat.
   Under Wu, Tibetans were allowed to use their native tongue in
schools and were given limited freedom to travel within the huge
region, which borders India, Nepal, Bhutan and Burma.
   Wu, the source said, was also responsible for encouraging the
central government to develop Tibet's economy and opening Lhasa's
first university.
   China claims sovereignty over Tibet dating to the 13th century.
   Chinese troops entered Tibet in 1950. Nine years later the
crushed an anti-Chinese uprising and Tibet's religious and spiritual
leader, the Dalai Lama, fled to exile in India.
   After decades of accusing the Chinese of genocide, the Dalai Lama
recently adopted a more conciliatory tone. In a speech in
Strasbourg, France, in June, he said he would accept a Chinese troop
presence in Tibet and Chinese management of Tibet's foreign
relations if China let Tibet run its internal affairs.
   China in September proposed to meet with the Dalai Lama but
stressed that the Strasbourg proposals could not be used as a basis
for the talks.
   The Dalai Lama has proposed that the two sides meet in Geneva in
January. China has yet to respond.

   In this context I would like to join the voice of my country in
the expressions of high appreciation of the significance of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted 40 years ago on Dec.
10, 1948.
   Today, this document retains its significance. It, too, reflects
the universal nature of the goals and objectives of the United
Nations.
   The most fitting way for a state to observe this anniversary of
the declaration is to improve its domestic conditions for respectlng
and protecting the rights of its own citizens.
   Before I inform you on what specifically we have undertaken
recently in this respect I would like to say the following.
   Our country is going through a period of truly revolutionary
uplifting.
   The process of perestroika is gaining momentum. We began with the
formulation of the theoretical concept of perestroika. We had to
evaluate the nature and the magnitude of problems, to understand the
lessons of the past and express that in the form of political
conclusions and programmes. This was done.
   Theoretical work, a reassessment of what is happening, the
finalization, enrichment and readjustment of political positions
have not been completed. They are continuing.
   But it was essential to begin with an overall concept, which, as
now confirmed by the experience of these past years, has generally
proved to be correct and which has no alternative.
   For our society to participate in efforts to implement the plans
of perestroika, it had to be democratized in practice. Under the
sign of democratization, perestroika has now spread to politics, the
economy, intellectual life and ideology.
   We have initiated a radical economic reform. We have gained
experience. At the start of next year the entire national economy
will be redirected to new forms and methods of operation. This also
means profoundly reorganizing relations of production and releasing
the tremendous potential inherent in socialist property.
   Undertaking such bold revolutionary transformations, we realized
that there would be mistakes, and also opposition, that new
approaches would generate new problems. We also foresaw the
possibility of slowdowns in some areas.
   But the guarantee that the overall process of perestroika will
steadily move forward and gain strength lies in a profound
democratic reform of the entire system of power and administration.
   With the recent decisions by the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet on
amendments to the Constitution and the adoption of the Law on
Elections, we have completed the first stage of the process of
political reform.
   Without pausing, we have begun the second stage of this process
with the main task of improving the relationship between the center
and the republics, harmonizing interethnic relations on the
principles of Leninist internationalism that we inherited from the
Great Revolution, and at the same time reorganizing the local system
of Soviet power.
   A great deal of work lies ahead. Major tasks will have to be
dealt with concurrently.
   We are full of confidence. We have a theory and a policy, and
also the vanguard force of perestroika _ the party, which also is
restructuring itself in accordance with new tasks and fundamental
changes in society as a whole.
   What is most important is that all our peoples and all
generations of citizens of our great country support perestroika.
   We have become deeply involved in building a socialist state
based on the rule of law. Work on a series of new laws has been
completed or is nearing completion.
   Many of them will enter into force as early as in 1989, and we
expect them to meet the highest standards from the standpoint of
ensuring the rights of the individual.
   Soviet democracy will be placed on a solid normative base. I am
referring, in particular, to laws on the freedom of conscience,
glasnost, public associations and organizations, and many others.
   In places of confinement there are no persons convicted for their
political or religious beliefs.
   Additional guarantees are to be included in the new draft laws
that rule out any form of persecution on those grounds.
   Naturally this does not apply to those who committed actual
criminal offenses or state crimes such as espionage, sabotage,
terrorism, etc., whatever their political or ideological beliefs.
   Draft amendments to the penal code have been prepared and are
awaiting their turn. Among the articles being revised are those
related to capital punishment.
   The problem of exit from and entry to our country, including the
question of leaving it for family reunification, is being dealt with
in a humane spirit.
   As you know, one of the reasons for refusal to leave is a
person's knowledge of secrets. Strictly warranted time limitations
on the secrecy rule will now be applied. Every person seeking
employment at certain agencies or enterprises will be informed of
this rule. In case of disputes, there is a right of appeal under the
law.
   This removes from the agenda the problem of the so-called
``refuseniks''.
   We intend to expand the Soviet Union's participation in the
United Nations and CSCE (Conference of Security and Cooperation in
Europe) human rights monitoring arrangements. We believe that the
jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice at the Hague as
regards the interpretation and implementation of agreements on human
rights should be binding on all states.
   We regard as part of the Helsinki process the cessation of
jamming of all foreign radio broadcasts beamed at the Soviet Union.
   Overall, this is our credo. Political problems must be solved
only by political means; human problems, only in a humane way.
   Now let me turn to the main issue _ disarmament, without which
none of the problems of the coming century can be solved.
   International development and communication have been distorted
by the arms race and the militarization of thinking.
   As you know, on Jan. 15, 1986 the Soviet Union put forward a
program of building a nuclear weapon-free world. Translated into
actual negotiating positions, it has already produced material
results.
   Tomorrow marks the first anniversary of the signing of the INF
Treaty. I am therefore particularly pleased to note that the
implementation of the treaty _ the elimination of missiles _ is
proceeding normally, in an atmosphere of trust and business-like
work.
   A large breach has thus been made in a seemingiy unbreakable wall
of suspicion and animosity. We are witnessing the emergence of a new
historic reality _ a turning away from the principle of super
armament to the principle of reasonable defense sufficiency.
   We are present at the birth of a new model of ensuring security _
not through the build-up of arms, as was almost always the case in
the past, but on the contrary, through their reduction on the basis
of compromise.
   The Soviet leadership has decided to demonstrate once again its
readiness to reinforce this healthy process not only by words but
also by deeds.
   Today, I can report to you that the Soviet Union has taken a
decision to reduce its armed forces.
   Within the next two years their numerical strength will be
reduced by 500,000 men. The numbers of conventional armaments will
also be substantially reduced. This will be done unilaterally,
without relation to the talks on the mandate of the Vienna meeting.
   By agreement with our Warsaw Treaty allies, we have decided to
withdraw by 1991 six tank divisions from the GDR, Czechoslovakia and
Hungary, and to disband them.

<TEXT>
   Assault landing troops and several other formations and units,
including assault crossing units with their weapons and combat
equipment, will also be withdrawn from the groups of Soviet forces
stationed in those countries.
   Soviet forces stationed in those countries will be reduced by
50,000 men and their armaments, by 5,000 tanks.
   All Soviet divisions remaining, for the time being, in the
territory of our allies are being reorganized. Their structure will
be different from what it is now; after a major cutback of their
tanks it will become clearly defensive.
   At the same time, we shall reduce the numerical strength of the
armed forces and the numbers of armaments stationed in the European
part of the U.S.S.R.
   In total, Soviet armed forces in this part of our country and in
the territories of our European allies will be reduced by 10,000
tanks, 8,500 artillery systems and 800 combat aircraft.
   Over these two years we intend to reduce significantly our armed
forces in the Asian part of our country, too. By agreement with the
government of the Mongolian People's Republic a major portion of
Soviet troops temporarily stationed there will return home.
   In taking this fundamental decision the Soviet leadership
expresses the will of the people, who have undertaken a profound
renewal of their entire socialist society.
   We shall maintain our country's defense capability at a level of
reasonable and reliable sufficiency so that no one might be tempted
to encroach on the security of the U.S.S.R. and our allies.
   By this action, and by all our activities in favor of
demilitarizing international relations, we wish to draw the
attention of the international community to yet another pressing
problem _ the problem of transition from the economy of armaments to
an economy of disarmament.
   Is conversion of military production a realistic idea? I have
already had occasion to speak about this. We think that, indeed, it
is realistic.
   For its part, the Soviet Union is prepared:
   _in the framework of our economic reform we are ready to draw up
and make public our internal plan of conversion;
   _in the course of 1989 to draw up, as an experiment, conversion
plans for two or three defense plants;
   _to make public our experience in providing employment for
specialists from military industry and in using its equipment,
buildings and structures in civilian production.
   It is desirable that all states, in the first place major
military powers, should submit to the United Nations their national
conversion plans.
   It would also be useful to set up a group of scientists to
undertake a thorough analysis of the problem of conversion as a
whole and as applied to individual countries and regions and report
to the secretary-general of the United Nations, and, subsequently,
to have this matter considered at a session of the General Assembly.
   And finally, since I am here on American soil, and also for other
obvious reasons, I have to turn to the subject of our relations with
this great country. I had a chance to appreciate the full measure of
its hospitality during my memorable visit to Washington exactly a
year ago.
   The relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of
America have a history of 5{ decades. As the world changed, so did
the nature, role and place of those relations in world politics.
   For too long a time they developed along the lines of
confrontation and sometimes animosity _ either overt or covert.
   But in the last few years the entire world could breath a sigh of
relief thanks to the changes for the better in the substance and the
atmosphere of the relationship between Moscow and Washington.
   No one intends to underestimate the seriousness of our
differenees and the toughness of outstanding problems. We have,
however, already graduated from the primary school of learning to
understand each other and seek solutions in both our own and common
interests.
   The U.S.S.R. and the United States have built the largest nuclear
and missile arsenals. But it is those two countries that, having
become specifically aware of their responsibility, were the first to
conclude a treaty on the reduction and physical elimination of a
portion of their armaments which posed a threat to both of them and
to all others.
   Both countries possess the greatest and the most sophisticated
military secrets. But it is those two countries that have laid a
basis for and are further developing a system of mutual verification
both of the elimination of armaments and of the reduction and
prohibition of their production.
   It is those two countries that are accumulating the experience
for future bilateral and multilateral agreements.
   We value this. We acknowledge and appreciate the contribution
made by President Ronald Reagan and by the members of his
administration, particularly Mr. George Shultz.
   All this is our joint investment in a venture of historic
importance. We must not lose this investment, or leave it idle.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's United Nations
speech Wednesday was carried live on Soviet radio and TV, with an
announcer saying delegates gave him an ovation that was unlike any
other in memory.
   ``The professional quality of those sitting at the delegation
tables dictates restraining a display of feeling, the stormy
expression of which is just not acceptable here,'' a TV announcer
said after Gorbachev's speech, the first at the world body by a
Soviet leader since Nikita S. Khrushchev in 1960.
   ``But such a reaction which you the television viewers witnessed
is difficult to recall,'' the announcer said, in explaining the
delegates' response.

   The next U.S. administration headed by President-elect George
Bush will find in us a partner who is ready _ without long pauses or
backtracking _ to continue the dialogue in a spirit of realism,
openness and goodwill, with a willingness to achieve concrete
results working on the agenda which covers the main issues of
Soviet-U.S. relations and world politics.
   I have in mind, above all, consistent movement toward a treaty on
50 percent reductions in strategic offensive arms while preserving
the ABM treaty;
   _working out a convention on the elimination of chemical weapons
_ here, as we see it, prerequisites exist to make 1989 a decisive
year;
   _and negotiations on the reduction of conventional arms and armed
forces in Europe.
   I also have in mind economic, environmental and humanistic
problems in their broadest sense.
   It would be quite wrong to put the positive changes in the
international situation exclusively to the credit of the U.S.S.R.
and the United States.
   The Soviet Union highly appreciates the major and original
contribution of socialist countries in the process of creating a
healthier international environment.
   During the course of negotiations we are constantly aware of the
presence of other major powers, both nuclear and non-nuclear.
   Many countries, including medium-sized and small ones, and, of
course, the Non-Aligned Movement and the intercontinental Group of
Six are playing a uniquely important constructive role.
   We in Moscow are happy that an ever increasing number of
statesmen, political party and public figures and _ I want to
emphasize this _ scientists, cultural figures, representatives of
mass movements and various churches, and activists of the so-called
people's diplomacy, are ready to shoulder the burden of universal
responsibility.
   In this regard, I believe that the idea of convening on a regular
basis, under the auspices of the United Nations, an assembly of
public organizations deserves attention.
   We are not inclined to simplify the situation in the world.
   Yes, the trend touard disarmament has been given a powerful
impetus, and the process is gaining a momentum of its own. But it
has not yet become irreversible.
   Yes, the willingness to give up confrontation in favor of
dialogue and cooperation is felt strongly. But it is still far from
becoming a permanent feature in the practice of international
relations.
   Yes, movement toward a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world
is capable of radically transforming the political and intellectual
identity of our planet. But only the first steps have been made, and
even they have been met with mistrust in certain influential
quarters and face resistance.
   The legacy and the inertia of the past continue to be felt.
Profound contradictions and the roots of many conflicts have not
disappeared. And there remains another fundamental fact which is
that a peaceful period will be taking shape in the context of the
existence and rivalry of different socio-economic and political
systems.
   However, the thrust of our international efforts and one of the
key elements of the new thinking is that this rivalry should be
given a quality of reasonable competition with due regard for
freedom of choice and a balance of interests.
   Then it will even become useful and productive from the
standpoint of global development.
   Otherwise _ if the arms race, as before, remains its basic
component _ this rivalry will be deadly.
   More and more people throughout the world _ leaders a well as
ordinary people _ are beginning to understand.
   Esteemed Mr. President, distinguished delegates,
   I am concluding my first address to the United Nations with the
same feeling that I had when I began it _ a feeling of
responsibllity to my own people and to the world community.
   We are meeting at the end of a year which has meant so much for
the United Nations and on the eve of a year from which we all expect
so much.
   I would like to believe that our hopes will be matched by our
joint effort to put an end to an era of wars, confrontation and
regional conflicts, to aggressions against nature, to the terror of
hunger and poverty as well as to political terrorism.
   This is our common goal and we can only reach it together.
   Thank you.

<HEAD>29 Airlines Fined for Security Lapses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-nine airlines have been fined a total of
$1.6 million for security lapses at airport passenger checkpoints,
the Federal Aviation Administration announced today.
   The fines ranged from $1,000 each against a handful of commuter
carriers to more than $200,000 apiece against three large carriers _
American Airlines, Northwest Airlines and United Airlines _ each of
which had more than two dozen violations.
   The lapses included lapses by security guards in detecting mock
weapons during tests conducted by undercover FAA officials.
   A total of 236 mock weapons went undetected at the various
checkpoints, most of them in a six-month period from April to
September, the FAA said. The agency declined to give a breakdown on
the detection rates at specific airports.
   Despite the latest civil penalties, Transportation Department
officials said the airlines, which are responsible for passenger
screening at airports, have significantly improved their detection
of weapons at screening points since the matter became a focus of
heightened concern in late l987.
   According to FAA figures, the airlines during the July-September
period increased their detection rate to 88.9 percent, compared to
78.9 percent in all of l987.
   But Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said the FAA will
continue to test the airport security network.
   ``Although the detection rate has improved since last year, I
will not be satisfied until we achieve a 100 percent success rate in
detecting weapons,'' Burnley said.

   Donald and Phyllis Ross say they are proud of
their son's accomplishments aboard the space shuttle Atlantis, even
though they have no idea what his mission was.
   ``Like everyone else we don't know what's going on,'' Ross said.
   Atlantis finished its secret mission and landed Tuesday night at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry Ross, 40, was mission specialist for the
flight and helped fly the spacecraft during ascent and re-entry. He
also was on the Atlantis' mission in November 1985, when he walked
in space.
   His parents watched Atlantis' return on a large-screen television
at the Johnson Space Center in Texas, and talked with him a few
hours later.
   ``He said it was a wonderful flight, a real thrilling experience.
I wish he could've told us more about it, but he can't,'' said Mrs.
Ross, 61.
   After the mission, the astronauts met with NASA officials and
relatives, then left for Houston.
   Ross' wife, Karen, and their children, Amy, 17, and Scott, 16,
met Ross at Edwards Air Force Base. The family lives in Texas.
   Communications with the astronauts were blacked out during the
flight on orders from the Air Force, which paid NASA $70 million to
book space on the orbiter.
   Although the mission was clandestine, sources have said it put a
high-tech military spy satellite in an orbit carrying it over 80
percent of the Soviet Union.

   A man perched on a utility pole in western
Poland for 24 hours displaying a banner that demanded democracy,
then ended his protest peacefully Wednesday, the opposition and the
state media reported.
   According to the Solidarity Information Service, Robert Korcz
climbed the approximately 30-yard-tall pole in Gorzow Wielkopolski
at noon Tuesday and climbed down at noon Wednesday.
   He displayed two banners saying, ``I, Korcz, Demand Democracy in
the PRL'' and ``I, Korcz, Demand Justice in the PRL,'' said
Solidarity spokesman Robert Maziarski. PRL in Polish stands for the
Polish People's Republic.
   Solidarity said the pole was surrounded by police and
sympathizers were barred from giving Korcz food or water.
   The state-run PAP news agency said Korcz, 23, returned home after
the protest.
   According to Maziarski, Korcz said he had been released Nov. 1
after being jailed 1{ years for reporting late for civil militia
duty and for disobeying orders. He said Korcz's protest was to call
attention to alleged mistreatment in prison.
   Gorzow Wielkopolski is about 30 miles east of the East German
border.

   Governors Island, a rocky outcrop with a closeup
view of Manhattan's skyline and the Statue of Liberty, gave a
small-town welcome Wednesday to the leaders of the world's two
mightiest nations who came for lunch.
   School kids got the day off, the golf course was turned into a
helicopter landing pad, and 22,000 trash bags full of fallen leaves
were carted away in preparation for the meeting.
   ``Feelings run a range anywhere from gross inconvenience to
having a place in history,'' said Tom Brodksy, a Coast Guard petty
officer reporting for morning duty.
   The 173-acre speck in the nation's busiest harbor is reachable by
a seven-minute ferry ride from the city, where the glass and
concrete of the World Trade Center and Wall Street tower as citadels
of capitalism.
   Once an Army fortress, Governors Island has been a U.S. Coast
Guard base since 1966 and is home to 3,500 military personnel and
their families. It's open to the public for tours only two days a
year.
   On Wednesday, a sign rimmed by red poinsettias just off the ferry
read: ``Coast Guard Welcomes President Reagan, Chairman Gorbachev
and Vice President Bush.''
   Having the three most powerful men in the world over for lunch
meant disruptions like closing the elementary school, P.S. 26, and
allowing presidential helicopters to land on the nine-hole golf
course, which is used as a military parade field when officers
aren't chipping and putting.
   Eric Fields, 14, shot baskets outside with a chum before all
residents were asked to go inside at 10 a.m. for security purposes.
   ``Gorbachev's coming to say goodbye to Reagan and hello to Bush.
We get the day off, and we might have a better chance at being
friends,'' Fields said.
   Satellite dishes ringed the gymnasium, which was converted into a
giant media center with rows of tables and telephones under
basketball hoops. The Boy Scout sale of Christmas trees was shut
down for the day.
   Coast Guard Lt. Nicholas Dujmovic, said everybody below the rank
of 1st class petty officer helped clean up in preparation for the
visit, including the picking up of dead leaves all over the island.
   Louis Diaz, who runs a delilunch. But he made the most of free
enterprise, fixing sandwiches in the back of his station wagon and
hustling them for $4 to the media from a folding table under a tree.
   ``They were going to make me close. I'd lose money like that,''
said Diaz, tossing ham and cheese onto bagel rolls. ``I got to make
my money.''
   Diaz also said he had ``plenty of Russian dressing.''

   Incense, prayers and pleas for the homeless
were part of a memorial for a scion of a wealthy New England family
who battled addiction and AIDS-related complex before dying homeless
on a Tenderloin District sidewalk.
   Tuesday afternoon's ceremony for Joseph Emerson Eaton, 38, took
place near the spot where he was found dead five hours after he
passed out and was dragged from a fast-food restaurant by a guard
who thought he was drunk.
   ``It was our brother who died and we shall miss him greatly,''
said a homeless man who identified himself as C.Z. and said he knew
Eaton.
   About 100 people, many of them homeless, gathered around two
Eastern Orthodox priests and a makeshift altar with a frayed white
cloth, candles, flowers and religious pictures to remember Eaton and
other homeless people who have died.
   ``Let this be a time again of healing and reconciliation ... the
time for anger is over,'' said the Rev. Thomas Flowers, a monk who
runs a soup kitchen in United Nations Plaza nearby. It was Flowers
who found Eaton's lifeless body just two blocks from City Hall while
making rounds in the seedy Tenderloin.
   The coroner's office said Eaton suffered from alcoholism, drug
abuse and AIDS-related complex and his arms showed fresh needle
marks. They were awaiting toxicology test results before determining
the cause of death.
   ``There's no one to blame,'' Flowers said. ``We're all to blame.''
   Two long sheets of paper taped to a wall outside the Carl's Jr.
restaurant listed others who have died on San Francisco's streets.
   Scattered through the gathering were gaunt people with bedrolls
strapped to their backs, shopping carts loaded with belongings and
plastic bags filled with food. One man wore a lapel button reading,
``Have Faith.'' A group called ``Food Not Bombs'' distributed free
fruit.
   As Carl's Jr. workers looked on, Flowers urged listeners not to
ignore anyone they see lying in doorways or on the streets.
   As a result of Eaton's death, Dr. James Werdegar, head of the
city's Department of Public Health, on Tuesday urged the public to
call authorities when they find someone unconscious on the sidewalk.
Eaton was found dead early Saturday.
   The Tenderloin is known for panhandlers, homeless people sleeping
in doorways and on benches, and a tent city outside the U.S. Health
Department office demanding more federal funding to fight AIDS.
   It's a far cry from the affluent Boston suburb of Duxbury where
Eaton grew up. His late grandfather, Charles Freedom Eaton Jr., was
a financier who founded Investors Bank & Trust Co. His father,
Joseph Emerson Sr., is a retired business executive.
   Eaton attended prestigious New England prep schools. But he was
``an alcoholic from the time he was 13, from the time he took his
first drink,'' said his brother Nick, a New Hampshire contractor.
   ``And later, he got heavily into using drugs,'' Nick Eaton said.
``But time after time after time, it was alcohol that brought him
his troubles.''
   Family members said Eaton tried several treatment programs with
their moral and financial support.
   He never attended college, but worked as a chef or florist. Eaton
moved to San Francisco in 1981, and told his family he was
homosexual.
   ``We accepted his choice of lifestyle,'' said another brother,
Boston television reporter Henry Eaton. ``It was only his
self-destructive drinking that ever concerned us.''
   Eaton became romantically involved with Phillip Coleman, also a
recovering alcoholic-addict. According to Eaton's Alcoholics
Anonymous sponsor, Skip B., they were very happy and Eaton was sober
until Coleman died of AIDS in November 1987.
   By then, Eaton knew he had AIDS-related complex, a condition that
includes some of AIDS' symptoms but not life-threatening cancers or
infections that take advantage of the body's weakened immune system.
   ``Phil's death really devastated Joey,'' said Skip B., who took
Eaton in until he passed out with a cigarette and started a fire at
Skip's. On Nov. 12, Eaton was ordered out, becoming one of San
Francisco's estimated 6,000 homeless.
   Nick Eaton said his brother called Friday to ask the family to
finance another treatment program. They agreed. He died hours later.

<TEXT>
   Melanoma, a sometimes-fatal skin cancer, is
striking more people at a younger age than ever before, and an
expert said the trend could get worse as a result of a thinning of
atmospheric ozone.
   Dr. Darrell S. Rigel, an assistant clinical professor of
dermatology at New York University Medical School, said melanoma is
now diagnosed in one of every 128 Americans, an increase of about
1,500 percent compared with 1935.
   Rigel told the American Academy of Dermatology's annual meeting
on Tuesday that an even more disturbing trend is that the ages of
patients with melanoma is dropping dramatically.
   ``Five years ago it was unusual to see someone under the age of
40 with skin cancer,'' said Rigel. ``Now we're commonly seeing
people in their 20s with skin cancer.''
   About 25 percent of the estimated 27,300 Americans diagnosed as
having melanoma this year will be age 39 or under, he said. Only a
few years ago, it was considered a disease of the aged.
   ``Not only has the overall rate grown, but the age group where it
has grown the most rapidly is in the youngest group,'' said Rigel.
``The rate of increase is highest among the youngest people, not
only here but in other countries.''
   The disease is found largely among light-skinned people and in
this country in the Sun Belt states of the South and West.
   It is generally believed that melanoma, a skin cancer that will
spread throughout the body if not excised early by surgery, develops
after 10 to 20 years of heavy or damaging exposure to ultraviolet
rays of the sun. But Rigel said the increasing rate of the disease
among the young suggests that the time it takes to develop the
disease may be decreasing.
   A loss of ozone in the atmosphere ``might be the explanation of
why people are getting it younger and younger _ maybe. That has been
brought up as a hypothesis,'' said Rigel. ``For every decrease of 1
percent in the ozone layer, there is a 2 percent increase in the
incidence of skin cancer.''
   Ozone is a natural atmospheric gas that partially blocks
ultraviolet solar rays from reaching the Earth's surface. Studies in
recent years have shown that some types of chemical pollutants,
principally the fluorocarbons used for refrigerants and solvents,
destroy atmospheric ozone, thus allowing more ultraviolet radiation
to reach Earth.
   Counterbalancing the ozone-loss effect is a growing consciousness
about dangers from excessive exposure to the sun, Rigel said. He
said more people are using sun screen, a skin lotion that filters
ultraviolet rays.
   ``People are so much more sun-conscious than they were just five
years ago,'' Rigel said in an interview. ``The use of sun screen has
risen very dramatically.''
   Many parents now know that sun damage on the skins of children
under the age of 10 can result in cancer among those youngsters
before they are 30, said Rigel. As a result, he said, even children
now are using sun screen.
   ``We won't begin to see the effects of that sun screen usage for
another 10 to 20 years from now,'' he said. ``The hope is that by
the turn of the century, the sun screen use and more common sense
about avoiding the sun will kick in'' to cause a decline in skin
cancers.
   If not, said Rigel, melanoma may strike one in every 90 Americans
by the year 2000.
   Melanoma first appears as a black, brown or mixed colored spot of
irregular shape on the skin's surface. Left untreated, the cancer
penetrates to the interior of the skin and releases cells that can
move through the bloodstream and establish colonies in the bone,
brain, lung or even heart. Once this happens, the disease cannot be
cured, Rigel said.
   But if the cancer is detected early, when it is still about the
size of a pencil eraser, it easily can be cut from the skin and cure
is almost certain, he said.
   Rigel said the number of melanoma cases in the United States has
almost doubled during the last eight years, and the number of deaths
has tripled, to about 5,800, since 1960. However, the survival rate
for melanoma patients has risen from 60 percent in the 1960s, to
about 83 percent now.

<HEAD>Atlantis Astronauts Get Day Off After Shuttle Landing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Atlantis' five astronauts relaxed
with their families Wednesday, but they planned to return to work
the next day to begin briefing NASA and Air Force officials on their
secret shuttle mission.
   Crew members ended their four-day flight Tuesday with a smooth
touchdown at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. They left for Houston
several hours later, arriving home early Wednesday.
   After getting a day off, the astronauts will begin several weeks
of debriefings on their classified military flight. NASA and the Air
Force have refused to discuss the mission's main goal, but sources
said it was deployment of a $500 million satellite that can spy on
the Soviet Union through clouds and darkness and will someday serve
as a ``radar eye'' for the new stealth bomber.
   Atlantis' crew members were Navy Cmdr. Robert Gibson, the
commander; Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner, the pilot; Air Force
Col. Richard M. Mullane, Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross and Navy
Cmdr. William M. Shepherd. The flight was the first trip to space
for both Gardner and Shepherd.
   More than 200 people welcomed the astronauts home when they
arrived at Ellington Field, compared with the nearly 5,000
well-wishers who turned out for the celebrated return of Discovery's
five astronauts.
   ``I can't believe all of you are out here at one o'clock in the
morning,'' Gibson said. ``This is incredible. I expected just a hop
in the cars and go.''
   ``It really was a great flight,'' Gardner said. ``I think we did
a good job for NASA and the space program and I think we did some
good things for our country.''
   The crowd was small but enthusiastic, cheering the astronauts and
their wives as they stepped off two NASA planes. After making brief
remarks, the crew members spent several minutes shaking hands and
hugging their friends and co-workers.
   At Edwards, which was closed to the public because the flight was
classified, only a few hundred journalists, NASA employees and
invited guests watched as Gibson guided the 97-ton shuttle to a 3:35
p.m. PST touchdown on the packed clay runway in the Mojave Desert.
   The landing time apparently was dictated by the orbit Atlantis
had to follow in deploying the radar satellite. NASA prefers morning
landings at Edwards because winds tend to gather force later in the
day.
   Although NASA and the Air Force permitted live television
coverage of the landing, as they did for Friday's blastoff from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., everything in between was blacked out.
   About an hour after touchdown, the crew and several NASA
officials inspected the orbiter and NASA cameras showed underside
scarring to the shuttle, including ``dings'' to the black protective
tiles.
   The damage to the tiles ``appeared to be a lot more'' than usual,
NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato said.
   Atlantis will remain at the base for several days for servicing.
It then will be mounted on a modified jumbo jetliner for a piggyback
ride home to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
   Atlantis' flight was the 27th shuttle mission and the second
since the 1986 Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts and
halted manned space missions for 32 months. It was the third
dedicated solely to the military.

   The leftist government and the Roman
Catholic Church are at odds, but both are taking the day off
Thursday to celebrate the religious feast of the Immaculate
Conception of the Virgin Mary.
   It's one of the nation's most important holidays, celebrating the
Roman Catholic belief that Mary was conceived without original sin.
   Traditionally, Nicaraguans take to the streets the eve of the
feast, visiting altars erected in front of homes and chanting hymns
of praise. Owners of a home where the altar is erected distribute
candy, fruit and toys and offer pastries and cocoa drinks to
visitors who go on to other altars for additional goodies.
   Fireworks explode through the night and groups meet each other
chanting: ``What causes so much happiness? Mary's Immaculate
Conception.''
   The chants and celebration are known as the ``Griteria,'' or
``the Shouting.''
   The Roman Catholic Church has celebrated the feast for centuries
and the Sandinista government, accused by the church of following a
Marxist ideology, has yielded to popular tradition.
   Devotion to the Virgin Mary, rooted in the soul of Catholic
Spain, is common in the Spanish-speaking countries, notably among
them Mexico and its patron saint, the Virgin of Guadalupe.
   The Nicaraguan Church says the government is trying to capitalize
on the people's religiosity for its own political ends.
   ``They try to take the religious aspect away to concentrate more
on the giving of candy, bread and sugar cane and the secular
celebrations,'' said Monsignor Bismarck Carballo, director of the
Catholic Radio Station.
   The church encourages the faithful to celebrate the old way with
neighborhood altars and gatherings.
   Government officials including President Daniel Ortega, who has
called Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo a reactionary and a
counterrevolutionary, visit altars built by government agencies and
join in celebrating and distributing gifts.
   Interior Minister Tomas Borge, a critic of the Church and its
hierarchy, has said that ``as long as there is a revolution there
will be a celebration of the Immaculate Conception.''
   Government newspapers filled pages this week with interviews with
old Managua residents who recalled the folkloric celebrations of the
early century in a bucolic Managua that had not yet heard of
revolution.
   Chico Gurdian, 75, told the newspaper Barricada that after the
religious celebration in the old days, ``We turned the (statue of)
Virgin around so she would not see and everybody started dancing.''
   On Wednesday, soldiers in blue berets were busy building the
Sandinista Army's altar just off a wide avenue lined by eucalyptus
trees. Behind the Virgin was a large painting showing Nicaraguan
mountains with army helicopoters flying over them.
   Another government agency built an altar that bore the sign,
``Mary, energy for reconstruction.''
   Religious or political, the feast is a brief respite in a country
hard hit by civil war, a hurricane, runaway inflation and low wages.
A few blocks from the altars, a store advertised simple two-slice
toasters for $60 _ more than a secretary earns in a month.

   Barbara Bush took charge at an exclusive U.N.
luncheon today for Raisa Gorbachev and Nancy Reagan, putting
everyone at ease with her good humor and jokes.
   ``How do you say `cheese' in Russian?'' Mrs. Bush, the wife of
President-elect George Bush, quipped as the three women stood for a
formal picture with Marcela Perez de Cuellar at her posh East Side
townhouse.
   Mrs. Bush, standing next to the Soviet first lady, seemed intent
on defusing any problems at the gathering, the last for the U.S. and
Soviet first ladies, who have had their run-ins on previous
occasions.
   As the translator interpreted the word ``cheese'' for Mrs.
Gobachev and Mrs. Bush, the group broke out in smiles and laughter.
   As photographers encouraged the women to smile, Mrs. Gorbachev
said, ``We can't see you. That's why we don't smile.''
   The women posed for their portrait prior to joining 20 other
women at an elegant luncheon downstairs in a room with a marble
fireplace, crystal chandelier and tall windows overlooking the East
River. Each place was set with crystal bearing the U.N. insignia and
at every place setting lay a small present wrapped in a peach bow.
   Mrs. Gorbachev spoke through an interpreter inside the town house
but outside had responded to reporters' entreaties to speak with
them and spoke partially in English.
   ``I'm happy to be here in this city you call `The Big Apple,'''
she told reporters, saying the words the big apple in English.
   The Soviet first lady was expected to continue her sightseeing in
New York with a vist to the Estee Lauder cosmetic headquarters and
an automobile tour of Manhattan with her husband, who had lunch at
Governors Island with President Reagan and Bush.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Reagan pooh-poohed reports that she and Mrs.
Gorbachev had feuded in the past. She said she intended to wish the
Soviet first lady _ an avowed Marxist-Leninist and atheist _ a merry
Christmas.
   During a tour of the U.N. earlier today, Mrs. Gorbachev, dressed
in a sober grey suit with an aqua blouse, strolled with Mrs. Perez
de Cuellar through the modern glass and steel building, pausing to
chat repeatedly and look at many of its international artworks. Mrs.
Perez de Cuellar, attired in a green and black Harlequin-like suit
ruffled at neck and cuff, explained several of the works that have
been donated to the international organization by member nations.
   Mrs. Gorbachev noted that the Soviets intended to donate a bronze
sculpture later in the day.
   She viewed a tapestry reproduction of Picasso's famed artwork of
the Spanish civil war bombing of a village, ``Guernica,'' and used
the occasion to say the Soviet Union is interested in peaceful
endeavors.
   Listening to an explanation of how the tapestry was made, Mrs.
Gorbachev said, ``It also symbolizes the terror of war.''
   Pausing at one point to greet about 150 U.N. workers, she said
through a translator, ``I wish you every success in your work. You
work in an organization that makes great contributions to the cause
of peace.''
   ``We like you,'' someone called out from the crowd, a comment met
by smiles on the part of Mrs. Gorbachev and her hostess, as well as
applause from the assemblage.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Reagan said she hoped Mrs. Gorbachev would have
a good time in New York, which is decked out for the holiday season.
   As to talk of a feud, she said, ``I think there's been too much
attention paid to it. I do. I really do.''
   Asked whether they were really ``on the same wave length,'' Mrs.
Reagan replied, ``Oh, of course not.'' And asked if they shared
similar philosophies, she answered,``Of course not, that's a given.''
   At their last meeting in Moscow, Mrs. Reagan had made repeated
attempts to discuss the religious implications of the icon artworks
that she saw, while Mrs. Gorbachev chose to discuss their
sociological or historical importance.
   The two women ended the Moscow summit last spring contesting for
time with reporters at an icon gallery.
   The two first ladies have come together 16 times according to a
count kept by Mrs. Reagan's press secretary Elaine Crispen. Mrs.
Crispen said she knew of five events at the first summit in Geneva
in November 1985, five at the December 1987 summit in Washington,
and six last spring in Moscow. They include arrival or departure
ceremonies, one-on-one meetings or social gatherings that the two
women attended together.
   Mrs. Reagan did not attend the October 1986 U.S.-Soviet summit in
Iceland.

   The flags, the U.S. seal, the decor and the
Bible for George Bush's inauguration will look a lot like those from
George Washington's oath-taking 200 years ago at Federal Hall in New
York.
   But the bicentennial inauguration Jan. 20 will also be marked by
some departures from tradition _ including security screening for
the more than 140,000 guests expected to attend the ceremony.
   ``My worst nightmare is that 50,000 people will show up at 11:20
a.m. for a ceremony that starts at 11:30,'' said Michael Ruehling,
executive director of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural
Ceremonies.
   For the first time, those with inauguration tickets will have to
walk through metal detectors to get to their seats. The four gates
will open at 9 a.m. and a musical prelude is scheduled to start 90
minutes later, all in an attempt to get people to come early.
   ``The only thing we're not providing is popcorn,'' Ruehling said.
``I don't know what else we can do, but it does scare me.''
   The inauguration will wait for no one, invited guest or not,
since the Constitution stipulates the oath must be taken at noon.
   The security precautions are the most obvious change from past
practice, but there are other new twists as well. For the first time
ever, the inaugural program will contain the names of the president
and vice president; in the past they were referred to by title only.
Another first: The program will include a four-page history of
inaugurations in commemoration of the bicentennial.
   ``We want to make it a little extra special if we can,'' Ruehling
said of the Bush inauguration.
   Capitol historians and architects have thoroughly researched the
Washington inauguration, and the design for the ceremonial backdrop
reflects their work.
   For example, the archway of the door to the West Front, where
Bush and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle will enter, will be draped
in red bunting similar to the bunting used on the Federal Hall door
in 1789.
   Two flags with 13 stars representing the original 13 states will
be part of the backdrop along with two 38-star flags from 1889 and
the current 50-state flag.
   Bush will likely take the oath of office on the Bible used by
Washington and several presidents since, including Jimmy Carter. And
all inaugural materials will be imprinted with the First Great Seal
of the United States, used as the national emblem from 1782 to 1841.
   At the first inauguration, Washington simply bowed to his
audience, repeated the 35-word oath of office and added at the end,
``I swear, so help me God.''
   Subsequent ceremonies were more elaborate, with music, speeches
and services, and this year is no exception. Participants include
the U.S. Marine and Army bands, the Harlan (Ky.) Boys Choir, and the
Rev. Billy Graham, who will deliver the invocation and the
benediction.
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist will administer the oath of
office to Bush, while Justice Sandra Day O'Connor will swear in
Quayle, the committee said Wednesday.
   More than 500 choruses, bands, bell-ringers and other groups
inundated the congressional committee with requests to perform, most
of them seeking to participate in the inaugural parade to the White
House. Their letters were dispatched to the Presidential Inaugural
Committee, the private group in charge of the parade and other
festivities.
   The Bush inauguration marks only the second time the ceremony has
been held on the Capitol's West Front. From his podium, Bush will
have a panoramic view of the grass-carpeted Smithsonian Mall, the
soaring Washington Monument and many grand buildings of the city.
   President Reagan was sworn in there in 1981. But most
inaugurations have taken place on the East Front, which overlooks
the asphalt Capitol parking area as well as the carefully landscaped
Capitol grounds.
   The inauguration platform and stands under construction on the
West Front are costing $323,000 to build. Taxpayers are footing the
bill for the inaugural preparations and also for an hour-long
catered lunch that precedes the traditional parade down Pennsylvania
Avenue to the White House.
   The quadrennial meal in the Capitol's Statuary Hall will be
attended by about 200 people, among them the president and vice
president, their families, and congressional leaders. Following long
custom, Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., chairman of the congressional
inaugural committee, will toast the new president and present him
with a gift.
   ``We've got a good one,'' Ruehling said. `You'll find out what it
is on Jan. 20.''

   Mikhail Gorbachev, President Reagan and George
Bush shared a lunchtime summit on Wednesday spiced by the Soviet
leader's call for a ``period of peace'' and announcement of a
unilateral cut of 500,000 Red Army troops.
   In a day of superpower substance and symbolism, the Soviet
president answered Bush's welcoming handshake with a vigorous
two-handed embrace. He declared that the president-elect would find
the Soviets ready ``without long pauses or backtracking'' to
continue improving relations.
   Reagan said he ``heartily'' approved of Gorbachev's overtures,
made in a United Nations speech, and said ``we certainly would
adjust'' Western troop strength downward ``if this left us with a
superiority.''
   ``We've accomplished much. There are still things to do,'' he
said before sitting down for the fifth and final time with his
superpower partner.
   Gorbachev used his U.N. speech to declare that military force no
longer ``can or must be an instrument of foreign policy.'' He said
50,000 Soviet troops and 5,000 tanks would be pulled out of Eastern
Europe by 1991, and pledged reductions on Western and Eastern soil
within the Soviet Union, as well. Overall, the reductions were to
reach half a million.
   Gorbachev also called for steps to end the war in Afghanistan
under U.N. auspices within a month and urged international
cooperation on issues ranging from arms control to the environment.
   ``I would like to believe that our hopes will be matched by our
joint efforts to put an end to an era of wars, confrontation and
regional conflicts, aggressions against nature, terror of hunger and
poverty, as well as political terrorism,'' he said in an hour-long
speech.
   The U.N. speech and summit talks came on the second of
Gorbachev's three days in New York. Thursday is devoted to
sightseeing, and the Soviet leader departs for Cuba on Friday.
   In a speech to an audience that included his wife, Raisa,
Secretary of State George Shultz and a hall filled with diplomats,
Gorbachev pledged to continue his reform of Soviet society, as well.
And he said that nations should ``look for ways together to improve
the international system and build a new world.''
   ``It is now quite clear that building up military power makes no
country omnipotent,'' Gorbachev declared. ``What's more, one-sided
reliance on military power ultimately weakens other components of
national security.''
   From the United Nations, the Soviet leader went to Governors
Island in New York Harbor, where a smiling Reagan greeted him. The
two men shook hands in the sunshine and posed for photographers.
   ``If we score any points we can do it only together,'' Gorbachev
said. ``If we try to score points alone nothing good will happen.''
   A few moments later Bush emerged to join them, and when the
president-elect offered his hand in welcome, Gorbachev grasped it
energetically with both of his own.
   Gorbachev, Reagan and Bush broke bread inside the brick and
columned Admirals House while their wives were being entertained at
a ladies-only luncheon in Manhattan sponsored by the wife of U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   ``I am happy to be in the city you call the Big Apple,'' Mrs.
Gorbachev said.
   Across town at Governors Island, the lunch menu began with
chicken consomme followed by filets of veal with smoked quail and
lobster sausage and ended with a chocolate tart with raspberry
sauce. The wine was from Reagan's home state of California.
   New York police said dozens of demonstrators were arrested
outside the U.N. after they crossed police lines to protest
treatment of Jews in the Soviet Union.
   It was the first time a Soviet leader had spoken to the United
Nations in 28 years, and the contrast couldn't have been more
striking.
   In 1960, Nikita Krushchev pounded the podium with his shoe in one
of the most memorable gestures of belligerence of the Cold War.
   In contrast, Gorbachev spoke calmly and sprinkled references to
peace and progress throughout his remarks. His most notable contrary
word was a brief criticism of the Reagan administration's decision
to deny a visa to PLO leader Yasser Arafat.
   He called for a ``period of peace'' and noted that Cold War
politicians ``find it particularly hard to abandon old stereotypes
and past practices.'' In apparent reference to Reagan and British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, he said, some ``are now drawing
the appropriate conclusions.''
   His most dramatic announcement was his declaration of troop cuts.
He said his nation will ``maintain our country's defense capability
at a level of reasonable and reliable sufficiency'' to deter attacks.
   Asked later as he posed for pictures with Reagan and Bush whether
he was getting resistance from the Soviet military establishment, he
smiled and said, ``Nyet, nyet, nyet.'' Back home, however, the
Soviets announced the retirement of their longtime military chief of
staff for health reasons.
   Specifically, Gorbachev said he would withdraw 50,000 troops and
5,000 tanks from East Germany, Huyngary and Czechoslovakia by 1991.
It is estimated that the Soviets maintain 500,000 troops there; the
Warsaw Pact holds a 2.5-to-1 troop edge over NATO in conventional
strength.
   Gorbachev said many of the forces to be pulled out of Europe,
including six tank divisions, would be disbanded.
   He said overall he would reduce the Red Army by 500,000 men.
Western officials estimate the Soviet army has an overall strength
of about 5.6 million men.
   Gorbachev said he intended to move his economy to ``an economy of
disarmament'' and would develop and publish plans for converting its
defense plants and shifting military specialists into civilian
industry.
   In other parts of his speech, Gorbachev called for U.N.
peacekeeping forces to help assure the ``neutrality and
demilitarization'' of Afghanistan, where a Soviet occupation force
that once numbered more than 100,000 troops is being withdrawn.
   He called for a ceasefire beginning Jan. 1, and challenged the
United States to stop shipping arms to Afghan rebels.
   He also:
   _ Announced the Soviet Union would soon reform its penal code,
and said Soviet Jews seeking to leave would be handled in a ``humane
spirit.'' Still, he said, those citizens with knowledge of state
secrets would not be permitted to emigrate.
   _ Proposd creating an international organization that would help
Third World countries alleviate their massive debt payments. He said
the Soviet Union would be willing to enforce a 100-year moratorium
on debt repayment for some countries, and cancel debts altogether in
some cases.
   _ Proposed an international space lab devoted to environmental
protection, although he said quickly that any space mission must
``rule out the appearance of weapons'' there.

   Barbara Bush surprised Christmas shoppers
Wednesday with a stop at Tiffany's before her luncheon meeting with
first ladies Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev.
   Secret Service agents stationed in front of the famed jewelers on
Fifth Avenue first attracted a crowd as Mrs. Bush went inside to
browse.
   ``We're not shopping,'' she called out with a smile as customers
stopped to wish her well. Mrs. Bush made a quick stop at the store
to have her watch repaired, a store spokeswoman said.
   ``It's Mrs. Bush,'' one woman discreetly whispered to a friend as
the soon-to-be first lady peered into display cases.
   She engaged in small talk with those who stopped to congratulate
her on her husband George's election victory and signed an autograph
for Joshua Steinberg, 9, of Brooklyn.
   Referring to advance predictions of monumental traffic problems
because of the visit of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Mrs.
Bush said, ``I didn't think the traffic was so bad _ but it's pretty
bad in here.''
   Then she told the crowd, which was pressed shoulder-to-shoulder
in the crowded jewelry store: ``Now you all go shop.''

   It's The Brent Farris Morning Shows _
all three of them.
   There used to be just one Brent Farris Morning Show, and that was
the adult contemporary music program on radio station KZST. But then
Brent Farris grew tired of getting junk mail addressed to his show.
   ``These underwear companies kept mailing me these underwear
catalogs and I didn't want them,'' he explained.
   So, he offered $1,000 to the first person who legally changed
their name to The Brent Farris Morning Show. He figured that person
would start getting his underwear ads.
   This prompted Donna Johnson to file a fictitious business
statement with the county saying she was doing business as The Brent
Farris Morning Show. Then Cynthia Machado legally changed her name
to The Brent Farris Morning Show.
   After some negotiations, the women agreed to split the money. As
the disc jockey explained it, the one who was first had not legally
changed her name, and the one who legally changed her name wasn't
first.
   And will all this keep the real Brent Farris from getting
underwear ads? Of course not.
   ``It won't keep me from getting them,'' he said. ``But at least
now I have someone to send them to.''

   Commuters on Miami's Metromover could have heard
wank-wank-TUNK or tinker-tee-tink every time the doors opened on the
mass transit system this week.
   Instead, they'll hear the same old ding dong.
   Dade County transit officials rejected plans to set up a sound
exhibit that was to begin Sunday as part of the New Music America
Festival, calling the bongo drums, Indian chants and other sounds
signaling the door opening unsafe because they might cause the doors
to open unexpectedly.
   Canadian artist Gordon Manahan, who created a set of 11
pre-recorded sounds, called the decision ``blatant censorship.''
   Jeffrey Kaplan, the agency's deputy director, acknowledged he
wasn't thrilled with the Eskimo mouth harp that sounded like an
alarm or a radio disc jockey jabbering in Italian, but was only
concerned about safety.
   Some commuters didn't seem to notice during a test run of the
music, and others noticed but couldn't tell what they were hearing.
   ``I was wondering if there was some kind of subliminal message
behind it,'' downtown commuter Ralph Pujol said after hearing an
electronic ``cha cha'' and some tribal music. ``It's definitely
strange, but it's strange in a neat way. It adds to the mystique of
Miami.''

<HEAD>Bank Board Chairman Suggests Surprises In Dealing With S&Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top federal regulator for savings and loan
companies said Wednesday he may have some surprises for the ailing
industry and will continue to order more liquidations, acquisitions
or mergers of S&Ls this month.
   W. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, told
an advisory group of bankers and others affected by the industry
that the three-member board is still considering actions to take but
has ``focused on a direction.''
   He said the moves would be ``very positive for the industry'' but
may not be what anyone expects.
   ``I have nothing more to say other than `stay tuned,''' said
Wall, who had made a similar statement to a National Council of
Savings Institutions in New York a day earlier. ``Hold onto your
hats,'' he told the S&L executives. ``We are going to be taking
steps that are going to surprise everyone.''
   The council and the larger U.S. League of Savings Institutions
have sharply different views on how to approach the industry crisis.
Estimates of the amount of money it will take to bail out or
liquidate failing S&Ls range from $50 billion to $100 billion.
   The council, two thirds of whose members are savings banks whose
deposits are presently insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., proposed on Tuesday that the FDIC insure all savings
institutions, not just banks.
   The proposal would dismantle the nearly bankrupt Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp. after about five years, during which the
insurer would liquidate the remaining insolvent S&Ls. FSLIC insures
deposits in S&Ls but no longer has enough money in its accounts to
cover deposits in all those expected to fail.
   The larger league, which includes some S&Ls that are not healthy
enough to join the FDIC, wants to retain the separate systems for
savings institutions and banks.
   Wall made no comment on those differing proposals, but said the
board is examining several ideas for dealing with the industry's
problems.
   He said up to 60 financially troubled savings institutions will
have been dealt with by the end of 1988, with about 200 more to be
dealt with next year.
   A large proportion of the S&L's the board has had to deal with
are in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas and New Mexico, where
low oil and natural gas prices have hurt the economies.
   Board member Roger Martin noted that the bulk of savings
institutions remain strong and suggested that the industry conduct a
campaign to counteract the bad publicity that inevitably will result
from continued S&L liquidations.

   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner
on Wednesday welcomed the announcement by Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev of a unilateral cut in Soviet military forces, a
spokesman said.
   The U.S. mission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization called
Gorbachev's speech at the United Nations ``a positive step.''
   ``Obviously, we need to study it carefully but note that
significant asymmetries would remain even if all these steps were
taken,'' said a spokesman at the mission, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Gorbachev announced the cuts in a speech to the General Assembly
in New York. It came on the eve of a two-day meeting of Secretary of
State George Shultz and other foreign ministers of the 16-nation
Western alliance.
   In response to the Soviet announcement, NATO spokesman Florent
Swijsen said Woerner ``welcomes any measure that may lead to long
overdue reductions of overwhelming Warsaw Pact superiority in
conventional forces in Europe.''
   The announcement, he said, ``seems to be a step in the right
direction for which we have been calling for a long time.''
   ``It will now be analyzed by the allies and we will be looking
carefully for the follow-up of Mr. Gorbachev's statement,'' Swijsen
said.
   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union will unilaterally cut its
military forces by 500,000 troops and reduce its conventional arms
substantially. The military, he said, ``no longer can or must be an
instrument of foreign policy.''
   He said the move comes ``without relation'' to international
negotiations on conventional forces in Europe. But his offer would
likely give a new push to those stalled talks in Vienna, Austria, on
reducing Warsaw Pact and NATO conventional forces in Central Europe.
   While meeting Thursday and Friday, the NATO foreign ministers are
expected to discuss their position in the arms negotiations, called
the Conventional Stability Talks. Those talks are expected to get
under way early next year.
   NATO officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said the
ministers will likely issue a statement at the end of their talks
setting forth the outline of their common strategy.
   Woerner, however, declined to confirm that. ``Our goal is clear:
to reach stability at lower levels of arms and to get it by
reductions ... on both sides,'' he told reporters earlier in the day.
   ``There is one clear principle,'' he said, ``that who has more
has to cut more. We have to get rid of imbalances.''
   ``There are disparities and these disparities are in favor of the
Warsaw Pact,'' he said. ``So of course we have to expect that since
the Warsaw Pact has much more arms ... they have to reduce much
more.''
   A NATO report that compared conventional forces stationed in
Europe said that as of January 1988 the Warsaw Pact countries had
3,090,000 ground forces (personnel) while NATO had 2,213,593.
   The report also said the Warsaw Pact countries also had at least
twice as many battle tanks, artillery, anti-tank weapons and combat
aircraft stationed in Europe than NATO countries do.

<HEAD>Grandson Says Permission To Visit Soviet A Sign of Trotsky Comeback</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leon Trotsky's grandson says the fact that
he's been given permission to visit his sister in the Soviet Union
is another sign the revolutionary leader is slowly recovering his
rightful place in history.
   Esteban Volkow Bronstein said he was recently granted a visa to
visit his half-sister, Trotsky's granddaughter Alexandra
Zakharonavna, who is dying of cancer in Moscow.
   ``It's all part of (Soviet leader Mikhail) Gorbachev's policy,
I'm sure,'' Volkow said in a Tuesday night interview with The
Associated Press.
   Volkow said he had not seen his sister since 1931, when he was 5
years old. That was the year his mother fled the Soviet Union,
taking him but leaving his older sister behind.
   Volkow was living with Trotsky in Mexico City when the former
head of the Red Army was assassinated on Josef Stalin's orders on
Aug. 20, 1940. Volkow was only 14 but still remembers finding
Trotsky on the floor, dying from serious head wounds.
   Trotsky, born Lev Davidovich Bronstein, was one of the leaders of
the October 1917 revolution that established the Soviet Union, but
he lost a power struggle with Stalin, went into exile and became a
non-person, vilified in the his native land.
   Volkow, a 62-year-old retired chemical engineer, has been
watching from Mexico City as Trotsky's name is brought out of what
Volkow called the ``the dark cave'' of Soviet history.
   There was a minor sensation when Gorbachev mentioned Trotsky in a
speech last year. In September, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda
called Trotsky an ``enemy of Stalin'' rather than an enemy of
socialism and the revolution.
   Last month, the Soviet Supreme Court rehabilitated a son,
Volkow's step-uncle Sergei Sedov, who died in 1937 in Stalin's
purges.
   ``Stalin shot him because he was Trotsky's son. He wasn't
political at all. He was just a technician,'' Volkow said of Sedov.
   Volkow said he understands why the changes have been coming
slowly.
   ``You can't change black to white in one day,'' said Volkow.
   Volkow said that until last month he had known nothing of his
sister's fate except for a reference in a book published 10 years
ago that showed she was still alive.
   He said he had asked friends traveling to Moscow to try to find
her several times, but none could until Pierre Broue, a historian
and Trotsky specialist at the University of Grenoble in France,
located her in November.
   ``I haven't been able to talk to her, really, because I don't
speak Russian, except for a few phrases that I memorized to say to
her,'' said Volkow. ``She doesn't have long to live.''
   He said Zakharonavna, only a year older than Volkow, had spent 10
years in Stalin's prison camps solely because she was a relative of
Trotsky.
   ``She's suffered a lot, and now she's very weak,'' said Volkow.
   He said he will leave for Italy next week to appear on a
television show about his grandfather, then fly to Moscow for a
four-day visit before Christmas.
   Now a Mexican citizen, Volkow said he had never tried to get a
visa to visit the Soviet Union before, in part because until now he
was sure it would be denied.
   Volkow said he himself is not a Trotskyist believer in
international revolution, but he fiercely defends his grandfather
and says Trotsky was too important for his role in Soviet history to
remain distorted.
   ``It can't be hidden,'' he said.

<HEAD>Roy Orbison Dead at 52; Rock 'N' Roll Pioneer Was Making Comeback</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rock 'n' roll pioneer Roy Orbison, whose
surging falsetto mourned the misery of fading romance and who
recently had become popular with a new generation of fans, was
felled by a heart attack and died. He was 52.
   The Grammy Award-winning Orbison, famed for hits like ``Oh,
Pretty Woman,'' ``Only the Lonely'' and ``Crying,'' died shortly
before midnight Tuesday at Hendersonville Hospital, where he had
been taken by ambulance, said Melanie Lamb, a spokeswoman for the
suburban Nashville hospital.
   ``He was and always will be one of the greats of rock 'n' roll,''
said former Beatle Paul McCartney. ``We toured with Roy in the early
days and he was a really good guy.''
   A singer, guitarist and songwriter who was instantly recognizable
by his ever-present sunglasses and dark attire set off by an ebony
pompadour, Orbison had 27 straight records on the charts during his
heyday in the early 1960s.
   But his biggest success came with ``Oh, Pretty Woman,'' about a
flirtatious episode, which sold more than 7 million copies in 1964.
A cover version later was a hit for Van Halen.
   In 1977, Elvis Presley, one year Orbison's senior, introduced him
as ``the greatest singer in the world.'' Bruce Springsteen saluted
him in his song ``Thunder Road.''
   Last year, he re-recorded his 1963 hit ``In Dreams'' after the
song had been revived in the movie ``Blue Velvet.''
   But it was Orbison's recent recordings as one of The Traveling
Wilburys _ along with ex-Beatle George Harrison, Tom Petty, Bob
Dylan and Jeff Lynne _ that brought him a new generation of fans.
The group's ``Handle With Care'' is No. 45 on the charts, and their
swift-selling album ``The Traveling Wilburys'' is No. 8.
   The upturn in his career surprised him, Orbison said last week as
he was leaving London's Heathrow Airport for home.
   ``I've been rediscovered by young kids who had never heard of me
before the Wilburys,'' he said. ``They are getting into my original
songs and apparently the old stuff is selling at the rate of 20,000
copies a day.''
   ``It's very nice to be wanted again, but I still can't quite
believe it.''
   Harrison, in England, was too shocked at news of Orbison's death
to comment, said Warner Bros. spokesman Bob Merlis.
   Orbison was upbeat a few weeks ago when he met with record
producer Fred Foster, who had worked with the singer since the early
days.
   ``He seemed in good health. He was exercising and all that,''
Foster said Wednesday. ``He was the most talented man I ever worked
with.''
   Orbison got his early recording experience in the 1950s with Sun
Records of Memphis, the label that launched the careers of Elvis
Presley, Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Lewis. He was one of the first
``rockabilly'' singers _ a hybrid of rock 'n' roll and hillbilly
music, as country music was known then.
   His career peaked in the first half of the '60s but tailed off in
the aftermath of two family tragedies: His wife died in a motorcycle
accident in 1966, and in 1968, two of his three sons, ages 10 and 6,
died in a fire that destroyed his $150,000 lakeside home.
   His third son is in his 20s, and he had two teen-age sons from
his second marriage. His wife and three sons survive him. The family
lived in Nashville.
   ``A little hurt went a long way,'' he said in a 1986 Associated
Press interview. His song ``Too Soon to Know'' was inspired by the
death of his wife.
   Some of his big hits were ``Blue Bayou,'' ``It's Over,'' ``Mean
Woman Blues,'' and ``Dream Baby.'' He won a Grammy Award for his
1980 collaboration with Emmylou Harris on ``That Loving You Feeling
Again.''
   In addition to ``The Traveling Wilburys,'' two of his most recent
albums were ``Class of '55'' and ``The Great Roy Orbison.''
   On Sept. 30, 1987, Orbison gave a concert at Los Angeles'
Cocoanut Grove nightclub, ``Roy Orbison and Friends: A
Black-and-White Night.'' The friends were Springsteen, Elvis
Costello, Jackson Browne, Tom Waits, T-Bone Burnett and J.D.
Souther, with Bonnie Rait, Jennifer Warnes and K.D. Lang singing
backup.
   Orbison's penchant for sunglasses and dark clothing created a
mysterious persona that was heightened by his natural reclusiveness.
   The image was partly an accident, born when Orbison accidently
left his regular glasses at home and had to wear the shades while
performing in London in 1963. He liked the image so much that he
wore them constantly, giving some people the false impression that
he was blind.
   Rock 'n' roll singer Carl Perkins, who joined Orbison, Lewis and
Cash on the album ``Class of '55,'' said Orbison was ``was the kind
of man who you would like to have living next door so you could lay
some tomatoes on the fence for him.''
   Orbison, a native of Vernon, Texas, grew up in Wink, Texas, and
learned guitar from his father, an oil field worker. He played
guitar on a radio station at age 8 and was in a country band by age
14.
   With an impressive three-octave range, he continued to perform
concerts right up to his death, appearing Sunday in Akron, Ohio,
before 2,000 people.
   ``I don't feel I'm the guy I should be unless I'm writing and
performing and singing,'' he said in the 1986 interview.
   He estimated at that time that he had sold 30 million records.
   ``One day when they are mentioning people who had an impact, if
they just mention me among the rest of the guys and gals, it would
be great,'' he said when asked how he wanted to be remembered.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete Wednesday.

<HEAD>Geremek Receives Passport to Go to France</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A close adviser to Lech Walesa obtained a
passport Wednesday to accompany the Solidarity leader to France on
his first foreign visit in seven years, an opposition activist said.
   Historian Bronislaw Geremek picked up the passport in Warsaw,
said Jacek Czaputowicz, a founder of the Freedom and Peace
opposition group who said he ran into Geremek at the passport office
while applying for his own passport.
   Walesa, the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has been invited by
French President Francois Mitterrand to attend observances Saturday
of the 40th anniversary of the Declaration of the Universal Rights
of Man. The date, Dec. 10, is observed as International Human Rights
Day.
   Walesa was told Saturday that he could make the trip, but he said
it also was necessary for Geremek, who speaks fluent French and
whose specialty is French medieval history, to accompany him.
   The trip marks the first time Walesa has received permission to
leave Poland since the imposition of martial law at the end of 1981.
His last foreign trip also was to Paris, in October 1981.
   Geremek said Sunday that he has been refused a passport on all
five occasions recently when he applied. But a government spokesman
signaled Tuesday that this time it would be granted.
   Walesa was to leave for Paris on Friday and return Sunday,
accouring to a senior adviser, Adam Michnik.
   Another intellectual adviser to Walesa, Andrzej Wielowieyski, a
leader of the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia in Warsaw, said by
telephone Wednesday that he too would be part of the Solidarity
leader's entourage in France.
   Czaputowicz, a longtime peace and ecology activist, has been
invited by West German President Richard von Weizsaecker to take
part in Bonn's observances of International Human Rights Day on
Saturday.
   He did not receive his passport Wednesday, but said he expected
to pick it up on Thursday.

<HEAD>Trump, In Court, Defends Purchase of Eastern Shuttle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire Donald J. Trump offered his
philosophy of business success and vowed Wednesday to give employees
a ``major boost in morale'' if he were allowed to buy Eastern
Airlines' Northeast shuttle.
   Trump flashed a wide smile at the judge's female law clerks and
shook hands with the bailiff during a short break in his testimony
at a federal court hearing on the $365 million deal that is being
challenged by Eastern's unions.
   ``The most important asset of the enterprise is the employees,''
Trump said. ``They are wonderful. They need a major boost in morale
_ that's 90 percent of the problem.''
   But Trump, who insisted he has already befriended Eastern's
shuttle employees during his frequent travels, declined to guarantee
current wages for flight attendants, pilots and other workers.
   ``I can't answer that question now,'' Trump replied. ``I want my
employees to be happy, I want my employees to be well paid, I want
my employees to do a good job.''
   ``In order to have a competitive and successful airline, I do not
know what's going to have to take place,'' he said.
   Trump, whose Manhattan hotels and Atlantic City gambling casinos
have become glittering symbols of business success, said he wanted
to purchase the shuttle to restore ``a great institution'' to the
grandeur it once enjoyed.
   ``Over the last number of years, I've seen it deteriorate very
unfortunately,'' Trump testified.
   Trump compared the Boston-to-New York-to Washington shuttle to
New York's Plaza Hotel, ``which hadn't been run right'' until he
purchased it.
   ``I really look forward to the chance of putting it back on track
and doing something with it,'' Trump said.
   Trump decried the shuttle's loss of customers, which he
attributed to deteriorating service and the stormy relationship
between Eastern and its unions.
   It would take $50 million, which Eastern can't afford, to
refurbish dilapidated airplanes and terminals to attract new
customers, he said.
   ``If I can take the shuttle and turn it around, I think the deal
that I made would be an OK deal,'' Trump said, acknowledging that he
agreed to pay a high price.
   Trump insisted the deal was good for both Eastern and its
employees as well.
   ``If I were on the Eastern side, I would rush like hell to make
this deal,'' he said. ``Without this deal, I think Eastern is
finished.''
   While projecting a common touch, Trump was also combative with
union lawyers who contend that Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., is
selling the shuttle as part of a larger effort to liquidate the
financially troubled airline.
   The Air Line Pilots Association, the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers, and the Transport Workers Union of
America contend that the sale violates the Railway Labor Act because
the unions were not consulted.
   ``You think so negatively,'' Trump replied when machinists' union
attorney Joseph Guerrieri Jr. suggested that the sale would reduce
employees' protection from layoffs.
   Trump said Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo sought him out as an
investor in the shuttle earlier this year ``because he knows I have
money.
   ``He would have come to you if he thought you had money,'' Trump
told Guerrieri.
   Trump said he declined Lorenzo's initial offer, saying he would
want to operate the shuttle himself, without partners. ``Generally,
I don't have partners _ it's easier that way.''
   At several points, Trump was reminded by U.S. District Judge
Barrington D. Parker that his jocular banter was inappropriate for
the witness stand.
   ``This is a courtroom, this is not a boardroom,'' Parker said.
   The judge, however, paid tribute to Trump's abilities as a
witness and entrepreneur when he overruled objections that the real
estate developer was being badgered by union lawyers.
   ``Mr. Trump is no babe in the woods, he is no neophyte. He is a
well respected businessman of no little experience,'' Parker said.
``Mr. Trump can take care of himself.''

   The fifth Reagan-Gorbachev summit took place on the 47th
anniversary of the Japanese bombing of the U.S. military base at
Pearl Harbor, the event which catapulted the United States into
World War II and an uneasy alliance with Russia's Josef Stalin.
   Gorbachev has consolidated his power in the Kremlin, and came to
New York determined to advance the warming East-West relationship,
perhaps so he could pay more attention to economic and social
problems at home.
   Reagan is riding out the remainder of his term while Bush
organizes the administration he wants to have in place by
Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, and the dynamics of the summit were suarter
revenue rose to $1.31 billion from $927 million a
year earlier.
   The company said its net income for the quarter fell because of
amortization of goodwill and higher interest expenses related to its
1988 acquisitions of Martell SA, which makes Martell cognac, and the
Tropicana fruit juices and beverages.
   It said operating income rose 44.6 percent for the quarter to
$130.1 million fillion a year earlier.
   For the nine months, Seagram said its earnings rose 16.9 percent
to $470.5 million, or $4.91 a sharrom nearly $90 me, from $402.4 million,
or $4.20 a
share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the nine months rose 32.8 percent to $3.49 billion
from $2.63 billion a year earlier.
   The company said its earnings for the nine months reflected
improvement in its beverage operations and a higher contribution
from its 22.9 percent stake in E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co.
   Seagram has affiliates in 28 countries and makes and markets
brands that include Chivas Regal Scotch Whisky, Crown Roas conducted by

<HEAD>OMB Denies Energy Department Money for Weapons Plant Cleanup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Office of Management and Budget has turned
down a Department of Energy request for $200 million in additional
funds to pay for urgently needed reactor repairs at the troubled
Savannah River Plant, a White House official said Wednesday.
   DOE's three reactors at the plant near Aiken, S.C., have been
shut down due to safety concerns and maintenance needs. They are the
nation's only source for tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen
used in modern nuclear warheads.
   Because tritium decays at a rate of 5.5 percent a year, it needs
to be regularly replenished.
   A report issued Tuesday by the Energy Department outlined more
than 160 separate tasks for restarting the plant's K reactor. It
called for a complete overhaul of training, safety, management,
operating and inspection procedures.
   The White House official, who spoke on condition that he not be
identified, said, ``Energy came in and asked for new money to fund
some of the cleanup.''
   ``In the (fiscal 1990) budget review, what happened is that they
were told they can't have new money. You have to find the money
within your own budget, which is the same case as every federal
agency has now under the Gramm-Rudman restrictions,'' he said.
   The official added, ``It's not that it isn't a good cause and
that everyone doesn't support doing it _ it's where you get the
money from.''
   With the start of the 1990 fiscal year 10 months off, there are
no indications that OMB's rejection of the extra money means that
the work will not be done.

<HEAD>Peres Expects Coalition Talks With Likud to Reopen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres predicted
Wednesday his party would reverse itself and agree to talks with the
rival Likud bloc over forming a coalition government.
   Peres said Labor could agree to a coalition if the right-wing
Likud gives Labor an equal voice in the government, pursues a Middle
East peace pact and stops building settlements in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Last week, Labor's 110-member Executive Bureau vetoed further
negotiations with Likud, defying calls by Peres and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.
   The center-left party's 1,432 member Central Committee was to
meet Thursday to reconsider that decision. ``I estimate the proposal
will be approved,'' Peres said on Israel Television.
   Still, Likud continued efforts to try to form a narrower
coalition with right-wing and religious parties before Labor meets.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, the Likud leader, reached
agreement Wednesday on some sticking points with the National
Religious Party and the Tehiya Party, Israel radio reported.
   Under the agreement, Likud would commit the new government to
build 10 new settlements in the occupied lands and to give both
parties ministries in the new government in exchange for their
support, the radio said. Likud leaders say they hope to form a
narrow government, then invite Labor into a partnership.
   But the agreement to increase settlements in the territories
jeopardizes possible negotiations with the Labor Party.
   ``Of course I will not enter a government that will create
settlements,'' said Peres, who is Israel's foreign minister. ``Of
course I will not go to a government that has no peace process.''
   ``I propose a government with the two major parties at its
center, but I'm not ready to join like a fifth column or a comet
that only has its tail,'' he said in the television interview.
   The issue of negotiations with Likud has deeply divided Labor.
   Israel radio predicted acrimonious discussions continuing into
the night on Thursday, with the old guard of Peres and Rabin finally
triumphing over younger Labor members. The margin could be narrow,
the radio said.
   Labor leaders scheduled the Central Committee meeting after
President Chaim Herzog, a veteran Laborite, called Peres to his
office Monday to request a reopening of coalition talks. Herzog said
he had received thousands of letters demanding a joint government
and a change in Israel's election laws.
   In the Nov. 1 parliament elections, Likud won 40 seats to Labor's
39, with the other 41 seats divided among 13 smaller parties. Likud
has been asked to form a government and must get backing either from
Labor or from several of the smaller right-wing and religious
parties to do so.
   Shamir's efforts to form a narrow government have been stymied by
the stiff demands of the religious parties, which are pushing for
changes in religious legislation that could alienate secular
Israelis and non-Orthodox Jews.

<TEXT>
   Fifty-six people protesting the treatment of Jews
in the Soviet Union were arrested Wednesday when they crossed
barricades and sat in the street outside the United Nations building
during Mikhail S. Gorbachev's speech.
   They were part of a throng of chanting, flag-waving 1,000
demonstrators who massed outside the UN in an effort to remind the
Soviet leader of his various problems back home. Besides Jews, there
were supporters of dissidents in the Baltic states, Ukrainians,
Afghans and Armenians.
   The arrests were made while Gorbachev addressed the UN General
Assembly. The demonstrators, members of an organization called
Students Struggle for Soviet Jewry, were taken away in vans, issued
summonses for disorderly conduct, and released.
   ``There's a changed atmosphere, but it's far from being enough,''
said Rabbi Haskel Lookstein, a leader of the demonstration. ``We
appreciate the initial steps ... but there's much more to be done.''
He cited a need for greater freedom for Jews to practice their
religion and emigrate.
   Comptroller Harrison Goldin, one of the city's highest elected
officials, was among those who addressed the crowd.
   ``We hope that as (Gorbachev) pursues glasnost he will be equally
vigorous in implementing a fundamental human freedom: the right to
emigrate and freely practice one's religion. For Jews, that is
fundamental ... to maintain Jewish identity.''
   Franklin Smiles, a rabbinical student, was asked whether he
thought Gorbachev _ who stepped directly from his limousine to the
UN building _ even heard the demonstrators' message.
   ``It's more important that it reaches Americans'' so that they
will pressure U.S. officials to pressure their Soviet counterparts,
he replied.
   Another group of demonstrators carried large banners calling for
the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Some protesters
chanted, ``Death to Gorbachev!''
   Members of an Estonian group waved their national flag and
chanted ``One two three four, open up the iron door.'' Estonia is
part of the Soviet Union, but is in the midst of a nationalist
revival.

<TEXT>
   Belgium should not build another nuclear
power plant because it is cheaper to use energy sources such as coal
and natural gas, an Economics Ministry study said Wednesday.
   The government is to decide this week whether to build a proposed
$2.1 billion plant, said ministry spokesman Philippe Demeyer. ``At
this stage the decision could still go either way.''
   Using traditional energy sources could save the country up to
$915 million. the study says. Electricity producers, who support the
construction of what would be Belgium's eighth nuclear plant, have
said non-nuclear options would cost $2.1 billion more than atomic
power.
   Critics have underlined the possible environmental damage from
building the new plant about six miles from downtown Antwerp, near
four other nuclear units and a cluster of chemical plants.
   Belgium derives 66 percent of its energy from nuclear power and
its electricity consumption is increasing by about 3 percent a year.

   The government said Wednesday it will close a

for habitation.
   The 12-story San Yick refugee center, where 691 people have
contracted chicken pox, will be closed as soon as other
accomodations are found, said refugee coordinator Mike Hanson.
   The outbreak of chicken pox began in October, two months after
the facility opened.
   The government opened the facility to accomodate the large number
of Vietnamese who have fled to this British colony from their

<2ND_LINE>   ``This study makes clear how very large their community services</2ND_LINE>

   are, dwarfing all funds contributed to and by other voluntary
organizations for local human services,'' Independent Sector
president Brian O'Connell said in the foreward to the report. ``The
report documents that religious congregations are the primary
voluntary service providers for neighborhoods.''
   According to the survey by The Gallup Organization, nearly nine
out of 10 of the nation's 296,000 congregations had one or more
programs in human services and welfare, with a heavy focus on family
counseling activities.
   Seventy percent were involved in overseas charitable activities,
and 56 percent were involved institutional care such as hospitals,
nursing homes or hospices.
   The $19.1 billion given by congregations, mostly in the form of
collections and pledges, was in addition to the approximately $11
billion contributed by other sources to religiously affiliated
organizations such as schools, nursing homes and day care centers,
the group said.
   Of the $48.1 billion of total expenditures by congregations in
1986, $8.4 billion was donated directly to other organizations and
individuals, the study said. Of that, $5.5 billion went to
denominational organizations and charities, such as Catholic
Charities; $1.9 billion went to other charitable organizations in
the community and $1 billion was given directly to individuals.
   ``This compares to the total of financial support from all U.S.
foundations in the same year of $5.9 billion and of U.S. business
corporations of $4.5 billion, making religions a primary source of
financial grants,'' Independent Sector said.
   More than 100 denominations _ Protestant, Roman Catholic, Mormon,
Jewish, Muslim and others _ and regions were represented in the
sample.
   The survey, conducted from May 1987 through March 1988, included
telephone interviews with 4,205 local congregations and more
detailed questionnaires given to a smaller sampling.
   Details on giving by individual congregations were kept
confidential.
   O'Connell said the study was undertaken before the outbreak of
scandals involving television evangelists and was not intended to
offset the negative publicity they caused.

<HEAD>Study Says Infant Health Declined In Rural Areas in 1980s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's poorest rural areas experienced a
``dramatic reversal'' of years of progress in improving infant
health during the first half of the 1980s, a consumer research group
said Wednesday.
   Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, analyzing infant health
data from the nation's 332 poorest rural counties between 1975 and
1985, said the percentage of babies born at dangerously low weight
dropped from 9.1 percent in 1975 to 8.3 percent in 1980 before
climbing to 8.8 percent in 1985.
   In addition, the study said, the infant mortality rate in the
nation's poorest rural areas declined by only 5 percent between 1980
and 1985, after registering an 11.9 percent drop between 1975 and
1980.
   The infant mortality rate in the 332 poor rural counties was 13.6
per 1,000 live births in 1985, compared to 10.6 nationally, and the
low birthweight rate was almost 30 percent higher in those counties
than in the nation as a whole.
   The study said that if the infant mortality rate in the poor
rural areas had been as low as the national average during the
decade, there would have been between 4,000 and 6,400 fewer infant
deaths in those poor counties.
   ``This country has long had one of the highest infant mortality
rates among the world's industrialized nations,'' said Rep. Roy
Rowland, D-Ga., the only physician in Congress and the vice chairman
of the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality.
   ``It has also been apparent for some years that the rate is even
higher in economically depressed rural areas than in the country as
a whole,'' he said. ``This study confirms our worst fears.''
   Rowland, whose district includes 13 of the 332 counties in the
study, said infant health problems in rural areas have been worsened
by spending cuts under the Reagan administration for health care
programs.
   But he said the problem also stems from a decline in the number
of physicians in rural areas, from the lack of transportation
available to get pregnant women to health care centers, and from a
failure to educate poor women on the importance of pre-natal care.
   The study recommended that the federal government provide more
maternal and child health care for rural areas.
   It also called for new intiatives to expand access to food and
nutrition assistance programs and for the development of more
efficient ways to provide infant health care in impoverished rural
areas.

   NASA on Wednesday showed off a
spacecraft resembling a giant insect that will be launched toward
Venus when the space shuttle Atlantis makes its next flight.
   The probe, called Magellan, stood upright in a sterile ``white
room,'' its solar panels spread like the wings of a butterfly, as
reporters and photographers got a closeup look.
   Because of the spacecraft's susceptibility to certain
contaminants, the visitors wore white coveralls and hair covers and
were asked not to use makeup or hairspray during the hours before
the showing.
   Magellan is being groomed to be carried into space by Atlantis on
its fourth flight, scheduled to begin April 28.
   Atlantis landed at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., Tuesday at the
end of its third flight, a secret military mission. It will be
ferried back to Cape Canaveral next week atop a Boeing 747 airliner
to be readied for its next launch.
   Once the shuttle is in orbit, the five-member crew will release
Magellan and a rocket will start it on a 466-day trip to Venus.
   The probe is to settle into an orbit around Venus and obtain the
best images yet of the planet's surface with an advanced radar
system.
   ``The goal is to obtain radar images of at least 70 percent of
the planet,'' said Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist at
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
   He said the images would help scientists understand how Venus was
formed and might provide answers to the puzzling question of how
Earth and Venus evolved so differently even though at the beginning
of the solar system they were almost identical.
   Venus, Earth's closest planetary neighbor, has a surface
temperature of about 900 degrees Fahrenheit, its atmosphere is
almost entirely carbon dioxide and its atmospheric pressure is 90
times that of Earth's. It is 67.2 million miles from the sun,
compared to the Earth's 93 million miles from the sun.
   Magellan will be the first planetary probe launched from a
shuttle as well as the first U.S. planetary mission since two
Pioneer spacecraft were dispatched in 1978 to study Venus'
atmosphere.

   Soviets watching President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
speech that was televised live from the United Nations on Wednesday
praised his decision to reduce troop and tank levels in Eastern
Europe.
   But a few others grumbled that the decision was unnecessary, or
that the Soviet Union had more pressing problems.
   ``It's a really good idea to cut down the amount of troops abroad
because it will save our country some money,'' said Oleg Abramov, a
mechanic from the provincial city of Tula 150 miles south of Moscow.
   Abramov was in a crowd that watched the speech on color TV sets
in the waiting hall of Moscow's Kiev railway station.
   ``We have a big army and a great army. We can afford to bring
some of the troops home and even things out with the Americans a
bit,'' said Alexander Yermakov, a truck driver from suburban Moscow.
   Gorbachev proposed that 500,000 troops be withdrawn from Eastern
Europe and well as 10,000 tanks. He also called for a cease-fire in
Afghanistan starting Jan. 1.
   The main evening news program ``Vremya'' opened with a six-minute
report on the speech, including excerpts of meetings and other
activities. The official news agency Tass carried separate stories
on different aspects of the speech.
   There have been no official comments on Gorbachev's speech yet,
but a television commentator offered an explanation of the reaction
of U.N. delegates shown applauding Gorbachev.
   ``The professional quality of those sitting at the delegation
tables dictates restraining a display of feeling, the stormy
expression of which here is just not acceptable. But such a reaction
which you have witnessed is difficult to recall,'' the commentator
said.
   Tass quickly carried congratulatory remarks on Gorbachev's speech
from various world leaders and prominent public figures, including
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Television later interrupted regular programming with Gorbachev's
arrival at Governor's Island for a meeting with President Reagan.
   Others who watched Gorbachev's speech were more restrained in
their assessment.
   ``I like to watch Gorbachev, but I would really rather have a
look at his wife,'' said a Moscow factory worker.
   ``How could I possibly listen while waiting in line at the
grocery store,'' said another Muscovite.
   ``This is not the kind of thing we need to hear and not the sort
of thing I support,'' said an army soldier who refused to give his
name.
   Muscovites were unable to watch the speech at several traditional
spots. A huge TV screen on a building on the busy Kalinin Prospekt
remained dark throughout the speech and all the TV sets in the Orbit
electronics store were turned off.
   The viewers got a rare glimpse of New York with pictures of
Gorbachev's limousine arriving at the United Nations, a panorama of
the bustling city streets, and Reagan's warm welcome on Governor's
Island.

   Final payments totaling about $106 million are
going out to states as their share of national forest sales receipts
this year, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers said the money is in addition to
a preliminary payment of $212 million which went to the states on
Sept. 27, bringing the total for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30
to more than $318 million.
   By law, 25 percent of the revenues collected by the Agriculture
Department agency for the sale of timber and other use of national
forest resources must be returned to the states where the forests
are located. Actual receipts in fiscal 1988 totaled approximately
$1.26 billion.
   The states are required to use the funds for schools and roads.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Calls For Expanded U.N. Role In Peacekeeping, Monitoring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on
Wednesday called for a vastly expanded role for the United Nations,
from sending peacekeepers into Afghanistan to barring weapons from
outer space.
   Gorbachev also proposed a ``peace corps'' to rebuild Afghanistan,
a team of international scientists to solve environmental disasters,
giving the World Court jurisdiction in human rights cases and
U.N.-sponsored talks between debtor and creditor nations.
   The United Nations gave the Soviet Union an honorable way to
withdraw more than 100,000 Red Army troops from Afghanistan in the
Geneva Accords, which call for U.N. monitoring of a total Soviet
pullout by Feb. 15.
   ``The recent reinvigoration of its peacemaking role has again
demonstrated the United Nations' ability to assist its members in
coping with the daunting challenges of our time and working to
humanize their relations,'' Gorbachev told the General Assembly.
   Gorbachev proposed a complete cease-fire in Afghanistan effective
Jan. 1, along with ``sending to Kabul and other strategic centers of
the country a contingent of United Nations peace-keeping forces.''
   Currently, about 50 officers of the U.N. Good Office Mission to
Afghanistan and Pakistan are monitoring the Soviet troop withdrawal
and investigating complaints of violations of the Geneva Accords.
   ``We also request the secretary-general to facilitate early
implementation of the idea of holding an international conference on
the neutrality and demilitarization of Afghanistan,'' said Gorbachev.
   ``We shall continue most actively to assist in healing the wounds
of the war and ... support the proposal to create under the auspices
of the United Nations a voluntary, international Peace Corps to
assist in the revival of Afghanistan,'' he pledged.
   The world body has embarked on an 18-month, $1.166-billion
program to move Afghan refugees home and revive the shattered
agricultural economy of Afghanistan.
   Turning from war on the ground to peace in the heavens, Gorbachev
said, ``The Soviet Union is also ready to cooperate in establishing
an international space laboratory or manned orbital station designed
exclusively for monitoring the state of the environment.''
   ``All activities in outer space must rule out the appearance of
weapons there. ... There is already a strongly felt need to develop
an all-embracing regime for peaceful work in outer space. The
verification of compliance with that regime would be entrusted to a
World Space Organization,'' an idea that the Soviets have been
promoting in the United Nations for several years.
   ``We are prepared to incorporate within its system our
Krasnoyarsk radar station'' in Siberia, which the United States says
violates the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   ``Soviet scientists are prepared to receive their foreign
colleagues and discuss with them ways of converting it into an
international center for peaceful cooperation by dismantling and
refitting certain units and structures, and to provide additional
equipment. The entire system could function under the auspices of
the United Nations,'' he said.
   President Reagan has insisted on the destruction of the radar
installation.
   A major function of the space laboratory would be to keep track
of pollution, for which Gorbachev had another proposal:
   ``Let us also think about setting up within the framework of the
United Nations a center for emergency environmental assistance. Its
function would be promptly to send international groups of experts
to areas with badly deteriorating environment,'' he said.
   The Soviets have for years been promoting the concept of making
the World Court's human-rights rulings mandatory, particularly on
the five permanent members of the Security Council _ the Soviet
Union, United States, China, Britain and France.
   Currently the opinions of the court, formally called the
International Court of Justice, are now advisory.
   ``We believe that the jurisdiction of the International Court of
Justice at The Hague as regards the interpretation and
implementation of agreements on human rights should be binding on
all states,'' Gorbachev said.
   ``Our ideal is a world community of states which are based on the
rule of law and which subordinate their foreign policy activities to
law,'' he said.
   Developing nations have been crushed by debt repayment schedules
during the 1980s; the total Third World debt is over $1.2 trillion
and many nations can't even repay the interest on their loans.
   Gorbachev proposed ``limiting their official debt-servicing
payments depending on the economic performance of each of them or
granting them a long period of deferral in the repayment of a major
portion of their debt.''
   He backed the appeal of the Geneva-based U.N. Conference on Trade
and Development for reducing debts owed to commercial banks, which
are almost exclusively in Western nations.
   ``The Soviet Union favors a substantive discussion of ways to
settle the debt crisis at multilateral forums, including
consultations under the auspices of the United Nations among heads
of government of debtor and creditor countries,'' Gorbachev added.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced today the Soviet
Union will unilaterally cut its military forces by a half-million
troops and reduce its conventional arms substantially, saying the
military ``no longer can or must be an instrument of foreign
policy.''
   Gorbachev said the move comes ``without relation'' to
international negotiations that have long been stalled in Vienna.
   Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet
president said thousands of tanks, as well as troops, would be
withdrawn from Eastern European countries, as well as from Soviet
Europe, and others forces would be pulled out of Mongolia and Asia
in a major drawdown of the Soviet military machine.
   Later, after viewing the Statue of Liberty with President Reagan
and President-elect George Bush, Gorbachev was asked whether he
sought anything in return for his military cuts.
   ``In developing our relations we can work only together, so we do
hope that the United States and the Europeans will work with us and
will also take certain steps,'' Gorbachev told reporters. He did not
elaborate.
   As he and Reagan began their fifth and final summit meeting,
Gorbachev said his announcement was ``a continuation and
implementation'' of a general outline of Soviet goals that he
conceived as early as January 1986.
   Asked by reporters whether the Soviet military establishment was
resisting his plan, the Kremlin leader smiled and exclaimed, ``Nyet,
nyet, nyet.'' The Soviets announced the retirement today of their
longtime military chief of staff.
   Gorbachev said he considered today's talks with Reagan and Bush
on Governors Island to be ``not a negotiating meeting'' but a
``get-together.''
   Gorbachev's announcement came in the first address by a Soviet
leader to the U.N. in more than a quarter century. Gorbachev had
hinted Tuesday at the reduction of the Soviet military forces,
believed to number 5.6 million.
   Gorbachev also turned to the U.N. for further assistance in
helping it remove its troops from Afghanistan, a pullout suspended
amid claims that a U.N.-brokered withdrawal accord has collapsed.
The Soviet occupying force there once numbered more than 100,000.
   He called for a total ceasefire beginning Jan. 1 and a halt in
all offensive operations in the war-torn nation, which would include
attacks by the Afghan rebels.
   He also proposed an end to all arms supplies to forces on both
sides of the civil war and asked for a United Nations peace-keeping
force to oversee formation of a broad-based Afghan government.
   Echoing a proposal by Afghan leader Najib, Gorbachev asked for an
international conference to guarantee the neutrality and
demilitarization of the mountainous country on the Soviet border
where Soviet troops have been bogged down for nine years.
   In a speech that blended ponderous rhetoric with a quotation from
author John Donne, the Soviet leader said, ``The bell of every
regional conflict tolls for all of us.''
   In addition, Gorbachev said Bush will find the Soviet Union a
ready partner in continuing negotiations for a 50-percent cut in
strategic nuclear arsenals and expressed hope there would be ``no
long pauses or backtracking'' in U.S.-Soviet relations during the
transition from the Reagan to Bush administrations. Gorbachev was
meeting over lunch with Bush and Reagan at Governors Island in New
York Harbor.
   Calling for ``a period of peace,'' Gorbachev said that Cold War
politicians ``find it particularly hard to abandon old stereotypes
and past practices.'' But in an apparent reference to Reagan and
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, he said some Western
leaders ``are now drawing the appropriate conclusions.''
   Reagan, arriving at Governors Island, was asked whether the
Soviet arms move would move forward arms control talks. ``We'll have
to wait and see,'' Reagan said.
   In a speech to a hall packed with diplomats, including a solemn
Secretary of State George Shultz, Gorbachev also called for steps to
alleviate the burden of debt repayment on underdeveloped countries
and called for international steps to safeguard the environment.
   Saying he was living up to a pledge to switch from an offensive
to a defensive force structure, Gorbachev told the world body his
nation will ``maintain our country's defense capability at a level
of reasonable and reliable sufficiency'' to deter attack.
   But he said, ``The use of threat of force no longer can or must
be an instrument of foreign policy.''
   He said by 1991 the Soviets would withdraw 50,000 men and 5,000
tanks from East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. It is believed
the Soviets have 500,000 troops in that region.
   Gorbachev and his aides had long been hinting at the reduction,
but had been opposed by top Soviet generals, notably Marshal Sergei
Akhromeyev, the military chief of staff. Soviet spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov said Wednesday that Akhromeyev had retired for ``reasons
of health.''
   Gorbachev said there would be further reductions on Soviet soil
bordering Eastern Europe as well as along the Asian borders.
Gorbachev said many of the forces to be pulled out of Europe,
including six tank divisions from East Germany, Czechoslovakia and
Hungary, would be disbanded.
   In a bold stroke that nonetheless had been anticipated for some
months by Western observers, the reformist Soviet president said he
intends to convert his economy ``to an economy of disarmament'' and
would develop and publish its plans for converting its defense
plants and shifting military specialists into civilian industry.
   Gorbachev's overhaul and modernization of his country will
require a major redistribution of resources.
   His speech lasted a few minutes longer than an hour and was
applauded by the international audience. State-run radio and
television broadcast Gorbachev's address live in his home country.
   In other parts of his speech, Gorbachev:
   _ Criticized the United States for denying a visa to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat so he could address the U.N. General Assembly.
``We voice our deep regret over the incident,'' Gorbachev said.
Shultz rejected Arafat's request on the grounds that he and the
Palestine Liberation Organization sponsor terrorism.
   _ Announced that the Soviet Union will soon reform its penal
code. Soviet Jews seeking to leave his country to be re-united with
their families will be handled in a ``humane spirit,'' he said. But
he said Soviet citizens will still be denied exit visas if they have
knowledge of state secrets.
   _ Suggested that the World Court in The Hague be used as a forum
to adjudicate human rights complaints.
   _ Proposed creating an international organization that would help
Third World countries alleviate their massive debt payments. He said
the Soviet Union would be willing to enforce a 100-year moratorium
on debt repayment for some countries, and cancel debts altogether in
some cases.
   _ Proposed an international space lab devoted to environmental
protection, although he said quickly that any space mission must
``rule out the appearance of weapons'' there.
   His announcement is expected to give new momentum to long-stalled
talks on reducing Warsaw Pact and NATO conventional forces in
Central Europe and improve the climate for a summit expected next
spring between Gorbachev and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. China has
cut its own ground forces by 1 million troops in the past four
years, leaving it with about 4 million.
   Gorbachev is the first Soviet leader to address the world body
since 1960, when Nikita S. Khrushchev spent three weeks in New York
attending sessions of the General Assembly. His visit is best
remembered for an incident in which he pounded his shoe on his desk
to protest remarks by another speaker.

   More than 50 faculty members and students
have filed a complaint against two University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh
professors who used racist phrases during a Faculty Senate debate.
   Thomas Grogan, university legal counsel, said Wednesday the
university would not comment on the complaint since it deals with
personnel items and is considered confidential.
   Barbara Sniffen, a history professor, and Gerard Grzyb, a
sociology professor, used the terms ``yassir boss'' and ``house
nigger,'' respectively, during a Nov. 8 Faculty Senate debate on a
proposal by the administration that had no racial overtones.
   Both professors were suggesting that the proposal would make the
faculty slaves to the administration.
   Ms. Sniffen is president of the faculty group, and Grzyb the
president-elect.
   The complaint, received by Chancellor Edward M. Penson Dec. 1,
asked that the two be reprimanded for their comments.
   Penson must either dismiss the complaint or order a formal review
by Monday.
   ``I deeply regret the racial crisis that has occurred here, and
has damaged the senate and UW-Oshkosh,'' Ms. Sniffen said.
   Grzyb said he has taken a major step to make peace with the black
students and faculty in the community. But he wouldn't say what he
had done, until he had worked out all the details.
   ``My first responsibility is to the black community and not to
the senate,'' he said.

<HEAD>Hajek Favors Official Reconsideration of 1968 Events</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAZ, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Czechoslovak foreign minister
indirectly called Wednesday for Prague leaders to reconsider the
1968 Soviet-led invasion and hardline policies still considered
legitimate.
   Jiri Hajek arrived in Austria on Monday, on his first Western
trip in almost 20 years, to speak at a seminar organized by several
peace groups to mark international Human Rights Day on Dec. 10.
   The human rights activist traced developments since the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights emerged 40 years ago.
   ``I do not so much care about the rehabilitation of individual
people, but about whether one wants to make a clean sweep of the
events of 1968,'' he said in subsequent comments.
   Hajek referred to the invasion, the subsequent purge of a
half-million Communist Party members and the banning from public
life of thousands of dissident and other non-conformist
intellectuals, artists and politicians since then.
   The Czechoslovak leadership, headed by Communist Party chief
Milos Jakes, upholds the validity of ``Lessons to be Learned,'' a
conservative and dogmatic analysis defending the invasion, the
stationing of Soviet troops and the repressive policies pursued
under what was officially termed the program of ``normalization.''
   ``I do not challenge my homeland's leadership on the right to
recognize mistakes and carry out changes,'' Hajek said.
   ``The most important thing is the re-emergence and reawakening of
the civil society,'' said Hajek, 75, a signatory to the Charter 77
human rights manifesto.
   ``Modernization of the economy has the highest priority in
Czechoslovakia, but that is not possible without a democratization
of society,'' said Hajek, who has refrained from criticizing the
Prague establishment.

<HEAD>Study Says Injections Of Malaria Drug Are Safe</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Release at 6 p.m. EST</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Injections of a drug that has been the mainstay of
malaria treatment are safe, despite recent concerns about the safety
of the injected form, according to a new report.
   Tests conducted on 58 children with severe malaria in Gambia
showed ``no reason to abandon'' injections of the drug called
chloroquine, according to a report in Thursday's New England Journal
of Medicine.
   The drug, the world's most widely prescribed malaria medicine, is
an important medicine in poor parts of the world where malaria is
common because it is cheap, widely available, well tolerated and
cures the disease quickly.
   The drug is used in both pill and injection form to treat and
prevent the disease, which kills an estimated 2 million to 3 million
people annually.
   Recently, a World Health Organization report raised toxicity
concerns about the safety of the injected form of the drug in
patients who cannot take chloroquine pills because of coma or
vomiting.
   In the recent study, Dr. Nicholas J. White of the Bangkok
Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Thailand tested seven different
treatment regimens in 58 children with severe malaria in Gambia.
   They found that continuous intravenous infusions of the drug over
30 hours worked well.

<HEAD>Right-Wing Councilor Says State Broadcasting Network Broke Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A right-wing town council
leader Wednesday filed complaints accusing state radio of violating
emergency laws by reporting on a black boycott protesting the
council's resegregation campaign.
   The regulations, often disregarded by local and foreign
journalists, outlaw calls for boycotts and prohibit news reports
about their extent.
   Blacks living near the industrial town of Boksburg, east of
Johannesburg, launched a boycott of white-owned stores last week to
protest the Conservative Party-controlled town council's decision to
resegregate public facilities that had been opened to all races in
recent years.
   The governing National Party, which drafted South Africa's
segregation laws during 40 years in power, has joined in the
widespread condemnation of the Conservative Party move even though
councils under Nationalist control still maintain some whites-only
facilities.
   The state-controlled South African Broadcasting Corp., which
generally gives scant coverage to anti-government protests, has
reported extensively on the Boksburg controversy and has mentioned
the boycott.
   Complaints against the network were lodged by Gideon Fourie,
chairman of the Boksburg council's management committee. He filed
similar complaints against Beeld, a pro-government daily newspaper,
and against the Save Boksburg Committee, led by business leaders
seeking to force the council to reverse its racist decision.
   Ferdi Hartzenberg, deputy leader of the Conservative Party, said
the ``obvious unwillingness or inability of the government'' to deal
with the boycotts ``gives the impression that it covertly supports
the actions.''
   Hartzenberg said Boksburg's Conservative Mayor Beyers de Klerk
has filed complaints accusing the Natal Building Society of
intimidation because the savings-and-loan association closed its
Boksburg agency in response to the segregation controversy.
   The Conservative Party, which depicts the government's limited
reforms as capitulation to the black majority, took control of
dozens of town councils in nationwide local elections Oct. 26. A few
of these councils have followed Boksburg's lead by resegregating
amenities while others have said such moves were unnecessary because
the Nationalist-controlled councils they ousted had not integrated
any amenities.
   In Carletonville, a mining town where Conservatives control the
council, councilors decided Tuesday to drop consideration of a
nighttime curfew for blacks.

<HEAD>Media Lawyer Says No Right to Privacy Over Criminal Records</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, studying the FBI's power to
keep criminal records secret, was told Wednesday that individuals
have no privacy right to conceal records of arrests and convictions.
   Kevin T. Baine, representing a CBS News reporter and the
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, conceded that
information about old arrests that did not lead to convictions could
paint an unfair picture about someone.
   But that ``doesn't make the information private,'' Baine said.
   Roy T. Englert, a Justice Department lawyer who argued the Reagan
administration position, said the FBI should be allowed to exclude
so-called ``rap sheets'' from disclosure under the Freedom of
Information Act.
   ``There is a balancing between the public interest and privacy
rights,'' Englert said.
   He chose an example from ``Les Miserables,'' a famous work of
French literature and now a hit Broadway musical, to underscore his
point.
   Jean Valjean, the hero of the work, ``may be entitled to privacy
for his conviction for stealing bread'' years earlier, Englert said.
   The justices are studying the administration's bid to scuttle an
FOIA lawsuit by CBS News reporter Robert Schakne and the Reporters
Committee.
   Schakne in 1978 sought all FBI records of the arrests,
indictments and court dispositions of any charges against four
brothers, three of whom were identified as associates of reputed
Pennsylvania crime boss Russell Bufalino.
   Schakne sought the FBI records on William, Phillip, Samuel and
Charles Medico.
   He was trying to determine if they had criminal records because
their firm, Medico Industries Inc., had received lucrative defense
contracts with the help of former Rep. Daniel J. Flood, D-Pa.
   Flood pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 1980 and was placed on
probation in connection with charges he accepted $50,000 in bribes.
   The Reporters Committee later filed a request similar to
Schakne's for the FBI records.
   The FBI maintains rap sheets on some 25 million Americans,
compiling arrest and conviction records supplied by federal, state
and local law enforcement agencies.
   The Pennsylvania Crime Commission in 1980 identified Phillip,
Angelo and William Medico as members of the Bufalino crime family.
The commission said Bufalino regularly visited the Medico family
business in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., over a 20-year period.
   The FBI released information about the late William Medico; said
it had no records on Phillip and Samuel, also deceased; and refused
to release its file on Charles Medico on grounds it would violate
his privacy rights.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last year that the
1966 FOIA law does not exempt such records from disclosure.
   Some justices expressed skepticism Wednesday over the
administration's bid to reverse the appeals court decision.
   ``There is an expectation of privacy that a public record will
not be discovered?'' Justice Antonin Scalia asked Englert.
   ``I thought the underpinning of the First Amendment is that the
government will not decide what information is more useful to the
citizenry,'' Scalia said. ``I'm not inclined (for the government) to
make that determination.''
   The court is expected to announce its decision in the case by
July.
   The case is U.S. Department of Justice vs. Reporters Committee,
87-1379.

<TEXT>
   Conditions at Walata prison have
improved considerably since four political prisoners died of
ill-treatment, surviving detainees told reporters and human rights
officials.
   International attention focused last month on this harsh
penitentiary 800 miles southeast of the capital, Nouakchott, when
London-based human rights organization Amnesty International
reported the deaths and poor conditions.
   Since then, the prison chief and an assistant have been arrested
and the government has ordered an investigation.
   ``The army officer who was in charge of the prison told us we
were sent here to die,'' said Mamadou Bocar Ly, 38, a former
interior minister jailed since October 1987 for attempting a coup.
   ``He always repeated: `I can kill you and say you died of
diarrhea,''' Ly told reporters allowed to visit the prison at the
weekend with Abdelhamid Ould Ghaly, president of the Mauritanian
League of Human Rights.
   The 32 men imprisoned in this former French fortress constitute
the military wing of the Black Mauritanian Liberation Forces who
last year tried to overthrow the military government of President
Muawiya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, who himself seized power in a bloodless
1984 coup.
   In a Nov. 21 report, Amnesty International said the government
had confirmed the deaths of four political prisoners _ writer Tene
Youssouf Gueye, policeman Ba Alassane Oumar, Lt. Abdoul Ghoudouss
Ba, and former Health Minister Djigo Tafsirou.
   The report said prisoners at Walata, built in the 1930s and
isolated in the middle of the desert, live under ``particularly
harsh'' conditions, suffering from malnutrition and receiving no
medical care. Extreme temperatures aggravated the situation.
   Amnesty also said unofficial reports spoke of the deaths of three
others _ Ly, journalist Ibrahim Sarr and engineer Amadou Moktar Sow.
Those three, however, were interviewed by reporters on the trip to
Walata.
   All prisoners they saw appeared in good health. Officials said
families of the prisoners would be allowed to visit soon.
   After the deaths, the government promised to take action.
Thirty-one civilian prisoners were transferred to Ayoun el-Atrouss,
185 miles west of here.
   The civilians have been imprisoned since 1986 for distributing
``The Black Mauritanian Manifesto,'' a document accusing the
government of racism.
   This West African nation is dominated by people of Arab Berber
origin who outnumber blacks 4-1. Blacks have become increasingly
vocal in opposing the Arabs.
   According to prison inmates, the villain at Walata was a Lt.
Ghaly, who not only imposed harsh conditions of forced labor and
poor food but regularly mistreated prisoners.
   ``We ate only rice and water for nine months,'' said Abdoullay
Milikel. ``There have been improvements since last May when (Ghaly)
was removed.''
   The real turning point, prisoners say, was when Interior Minister
Gibril Ould Abdallahy visited and met detainees.
   Mauritanian officials said appropriate measures have been taken
against those involved.
   The human rights leader said he was satisfied with the current
situation of the detainees, but he urged Mauritanian authorities to
impose heavy punishment on those who ill-treated prisoners.

<TEXT>
   A Jordanian soldier who deserted his unit to
plan an attack on Israel in support of the Palestinian uprising was
sentenced to 20 years in prison Wednesday.
   Riyad Musa Abu Higa was arrested May 18 after he infiltrated
Israel from Jordan near the northern kibbutz of Kfar Ruppin, the
army prosecutor, Capt. Reuven Wolf, told a military court in Lod.
   Wolf gave no details of Higa's planned attack.
   He described the 18-year-old Jordanian soldier as a Moslem
fundamentalist who believed he would go to paradise if he died in an
anti-Israeli assault. He said the Jordanian soldier had bought a
revolver so he would not have to use his army rifle and implicate
his unit.
   The soldier had convinced two others in his unit to participate
in the attack, but they abandoned him in Israel and returned to
Jordan.
   When Israeli troops saw him, Higa fired in the air and they shot
back, wounding and capturing him, Wolf said.
   He said Higa had planned the attack to demonstrate his solidarity
with the year-long Palestinian revolt in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   During the trial, Higa refused to recognize the court and would
not rise when the judges entered.

   Authorities tested eight bottles of
Coca-Cola on Wednesday for traces of a deadly and outlawed rat
killer blamed for poisoning three family members, leaving one
comatose.
   Investigators were unsure whether the poisoning was accidental.
   ``We won't know until we hear back from the FBI lab,'' said Steve
Hulsey, Polk County sheriff's spokesman. Lab results were not
expected before Friday.
   Authorities also made plans to inspect a Tampa plant where the
Coca-Cola was bottled, said Rob Martin, a company spokesman.
   High concentrations of thallium sulfate, a rat poison and toxic
insecticide banned from general use in 1965, were found in four
empty 16 oz. bottles of Coca-Cola at the Polk County home of Peggy
Carr, police said.
   Mrs. Carr, 41, remained in critical condition at Winter Haven
Hospital, unresponsive and on a respirator. She was admitted Oct.
31, Hulsey said. Stepson Travis Carr, 16, was stable, and Mrs.
Carr's son, Duane Dubberly, 16, was released Friday.
   It was unclear where the family bought the soda or when it was
consumed.
   Martin said there have been no other reports of poisoning related
to Coca-Cola.
   ``We do not have any evidence it occurred in the bottling
plant,'' he said.
   The four bottles were part of a lot of nearly 200,000 shipped to
Central Florida markets six weeks ago. Authorities were testing the
four empty bottles and four others that were full.
   ``We believe the rest of the lot is safe, but we want local,
state and health authorities to draw the conclusions,'' Martin said.
   Earlier this week, samples of the batch in question were tested a
second time and no traces of thallium sulfate were found, Martin
said.
   Dr. Sven Normann, director of the Florida Poison Information
Center, said thallium sulfate can be found in the form of a crystal
powder or a paste which dissolves in water. One gram of the chemical
is considered a fatal dose.

   The organizers of a lottery may have
to give away 36 cars instead of the planned six because too many
winning tickets were printed, the sponsor said.
   Philip Chaubert, spokesman for the Distributa company, said each
person with the winning number, 22, who claims the prize will be
awarded a car worth about $10,000.
   ``We will honor the winners,'' he said.
   The deadline for claiming the prizes is next week, Chaubert said.

inhabitants, already has three winners, he said.
   The company sponsored the event for two store chains that control

   A thief who swiped a Cadillac apparently
had a change of heart after discovering a 7-day-old baby in the back
seat.
   The infant, Jarell Farmer, was wrapped in a blanket in the back
when the thief hopped in Tuesday night and sped away from a San Jose
gas station. The car was found about 45 minutes later, with the
unharmed infant inside, three blocks from police headquarters.
   ``As soon as he heard the baby crying, I'm sure (the thief)
pulled over,'' said police Capt. Bill Lansdowne.
   An anonymous tipster, who police suspect was the thief, phoned
police to report the location of the car where he said he heard a
baby crying.
   Police then reunited the baby with his mother, Erlinda Farmer.
   The incident began about 6 p.m. when Rufus Love, the car's owner
and a friend of Ms. Farmer, stopped at the gas station for a pack of
cigarettes.
   Love left the car _ engine running and the driver's door open _
and walked 15 feet to the cashier's window. Love was counting change
when he heard the car door slam and saw it speed off, according to
police and witnesses.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced before a global
audience today that he was cutting the size of the Red Army and
reducing Soviet forces in East Europe, then met with Ronald Reagan
and George Bush at a lunch that closed one chapter in U.S.-Soviet
relations and opened another.
   Looking toward the Bush presidency, Gorbachev told the United
Nations General Assembly that he wanted to work with the new
American president to make 1989 ``a decisive year.'' He said he was
ready to move toward a 50 percent slash in the superpowers'
stockpiles of nuclear bombers, submarines and missiles and the
elimination of chemical weapons.
   Reagan, meeting Gorbachev for the fifth time in a relationship
that has become increasingly mellow, welcomed the Soviet leader's
initiatives.
   ``It was not a proposal, it was a decision,'' Reagan said while
seated at the luncheon table at Admiral's House on Governors Island,
within sight of the Statue of Liberty.
   ``Naturally, I heartily approve,'' Reagan said.
   He said the United States would stand ready to reduce the number
of troops in the armies of te Western alliance as long as ``this
left us with a superiority.''
   After Reagan boarded Air Force One for Washington, Secretary of
State George P. Shultz told a news conference that the president
found Gorbachev's speech, with its unilateral decision to reduce
Soviet forces, ``constructive and important.''
   As for the lunch, said Shultz, the conversation was direct, open,
informal and characterized by ``lots of humor.'' Somehow, he said,
the subject came up and Reagan chatted with Gorbachev about the
beneficial effects of riding horses.
   Shultz said there was discussion of the possibility of a
Gorbachev-Bush summit, and although no immediate plans were made for
one, ``obviously there will be one at some appropriate moment.''
   A more thorough response to Gorbachev's troop-cutting proposal
could come tonight when Reagan returns to Washington to address the
American Enterprise Institute or on Thursday at the last Reagan
White House news conference.
   After lunch the three leaders rode in a long motorcade to a point
on the island that offered a handsome view of the Statue of Liberty
and of the skyline of lower Manhattan. They turned from one view to
another for a few minutes, making small talk with the help of an
interpreter. They wore overcoats.
   Reagan, asked his view of the meeting, said, ``Read our smiles.''
   Gorbachev, answering reporters' questions, stressed a need for
cooperation.
   ``In developing our relations we can work only together so we do
hope that the United States and the Europeans will work with us and
will also take certain steps,'' he said.
   Like his hosts, he appeared relaxed and in good humor.
   Before lunch, Gorbachev was asked whether he was getting
resistance from the Soviet military establishment to his decision to
reduce by about 10 percent the size of the 5.6 million Red Army. He
replied with a smile, in Russian: ``Nyet, nyet, nyet.''
   While the three leaders lunched, their wives, Nancy Reagan,
Barbara Bush and Raisa Gorbachev, joined the wives of other
diplomats and a number of other prominent women at a meal elsewhere.
The hostess was Marcela Perez de Cuellar, wife of the U.N.
general-secretary.
   ``I am happy to be in the city you call the Big Apple,'' Mrs.
Gorbachev said after stepping from a limousine to attend the
luncheon. She said she liked America.
   Gorbachev, belitting military power as a solution to
international tensions, told the United Nations General Assembly
that tens of thousands of tanks, as well as troops, would be
withdrawn from Eastern European countries, and other forces would be
pulled from Mongolia and Asia in a reduction in size of the Soviet
military machine.
   And he called for a Jan. 1 ceasefire in Afghanistan, for the
creation of a U.N. force to keep the peace there, for the formation
of a broad-based Afghan government and for an end to all arms
shipments to either side in that country's war. The United States
has been aiding anti-communist fighters in that war.
   As Gorbachev arrived, about 1,000 demonstrators waved flags and
chanted, demanding freedom for Soviet Jews. Police arrested 58.
Another thousand Eastern European emigres demonstrated nearby. A
group of Ukrainian emigres, many of them elderly, waved Ukrainian
flags. Members of an Estonian group waved their national flag and
chanted ``One two three four, open up the iron door.''
   While Gorbachev was spelling out his actions and his ideas,
Reagan and Bush flew separately to New York to have lunch with him.
   Said Gorbachev, ``If we score any points, we can do it only
together. If we try to score points alone, nothing good will
happen.''
   Bush let Reagan do the speaking.
   He said that there have been no meaningful negotiations on
conventional-force reductions and that the Soviet leader's proposal
``is a unilateral action on their part.''
   Speaking forcefully at the U.N. for a bit more than an hour, the
Soviet leader paraphrased the English poet John Donne _ by way of
Ernest Hemingway _ the Soviet leader said, ``The bell of every
regional conflict tolls for all of us.''
   Gorbachev criticized the Reagan administration on one action _
its decision to deny a visa to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat so
he could address the U.N. from the same podium he was using.
   The General Assembly voted to hold a session in Geneva so Arafat
could make his speech. Only Israel supported the U.S. action, taken
on grounds that Arafat and his Palestine Liberation Organization
sponsor terrorism. ``We voice our deep regret over the incident,''
said Gorbachev.
   On yet another front, Gorbachev pledged that Jews seeking to
leave his country to be re-united with their families will be
treated in a ``humane spirit.'' But he said Soviet citizens will
still be denied exit visas if they have knowledge of state secrets.
   Worldwide, he said, military force no longer ``can or must be an
instrument of foreign policy.''
   ``It is now quite clear that building up military power makes no
country omnipotent,'' Gorbachev declared. ``What's more, one-sided
reliance on military power ultimately weakens other components of
national security.''
   ``Red Alert: City Braces for Gorby Gridlock,'' screamed the
front-page headline of the New York Post.
   Gorbachev's visit to New York and the United Nations was the
first by a Soviet leader since 1960, when an irate Nikita S.
Khrushchev punctuated his rhetorical points by pounding his shoe on

   A unilateral Soviet troop reduction would begin to redress what
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization describes as a more than 2-1
Warsaw Bloc edge in conventional arms in Europe, and provide
momentum to long stalled talks on reducing forces on both sides. It
could also boost Gorbachev's image in Western Europe.

   A state trooper killed a sheriff's
deputy after the woman allegedly made threatening telephone calls
and fired shots at law officers, police said Wednesday.
   Elizabeth Laperouse, 22, was killed Tuesday night after pointing
a gun at officers following a chase that ended near Breaux Bridge,
50 miles west of Baton Rouge, State Police Lt. Ronnie Jones said.
   Investigators were told Laperouse, a dispatcher with the St.
Martin Parish Sheriff's office since June 1987, ``was acting
somewhat irrationally'' when she came to work Tuesday, Jones said.
``I think the words they used were `stressed out.'''
   Laperouse was told to go home, and her pistol was taken away. But
she apparently visited a friend and got another weapon, Jones said.
   Later Tuesday, according to Jones, a woman called State Police
Troop I headquarters in Lafayette threatening ``to shoot the first
trooper who comes out of the building.''
   Trooper Chet Robichaux and a member of the Scott police
department then walked out of the building, and three shots were
fired at them, Jones said.
   The shots missed, and the officers saw a woman jump into a red
car and speed away. About an hour later, a caller asked police at
Troop I, ``Did you hear the shots?'' Jones said.
   ``I'll be on I-10 in St. Martin Parish traveling east, and I dare
any trooper to try to stop me,'' Jones quoted the caller as saying.
   Robichaux spotted the red car, and he and two other troopers
pursued it to near the Atchafalaya Swamp, Jones said.
   Laperouse jumped from her car and pointed her pistol at the
troopers, he said.
   ``After being told to drop her weapon, she began to make
offensive moves, and two shots were fired, one striking her in the
head,'' Jones said. Investigators determined that State Police acted
properly, he said.

<HEAD>Former President Ford Urges Budget Process Changes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Ford on Wednesday lobbied
congressional leaders to reform their budget procedures to help
combat the federal deficit and ensure a strong economy.
   ``The budget process is in shambles,'' said Ford, who had
breakfast and lunch with congressional leaders concerned with budget
matters.
   The former president appeared at a press conference with former
Congressional Budget Office director Rudolph G. Penner and political
scientist Alan J. Abramson, two Urban Institute scholars who have
written a new book on budget reform. Ford wrote the foreword for the
book.
   ``I'm concerned that unless you do something to correct the
process, there is no way to get the White House and Congress to
achieve the (deficit reduction) results for a healthy economy,'' the
former president said.
   Among the book's suggestions is giving the president more sway
over budget decisions, including the power to veto the congressional
resolutions that guide the drafting of spending and tax bills.
   It also calls for giving the president more power to cancel
spending already approved by Congress.
   Currently, the president proposes cuts but Congress can stop them
by ignorning them. The authors propose requiring Congress to vote to
block the president's proposals.
   The book also calls for making the budget process less prone to
political tampering, including the use of an outside board of
experts to make economic forecasts.
   Ford had breakfast with House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas,
Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., Minority Leader Bob
Michel, R-Ill., incoming House budget chairman Leon Panetta,
D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole.
   He later lunched with Senate budget writers, including incoming
budget committee chairman James R. Sasser, D-Tenn., and the senior
Republican on the panel, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico.
   Ford and another former president, Jimmy Carter, have together
proposed steps for reducing the federal deficit including some new
taxes.

   Bavarian Prince Hubertus Fugger plans to
slowly renovate the 1,100-acre Barnsley Gardens estate, and
eventually may install a 70-acre lake and a museum.
   Fugger bought the northern Georgia estate through representatives
in an Atlanta-based company, Stonewall Limited Partnership, for
$1.35 million earlier this year, according to records at the Fulton
County Tax Assessor's office.
   He said in a telephone interview from Bavaria that his son also
has high hopes for the property.
   ``I brought my 8-year-old son along the last time I visited. He's
a nature-loving little guy, and when he saw the property he told me
he wanted to build a cabin out there and have a pickup to drive
around,'' Fugger told the Rome News-Tribune in a telephone interview
from Bavaria on Monday.
   ``It's a kid's dream and I do understand it very much because
it's a super place,'' he said.
   The property originally was developed to be the home of Godfrey
Barnsley, who in 1844 was a wealthy English cotton buyer.

   Mandela, leader of the outlawed African National Congress, has
been in prison since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for
sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-dominated government.
The ANC is the largest guerrilla organization fighting the
government and its apartheid policy of racial segregation.
   The transfer of Mandela, made without any advance warning,
appears part of a phased release. The government has said Mandela
will have greater access to his family and visitors after he was
moved from the hospital.
   But no details about the conditions of his stay at the prison
farm were immediately available.
   Mandela, the country's best known black leader, was hospitalized
in August and has been in the Constantiaburg Clinic since Aug. 31.
His doctors said recently that his health was good and that he was
exercising regularly.
   The government recently has released colleagues of Mandela,
fueling speculation that Mandela could be freed shortly.
   Late last month, authorities released Harry Gwala, a longtime
member of the ANC, and Zeph Mothopeng, president of the
Pan-Africanist Congress, another outlawed guerrilla group.
   The government also has released several prominent detainees in
recent days in an apparent attempt to reduce international and
domestic pressure.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Lack of Experience No Problem for Mrs. Hills, Danforth Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney Carla Hills shapes up as an good
choice for the nation's chief trade negotiator despite her lack of
experience in that field, a senator active in trade issues said
Wednesday.
   ``What I want is someone who is a tough negotiator and does not
come to the job with a prefabricated philosophy,'' Sen. John C.
Danforth, R-Mo., said in an interview. He said that described Mrs.
Hills.
   Danforth scoffed at the notion that Mrs. Hills, who was secretary
of housing and urban development in the Ford administration, might
be hampered in the post of U.S. trade representative by her lack of
trade experience.
   President-elect George Bush announced his selection of Mrs. Hills
on Tuesday.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter is wrapping up three
years in the job in which President Reagan vetoed three trade bills
despite congressional clamor over record deficits in global markets.
Reagan finally signed a wide-ranging, 1,000-page bill co-sponsored
by Danforth this year.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, another
co-sponsor, said Tuesday that Mrs. Hills is ``a very able person''
but added a reservation.
   ``I had hoped, frankly, that we'd have someone from the business
world who had extensive international experience in trade,'' Bentsen
said.
   Danforth, who had lunch with Mrs. Hills on Wednesday, noted that
most previous trade representatives came to the post with trade
experience but that Mrs. Hills had proven herself as a Cabinet
member.
   ``My impression is that she is a very able person with a very
keen mind and that she's energetic and she certainly has a lot of
experience in Washington,'' Danforth said.
   He declined to speculate on whether she would be able to prevail
in a policy dispute with Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker
III, who as treasury secretary often was the Reagan administration's
guiding hand on trade.
   ``I think it remains to be seen what the trade policy of the new
administration will be and who the key players are,'' Danforth said.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., said he ``would imagine that
Secretary Baker is going to have a lot to do with trade as he did
when he was secretary of the treasury.''
   ``He has a deep interest in it and a high degree of skill at
it,'' said Gibbons, who chairs the House Ways and Means trade
subcommittee. He said, however, that Mrs. Hills might well prove
effective in her job.
   ``You have to have one of two things to be a good trade
representative,'' Gibbons said. ``You either have to have a high
degree of technical skill and be a good bargainer or you have to
have the ear of the president.''
   ``I imagine that Hills has the president's ear,'' he said. ``I
say that because her appointment came early in this and because I
think George Bush listens to her. At least that is what I'm told.''
   He said that one of the best trade representatives was Democratic
attorney Robert Strauss, ``and he didn't know a thing about it when
he walked into the job, but Jimmy Carter would listen to him and
that's what it takes.''

<HEAD>Deficit Commission Told of Economic Effects of Deficit Cutting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Economic Commission, trying to
break the seven-year deadlock over huge budget deficits, was told
Wednesday that it matters little to overall economic performance
whether the deficit reduction comes from spending cuts or tax
increases.
   The high-level advisory panel received a study prepared by the
Congressional Budget Office which showed that a full-scale assault
on the budget deficit will not cause a recession as long as the
Federal Reserve helps out by lowering interest rates to offset the
reduced federal spending.
   The CBO report rejected arguments often raised by critics that
the current economic recovery could be thrown into a recession if
the budget deficit is brought down too rapidly or if politicians
rely too heavily on tax increases to close the gap between revenues
and spending.
   Commission Co-chairmen Robert Strauss and Drew Lewis said they
believed the CBO report showed that the commission had wide leeway
from an economic standpoint in selecting a mix of spending cuts and
tax increases to close the budget gap.
   But the two men said the economic models did not take into
account the political realities of crafting a package acceptable to
Congress and President-elect George Bush, who has vowed to reject
any new taxes.
   ``We are right where we were at first. The problem is 10 percent
economic and 90 percent political,'' Lewis said.
   The deficit panel was created by Congress a year ago to provide
advice to Congress and the president-elect on ways to eliminate the
federal budget deficit, which climbed to $155.1 billion in the
fiscal year which ended on Sept. 30.
   The CBO ran four types of deficit reduction efforts through
computer simulations of the U.S. economy to see what the impact
would be.
   All of the options would achieve deficit cuts of $120 billion to
$130 billion by 1994 but would arrive at that goal in different
ways. One option got all of the reductions from domestic programs,
exempting Social Security and defense from any cuts. This proposal
also ruled out any tax increases.
   At the other extreme, a fourth proposal got half of its deficit
savings from cuts in defense, Social Security and other entitlement
programs and other domestic programs and the other half from higher
taxes.
   Fred Ribe, assistant director for fiscal analysis for the CBO,
said that the various computer models showed little difference on
economic growth regardless of the mix of spending cuts and tax
increases which were used.
   He said that all of the models assumed that the loss of economic
stimulus from the various combinations of reduced government
spending and higher taxes would be offset by a more stimulative
policy on the part of the Federal Reserve.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has indicated that the
central bank would be willing to pursue a looser monetary policy,
pushing interest rates lower, if Congress cooperated by reducing the
borrowing demands of the federal government.
   Ribe said that if the Fed did not keep its part of the bargain,
the economic models forecast that economic growth, as measured by
the gross national product, would be 1 percentage point lower than
it otherwise would be over the next five years.
   The CBO projections used economic computer models developed by
Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass., consulting firm; Washington
University in St. Louis and Yale professor Ray Fair.
   The revenue options ranged from no increases in taxes to a
package of tax hikes on personal income and increases in taxes for
energy, beer, wine and cigarettes.
   The commission's Wednesday hearing was scheduled to be the last
public meeting for the panel this year. The panel had planned to
hold a closed-door session next Monday to give the 12 members an
opportunity to discuss various deficit cutting options.
   Several news organizations have gone to court in an effort to
force that meeting to be opened to the public. U.S. District Judge
Joyce Hens Green heard arguments on the dispute Wednesday and
indicated she would issue a ruling later this week.

   Here, at a glance, are the major developments in
Soviet president Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit Wednesday to New York:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GORBACHEV SPEECH AT UNITED NATIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev announced the Soviet Union will unilaterally cut its
military forces by a half-million troops and reduce its conventional
arms, saying the military ``no longer can or must be an instrument
of foreign policy.''
   Gorbachev also called for a total cease-fire in Afghanistan
beginning Jan. 1, proposed ending arms supplies to both sides, and
asked for a United Nations peace-keeping force to oversee formation
of a broad-based Afghan government.
   In other parts of his hour-long speech, Gorbachev spoke about
third world debt, the global environment, human rights, and the U.S.
denial of a visa for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REAGAN-GORBACHEV-BUSH MEETING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan welcomed the Soviet leader's initiatives, saying
the proposal for Soviet conventional-force reductions ``is a
unilateral action on their part.''
   Reagan, asked his view of the meeting, said, ``Read our smiles.''
   Gorbachev said, ``In developing our relations we can work only
together so we do hope that the United States and the Europeans will
work with us and will also take certain steps.''
   After lunch on Governors Island, the two leaders and
President-elect Bush rode to a point on the island offering a
handsome view of the Statue of Liberty and lower Manhattan.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOVIET-AKHROMEYEV</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Soviet foreign ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov denied
reports that the chief of the Soviet General Staff resigned in
protest over Gorbachev's troop cutback plan, saying Marshal Sergei
Akhromeyev stepped down for ``health reasons.''
   Akhromeyev and other top Soviet generals reportedly argued that
the cuts should be done simultaneously with reductions by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Gorbachev, asked whether he was getting resistance from the
military establishment, replied with a smile: ``Nyet, nyet, nyet.''

   Fifty-six people protesting the treatment of Jews in the Soviet
Union were arrested when they crossed barricades outside the United
Nations building during Gorbachev's speech. The demonstrators were
taken away in vans, issued summonses for disorderly conduct, and
released. They were part of a throng of 1,000 demonstrators massed
outside the UN.

   The three leaders' wives, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Raisa
Gorbachev, joined hostess Marcela Perez de Cuellar, wife of the U.N.
general-secretary and 20 New York socialites for lunch at her East
Side home.
   ``I am happy to be in the city you call the Big Apple,'' Mrs.
Gorbachev said.
   The Soviet first lady's itinerary Wednesday also included a visit
to the Estee Lauder cosmetic headquarters and an tour by car of
Manhattan with her husband.

<HEAD>BUSH-GORBACHEV</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush stuck to his plan to attend the
Gorbachev-Reagan meeting only in his role as vice president,
withholding any public assessment of Moscow's new troop cutback plan.
   When Reagan greeted Gorbachev on the steps of Admiral's House on
Governors Island, Bush remained inside the building, allowing the
two leaders to pose for pictures together. Bush then stepped outside
and joined Reagan and Gorbachev, shaking hands with the Soviet
leader.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Farmers Home Administration said Wednesday
that some of the 83,480 loan delinquencies targeted last month for
official collection had already been settled by the time notices
were sent out.
   Moreover, many state FmHA offices have been reporting far fewer
delinquencies than the Agriculture Department agency listed on Nov.
25 when it finished sending out the notices.
   Agency spokesman Joe O'Neill said the 83,480 loan delinquencies
reported last month represented ``everybody who owed money'' and
were behind in their payments to FmHA.
   In all, more than $8 billion in overdue loans is involved. The
notices give a delinquent borrower 45 days to fill out forms showing
how the debt will be settled.
   O'Neill said in an interview that lists of 83,490 delinquent
loans were sent to county FmHA offices so local officials could weed
out those who had already made arrangements to settle their debt, or
for some other reason were not slated to get the notices.
   As a result, several thousand borrowers were pared from the
tally, he said. Those remaining were mailed notices by certified
mail over a 10-day period beginning on Nov. 15.
   ``No, indeed, we did not sent out that many,'' O'Neill said.
``It's probably closer to 80,000, somewhere in there.''
   Congress ordered FmHA in the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 to
revise its lending practices and to come up with ways of handling
long-overdue debt owed by thousands of farmers. One of the important
features is a debt write-down or foregiveness provision, which took
effect last month.
   The purpose of the notices is to give tardy payers an opportunity
to let FmHA know how they want to handle their debt under the new
law. If a farmer does not respond within the 45-day period after
receiving the notice, the agency can begin collection proceedings,
including foreclosure and forced liquidation.
   O'Neill said another point of misunderstanding is the manner in
which local FmHA offices have been carrying some of the borrowers on
agency books. For example, he said, some offices may not be
including those whose overdue accounts have been ``accelerated,'' or
put into the foreclosure or forced-sale pipeline.
   The 1987 law also changed the definition of a borrower to include
anyone who owes FmHA money. So all those past-due loans in
acceleration _ and even those where the borrower is no longer
farming _ are included in the list of delinquencies.
   ``Anytime you start playing with numbers, it's difficult at
best,'' O'Neill said.

<HEAD>Sorority Files Complaint Over Nude Panty Raid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sorority sisters whose house was raided
by nude fraternity members filed a criminal complaint Wednesday
saying the prank was frightening at a time when several campus-area
rapes remain unsolved.
   ``Fraternities frequently pull pranks on sororities,'' said
Michele Knapp, president of the 117-member Gamma Phi Beta chapter.
``But this went too far. Quite frankly, the women were petrified
hearing strange men pounding on their doors _ especially since there
has been a rash of rapes on campus recently.''
   Police say they believe two men are responsible for as many as 14
rapes on and near the Ann Arbor campus since September 1987. The
last rape reported near the campus was Oct. 18, Sgt. Tom Caldwell
said. Most of the assaults, for which no arrests have been made,
occurred inside buildings.
   The panty raid occurred in the early morning of Nov. 29, Knapp
said. Three or four nude fraternity members entered several
bedrooms, stole lingerie and asked girls to sign their posteriors.
   ``I was stunned and dazed,'' said Amy Long, 20, of Long Island,
N.Y. ``I could smell the alcohol on him and he kept asking me to
autograph his rear _ except he used more vulgar language.''
   Long said it may sound like a prank, ``but it is more serious
when you consider the invasion of privacy. They had no right to come
into my room and go through my personal things.''
   Knapp accused police of dismissing it as a fraternity prank.
   ``We are upset that the police did not seem to take us
seriously,'' she said.
   Caldwell said officers tried to take statements at the sorority
house and from Dorice Kupper, the housemother, but were denied entry
and told the incident had been reported to campus authorities.
   ``The housemother would not allow the officers in,'' Caldwell
said. ``Then she turns around and criticizes us for not taking any
action.''
   Caldwell said prosecutors will consider such charges as unlawful
entry, indecent exposure and theft.
   A woman who answered the sorority's telephone Wednesday said the
sorority had no comments about the raid, and she declined to give
her name. But earlier, Kupper said she was disturbed by officers'
attitude.
   ``The officer tried to discourage the girls from filing charges,
saying they'd be on their record for the rest of their lives and may
keep them (the fraternity members) from getting jobs,'' she said.

   There was discussion of regional issues. The president mentioned
the cooperative effort that we are making together on Southern
Africa. The general secretary commented on his readiness to continue
cooperation on seeking peace in the Middle East. And while we were
waiting for the private meeting to end, Mr. Shevardnadze and I
discussed Cambodia at some length, and his meeting and the general
secretary's meeting with the Chinese foreign minister, and Korea.
There were also references to people-to-people exchanges.
   So you can see that all elements of what we have described as the
four-part agenda came into play, although this was not a kind of
formal meeting, so it was an informal flow from one thing to
another, but I think in many respects very illuminating, as the _
one person or another was drawn out on a subject in an informal way.
And in that sense, served a good purpose of people not only saying
that they wished to see continuity, but in the interplay, kind of
bringing that about by virtue of the presence of the vice president
and the president together there with the general secretary.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, did you have any reaction to his criticism of
our decision on the PLO? Did that come up during the meeting? Do you
have any reaction to what he said during his speech, independent of
whether that came up? And do you have any comment on Mr. Arafat's
meeting in Sweden?
   SHULTZ: Well, as far as his comments in his speech are concerned,
I have, we have described at length the reasons for my decision. The
president supports that decision. Most members of the United States
Senate do. I recognize there are many differences of opinion, and he
expressed his, but that's where we are.
   As far as the meeting in Stockholm is concerned, I read the
report of what was said this morning, and it seems to be a little
bit further clarification, and I welcome that. And there's still a
considerable distance to go.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, this unilateral troop reduction that Gorbachev
announced seems to amount to about 10 percent of Soviet and Eastern
Bloc forces in that area. Does it appear to you at first glance that
that will bring a parity about, because we contend that the Eastern
Bloc has superiority in conventional forces now?
   SHULTZ: There is a superiority, more troops, more tanks, more
various other categories of weapons. And these reductions, being
unilateral, are a welcome and significant step in the right
direction. But even after they're completed in 1991, there still
will be a very significant asymmetry. So there's a lot of
negotiating to do.

   Honduras said the air force
intercepted a Soviet-built Nicaraguan attack helicopter in its air
space Wednesday and the leftist Sandinistas government said an army
defector flew it across the border.
   Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras told a news conference in
Tegucigalpa the ``very sophisticated aircraft was intercepted by
Honduran fighters when it illegally penetrated our territory.''
   He said the Mi-25 helicopter was forced to land at the Toncontin
air base outside Tegucigalpa, the capital, and authorities were
investigating.
   Nicaragua's Defense Ministry said an army defector flew the
chopper to Honduras. It demanded the return of both aircraft and
pilot.
   A Nicaraguan statement identified the pilot as Capt. Edwin
Estrada Leiva and said he landed at Hernan Costa Mejia air base in
Honduras, another name for Toncontin. It said the Foreign Ministry
was in touch with Honduras about the return of the helicopter and of
Estrada, described as a ``CIA terrorist.''
   The Soviet Union has provided Nicaragua's government with about
40 helicopters and the Pentagon says 12 are Mi-25 Hind D ``flying
tanks,'' which can ferry up to 13 soldiers into combat at 200 mph.
   Mi-25s are heavily armed and were used extensively in Afghanistan.
   A New York Times report on March 27 said Chad allowed the United
States last year to examine Soviet arms it had captured from
retreating Libyan forces, including an Mi-24 Hind, in exchange for
$35 million in military aid to the African nation. The Times quoted
the Pentagon as refusing to discuss the matter.
   Pentagon sources said Wednesday an Mi-25 is worth $20-$30 million.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev gave new momentum to arms
control talks Wednesday with his theatrical announcement at the
United Nations that the Red Army would reduce its forces by 10
percent and pull 50,000 of its troops, along with tanks and cannon,
from Eastern Europe.
   U.S. analysts have been predicting such a move for months,
believing it could further boost Gorbachev's popularity in the West
and allow him divert needed funds from the military to the domestic
sector.
   Gorbachev praised U.S. willingness to discuss arms reductions and
said that `the Soviet leadership has decided to demonstrate once
again its readiness to reinforce this healthy process not only in
words but in deeds,''
   ``Within the next two years, their numerical strength will be
reduced by 500,000 men,'' he said near the end of a lengthy address
to the U.N. General Assembly. The Soviet Armed Forces total about
5.6 million men and women.
   ``The numbers of conventional armaments will also be
substantially reduced,'' he said. ``This will be done unilaterally.''
   Gorbachev said the Soviets would pull 50,000 troops out of East
Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, reducing by about 10 percent
the number of forward-deployed Red Army forces arrayed against the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   President Reagan, after he and President-elect Bush met over
lunch with the Soviet leader, said ``I heartily approve'' of the
Kremlin troop decision.
   Conventional arms negotiations will continue, said Reagan, and
``we should certainly adjust (U.S. force levels in Europe) if it
would turn out that this left us with a superiority.''
   Gorbachev and his aides had long been hinting at such a
withdrawal, but had been opposed by top Soviet generals, notably
Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, chief of staff of the Soviet Armed
Forces. Akhromeyev has resigned his post but will continue as an
adviser to Gorbachev on arms control.
   Besides the troop reductions, Gorbachev said the Red Army would
be shedding 10,000 tanks, 8,500 artillery systems and 800 combat
aircraft from forward deployment in Eastern Europe.
   Exact details of the withdrawals were not made public, but they
appeared to fall short of redressing the 2.5-1 edge the Warsaw Pact
holds over NATO in conventional armies.
   ``There still will be a very significant asymmetry so there is
still a lot of negotiating to do,'' Secretary of State George P.
Shultz told reporters at a news conference following the luncheon.
   Nevertheless, Gorbachev's proposals appeared to go a long way
toward addressing U.S. concerns over the heavy concentration of
Soviet forces near the borders of Western Europe.
   A reduction in Soviet forces could increase pressure in Congress
and possibly among pacifists in Western Europe to withdraw some of
the more than 300,000 U.S. forces stationed in West Germany.
   Gorbachev's announcement seemed more significant than a statement
by Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev in 1979 that 20,000 Soviet
troops would pulled out of East Germany. Western analysts later
concluded that there had been no significant reduction in the Soviet
force in the wake of Brezhnevs announcement.
   The action also should impart new momentum to long-stalled talks
to cut NATO and Warsaw Pact forces in Europe, negotiations that have
made virtually no progress in more than 14 years.
   The two blocs, and non-aligned countries in Europe, are now
negotiating the ground rules for a new series of talks to reduce
conventional forces from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains,
at the edge of European Russia.
   Additionally, Gorbachev said cuts would be made ``in the Asian
part of the country, too,'' a gesture likely to improve the
atmosphere of his summit next spring with Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping.
   Gorbachev and his aides have been hinting at the Red Army
reductions in defining what they describe as a new military doctrine
of ``reasonable sufficiency,'' based on an ability to defend against
attack rather than to mount a major offensive.
   Many U.S. officials thought Gorbachev would announce troop cuts
during the Moscow summit last May.
   But senior military officials, led by Akhromeyev, have opposed
any decrease in Soviet forces without a reduction by the West.
   ``In accordance with the new defensive doctrine, we are beginning
to introduce some changes in organizational structure of the Soviet
Armed Forces, in order to impart a defensive nature to the armed
forces, but this will demand some time,'' Akhromeyev said last July
during a visit to the Pentagon.
   ``The complete realization of the changes bears on bilateral
steps,'' he said. ``Therefore we must sit at the negotiating table
and address the outstanding issues between us.''
   To date, U.S. officials have not seen any changes in the size,
armaments and deployment of the Red Army.
   Now, they are certain to be watching closely to see if Gorbachev
is true to his word.

<HEAD>China Gets OK to Buy More Subsidized U.S. Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has been authorized to buy an additional
1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Acting Undersecretary Richard W. Goldberg said the wheat will be
available to China under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to
36.7 bushels of wheat.
   Under EEP arrangements, exporters can sell U.S. commodities at
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then collect
free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses,
or subsidies.
   The subsidies have ranged from less than $20 to more than $40 per
ton of wheat, or in the range of 54 cents to $1.09 per bushel.
   Under previous EEP authorizations, China has bought more than 5
million tons of wheat for delivery in the 1988-89 marketing year,
which began June 1. The previous authorization, which was for 2
million tons, was issued on Aug. 18. All but 10,000 tons of was
used, and that now will be added to the 1 million tons just
announced.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Optimistic, But Cautious on Gorbachev's Troop Withdrawal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON AP) _ Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's promise
of a unilateral reduction in Red Army troops won cautious praise
Wednesday on Capitol Hill, with legislators saying they were pleased
but that they wanted action, not words.
   Gorbachev, in a speech Wednesday to the United Nations, pledged
to cut the Red Army's 5.6 million troop size by 10 percent, and said
he would order some Soviet troops and tanks withdrawn from Eastern
Europe.
   ``Now he's done more than anyone thought he could do
politically,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee. ``His cuts are dramatic and significant _
especially that he will make them unilaterally.''
   But, Aspin added, ``don't be distracted by all the dramatic
numbers you're hearing. We don't fight wars by the numbers.''
   Aspin noted that Gorbachev promised to reorganize the Soviet
military and added, ``a reorganization that removes the Soviet
offensive capability declaws the Russian bear and is far more
important than numbers on a chart.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said, ``Mr. Gorbachev
has promised a lot, but can he deliver? Only his actions _ not just
words _ will tell the world whether his U.N. speech becomes a
one-of-a-kind Christmas gift or just another stocking stuffer.''
   ``If we really see such cutbacks in Eastern Europe, then we might
indeed be seeing a good faith first step toward real conventional
force parity; our negotiators in Vienna will be insisting on no
less,'' Dole said.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, called Gorbachev's statements ``profoundly
welcome.''
   ``If the Soviet government follows through on Gorbachev's pledge,
this will challenge the United States and its allies to act
imaginatively to start a similar process of arms reduction,'' Pell
said.
   Pell said the administration should ``take advantage of the
openings created by Gorbachev's speech to accelerate the momentum of
arms control negotiations on conventional, as well as nuclear,
weapons.''
   Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, the new Senate majority leader,
said ``While (Gorbachev's) proposals are commendable, they must be
considered in view of overall levels of forces in Europe and the
offensive structure of Soviet forces.''
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., top Republican on the Armed Services
Committee, said, ``I would urge a note of caution,'' explaining that
even after the reductions, the Soviets will have ``two and one-half
times as many tanks, three and one-half times as many artillery
pieces'' as NATO forces.
   ``It's too early to tell exactly the impact of these dramatic
announcements,'' he said.
   The Soviets may simply reduce the number of older, less capable
weapons, Warner said. ``The Soviet Union has quite a collection of
antiquated military equipment.''
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., was euphoric. ``Gorbachev's speech
could be the end of the Cold War, the end of the arms race, the end
of the danger of nuclear war and the end of the burdens that we and
they carry on military preparedness.''
   ``Of course, we need deeds, not words,'' he added. ``We have to
see what the Soviets actually do.''
   Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, a member of the Armed Services
Committee and one of the Senate's most conservative members, warned
against having high hopes from Gorbachev's visit to New York.
   ``We must not allow the Soviet public relations machine to use
the warm feelings of the holidays to lull us into a false sense of
security,'' Symms said.
   ``American people do have a breathless naivete in our desire for
peace,'' said Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee. ``That's a nice attitude, but you have to be
careful. If he (Gorbachev) removes the approximate 10 percent he's
talking about, the Soviet Union still has an incredible advantage.
It doesn't make it equal.''

   I think the principal thing that is notable about them, as
described in the speech and then as asked about them during our
meeting, is the attention to trying to affect things like bridging
capabilities that are offensive in nature, and therefore, to try to
have the forces arranged so that they're more clearly defensive in
their nature. But it still remains that after these reductions take
place, and if nothing else takes place, there will be a major
asymmetry in important categories of force structure for the Soviet
Union. But nevertheless, this is a welcome step in the right
direction.
   Q: Can I just follow that up? That was the point that Mr.
Gorbachev made. He said that at the end of these reductions would be
clear that his forces were in a defensive posture. What do you think?
   SHULTZ: Some of the reductions _ and I mentioned an illustration
_ seemed to be pointed in that direction and that's a welcome
development. Obviously, we have sat _ I have sat in the hall and
others watched on television his exposition of this, and so, I'm
giving you a general reaction. But obviously, we're going to sit and
study this out carefully in the United States and in NATO and factor
it into our thinking about how to position ourselves in the coming
conventional arms talks.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, do you agree with Mr. Gorbachev there are no
political prisoners in the Soviet Union? And could you tell us what
you think _ you're getting two questions here for the price of one _
what do you think of his proposal for a mutual suspension of arms
supplies to the belligerents in Afghanistan?
   SHULTZ: Well, as far as prisoners of conscience, political,
religious prisoners are concerned, there have been a great many
released _ a great many. In our opinion, there still are such
prisoners in the Soviet Union, but the number is far less in our
count. Now, there can be differences of opinion about whether
somebody is in prison because of political expression or religious
expression or because of violation of the law. So, what we need and
what I believe it will be possible to construct is a procedure _ a
means _ through which we will go through with them name by name the
people on our list and try to determine whether or not that person
should be released or whether there is some valid reason for the
imprisonment. And I believe that we will be able to get that into
place, and so that'll be a way of answering the question in a kind
of direct, personal sense. Now, you're other question was what?
   Q: The proposal _ he had a very detailed proposal including the
mutual suspension of assistance and military supplies to the
belligerents in Afghanistan. Is that a good idea?
   SHULTZ: Well, of course, we proposed to the Soviet Union quite
some time ago a mutual cessation of supplies, and they rejected
that. And so, as we insisted and they agreed that there had to be
symmetry, we said, ``Well, if you insist on supplying, then we
insist that we will have that right.'' Actually, the mujahedeen
don't need a lot of more supplies because they're capturing a great
deal of supplies.
   But, at any rate, we have been prepared for such a proposal, but
it is tied in with a lot of other things. Of course, the question of
peacekeeping, of trying to help people with reconstruction and
development, that there will be a massive effort needed.
   But, I don't think there is any way there could be agreement that
forces would just continue to hold the ground that they have because
the people of Afghanistan, broadly speaking, do not accept the fact
that the puppet regime is entitled to hold certain areas of that
country.
   Let's review the situation.
   There were 15{ million people estimated as the population of
Afghanistan in 1979. Right now there are a little over three million
refugees in Pakistan, a little over two million in Iran. It's
estimated there are a million and a half casualties, over two
million internal refugees.
   So, I don't think it's surprising that people who have been
subjected to that kind of turmoil don't want to have anything to do
with a puppet regime that seemed to have participated in it.
   Now, I think it is a good thing that the Soviets are now talking
directly to the mujahedeen. And certainly, it is possible the
mujahedeen are ready to negotiate arrangements whereby there won't
be attacks on Soviet forces as they leave. But the key here is,
first and foremost, for the Soviet troops to leave as they are
scheduled to do. And I believe and hope that that will take place.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, you mentioned in your opening statement that
the presence of Vice President Bush himself meant a certain
continuity in the relationship. Was there any discussion there of
meetings between Mr. Bush when he becomes president and Mr.
Gorbachev, or of their foreign ministers or any of these other
apparatus of meetings that we have seen over the past several years?
   SHULTZ: There were general references to the desirability of
having the level of contact, the intensity of contacts at all levels
maintained. There's no immediate plan for any meeting that came out
of the session, as I saw it, of the vice president, when he becomes
president, and the general secretary, although obviously there will
be one at some appropriate moment. No doubt there'll be a foreign
ministers' meeting or two before that. But as the vice president has
said publicly, he has to review the bidding for himself with his new
team and assess the various elements in the relationship. And no
doubt he'll proceed to do that, and things will move forward on an
orderly basis. But the underlying intent is to see things develop in
a positive way insofar as it's possible. And it certainly is quite
possible.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, returning to one of your answers earlier, your
comment on Yasser Arafat's statement in Sweden. You said, ``There's
a considerable way to go.'' A considerable way to go before what? Is
the U.S., having heard these kinds of comments from Arafat, now
prepared to enter a dialogue of any sort of representative of the
PLO?
   SHULTZ: We have, for a long time, had certain set things that we
have said must be said by the PLO, positions they need to adopt, if
we are to have a substantive dialogue with them. And they're well
known. It is the acceptance of U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338 as a
basis for negotiation of Mideast peace; number two, recognition of
Israel's right to exist; and number three, the renunciation of
terrorism in all its forms and a pledge not to engage in it. Those
are the things that we have insisted on. And it is our view that
they need to be said directly, not inferentially, not conditioned.
   So we have seen, at the PNC meeting _ and while I haven't had a
chance to study what was said this morning, I've just heard a brief
report of it, so I don't want to be too definitive about it _ but it
seems that there were some further clarifications in it. I welcome
that. But so far as it's been reported to me, they haven't meet
these conditions. If they meet these conditions, then we're prepared
for a substantive dialogue. We've said that. We'll continue to say
that. That's our position.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, could you give us a bit more of an idea of what
the vice president contributed to today's forum?
   SHULTZ: Well, the vice president was quite active in the
discussion during the luncheon. I can't really say from firsthand in
the private meeting, but I gather that he spoke there, too.
Naturally, he is _ he came here very deliberately as the vice
president, and so it was up to the president to carry the meeting,
which he did, as he always does. But the vice president was very
active in the discussion about chemical weapons.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dan Quayle, investigating how as vice president
he will involve himself in fighting drugs, exploring space and
picking his staff, got some advice from Walter Mondale _ stay away
from trivia.
   Mondale, who was vice president under President Carter and the
Democratic presidential nominee in 1984, said after meeting with
Quayle on Wednesday that the Indiana senator is ``obviously serious
about this job.''
   Although Quayle was denounced by Democrats throughout the
campaign as unfit for the post, Mondale told reporters:
   ``I believe he can do it, and I believe he wants to do it. He's
been elected by the people of the United States and we all better
hope that he does a good job.''
   Mondale said he warned Quayle to resist being diverted from
significant issues into trivial pursuits.
   ``I told him I thought a big danger of the vice presidency is to
be trivialized, to be given a number of functions, to prove they're
important when in fact we have other agencies to do that work,''
Mondale said.
   ``He ought to use his time to work on the really important
matters. ... After all, Mr. Quayle might become president. He ought
to be working on issues of significance.''
   Quayle called Mondale for the meeting as he continued to solicit
advice from former vice presidents on how to handle the office. He
already has met with former President Nixon, who was vice president
under Dwight Eisenhower, and plans to see former President Gerald
Ford, who was Nixon's vice president.
   Quayle also met Wednesday with NASA Director James Fletcher and
Gen. John Piotrowsky, head of the U.S. Space Command, to discuss
space policy. Bush has said he would appoint his vice president to
head the new U.S. Space Council, a body created by Congress to shape
the direction of U.S. space policy.
   And he met with Bush transition officials Craig Fuller and Boyden
Gray. Fuller, Bush's longtime chief of staff who has said he is
leaving government after the transition, would be able to advise
Quayle on selection of his own staff. Gray, who is serving as legal
counsel to Bush's transition office and will be White House legal
counsel when Bush takes office, was discussing in part the role of
the drug czar who will be appointed by the president.
   Bush initially said he wanted his vice president to oversee the
administration's drug-fighting efforts, but recently passed
congressional legislation calls for a drug czar who is not a member
of the Cabinet. Quayle has said he would look into the propriety of
such options as having the drug czar report to him or having that
person be part of his staff, said press spokesman Jim Carroll.
   Quayle also met Wednesday with Indianapolis Mayor William Hudnut
in what Caroll described as a courtesy call by the mayor who was in
Washington on other business. The meeting was not set up to discuss
whether Hudnut should succeed Quayle as the senator from Indiana,
said Carroll.
   Mondale said it was apparent Quayle had been boning up on the
vice presidency and thinking a lot about how to approach it. Quayle
sought ideas on how much time he should spend on Capitol Hill, on
administrative matters and on official functions, Mondale said.
   ``There's going to be pressure on him to take on a lot of little
functions to prove he's doing something. I said, reject that advice
and just stay on the big issues,'' Mondale said.
   Mondale and Carter were the object of harsh rhetoric from Quayle
during the presidential campaign this year, as he sought to tie
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis to what Republicans dubbed the
failed liberal policies of the past.
   Mondale said he had not been ``too flattering about him,
either,'' and indicated that was behind them now.
   Meanwhile Quayle has selected veteran Time magazine correspondent
David Beckwith as his press secretary.
   Beckwith recently covered the Bush campaign for 15 months and
said of Quayle:
   ``I've talked to him a lot over the last couple weeks. I realize
he's a lot better than his press notices would make him appear,'' he
said noting the rash of negative publicity about Quayle's past and
credentials that hit the vice president-elect when Bush picked him.

   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev supervised
intelligence and strategic missiles and earned the respect of his
Western counterparts during a 48-year military career that ended
with his retirement.
   Akhromeyev, the military chief of staff, traveled with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to his Reykjavik and Washington summits
with President Reagan and visited the Pentagon in July to meet with
U.S. military officials.
   But Akhromeyev, 65, did not show up in New York for the latest
summit, which began Wednesday, and Soviet officials there announced
that Akhromeyev had retired for health reasons. It was the same day
Gorbachev announced unilateral cuts in Soviet conventional forces.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, in New York,
denied that Akhromeyev resigned in protest over the troop cutback
plan, which Gorbachev disclosed in a speech to the United Nations.
But top Soviet military officials have opposed any reduction in
Soviet forces without corresponding moves by the West.
   The marshal will remain as an adviser to Gorbachev, Gerasimov
said.
   Akhromeyev's resignation was not immediately reported by the
Soviet press, and no successor was named.
   Akhromeyev supervised military intelligence and strategic nuclear
weapons on the Soviet general staff before becoming its chief in
September 1984.
   U.S. counterparts who sat across the table from him during the
1986 Reykjavik, Iceland, summit said he earned their respect.
   ``He was tough and determined, but he was trying to get an
agreement,'' one senior U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
   After the talks failed to produce an agreement, Akhromeyev said
of his American counterpart Paul Nitze, ``I thought I could outlast
him, but I didn't.''
   Akhromeyev, during his trip to the Pentagon, said the Soviet
Union was reorganizing its military in line with a policy of giving
it a more purely defensive character, but that the changes would
take time. Gorbachev, in his U.N. address, also talked about the
switch to a defensive posture.
   At a news conference in June, Akhromeyev, who held top military
posts under former President Leonid I. Brezhnev, criticized
Brezhnev's foreign policy. ``We used to be too forthright in our
reaction to the arms race pursued by the West,'' he said.
   He blamed the Reagan administration for starting the arms race
but said the Soviets should not have been so willing to respond in
kind.
   Akhromeyev, a burly man with a strong voice that commanded the
meetings he had with foreign journalists in Moscow, abruptly
replaced Nikolai V. Ogarkov as chief of general staff. Ogarkov was
an advocate of turning to new military technologies instead of
building more nuclear warheads.
   Six months after Akhromeyev took the job, Gorbachev became the
Soviet leader and began his active search for arms agreements with
the West.
   Gorbachev fired Defense Minister Sergei L. Sokolov in May 1987
after amateur pilot Mathias Rust of West Germany threaded Soviet air
defenses to land a small private plane on Moscow's Red Square.
   But he promoted Dmitri T. Yazov, a strong supporter of extending
Gorbachev's reforms to the military, over Akhromeyev and several
other senior officers as the new defense minister.
   Akhromeyev has been in the Soviet military since 1940. In August
1942, during some of the grimmest days of World War II for the
Soviet Union, he was discharged from the naval academy and sent to
the army front line.
   There he gained wide experience infantry and tank troops and
worked his way up the ranks. He became a full member of the
Communist Party Central Committee in 1983.

   And he made his comments about continuity, and at the same time
his own need, of course, to study the situation for himself and
develop his own positions. So, he was in and out of the conversation
in a very comfortable and strong way.
   Q: It's not clear to me how much real discussion there was on
Gorbachev's conventional cut proposal.
   SHULTZ: There was very little discussion of it at the luncheon.
And you have to remember, he made this speech this morning. The
president and the vice president, neither one of them heard it, and
I heard it, but it was an extensive thing and we tried to write it
down as best we can, but that's no basis for having any intensive
discussion beyond asking him, well, what does he have in mind? He
has in mind trying to restructure things so that they're more
clearly defensive in nature. So we are interested in that comment
and we'll study this carefully.
   Q: You didn't draw him out and he didn't really elaborate that
much on his proposal?
   SHULTZ: Well, I've reported on the range of things that we talked
about. The meeting was a luncheon broad discussion. It was a very _
I thought it was a very _ it was a very interesting luncheon to take
part in. It was _ hit interesting topics, and there was a good flow
across things that had important substance connected with them, and
at the same time rather informal. And Mr. Gorbachev talked about the
situation in Azerbaijan and what that meant, and so on. It was that
kind of a discussion. It wasn't in any remote sense a negotiating
session or anything of that kind, but in many ways better than a
negotiating session.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, in his speech, Soviet leader Gorbachev talked
several times about new thinking. He talked about the need for
cooperation, coexistence of several systems. Do you believe that
this new thinking is for real, to stay? An element of propaganda?
   SHULTZ: I'll just give you my own opinion. I don't think there is
a shadow of a doubt that an effort is under way to change the nature
of the Soviet system. That is what Mr. Gorbachev says. That is what
all of the evidence that we can see suggests. So I _ (chuckling) _ I
don't have any doubt that that's so. Now, how successful can he be
in making these changes, and how fast will it happen? Of course
nobody can answer those questions. But that there is a major effort
going on to change things, I really don't see how that's even an
open question.

<HEAD>NEW YORK: open question.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Do you agree with his appeal then that the days of the cold
war are past?
   SHULTZ: Well, I listened to the vice president answer that
question yesterday. I thought he gave a pretty good answer, which
was, the words ``cold war'' mean one thing to you, another thing to
me, another thing to somebody else. And I think the important point
is that there has been a very powerful change in the nature of the
relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and more
broadly, in the East-West relationship. And you can see it in the
things that have been settled in arms control; you can see it in,
for example, the ability we have to collaborate effectively, for
example, in what we're doing in Southern Africa; you can see it in
an altogether different manner of discussion of the area of human
rights; you can see it in our bilateral relations. So I don't know
whether you want to say that's the end of the cold war or not, but
it's different, a lot different, and for my tastes, a lot better.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, with respect to the last answer, if you could
amplify it, do you have any concern that the allies will show
disagreement about what is going on in the Soviet Union?
Particularly, do you have any concern that the level of credit going
from the Europeans to the Soviet Union might not serve to dismantle
the Soviet's military (inaudible)?
   SHULTZ: Well, we meet a lot, the allies do, the European allies,
and we and the Japanese, and Koreans, Australians and so forth. We
have a very active process of talk among us that goes on constantly.
As soon as we get through here I get on my plane and go to Brussels,
and I'll spend all day tomorrow and Friday morning with the NATO
allies; and I'll spend Friday afternoon at the European Commission.
And these are the things we talk about. And people have different
views, but we kind of put them in a pot and look at them, and there
has emerged from it a rather common view and a cohesive set of
policies. And of course it's a constant sort of a moving target in a
way.
   Now, as far as credit is concerned, we have a general
understanding that non-COCOM restricted trade with the Soviet Union
is _ no one sees any problem with that, and that if there are
credits, they should be on a strictly commercial basis. No one feels
that it is _ that the Soviet Union _ should be subsidized. So, after
you've said that, then you observe these credits and, in terms of
the total flow of such things at this point, at least it doesn't
appear to me to be any particular problem. But, the creditors as
commercial creditors, of course, have to ask themselves, ``I'm going
to loan some money. Am I going to get it back? Am I going to get it
serviced,'' and so on. They have to make those calculations as
people whose money that is.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, can you say whether or not Mr. Gorbachev's
assurances on....
   SHULTZ: I can't hear you.
   Q: Can you say whether Mr. Gorbachev's assurances on
institutionalizing human rights reforms in the Soviet Union were
satisfactory enough to now conclude the Vienna talks and go on to
the conventional force talks?
   SHULTZ: Well, as far as the Vienna talks are concerned, of
course, this is a multinational negotiation and we reflect our views
into that in Vienna and decisions will have to emerge from that
setting. But, I think there is no question that in his speech Mr.
Gorbachev touched all of the key issues that we have been
discussing. One of them was the importance of institutionalizing and
making law, making rules, whereby things are regulated so you get
away from ad hoc decisions by some person in the bureaucracy that
say, ``Yes, we'll let this person go or we won't let that person
go,'' and rather you say, ``There is a regulation about, for
instance, the question of security secrets and there'll be a time
limit and there'll be an understanding when somebody is hired,'' and
so on. So, we welcome that kind of procedure.
   Now, what will we want to do? Well, we will want to dig in with
them and get the detail that lies underneath the statements that the
general secretary made in his speech today. However, when the leader
of the Soviet Union gets up in front of the world, in effect, and
says that they are going to do certain things, then I think you have
to expect that those things are going to happen. And we will, of
course, explore them. But, I thought that it was a very helpful
speech in that regard.
   STAFF: We have just time for one more question.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, in his speech, Mr. Gorbachev also referred to
the START talks and recommitted himself to the goal of a 50 percent
reduction in strategic weapons. Was that discussed in the lunch at
all or in the meeting this afternoon, particularly in the context of
continuing these under President Bush?
   SHULTZ: It really wasn't discussed much beyond the general
secretary mentioning it and the vice president saying that, of
course he was interested in that, but he will have to study it for
himself and take his position. So that's about the extent of it.
There wasn't any detailed discussion of that, just as there wasn't
any sort of detailed, negotiator-like discussion of any of these
issues. It was a much more general kind of discussion.
   Q: Well, when you say that the vice president will actually
decide on his position on it, do you have any reason to doubt that
those negotiations will continue in the next administration and be
precedent?
   SHULTZ: Well, I would think that they would be, but a new
president comes in, he collects a new national security group around
him, so naturally he will want to look at the various positions that
have been taken and where the issues now are and what are his views
about them. And since the vice president has been part of what has
happened in the Reagan administration, there is a certain built-in
presumption of continuity, but I think that the vice president is
quite correct in saying, obviously, he's a new president, and he's
got to look at it for himself and decide for himself where he wants
to go. So he's, I think, being properly straightforward in saying
he's going to do that, while, at the same time, expressing his
general view of the importance of continuity in that and other
things.
   Q: And did he tell Secretary Gorbachev that?
   (No response.)

<TEXT>
   George Bush and two long-time friends he has
named to his Cabinet are partners in a Texas barge company, an
investment that earned the president-elect more than $20,000 last
year.
   Bush, Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III, and
Commerce Secretary-designate Robert Mosbacher Sr., all are limited
partners of Hollywood LPG No. 2 Ltd., one of several limited
partnerships run by Houston-based Hollywood Marine Inc., state
records show.
   Bush in 1987 reported $20,773 in income from the company. The
money was listed as ``passive income'' on his federal tax return,
meaning Bush has no say in business decisions. The investment also
is listed on his annual financial disclosure forms, which are
reviewed by government ethics officials.
   ``We think it's an honor to have them'' as part of the company,
said Robert Egan, vice president and secretary of Hollywood Marine.
   Hollywood LPG No. 2 Ltd. was formed in 1978 and at the time owned
four barges, according to records filed with the Texas Secretary of
State.
   Bush and Baker each were given 2.2 percent ownership of the
company for an investment of $50,000 apiece. Mosbacher was assigned
4.7 percent interest for $105,000. Hollywood Marine was assigned 67
percent ownership for an investment of just $1,000, a routine
arrangement with general partners.
   None of the three men has an active role in the business, Egan
said. Other limited partners include other Mosbacher family members
and friends. Egan said the group was put together by Mosbacher.
   Mosbacher has raised campaign funds for Bush in every political
race he has entered since his second unsuccessful campaign for the
Senate in 1970. Mosbacher served as Bush's finance chairman during
the presidential campaign and raised nearly $20 million. He also was
chairman of the Republican Party's ``Team 100,'' which raised $24
million from individuals and corporations in $100,000 donations.
   Baker resigned as treasury secretary earlier this year to manage
the Bush presidential campaign.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Plans Under Way to Redesign Radar Installation</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Summit Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said
Wednesday he is prepared to redesign and place under U.N. control a
Soviet radar installation that President Reagan charges violates the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   The proposal was slightly different from an earlier Soviet plan
that the United States has said is unacceptable.
   In his address to the U.N. General Assembly, Gorbachev proposed
incorporating the radar installation at Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, into
an ``all-embracing regime for peaceful work in outer space.''
   The Kremlin leader said he already has decided to place the
installation under the authority of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
   ``Soviet scientists are prepared to receive their foreign
colleagues and discuss with them ways of converting it into an
international center for peaceful cooperation by dismantling and
refitting certain units and structures, and to provide additional
equipment,'' Gorbachev said.
   ``The entire system could function under the auspices of the
United Nations,'' he said.
   Reagan, in an unclassified version of his report to Congress on
U.S.-Soviet arms control agreements last week, said the large
phased-array radar near Krasnoyarsk ``constitutes a significant
violation of a central element'' of the 1972 treaty.
   The report added: ``Despite U.S. requests, no action has been
taken, nor Soviet proposals made, that would correct this
violation.''
   Reagan has demanded that the installation be dismantled.
   The president said recent Soviet proposals to modify the
Krasnoyarsk installation or to convert it into an international
space research facility would not correct the violation.
   ``Such an action would not eliminate the prohibited radar
capability or reverse the lead-time advantage already gained by
Krasnoyarsk construction,'' the report said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that Reagan raised
the issue of the radar installation at the luncheon with Gorbachev
and Vice President George Bush.
   Fitzwater said Gorbachev repeated the Soviet position that ``they
were transferring it to research uses.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, in a news conference held
after the luncheon, said the Soviet leader was asked whether he used
the word dismantle in referring to the radar installation.
   ``It was pointed out in his speech the general secretary had used
the word dismantle. Did we hear that word right? And he said `Yes,
that was the word I used,''' Shultz said.

   Christmas shoppers and power lunchers went about
their business Wednesday as if Mikhail S. Gorbachev had never left
the Kremlin, but his late-afternoon motorcade finally plunged
Manhattan traffic into dreaded ``Gorbylock.''
   For the morning rush-hour, warnings of gridlock evidently scared
enough motorists to produce a ``significant drop in volumes'' all
over the city, according to Transportation Department spokesman
Victor Ross.
   ``I came this morning across the 59th Street Bridge. Queens Plaza
looked like the Sahara. The only thing that was missing were the
camels,'' said Ross, who earlier had issued dire traffic predictions.
   But those predictions were fufilled when Gorbachev's motorcade
took its afternoon tour of Wall Street, midtown Manhattan and Times
Square, said Deputy Transportation Commissioner Sam Schwartz.
   ``Those people who did come in got caught,'' said Schwartz during
the height of the ``Gorbylock'' at about 5:15 p.m. ``It's little
consolation to them that there was a 15 percent dropoff in traffic.''
   Earlier in the day, up and down the Gorbachev midtown Manhattan
motorcade route, the story was the same. Sure, Gorbachev's coming,
but whaddaya want me to do about it?
   ``People aren't really talking about it yet. Maybe later on,''
said Patrick Coan, an employee at the Charivari store on West 57th
Street _ one of the streets on the route of the blocks-long
Gorbachev motorcade Wednesday afternoon.
   Although the store's front window was completely done in red,
Coan said it had nothing to do with Gorbachev's impending arrival:
``Nobody else has picked up on that. Actually, it's just to
encourage people to have a red Christmas instead of a white
Christmas.''
   As the Soviet leader addressed the United Nations, assistant
manager Tim Higbie of the Barnes and Noble book store on Seventh
Avenue confirmed ``some of his books are around here,'' although
they weren't selling particularly well.
   Higbie seemed unimpressed that Gorbachev would later pass the
store. There were no plans to put his tomes on the ``book for a
buck'' table; his ``At The Summit'' would still run buyers $16.11,
he said.
   As President Reagan and Gorbachev sat down for their afternoon
repast on Governors Island, power-lunchers and tourists around the
city sat down for their own meals.
   The manager at the Russian Tea Room, facing what one waiter
confided was an overbooked lunch hour, couldn't be bothered with
Gorby-talk. At the Hard Rock Cafe, the British and American flags
flew _ no sign of the Soviet hammer and sickle _ over the heads of
dozens of tourists waiting to eat.
   Outside the Henri Bendel store on West 57th Street, doorman
Charles Rome opened a limousine door and let a patron inside,
blissfully unaware that 45 limos carrying Gorbachev, his wife Raisa
and assorted Soviet associates would soon be cruising by the
exclusive women's clothing store.
   ``No. Down this street? I heard he was in town, but I didn't know
he was coming through here,'' said Rome, a Manhattanite who also
observed traffic on the crosstown street was lighter than usual.
   Tourists filled midtown to visit the usual holiday hot spots:
Radio City Music Hall and the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree and
skating rink. Shoppers packed Bloomingdale's and Macy's, oblivious
to warnings of traffic jams and rumors of a shopping spree by Raisa
Gorbachev.
   ``We've got the typical pre-Christmas crowds. The store's very
crowded,'' said Bloomingdale's spokeswoman Miraed Smith. ``Of
course, we're right near a subway stop, bus stops, and the Soviet
embassy.''
   Even the out-of-towners weren't too concerned about Gorbachev's
trip around town. Sixty-nine students from Martin Luther King High
School in Philadelphia were at the Cort Theater to see the matinee
of ``Sarafina!''; they had no plans to look for the Soviet leader
when it was over.
   ``We're getting out, getting on the bus and going home,'' said
Sam Colson, a chaperone with the group. ``We won't see Gorbachev _
nothing personal.''

   President-elect George Bush said Wednesday that
the superpower luncheon with President Reagan and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev was ``a good, productive meeting'' and that
there was no pressure now for him to have his own summit with the
Kremlin leader.
   Describing the two hours of talks on Governors Island in New York
Harbor, Bush said, ``There was no pressing on substantive details,''
although he said there were some substantive discussions.
   Bush said he made clear to Gorbachev that he wanted to continue
the progress that's been made during the Reagan administration in
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   With his national security team still being assembled, Bush said,
``I also made clear that we needed some time and he understood that.
He didn't seem to have any problem with that at all.''
   As the three leaders parted in New York, Bush told Gorbachev, ``I
enjoyed the meeting. Hope to see you soon.''
   Afterward, Secretary of State George Shultz said Bush was ``quite
active in the discussion during the luncheon.''
   He said Bush's presence provided proof of the desire on both
sides to continue the dialogue that Reagan and Gorbachev had begun.
   Bush said that once his national security team is in place and
the administration's strategy has been set, Secretary of
State-designate James A. Baker III would contact NATO allies and
consult with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   ``At an appropriate time a meeting between me and General
Secretary Gorbachev can be discussed,'' Bush said. ``But there's no
pressure on that. The main thing is to formulate our plans and move
them forward so we have progress. That's what I want.''
   Asked if the timing of a Bush-Gorbachev summit had been
discussed, he replied, ``No, there wasn't any discussion of it at
all.''
   Outside the luncheon, Bush played a decidedly low-key role,
remaining in the background for the most part as Reagan and
Gorbachev greeted each other in their fifth and final meeting.
   In a visible demonstration of his status, Bush rode in the
limousine jumpseat, with two translators, facing backward as he
accompanied Reagan and Gorbachev on a brief ride to a departure
ceremony on the island.
   Bush seemed at ease in the presence of the superpower leaders.
   Clowning around, Bush pretended he was going to pitch himself
into New York Harbor from a waterside platform when photographers
shouted to the trio to keep changing position as they viewed the
Statue of Liberty.
   Smiling broadly, Bush seemed bemused as Gorbachev talked at
length about the luncheon at the conclusion of the departure
ceremony.
   Neither Reagan nor Bush commented then, but Bush volunteered a
statement to reporters upon his return to Washington.
   Standing under the wing of Air Force Two, Bush said, ``I think it
was a good, productive meeting. It was really, in a sense, a salute
to President Reagan, giving him an opportunity to thank General
Secretary Gorbachev.''
   Saying that some substance had been discussed, Bush said,
``Generally, it worked out as well as I had hoped.''
   Bush said Gorbachev seemed very upbeat after the meeting. ``It's
not surprising. I felt the same general feeling there. There's no
question that Mr. Gorbachev is a very different individual from his
predecessors. He's a warm human being, and people see that.
   ``He's committed to change,'' Bush added.
   He said Gorbachev's speech to the United Nations earlier in the
day, in which he proposed a 500,000-man cutback in Soviet forces,
``had some positive elements in it, and I think that he felt that
that had gone well.
   ``So why shouldn't he feel good?'' Bush said. ``He and President
Reagan had had a very good relationship, and he was saying farewell
to a man with whom he's worked very closely.''
   Asked specifically about the troop cutback proposal, Bush said,
``It's a good decision,'' adding that he would have to see the
specifics of the proposal.
   ``But the general idea of a reasonably substantial, unilateral
reduction is fine. There's no way that that can result in a balance
of forces, but still it's a step, and so applaud it as a positive
step.''
   He said it did not compel the United States to do anything.
   While carving out a secondary role for himself, Bush and others
have noted that Gorbachev is aware who will be president on Jan. 20,
when Reagan leaves office.
   ``The next U.S. administration headed by President-elect George
Bush will find in us a partner who is ready _ without long pauses or
backtracking _ to continue the dialogue in a spirit of realism,
openness and goodwill, with a willingness to achieve concrete
results working on the agenda which covers the main issues of
Soviet-U.S. relations and world politics,'' Gorbachev said in his
address to the United Nations.
   When Reagan greeted Gorbachev on the steps of the two-story,
brick Admiral's House on Governors Island, Bush remained inside the
building for a few moments, allowing the two leaders to pose for
pictures together.
   Bush then quietly stepped outside and joined Reagan and
Gorbachev, shaking hands with the Soviet leader.
   Gorbachev greeted the vice president effusively, taking Bush's
hand in both of his.
   While Reagan and Gorbachev answered several questions, Bush
declined to speak.

   Western Europe welcomed Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
pledge Wednesday to reduce Soviet conventional forces, but tempered
the praise with warnings that the Warsaw Pact still will have
military superiority over NATO.
   Television in communist Poland carried footage without comment of
the Soviet leader announcing at the United Nations in New York that
he will reduce troop levels by 500,000 and remove 5,000 tanks and
other arms within two years.
   Jacek Czaputowicz, co-founder of Poland's anti-nuclear Peace and
Freedom Movement, said in Warsaw the announcement could be the
``first step'' in pulling Soviet troops out of Poland.
   East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, from whose territory
50,000 Soviet soldiers and 5,000 tanks are to be withdrawn, made no
comment.
   An official statement in London said Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, the most hawkish head of a NATO government, ``warmly
welcomed'' Gorbachev's pledge and will discuss it with him next week
during his stop in Britain en route home.
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said in Brussels it
``seems to be a step in the right direction'' but that considerable
imbalances would remain.
   The 500-share index of London's Financial Times reversed a slump
and rose 1.99 points to close at 997.29. The dollar jumped initially
on hopes a Soviet cutback would mean reciprocal U.S. defense
reductions and a shrinking of the American deficit, but fell back
when dealers realized it was too soon to know.
   Widespread selling of gold resulted from the dollar's surge,
pushing the bullion price in London and Zurich down $4 to about $423
an ounce.
   Mrs. Thatcher's ``first reaction was that she warmly welcomed the
cuts in forces and armaments proposed by Mr. Gorbachev as an
important step toward securing a better balance of conventional
forces in Europe in view of the Soviets' present overwhelming
superiority,'' said a statement from her office at 10 Downing Street.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl now sees a ``good chance to reach
conventional weapons stability in Europe,'' said Friedhelm Ost,
chief spokesman for the West German government.
   Rupert Scholz, Kohl's defense minister, said Gorbachev must
follow up with ``actual and verifiable withdrawal of troops and
reduction of forces.''
   Franz Vranitzky, chancellor of Austria, called Gorbachev's
statement ``a courageous and constructive proposal.''
   Former British defense secretaries Michael Heseltine,
Conservative, and Denis Healey, Labor, disagreed in a television
debate about how enthusiastically to welcome Gorbachev's pledge.
   Heseltine said: ``If you're suggesting that, because he has made
a gesture which leaves him with vast superiority in conventional
forces I should say that there is no further threat, that is naive
to a fault.
   ``Even after Mr. Gorbachev has carried through all the reductions
he has promised ... he will have 3{ times as many artillery pieces
as NATO, 2{ times as many tanks, double the number of men and double
the number of aircraft.''
   Healey said the Soviets no longer are a threat and that no Soviet
government, even Josef Stalin's, ever intended to invade Western
Europe.
   ``The important thing now is, we have the chance of working
together with the Russians to create stability and peace in
Europe,'' he declared. ``We ought to grab it with both hands.''
   Paul Rodgers, an analyst at the Department of Peace Studies in
Bradford, northern England, said Gorbachev has the ulterior motive
of sabotaging Western agreement on modernizing nuclear forces. NATO
has not yet agreed on what to do after intermediate-range missiles
are withdrawn from Europe under the U.S.-Soviet treaty.
   ``It is going to make it much more difficult for NATO to agree on
a decision to modernize nuclear weapons,'' Rodgers said.
   Henry A. Kissinger, national security adviser and secretary of
state under President Richard M. Nixon, said in New York: ``I think
it's an important speech. The tone was positive and many of the
ideas were very worthwhile for examination, so I think it's a good
basis for relations after the new administration takes over in the
United States.''
   Dante M. Caputo, Argentine foreign minister and president of the
U.N. General Assembly, said the speech reflected ``a sort of new
philosophical approach in Soviet foreign policy, and I think this is
very, very important. I think this speech is going to very important
in the next decade.''
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada said the troop cuts
``will begin to reduce the imbalance in conventional forces which
have concerned Canada and its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization for so long.''

   Some toys stocked in stores this Christmas could
turn child's play into tragedy, but the government isn't doing
enough to keep the hazards out of children's hands, a child safety
advocate said Tuesday.
   ``People have been lulled into a false sense of security thinking
there are safety standards,'' said lawyer and crusader Edward Swartz
at a news conference to announce his 17th annual ``10 Worst Toys''
list.
   Dangerous toys on Swartz's list ranged from a $1 play sword to an
elaborate battery-operated riding toy.
   Swartz said the government should impose stricter standards to
protect children. However, a spokeswoman for the Consumer Product
Safety Commission defended its efforts.
   ``We don't have pre-market clearance,'' said Anne Pavlich. ``We
depend on people like this to let us know which toys they feel are
not safe.''
   Here is Swartz's list:
   _The ``Sweetheart'' battery-operated riding toy by Power Wheels.
Swartz blasted the toy for its potential speed of 5 mph and 6 volt
rechargeable batteries housed in unsecured areas.
   Chip Herman, vice president of Kransco Corp., the parent company
which marketed the Sweetheart, said it has been discontinued because
it resembles the three-wheeled All Terrain Vehicles banned this year.
   _The Battle Beasts Warrior Sword. Swartz said the toy could cause
injuries with its long rigid blade. This toy also was discontinued,
because of poor sales, said Bernie Epstein, senior vice president of
manufacturer Imperial Toy Corp. of Los Angeles.
   _The Johnny Jump Up Baby Exerciser by Evenflo Juvenile Furniture
Co. Swartz said an infant could injure itself by hitting the side of
the doorway in the swinglike seat that clamps to the top of a
doorway.
   Evenflo officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
   _Three toy weapons: the .22 Caliber Pellet Firing Target Pistol,
offered by Guarantee Distributors, the Challenger Rubberband Target
Shooter, made by the Artner Corp. of Boisie, Ind., and Attack Force,
an ``automatic'' motorized cap machine pistol.
   Swartz said such toy weapons and projectiles ``have virtually
turned some nurseries into armed camps.''
   Dan Shure, president of the Strombecker Corp. which manufactures
the cap gun, said the product is not dangerous if used correctly.
Officials with Guarantee Distributors did not return a telephone
call and Artner's phone number has been disconnected.
   _Four products were cited for having small parts that Swartz said
could choke a toddler: ``My Train,'' a wooden train set manufactured
by Vermont-based Montgomery Schoolhouse; a Burger King Cheeseburger
Set, manufactured by Multi Toys Corp.; the Paddington's 30th
Anniversary Bear, made by Eden Toy, and My Ladybird First Pull Along
Puzzle, made by Berchet.
   Spokesmen for Montgomery, Multi Toys and Eden Toys all stressed
that their products met U.S. safety standards. Berchet, maker of My
Ladybird, did not immediately return telephone calls requesting
comment.

   PLO leader Yasser Arafat ended two days of talks
with a U.S. Jewish delegation Wednesday by endorsing a statement
accepting Israel's right to exist.
   At a news conference, however, Arafat seemed less straightforward
than the document he endorsed, and he declined to confirm or repeat
the statement's key clauses.
   The document, which also denounced terrorism, was hailed by the
Jewish group as the most unequivocal acceptance of Israel ever given
by the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Jewish group urged the
U.S. government to end its ban on talks with the PLO.
   Foreign Minister Sten Andersson, who arranged the meeting, called
the document ``historic,'' but said it was one step in a long
process.
   Arafat described it as ``nothing new,'' but was ``an accurate
reading and interpretation'' of the policy declaration adopted last
month by the PLO's legislative arm, the Palestine National Council.
   The PLO's parliament-in-exile endorsed U.N. resolutions 242 and
338, which recognize the right of all states in the region to exist
within secure borders. But the council did not mention Israel by
name.
   The two-page statement released Wednesday said the council
``established the independent state of Palestine and accepted the
existence of Israel as a state in the region.''
   The council also ``declared its rejection and condemnation of
terrorism in all its forms, including state terrorism,'' said the
English-language document, read by Andersson and distributed to
reporters.
   Arafat said the renunciation of terrorism excluded the uprising
by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
which enters its second year Thursday.
   ``The uprising will continue week after week until the end of the
Israeli occupation of our homeland,'' he said.
   He also said he remained committed to his 1985 Cairo declaration
to end terrorism outside Israel and the occupied territories.
   ``There was no greater thrill in my life than when Yasser Arafat
signed on last night, very clearly, very assertedly, the acceptance
of the state of Israel in the region (and) a denunciation of
violence,'' said Stanley Sheinbaum, a Los Angeles publisher and
economist.
   In New York, the president of the American-Arab Relations
Committee, M.T. Mehdi, broke ranks with Arafat on Wednesday, telling
a group of Arabs that ``Arafat is no longer my friend; his
recognition of Israel will not lead to peace in Palestine.''
   In Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said it was
``very strange'' that Arafat refused to make the declaration
himself, but he made no comment on the substance of the document.
   ``If the PLO has something to say, since when is the Swedish
foreign minister a PLO spokesman ... What, Arafat doesn't know how
to read and write?'' Peres said.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitshak Shamir rejected the statement,
saying the PLO's goal remains the destruction of the Jewish state.
   President Reagan declined comment, saying his administration had
not had time to study the text. The United States has demanded the
PLO recognize Israel's right to exist and renounce terrorism before
it begins talks with the organization.
   The five-member Jewish group sought the assurances to clear away
misgivings left from the Palestinian council resolutions regarding
recognition of Israel.
   Asked to endorse the clause verbally, Arafat replied: ``This was
clear in resolutions adopted in the last session of our Palestine
National Council where we said clearly there are two states in
Palestine, the Palestinian state and the Jewish state, Israel.''
   Despite Arafat's evasiveness, the Jewish delegation said the
wording in the document was stronger than the formula sought by
Washington, and could clear the way for U.S.-PLO talks.
   ``The conditions the United States has been insisting on since
1976 have been met,'' said delegation leader Rita Hauser of New York.
   The delegation has been widely dismissed by Israel and by U.S.
Jewish leaders, since none represented a major U.S. Jewish group.
   The group was from the U.S. arm of the International Center for
Peace in the Middle East, a Tel Aviv-based leftist group with
branches in Israel, the United States and Europe.
   Morris B. Abram, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of
Major Jewish Organizations, said in New York that the group members
were ``willing dupes of the PLO.''
   ``Arafat says he rejects terrorism, but he declares the intefadeh
(uprising) will continue,'' Abram said. ``That is a typical Arafat
deception.''

   Examination of a skeleton believed
to be that of a Marine left in the desert during a training exercise
revealed he died of exposure to scorching heat, the coroner's office
said.
   ``The cause of death is exposure,'' said deputy coroner Tom
Dewhirst of the San Bernardino County Coroner's Office. Positive
identification won't be determined until dental charts are compared
on Wednesday, Dewhirst said.
   The remains, a wallet containing the identification of Marine
Lance Cpl. Jason Rother, an M-16 rifle and a grenade launcher were
found Sunday near the community of Bagdad.
   The town is two miles north of the sprawling Marine Corps Air
Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, 125 miles east of Los
Angeles. The remains were less than a mile from former Highway 66
and 17 miles from where Rother was dropped off for a night training
exercise Aug. 31.
   Rother, 19, of Minneapolis, was attached to a unit based at Camp
Lejeune, N.C. He was acting as a road guard, directing traffic as
convoys maneuvered through the night and was to have been picked up
at 1 p.m. Aug. 31.
   A mix up in communications left him in three days of scorching
heat with three canteens of water. He was reported missing 1{ days
later.
   Three officers are facing court-martial in connection with
Rother's disappearance and two others have been relieved of their
commands.

   A federal law that stripped governors of
their power to veto National Guard training missions dictated by the
federal government is unconstitutional, a federal appeals court
ruled Tuesday.
   However, another federal appeals court has ruled just the
opposite and the two rulings presumably will have to be considered
by the Supreme Court.
   A panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1
Tuesday that the so-called Montgomery Amendment, taking away a
governor's control over National Guard units, is unconstitutional.
   The amendment was challenged by Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, who
objected to the Defense Department ordering Minnesota Guard units to
Central America. Governors of other states also have objected and
the states of Massachusetts, Ohio, Colorado, Vermont and Maine
supported Minnesota's lawsuit.
   However, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in October
rejected a similar challenge to the amendment filed by Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Dukakis said in a statement: ``Today's ruling by the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals is a victory for common sense, the
Constitution and the governors of the United States.''
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon said the state was
now more likely to appeal the 1st Circuit ruling.
   `Today's ruling in the Minnesota case was what we argued here in
Boston. So our position has been vindicated by one court of
appeals,'' said Shannon.
   Justice Department official said Tuesday's ruling will apply only
to states within the 8th Circuit. A Guard official in Washington
said no decision had been made on whether to appeal.
   The amendment was attached to the Defense Authorization Act of
1987 by Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss. Prior to its passage
in 1986, state units could not be sent on federal training missions
without a governor's consent.
   The 8th Circuit concluded that the Montgomery Amendment
contravenes the intent of the framers of the U.S. Constitution, who
they said designed the militia _ or National Guard _ ``to serve as a
check on the potential abuse of military power by the federal
government.''
   ``...The government has not demonstrated that the effectiveness
of either the national defense or the National Guard will be
diminished by adherence to the constitutional principle of basic
state control over National Guard forces, absent a declaration of
war or national exigency,'' the 8th Circuit majority held.
   The opinion was released in St. Paul and at the court's
headquarters in St. Louis.
   The amendment violates the plain language of the Constitution, is
at odds with declarations of the U.S. Supreme Court and ``departs
from an unbroken pattern of congressional deference to reserved
state authority'' over the National Guard which is embodied in the
militia clauses of the Constitution, the court said.
   Perpich was vacationing in Hawaii, but his office issued a
statement from him: ``From the beginning, this has been a state's
rights issue. The Montgomery amendment went too far in tipping the
balance of power toward the federal government.''
   At the Defense Department in Washington, National Guard Bureau
spokesman Dan Donohue said the ruling suggests further legal action
is likely. ``But no decisions have been made officially on an
appeal,'' he said.
   Donohue said the ruling in the Minnesota case would have little
immediate effect.
   ``From our point of view, the training of the National Guard
continues to be our primary responsibility. And the Montgomery
Amendment is still the law of the land except in the affected case
(Minnesota). We will continue to deploy and train soldiers in
accordance with the federal law.''
   Amy Brown, a spokeswoman for the Department of Justice in
Washington, said the only states covered by the ruling are the seven
in the 8th Circuit _ Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska
and North and South Dakota. However, she said, the ruling does not
take effect immediately and if the federal government appeals it
probably would be put on hold.
   About 115,000 men and women serve in the Air National Guard and
460,000 in the Army National Guard, Donohue said.
   The Pentagon is planning to send about 6,000 Guard members from
across the country to Honduras in 1989 for road-building and
engineering exercises, Donohue said. No such exercises are under way
because of the rainy season in Central America, he added.
   Capt. David Wirwahn, a spokesman for the Minnesota National
Guard, said Minnesota Guard members are scheduled for missions in
Panama from January through March. Perpich already has agreed to
those missions, he said.
   Montgomery said in a statement that giving governors veto power
over Guard missions ``would raise questions about the availability
of the Guard to meet its considerable defense responsibilities.''

   President Raul Alfonsin met with
his army commanders Wednesday and unconfirmed reports said Lt. Gen.
Dante Caridi, the chief of staff, would resign in a deal that
stopped the latest military revolt.
   In the four-day rebellion that ended Sunday, the third in 20
months, three military bases joined rebel leader Col. Mohamed Ali
Seineldin and several others refused to send troops against him.
   The 6th Mechanized Infantry Regiment at Mercedes, about 60 miles
west of Buenos Aires, remained in rebel hands Wednesday, apparently
because the Defense Ministry had not yet chosen a new commander.
   Maj. Hugo Avete, who rallied the base's estimated 100 soldiers
against two senior officers last weekend, ``is waiting to turn it
over to whoever the army chiefs send,'' a man who identified himself
as Avete's spokesman said in a telephone interview with The
Associated Press.
   Seineldin was questioned by a military judge. The 54-year-old
colonel was being held at a military garrison in Palermo, a northern
district of Buenos Aires. No details of the interrogation were
revealed.
   News reports, citing military sources they did not identify, said
Caridi's resignation was part of a deal under which Seineldin agreed
to end his revolt peacefully. The afternoon daily El Heraldo said
the high army command was deciding on Caridi's successor.
   Alfonsin has publicly expressed confidence in Caridi. After
Wednesday's meeting, presidential press secretary Jose Ignacio Lopez
said the general ``is and will continue'' to be the chief of staff.
   Caridi called a meeting of 28 generals and 16 colonels to
determine the situation in each of their commands and to help decide
which colonels would be promoted. Alfonsin met with the same group
later Wednesday at Government House, where he has his office.
   The meetings were to resume Thursday, the army chief's office
said in a communique.
   Carlos Menem, the opposition Peronist Party's candidate for
president in national elections set for May, said in an interview
with the independent agency Noticias Argentinas he was certain the
government made concessions to the rebels.
   ``The president said Sunday night there had been no type of
negotiation, and now he says there were two hours of talks,'' Menem
said. ``It seems that one of the conditions was the departure of
Caridi.''
   Defense Minister Horacio Jaunarena addressed the Senate in closed
session Wednesday for almost three hours. Members of the Peronist
Party asked that he explain how the insurrection was ended.
   Rebels had demanded an end to the prosecution of officers for
human rights abuses in 1976-83, during the so-called ``dirty war''
on leftists by military governments. At least 8,900 people
disappeared and are presumed dead, according to a commission
appointed by Alfonsin's civilian government.
   The rebels also demanded major changes in the defense hierarchy
and a bigger military budget.

   His summitry completed, Mikhail S. Gorbachev took
a 75-minute motorcade tour of Manhattan on Wednesday from the
canyons of Wall Street to garish Times Square, twice jumping out of
his limousine to greet astonished and delighted crowds.
   Though traffic was light most of the day, the dreaded
``Gorbylock'' arrived late in the afternoon once the 45-car
motorcade began snaking through the city.
   Traffic was locked up in lower Manhattan for about an hour after
the Soviet leader left the World Trade Center, where he and his
wife, Raisa, admired the view from the top of the 110-story twin
towers.
   At 50th Street and Broadway, just outside the Winter Garden
Theater, Gorbachev stopped his motorcade and jumped out to greet
people on the street.
   ``I was right there, and I yelled in Russian, `How are you,'''
said Geranno Valentine. ``He said, `Thank you, fine.'''
   ``The crowd was just going hysterical,'' said Joe Crawford, a
17-year-old high school student from Connecticut who had seen a
matinee of ``Starlight Express'' at a nearby theater. ``It was
fantastic, truly something fantastic to see someone like that up
close.''
   Gorbachev also briefly stepped out of his limousine at
Bloomingdale's, at Lexington Avenue and 59th Street, but despite
advance speculation that Mrs. Gorbachev planned a shopping
expedition, she remained in the car.
   The drive, which followed a luncheon meeting on Governors Island
with President Ronald Reagan and President-elect George Bush,
included glimpses of the New York Stock Exchange, Times Square with
its glitter and garbage, and busy 57th Street with Carnegie Hall and
the Russian Tea Room.
   All along the route, people gathered to get a glimpse at the
visiting dignitary. Crowds were thickest at Times Square, where the
scene resembled an early New Year's Eve gathering.
   At the World Trade Center, the entourage sped to the top of the
city's tallest building, standing nearly a quarter-mile high _ and
gazed out at the city's spectacular skyline as the sun was setting
into a bank of clouds.
   As the lights from skyscrapers around the city winked on, Mrs.
Gorbachev commented, ``How beautiful, how beautiful,'' said Port
Authority spokesman Mark Marchese. The group could see a distance of
25 miles.
   Marchese said Gorbachev asked where Kennedy Airport was and
picked out Governors Island by himself. When officials pointed out
the Empire State Building, the Soviet leader quipped that he had
heard of it.
   ``What I particularly liked about the city, is this is a unique
city, a city of splendid identity and architecture,'' Gorbachev said
in response to reporters' questions. ``You see different areas in
the city that have their own special identity.''
   ``We're very pleased by the fact that thousands of New Yorkers
have come out to see us,'' he added. ``We saw their faces, we saw
their eyes, their friendliness ... We are grateful for this warm
hospitality.''
   During the half-hour stop, Gorbachev endured a long speech by
Port Authority Chairman Philip Kaltenbacher. He appeared either
bored or tired and was seen several times twiddling his thumbs.
   The Soviet leader said his visit to the World Trade Center was
``symbolic'' because it serves as a center ``to promote
international economic and commercial cooperation.''
   Though he could have stopped in time to ring the closing 4 p.m.
bell at the New York Stock Exchange, Gorbachev's motorcade breezed
past the financial mecca.
   His long, black limousine, decked with a red Soviet flag on the
fender, slowed slightly as it turned onto Broad Street where the
exchange is located, just long enough for the crowd standing 10-deep
behind police barricades to proffer a hearty cheer.
   ``It looked like a new car show,'' said onlooker Brendan Murray,
27, an office manager for a brokerage firm. ``I hope he got a good
laugh out of it. He got half a hundred stock brokers to stand out
here for an hour and a half, and all we saw were his cuff links.''
   ``I just saw Gorbachev,'' a messenger said after the motorcade
had passed. ``I'll never wash my eyes again.''
   Times Square was ready _ with all its glitz, glitter and garbage,
for which there is no equivalent in the Soviet Union.
   The famous electronic billboard in the middle of Times Square
flashed a red hammer and sickle, with the message: ``Welcome,
General Secretary Gorbachev.''
   The greeting was sandwiched between advertisements for the movie,
``My Stepmother is an Alien'' and for U.S. News and World Report.
   XXX-rated movie theaters sported their usual fare, including
``Frisky Wives II.''
   ``This is the most exciting moment of my life, for two
superpowers to be in New York,'' said Lorenzo Hudson, a 23-year-old
security guard from Brooklyn.
   ``I'm supposed to be to work at 6 o'clock, but if I don't see
Gorby before then I won't go to work today.''
   Earlier in the day, the Gorbachevs toured the United Nations
where the Soviet leader addressed the world body.
   Outside the U.N. they were greeted by some 1,000 demonstrators
protesting conditions for Jews inside the Soviet Union, and
supporters of dissidents from the Baltic states, Ukrainians, Afghans
and Armenians.
   Some 56 people were arrested for crossing police barricades and
charged with disorderly conduct.
   Raisa Gorbachev did a little sightseeing of her own after an
afternoon luncheon with first lady Nancy Reagan and incoming first
lady Barbara Bush, visiting the Estee Lauder beauty shop on Fifth
Avenue.
   The city did not go to great lengths to spruce itself up for the
dignitaries' visit, other than to warn motorists to use mass
transit. For the most part, commuters listened.

   Palestinian leaders called for two days of
strikes starting Thursday in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
to mark the first anniversary of their uprising against Israeli rule.
   The conservative Hebrew daily Maariv said the army was increasing
forces in the territories in anticipation of trouble.
   Army officials declined Wednesday to comment on the report for
security reasons.
   ``So far it's business as usual,'' said an official, who cannot
be identified by name under military rules. ``We will respond in
accordance with the situation.''
   The ``intefadeh'' _ Arabic for uprising _ began Dec. 8, 1987 with
riots in the Jabaliya refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip after
an army truck collided with a van, killing four Palestinians. Rumors
had spread it was no accident and was instead revenge for the
stabbing death of an Israeli businessman three days earlier.
   A day after the riot, soldiers opened fire on protesting students
in the camp after a firebomb was hurled at an army patrol. Two
Palestinians were killed, the first of 319 to die in the yearlong
uprising. Eleven Israelis also have died in the violence.
   Israel has controlled the territories since it took Gaza from
Egypt and the West Bank from Jordan in the the 1967 Middle East war.
   On Wednesday, 10 Palestinians suffered gunshot wounds in
stone-throwing clashes with Israeli troops in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, Arab hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed six of the woundings.
   A soldier was hospitalized with a minor gunshot wound he suffered
while riding on a bus near the West Bank city of Hebron, the army
reported. The army spokesman's office said ``there is nothing to
indicate the bus was shot at'' and said the army was investigating
whether it involved the accidental discharge of another soldier's
weapon.
   In Ramallah, a firebomb was thrown at an Israeli military vehicle
but caused no damage or injuries, an army spokesman said. Arab
reporters said troops rounded up about 200 suspects for questioning,
but the army spokesman could not confirm this.
   The Defense Ministry announced it uncovered 93 guerrilla cells in
the past two months and arrested 610 members, most from the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin praised Israel's security forces
for their ``daring, determination and courage'' in uncovering the
groups, believed responsible for 87 anti-Israeli attacks in the past
year.
   ``These numbers speak for themselves; your success merits great
praise,'' Rabin wrote to the head of Shin Bet, Israel's secret
security agency.
   Among the attacks attributed to the groups is an Oct. 31 firebomb
assault on an Israeli passenger bus in the West Bank city of Jericho
that killed a woman and three of her children, the statement said.
   Also Wednesday, an army official said that a commander followed
proper procedures in the Monday shooting that killed a 15-year-old
Palestinian girl.
   Asma Abu Obadah of the Shati refugee camp in Gaza City, was hit
in the back of the head with a single plastic bullet. Witnesses said
she encountered soldiers trying to disperse a demonstration as she
walked home from school and that she panicked and ran.
   ``She was wounded after the soldiers shot in the air and warned
the demonstrators,'' the official said. ``The commander shot in the
direction of the demonstrators' legs, and a bullet hit her.''
   The strikes Thursday and Friday were announced in a leaflet
issued this week by the PLO-backed underground leaders of the
uprising.
   ``As the intefadeh enters its second year, we call on
Palestinians to strengthen the authority of the people as the
foundation stone for our future state _ more power to popular
(organizing) committees and the hit teams,'' the leaflet said.
   As darkness fell Wednesday in the crowded old market area of
Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, activists used loudspeakers to
read from the leaflet and to urge people to observe the Thursday and
Friday strikes. They began with the shouts ``Appeal! Appeal!
Appeal!'' then preceded the readings with the Islamic phrase ``In
the name of god, the compassionate.''
   Slogans painted on walls in Gaza City called for five minutes of
silence on Saturday ``in memory of the intefadeh martyrs,'' the term
for Palestinians killed in the uprising.
   In addition to the deaths, the army says 3,500 Palestinians have
been shot or severely wounded in the intefadeh. Others give much
higher figures, including the Palestinian human rights group Law in
the Service of Man, which estimates more than 20,000 people have
been shot, beaten or suffered tear gas inhalation.
   The Palestinians have lost millions in revenue by keeping their
shops and offices open only three hours a day and by closing
altogether for almost weekly general strikes. Israel's tourist
business has dropped by 14 percent and its construction industry,
dependent on Palestinian workers, also is suffering.
   According to army statistics, more than 5,600 Palestinians are in
Israeli prisons, about 1,500 of whom are held under ``administrative
detention'' without charge or trial. Thirty-two Palestinians have
been deported and 27 await deportation, government figures say.

<HEAD>Transportation Department Gives Nod to Airlines' Talks on O'Hare
Schedules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department gave the go-ahead
Wednesday for airlines using Chicago's O'Hare airport to jointly
propose schedule changes that might ease flight delays in and out of
Chicago.
   The department said it was granting a request by United Airlines
for temporary anti-trust immunity for such discussions as long as
any agreement is considered only a proposal to the Federal Aviation
Administration, which would take final action.
   ``We find that the discussions are necessary to mitigate the
delays at O'Hare for those delays would otherwise cause substantial
inconvenience for the traveling public,'' the department said.
   The number of flights are capped at O'Hare as they are at three
other busy airports around the country. But in early October, the
FAA imposed further restrictions, cutting the number of hourly
flights from 96 to 80 because of concerns that air traffic
controllers were being asked to handle too much traffic.
   The controllers handling aircraft in the Chicago area had
committed an unusually high number of errors this year. In late
November the maximum number of flights was increased slightly to 85
flights an hour.
   The discussions sought by United were aimed at getting all
airlines that use O'Hare to jointly juggle schedules and make other
adjustments that might reduce the delays caused by the new flight
restrictions.
   In October, arrival delays increased sharply over the previous
month at O'Hare. The DOT said 73.4 percent of the flights arrived on
time during the month, compared to 81.6 percent in September.
Departures left on time 83 percent of the time in October compared
to 87.1 percent in September.
   The department said that the airlines could begin their meetings
on Dec. 14 with the aim of providing ``guidance' to the FAA on ways
to reduce the delay problem.
   American Airlines and Air Canada had filed in support of the
discussions, while America West opposed them. Southwest Airlines had
asked that the discussions not result in any action that might
reduce the number of flights into Chicago's Midway airport.
   The DOT said the discussions ``would primarily concern'' the
conditions under which airlines could use their takeoff and landings
slots in and out of O`Hare. The airlines also will be able to
discuss possible scheduling adjustments to prevent too many flights
from being scheduled within short periods of time, the department
said.

<TEXT>
   Here are the comments made by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev during a ceremony at the World Trade Center
observatory Wednesday. He spoke after receiving gifts from officials
of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
   ``I thought we were here just as tourists, and that was nice to
be here as a tourist almost half a mile over New York.
   ``I'm very impressed by this city and by its architecture, its
bridges, by all that I've seen, the water. I've learned something
about the history of this city.
   ``I've been told about the history of the building of the
Brooklyn Bridge. The story of the building of this bridge is, in a
way, I think, similar to the story of the development of the great
expanse that is the United States.
   ``But one thing that I'd like to say is that it is certainly
symbolic that we are here in this building of the World Trade Center
that serves to promote international economic and commercial
cooperation.
   ``We have mentioned the Soviet fair that will be opening. I think
that political dialogue and political relations between our
countries should be supplemented by an expansion of our commercial
and economic ties. I think this is a very solid basis for a better
development of our relations.
   ``I think you have said quite appropriately that both our two
peoples share a desire to improve their relations. They both want to
know each other better.
   ``It is, I think, the task of political leaders to make policies,
to shape their policies, based on the will of their people. And this
is what I've tried to do today in my address to the United Nations.
   ``All Americans must know that our people deeply respect the
American people. All Americans should know that the Soviet people
want to cooperate with them. They want to have exchanges with them.
Our people want to live in peace with the Americans.
   ``I think we are now at the threshold, present at the birth of a
new phase in our relations, a phase that promises many good things
for both our nations.
   ``And this informal gathering, and the good atmosphere that I see
here is, I think, also a sign of the kind of change that we are
seeing in our relations. I'm sure that we can talk, that we can
discuss things and find solutions to any problem.
   ``Let me share with you some of the impressions about the meeting
I've just had with the president and vice president,
president-elect. It was a very open meeting, in a good atmosphere.
We shared the view that what we have been able to begin over these
years should be continued. This is very important.
   ``So I think our two peoples can look forward to good prospects.''

   President Reagan, taking a wait-and-see
attitude toward Mikhail S. Gorbachev's pledge to unilaterally reduce
conventional forces, declared Wednesday night that U.S. officials
must exercise caution as East-West dealings enter ``this critical
junction.''
   Reagan said he was pleased with the tone and substance of the
luncheon talks with his counterpart on Governors Island in New York
Harbor, but that ``fundamental differences between our countries
remain in many areas.''
   At the conclusion of their fifth and final summit, Reagan toasted
the Soviet president for ``what we together have accomplished and
what you and the vice president after Jan. 20 will accomplish
together.''
   Asked how the meeting had gone, Reagan replied: ``Read our
smiles.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the lunch was ``very
enjoyable'' and that the participants ``told a lot of stories.''
   Later, in a speech to the American Enterprise Institute, a
conservative think tank, the president said that freedom is on the
march around the world while totalitarianism is on the decline. And
he said: ``I am proud to say I am still an anti-communist.''
   ``And I continue to be dedicated to the idea that we must trumpet
our beliefs and advance our American ideals to all the peoples of
the world until the towers of the tyrants crumble to dust,'' Reagan
said.
   While applauding Gorbachev's announcement of a sweeping reduction
in Red Army ground forces, Reagan said he wants to see how well the
Kremlin follows through on that commitment.
   ``About the Soviet unilateral troop reduction, I can only say
that if it is carried out speedily and in full, history will regard
is as important _ signficant,'' he said.
   The president devoted only one sentence in a 4{-page speech to
the initiative that Gorbachev had announced hours earlier at the
United Nations in New York, although Reagan initially said that he
``heartily'' approved of the measure.
   President-elect George Bush, who joined Reagan and Gorbachev at
the luncheon table, declared that the Soviet decision was a good
one. ``You've got to look at the specifics, but the general idea of
a reasonably substantial unilateral reduction is fine,'' he said.
``There's no way that that can result in a balance of forces, but it
still is a step, so applaud it as a positive step.''
   U.S. officials said the slashing of 500,000 troops from the Red
Army would still leave the Soviets with a heavy advantage over the
NATO alliance in ground troop strength, where they already held a
roughly two-to-one edge.
   Gorbachev, talking to reporters before parting company with
Reagan and Bush, urged the United States to ``take certain steps''
in response to his announcement, but he did not elaborate on that
point.
   In his Wednesday night speech, Reagan went to great lengths to
defend the peace-through-strength foreign policy that he has pursued
over the last eight years.
   ``Let us remember, too, that at this critical junction, our
responsibilities grow more, not less serious,'' he said. ``We must
remain strong and free of illusion _ for only by doing so can we
reach out and embrace this new era and transform this hope of peace
and freedom for all the world into reality.''
   Reporting on his talks with Gorbachev, Reagan said, ``I think we
both expressed satisfaction in what we have achieved in recent
years. But we also recognized that fundamental differences between
our countries remain in many areas. And determined efforts by both
sides will be necessary in the months and years ahead to overcome
such differences.''
   ``Over the years, I've been described as an inveterate
optimist,'' he said. ``An eternal optimist, a reflexive optimist, a
born optimist, a canny optimist, a cagey optimist, even as
`defiantly optimistic.'''
   ``I am an optimist because I believe we have proved with our
policy of peace through strength that when we are strong, peace and
freedom will prevail,'' he said. ``This November, the electorate
told us they agreed.''

   First lady Nancy Reagan traveled to New York separately on
Tuesday and had lunch with Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, and about 20
other women while Reagan and Gorbachev were on the island.
   Reagan is expected to face questions about the meeting, as well
as other issues, Thursday night in what is likely to be his last
news conference as president.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow piled up Wednesday in northeastern Colorado, southeastern
Wyoming, the Nebraska Panhandle and parts of New Mexico as a winter
storm moved across the West toward Texas.
   Fort Collins, Colo., received 8 inches of snow by Wednesday
afternoon.
   Snow totals reported earlier Wednesday included more than 4
inches at Bellview, Colo., 4 inches at Sheridan, Wyo., and Dayton,
Wyo., and 3 inches at Lander, Wyo.
   At noon, 3 inches of snow had fallen at Alliance, Neb., and 2

   By early afternoon snow was falling from Montana across eastern
Idaho, eastern Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, western Kansas and western
Nebraska, as well as Upper Michigan. Rain showers extended from the
upper Texas Gulf Coast across southwest Missouri.
   Almost half an inch of rain fell at Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas,
during the 6 hours up to 1 p.m. EST.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 16
degrees at International Falls, Minn., and Warroad, Minn., to 84
degrees at McAllen, Texas. The low temperature for the nation
Wednesday morning was 9 degrees at Devils Lake, N.D.
   The national weather forecast for Thursday called for
temperatures to be much cooler from the northern and central

<TEXT>
   Entertainers and fans worldwide mourned the
death of rock 'n' roll legend Roy Orbison, describing the singer,
guitarist and songwriter as a seminal artist and a gentle man.
   Entertainers as diverse as Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, Billy
Joel, Emmylou Harris, Keith Richards and U2's Bono said Wednesday
that rock 'n' roll had lost one of its giants.
   The Grammy Award-winning Orbison, famed for such hits as ``Oh,
Pretty Woman,'' ``Only the Lonely'' and ``Crying,'' died of a heart
attack shortly before midnight Tuesday in a Nashville hospital. He
was 52.
   ``Sweet Roy. A gentleman and a gentle man. A good friend. His
death is a great loss to rock 'n' roll, but we still have his
music,'' said the Rolling Stones' Richards.
   ``He was and always will be one of the greats of rock 'n' roll,''
said former Beatle Paul McCartney. ``We toured with Roy in the early
days and he was a really good guy.''
   Instantly recognizable by his ever-present sunglasses and dark
attire, Orbison had 27 consecutive records on the charts during his
heyday in the early 1960s. Orbison's vocal range spanned three
octaves, and Elvis Presley once called him the greatest singer in
the world.
   ``He was as gentle, wise, and mysterious as his voice,'' said
U2's Bono, who recently recorded with Orbison in Memphis, Tenn.
   ``Starting over more than once, he was at the time of his death
the finest white pop singer on the planet. Writing a song for him
was like writing a song for Elvis Presley, the only other comparable
vocal talent,'' said Bono.
   Recently, Orbison became popular with still another generation of
fans as a member of The Traveling Wilburys _ along with ex-Beatle
George Harrison, Tom Petty, Bob Dylan and Jeff Lynne. The group's
album is No. 8 on the charts.
   Harrison and Petty said through publicists that they were too
stunned to comment immediately.
   Miss Harris, contacted on tour in Connecticut, described Orbison
as ``one of the greatest singers that ever lived. There will never
be another like him.'' In 1980 she collaborated with Orbison for
``That Loving You Feeling Again,'' which won a Grammy Award.
   Miss Ronstadt, who enjoyed great success with her rendition of
Orbison's ``Blue Bayou,'' said, ``I'm shattered. Roy was a
tremendous influence on the Los Angeles music community. I, the
Eagles, J.D. Souther were in awe of his artistry from our very
beginning.''
   ``He had the voice of an angel,'' said Billy Joel. ``His loss
with be felt by anyone who loves rock 'n' roll.''
   ``Roy Orbison was a great musician and a great friend to country
music. We have lost a giant,'' said Miss Parton.

   The strongest earthquake to hit the Soviet Caucasus
region in 80 years flattened buildings Wednesday and left thousands
homeless. One Soviet official said he received unconfirmed reports
of more than 200 people killed.
   A scientist at the seismic station in Yerevan, capital of the
republic of Armenia, said he visited the disaster area and estimated
the death toll probably would run into the thousands. But he
stressed the estimate was unofficial and declined to give his name.
   Official Soviet news media did not give any casualty figures.
Armenia was the hardest-hit area in the Caucasus.
   Deputy duty officer Lyova Oganisyan at the Interior Ministry in
Armenia said unconfirmed witness reports to police indicated more
than 200 people had been killed.
   An official of the Armenian government's office in Moscow, who
would not give his name, said the number of casualties was ``a very
big figure.''
   The quake, centered near the Soviet-Turkish border, killed at
least four people and caused extensive damage in eastern Turkey,
authorities said.
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., said the quake,
centered south of the Georgian capital of Tblisi, occurred at 11:41
a.m. (2:41 a.m. EST) and registered 6.9 on the Richter scale. A
quake of that magnitude is capable of causing widespread, heavy
damage.
   The temblor, followed by a moderate aftershock, struck a mountain
region in the Soviet Union already wracked by months of ethnic
violence between residents of Armenia and the neighboring republic
of Azerbaijan.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who was visiting the United
States, called the earthquake ``a grave tragedy.''
   State-run television, in an unusually prompt and detailed report
from the scene, showed film of crumbled buildings in Kirovakan,
Armenia's third largest city, and in Spitak, a regional center of
Armenia.
   Workers were shown picking up huge slabs of concrete amid the
rubble. Gold-colored curtains and beds protruded from the side of a
building where a wall once stood. In one dramatic shot, a man put
his hands over his head in grief as he stood amid a collapsed
building.
   ``The spontaneous elements didn't spare one-story or multistory
building,'' a TV correspondent said on the evening broadcast.
   Cars on the streets were crushed by falling concrete.
   The correspondent said thousands were homeless and that ``there
are casualties, injured,'' but neither he nor Soviet news reports
gave figures.
   ``In several regions of Armenia there is significant damage,
deaths and injuries,'' Tass said. ``The cities of Leninakan,
Kirovakan and also several others especially suffered.''
   Officials said communications had been cut off with Leninakan,
near where the quake was centered, and with much of the disaster
area. Leninakan, a city of 200,000 people, is 100 miles northwest of
Yerevan and close to the Soviet-Turkish border.
   They said the loss of communications complicated efforts to
assess the damage and casualties.
   Asked for the phone number of the police station in Spitak,
Oganisyan, the Interior Ministry official, said it wouldn't do any
good because the station was destroyed.
   He said casualty tolls are likely to run high because schools
were in session and factories were working.
   The government set up a commission to oversee rescue and salvage
operations and sent soldiers and civilian volunteers to the disaster
area, Tass said.
   The man who oversaw cleanup from the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant accident in April 1986, Deputy Premier Boris Y. Shcherbina,
visited the disaster area with Armenian Communist Party Chief Suren
Arutyunyan, television reported.
   State Turkish radio quoted the Kars provincial governor, Hasan
Fakir, as saying four residents of the town of Akyaka were killed in
the quake. Many houses were damaged in Akyaka and in the nearby
Cildir township, it said.
   The Kandilli observatory in Istanbul, reached by telephone, said
the quake shook four eastern Turkish provinces.
   Tass said the quake reached 9 on the 12-point Soviet scale, which
measures tremors on the basis of their visible effects. An
earthquake of 8 on the Soviet scale is described in Soviet reference
works as ``destructive,'' causing ``cracks on sharp slopes and in
wet soils. Monuments are moved or turned over. Houses are
considerably damaged.''
   The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was followed less
than five minutes later by a moderate aftershock, measuring 5.8 on
the Richter scale.
   The Moscow Central Seismic Center put the epicenter 30 miles from
Leninakan. It was felt in the Armenian capital of Yerevan, 95 miles
to the southeast, as well as in Georgia and Azerbaijan, Soviet TV
said.
   Because of violence between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, more than
180,000 refugees reportedly have fled across the border between
their two republics in the past three weeks. The earthquake is
likely to cause further dislocation.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.

<TEXT>
   Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, who has voiced
opposition to unilateral cuts in Red Army conventional forces,
resigned as military chief of staff Wednesday, the day Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced a cutback of 500,000 troops.
   Soviet foreign ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov confirmed
that Akhromeyev had resigned but said the marshal's decision was
based on poor health, and was not in protest of Gorbachev's move.
   ``He supported the proposals in the speech,'' Gerasimov said.
   Akhromeyev was among top Soviet generals who opposed a unilateral
reduction in the Kremlin's troop strength, arguing that the cuts
should be done simultaneously with reductions by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   ``For health reasons, he decided to retire,'' Gerasimov told a
news conference. ``It was merely a coincidence,'' he said of the
timing of the resignation.
   Gerasimov speculated that the unspecified health problems stemmed
from injuries Akhromeyev suffered in World War II.
   Akhromeyev will continue to serve as a military adviser to
Gorbachev, said Gerasimov.

   African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela was transferred Wednesday evening from a
clinic to live at a house on a prison farm outside Cape Town.
   Aside from stays in hospitals, it marked the first time since
1962 that the 70-year-old prisoner, South Africa's most widely known
black leader, has lived outside a cell.
   Prison officials said Mandela's wife, Winnie, children and
grandchildren would have unlimited access to Mandela at his new
quarters in a staff house on prison property. The one-story house
has a patio, flower garden and swimming pool.
   But Mrs. Mandela rejected the offer and said she will continue to
make the standard 40-minute visits to her husband until he is freed,
according to the family's lawyer, Ismail Ayob.
   The government has been under intense domestic and international
pressure to release Mandela unconditionally. But officials have
indicated that his outright release is not imminent and that
restraints on him will be eased in stages so the government can
assess the political impact of his possible freedom.
   Some opposition leaders criticized the government's move.
   Dullah Omar, a human rights lawyer who leads the banned United
Democratic Front, called the move ``utterly disgraceful and
callous.''
   ``What we were looking forward to was his release, not a transfer
from a clinic back to prison,'' he said.
   Zach de Beer, leader of the anti-apartheid Progressive Federal
Party, welcomed the transfer on humanitarian grounds but added:
``Unless Mr. Mandela is given the freedom to participate in the
political process of the country, he is denied the opportunity of
making his contribution towards the future.''
   The transfer was announced by Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee, who
said Mandela was moved to ``a suitable, comfortable and properly
secured home'' at the Victor Verster Prison in Paarl.
   Mandela has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life
sentence for plotting a sabotage campaign against the
white-controlled government.
   The outlawed ANC is the largest guerrilla organization fighting
the government and apartheid, South Africa's policy of racial
segregation.
   Mandela has rejected the government's repeated offers to release
him if he renounces violence or live in a tribal homeland. He has
said the government should renounce violence, end apartheid and
legalize the ANC.
   Last August, Mandela was diagnosed with tuberculosis and
transferred to a hospital from Cape Town's Pollsmoor Prison. Later,
he was moved to the Constantiaberg Clinic, a luxury private hospital
near Pollsmoor, and Coetsee announced on Nov. 24 that Mandela would
not be returned to Pollsmoor when his recuperation was complete.
   Ayob quoted Mrs. Mandela as saying that Mandela's transfer ``is
clearly a response to the domestic and international pressure for
his release.''
   ``I do not intend taking more than the normal 40-minute visit
I've been allowed in the past until all political prisoners have the
same privilege,'' she said in a statement provided by Ayob.
   ``South Africa is still under a state of emergency and there are
thousands of political prisoners and detainees, and large numbers of
leaders, organizations and the media remain restricted,'' Mrs.
Mandela said in the statement.
   There was no indication that other visitors, such as the media,
would be allowed access to Mandela.
   Mandela's transfer to a private home is one of a series of moves
by the government in the past two weeks aimed at easing
international pressure on South Africa.
   The government has given tentative approval to a peace pact that
would bring independence to Namibia, commuted the controversial
death sentences of six blacks known as the Sharpeville Six, and
freed two other prominent, long-serving black prisoners _ ANC leader
Harry Gwala and Zeph Mothopeng, president of the rival
Pan-Africanist Congress.
   But the government has given no indication that it is willing to
negotiate with freed black leaders on their demands for one-person,
one-vote democracy.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: into reality.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   So the meeting today was a time for reflection and for
continuity. Now let me do the same with you and consider how we've
done these last eight years and whether we've done well. And I do
mean ``we.''
   We have come a long way together _ from the intellectual
wilderness of the 1960s, through the heated intellectual battles of
the 1970s, to the intellectual fruition of the 1980s.
   The American Enterprise Institute stands at the center of a
revolution in ideas of which I, too, have been a part. Our ideas
were greeted with varying degrees of scorn and hostility by what we
used to call the ``establishment'' institutions.
   The universities, once the only real home for American
scholarships, have been particularly unresponsive. And so it became
necessary to create our own research institutions as places where
scholars could congregate and important studies could be produced
that did not kow-tow to the conventional wisdom. And your
institution's remarkably distinguished body of work is testimony to
the triumph of the think tank.
   For today, the most important American scholarship comes out of
our think tanks, and no think tank has been more influential than
the American Enterprise Institute. (Applause.)
   What we wanted was a chance to try our ideas out on the world
stage. We have. And my friends, I hope you're as proud as I,
because, despite the naysayers and the conventional wisdom, the
words of the pundits, and the false prophecies of false Cassandras
who proclaimed we could not succeed, we knew we were right.
   And I believe that, yes, we have been vindicated.
   And nowhere is that more true than in the realm of foreign
policy. We came to Washington together in 1981, both as
anti-communists and as unapologetic defenders and promoters of a
strong and vibrant America. I am proud to say I am still an
anti-communist _ (applause). And I continue to be dedicated to the
idea that we must trumpet our beliefs and advance our American
ideals to all the peoples of the world until the towers of the
tyrants crumble to dust.
   Yes, it seems to me that we've been as one these past eight years
in an effort to establish a foreign policy that stood in firm
opposition to the previous decade's misguided attempt to place this
country on what they used to call, in the 1970s, the ``right side of
history'' _ by which those who used that unpleasant Marxist phrase
meant we should accept the dominion of our adversaries over large
parts of the world.
   We said no. We said we must propound and advance our national
ideals abroad and once again hold high the banner for what I will,
until the breath is gone from my body, continue to call ``the free
world.'' (Applause.)
   We promulgated a foreign policy whose fundamental basis was the
truths all Americans hold to be self-evident: That all men are
created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with
unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.
   We have done this, not solely because we believe it is right, but
because we know it is in our national interest to do so.
   A foreign policy based on our bedrock principles allows us to
offer a practical solution to the suffering peoples of the world, a
means of achieving prosperity and political stability that all
Americans take for granted as their birthright.
   What we are telling them _ and their ofttimes recalcitrant
leaders _ is that they cannot achieve prosperity and stability
through redistribution of resources, or by taking up arms against a
sea of self-inflicted troubles.
   We've seen how that last monstrous idea has worked this decade _
the war between Iran and Iraq, whose initial aim was control over an
oil-rich province, has done more damage to both countries than 10
plagues.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
declared Wednesday that his government no longer holds political
prisoners and that it has applied strict time limits on the use of
state secrecy as a reason for refusing Jews permission to emigrate.
   Although Western observers generally acknowledge there has been a
dramatic reduction in the number of political prisoners since
Gorbachev rose to power, human rights groups still count about 150
people said to be held solely because of their political or
religious beliefs.
   Gorbachev promised ``the problem of exit from and entry to our
country, including the question of leaving it for family
reunification, is being dealt with in a humane spirit.'' But he gave
no indication the Soviet Union is prepared to open its borders to
unrestricted travel or emigration.
   ``In places of confinement, there are no persons convicted for
their political or religious beliefs,'' the Soviet leader told the
United Nations General Assembly. But he added that his statement did
not apply to ``those who committed actual criminal offenses or state
crimes such as espionage, sabotage, terrorism, et cetera., whatever
their political or ideological beliefs.''
   Secretary of State George Shultz said the Soviet Union has
released a ``great many'' political prisoners, but such people still
exist. Differences of opinion exist on whether a person is in prison
because of his political views or because of a violation of law, he
said.
   But Shultz said he thought it possible to a construct a procedure
in which ``we will go through with them name-by-name the people on
our list'' to determine whether a person should be released.
   The United States and human rights groups have focused attention
on two Soviet laws Gorbachev didn't mention specifically but which
make it a crime to slander the Soviet state or engage in anti-Soviet
agitation. The Soviets have indicated they will modify or eliminate
those statutes in a rewrite of their criminal code now under way.
   Nobel Laureate Andrei Sakharov, the well-known Soviet dissident
whom Gorbachev released from internal exile two years ago, contends
that an unspecified number of Soviets remain in prisons or labor
camps for their political or religious views.
   ``One of the reasons for refusal to leave is a person's knowledge
of secrets,'' Gorbachev told his audience. ``Strictly warranted time
limitations on the secrecy rule will now be applied. ... This
removes from the agenda the problem of the so-called `refuseniks.'''
Refusenik is a journalists' term used to describe Soviets, usually
Jews, who have been refused permission to emigrate.
   Alexander Yakovlev, a member of the Communist Party's ruling
Politburo and a top adviser to Gorbachev, told an American peace
coalition after the speech that he does not believe ``that there are
any serious obstacles to those who want to emigrate.''
   He said ``the process of disarmament'' has not reached a stage at
which it is possible to let those with military secrets leave the
country, but Yakovlev contended there are fewer than 46 such cases
remaining.
   ``This is unfortunate,'' he added, ``but it is another motivation
to disarm.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov claimed, ``This
is a problem that has disappeared'' with the establishment of an
appeal procedure to permit review of refuseniks' cases.
   Jerry Strober, a spokesman for the National Conference on Soviet
Jewry, told The Associated Press after Gorbachev's speech that his
group has documented 1,987 Soviet Jewish families who have been
refused exit visas for more than five years, a significant number of
whom have been told they were not permitted to leave because they
once had access to state secrets.
   Strober noted that Gorbachev said four years ago no one would be
held more than 10 years for having had access to secrets. But at
least 512 of those still on the conference's list have waited more
than 10 years for permission to leave, he said.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, has said in recent weeks it has information on 150
Soviets ``imprisoned solely for the nonviolent exercise of their
fundamental human rights.''
   And a lay Roman Catholic organization called Puebla Institute
counts 156 Soviets it says are jailed for their religious beliefs.
The two lists overlap but are not identical.

<HEAD>California Court Allows Some Auto Insurance Provisions to Take
Effect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California's Supreme Court agreed Wednesday
to hear insurers' lawsuits challenging the Proposition 103 rate
reduction initiative, but allowed immediate enforcement of all major
provisions except a 20 percent rollback in auto insurance rates.
   The portions of the measure that the court allowed to take effect
will force companies to base insurance rates primarily on a driver's
record and experience and repeal an exemption from state antitrust
laws for insurance companies.
   Harvey Rosenfield, chairman of Voter Revolt and author of the
measure, said he was disappointed that the court did not also allow
the rate rollback. But he said he was excited that some provisions
will take effect.
   One insurance industry official said he was disappointed that the
court's prior stay on the entire measure had been modified at all
but said it was a positive sign that the court had blocked the
rollback provision.
   ``At first blush, we're pleased that the court will hear our
arguments, but we feel the briefing schedule is more relaxed than
we'd like,'' said John Kozero, a spokesman for Fireman's Fund
Insurance Cos. ``No date has been set for a hearing, and we hoped
for a speedy resolution to the case.''
   The justices indicated they would not hear oral arguments until
February. The court voted 6-1 to hear the case, with Justice Stanley
Mosk dissenting.
   Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who is defending the measure
in court, called the court's action ``the first step toward full
implementation of Proposition 103.''
   The court had blocked implementation of Proposition 103 on Nov.
10, two days after voters approved it. It was the only one of five
insurance-related initiatives to pass.
   In Wednesday's order, the court left its stay in place for only
two of the measure's numerous provisions.
   One, which is the central target of the lawsuits, would reduce
motor vehicle and property insurance rates 20 percent below November
1987 levels, and freeze them until November 1989. The only
exemptions would be for insurers that could show a ``substantial
threat of insolvency.''
   The insurance companies' lawsuits contend the rollback and freeze
are an unconstitutional confiscation of the insurers' property
because they do not take into account a company's continued ability
to make a profit.
   The other provision that remains blocked would require mailing of
notices to announce the formation of a nonprofit corporation to
advocate the interests of insurance consumers. Insurers contend the
corporation violates restrictions in the California Constitution.
   The provisions that will be allowed to take effect include a
requirement that auto insurance rates be based primarily on a
driver's record and experience, rather than place of residence; a
ban on cancellation or non-renewal of auto policies except for
failure to pay, fraud, or an increase in the risk; and a repeal of
the insurance industry's exemption from state antitrust laws.
   The court's order appeared to support the position of the state
attorney general and private sponsors that a stay of all portions of
the measure was excessive because most do not threaten the companies
with any immediate, measurable financial harm.
   The insurers' lawsuits did not attack all provisions of
Proposition 103 but argued that the entire initiative should be
thrown out if the rate rollback and freeze are declared
unconstitutional.

   Barbara Bush injected a bit of levity Wednesday
into an exclusive U.N. luncheon for sometime-rivals Raisa Gorbachev
and Nancy Reagan, putting the first ladies at ease in their final
official meeting.
   ``It was very pleasant, very lovely, lots of smiling,'' said one
of the luncheon guests in attendance _ New York Post gossip
columnist Aileen Mehle, better known as ``Suzy.''
   Marcela Perez de Cuellar, the wife of the United Nations
secretary-general, hosted the lunch at her posh East Side home for
the first ladies, Mrs. Bush and 20 New York socialites, including
cosmetics manufacturer Estee Lauder.
   ``I'm happy to be here in this city you call `The Big Apple,'''
Mrs. Gorbachev told reporters, saying the words the big apple in
English. Aides to her husband, Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, had said he wanted to ``take a bite out of the Big
Apple'' during his three-day stay here.
   As photographers urged the first ladies, Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Perez
de Cuellar to smile for pictures before lunch, Mrs. Gorbachev said,
``We can't see you. That's why we don't smile.''
   ``How do you say `cheese' in Russian?'' Mrs. Bush quipped as the
four women posed.
   Mrs. Bush, using her wit and good humor, seemed intent on
defusing any problems at the gathering between the two first ladies,
who have had their run-ins on previous occasions in the past three
years.
   As the translator interpreted the word ``cheese'' for Mrs.
Gorbachev and Mrs. Bush, the group broke out in smiles and laughter.
   The first ladies and the 20 women dined in an elegant room with a
marble fireplace, crystal chandelier and tall windows overlooking
the East River. Each place was set with crystal bearing the U.N.
insignia and at every place setting lay a small present wrapped in a
peach bow.
   A table seat plan showed Mrs. Perez de Cuellar had put Mrs.
Gorbachev on her right and Mrs. Reagan on her left. Mrs. Bush was
seated next to Mrs. Gorbachev.
   The two first ladies exchanged verbal invitations with Mrs.
Gorbachev inviting the Reagans to the Soviet Union and Mrs. Reagan
asking the Soviet first couple to visit them in California after
they leave the White House in January.
   Elaine Crispen, Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman, said that when Mrs.
Reagan returned to Washington her husband told her that he, too, had
invited the Gorbachevs to California.
   ``They both said they'd like the Gorbachevs to see the West as
well as the East since they are totally different,'' Mrs. Crispen
said.
   In the ``very animated conversation,'' Mrs. Gorbachev discussed
her husband's efforts to open Soviet society with his policy of
glasnost and she added that they would like to see all nations
opened, according to Ms. Mehle.
   Mrs. Reagan responded that the United States was ``indeed open,''
but the two women did not argue the point, Ms. Mehle said.
   After the lunch, Mrs. Reagan was asked how everything went as she
departed in a limousine with Mrs. Bush. ``Fine, fine,'' she told
reporters.
   Mrs. Gorbachev wore a navy suit with a thin banker's stripe. Mrs.
Reagan wore a rust and brown suit with a silk scarf at her neck,
while Mrs. Bush chose a purple plaid suit and what appeared to be a
gold medal on her shoulder with a U.S. seal.
   Prior to lunch, Mrs. Bush surprised Christmas shoppers with a
stop at Tiffany's on Fifth Avenue.
   ``We're not shopping,'' she called out with a smile as customers
stopped to wish her well. Mrs. Bush made a quick stop at the store
to have her watch repaired, a store spokeswoman said.
   Surrounded by Secret Service agents, Mrs. Bush spoke briefly with
those who stopped to congratulate her on her husband's election
victory and signed an autograph for Joshua Steinberg, 9, of Brooklyn.
   During her U.N. tour with Mrs. Perez de Cuellar, the Soviet first
lady had appeared to be somewhat tired.
   While they posed for photographers at lunch, Mrs. Reagan told how
Mrs. Gorbachev had seemed immune to jet lag during an earlier trip
to Washington. ``She never looks tired,'' Mrs. Reagan said.
   ``We want your secret,'' demanded Mrs. Bush, evoking a round of
giggles and smiles from the women.
   The Soviet first lady's itinerary Wednesday also included a visit
to the Estee Lauder cosmetic headquarters and an tour by car of
Manhattan with her husband.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Reagan pooh-poohed reports that she and Mrs.
Gorbachev had feuded in the past. She said she intended to wish the
Soviet first lady _ an avowed Marxist-Leninist and atheist _ a merry
Christmas.
   Mrs. Gorbachev, during her U.N. tour, strolled with Mrs. Perez de
Cuellar through the modern glass and steel building, pausing to chat
repeatedly and look at many of its international artworks. She wore
a gray suit and aqua blouse.
   Mrs. Perez de Cuellar, attired in a green and black
Harlequin-like suit ruffled at neck and cuff, explained several of
the works that have been donated to the international organization
by member nations.
   Mrs. Gorbachev noted that the Soviets intended to donate a bronze
sculpture later in the day.
   ``We like you,'' someone called out from the crowd, a comment met
by smiles on the part of Mrs. Gorbachev.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with Toepfer quote on Biblis
accident possibly getting out of control, possibility of
investigation. Pick up 6th pvs, `Biblis operators...'</NOTE>

   Opposition politicians said Wednesday
that economic pressure may have led officials to cover up a nuclear
accident a year ago at a reactor in central West Germany.
   In the northern part of the country, officials said another
nuclear accident occurred nearly seven months ago. They said
investigators are determining whether the utility took too long to
report that incident.
   In Parliament, Federal Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer told a
committee there is an ``urgent need'' to better inform people about
nuclear accidents, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl demanded a ``complete
explanation'' of the Dec. 16-17 Biblis accident.
   The just-disclosed incident at Biblis nuclear power plant in
Hesse state has prompted charges of an attempted cover-up from
opposition parties and environmentalists.
   Toepfer has said he did not hear about the accident until Oct. 12.
   ``Under improbable but thinkable circumstances, the reactor could
have fallen into a state that would have been difficult to
control,'' he said.
   Marlene Muehe, his spokeswoman, said Wednesday that the
government may review the reliability of the utility that operates
the Biblis plant, Rheinisch-Westfaelische Elektrizitaetswerke. But
she did not say what such a review could lead to.
   Biblis operators allowed a malfunctioning valve to go uncorrected
for 15 hours, and a small amount of radioactive steam was released
into the atmosphere when they finally tried to rectify the problem.
   Environmentalists allege the accident could have led to a
meltdown of the Biblis reactor core. But energy officials insist the
plant has emergency systems to prevent this.
   The incident was disclosed this week by the American nuclear
industry newsletter, ``Inside the NRC.'' NRC is a reference to the
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   Federal legislator Klaus Lennartz suggested ``economic pressure''
to keep the plant open may have played a role in any cover-up. The
disclosure has prompted widespread demands that authorities shut
down the reactor.
   Closing down an atomic power plant costs $570,000 per day,
Lennartz told reporters. ``Atomic energy personnel are under
tremendous economic pressure,'' he said.
   The utility company operating Biblis plant,
Rheinisch-Westfaelisches Elektrizitaetswerk, denies it tried to
conceal information.
   ``The utility notified not only the authorities, but also the
residents in the area,'' said company spokesman Heinz-Josef Franken.
   Lower Saxony state officials, meanwhile, said a leak occurred at
the atomic power plant in Stade city May 27 and the incident was not
reported for three days.
   State officials said the incident was given an ``urgent'' rating
_ the same as Biblis _ but they have not further described what
happened.
   Preussenelektra, the utility that runs the Saxony plant,
acknowledged the incident but said no radioactivity escaped from the
plant and there was never any serious danger to the public.
   A company statement said a valve in the non-nuclear part of the
plant failed but was repaired quickly.
   Werner Hemmer, environment minister for Lower Saxony state, said
state officials did not hear of the accident until three days later.
   But the company denied trying to hide the incident and also
rejected charges that reactor operators took too much time shutting
down the plant.
   Guenther Jansen, energy minister in Schleswig-Holstein state, has
charged that Stade operators did not shut down the reactor until
ordered to by federal inspectors.
   Stade is 15 miles west of Hamburg and Biblis is 30 miles south of
Frankfurt in the heavily populated Rhine River valley.

   WASHINGTON: 10 plagues.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   No, we have told the world the truth we have learned from the
noble tradition of Western culture, and that is that the only answer
to poverty, to war, to oppression is one simple word: Freedom.
   Now, freedom is not only a moral imperative for our foreign
policy, it's also _ if I may use a word for which few in this room
have much use _ supremely pragmatic. For if there is anything the
world has learned in the 1980s, it is that, as Alan Keyes has said,
freedom works.
   That is a historic lesson, because until very recently many
intellectuals believed to the contrary. They supported political
philosophies that argued for tyranny, and more particularly,
communist tyranny.
   The claim was that these tyrannies worked better than freedom and
were more equitable. These intellectuals believed that the people of
Mao's China, Ho's Vietnam, Castro's Cuba, and other socialist
utopias were actually happy to sacrifice their freedom for food and
shelter and so-called literacy programs.
   These noxious ideas have not, to put it mildly, withstood the
scrutiny of honest scholars and the testimony of those fortunate
enough to escape from those national prison camps.
   Refugees have told us what diligent researchers at AEI were
meticulously demonstrating _ that where there is little freedom,
there is little food. That where there is totalitarian
indoctrination instead of education, literacy programs are a form of
spiritual and psychological coercion. That in these countries,
infant mortality is shockingly high and is getting worse. That the
poverty-stricken tyrannies of the 1980s have only grown poorer and
poorer. That tyranny is a parasite that saps the strength of a
nation in its sway. That, like those who lived under Macbeth's
tyranny, the tyrannized millions will ever cry out: ``Our country
sinks beneath the yoke _ it weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a
gash is added to her wounds.''
   Tyranny fails. Freedom works. These facts, so little accepted
only a decade ago, are now indisputable. There is little need here
to rehearse the evidence in great detail.
   The tiny free-exchange experiments in the East bloc and the
liberalization in the People's Republic of China are stunning
evidence of the communist world's desperate efforts to find a way
out of the economic morass of state socialism.
   At the same time, the abject failure of the Sandinistas in
Nicaragua _ a nation where the standard of living has dropped
precipitously since the 1979 revolution _ is stark proof of
communism's inherent inability to compel an enslaved population to
do much of anything but suffer.
   I know it is often said of me that I am an optimist.
   Over the years I've been described as an inveterate optimist, an
eternal optimist, a reflexive optimist _ (scattered laughter) _ a
born optimist, a canny optimist, a cagey optimist, even as, quote,
``defiantly optimistic,'' unquote. (Laughter.)
   It just goes to show, there is no word that cannot be turned into
a pejorative if the pundits work hard enough at it. (Laughter,
applause.)
   But yes, I am perfectly happy to admit that I am an optimist, and
I would like to explain why I believe _ in contrast to some of you
here tonight _ that optimism is an appropriate attitude to bring to
bear when thinking about our foreign policy.
   The story of this century is actually two stories. It's a
terrible story of world wars, totalitarian enslavement,
concentration camps. But it is also the story of freedom _ the
fulfillment of the promise of freedom inside the United States and
the triumph of democratic systems in Western Europe, Japan, Israel,
El Salvador, and many other places.
   We have seen the thrilling spectacle of mankind refusing to
accept the shackles placed upon us when we read the works of
Solzhenitsyn and Valladares, consider the heroism of Sharansky and
Sakharov, and watch in wonder these last months as hundreds of
thousands throughout the captive nations gather to press for freedom.
   Now, one may, if one chooses, take the first story as the
representative tale of the 20th century. Well, I look to the second,
and find glorious examples of what freedom can bring.
   I think of how astonishing it is that Italy and Germany and
Japan, three nations that engaged us in a struggle literally to the
death, have in just two score become our brethren, our friends.
   The nations of Western Europe, which existed in a state you might
call ``cold war'' for most of the past millennium with periods of
real war thrown into the bargain, are now the best of friends and
are on the verge of creating the world's largest free market.
   Latin America, once a despot's paradise, is now 90 percent
democratic. The brave people of El Salvador have faced down those
who would still their voices by turning out to vote in great number.
   In the Far East, democracy has taken unprecedented strides in
such countries as South Korea and the Philippines.
   Freedom works, and freedom is on the march, and yes, I am an
optimist, and yes, I believe I have every reason to be.
   I am an optimist because we are rapidly developing the means to
neutralize the extraordinary threat of nuclear missiles through our
Strategic Defense Initiative.
   I an an optimist because I believe that we have proved with our
policy of peace through strength that when we are strong, peace and
freedom will prevail.
   This November, the electorate told us they agreed.
   But while I believe that optimism is appropriate, and while I
believe that freedom is on the march, I believe optimism must be
tempered with prudence and its assumptions challenged every waking
moment of every day.
   The new democracies around the world are fragile, and inattention
to their fragility and their needs may result in the end of freedom
there.
   In Central America, our policy of peace through strength has been
undercut by a wavering Democrat-controlled Congress that seems less
concerned about the threat of a consolidated Marxist-Leninist regime
in Nicaragua than the possibility of scoring points against a policy
so closely associated with our administration.
   And yes, I still believe the noble freedom fighters who have been
battling for the soul of their homeland continue to be the best hope
for freedom and democracy in Nicaragua. (Applause.)
   I am troubled by something else, as well.
   The 1980s have been the glory years of the NATO alliance. The
Soviet deployment of intermediate-range missiles presented NATO with
its greatest challenge since the construction of the Berlin Wall,
and the alliance not only survived, but was vindicated by the
signing of the INF Treaty in Washington one year ago tomorrow.
   The NATO alliance is the best example we have to show the less
fortunate peoples of the world how freedom and democracy create
friendship and comity between peoples and nations.
   But 40 _ (scattered applause) _ but 40 years after the North
Atlantic Treaty, there are still some who question the Alliance.
Thus we hear, just months after the destruction of the first
intermediate-range missile, that somehow the United States is being
mistreated by our friends and allies.
   The argument they use is that our allies are not sharing their
burden of their own defense equitably.
   I agree that our NATO allies could be sharing the burden better.
But we must also solve our economic disputes more fairly.
   But we must always remember the very real burden our allies bear
that we never will. We must remember our allies perform a role that
geography has forced upon them.
   They are literally on the front lines for the West. Our fortunate
geography has kept the wars of the 20th century well away from the
American mainland, but in Europe, the memory is as fresh as the
memories of a 50-year-old and the tales of a grandfather.

   Their soldiers, their children, their homes, their civilization
itself hang in the balance every day. We cannot, we must not, forget
this. And we should not give in to the temptation to transmute a
small difference in a historic relationship into a major
disagreement that might end up damaging the greatest foreign-policy
success of the post-war era.
   I believe we can and will make progress on these matters as long
as we hold true to our principles and do not give up the battle.
   Now, I would like to ask those of you in this room who consider
yourselves foreign policy skeptics to do me one last favor. I want
to ask you to remain vigilant.
   You are the people who play the vital role of reminding
politicians and policy-makers of many important and necessary truths
we sometimes forget.
   It's true that sometimes you can't see the forest for the trees;
indeed, sometimes you can't even see the trees for the grass that
surrounds them.
   So please, for George Bush's sake and for the sake of all we hold
dear, please keep watching the forest.
   I take my leave of you now by offering a final prayer that God
may bless and keep all of you all the days of your life. Thank you
and good night. (Applause.)

   A woman opened fire in a battered women's shelter
Wednesday, killing a shelter worker, wounding two other people and
barricading herself in a room for 90 minutes before police persuaded
her to give up.
   Denver police said Juanita Whitaker, 40, surrendered at the
Brandon Center after an officer convinced her she would not be
harmed and promised to buy her some hair curlers that she wanted.
   When the shooting began, mothers grabbed their small children and
ran out into the falling snow without taking time to put on coats.
About 35 to 40 people were in the shelter at the time, said Dianna
Kunz, president of Volunteers of America Colorado Branch, which
operates the center.
   Whitaker was being held in the Denver City Jail without bond for
investigation of first-degree murder. She was scheduled to be
arraigned Thursday.
   Police identified the dead woman as Jeannie Archuleta, 24, of
Denver, who had begun work at the shelter less than two months ago.
   Two people were in serious condition at Denver General Hospital,
said hospital spokeswoman Lisa Duchon. Ken Sanchez, 29, a shelter
counselor, was shot in the abdomen. A 31-year-old woman who was not
identified because she was a shelter client suffered a leg wound.
   Police spokeswoman Anne Montoya said Whitaker was despondent over
personal problems and soon was going to have to leave the shelter,
where she had lived since Nov. 18.
   Kunz said clients can remain at the shelter up to 90 days but did
not know whether Whitaker had been told to leave. She said the woman
had spent time at the shelter a year ago.
   Police said Whitaker also had been upset about the handling of a
sexual assault complaint she had lodged Nov. 23. Police said there
had not been enough evidence to bring charges in the alleged
incident, which occurred at a friend's house.
   Sgt. Phil Dinan, who persuaded the woman to surrender, said, ``I
would say it was a personal problem. She was very worried about not
having hair curlers _ and I offered to buy her some. ... I'm not
sure what her total grasp of reality is.''
   Whitaker's roommate at Brandon Center said Whitaker became
agitated when she was unable to see a counselor Wednesday morning.
   ``The next thing we knew she got mad because the counselor wasn't
there,'' said the roommate. ``She decided to go out and shoot
people.''
   Whitaker apparently opened fire with a pistol in the shelter's
foyer about 8:45 a.m. and then barricaded herself in a basement
room, police said.
   Despite being shot in the abdomen, Sanchez managed to telephone
police.
   Police closed off a three-block area around the shelter during
the standoff.
   Kunz said guns or any other weapons are forbidden inside the
center, which VOA has operated at one site or another for 92 years.
Police had not determined when Whitaker brought the weapon into the
shelter.
   The center's 70 to 75 residents were sent to other shelters
pending completion of the police investigation.

   The city's communist officials
agreed tentatively to allow an independent rally, which they have
not done since reform leader Alexander Dubcek was ousted in 1969,
dissident leaders said Wednesday.
   One activist, Jiri Dienstbier, said rally organizers and city
officials reached a provisional accord Wednesday to allow a
demonstration marking Saturday as the 40th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
   Dienstbier, who belongs to the Charter 77 human rights movement,
said authorities were expected to make a final decision Thursday.
``It looks as if it is permitted,'' he said.
   If the gathering takes place without police interference, it
would be the first time in nearly 20 years that independent groups
gained permission for a rally in Prague. In 1969, authorities ousted
Dubcek in the wake of a Soviet-led invasion provoked by his reforms,
known as the ``Prague Spring.''
   Another Charter 77 source, who spoke on conditon of anonymity,
called the tentative approval of a demonstration ``a small step'' by
authorities toward engaging independent groups in dialogue.
   Authorities told organizers Tuesday that the demonstration will
not be permitted as requested in Prague's central Wenceslas Square,
the sources said.
   But Charter 77 member Milos Hajek said he and two other group
members went Wednesday to Prague's municipal government to discuss
an alternative location.
   The other Charter 77 source who spoke on condition of anonymity
said a second discussion with authorities later Wednesday resulted
in a tentative agreement for a demonstration in a small square about
a mile from the center of Prague.
   Saturday's demonstration was called by the Charter 77 movement;
the Committee for the Unjustly Prosecuted, known as VONS; The
Movement for Civil Freedom; the Independent Peace Association; and
Czech Children.
   Authorities banned a rally called by the same five groups on Oct.
28, the 70th anniversary of Czechoslovakia's independence. About
5,000 people defied the ban by gathering in Wenceslas Square, but
police dispersed them with batons, dogs, tear gas and water cannons.
   Police also put down a demonstration on Aug. 21 after about
10,000 people marched through Prague to mark the 20th anniversary of
the Soviet-led invasion of 1968.
   Saturday's demonstration is planned to coincide with a two-day
visit beginning Thursday by French President Francois Mitterrand. He
plans to meet with several leading dissidents Friday.
   Back in Paris on Saturday, French authorities have planned their
own celebrations of the human rights anniversary. Lech Walesa,
leader of Poland's banned Solidarity labor movement, is scheduled to
attend.

<HEAD>$66 Million Settlement by 100 Firms to Clean Up Suburban Waste Dump</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 companies that dumped hazardous
waste into a suburban landfill agreed Wednesday to a $66 million
settlement of a federal lawsuit to clean up one of the nation's
worst toxic dumps.
   The agreement, filed as a consent decree with the lawsuit in
federal court, addresses a decade of concerns over the 190-acre
Operating Industries Inc. landfill in Monterey Park, which took
municipal and industrial waste between 1948 and 1984.
   Dan McGovern, regional administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, said the settlement was one of the largest ever
achieved by the agency and a ``landmark'' for the federal Superfund
cleanup program.
   ``The decree represents a significant commitment by the 119
participating companies to clean up the contamination for which they
are responsible and to thereby protect the health and restore the
environment,'' he said.
   The settlement outlined by U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner and other
officials at a news conference calls for $32 million in payments
from some settling defendants and $34 million worth of cleanup work
from others.
   About 190 companies are responsible for 80 percent of the waste
put into Operating Industries, McGovern said, and the government
will begin issuing administrative orders to compel action by those
that didn't settle.
   The settling companies will build a plant to treat leachate,
liquid moving through the ground, to prevent contamination of water
supplies around the dump, which is 10 miles east of downtown and
surrounded by 53,000 residences.
   Neighbors have complained for years of health problems they
believe stem from the dump, which is bisected by the Pomona Freeway.
One side is a 150-foot mound of solid waste and the other is a flat
area where liquids were dumped.
   ``We think that it's a long time coming,'' said Hank Yoshitake, a
representative of Homeowners to Eliminate Landfill Problems, which
represents 460 families living in the neighborhood.
   The EPA has identified wastes buried there as including such
toxins as benzene and vinyl chloride.
   Dr. Kenneth Kizer, director of the California Department of
Health Services, said the site is a cauldron for potential health
problems for the community, but there is no indication that those
problems have come.
   Settling companies included the petroleum, aerospace, airline,
food products, steel and paint industries.
   The Superfund Act imposes liability for hazardous waste cleanup
costs on those who sent material to dumps, even if they did so
legally.
   Sixty of the settling companies have formed the OII Steering
Committee to undertake the cleanup. Committee chairman Jeff
Zimmerman lauded the agreement.
   ``The settlement embraces fully the spirit of the Superfund law
in bringing the government and the private sector together to
produce more effective and efficient cleanup plans for a landfill
which, while it was legally accepting a great variety of wastes over
its history, must now be addressed,'' he said.
   Zimmerman said it would be more costly to wage a legal battle
against the government than to settle, and in any event the money
would be better spent on cleaning up Operating Industries. He urged
other companies to join in.

<HEAD>Estonia Spurns Moscow's Request to Back off Sovereignty</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: LEADS thruout with Estonians voting to keep sovereignty
declaration, asking Moscow to go further in condemning Stalinist
repression, NO PICKUP</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Estonian parliament rebuffed Moscow
Wednesday by voting to keep in place the tiny Baltic republic's
declaration of sovereignty.
   The legislature also made Estonian the official language and
asked the central government to consider calling repressions under
the late dicator Josef Stalin ``crimes against humanity.''
   The body refused to rescind its declaration of limited
sovereignty by a 152-91 vote.
   Moscow had branded the move illegal and told the republic to
rescind it.
   Instead, the body agreed merely to be ``guided'' by the national
parliament, known as the Supreme Soviet.
   The vote on the constitutional amendment to make Estonian the
official language was 204-49 with four abstentions, 14 more votes
than the two-thirds required. It was the widest margin of
disagreement yet in the legislature, a former rubber-stamp body in
which debate is a recent phenomenon.
   But the legislature delayed action until January on a proposed
law to force non-native residents to learn Estonian.
   Under the proposed law, residents from other parts of the Soviet
Union would have to learn Estonian. Many of them _ including police,
doctors and shop clerks _ have lived in Estonia for years without
doing so.
   About 40 percent of Estonia's 1.6 million residents are
non-native, and the number is increasing. Estonians fear they will
outnumbered in their own homeland and their language and culture
will die.
   The non-natives speak Russian, which everybody in the Soviet
Union learns. Estonia has both Russian-language and
Estonian-language newspapers, and business can be conducted in
either language.
   A Russian organization called Intermovement denounced the
language proposal as divisive. At a rally last week, some members
even called it an incitement to ``ethnic hatred.''
   Martin Kuusk, an Estonian engineer, said hundreds of thousands of
people have come to Estonia for well-paid factory jobs and ``if they
want to stay, they must absorb our culture. If they do not want to
learn, their country is in the neighborhood.''
   Estonia joins four other republics in declaring their own
official languages. Lithuania, a nearby Baltic republic, passed its
law in recent weeks, but Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, three
Caucasus republics in the south, have had theirs since 1978.
   Estonia approved its declaration of sovereignty in all but
defense and foreign affairs on Nov. 16.
   It also amended the constitution to give itself the right to
reject Soviet laws. But that new power has been used cautiously.
   The Estonian parliament said Wednesday that crimes which it laid
to Stalin should be prosecuted and suggested paying damages to the
surviving victims from the national budget.
   Tens of thousands of Estonians were deported to Siberia and the
Arctic in the 1940s and 1950s, and many died there from the harsh
conditions.
   Stalin ruled from 1924-1953. According to Western historians, he
ordered the murder or imprisonment of millions of Soviets. Many died
in prison.
   The Soviet Union, however, has only begun to admit the horrors of
Stalin's crimes in the past two years. Until now, there has been no
official call to identify and prosecute the thousands of Soviet
citizens who carried out Stalin's orders and are still alive.
   One Estonian activist said republican leaders did not go far
enough in simply asking Moscow to consider the matter.
   ``The Soviet Union is still hunting Nazi war criminals all over
the world,'' said Tonis Avikson, a spokesman for the Estonian
People's Front, an independent political group. ``If we declare the
Stalinist repressions to be crimes against humanity, why shouldn't
we raise our hands against these people?'' he said.

<HEAD>ICAO Council Reserves Judgment On U.S. Downing Of Iranian Airliner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing council of the International Civil
Aviation Organization decided Wednesday to send a report on the
downing of a Iranian airliner by a U.S. warship to an internal panel
for review.
   Assad Kotaite, president of the 33-country governing council,
said at the end of two days of closed meetings that some nations
discussed generally condemning the act of shooting down a civilian
aircraft.
   But Kotaite said the council reserved judgment on the incident
until it hears back from the organization's Air Navigation
Commission at its next meeting, in February.
   He denied there was any discussion of condemning the United
States for the downing of the Iran Air A-300 Airbus on July 3 in the
Persian Gulf. All 290 people aboard the plane were killed.
   Edmund Stohr, U.S. representative to the United Nations agency,
earlier told reporters: ``There were a number of council members
that felt that there should have been a condemnation.''
   Kotaite said: ``The condemnation of the use of force against
civil aircraft was stated by a number of representatives. Now we
postpone our action on the report until spring.''
   The Iranian delegation has urged the council to censure the
United States since a special meeting last July considered the
downing of Iran Air Flight 655 by the USS Vincennes.
   Mahmood Hajighasemali, spokesman for the delegation, told
reporters that Iran will wait for the commission's report. But he
said, ``Our people will not tolerate a further delay in the
finalizing of the issue.''
   President Reagan has promised compensation to families of the
victims, but the U.S. has accepted no blame in the incident.
   Both the ICAO report, which was officially released Wednesday
after being leaked last week, and an earlier U.S. Defense Department
investigation found a series of events aboard the Vincennes led the
ship's crew to erroneously believe the passenger plane was an
attacking Iranian F-14 fighter.
   The report said American warships in the Persian Gulf had no
equipment that allowed them to monitor air traffic control
frequencies. They therefore had no way to hear radio transmissions
between the Iran Air Airbus and air traffic controllers, it said.
   The report said 11 warnings were issued to the jet before it was
downed by two missiles from the Vincennes, but only one warning,
from another U.S. ship in the area, was coded specifically for the
Iran Air flight. That message came only about 40 seconds before the
jet was destroyed.
   The report says military units in hazardous situations should be
provided with the means to monitor air traffic control frequencies
and to communicate directly with civilian controllers. It also
recommends that military warnings be improved.
   Sending the report to the Air Navigation Commission, a 15-person
technical body, follows an example set in 1983 when ICAO
investigated the downing of a Korean Air Lines Boeing 747 by the
Soviet Union. All 269 people aboard were killed.
   After that investigation, the report was sent to the commission.
The ICAO council eventually refused to condemn the Soviet Union,
adopting instead a motion deploring the use of military force
against civilian aircraft.
   ICAO, with 159 member countries, sets standards for civil
aviation and airline safety from its headquarters in Montreal. It
can make recommendations that are not binding on its members.

   A bomb shattered windows and damaged the
facade of the congressional building while Congress was in session
Wednesday evening. No injuries were reported.
   The legislative session was suspended after the bomb was thrown.
Congressional leaders condemmed the bombing and the violence that
has shaken this city of 1 million over the last two days.
   Peru's naval attache to Bolivia, Captain Juan Vega Llona, was
gunned down on Tuesday in the city center by a man and a woman who
described themselves as members of the Revolutionary Workers
Movement.
   The bomb explosion was heard throughout downtown La Paz and
damaged the front of the congressional building, which is across the
street from the presidential palace.
   ``The government commits all its efforts to investigate and
punish those responsible for this attempt against democracy,'' said
Interior Minister Juan Carlos Duran.
   Congressman Mario Rueda Pena said that if the violence continues,
``there exists the danger of a coup.'' He said that if necessary,
the government should declare a state of siege to ``control the
terrorism coming from the cocaine trade.''
   Shortly after the explosion, police received several telephone
calls indicating other bombs would go off in the congressional
building. No other bombs were found.

   Prosecutors said Wednesday they have
dropped their investigation of Mathias Rust for his daredevil,
unauthorized flight into Moscow that embarrassed the Soviet military
last year.
   Rust was freed from a Soviet prison on Aug. 3 after 14 months. He
was sentenced to four years for buzzing the Kremlin and landing in
Red Square, but officials released him early.
   West German prosecutors in the northern city of Itzehoe were
conducting their own probe into whether Rust endangered air traffic
and committed other violations.
   But in their statement Wednesday, they said the investigation was
being dropped because of the time Rust spent in the Soviet prison.
   Rust flew a small Cessna aircraft from northern Germany to the
Soviet Union, landing on Moscow's Red Square on May 28, 1987. He was
19 at the time.
   His unhindered penetration of Soviet air space resulted in a
shake-up of the Soviet military.
   Rust, 20, now lives with his family in Wedel, near the northern
port of Hamburg.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four moderate unions accepted a compromise Wednesday
to end a transit strike that has snarled area traffic, but the
leading union rejected the proposal and called for the walkout to
expand.
   Gerard Becker, speaking for the four moderate unions, read a
statement saying they accepted the offer and ``rejected the policy
of all or nothing.''
   The complex compromise proposal of the Paris Transit Authority
would raise base pay for transit workers by $50 a month by Jan. 1,
1990. It would also grant raises of 2.2 percent that were already
planned for 1989.
   The communist-led General Confederation of Labor, which rejected
the offer, is demanding an immediate monthly increase of $170 for
all employees. The group has asked workers on the national railroad
to walk off the job next week to back its demands.
   Three other smaller unions, who did not participate in the
strike, had accepted the management offer on Tuesday.
   The strike began last month with its strongest support among
maintenance workers. By last week, however, it had halted all trains
on the suburban express network and disrupted subway and bus traffic
throughout the area.
   Premier Michel Rocard's Socialist government called in several
hundred army trucks to help commuters travel to work.
   Transit authorities said service was improving Wednesday as more
strikers returned to work. It was not immediately clear how many
workers would heed the confederation's call to continue the strike.

   Police stopped and searched a
black U.S. judge after mistaking her for someone they believed was
taking photos of an anti-crime operation in a black township, police
and the judge said Wednesday.
   ``Now at least I have a taste of what life is like for blacks who
live in the (black) townships of South Africa 24 hours a day, 365
days a year, knowing the fear, the complete lack of control one has
over one's person when police are doing whatever they want to do,''
said Ladoris Cordell, a judge of the Santa Clara County Superior
Court in San Jose, Calif.
   Ms. Cordell, 39, said it was ``a frightening experience'' when
police seached her on Monday, told her falsely it was illegal to
take photographs, and ordered her to follow them in a car to
headquarters.
   A police spokesman, Col. Saui Sauerman, acknowledged it was not
illegal to take pictures, but he said police can demand that someone
identify himself anytime.
   He said police were conducting a crime-prevention operation
Monday in Soweto-by-the-Sea, a black shantytown outside Port
Elizabeth. During this time, he said, one of the police reported
that another black woman was taking photographs of the operation.
   ``They confronted this lady without the knowledge that she was a
judge from the United States,'' he said.
   Sauerman said Ms. Cordell was released without being detained as
soon as police were satisfied of her identity.
   However, Ms. Cordell, who was visiting South Africa to
participate in a conference for U.N. Human Rights Week, said: ``I
was not free to go. At one point, I was so terrified I actually
wondered if I would be seeing anybody I knew again.''
   By law and custom, South Africa lives under a system called
apartheid that establishes a racially segregated society in which
the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5
million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts,
schools and health services.
   The U.S. judge said police searched her bag without asking
permission, searched the car without giving a reason, and told her
it was illegal to take photographs anywhere in South Africa without
a police permit.
   She was told an officer had seen her photographing police but
denied having done so.
   ``While they were searching, one of the policemen said to me,
`It's not as bad here as they say it is in the U.S., is it?''' she
said.
   Ms. Cordell said police ordered her and a handful of people she
was traveling with back into their car to follow them back to
headquarters for a complete search. However, she said police
confirmed her identity over the radio during the drive and simply
told the group to leave the township.

<HEAD>Mexico Frees Argentine Linked To Iran-Contra Figure</HEAD>

   An Argentine citizen who was arrested by
Mexican authorities after he identified the body of Israeli
counterterrorism expert Amiram Nir has been released, Argentine
Embassy sources said Wednesday.
   The sources said on condition of anonymity that immigration
authorities released Pedro Curchet this week after he proved his
identity and showed he was in the country legally.
   Nir, 38, died Nov. 30 when a small private plane he chartered in
the western Mexican town of Uruapan crashed on a flight to Mexico
City.
   Nir, an adviser on counterterrorism to two Israeli prime
ministers until 1987, was linked to the Iran-Contra affair and
former National Security staffer Col. Oliver North.
   Associates in Uruapan said Nir was negotiating to buy avocados
for export to Europe and Israel and that Curchet was an official of
an avocado exporting company called Eupasa.
   Curchet was one of the people who identified Nir's body on Dec.
1, and he was detained on suspicion that he was engaged in business
activities in Mexico without a work permit.
   ``We were informed Tuesday that he had been freed. Apparently, he
could not produce personal documents at the time he was detained. He
said he had given them to a lawyer who was getting him working
papers,'' one source said.
   ``And, apparently, the lawyer came forth and produced his
passport and he was freed,'' the source said.
   The sources said Curchet was not in contact with the Argentine
Embassy before his arrest, although Argentine nationals in Mexico
are required to register at the embassy.
   The sources said the embassy also did not know Curchet's age,
hometown, or other personal details. Curchet could not be located
Wednesday, although his luggage was still being held by a hotel in
Uruapan, about 200 miles west of Mexico City.
   A secretary for the Mexican Interior Ministry's press office said
nobody was available for comment.
   Nir made several trips to Europe and Iran in arranging for the
secret sale of weapons to Iran in exchange for the release of U.S.
hostages in Lebanon, and U.S. officials had been seeking him for
testimony in the Iran-Contra case.
   Nir used his own name in business dealings in Uruapan but gave
the assumed name of Pat Weber when he rented the plane.
   Mexican authorities said a preliminary investigation blamed the
crash on mechanical failure.
   An airline employee who had hitched a ride on the flight also
died.
   The pilot and Adriana Stanton, 25, a Canadian citizen who worked
for Eupasa, were seriously injured but were reported in good
condition after undergoing operations Wednesday. Stanton apparently
also used an assumed name for the charter flight.
   Nir, son of Holocaust survivors, was buried Tuesday at a suburban
Tel Aviv cemetery in Israel. Hundreds of people, including Cabinet
ministers and former colleagues, attended the funeral.
   Also on Tuesday, the Long Island newspaper Newsday quoted
intelligence sources as saying Nir kept in contact with U.S.
intelligence officials until his death.
   The Newsday report said Nir may have been involved in a large
shipment of Israeli weapons that arrived in the Gulf of Mexico port
of Veracruz last week to bolster Mexico's drug fighting forces.
   On Monday, an informed Israeli source told The Associated Press
that Nir was a licensed Israeli arms dealer, but former colleagues
and friends said there was no evidence Nir ever used the license.
   One friend said Nir was tired of arms dealing after the
Iran-Contra affair and went into the fruit and vegetable importing
business with a base in London.

   The Coast Guard recovered the body of one boater and
called off its search for another man missing after a phantom vessel
demolished their 37-foot catamaran off Key Largo, authorities said
Wednesday.
   The body of John Zeigler of Fort Myers was spotted by an Air
Force helicopter at 5:30 p.m., but Ronald Brennan of Sarasota was
still missing Wednesday night, said Coast Guard spokesman Dan
Vogeley.
   ``Since we've found Zeigler's body, we'll probably not continue
the search in the morning,'' Vogeley said. ``The Coast Guard
searches whenever there's a hope of finding survivors. Since we
found one body and the debris we found was very splintered up, we
don't think the odds are too good that we'll find Brennan alive.''
   The Coast Guard received a cryptic notification from an
unidentified vessel around midnight saying it might have hit
something about six miles southeast of Key Largo.
   Soon afterward, the crew of the Sawa Sawa reported that their
sailing companion, the Suli Suli, had disappeared after what looked
like a pleasurecraft, shining a spotlight, passed by in the opposite
direction, Vogeley said.
   The first debris was found by the Coast Guard at 9:30 a.m. about
six miles east of Key Largo, carried there by Gulf Stream currents,
and the crew of the Sawa Sawa confirmed the wreckage was from its
companion boat. The two boats had left Marathon sailing for Gun Cay
in the Bahamas.
   ``Normally if something is hit, you'll find large pieces of the
boat, but what we're finding in this case suggests the boat that hit
them was very large because we're finding very small pieces of
debris,'' said Coast Guard Petty Officer Joe Dye.
   The Coast Guard dispatched a Falcon jet, a helicopter and two
boats to search for the missing men.
   ``The vessel that originally reported that they hit something did
not give their name, and we're attempting to locate them also,'' Dye
said.
   ``The rules of the road state that a mariner is required to stop
and render assistance to somebody in need. Regardless of whether
they hit them or not, they are required to stop and assist them,''
he said. ``He obviously knew he hit something, so he should have
stopped and checked it out. He might have been able to help them.''
   Asked about the likelihood of finding the other vessel involved
in the collision, Dye conceded, ``It's going to be difficult unless
the guy wants to come forward. Right now we don't have any specific
information on the type of boat it was or where it was going.''

   The leader of Mexico's leftist opposition said
Wednesday that he would work with newly inaugurated Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to cut Mexico's huge burden of
foreign debt, but not on anything else.
   ``We consider Salinas and his government are illegitimate and
this makes for difficult relations,'' Cuauhtemoc Cardenas said in
his first appearance in the United States since Salinas was
inaugurated Dec. 1.
   Cardenas, who was defeated by Salinas in the recent elections,
added that he believes economic conditions will bring about Salinas'
resignation and new elections. He contended that Salinas did not win
the majority he claims.
   Cardenas noted Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's suggestion
that payments on some debts ought to be delayed by as much as 100
years, saying, ``We would support any solution that establishes
priority for Mexico's economic growth and improvement of social
conditions.''
   Any new curb on Mexico's worsening living standards would
endanger social peace, he said.
   Cardenas said the heavily indebted country can no longer continue
in present conditions. He said social risks and tensions are
increasing day by day.
   ``It is estimated that salaries have lost at least 50 percent of
their real purchasing power'' over the last five years, he said. He
added that unemployment has reached unprecedented levels, rising
from 1 million in 1982 to 6.5 million today.
   Cardenas, the son of former President Lazaro Cardenas, told the
Overseas Development Council that new terms should be negotiated
with creditor banks to ease Mexico's debt burden. The council is a
private organization dealing with Third World problems.
   ``The main contribution from the world financial community has
been more loans with which to service the debt,'' he said. Debt
service consists largely in payments of interest.
   Mexico, which owes more than $102 billion, is the largest debtor
in the Third World after Brazil. Much of its debt is owed to U.S.
banks. The country has recently had a $3.5 billion loan from the
U.S. Treasury.
   ``Mexico needs to grow economically _ and, in the short term, the
only resources available to do so are being used to service the
debt,'' Cardenas went on.
   He estimated that since 1983 Mexico had transferred $66 billion
abroad without obtaining any real goods or services in exchange.
   The speech was written before Gorbachev earlier on Wednesday
proposed to the United Nations a delay in the poorest countries'
debt repayments for as long as 100 years. Mexico, where incomes
averaged $1,820 last year, is not usually classed among the poorest
countries.
   For the somewhat better-off debtors, Gorbachev proposed a new
international organization to buy up debt at a discount _ a proposal
similar to one in the trade law President Ronald Reagan signed last
August.

   The mayor of this town of 1,600 people
narrowly defeated his brother Wednesday to win re-election after a
sibling campaign rivalry.
   Only about half the expected 600 voters turned out to decide the
race between Mayor Ben Stewart, 39, and his brother, Bob Stewart,
33. The vote was 168 for the mayor, 154 for his brother in the
non-partisan race.
   Ben Stewart, who has been mayor for eight years, called the
contest ``a very sad, regrettable, unfortunate situation.''
   Bob Stewart, who has been on the town council for eight years,
said his brother had told him he did not intend to seek re-election.
Both were surprised to see each other show up on the first day of
qualifying for the $100-a-month job.
   ``A lot of people are friends of both of us, and this has made it
hard,'' Bob Stewart said.
   Residents of the town, located between Atlanta and Augusta, said
the brothers' disagreement went beyond politics. Bob Stewart, who
runs an insurance company, had filed a complaint in Superior Court
over the distribution of part of their late father's assets.

<HEAD>North Drops Request For To Use Some Documents</HEAD>

   Former White House aide Oliver L. North on
Wednesday dropped efforts to disclose a quarter of the 40,000 pages
of classified documents he wants to use to defend criminal charges
arising from the Iran-Contra affair.
   Defense lawyers filed a brief statement that they were
withdrawing 10,000 pages of CIA intelligence cables on Nicaragua
that were listed in North's Nov. 14 notice of government secrets he
wants to reveal in a public trial.
   The monthly intelligence cables covered a three-year period from
January 1984 through December 1986, a month after the Iran-Contra
affair became known and North was dismissed from his job at the
National Security Council.
   In a motion last month, Iran-Contra special prosecutor Lawrence
E. Walsh sought to bar the defense from using any secret documents
as evidence. Walsh accused the defense of listing a large number of
irrelevant documents ``to overwhelm the court's and the government's
abilities to conduct proceedings'' under the Classified Information
Procedures Act.
   He specifically criticized North's listing of ``large swatches of
CIA cables concerning Nicaragua that bear only the most tangential
relation to the subject matter of the case.''
   North's statement was filed as U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell continued closed hearings into the use of secret documents at
trial. The hearings began last week.
   Gesell has not ruled on secrecy issues and must decide if
classified material North wants to disclose is needed for his
defense. President Reagan said last week he would allow virtually
none of the documents to be disclosed in open court.
   If Gesell decides North cannot get a fair trial wthout disclosing
some documents, he could dismiss the central charge that the former
presidential aide conspired to illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale
proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   To foreclose North's need to disclose government secrets, Walsh
has narrowed the focus of allegations against the former
presidential aide.
   On Tuesday, he filed a detailed statement of North's ``wholly
legitimate'' efforts to try to release American hostages in the
Middle East.
   The summary of North's activities was offered as an unclassified
statement that could be introduced as evidence at trial.
   The Reagan administration, seeking to protect well-guarded
secrets about intelligence operations, is particularly sensitive
about revealing any details about efforts to free the hostages.
   Walsh argues that North and his co-defendants corrupted President
Reagan's arms-for-hostage initiatives by diverting proceeds to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   No date has been set for North's trial. Separate trials have been
ordered for former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and
arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord.

   Hundreds of police who sealed off the Soviet
Mission for Mikhail Gorbachev's visit didn't deter protesters or
other bystanders, including a ``Gorby'' look-alike who briefly
fooled the media and Donald Trump.
   When the real Soviet leader arrived Tuesday at the mission on
Manhattan's fashionable Upper East Side, he waved from his limousine
at the crowds. The car then disappeared into a ramp to an
underground garage.
   But 30 minutes before Gorbachev's arrival, Ronald V. Knapp caused
a bigger commotion among the hundreds of people milling through
nearby streets.
   Knapp, the spitting image of Gorbachev down to what looked like a
wine-colored birthmark on his head, drove up a block away from the
mission in a silver stretch limousine. As confused media members
scrambled for their cameras and notepads, Knapp stood on the corner
speaking through an interpreter.
   The message from the interpreter was simple: He distributed
business cards informing everyone how they could hire Knapp by
contacting his agent.

   The grandson of Soviet revolutionary leader
Leon Trotsky has been given permission to visit the Soviet Union for
the first time in 57 years because the sister he hasn't seen since

   ``Things are much more open in Russia now. It's all part of

   Volkow said he has already been granted a visa to visit Alexandra
Zakharonavna, his half-sister and Trotsky's granddaughter, in Moscow.
   Volkow was living with Trotsky in Mexico City when the former

Aug. 20, 1940. Volkow was only 14 at the time but still remembers
finding Trotsky on the floor, dying from serious head wounds.

   President-elect George Bush filled his top two
trade jobs with a close friend and a Ford administration veteran,
and tapped longtime officials William Webster and Thomas Pickering
for positions he once held himself _ CIA director and U.N.
ambassador.
   Bush said Tuesday he has chosen Texas oilman Robert Mosbacher, a
longtime friend and Republican fund raiser, as commerce secretary,
and Washington attorney Carla Hills as U.S. trade representative.
The latter move prompted quick Democratic criticism that Bush had
selected someone without extensive experience in trade.
   Rounding out appointments to his economic team, Bush announced
selection of Stanford University economist Michael Boskin to head
the Council of Economic Advisers. Bush called Boskin ``one of this
nation's preeminent economists.''
   Bush said he was seeking continuity at the CIA when he asked
Webster to stay on at the intelligence agency. President Reagan
named Webster, a former FBI director, to the CIA job last year after
the death of William Casey.

   The man chosen by President-elect George Bush
to be his chief economic adviser has advocated major changes in
Social Security and other entitlement programs, calling for a
``major attack'' on benefits to the middle class.
   In a book last year assessing the Reagan administration's
economic track record, Michael Boskin wrote that President Reagan's
successor should make limiting such government benefits a top
priority.
   ``Spending can be controlled only by a major attack on
middle-class entitlements,'' Boskin wrote in ``Reagan and the
Economy: The Successes, Failures and Unfinished Agenda.''
   ``Welfare for the wealthy simply can no longer be afforded,'' he
maintained. ``More cost-conscious ... spending on these programs
will preserve benefits for the needy.''

   A fatal type of skin cancer is affecting more
people at a younger age than ever before, and the trend may get
worse if chemical pollution continues to leach natural ozone from
the atmosphere, an expert says.
   Dr. Darrell S. Rigel, an assistant clinical professor of
dermatology at New York University Medical School, said Tuesday that
melanoma, a type of skin cancer that can be fatal if not treated, is
now diagnosed at the rate of one of 128 Americans, an increase of
about 1,500 percent compared to 1935.
   Even more disturbing, the ages of patients developing melanoma is
dropping dramatically, Rigel told the American Academy of
Dermatology annual meeting.
   ``Five years ago it was unusual to see someone under the age of
40 with skin cancer,'' said Rigel. ``Now we're commonly seeing
people in their 20s with skin cancer.''

   Atlantis' astronauts returned home under a cover
of darkness early today, a fitting finale to their secret space
mission during which they reportedly launched a powerful spy
satellite into orbit over the Soviet Union.
   Atlantis, bruised a lot more than usual, streaked out of orbit
Tuesday, completing a four-day space voyage with an unusual
afternoon landing on a packed clay runway at Edwards Air Force Base
in California's Mojave Desert.
   The military mission, the second shuttle flight since Challenger
exploded 34 months ago, was believed to have included deployment of
a sophisticated satellite that can peer through clouds and darkness
to spy on the Soviets.
   The five astronauts' low-key, middle-of-the-night arrival here
seemed an appropriate ending to the classified flight, which had
been shrouded in secrecy since it launched Friday from Cape

   A 17-month FBI ``sting'' had Colombian drug-cartel
point men using a phony electronics company as a clubhouse, leading
to indictments of 93 people and leaving traffickers wondering, ``who

   About half of the suspects were in custody Tuesday in Boston,
Houston, Los Angeles, Tampa and Miami, and many were expected to
surrender later, the FBI said. Among those arrested were a Latin
recording star and two former Miami police officers.
   The sting, nicknamed ``Cat-Com'' for Catch Communications, also
allowed federal agents to seize about 5 tons of cocaine, 100 tons of
marijuana and some heroin, authorities said.
   R.A. Communications and Computers Inc. ``essentially was used as
a clubhouse or a meeting place for first-line drug traffickers
associated with the Medellin and Cali cartels,'' said William Perry,
South Florida's acting FBI director.

   The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, this country's
first line of defense against a foreign oil embargo, is vulnerable
to a terrorist attack, congressional investigators and Energy
Department officials said Wednesday.
   ``Improvements are needed in the (reserve) security program,''
Keith Fultz of the congressional General Accounting Office told the
House Government Operations subcommittee on environment, energy and
natural resources.
   Fultz said a mock terrorist attack on the 550-million-barrel
reserve in Louisiana and Texas last year symbolically damaged or
destroyed facilities vital to recovering the oil from underground
caverns during an embargo.
   While the 11-member Army Special Forces team did not get into the
storage sites, it ``knocked out'' power substations, motor control
centers, an emergency operations center, pipeline valves and a
bridge during the test.

<HEAD>Those Swelling Lights Of Hanukkah Also Reflected In Christmas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The story is that with only enough oil to last
for one day, the lamps miraculously burned for eight.
   That's one of the wonders of Hanukkah, whose crescendo of lights
reaches its peak Saturday at sunset when Jewish homes and synagogues
glow with the full eight tapers of the menorahs.
   It's the religious calendar's prelude to Christmas, which is
separate, but which indirectly hinges on the ancient event marked by
that effusion of Jewish lights.
   Starting with a customary single candle when the holiday began
last Saturday, an additional one was lit on each successive night
until the full-orbed tier of eight shines this weekend.
   The holiday, a time of games and gift-giving, is sometimes
regarded as a Jewish counterpart of Christmas and both signify a new
start, a fresh element of faith.
   Also, without the precedent of Hanukkah, scholars point out that
there presumably could be no Christmas.
   The Jewish ``festival of lights'' celebrates an ancient turn of
history that prevented destruction of the ``mother faith'' of
Judaism from which the Christian tradition emerged.
   But the specific significance and origins of two holidays differ,
with Christmas marking the birth of Christ and Hanukkah recalling a
much earlier event of great joy _ Judaism's regained right to exist.
   This happened in about 165 B.C. when a small guerrilla army led
by Judas Maccabee, the ``hammerer,'' defeated the world's then
mightiest military force of Syria, which had sought to stamp out
every vestige of Jewish religion.
   The ancient victory was celebrated by cleansing the Temple in
Jerusalem of installed pagan altars and prostitutes and rededicating
it with kindling of its lamps. On a one-day oil supply, legend says,
those lamps inexplicably kept on burning for eight.
   But the phenomenon of the lamps had a surpassing antecedant _ the
amazing victory by a small, motley mountain band of guerrillas over
the foreign conqueror, the ancient Syrian empire.
   It had spread over the entire Middle East and ordered the
extermination of all traces of Judaism so that subjects would be
``one people'' serving the state pantheon of idols.
   ``Whoever refuses should be put to death,'' it was decreed, and
thousands of Jews were slain. Scripture scrolls were ripped apart
and burned. Many Jews submitted and bowed to the state idols.
   All over Israel, pagan altars were erected and patrols circulated
to compel allegiance to the new ``gods.'' Jewish obervance of the
Sabbath was forbidden. In the Temple, turned into a scene of
debaucheries, stood a statue to Jupiter.
   If the suppression had succeeded, it would have crushed Judaism,
which would have eliminated the seedbed of Christianity.
   But revolt flamed against that threat.
   An aging father of five sons, the Maccabees, attacked and killed
a Syrian officer who was forcing Jewish villagers to make offerings
to a pagan altar. The Maccabees fled to the hills.
   Gathering a scanty, ill-equipped crew of resistance fighters, the
eldest Maccabee son, Judas, told them:
   ``Arm yourselves and be brave. It is better for us to die in
battle than to witness the ruin of our nation and our sanctuary.''
   It was a one-sided, three-year war, marking the first successful
use of guerrilla tactics _ lighting strikes and retreats, surprise
attacks, ambushes, night raids, harassments.
   At one point, with a Jewish army of about 3,000 gazing down from
the hills at the assembled Syrian force of 47,000, including
horsemen, foot soliders and spearmen on elephants, Jewish troops
murmured:
   ``How can we, few as we are, fight such a mighty host as this?.''
Judas Maccabee told them:``In the sight of heaven there is no
difference between deliverance by many or few ... so do not be
afraid of them.''
   By various ruses, scattered night attacks, diversions, covert
movements and infiltrating lines to kill off Syrian commanders, the
Maccabees finally beat off the Syrian repression.
   It was a turning point for civilization, preserving the
monotheistic heritage of faith now spread around the world, Islam as
well as Christianity, both descended from Judiasm.
   Without those Hanukkah lights, the Christmas lights might never
have come on.

   The 1988 ``Alternatives'' poster shows a
sleighing Santa and reindeer flying over the Holy Family and Child
in the manger. A caption asks, ``Whose Birthday Is It, Anyway?''
   ``Alternatives,'' a campaign seeking to recover a Christ-centered
Christmas and to protest its commercialization, this year has the
backing of more than 100,000 Protestant and Roman Catholic
congregations across the country.
   Milo Thornberry, director of the campaign founded by various
Christian groups in 1973, says it doesn't want people to reject the
whole notion of gift-giving and celebration nor send them on a
``guilt trip'' about it.
   Rather, it seeks to help them ``restore perspective to a season
that often degenerates into a religion-sanctioned orgy of
self-indulgence.''
   Sponsoring agencies for 1988 are Detroit's Catholic Diocese and
seven major Protestant denominations.
   ``Alternatives,'' which distributes resource material, rituals
and Bible study guides, suggests such alternative activities as:
   _Reducing time spent shopping and watching television and using
it for Bible study and meditation.
   _Replacing the Santa tradition with that of St. Nicholas, patron
saint who loved and cared for children.
   _More personal, thoughtful and values-centered gift-giving
instead of money-spending competitions to give ``the best.''
   _Giving a fourth of holiday spending money to the needy, and
reaching out to people who otherwise would be alone at Christmas.

   The new Miss America, Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson,
says she is ``a very religious person and faith in God is my No. 1
support system.''
   In an interview with The Lutheran, the monthly magazine of the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, she said other media had
peppered her with all kinds of questions except about her favorite
subject _ religion.
   ``No matter where I am and what I hope to accomplish, I know I
have my best friend (God@Jesus) with me,'' she said.
   The blonde Miss Carlson, 22, of Anoka, Minn., a senior at
Stanford University, was crowned Sept. 10 in Atlantic City, N.J.,
after competing as Miss Minnesota.
   She said she regards today's society as ``quite immoral'' and
would like to do her part in improving it. She voiced appreciation
for the moral values received from her family and her church, Zion
Lutheran in Anoka.
   A virtuoso violinist who has often performed at her church and
elsewhere, she said she always said a special prayer before going
out to face an audience.
   ``I always ask God to be with me. I believe my violin playing is
a gift from God.''

   After sticking it to everyone else for the
past 10 years, J.R. Ewing has finally gotten a taste of his own
medicine on CBS' ``Dallas.''
   First, J.R. (Larry Hagman) landed in jail on a rape charge. Then
he was put on a chain gang. Now, he's guest of honor at a shotgun
wedding.
   J.R. gets hitched to ``purty little thing'' Cally Harper, played
by Cathy Podewell. The wedding, catered by Smith & Wesson, takes
place Friday.
   ``I'm a waitress at a hunting lodge in Arkansas where J.R. and
Bobby Ewing take rooms on a hunting trip,'' said Podewell. ``When I
come to their table, J.R. sets his sights on me with a vengeance.
   ``We have a rendezvous, and he says, `She's too beautiful to stay
in a small town.' He sweet talks me into bed. Then my two older
brothers come in and stick a shotgun under his nose.''
   ``Dallas'' has always been outrageous, but this year with Hagman
serving as executive producer, the show is seeking new directions.
For one thing, Hagman is taking the show about an oil family out of
the boardroom. George Kennedy has joined the cast as the foe in an
an old-fashioned range war with the Ewings.
   The show, of course, has never taken itself seriously. That has
enabled it to get away with such stunts as dismissing Bobby's death
_ and an entire season _ as a dream of his wife, Pamela.
   J.R. has been wounded _ by the shot heard 'round the world in
1980, then by wife Sue Ellen at the close of last season _ but he's
never had his comeuppance. In the current sequence, he's on the
receiving end of some rough, rural justice.
   Caught under the covers with Cally, he tries to fend off her
brothers by telling them he's J.R. Ewing. But it doesn't work
because the bucolic brethren have never heard of the famous Texas
oil millionaire. The brothers are played by Cliff Potts and Sherman
Howard.
   ``I don't bat an eyelash when he says who he is,'' said Podewell.
``Yet, I've never encountered anyone like him before. He's so full
of confidence.''
   The sheriff puts J.R. in jail, but Cally agrees to help break him
out after he promises to marry her. The escape attempt goes awry,
and he's caught and sentenced to 10 years on the chain gang.
   ``My brothers break him out of prison so they can kill him,''
said Podewell. ``I tell them I'm pregnant and he has to marry me.''
   Which brings us to Friday's episode and the shotgun wedding. No
help is on the way. Bobby is back in Dallas, unaware of his
brother's plight.
   J.R. does escape after the wedding and returns to Dallas. But
Cally is right behind him, waving the wedding certificate under his
nose.
   ``He doesn't want anything to do with me, but I think I'm here to
stay,'' said Podewell, who has a two-year contract with ``Dallas,''
her first series. ``The closest I've ever come to being a regular
was a two-part role as Kirk Cameron's love interest on `Growing
Pains.' I played that as 17 although I'm 24.''
   She also stars as Martin Sheen's daughter in the upcoming comedy
feature ``Beverly Hills Brats.''
   Podewell was born in Evanston, Ill., but grew up in Walnut Creek
in Northern California. Her father's a teacher and coach at Berkeley
High School and her mother's a real estate agent.
   Her grandparents, however, are actors in Chicago. Lester
Podewell, 81, recently had a part in ``Shoeless Joe,'' starring
Kevin Costner. Her grandmother, Beverly (Younger) Podewell, was a
regular with Studs Turkel on ``Studs' Place'' in 1950.
   Podewell began acting in high school, then studied theater arts
and dancing at the University of California at Santa Barbara.
   ``I moved to Los Angeles and almost immediately got a role on
`Lady Blue,' which got me my Screen Actors Guild card,'' she said.
``I got killed by Johnny Depp, who's now on `21 Jump Street' and
David Oliver, who was on `A Year in the Life.'''

   It is difficult not to view Maria Callas' life as
high melodrama or Greek tragedy, says John Ardoin, executive
producer of ``Maria Callas: an Operatic Biography.''
   The documentary about the great soprano airs tonight on PBS as
part of the ``Great Performances'' series.
   Callas, who died in 1977 at age 53, was famed for her voice and
her acting, for reviving the bel canto repertoire in the 20th
century, for being a superstar before the word was invented, for her
liaison with Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis.
   ``No one ever had so much and wound up with so little,'' said
Ardoin. ``It's hard not to see it as the gods taking away all
they've given.''
   The TV show includes Callas singing and talking and others
talking about her.
   Ardoin says public interest in Callas remains high. ``A lot of
people remember her still. A big number are hooked on her because a
friend played them a record which reached out and grabbed their
attention and won't let them go.''
   Ardoin had been a friend of Callas since 1964. His fourth book
about her, focusing on her master classes at the Juilliard School,
is scheduled to be published this month. He says Maria Callas was
two people, Maria the person and Callas the diva.
   ``It was like two people fighting for some kind of supremacy in
this body, one always trying to dominate the other,'' he said.
   ``It's not typical. Most singers have a pretty good sense of
identity. I've never encountered anyone else who had such a terrible
battle between the person and the persona. Maybe Marilyn Monroe.
   ``Maria spent most of her time away from the stage trying to
understand Callas. She knew she had a tremendous effect on people;
she never really could understand why.
   ``It was just chemistry _ which she had in spades.
   ``On stage, when she did something, it was in such perfect sync
with the music, it knocked the socks off of you. She physically was
the music. Whether you realized what was happening or not, something
told you it was right.''
   Ardoin, music critic for The Dallas Morning News, wrote the
script for a 1978 documentary on PBS, ``Callas,'' which emphasized
her art.
   This new documentary, he says, emphasizes her as a woman.
   ``Director Tony Palmer had an idea which I think was wonderful.
He was more interested in the quality of this life. I helped him
with interviews and background material. A lot of her voice speaking
on the soundtrack came from interviews I had with Maria.''
   Ardoin went through his 40 hours of taped Callas interviews for a
four-hour documentary that will air on National Public Radio in
January.
   Her best recordings, he believes, are ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' in
Berlin, ``Medea'' in Dallas, ``La Sonnambula'' in Cologne and ``La
Traviata'' in London, all live performances. Ardoin says, ``She had
that extra additive of the audience inspiration of the moment.''
   The tour of concerts that Callas undertook in 1973 showed a voice
past its prime. Ardoin says, ``I think part of her reason (for
touring) was to show Onassis she was not beaten. She could survive
without him. She really couldn't. She truly loved him and wanted to
make her life with him.
   ``She had to show she was still beautiful, had a new boyfriend,
had her audience back. When he died (in 1975), there was nobody to
play the game with anymore, and she gave up.''
   At the Carnegie Hall concert, somebody yelled, ``You are music.''
Ardoin says, ``Some of the most absorbing moments in `Maria Callas:
an Operatic Biography' are when you watch her living the music. How
different she looks in the `Don Carlo' and `The Barber of Seville'
arias. It was the music that transformed her.
   ``That solitary voice at Carnegie sums her up best. I can't think
of a better way to say it. The look of her and the sound of her was
music.''

   Thanks to a mixture of holiday-season generosity
and enlightened self-interest, many people give some extra thought
at this time of year to charitable contributions.
   Donations bring the psychic reward of helping out your favorite
social service agency, religious organization or college.
   And they also offer the financial reward of reducing your income
tax bill, since most contributions remain fully deductible under tax
reform.
   If you have any doubt about whether a specific institution or
program entitles you to a deduction, you can check your local
library for Internal Revenue Service Publication 78, ``Cumulative
List of Organizations.''
   Whenever you contemplate charitable giving, experts in personal
finance say, it makes sense to know the tax rules so that both donor
and donee get the greatest possible benefit.
   For one thing, you must itemize your deductions in order to take
advantage of the tax break. A special arrangement that was set up
for non-itemizers a few years ago no longer exists.
   So if you are in a situation where you itemize in some years and
take the standard deduction in others, it makes sense to consider
concentrating your contributions in years when you plan to itemize.
   The simplest form of contribution is cash, which can be
documented either by a receipt or canceled check. But that is by no
means the only way to do it.
   ``If cash is not readily available, it is possible to charge
donations on a credit card and take the deduction in 1988, while
deferring payment until 1989,'' says the Arthur Young accounting
firm.
   Many organizations accept non-cash contributions such as
clothing, books or canned goods, which you can deduct at their fair
market value.
   ``Specific records must be kept to support a deduction for
donated property,'' cautions Deloitte Haskins & Sells, another large
accounting firm.
   If you claim non-cash contributions of more than $500, the rules
require that you file a special form with your tax return to
document it. Above $5,000, you also must provide a formal appraisal,
unless the item involved is a publicly traded stock whose value at
the time of donation is a matter of public record.
   Stocks and other capital investments that have appreciated in
value since the time of their purchase qualify for special treatment
when they are given as charitable gifts.
   Donors of these securities can take a deduction for the full
current market value, and avoid a capital gains tax liability at the
same time. Higher-income people giving substantial amounts of
appreciated property are advised to check beforehand to see whether
this will expose them to the alternative minimum tax.
   There is nothing to prevent you from contributing a security on
which you have a loss. But the experts say it is smarter to sell
such a security and then give the cash proceeds to the charity of
your choice.
   That way, you can write the loss off on your tax return, within
limits set by the tax code, as well as take a deduction for the
security's market value.
   What if you prefer to contribute your time, rather than money,
doing volunteer work? The rules don't permit you to assign a
financial value to your time and deduct it.
   However, say accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, ``you can take a
deduction for your out-of-pocket expenses incurred in donating your
time, and for the charitable use of your automobile.''
   The standard rate for car use is 12 cents a mile, plus any
parking or toll fees you pay. If you are willing to keep good
records of all your auto expenses, you may be able to take a bigger
deduction.

<HEAD>Trouble For Bush?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A large percentage of economic forecasters are
looking for trouble ahead, and they're finding support for their
fears in the past.
   Whether the fears are justified is an entirely different matter.
A vocal minority of forecasters, for instance, say their brethren
are locked into a neurotic view of the economic world as one in need
of punishment.
   Why the punsishment? Good times breed the feeling. And when those
good times persist despite budget and trade deficits and myriad
other unresolved problems, a sense of guilt develops. Good times, it
is felt, are undeserved.
   In the political realm, therefore, a good many economists say
that even if George Bush enjoys an extended honeymoon he eventually
will be confronted by the problems. It is his fate, they say, to
face the deficit and tax monsters.
   This is how they set the stage:
   For the eight years of the Reagan administration the economy
enjoyed great prosperity. Interest rates fell. Inflation declined
sharply and remained fairly low. Both stocks and bonds rose by
roughly 11 percent a year in real terms.
   Business strengthened itself during this time. Small companies
prospered. Employment grew. Large companies became much more
competitive. Corporate profits rose. By most measures, real income
also rose.
   All this came about while some economists worried themselves
silly. It couldn't be happening they said, pointing to the
mountainous budget deficit, spectacular trade deficit, low savings
rate, and shaky financial institutions.
   They insist we have run up debts that must be repaid.
   The comparison of Ronald Reagan and Calvin Coolidge is convenient
for such thinkers. The ``Roaring 20s'' of Calvin Coolidge's
administration were among the best years of the century for stocks.
Then the economy collapsed.
   In the ``bad things to come'' scenario, President-elect George
Bush plays the role of Herbert Hoover. Coolidge's era buried Hoover.
Ronald Reagan's era could disintegrate and smother Bush and his
plans.
   The scenario appeals to those who like their rationales well
packaged, but such packaging is accomplished only by eliminating
some factors.
   Securities markets, for example, might be overpriced but not to
the same extent as in 1929. The Federal Reserve Board has a better
handle on the economy. Industry today is stronger than it was two
decades ago or in 1929.
   Such factors don't fit into the package. It doesn't stop the
thinking, however. Those who see trouble ahead then point to an
expansion that already is six years old, which they view as old age.
It cannot last, they say.
   Perhaps not, but recessions have always been a threat, and an
actuality too. President Eisenhower had three of them, and his terms
generally are viewed as having been economically stable and
successful.
   There is no question that Bush's administration will be forced to
deal with tough matters, including the twin deficits of budget and
trade, tax questions, bad debts everywhere, structural problems in
banking, poverty, uncertainty.
   In the years since World War II the stock market has declined
five of six times during the first year after a Republican election
victory. It could do so again, adding to the existing pressures. But
it will come back.
   As important as the potential downside to the problems is how
effective the new president's policies are. There are always
problems to deal with, which is why presidents are elected. Bush
isn't without weapons to use.
   Some of those weapons might have to be used to infiltrate the
minds of those who spread the philosophy of inevitable failure.

   Just a bass and a voice. Simple, right? Well, not
really for Rob Wasserman, who traveled all over the world to record
``Duets,'' his new album of twosomes with such artists as Aaron
Neville, Rickie Lee Jones, Lou Reed and Stephane Grappelli.
   He used a basic formula for the 12 songs on ``Duets'': The artist
selected the tune, the location and an instrument of his or her own
preference. But only Wasserman and the singer could appear on the
finished recording.
   ``There was no official producer on most of the tunes,'' he said,
``just me one-on-one with the artists. It's a real intimate album;
it sounds like that. It's got its own uniqueness.''
   Wasserman sought a range of styles for ``Duets,'' from Neville's
soul to the pop vocals of Jones, Reed's heady rock and the jazz
interpretations of Grappelli. The songs range from the Hoagy
Carmichael standard, ``Stardust,'' sung by Neville, to Jennifer
Warnes' version of the Leonard Cohen composition, ``Ballad of the
Runaway Horse.''
   ``It was challenging because I didn't just want to become an
accompaniest,'' said the 35-year-old bassist in a recent interview
at the SIR studio.
   ``I really focused on every song being different. Some tunes it
was more appropriate to play the simplest possible bass lines. On
other songs, I was all kind of roles.''
   He also was in all kinds of places. ``Duets'' was recorded in Los
Angeles, London, San Francisco and Texas. ``This has been more than
an album, it's been a journey, an adventure.''
   The record is a progression, numerically, for Wasserman. In 1983,
he recorded ``Solo,'' an album featuring only his bass playing. The
enthusiastic response for that work encouraged Wasserman to add
vocals on his next LP.
   ``I didn't really want to jump from the solo record to a band,''
said Wasserman, a native of California who lives in Marin County.
``I'd worked with a lot of singers on and off for a lot of years and
I realized that that was a great combination. For me that's always
blended really well if you find the right voices.
   ``I didn't know a lot of people on the album before I did it,''
he admitted. ``Sometimes I didn't get to play musically with them
until the session. There was that risk of walking into the studio
and not knowing whether you're ever going to hit it off.''
   Also performing on ``Duets'' is Dan Hicks, former leader of ``Dan
Hicks and His Hot Licks,'' who covers ``Gone With the Wind.''
   ``He was one of the first working jobs I had after I got out of
music school,'' Wasserman recalled.
   ``When I joined the band, most of the time it was just me and
him. He ended up being the first duet I ever played in. I asked him
to be on this record because I felt he was one of those unique
artists who hasn't had a recording out in quite a while.''
   Reed's appearance on the album came about in true storybook
fashion. Wasserman, who needed to record a few additional songs to
fill the album, was in a bar in Copenhagen when Reed walked in.
   ``The guitar player I was with said, `That's Lou Reed.' I had a
demo of the album with me. I went to him and gave him the tape and
figured that's the last I'll ever see of him.''
   Not exactly. He called Wasserman less than 15 minutes later. ``He
had heard the Aaron Neville piece and was flipped out.''
   And Reed, whose songs include ``Heroin'' and ``Walk on the Wold
Side,'' decided to record the standard, ``One for the Road.''
   ``I thought it was a great selection. He was also considering
`These Foolish Things,''' said Wasserman. He and Reed gave the song
a rock treatment.
   ``We didn't want to really do it in a jazz mode. I said, `I'll
play the chords on the bass.' We made up this primal, stripped down
kind of groove. It's still just two people.''
   They did it in one take.
   However, he spent the longest time working on the Warnes track.
   ``She's a very hardworking and intense character,'' Wasserman
said. ``She wanted every word to be perfect. With Jennifer, every
word had to be sung correctly. It had a lot of sculpturing to it.
She did a lot of incredibly subtle background singing.''
   An hourlong video of ``Duets'' is being filmed. The Neville
segment and the Reed segment _ with singer-songwriter-actor Tom
Waits as a bartender _ have already been shot.
   Next, he'd like to do a ``Trios'' LP, recording a piece with soul
queen Aretha Franklin and classical cellist Yo Yo Ma, He also
envisions a combination of himself with rocker Van Morrison and
Rickie Lee Jones.
   Of course, Wasserman would still like to do a solo LP.
   ``It would probably be a live concert solo album,'' he said. ``I
would like to do it when I have a new set of solo, bass songs.
   ``To me, all this is exciting.''

   Gaming whiz Steve Wynn stood in the
sun-baked parking lot of his latest casino acquisition recently and
enthused: ``Laughlin reminds me of what Las Vegas was 40 years ago.''
   Wynn isn't alone in the attachment America's gaming giants have
developed for this fast-growing gambling community, nestled along
the scenic Colorado River near the southern tip of Nevada.
   What once was a tiny bar and a handful of slot machines hidden at
the end of an isolated road has been transformed into one of the
premier growth areas in this booming gambling state.
   Giants of the hotel-casino industry such as Holiday Inn, Ramada,
Hilton, Circus Circus and Golden Nugget are clamoring to get a piece
of the Laughlin action.
   The 1988 visitor count is expected to be up by one-third from the
estimated 1.5 million a year ago. Casino revenues are forecast to
surpass those of Lake Tahoe, the No. 3 market in the state after Las
Vegas and Reno, in a year or two.
   Bolstered by balmy temperatures, ``No Vacancy'' signs abound
throughout the winter months.
   ``Welcome Snowbirds'' flashes a 20-foot-high neon sign atop Don
Laughlin's Riverside Resort and Casino, the flagship of the
ever-growing list of casino resorts here.
   It was Laughlin, 57, who happened across this remote area while
flying along the Colorado River in a private plane in 1966. He
spotted an out-of-the-way, rundown bar and paid $225,000 for the
saloon, a blackjack table, a dozen slot machines and eight
boarded-up motel rooms _ four of which became the temporary home for
the Laughlin family.
   Giving the town his name wasn't Laughlin's idea. When postal
officials asked for a name for the patch of real estate 20 years
ago, Laughlin suggested Casino, noting a town on Nevada's northern
border was named Jackpot.
   The inspector, of Irish descent, balked at the idea and opted for
Laughlin, calling it ``a good Irish name.''
   For many years, Don Laughlin's motel-casino was the only game in
town because of the remote location and competition from Las Vegas,
95 miles to the northwest.
   The town came alive in the early 1980s, with gaming revenues
climbing to $41 million by 1981, doubling to $80 million by 1983 and
hitting $242.4 million in 1987.
   Lake Tahoe recorded $309.5 million in gaming revenues in 1987,
while Reno had $552.5 million and Las Vegas hit $2.237 billion.
   Location plays a major role in Laughlin's stunning growth.
   The town is about 280 miles _ the same distance as Las Vegas _
from most Southern California cities, the markets that feed Southern
Nevada's voracious appetite for gamblers.
   Gaming giants sat on the sidelines for years while land
speculators touted the area as ``the next Las Vegas.''
   Suddenly, the major players began to make their move two years
ago, when the town had 1,600 hotel rooms. Today Laughlin has 4,118
rooms at nine resorts, with 3,000 new rooms to be completed in the
next 12 to 18 months.
   The first major player to move here was Circus Circus, the
family-themed gaming empire with operations in Las Vegas and Reno.
The company built an $80 million 1,238-room hotel and casino in the
shape of a Mississippi riverboat. The facility, with smokestacks
soaring 21 stories high and paddlewheels 90 feet in diameter,
dominates the waterfront.
   ``Not since Noah has anyone built such a big boat in the middle
of the desert,'' quipped Bill Paulos, the hotel's general manager,
when the company opened the facility on a blistering July 1, 1987.
   Last June, Ramada set up shop across busy Casino Center Drive,
the main drag that was a sleepy two-lane street six years ago and
now carries four lanes of cars and campers, bumper-to-bumper, around
the clock.
   The $60 million Ramada Express features an early Americana
railroad theme, with a steam engine train toting passengers around
the 406-room hotel and casino.
   Harrah's, the gaming arm of Holiday Inn, opened the Mexican-style
Del Rio in July. The $65 million, 446-room resort became the ninth
hotel-casino in Laughlin.
   Wynn, who owns the Golden Nugget in downtown Las Vegas and is
building a $550 million resort on the Las Vegas Strip, said Laughlin
couldn't be ignored any longer.
   He bought the Nevada Club casino from Del Webb Corp. for $40
million in May, taking over Oct. 1 and announcing plans to build a
$70 million, 1,100-room, 20-story hotel on the site.
   Add to the list of high rollers the Hilton Corp., which announced
in September it would build a $127 million, 1,200 room hotel and
casino in Laughlin, with construction set to begin next year.
   Most workers in Laughlin still commute from Bullhead City, Ariz.,
across the Colorado, a town built to house workers building the
Davis Dam, which was completed in 1953.
   As for Laughlin itself, its population is now 3,400, up from just
94 four years ago.
   The visitor count is expected to top 2 million this year,
compared with 17 million in Las Vegas, 6.8 million in Reno-Sparks
and 5 million in the Lake Tahoe basin.
   ``We average 20,000 visitors a day in the winter months,'' said
Dan Tucksen, executive director of the Laughlin Chamber of Commerce.
The figure jumps to 50,000 on weekends.

<HEAD>Music Makers: New Alter Ego for Harrison, Dylan, et al.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The true legend of the Traveling Wilburys
began when George Har..., er, Nelson Wilbury needed to record an
extra song at short notice and invited two of his dinner companions
to lend their voices.
   Nine days and 10 songs later, the result was one of those happy
accidents that proves there's more to the music business than
accountants and estates.
   You won't find the names George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison,
Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne on ``Volume One,'' the debut album by the
oddly-named Traveling Wilburys. But the dark glasses and pseudonyms
can't hide those familiar talents. Orbison died at the age of 52 on
Dec. 6 of a heart attack.
   ``We definitely didn't want to treat this like a supergroup,''
said Petty, or Charles T. Wilbury Jr. ``I don't even like the term
all that much. But we were aware that it would be viewed as such. We
look at the Wilburys as a completely other persona as ourselves.''
   Harrison mentioned to Lynne and Orbison over dinner last spring
that he needed a new B-side for a 12-inch single release. The other
two said they'd help him put together a song.
   The former Beatle had to retrieve his guitar, which he'd left at
Petty's California house during a visit a few days earlier, Petty
said. The lead Heartbreaker was also asked to join in on the record.
   Since all the nearby studios were booked, the three amigos had to
impose on another friend who had recording facilities in his house.
Dylan said he'd be glad to offer his assistance.
   ``We all sat around the grass at Bob's house and wrote this song
called `Handle With Care' and recorded it that night,'' Petty
recalled. ``When it was all done it sounded really good.''
   Much too good, they thought, for a B-side. So they kept on
writing and recording.
   ``It was a very innocent thing, really,'' Petty said. ``We were
just kind of enjoying it and we were deep into it before we realized
almost what we were doing.''
   That spontaneity, and a lot of humor, comes through on the
record. ``Volume One'' sounds like a group of friends, albeit
extremely talented friends, enjoying themselves together. All five
trade lead and backing vocals and strum guitars.
   The results are a cross between Harrison's early '70s solo work
and the electronic flourishes Lynne brought to the Electric Light
Orchestra. Orbison's ``Not Alone Any More'' is in the vein he's
mined for a quarter-century and the three songs Dylan dominates are
some of his best work in years.
   The song ``Dirty World'' pokes fun at Prince with a series of
sexual double-entendres and the wickedly funny ``Tweeter and the
Monkey Man'' is littered with Bruce Springsteen references.
   The record was a true collaboration, Petty said. On ``Tweeter,''
for instance, he and Dylan spoke lyrics into a tape recorder then
edited them into a story. Other Wilburys added the chorus, he said.
   Credit a non-rocker, Prince Charles of Great Britain, with the
name Traveling Wilburys, Petty said.
   Harrison and Lynne performed at the Prince's Trust concert last
year and were complimented by the host following the show, he said.
The prince said the two should form a band, and when they asked for
a name, he suggested the Traveling Wilburys, Petty said.
   The quintet quickly adopted the persona. Harrison is identified
throughout as Nelson Wilbury, Lynne is Otis Wilbury, Orbison is
Lefty Wilbury and Dylan's called Lucky.
   The whimsical liner notes explain that ``the original Wilburys
were a stationary people who, realizing that their civilization
could not stand still forever, began to go for short walks.''
   The offbeat sense of humor seemed to take the pressure off the
participants and lent the album a certain mystique, said Paul Grein,
author of the Chartbeat column in Billboard magazine. It's working _
the album debuted on the charts at No. 57 and shot to No. 23 in its
second week, he said.
   ``It's destined to be a very big hit,'' Grein said.
   The Wilbury monikers also took some pressure off the businessmen,
since Harrison, Dylan, Petty and Orbison are all contracted to
different record companies. There are more than just joking reasons
why all the names were left off the album jacket.
   Petty said the Wilburys have been approached to do a tour, and
though no one's said no, they haven't all said yes, either.
   He hinted that the Wilbury family tree might be larger, but
wouldn't say if a ``Volume Two'' is planned. There's the obvious
risk of losing the spark that made this record special.
   ``I don't think anybody wants the Wilburys to be work,'' he said.
``I would leave the door open to that. We wouldn't rule it out
because we had so much fun. I think it could be done again, but not
right away.
   ``We were all very pleased with the way it came out,'' Petty
continued. ``It's so nice when you get the spirit into the vinyl.
That's what you strive for. I hope everybody smiles when they hear
it.''

<HEAD>Fujitsu To Market World's Fastest Supercomputer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's largest computer maker, has
started receiving orders for its newly developed supercomputer that
has the world's fastest processing speed in a single processor, a
company spokesman said Wednesday.
   The highest performance version in the eight-model series FACOM
VP2000 has a processing speed of 4 gigaflops, or 4 billion floating
point operations per second (FLOPS), in a single processor,
spokesman Isao Hirano said.
   To date, a supercomputer with a capacity of 3 megaflops was
considered the fastest, Hirano said.
   He said Fujitsu's new supercomputers can also use the UNIX, a
popular operating system developed and licensed by American
Telephone and Telegraph Co., in addition to Fujitu's own operating
system, known as MSP.
   Fujitsu would not disclose the sales price of the new
supercomputers, but ``most of the usage of the new computers will be
in the form of rentals because of its expensive software,'' Hirano
said.
   Rental fees will range from 38 million Japanese yen, or around
$314,000, to 80 million yen, or $661,000, per month.
   Fujitsu, which unveiled Japan's first supercomputer, the FACOM
VP-100@200, in July 1982, expects to sell 200 new supercomputers
over the next four years, according to Hirano. The company began
receiving orders Tuesday, he said.
   Supercomputers are large, complex devices that perform a variety
of electronic chores at lightning speed. They have been mainly used
for scientific and technological calculations.

   A study by two Federal Reserve Bank economists
predicts increasing worldwide demand for oil will push OPEC
countries to full capacity and prices above $30 a barrel during the
1990s.
   But after adjusting for inflation, the higher price level will
still amount to only 60 percent to 80 percent of the peak price of
oil reached in 1981, according to an advance copy obtained Tuesday
of the study by economists Stephen Brown and Keith Phillips of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.

   Icahn's intentions were not known, and was not available to
comment, a secretary at his New York office said Tuesday. He
received the same clearance a year ago and apparently did not act on
it.
   Executives at USX's headquarters declined to comment on the
announcement from the Federal Trade Commission that Icahn had gotten

   A regulation to require anti-fume devices on

administration takes office, the Environmental Protection Agency
says.
   ``Our legal requirements are we have a public hearing, give two
weeks notice minimum, and the record be open for 30 days after the
hearing,'' said Dick Wilson, director of the EPA's office of mobile

   Speculation that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev would offer
dramatic peace initiatives enabling the United States to cut
military spending energized the financial markets, pushing down
interest rates, bolstering the dollar and rallying the Dow Jones
industrial average for the second straight day.
   Traders said rumors swept the markets Tuesday that Gorbachev, who
flew to New York to address the United Nations and confer with
President Reagan, would announce a significant proposal aimed at
letting both superpowers concentrate less on defense and more on
economics and trade.
   If so, traders reasoned, the United States would have more
flexibility in finding ways to reduce its staggering budget and
trade deficits, which the markets view as a fundamental risk to the
U.S. economy.
   The Gorbachev speculation was felt primarily in the bond market,
a sensitive barometer of inflation and interest rates. The
Treasury's closely watched 30-year issue surged more than $20 for
every $1,000 in face value and its yield tumbled to 8.9 percent from
9.12 percent late Monday. It was the largest one-day rally in about
three months.
   Declining interest rates, in turn, made stocks a more attractive
investment and pushed prices up sharply on Wall Street, where the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 25.60 points to 2,149.36.
That followed a 31.48 point jump Monday.
   The sudden enthusiasm for U.S. securities strengthened the dollar
as well, pushing it up against all major currencies.
   The market rallies eclipsed the other major economic event of the
day, the wide-ranging talks held by the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade in Montreal, where deadlocked talks on farm subsidies were
suspended with no progress reported.
   There was also little movement on other contentious issues: trade
in services such as banking and insurance, and protection of
intellectual property such as copyrights, patents and trademarks,
emissaries to the conference said.

West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled
12 cents higher Tuesday at $15.46 a barrel, after falling 30 cents

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny
Wall says he believes the worst is behind the troubled savings and
loan industry.
   ``There are fewer unprofitable institutions than there were last
year,'' Wall told the National Council of Savings Institutions at an
annual management conference Tuesday.
   He said that ``by the end of the month we will have dealt with
the worst cases'' of insolvent thrifts, and that with $30 billion
more his regulatory agency could tackle the others.
   But the council, which represents about 500 of the more
profitable savings banks and S&Ls nationwide, painted a more somber
picture of the industry Tuesday. They said Wall might be
underestimating the cost of removing the 511 insolvent thrifts
nationwide.
   The group says that one solution is to phase out the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures desposits of up to
$100,000 among the nation's thrifts and is currently in red ink, and
to use taxpayer money toward the clean-up costs.
   In a plan released last week and outlined again Tuesday, the
council said that healthy thrifts should be transferred to the more
stable Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the insurer of banks and
some S&Ls. Those that failed to meet the FDIC's stiffer capital
requirements would have five years to become healthy or shut down.
   That was the opposite of recommendations made last week by the
largest S&L trade group, the U.S. League of Savings Institutions,
which advocated preserving the current system.
   Many members of the league, though, are not healthy enough to
join the FDIC, which has substantially lower premiums, while about
two-thirds of the council's members already are insured by that
agency. No thrifts can switch to the FDIC now anyway because of a
moratorium imposed by Congress.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman was unavailable for comment
Tuesday. However, the American Bankers Association, the largest bank
trade group, criticized the council's proposal, saying the group
``wants to have its cake and eat it too; They want to leave the
problems of their industry behind ...''
   The National Council of Savings Institutions did not provide any
estimates for reaching its goals, although some members indicated it
would cost more than the $30 billion figure suggested by Wall.
   ``We think the problem is bigger than that,'' said Keith G.
Willoughby, chief executive officer of First Mutual of Boston.
   Charles John Koch, head of the First Federal Savings Bank in
Cleveland and council chairman, said, ``If that's the number that
solves the problem, great. (But) it's really immaterial. The cost is
clearly in excess of what the industry can pay by itself.''
   Estimates for dealing with the quarter of the 3,200 federally
insured S&Ls that are considered at or near insolvency lately have
ranged from $50 billion to $100 billion.
   Wall said that while shaky thrifts continue to drag down the
industry, the vast majority of all S&Ls are profitable because more
and more troubled thrifts have been restructured or merged with
healthy institutions.
   He said that industrywide net losses totaled $1.5 billion in the
third quarter, down from $3.8 billion in the second quarter and $3.9
billion in the first quarter.
   At the same time, the amount of federal income tax paid out by
the profitable thrifts has risen to $573 million in the third
quarter from $547 million in the second quarter and $490 million in
the first.
   Wall said that at the start of this year the bank board, which
regulates federally insured S&Ls, predicted 52 thrifts would be
restructured this year but, in fact, about 200 have been.

   The whiff of Wall Street may be enticing to
reform-minded Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, but he's way behind
his Chinese Communist rivals: a trio from the People's Republic has
been training in the heart of high-stakes capitalism for two months.
   The interns from the People's Bank of China are guests of the
nation's largest stock exchange, sent as part of a cooperation pact
signed two years ago enabling the Chinese to study how a
sophisticated securities market works.
   The Peking government began tolerating limited stock and bond
trading in 1985 after a 35-year ban on what was considered immoral
speculation that benefited the rich. The official position now is
that buying and selling securities play a useful role in the
country's modernization.
   ``We're only in the very beginning,'' said Zhang Zhiping, 32, a
senior official in the People's Bank's financial control department,
the rough equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission
because it regulates where and what type of securities can be sold.
   ``We have to develop trading firms and brokers, skilled
professionals,'' Zhang said. ``We have to educate the people on what
is a stock. We have to develop companies that issue securities. We
have to change all the systems.
   ``In China, if you want to do something, it takes a long time,''
he said. ``You can't build Rome in a day.''
   Zhang and his two colleagues, Duan Jining, 28, and Han Jianjun,
33, spoke highly of their experience in the heart of the Wall Street
jungle, where just in the past few months they have witnessed some
of the biggest corporate takeover brawls in history, the 1-year
anniversary of the Black Monday crash and the normal barrage of
market gossip that traders thrive on.
   ``We don't have such takeover business in China,'' said Han, an
executive in the People's Bank branch on southern Hainan Island, a
special zone for foreign trade and investment. ``The government
tells one company to buy another company. Bankers don't play much of
a role.''
   Although primitive over-the-counter markets for trading
company-issued securities have been allowed in about 70 Chinese
cities, there is no structure and few laws governing how they
operate, the three bankers said.
   Nevertheless, China is much more advanced in securities trading
than the Soviet Union, the other Communist superpower, where talk of
establishing stock and bond markets is still in its infancy.
   That raised speculation that Gorbachev's itinerary might include
a last-minute stopover at the NYSE during his New York visit,
although Big Board officials said no trip was planned as of late
Tuesday.
   The Chinese interns have spent much of their visit at the NYSE,
where they talk to floor traders, market makers, surveillance
officials and market economists. They also have spent time on the
trading floors at First Boston Corp., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
and Merrill Lynch & Co.
   When they go home later this month they will drag a few file
cabinets' worth of training manuals and textbooks with them, on
topics that range from stock-index futures to insider trading.
   ``I didn't know much about stocks and capital markets, it's very
useful,'' said Ms. Duan, a researcher in the People's Bank's
international department.
   Of particular interest to her, she said, were the
investor-protection safeguards in U.S. securities laws.
   ``The emphasis here is more on the buyer's side,'' she said. ``In
China, the emphasis is more on the seller's side.''
   If the billions of dollars that change hands on Wall Street is
staggering to most Americans, it is even more so for the three
visitors, who could not afford New York's cost of living unless they
stayed at an NYSE-leased apartment. Still, they are considered
highly paid in their home country.
   Zhang said he makes about 250 Chinese yuan a month, or about
$92.50 at current exchange rates _ lunch for two at Windows on the
World in downtown Manhattan. Duan and Han said they earn about 150
yuan a month, or $55.50 _ one ticket each to a Broadway show.
   ``The government takes more care of you in China, but it's still
not so good,'' Han said. ``The people don't have enthusiasm when
they get the same pay no matter how hard they work.''
   The Chinese interns said that despite the awesome problems of
establishing a rational securities trading system in their country,
they were confident it could work eventually but probably would not
resemble the U.S. system.
   ``We shouldn't take an example and exactly duplicate it,'' said
Zhang.

<HEAD>1990s To Be Decade Of Higher Oil Prices, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT McCARTNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The days of lower oil prices will end by 1992 and
the coming decade will be marked by higher prices that will slow
economic growth in the United States, a study by two economists at
the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas says.
   Stephen Brown and Keith Phillips contend that falling demand for
oil in the 1980s has had more to do with the collapse in oil prices
than the disarray in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   And, they say in a study to be published next month, that growing
demand in the 1990s will push OPEC countries to full capacity and
prices above $30 a barrel.
   ``People planning on building big cars in the next decade may be
headed in the wrong direction,'' Brown said in an interview. ``(But)
it won't be as bad as the the `70s where we saw sharp price
increases that really nailed the economy.''
   The economists said, however, that those in the currently
depressed oil business shouldn't begin dancing in the streets.
   After adjusting for inflation, the higher price level will still
amount to only 60 percent to 80 percent of the peak price of oil
reached in 1981, they said.
   By 1992, oil prices should begin rising. And by the year 2000,
oil prices will reach $35 to $40 a barrel _ or more than double the
current level, they predict.
   ``I really don't think we'll see a return to the boom times of
1981 in the oil industry,'' Brown said. ``But we should see some
increases as early as `92, barring OPEC action, and definitely by
`95. By 1995, the price will have to be in the neighborhood of $25
(a barrel) because of the demand.''
   In the United States alone, Brown and Phillips said, oil
consumption will increase between 2.1 percent and 9.5 percent
annually.
   Current price levels encourage consumption and discourage the
development of alternative resources or conservation efforts. In the
next decade, the growth of world economies will continue to spur
demand and pressure prices higher, the economists suggest.
   ``Under nearly all of our scenarios, the growth in oil
consumption pushes OPEC close to full capacity between late 1992 and
early 1995,'' said the study, which will be published in January in
the Fed's regional economic review. ``As OPEC nears full capacity,
prices are likely to rise sharply.''
   The study assumes no major disruptions in oil production or
artificial pushes, such as a resumption of the Iran-Iraq war or a
sharp increase in taxes on oil.
   ``Rising oil prices will strengthen economic growth in
energy-exporting countries while hindering economic growth in
energy-importing countries like the United States,'' the study says.
   And as in the past, the effects will cut unevenly through this
country.
   Energy-producing regions like Texas and Louisiana will benefit,
while energy-consuming areas like the Northeast will suffer.
   Currently, production of oil exceeds worldwide demand, thus
triggering the fall in prices to between $15 and $16 a barrel. Last
month OPEC agreed to try to limit its production and bolster oil
prices, but the cartel's past attempts at output restraint have
failed.

   Ten toys ranging from a $1 play sword to a
$100-plus motorized riding toy are dangerous and should be kept out
of children's reach, a child safety advocate says.
   ``Toys that maim and kill still flood the marketplace,'' lawyer
Edward Swartz said Tuesday in releasing his 17th annual ``10 Worst
Toys'' list and urging the government to impose stricter toy safety
standards.
   But a Consumer Product Safety Commission spokeswoman defended the
government's efforts to keep toys safe.
   ``We do what we can with the resources we have,'' said Anne
Pavlich. She said the government doesn't clear toys for sale, but
depends on people like Swartz ``to let us know which toys they feel
are not safe.''
   Manufacturers said at least two of the toys on this year's list
have been discontinued, but may still be on store shelves:
   _The ``Sweetheart'' battery-operated riding toy by Power Wheels,
which Swartz blasted for its potential speed of 5 mph and six-volt
rechargeable batteries housed in unsecured areas. The product was
dropped because it resembles the three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles
banned this year, said Kransco Corp. Vice President Chip Herman,
whose company marketed it.
   _The Battle Beasts Warrior Sword, discontinued because of poor
sales, said Bernie Epstein, senior vice president of Imperial Toy
Corp. of Los Angeles.
   One popular nursery toy made Swartz's list, the Johnny Jump Up
Baby Exerciser by Evenflo Juvenile Furniture Co. The swinglike seat
is clamped to the top of a doorway, and Swartz said an infant could
severely injure itself by hitting the side of the doorway.
   Evenflo officials did not return telephone calls from The
Associated Press.
   Toy weapons under fire included Guarantee Distributors' .22
Caliber Pellet Firing Target Pistol and the Challenger Rubberband
Target Shooter, made by Artner Corp. of Boisie, Ind., which can
shoot a rubber band up to 25 feet.
   Attack Force, Strombecker Corp.'s motorized cap machine pistol,
carries warnings that it should not be fired closer than one foot to
the ear, should not be used without adult supervision and that its
roll caps may be hazardous if misused. Swartz said a toy with those
warnings shouldn't be sold at all.
   Strombecker President Dan Shure said the product isn't dangerous
if used correctly.
   Guarantee Distributors officials did not return a telephone call
and an attempt to reach Artner for a response was unsuccessful
because the company's phone number has been disconnected.
   Swartz said four toys made the list because of small parts that
could choke a child:
   _``My Train,'' a wooden train set made by Montgomery Schoolhouse
of Vermont.
   _A Burger King Cheeseburger Set made by Multi Toys Corp.
   _Paddington's 30th Anniversary Bear, manufactured by Eden Toys
Inc.
   _My Ladybird First Pull-Along Puzzle made by Berchet.
   Daniel E. Woodward, one of Mongtgomery Schoolhouse's owners, said
the train set meets all federal safety standards.
   Leonard Gilman, vice president of sales for Multi Toys, said the
cheeseburger set was tested by Lab Test Hong Kong Ltd. to meet U.S.
safety standards.
   Eden Toys Chairman David Miller said the bear is safe and has
passed all standards.
   Berchet did not return phone calls seeking comment.

<HEAD>ITT Fined $200,000 For Guilty Plea In Fraud Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ITT Corp. has received a $200,000 federal fine for
treating Air Force officials to golf games, sports and theater
tickets and meals to obtain confidential government information used
to bid on $180 million in military contracts.
   U.S. District Judge David S. Nelson handed down the fine Tuesday
to the New York-based conglomerate, which pleaded guilty in October
to one count of conspiring to defraud the government. ITT had faced
a maximum possible fine of $500,000.
   ITT admitted that an employee in its defense technology division
in 1984 and early 1985 spent about $15,000 and was reimbursed for
illegal gifts to Air Force officials at Hanscom Air Force Base in
Bedford, Mass.
   In exchange, ITT received copies of internal government documents
with confidential procurement information on two Air Force programs
ITT was interested in purchasing.
   ``It was a plea bargain situation,'' ITT spokesman James
Gallagher said. ``We agreed to plead guilty to one charge of fraud,
the government agreed to drop three other charges.''
   ITT was indicted in June 1987, several months before a separate
federal investigation into the use of consultants by corporations to
get information for use in bidding on contracts.
   Edward M. Vincenzi, a senior marketing representative of ITT's
Van Nuys, Calif.-based Gilfillan subsidiary, which specializes in
radar technology, pleaded guilty to the same charge.
   He received a 1-year suspended sentence and was placed on
probation for one year. Vincenzi, who cooperated with federal
authorities, had faced up to 35 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
   Federal prosecutors charged that ITT Gilfillan executives tacitly
approved of attempts by Vincenzi to defraud the government and later
tried to cover up his activities by destroying or concealing Air
Force documents.
   According to the indictment in the case, Vincenzi was hired in
1983 to pursue two Air Force contracts _ an anti-radiation missile
decoy system valued at more than $80 million and a mobile air
traffic control radar system worth between $100 million and $150
million.
   His job was to get inside information on the programs, including
Air Force plans, specifications, procurement strategy and projected
costs, the indictment said.
   Four government employees at the Air Force's Electronics Systems
Division at Hanscom who received gratuities from Vincenzi gave him
copies of documents with information on the contracts, as well as
general planning and funding documents.
   Vincenzi then sent the documents to Gilfillan executives. ITT won
a preliminary $6.4 million development contract for the missile
decoy system, which was never built.
   He met with one Hanscom official several times and bought him
lunches, paid for him to play golf and gave him theater and sports
tickets and liquor, the indictment said. The gratuities were worth
$15,000, the government said.

<HEAD>America's `Chicken Big' Says Soviet Poultry Too Thin</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chickens sold in the Soviet Union are so
scrawny that shoppers joke the poultry is starved to death rather
than slaughtered, and even Frank Perdue says he can't help until the
emaciated birds are fed better.
   Perdue, who picked over the poultry during a visit to Moscow's
famous G.U.M. department store on Red Square last week, politely
referred to the chickens he saw as ``lean'' and ``narrow-breasted.''
   ``The chickens lack protein,'' concluded Perdue, chairman and
chief promoter of Perdue Farms Inc., the United States'
fourth-largest poultry producer.
   Soviet chickens make do with 15 percent corn feed plus wheat and
barley, while Perdue says he feeds his birds on a diet of nearly 60
percent corn.
   Their diet isn't likely to improve soon since both corn and high
protein soybeans require a warmer climate than found in most of the
Soviet Union, said Donald W. Mabe, president and chief executive of
Perdue Farms.
   ``They could buy corn on the world market, but what could they
use to pay for it?'' he asked. ``All their vodka is taken up by
Pepsi Cola.''
   Mabe was referring to the obstacle facing Western companies: the
fact that Soviet rubles are not convertible on the world market,
thus forcing most firms to barter one commodity for another.
   The Soviets have few goods to sell, and Pepsi Cola sewed up world
demand for its vodka 15 years ago with a deal that sends soft drink
syrup to the Soviet Union in exchange for Stolichnaya vodka.
   Still, a visit to a market makes it clear the Soviet Union could
use Perdue's help. Soviet chickens are so tough that few will bake
them.
   One solution by local cooks is impaling the chicken on a glass
milk bottle filled with water. The bird and bottle are balanced in
the oven and the chicken is steamed from the inside out while it
bakes. The recipe is called ``Chicken on a Bottle.''
   Perdue said chickens could be the answer to the Soviet Union's
perennial food shortage, as the birds require only two pounds of
feed to produce a pound of meat _ twice as efficient as hogs, and
more than three times as efficient as producing beef.
   Perdue, along with his father, built the company from a few dozen
chickens into an operation with sales of $964 million in 1986-87
that distributes poultry products along the East Coast from Maine to
North Carolina. At age 67, he stepped down last summer as chief
executive, with Mabe taking over that job.
   Perdue and Mabe visited the national Poultry Breeding Institute
north of Moscow in Ptitsagrad, or ``Poultry City.''
   They found that Soviet breeding methods were quite advanced.
   Wrapped in orange nylon capes and booties to prevent the spread
of infection, they found the barns barely lighted but cleaner than
the average Soviet street.
   They even picked up a few ideas for their own operations. They
discovered that the Soviets ration water to the birds, slowing their
digestion and resulting in more chicken for less feed.
   However, the Soviets' scientific expertise seldom is followed at
the mass production level.
   Some chicks are fed rotten fruits and vegetables from local
produce packagers and processing consists of stuffing plastic bags
with whole hens that often are not quite plucked or gutted.
   The hens at G.U.M. contrasted starkly with the packages of
barbecued chicken breasts, precooked chicken nuggets and fillets
that Perdue brought along from the United States and gave to his
hosts.
   Perdue and Mabe indicated that if a business deal results from
their trip, it likely would be a sale of Perdue-designed equipment
to handle the cleaning, cutting and filleting that is largely
ignored in the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Stock Moves On FTC Announcement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Financier Carl Icahn has been cleared by the
Federal Trade Commission to boost his 11.4 percent stake in USX
Corp., but his intentions remain unclear.
   Executives at USX's headquarters declined to comment on Tuesday's
announcement, while a secretary at Icahn & Co. in New York said
Icahn was unavailable for comment.
   FTC spokeswoman Susan Ticknor said the agency reported Tuesday in
the Federal Register that on Nov. 25 it granted Icahn an early
release from restrictions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act affecting his
further purchase of USX stock. The act enables federal regulators to
review antitrust implications of major stock purchases.
   The Pittsburgh-based company's stock rose $1.25 to $29 a share
after the announcement, then settled back to $28.50, up 75 cents for
the day on the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``I think it's a lot to do about nothing,'' said steel analyst
Charles Bradford at the investment firm Merrill Lynch & Co. ``One
thing is pretty clear, that Icahn's postion at USX, although it
looks better today than it did yesterday ... isn't one of his better
investments.''
   Bradford said Icahn bought the stock at $23 or $24 per share.
   Icahn will have a year from Nov. 25 to buy additional stock
without reapplying for FTC permission, Ticknor said.
   Andrew Gray, an oil analyst for the investment firm Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette, ``Icahn now has more flexibility or apparent
flexibility than he had before this release.''
   But Icahn has shown little inclination to move against the
company since acquiring his shares and threatening in October 1986
to make a tender offer for USX.
   ``He showed an extreme amount of patience. I never really
believed it would go this long. It's over two years,'' Gray said.
   Since Icahn appeared on the scene, USX has announced plans to
sell its transportation division and certain real estate, but has
not unveiled any major corporate restructuring to fend off an
unwanted takeover attempt.
   ``I don't think that's what people are looking for,'' Gray said.
``We're looking for bigger things. If you look at USX stock in the
energy group, it's probably been one of the worst performers ... in
1988.''
   Higher crude oil prices and renewed profitability at USX's steel
division could make the stock attractive to investors, and the
company-mandated retirement of Chairman David Roderick in May could
be misinterpreted as a chink in USX's armor, Gray said.
   In addition, Icahn could raise additional money if Texaco Inc.
follows through on suggestions it will reward shareholders in the
first quarter, he said.

<HEAD>Expectations On U.S.-Soviet Talks Push Shares To Record High</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Expectations of progress in U.S.-Soviet talks on
arms reduction pushed share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today
past 30,000 points for the first time ever. The U.S. dollar rose
moderately against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at
30,050.82 after gaining 381.44 points, or 1.29 percent. The index
advanced throughout the day, then shot up 263.41 points in the final
hour of trading.
   ``Expectations of higher prices in the market were really strong
as the index approached the 30,000-point mark,'' said a dealer at
Daiwa Securities.
   ``Market players seemed to be buying issues simply in order to
achieve a 30,000-point Nikkei,'' said another trader with a major
securities firm.
   ``I knew the index would make the 30,000-point mark sooner or
later, but its gain at the last moment was just amazing,'' said the
trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   An analyst at Nomura Securities said the Nikkei's big gain in
Tokyo followed an overnight rise in the Dow Jones industrial average
in New York.
   ``Traders speculated that the Reagan-Gorbachev talks might lead
to arms reduction, and they thought a cut in arms spending would
reduce U.S. deficits,'' he said.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev is visiting the United States,
where he will meet President Reagan and address the U.N. General
Assembly.
   Market participants were also encouraged by Tuesday's
announcement that Japan's gross national product jumped 9.3 percent
on an annual basis during the July to September quarter, after a 3.3
percent annual rate contraction in the April to June quarter, the
analyst said.
   The measure of the value of the nation's goods and services rose
2.2 percent over the previous quarter.
   On the foreign exchange market, investors bought dollars
following the currency's overnight rise on Wall Street, dealers said.
   The dollar's strength in New York was believed to be largely due
to expectations that the United States and Soviet Union would reach
an agreement on reducing conventional military forces.
   Recent bearish sentiment toward the dollar on the Tokyo market
has eased because of the U.S.-Soviet talks, said Takamasa Yamasaki
of Daiwa Bank.
   ``The dollar is no longer bearish. Many speculative investors
were increasingly buying the currency, outweighing selling by some
trading companies,'' Yamasaki said.
   The dollar was also helped by speculation that the U.S. budget
deficit would shrink if the United States cuts military spending,
said a dealer at the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Michael Boskin, chief economic adviser to President-elect George
Bush, reportedly said Bush will ``take strong action on the deficit
on the spending side of the budget.''
   Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said at a regular press
conference today that currency rates have stabilized but that
Japan's central bank remains willing to take appropriate measures
whenever necessary, a bank official said.
   The Nikkei now stands about 13 percent above the pre-crash high
of 26,646 points marked on Oct. 14, 1987, while the Dow Jones
industrial average on the New York Stock Exchange is struggling to
regain crash losses more than 13 months after Black Monday.
   Despite optimistic prospects, cautious analysts warned share
prices are way beyond the market's own energy and expressed concern
about a possible plunge.
   ``What goes up is destined to come down some time,'' said Josen
Takahashi, a chief analyst at Mitsubishi Research Institute, a noted
think tank in Tokyo.
   He said the current market strength is caused by a huge sum of
funds poured into stocks by land speculators looking for new targets
of investment after land prices peaked last year.
   Once the funds were withdrawn from the market, he said, stocks
could suffer a major setback.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have launched a full-scale investigation
of two trading firms alleged to have illegally exported sensitive
chemical solutions to the Soviet Union, trade ministry officials
said Wednesday.
   The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Daikin
Industries, an Osaka-based air conditioner manufacturer, and Tokyo
Boeki, a small trading house, exported 860 tons of high-density
halogenated hydrocarbon to the Soviet Union in 1986 and 1987 without
ministry permission.
   Exporting such a solution in concentrated form to the Soviet
Union or other communist nations is prohibited under Japanese export
control laws and international agreements among Western members of
the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Control, or COCOM.
   COCOM is an international watchdog body regulating the flow of
high technology products from Western nations to the communist bloc.
The body, however, does not directly intervene in members' trade
practices nor impose penalities against violators.
   In an earlier case, Toshiba Machine Co. was accused of selling
sophisticated milling equipment to the Soviet Union in 1986, also in
violation of COCOM regulations.
   The Toshiba incident led to tough criticism from the United
States, which claimed the equipment helped the Soviets build
quieter, harder to detect submarines. Washington later slapped
severe sanctions on Toshiba Machine and prohibited the company from
exporting to the United States for three years, beginning in 1988.
   In the wake of the Toshiba Machine incident in 1986, the trade
ministry strengthened its export control sections. Last year, the
trade ministry implicated three traders for illegally exporting
high-tech digital equipment to China.
   The Osaka Prefectural Police, notified by the trade ministry,
searched Daikin and Tokyo Boeki offices Wednesday morning.
   The ministry filed charges with Osaka police against the company
for violating the Foreign Exchange Law by exporting the chemical,
known as Halon-2402, with a purity of more than 99.8 percent by
declaring it to be of lower purity.
   Daikin executive Noriyuki Inoue said at a hastily called news
conference that the company did not deliberately export any illegal
products.
   ``It was the result of our deficient management, and we promise
we will never repeat the same mistake,'' he said.
   Halon-2402 is 99.95 percent pure when it is produced, and it had
to be diluted with other chemicals to meet COCOM regulations, he
said.
   Daikin, which had been exporting Halon-2402 to the Soviet Union
for use in fire extinguishers on fishing boats since 1979, said it
has exported about 900 tons of Halon-2402 for about $3.28 million in
1986-87 through Tokyo Boeki.
   Daikin stopped exporting the chemical in August, when it found
the product violated COCOM regulations, the Daikin official said. He
said Daikin would discontinue producing Halon-2402.
   Analysts said the trade ministry's action indicated its
determination to strictly clamp down on illegal exports of sensitive
goods to the communist nation.
   ``I take it as something like a hello call to President-elect
Bush,'' said Kazuhisa Ogawa, a defense analyst and noted author on
U.S.-Japan military relations.
   Halogenated hydrocarbon is a fluoric compound, commonly used in
fire extinguishers. But it can also be used as a coolant for guided
missiles, Ogawa said.
   Ogawa said the timing of the trade ministry's action, ahead of a
visit by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, stresses
Japan's loyalty to the United States. Shevardnadze is scheduled to
visit Tokyo on Dec. 19 for talks with Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita and Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno.

   The European Economic Community said
Wednesday it started legal proceedings against Spain for failing to
open its tobacco industry to outside competition.
   In a statement, the EEC's executive commission said Spain should
have set quotas for the import of tobacco from the 11 other member
states as soon as the country joined the EEC in 1s had not been taken.
   Under the terms of Spain's entry, the government was due to end
the country's tobacco monopoly by Dec. 31, 1991.
   If Spain does not take measures to open up its tobacco industry,
the commission can take the case to the European Court of Justice.

   Taiwan's trade surplus shrank slightly in
November, the government reported Wednesday.
   Last months' surplus fell to $1.15 billion from $1.21 billion in
October and $1.51 billion in November 1987, according to the
ccounting and Statistics.
   Exports in November totaled $5.45 billion, up 0.9 percent over
the previous month and up 5.1 percent from last year. Imports
reached $4.31 billion, up from $4.19 billion in October and $3.67
billion last year.
   For the first 11 months, Taiwan registered a total surplus of
$9.76 billion, down 45.17 percent from the same period last year.

   Westinghouse Electric Corp. said Wednesday it
has agreed to sell its Unimation robot and automation business to
Staubli International AG of Zurich, Switzerland.
   Westinghouse acquired Unimation for $107 million in 1983.
Unimation had been the nation's largest maker of industrial robots,
with headquarters in Danbury, Conn., and several hundred employees.
   Staubli International is a privately owned manufacturer of
programmable mechanisms for the textile industry, and its robotics
division makes a line of material handling systems.
   Westinghouse spokesman Jay McCaffrey confirmed the sale, but
withheld details, saying it had agreed with Staubli not to announce
the deal until Thursday. The Pittsburgh Press said Wednesday that
the sale was announced Tuesday to Westinghouse employees.
   Unimation installed the world's first industrial robot in 1961,
and in 1983 its share of that market was estimated at 40 percent
with sales of more than $71 million.
   More than 50 competitors entered the field by 1982 looking for a
share of a market that some analysts had predicted would grow to $2
billion in annual sales by 1992. The failure of those predictions
led to a number of firms being sold or closed.
   Just after Westinghouse acquired Unimation, the market shifted to
electrically powered robots from the hydraulic models built by
Unimation. The company responded to the switch, but lost business to
a joint venture formed in 1982 by General Motors Corp. and Fanuc
Ltd. of Japan.

   The stock market showed a modest gain today,
struggling to extend its sharp rally over the past two sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose more than 57
points Monday and Tuesday, picked up another 4.98 to 2,154.34 by 11
a.m. today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 649 up, 509 down and
551 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 54.29 million shares at
midmorning.
   The dollar rose, interest rates fell and stock prices climbed
Tuesday on the strength of talk that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
might make some dramatic announcement of military reductions during
his current visit to the United States.
   A move in that direction would presumably open the way for the
United States to cut its defense spending, reducing inflationary
pressures and narrowing the government's budget deficit.
   This morning, however, analysts said traders were proceeding
cautiously, waiting to see whether those hopes were justified.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone & Telegraph
rose [ to 29|; Sears Roebuck gained [ to 40], and General Electric
was unchanged at 45|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.38 to 156.16. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .17 at 297.19.

Wednesday they had bought the company for $217 million.
   Finlay had been part of the company Seligman & Latz Inc., which
was taken private in 1985 and which also operates beauty salons and
cosmetic departments in stores.
   Harold Green, who led the original buyout of Seligman & Latz,
will serve as chairman of a new holding company, Finlay Enterprises

Seligman & Latz, will serve in those positions in the new firm.
   Westinghouse Credit Corp. provided financing for the transaction.
   Finlay has more than 500 leased jewelry concessions in more than

   What should you do with those odd socks that drive
you mad? You know, the leftover halves of pairs that have vanished
inexplicably in the laundry.
   ``You should dispose of them and buy a new pair,'' says
32-year-old, sock magnate Sophie Mirman. ``They are absolutely not a
trend that will catch on.''
   The Anglo-French Ms. Mirman has more than a passing interest in
the matter. She is chairman and co-founder of Sock Shop
International PLC, a chain of specialty stores that sell socks of
almost every sort.
   They come in one shape, but Sock Shop offers them in many sizes
and colors. And patterns. Lots of patterns.
   Ms. Mirman got the idea for Sock Shops when she trudged around
London about six years ago looking for a pair of cream-colored
tights to match an outfit.
   ``I went to every single department store to find them. It seemed
like a very inefficient way to buy an everyday necessity,'' she
recalled.
   Ms. Mirman and her business partner, Richard Ross, opened their
first Sock Shop in the Knightsbridge subway station, right near
Harrods department store, in April 1983.
   Married in 1984, the couple now oversee a growing empire of 110
Sock Shops. They have expanded into France, Belgium and the the
United States, with 12 Sock Shops in New York City and more opening
in East Coast shopping malls.
   She is a prime example of the growing number of self-starting
entrepreneurs who have blossomed in the capitalist revolution Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher has brought to Britain.
   Her company has gone public and last year added the government's
Company of the Year Award to a growing array of prizes. Her shops,
in black, red and white design, have become part of the London
cityscape.
   Ms. Mirman is short and pale, with cropped brown hair, red-rimmed
glasses and a quick wit beneath a subdued manner.
   She is the only child of French parents who eloped because their
own parents disapproved of the match, and arrived in England in the
1940s, speaking no English.
   Her mother, Simone Mirman, is a royal milliner, and her late
father was an executive for Christian Dior in Britain.
   Ms. Mirman was educated at the French Lycee in London and went on
to do a bilingual secretarial course, because ``it was socially
acceptable. It seemed the thing to do.''
   She then joined Marks and Spencer PLC, a leading British retailer
where even Mrs. Thatcher shops and which is fondly known by its
rhyming cockney nickname ``Marks and Sparks.''
   But as she puts it dryly, ``I didn't find the typing pool
particularly stimulating.''
   She became secretary to Lord Sieff, then chairman of Marks and
Spencer, and displayed her chutzpah.
   ``I told him categorically I would become the first woman
director of Marks and Spencer, and he didn't laugh,'' Ms. Mirman
said.
   Sieff encouraged the young woman to enter the company's
management training program and she worked in several of the chain's
stores, including the Paris branch.
   Eventually, Ms. Mirman became restless and looked for something
new in 1981. She found a job with Tie Rack, a chain of tie shops,
where she became managing director within three months.
   But after two years, she said: ``I decided if I was going to work
so hard, I might as well work for myself.''
   Ms. Mirman and Ross, who was finance director of Tie Rack, needed
45,000 pounds (about $82,000) for their enterprise and approached a
number of venture capitalists offering them a 49 percent stake.
   Nobody was interested. But today Ms. Mirman is grateful _ the
stake is now worth about $55 million.
   ``We thank all those people,'' she said.
   Ms. Mirman and Ross opened that first Knightsbridge shop with a
government-guaranteed loan and about $2,000 each of their own money.
Six months later, they opened another shop in London.
   ``We had no ideas of grandeur in those first days. In our wildest
dreams we thought we might have five or six shops,'' Ms. Mirman said.
   An early franchising experiment failed, so the couple decided to
operate all its shops alone.
   ``We found it very difficult to control the quality standards''
in franchises, Ms. Mirman said. ``We prefer to expand perhaps more
slowly, but fully in control of the operations.''
   The company grew quite quickly in Britain, then elsewhere in
Europe, and Ms. Mirman set her sights further afield.
   ``America held a great fascination for us,'' she said, partly
because ``women had this strange habit of wearing their socks over
their pantyhose.''
   She was referring to the practice of women wearing socks and
sneakers over stockings while they travel to and from work.
   ``The idea of double sales was too good to miss,'' she said
jokingly.
   Sock Shop went public in March 1987, selling $4.6 million worth
of shares on the London Stock Exchange's Unlisted Securities Market,
a secondary market designed for smaller companies.
   The stock, which was offered at about $2 per share, doubled on
its first day of trading and is now hovering at about the same
level. Ms. Mirman and Ross retain an 80 percent holding.
   The company, which employs 750 people, had net profit of $1.8
million on revenue of $26 million in the year ended September 1987.
The 1988 results will be reported in January.
   At its south London headquarters, the atmosphere is informal,
crowded and cluttered.
   ``We try to have a very open company. The ideas come through
discussion,'' Ms. Mirman said. Marketing decisions are based on gut
feeling, she said.
   She has abandoned her ambition of becoming Marks and Sparks'
first female director, and Sieff has become a director on her own
board.
   Ms. Mirman and Ross have a 26-month-old daughter and a
9-month-old son and ``a very good nanny.'' The family lives in
London, and Ms. Mirman squeezes in skiing and tennis when she can.
   ``We have a rule when we're away from the business not to talk
about Sock Shop,'' Ms. Mirman said. ``But it's impossible.''
   Envisioning more than 1,000 Sock Shops in her future, Ms. Mirman
said: ``There's a long way to go yet with socks.''

<TEXT>
   China is moving its fledgling auto industry into
overdrive, thanks to the influx of foreign money and technology, but
the goal of challenging other world leaders in the industry is still
a long way off.
   This year China will make up to 560,000 vehicles, all trucks and
buses except for 30,000 passenger cars. By the year 2000, passenger
car output is expected to jump from 700,000 to 1 million.
   By contrast, more than 15 million cars and light trucks were sold
in the United States in the 1988 model year.
   The increase in Chinese production will come about almost
entirely through joint ventures with foreign automakers, with the
focus on three ``production bases'' in the northeast city of
Changchun, Shanghai and central China's Hubei province.
   The challenge of satisfying the groe committed to using more local
parts, but
localization is generally only around 25-30 percent because of
difficulty in finding Chinese suppliers with quality goods.
   Michel de Riviere, deputy manager of the commercial division of
Guangzhou (Canton) Peugeot Automobile, said local content of only 6
percent in his plant is one reason their small station wagons have a
price tag of $20,000, equivalent to more than 60 years of a Chinese
worker's annual pay. They hope local parts will reach 20 percent
next year, he said.
   Riviere said it takes five Chinese workers to do the job of one
in most foreign factories because of low technology levels.
   ``The workers are bright and capable,'' he said, but the industry
``is still in a very early stage.''
   Chen acknowledged that the industry, which employs 1.5 million
people, ``probably has the lowest productivity rate in the world.''
   Chen said China, which now sells about $30 million in the $40
billion-a-year world auto-component market, hopes to export more
parts and eventually plans to sell some vehicles abroad.
   But he stressed the main purpose of entering overseas markets
will be to raise China's competitive levels in cost, service and
quality.
   Chrysler Chairman Iacocca, during an October visit, agreed that
improved quality is a must for the Chinese industry. He said he told
his Chinese partners, ``you must get quality up. Quality comes up,
productivity comes up, costs go down and the world will recognize
you as an exporter. If you don't do that, you can't play.''

<TEXT>
   As Mikhail S. Gorbachev maneuvers between
conservatives and radicals to shake up the Soviet government and
economy, China's reform experience can serve as both an
encouragement and a warning to him.
   Free markets, private enterprise and incentives have tremendously
stimulated China's backward economy and for the most part ended food
shortages _ also goals of President Gorbachev.
   But a decade into its economic reforms, China faces its worst
inflation in 30 years, irrational growth patterns, provinces and
cities that ignore central directives and rampant black marketeering.
   Chinese leaders say they are at a turning point, and that only if
these problems are overcome can they proceed with more advanced
reforms in prices, wages and other areas.
   Although China and the Soviet Union have many differences,
experts from both countries say the Chinese experience can yield
lessons for Gorbachev.
   ``It is impossible for them (the Soviets) to avoid all mistakes,
they can only hope to make fewer mistakes'' than China, said Liu
Qingjian, an economist at China's Institute of Soviet and East
European Studies.
   China began its reforms in 1978, when the thrice-purged
revolutionary veteran Deng Xiaoping gained control of the Communist
Party following the death in 1976 of Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
   Deng focused on reorganizing the economy _ breaking up communes
in favor of family farming,   ...
   Only in 1987 did China begin systematic government reorganization
and make limited concessions to democracy, such as multi-candidate
balloting in party-controlled elections. Political discussion
remained tightly limited.
   Gorbachev, who rose to power on the death of Soviet leader
Konstantin Chernenko in 1985, took the opposite approach. Unlike
China, where the political and economic chaos of the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution left many people open to change, the Soviet
Union presented him with a suspicious public as well as strong
political opposition.
   Gorbachev's method has been to open Soviet society to
unprecedented, frank criticism of the status quo, while proposing
constitutional changes in the presidency and parliament that would
strengthen his hand against opponents.
   But Soviet experts at China's Institute of Soviet and East
European Studies maintained in recent interviews that Gorbachev's
glasnost, or openness, has succeeded in enthusing only a handful of
intellectuals.
   To win over ordinary Soviets, they said, Gorbachev must take a
leaf from Deng's book and offer tangible benefits.
   Most of Gorbachev's economic proposals, including leasing farm
land ton,'' said
economist Liu.
   Free markets, at the heart of China's new prosperity, are
small-scale and expensive for consumers in the Soviet Union.
   A shopper in a typical Chinese city can choose from dozens of
small vendors, private and state-run, in buying a wide array of
fresh fruit and vegetables. Soviet shoppers often wait in long lines
for scant selections.
   ``If Gorbachev cannot improve the well-being of the Soviet people
... his position and his reforms will be weakened,'' said political
scientist Zhu Ruizhen.
   Deng tackled his reforms in one area at a time. He waited until
the breakup of communes had been justified by several good harvests
before making changes in the industrial sector.
   But Anton Vassiliev, an economist and first secretary at the
Soviet Embassy in Beijing, said this piecemeal approach has caused
many of China's current economic problems.
   ``This is perhaps one of the important exssiliev said.
   For example, Chinese factory owners buy most of their raw
materials at prices set by supply and demand, but face state
ceilings when they sell their products. They have authority to hire
and fire but only the most rudimentary of labor markets exists.
   Dozens of Chinese provincial and city governments have been
authorized to borrow money for capital construction projects, but
bankers have no corresponding power to regulate credit.
   Market confusion, flourishing black markets and steadily rising
inflation, now officially pegged at 26 percent, are among the
results.
   Vassiliev said Moscow has put greater emphasis on planning
coordinated change in various sectors.
   China also offers a lesson in the dangers of decentralizing too
much, he said.
   Cities and provinces given special economic autonomy have
developed rapidly, but they also have duplicated projects
unnecessarily and competed for scarce raw materials, fueling
inflation.
   When Chinese leaders this fall ordered a slowdown to curb
inflation, many local governments ignored the order.
   In agriculture, too, China may have decentralized too much.
Family farming has been popular but it has hampered the introduction
of machines and high-tech methods needed to increase yields.
   The Soviet Union has no comparable special economic zones,
although some economists have proposed them. However, Gorbachev has
already witnessed reform's splintering effects, as nationalists in
the Soviet Baltic states have taken advantage of glasnost to press
for political autonomy.
   China's Soviet experts said the turmoil created by Gorbachev's
political restructuring reveals a volatility in the Soviet
population that may make later economic reforms much more difficult
than in China.
   ``The Chinese people are more obedient,'' said political
scientist Wang Qi. ``If the Soviet Union were experiencing the
(economic) problems China has now, there would be riots.''
   Both countries have a stake in each other's reforms.
   Chinese intellectuals hope that if Gorbachev's political reforms
work, it will give a push to promoters of glasnost in China.
   If China's economic programs succeed, said Vassiliev, ``it will
generally show that socialism does have potential for development
and that the problems that exist now in Soviet society can be
solved.''

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. says it has extended
billions of dollars of additional credit to 10 million Sears
charge-card holders in hopes of boosting holiday sales and clearing
out inventory.
   The aggressive move by the nation's largest retailer comes amid
price-cutting by many merchants to spur sales for the important
Christmas selling season.
   Sears said Tuesday that in the past month it has notified 10
million cardholders, or 40 percent of all active Sears-charge
accounts, that their credit limits had been raised by an average of
50 percent.
   The customers were chosen because they were deemed both
creditworthy and likely to use the extra credit, Sears said.
   The company said it also lengthened the repayment period for
those accounts to 36 months from 30 months, thereby reducing minimum
monthly payments by at least 20 percent.
   Sears had $13 billion in loans outstanding to its store card
holders, or an average of about $515 an account, at the end of 1987.
   Although Sears made the move ``to enable customers to have more
purchasing power at Sears stores in the holidays,'' the extra credit
is permanent and not just available during the holiday season, the
company said.

<TEXT>
   Managers of Holly Farms Corp., intent on
pursuing a proposed merger with ConAgra Inc. of Omaha, Neb.,
rejected another buyout bid today from rival poultry processor Tyson
Foods Inc. of Springdale, Ark.
   The rejection was the latest development in a takeover attempt
begun by Tyson in October.
   ``The proposed merger with ConAgra is superior to Tyson's cash
and stock proposals,'' Holly Farms president R. Lee Taylor said in a
statement.
   Tyson has offered cash and a stock exchange to Holly Farms
shareholders that the Arkansas company values at $1.1 billion. Tyson
offered $54 a share in a hostile takeover or a cash-plus-stock deal
valued at $57 a share in a friendly merger.
   Holly Farms' board of directors urged the company's shareholders
to reject those offers and to go along with the ConAgra proposal
announced last month.
   The ConAgra merger approved by the Holly Farms board calls for an
exchange of stock valued at $1 billion. The per-share value of that
deal would depend on market prices at the time ConAgra and Holly
Farms stockholders approved the arrangement. At the time the
proposal was announced, the value of the merger to Holly Farms
stockholders would have been about $55 a share.
   Tyson has filed suit in state court in Wilmington, Del., to block
Holly Farms' merger with Conagra.
   Tyson is the nation's largest poultry processor and Holly Farms
is the second largest. Holly Farms' proposed merger with ConAgra
would make ConAgra the largest.

   The stock market advanced slightly today in a

<HEAD>Former Beatrice Chairman Forms New Venture with Salomon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald P. Kelly, former chairman of Beatrice Co.
and a near-legendary dealmaker, has formed a new limited partnership
designed to acquire businesses that can be bought for as much as $1
billion.
   The investment firm Salomon Inc. will be a permanent partner to
D.P. Kelly & Associates, arranging financing and finding investors
for Kelly's new pursuits, Kelly said Tuesday.
   ``We provide the managerial skills,'' Kelly said. ``We don't have
to worry about where we're going to get the equity. They (Salomon)
find it. ... We aren't involved with all the transactions they'll
do, but they'll be involved with everything we do.''
   Kelly said he wants to start another conglomerate from scratch,
as he did with Swift meats in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   He renamed the company Esmark as it acquired and sold off
companies ranging from personal care to industrial products to food
and automotive products.
   Esmark was acquired by Chicago-based Beatrice in 1984.
   Less than two years later, Kelly acquired Beatrice in a $6.2
billion leveraged buyout backed by a New York investment firm,
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
   The deal, the largest of its kind at the time, was financed by
selling off almost all of the food conglomerate's businesses.
   Kelly said he left Beatrice because he ran out of things to do.
   ``There were no major acquisitions or dispositions to do and for
them to pay me the kind of money they were to sit in my office was
ridiculous,'' he said.
   Kohlberg Kravis recently acquired RJR Nabisco in a $25 billion
leveraged buyout.
   Kelly said his plans are much more modest, but that Kelly &
Associates might be interested in smaller businesses RJR may spin
off after that sale is completed.
   ``We now happen to believe there are areas below the multibillion
deal where we can build a company not too dissimilar to what Esmark
did, and not too dissimilar to what Beatrice was,'' Kelly said.
   ``I would say we're looking for acquisitions in the $50 million
to $500 million range without any problem, but we're probably skewed
more toward the $1 billion deal.''
   Kelly, 66, retired as Beatrice's chairman in August, though he
still sits on the board of directors.
   He has worked on deals with Salomon for 25 years, but said the
new partnership ``is not going to be a single transaction type of
relationship'' like his reportedly stormy one with Kohlberg Kravis
at Beatrice.

<HEAD>EEC Car Sales Likely To Hit Record In 1988, Industry Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Car and truck sales in the European
Economic Community are likely to hit a record high this year but
sales might dip in 1989, an auto industry group said Wednesday.
   President of the Liaison Committee of the EEC Motor Vehicle
Manufacturing Industry Gregorio Rampa told reporters new car sales
would probably exceed 11.7 million in 1988, about 4 percent more
than last year.
   It marked the fourth year in a row demand had increased in the
12-nation trade bloc.
   Demand was likely to remain relatively strong in 1989 and 1990
although sales might be lower than in 1988, Rampa said.
   Automakers increased production in 1988 as a result of the strong
demand in Europe while imports remained at about 1987 levels.
Japanese manufacturers accounted for around 10 percent of the EEC
market for cars and trucks, he said.
   The CLCA represents national associations of vehicle makers in
Spain, Italy, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and West
Germany, the seven EEC countries that have vehicle manufacturing
plants.
   Rampa said profitability of EEC manufacturers was
``satisfactory'' in 1988 and all major European manufacturers likely
would make a profit.
   But he said debts of some automakers remained high and all
manufacturers would have to continue investing ``heavily'' in order
to improve international competitiveness.

<HEAD>Diamond Star Workers Vote to Join UAW</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORMAL, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just three months after the first cars rolled
off the line at the new Diamond-Star Motors Corp. plant, assembly
line workers have voted to join the United Auto Workers union.
   Diamond-Star spokesman Robin Skiles said today the automobile
manufacturer was officially recognizing the UAW as the bargaining
agent for plant workers.
   ``The UAW will represent some of our workers,'' Ms. Skiles said.
``The authorization cards were certified yesterday.''
   Diamond-Star is a joint venture of Chrysler Motors Corp. and
Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, and its management team is a
Japanese-American mix. Employees have received extensive training in
Japanese manufacturing methods and philosophies which stress a team
concept and company loyalty.
   ``As we have said all along, the question of unionization was to
be determined by our employees,'' Katsuhiko Kawasoe, Diamond-Star
executive vice president, said in prepared remarks.
   ``We are confident that the harmonious environment present here
at Diamond-Star will not change and labor cooperation will
continue,'' Kawasoe said.
   The American Arbitration Association certified that a majority of
Diamond-Star's 872 factory workers had signed cards authorizing UAW
representation.
   ``We are delighted to welcome the DSM production and maintenance
associates into the UAW,'' said a statement from the union president
Owen Bieber and other officials at the UAW's Detroit headquarters.
   ``Now, they have made their decision and we agree to recognize
the UAW as their exclusive bargaining representative.''
   The UAW officials praised Diamond-Star officials for ``their
sensitivity to American institutions and traditions _ in short,
their respect for the `American way of doing things.'''
   The 33 security guards at the plant voted to join the United
Plant Workers of America union.
   The $650 million plant began production of a new two-door sports
coupe in September. The vehicles, which are front-wheel drive, will
be marketed as the Plymouth Laser and the Mitsubishi Eclipse.
   Next summer, Diamond-Star will begin making a four-wheel drive
model of the Laser for the Eagle division of Chrysler to be called
the Talon.
   The 2 million-square-foot plant is a state-of-the-art factory,
which features 470 robots.
   The plant is projected to employ 2,900 people and produce 240,000
a year when it reaches full production capacity next fall.

<HEAD>Bush Economic Adviser Called for Cuts in Benefit Programs</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on general news wires.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Boskin, the conservative economist who
will be the chief economic adviser to the Bush administration, is a
longtime proponent of far-reaching changes in Social Security and
other benefit programs that Boskin labels ``welfare for the
wealthy.''
   In a book last year, Boskin wrote that President Reagan's
successor can control spending ``only by a major attack on
middle-class entitlements.e for the wealthy simply can no longer be afforded,''
Boskin wrote in ``Reagan ''
   ``Welfarand the Economy: The Successes, Failures
and Unfinished Agenda.''
   ``More cost-conscious ... spending on these programs will
preserve benefits for the needy,'' argued Boskin, named by
President-elect George Bush on Tuesday as chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers.
   The 43-year-old Stanford University economics professor is
certain to be questioned closely about his views on the politically
sensitive subject of Social Security during his confirmation
hearings before the Senate Banking Committee.
   Boskin, in his book, cited Social Security, the Medicare program
that pays the medical bills of the elderly and farm subsidies as
prime targets for cuts.
   ``These programs are hard to curtail precisely beending curbs, without
any higher taxes.
   Critics have derisively referred to the proposal as a ``flexible
fraud,'' but Bush has been insistent that he will not raise taxes to
curb the deficit.
   Under the flexible freeze plan, overall government spending would
be allowed to grow only at the rate of inflation. Some programs
would face sharper cuts to provide money to allow others to grow at
a faster pace.
   In his book last year and in a 1986 book, ``Too Many Promises,''
Boskin offered far different advice about Social Security, urging a
sharp curtailment in real growth of future benefits, especially for
higher income retirees.
   While Boskin has been a prominent critic of the existing Social
Security program for more than a decade, he parts company with
conservatives who favor turning the system over to private auspices.
   Instead, Boskin has proposed creating a two-tiered pension system
and additional incentives for more private savings for retirement.
   In the first tier, everyone would receive monthly checks at
retirement based on a dollar-for-dollar return on their Social
Security payroll taxes and the taxes paid by their employers. The
benefit formula, which now provides a proportionally bigger return
for low-income workers, would be the same for all.
   There would be no spouse's benefit, but husbands and wives would
share earnings credits equally.
   The second tier would be a welfare program for the elderly poor,
financed from general revenues instead of the payroll tax.
   Boskin credits Social Security as a ``major contributor to the
relief of economic distress and hardship among the elderly'' but he
criticized the program for ``channeling funds to those who could by
no means be considered needy, paid out of taxes partially levied on
low- and middle-income people.''
   In his review of Reagan's record on the economy, Boskin called
the string of huge budget deficits the ``major flaw in the Reagan
program.''
   He wrote that the next administration will need to control
spending by tackling not only Social Security, but also Medicare
benefits for higher-income people, farm subsidies and government
loans to students and others.
   While Bush has vowed to leave Social Security untouched, his
choice as budget director, Richard Darman, already has indicated
that the new administration will be looking for budget savings in
Medicare.
   Without changes, Medicare is projected to cost the federal
government $97.7 billion in fiscal 1990, which begins next October.
That is a 14.5 percent increase from the current fiscal year,
reflecting growth that is almost four times faster than the expected
inflation rate.

<HEAD>London Shares Up 4.3 Points</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with closing prices</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices were higher at Wednesday's close after
a late rally inspired by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's proposal
for a unilateral cut in Soviet conventional forces.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 4.3
points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,771.7 at the close, above the low of
1.9 points off, but well below the session peak of 10.5 points up.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed 6.2 points higher at
1,451.0.
   Volume was a moderate 490.1 million shares, up from 466.4 million
shares a day earlier.
   After opening higher on previous gains in New York and Tokyo, the
London market drifted downward for most of the trading session as
the stronger prices were not supported by sufficient buying activity.
   But the London market rallied again off its lows at late
afternoon, lifted by the news that Gorbachev proposed a substantial
cut in Soviet conventional armed forces.
   Gorbachev's proposals triggered a rise in the dollar but only a
slight advance on Wall Street, as players focused on the
implications for the U.S. budget deficit.
   The new Bush administration should find it easier to cut defense
spending and so deal with the deficit problem, some analysts
speculated.

   Ministers from the United States and Europe raced
toward a deadline in trade talks Wednesday, as delegates from the
Third World appealed to them for statesmanship to break a deadlock
over farm supports.
   The United States and the 12-nation European Ecoomic Community
have been deadlocked for the past four days of ministerial trade
talks and mediation efforts thus far have failed to break the logjam.
   Ricardo Zerbino, chairman of the Uruguay Round of trade talks,
held informal contacts with the two sides and drafted proposal
papers. He also convened delegation heads from more than 90
countries late Tuesday and expressed his concern about the lack of
progress in the talks.
   The EEC-U.S. dispute revolves around a demand by the United
States that all 96 member states of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade eliminate their subsidies for farmers.
   The EEC, with a much larger rural population and strong farm
lobbies, is only willing to reduce the subsidies but not to cancel
them.
   Adopting a proven tactic to generate progress on their last
scheduled day of talks, both sides announced their delegation heads
would leave Montreal by midday Thursday.
   ``It always works. They sit up all night and get an agreement,''
said one veteran observer of international negotiations.
   Canadian Minister of International Trade John Crosbie told
reporters late Tuesday that after four days of talks ``no one has
yet blinked, but I'm hoping to see an eyelid quiver before too many
more hours go by.''
   But Australian Trade Minister Michael Duffy said he was not
hopeful of progress before the end of the mid-term review of the
Uruguay Round of trade talks. The four-year round, begun in 1986 in
Punta del Este, Uruguay, is designed to update the 40-year-old
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The mid-term review brings together ministers from some 100
nations who are seeking to emerge from their talks with instructions
to their negotiators for the final two years of the round.
   The stalemate over the farm issue was holding up progress in
other ministerial groups negotiating over the inclusion of services
and copyrights in the GATT agreement, which regulates international
trade.
   GATT spokesman David Woods said some headway was made in those
groups, but it would not be reflected in any final Montreal
statement because of the ``linkages'' made by delegates to settling
the agricultural issue.
   Jose Concepcion, head of the Philippines delegation, said ``it is
a sad thing for the world when two powers put developing countries
at a standstill'' because of their fight.
   ``We have appealed to them to exercise statemanship that will
give substance to the act of faith that launched this round in Punta
del Este'' Uruguay two years ago.
   The agricultural subsidies, while of relatively minor value in
dollar terms in the international market, are a volatile political
issue.
   For the United States, elimination of price supports would ease
the drain on the federal budget. The government has poured as much
as $27 million annually into subsidies every year.
   For the Europeans, elimination of price supports would endanger
the EEC's common agricultural policy and incur the wrath of powerful
farm lobbies.
   ``Our common agricultural policy has to ensure a living for
family-owned farms,'' said chief EEC negotiator Willy de Clercq. He
said the EEC has some 11 million farmers compared with 2.5 million
in the United States.
   The Montreal talks are designed to review progress made so far in
the round and to provide negotiators with instructions for the final
two years of talks.
   Developing nations such as the Philippines, Brazil and India were
apprehensive that the agenda for the Uruguay Round would be dictated
by the interests of developed countries and would fail to take their
concerns into account.
   They nonetheless agreed to join the round, but significant gaps
have emerged between their positions and those of the industrialized
world in the past two years of negotiations in Geneva.
   The EEC on Wednesday championed the cause of the developing
nations, saying a U.S.-backed proposal put forth in a group
discussing trade in services failed to address the Third World's
concerns.
   Community officials said the proposal, designed to regulate trade
in such things as transportation and services, also does not take
into account the EEC's demand for reciprocal access to GATT members'
markets.

<HEAD>Government Fines Airlines $1.6 Million for Security Lapses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration fined 29
airlines more than $1.6 million Wednesday for security lapses at
passenger checkpoints, although officials said the violations have
declined significantly in the past year.
   The civil penalties ranged from $1,000 against a handful of
commuter carriers _ the minimum for a single violation _ to more
than $200,000 apiece against American Airlines, Northwest Airlines
and United Airlines for each having more than two dozen violations.
   The penalties stemmed from failures by security guards at airport
checkpoints to detect 236 mock weapons carried or hidden in carry-on
baggage by undercover FAA officials. Most of the violations occurred
between April and September of this year.
   The agency collected more than $1 million in fines earlier this
year as a result of violations that occurred in late l987 and early
l988 as part of a stepped up effort by the government to improve
checkpoint security at major airports.
   Despite the latest civil penalties, Transportation Department
officials said the airlines, which are responsible for passenger
screening at airports, have significantly improved their detection
of weapons at screening points since the matter became a focus of
concern in late l987.
   According to FAA figures, the airlines in l987 detected 78.9
percent of the mock weapons being passed through checkpoints by FAA
undercover agents. During the first six months of this year the
success rate increased to 85.6 percent and during the July-September
period it improved to 88.9 percent.
   But Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley told reporters while
announcing the latest figures that he is not satisfied with a
failure rate in excess of 11 percent.
   ``The FAA will continue to test the airport security network to
assure that it provides the protection the American public expects
and deserves,'' he said. ``Although the detection rate has improved
since last year, I will not be satisfied until we achieve a 100
percent success rate in detecting weapons.''
   The FAA said that the $1.66 million in fines against the 29
airlines reflected 236 cases in which mock weapons were undetected
at airport checkpoints, where X-ray screening devices, metal
detectors and visual checks are used to prevent the smuggling of
weapons aboard aircraft.
   In some cases a single violation resulted in several airlines
being fined because a number of air carriers shared responsibility
for a checkpoint. Fines were either $1,000 or $10,000 per violation
for each air carrier involved, according to a DOT spokesman.
   DOT spokesman Ed O'Hara said that airlines were fined $1,000 for
each violation that occurred at a checkpoint where the overall
detection rate was 95 percent or better and $10,000 at a checkpoint
where the overall rate was less than 95 percent.
   The FAA declined to provide a breakdown of the detection rates at
various airports or disclose how many airports and which were
checked.
   Four airlines were cited for at least two dozen violations:
United, 33 violations for $249,00 in fines; Northwest, 29 violations
for $209,000 in fines; American, 28 violations for $208,000 in
fines; and USAir, 26 violations for $179,000 in fines.
   Other airlines and their violations and fines were:
   Pan American World Airways, 19 and $154,000; Delta Air Lines, 17
and $116,000; Continental Airlines, 14 and $85,000; Eastern
Airlines, 11 and $65,000; Alaska Airlines, 10 and $64,000; Trans
World Airlines, 9 and $72,000; America West, 7 and $61,000;
   Piedmont Airlines, 5 and $32,000; Hawaiian Airlines, 5 and
$23,000; Midway, 4 and $31,000; Skywest, 2 and $20,000; Air Midwest,
Braniff and Great Lakes Airline, all 2 with $11,000 apiece; Aloha
Airlines, Atlantic SE Airline, Aviation Assoc. (Eastern Metro),
Resort Air (Trans World Expess), and Wings West, all 1 violation and
$10,000 apiece; MarkAir, Pacific Southwest (since merged with
USAir), Reeve Aleutian, Simmons (American Eagle), Tennessee Airways
and Tower Air, each 1 violation and $1,000.

<HEAD>Minkow Unlikable but Innocent, Defense Attorney Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A defense attorney implored jurors today not
to convict former teen carpet-cleaning tycoon Barry Minkow on stock
fraud charges merely because they dislike him.
   ``The presumption of innocence doesn't apply only to defendants
who are likable,'' said defense attorney David Kenner as Minkow sat
watching him from the counsel table.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, you may well not like Barry Minkow,'' he
told jurors in the defense's closing arguments.
   ``You may think Barry Minkow is a cad ... emotionally immature.
You certainly wouldn't want Barry Minkow to go out with your
daughter,'' he said.
   ``But none of those things removes from him the presumption of
innocence,'' said Kenner.
   The attorney then began a point-by-point answer to the
government's allegations that Minkow swindled big investors and
small ones out of millions of dollars with his ZZZZ Best
carpet-cleaning company. Kenner admitted there is no question that
Minkow defrauded investors, but he claimed the young man was the
victim of mobsters who manipulated his every move.
   On Tuesday, a prosecutor delivered a stinging closing argument in
which he denounced Minkow as a ``pathological liar'' who was
compelled by greed rather than mob threats when he bilked investors
in his ZZZZ Best empire.
   ``He knows how to get sympathy, and with all that guile and
deceit he stole more than a thousand gang members could with his one
little briefcase,'' assistant U.S. Attorney Gordon Greenberg said
Tuesday.
   Greenberg was the first lawyer to offer final arguments in the
four-month-old securities fraud trial.
   After Kenner's arguments and a prosecution rebuttal today, the
case was to be submitted to jurors.
   Minkow, whose company became a hot Wall Street item before it
collapsed in scandal, has said he was a naive youth manipulated by
mobsters who beat him and made death threats to get their way.
   Minkow, who launched his business at 16 in his parents' garage,
became familiar to millions of Californians through his television
ads.
   He is charged with 57 counts of securities, credit card and mail
fraud in a swindle that cost investors millions. Major banks and
securities firms lost money along with individual investors.

<HEAD>Sears Offers More Credit to Boost Holiday Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. said Wednesday it had
extended billions of dollars in additional credit to 10 million
Sears charge-card holders in hopes of boosting sales for the holiday
season and the coming year.
   Sears notified about 40 percent of its cardholders of their
higher credit limits in letters mailed out during the past month,
said Philo Holland, a spokesman for the Sears Merchandise Group.
   The cardholders were selected for both their creditworthiness and
the likelihood that they would use the extra credit, Holland said.
   Sears also lengthened the repayment period for those accounts to
36 months from 30 months, thereby reducing minimum monthly payments
by at least 20 percent.
   Holland acknowledged that the credit extension ``certainly does
have an effect in terms of the holiday season.''
   But he called it ``an ongoing program to provide greater
purchasing power to our customers, not only through the Christmas
season but throughout the year.''
   The company had $13 billion in loans outstanding to its store
card holders, or an average of about $515 an account, at the end of
1987. Holland would not disclose the exact amount of additional
credit that Sears had made available or the average credit line
prior to the extensions.
   The company said it was optimistic about the Christmas season,
which retail industry analysts are predicting will be moderately
strong.
   ``If you look at the rest of the industry, we're doing pretty
well,'' Sears Chairman Edward A. Brennan said in an interview on
Tuesday. ``Customers seem in a mood to buy.''
   The company has attempted to spur holiday sales with heavily
advertised sale prices, including steep discounts on home appliances.
   Sears, which also is a major player in the financial-services
arena, recently announced a major restructuring of its retail
business that will include a switch to ``everyday low pricing'' at
all of its 825 stores. It currently uses a policy of regular prices
with frequent sales on specific items.
   Holland said the extra-credit program was not designed
specifically to reduce Sears' inventory in preparation for the
pricing switch, which begins next spring. The company plans to cut
the number of items it offers in some lines.
   ``This is a program that was considered well before that,'' he
said, referring to the decision to restructure the merchandise group.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Denies Injunction in Takeover Bid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge refused Wednesday to
intervene in Torchmark Corp.'s hostile takeover battle for Kansas
City Life Insurance Co. by rejecting a request for a preliminary
injunction.
   The decision was seen as a major setback for Torchmark although a
company lawyer said the Birmingham, Ala., firm would pursue its
offer to Kansas City Life's stockholders of $47.50 a share, or
approximately $347 million.
   U.S. District Judge Scott O. Wright refused Torchmark's request
to block Kansas City Life and its principal owners from buying more
of the company's stock; to force Kansas City Life to provide
confidential information about the comany, and to require Kansas
City Life to hire new financial advisers and set up a special
committee of directors to review the $47.50 offer.
   ``Despite the decision of the court today, Torchmark believes
that the interest of all involved in our effort to acquire the
Kansas City Life Insurance Co. would be best served through direct
negotiations between our company and the leadership of Kansas City
Life,'' Torchmark President Jon Rotenstreich said in a statement
Wednesday.
   The court ruling means Kansas City Life and its principal owners,
the families of J.R. Bixby and W.E. Bixby, are free to buy more
shares of Kansas City Life's common stock. The Bixby families
control 48.8 percent of the company's stock and could gain a
majority of the stock by buying several thousand shares. The Bixbys
have not publicized their plans.
   Torchmark had asked the court to prevent the company and the
Bixbys from buying any stock to maintain a ``level playing field''
while Torchmark tries to gain control interest in the company.
Torchmark is barred from buying stock on the market until its tender
offer to all stockholders expires next Wednesday.
   Kansas City Life directors met today to consider the $47.50
offer, but Fred Spar, a public relations spokesman in New York, said
he was not sure when a decision would be reached.
   Torchmark sued Kansas City Life on Nov. 16, the same day it
offered $43.50 a share for all of Kansas City Life's stock. Kansas
City Life's directors recommended stockholders reject that offer,
but Torchmark countered with the $47.50 bid.

<HEAD>Yeutter and DeClerq: Lions In Winter</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhotos</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The European is white-haired, tall, full of joie
de vivre. The American is intense _ people say his name rhymes with
fighter. Willy de Clercq and Clayton Yeutter are facing off this
week for the last time on the international stage.
   This week's brawl over farm subsidies at the GATT free-trade
talks here is in the grand tradition of the two men who have battled
each other with relish for four years.
   Although both men will leave office early next year, neither is
coming across in Montreal as a lame duck. Lions in winter would be a
better description.
   When it is all over, though, the two may actually miss each other.
   ``De Clercq sees this with a bit of nostalgia. They have had some
good fights with each other,'' said his spokeswoman, Francoise Le
Bail-Elles.
   Yeutter, 57, the U.S. trade representative, is the kind of person
who went from high school through a doctorate without ever getting
less than an `A.'
   He studied for his doctorate in agricultural economics and his
law degree simultaneously while also managing a 2,500-acre farm in
Cozad, Neb., and ranked first in both programs.
   Yeutter is proudly a free-marketeer: In his last job before
becoming trade representative in July 1985, he was president and
chief executive of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's
second largest futures market.
   It was announced early on here that Yeutter had asked to have a
typewriter delivered to his hotel room _ apparently so he could keep
working after everyone else had gone to bed.
   In contrast to the super-achieving Yeutter, the 61-year-old de
Clercq is a gregarious politician whose negotiating instincts grow
out of his 30 years in the fractious world of Belgian politics.
   De Clercq is the 12-nation EEC's commissioner for external
relations and trade policy. He is also Belgium's deputy prime
minister and minister for finance and foreign trade.
   De Clercq, who enjoys bantering with reporters, said before talks
started that he hoped U.S. negotiators had come like Santa Claus
with a bag of realistic proposals.
   The un-Santa-Claus-like Yeutter, in contrast, has not spoken to
the press. When President-elect Bush announced Carla Hills as his
successor, Yeutter's praise for Mrs. Hills was delivered by a deputy.
   What the two men share is a fierce stubbornness at the bargaining
table.
   ``They're both very effective people and they're both very well
respected,'' said William Crosbie, a Canadian policy adviser at the
GATT talks.
   Neither was available Wednesday for an interview.
   Yeutter enjoys one advantage over de Clercq: Since he represents
only one government, he has more room to maneuver.
   ``De Clercq has 12 mother-in-laws. He has always to listen very
closely to what his mother-in-laws have to say,'' said Bernhard
Zepter, a deputy negotiator for West Germany.
   The last official meeting between Yeutter and de Clercq is likely
to be this Friday in Belgium, where they will attend a U.S.-EEC
ministerial meeting.
   The directions they will take from here reflect their differences.
   Yeutter, who will leave office along with President Reagan, has
held exploratory talks with several companies about high executive
posts, including the Wall Street firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   De Clercq, in contrast, is sticking to politics. He will run for
a five-year term to the European Parliament. The election is in
June, and he is almost certain to win.

<HEAD>Pepsi-Cola To Shoot TV Ad in Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev spoke of
improving chances for peace and lobbied for better trade relations
with the West, Pepsi-Cola Co. announced plans Wednesday to shoot its
first television commercial in Russia.
   The Somers, N.Y.-based soft drink maker said it planned to film
the entire commercial with an all-Soviet cast starting next week in
and around Moscow. The film crew will be a mix of Americans and
Soviets.
   The announcement came as Gorbachev addressed the United Nations,
met with President Reagan and President-elect George Bush and toured
New York.
   The ad, which will employ about 20 Soviet actors and actresses
speaking Russian, is intended to show the shared interests of Soviet
and American teenagers.
   Tod MacKenzie, spokesman for Pepsi-Cola, said it will be clearly
evident from the locations selected for the ad that it was shot in
Russia.
   MacKenzie declined to disclose when the company planned to
broadcast the commercial, but he said it could be used on Soviet
television or carry subtitles in English or other languages for use
in the United States or any other country where Pepsi-Cola products
are sold.
   MacKenzie also declined to disclose which Pepsi-Cola products
would be featured in the ad.
   MacKenzie said he knew of only one other American product _
Dannon yogurt _that had been advertised in a commercial shot
entirely inside the Soviet Union. The commercial, which featured
some long-living Soviets who loved yogurt, was aired in the early
1970s.
   Pepsi-Cola is no stranger to the Soviet Union. Its soft drinks
have been marketed there since 1974, and earlier this year the
company was one of the first Western concerns to buy time for ads on
Soviet television.
   The commercial will be directed by Leslie Dektor, who is known
for using a shakily moving camera and grainy film footage in ads for
clients such as Levi's 501 jeans and American Telephone & Telegraph
Co.
   The work will be overseen by Pepsi-Cola's ad agency, BBDO Inc. of
New York.

   The Transportation Department released
statistical reports Wednesday on the performance of major airlines
in the United States.
   The reports, some covering only the largest carriers and others
including smaller ones, involve such areas as on-time performance,
chronically late flights, baggage problems, bumping, and consumer
complaints.
   The reports covering on-time performance, chronically late
flights, and lost baggage reflect flights in October. The bumping
statistics cover the 3rd Quarter (July-September)
   Consumer complaints received by the department reflect complaints
in November.

   Complaints of lost and mishandled baggage received by airlines in
October, shown as the number of complaints per 1,000 passengers on
the airline.
   Department officials cautioned that these figures may not be
comparable from airline to airline because of differing methods of
reporting. For example, some airlines count in their complaint data
courtesy tracers, in which they seek to help people from other
airlines find lost baggage. In addition, reporting methods vary for
problems with carry-on baggage and late-arriving passengers.

   The stock market eked out a small gain today in a
subdued response to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's speech at the
United Nations.
   The dollar rose, interest rates fell and stock prices climbed
Tuesday on anticipation of the conciliatory actions that Gorbachev
announced in his speech today, including reductions in military
forces.
   That presumably opens the way for the United States to cut its
defense spending as well, reducing inflationary pressures and
narrowing the government's budget deficit.
   But as often happens, analysts said, investors turned more
cautious today when their expectations were fulfilled.
   Some traders apparently cashed in on the market's recent gains,
following the old Wall Street precept ``buy on the rumor, sell on
the news.''

   The stock market struggled to a small gain
Wednesday in a muted response to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's
speech at the United Nations.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen 57.08
points in the two previous sessions, added another 4.27 to 2,153.63.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
817 up, 632 down and 536 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 148.36 million
shares, down from 158.34 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 180.72 million shares.
   The dollar rose, interest rates fell and stock prices climbed
Tuesday on anticipation of the conciliatory actions that Gorbachev
announced in his speech Wednesday, including reductions in military
forces.
   That presumably opens the way for the United States sooner or
later to cut its defense spending as well, reducing inflationary
pressures and narrowing the government's budget deficit.
   But as often happens in the stock market, analysts said,
investors turned more cautious when their expectations were
fulfilled.
   Some traders apparently cashed in on the market's recent gains,
following the old Wall Street precept ``buy on the rumor, sell on
the news.''
   Brokers also said concerns persisted about the interest-rate
outlook, including the possibility that the Federal Reserve might
soon raise its discount rate again in an effort to keep economic
growth at a sustainable pace.
   Nevertheless, with its recent upswing the Dow Jones industrial
average has moved with hailing distance of the 1988 closing high of
2,183.50 it reached on Oct. 21.
   Texaco made a big contribution to the Dow's gain Wednesday,
climbing 2{ to 51] in active trading. Speculation intensified on the
Street that Carl Icahn, who holds a stake in the company, might be
planning a new effort to gain control of it.
   Among other actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &
Telegraph rose \ to 29}; Sears Roebuck gained \ to 40{;
International Business Machines dropped 1[ to 121; General Electric
rose [ to 45}, and Exxon was unchanged at 44],.
   Jefferies Group rose [ to 11\ in the over-the-counter market. The
company said it and some of its employees bought a large block of
Jefferies shares from Primerica Inc.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $6.21 billion, or 0.23
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.36 to 156.14.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose .69 to 320.54, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up .54 at 278.13.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped .64 to 376.36. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 297.77, up .41.

<HEAD>Naming of Corr as Continental Chief Fits Lorenzo Strategy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The naming of D. Joseph Corr as chief executive
officer of Continental Airlines should help the carrier's
performance and it also fits into Frank Lorenzo's strategy for
maintaining the airline as a separate entity, observers said
Wednesday.
   Lorenzo, chairman of Continental's parent Texas Air Corp., named
Corr on Tuesday to replace him as chief of Continental. Lorenzo will
remain a director of the Houston-based airline, while Martin Shugrue
will remain as president.
   Corr, 47, is a former president of Trans World Airlines Inc. and
was a close associate of financier Carl Icahn, TWA's owner.
   Some airline analysts said they were not sure of the precise
significance of Lorenzo's move, but they believed it bolstered his
strategy for Continental.
   Corr brings to Continental the ability to squeeze profits out of
languishing companies, the analysts said. Continental, often an
industry leader in cutting air fares, has experienced financial
turbulence but recently started to show improvement.
   Corr is ``a good, hard-nosed manager,'' said John Pincavage, who
follows the industry for the investment firm PaineWebber Inc.
   Corr and Shugrue could complement each other well, he said, since
Corr is adept at overall company strategy while Shugrue, a former
top Pan Am Corp. executive, is ``one hell of a day-to-day operating
guy.''
   In announcing Corr's appointment, Lorenzo called him ``a superb
manager who has improved the performance of several companies.''
   As president of TWA beginning in April 1986, Corr helped lead the
carrier from potential bankruptcy back to profitability.
   He accomplished the same at ACF Industries Inc., a St.
Louis-based company controlled by Icahn, where profits increased
fourfold between 1983 and 1986.
   Julius Maldutis, airline analyst for Salomon Inc., called Corr
``a very bottom-line oriented, pragmatic businessman.''
   Pincavage said that by naming Corr as Continental chairman,
Lorenzo also could be aiming to reinforce the separation between
non-union Continental and its sister carrier Eastern Airlines. The
militant unions at Miami-based Eastern have been pushing for a
merger of the two Texas Air carriers, which could pave the way for
the unionization of Continental.
   In his announcement, Lorenzo said the selection of Corr
``emphasizes Texas Air's commitment to managing our airlines
separately.''

<HEAD>Children Rate Toys Through Play</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHEL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study that let children play with 19 toys
for five days before rating them for their ``playability'' has found
the top toy to be a video camera manufactered by Fisher Price.
   The toy company's ``PXL 2000 Camcorder'' allows children to make
video recordings and play them back. The toy finished ahead of
another Fisher Price toy known as ``Star Stage,'' which has a
microphone and stage lights for putting on a show, according to
Duracell U.S.A., a Bethel-based battery manufacturer that sponsored
the study.
   ``The survey results confirm that children will play with toys
they can learn from, but only if they don't look like school work,''
said Kendall Park, N.J.-based toy consultant Ruth Roufberg, who
conducted the study.
   Roufberg said the children preferred toys they knew how to use
without explanation. Toys that teach geography and deductive
reasoning were among the top-ranked toys, while toys that dealt with
optics experiments and fossils were among the lowest-ranked items.
   Roufberg said the two low-rated toys both contained ``school-like
booklets,'' which she speculated was a reason for their rankings.
Roufberg said her study also found that children disliked games that
involved rules or concentration.
   The six lowest-rated toys were science project kits and strategy
board games. However, the study found that the ratings of board
games increased by the final day, indicating these toys take more
time to appreciate, she said.
   The study involved more than 1,700 hours of testing by 352
children at 15 test sites across the country between Oct. 3 through
Oct. 24. The median age of participants was 7.5 years, with the
range between 5 and 9.
   Roufberg prescreened 1,000 toys for their educational merit and
play value to come up with the 19 used in the study.
   In the study, each child played with the toys for at least one
hour a day for five days. Children were then asked in one-on-one
interviews to choose their favorite toys.
   The study found that eight of the top ten toys were the same for
boys and girls.
   ``I didn't think boys and girls would show so much similarity,''
Roufberg said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
   The study didn't examine preferences based on age, but Roufberg
said that she would like to make that a part of future research.
   Combining the results for boys and girls, the top toys were: PXL
2000 Camcorder, Star Stage, Remoco's ``Footnotes,'' Hasbro's ``Body
Rap,'' Milton Bradley's ``Bed Bugs,'' Fisher Price's ``Discovery
Globe,'' Milton Bradley's ``Guess Who?,'' Fisher Price's ``Magic
Scan,'' Western Publishing's ``Shrieks & Creaks'' and Hasbro's
``Road Hogs.''
   The remaining nine, in order were: Ohio Art's ``Zaks,'' Parker
Brothers' ``Yoshi's Puzzle,'' Tedco's ``Reflecto,'' Bushnell's
``Light Fantastics,'' Playscapes' ``Sprint,'' Ravensburger's ``Up
The River,'' Educational Insights' ``Dinosaurs & Fossils,''
Pressman's ``Wordsearch,'' and Ravensburger's ``Guess My Name.''
   Eight of the toys tested require batteries, Duracell said. But
the company said its only role was to sponsor the study, not to
select the toys or have a role in designing the research.
   The toys rated top to bottom by girls were: Footnotes, Star
Stage, Camcorder, Discovery Globe, Bed Bugs, Guess Who?, Magic Scan,
Body Rap, Shrieks & Creaks, Reflecto, Yoshi's Puzzle, Zaks, Sprint,
Up The River, Light Fantastics, Road Hogs, Guess My Name, Wordsearch
and Dinosaurs & Fossils.
   The list of best toys according to the boys were: Camcorder, Body
Rap, Star Stage, Bed Bugs, Road Hogs, Guess Who?, Shrieks & Creaks,
Footnotes, Discovery Globe, Zaks, Magic Scan, Yoshi's Puzzle, Light
Fantastics, Dinosaurs & Fossils, Sprint, Reflecto, Wordsearch, Up
The River and Guess My Name.

<HEAD>British Company Buying Amalgamated Sugar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OGDEN, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bristar, a British sugar producer, has signed
a tentative agreement with Valhi Inc. to acquire its Amalgamated
Sugar subsidiary, it was announced Wednesday.
   The purchase price was undisclosed, but Dallas-based Valhi said
the sale would bring it an after-tax gain of $185 million. The sale
must be approved by the boards of directors of Bristar and Valhi.
   Bristar is the food division of S&W Berisford PLC, which also
owns British Sugar, one of Europe's leading beet sugar companies.
   Bristar has said that it intends to retain Amalgamated's current
management. The sale will not result in any noticeable changes in
the company's beet sugar operations, said Amalgamated President
Allan M. Lipman Jr.
   ``I think we'll operate on our own,'' he said.
   Amalgamated is among the U.S. leaders in beet sugar, accounting
for 9 percent of domestic sugar production. While it is based in
Ogden, Amalgamated mostly operates in Idaho and Oregon.
   Amalgamated was founded in 1897 by David Eccles as Ogden Sugar
Co. It employs 75 workers at its Ogden operations and another 1,125
full-time and 1,600 seasonal workers, mostly in southern Idaho.
   The company is finishing an anticipated record year in sales and
earnings, recording $19.1 million in profit on sales of $295.6
million through the first three quarters of 1988.
   Amalgamated has had an informal relationship with British Sugar
dating back 40 years, and Lipman has known managers of the company
for some time, he said.
   British Sugar officials approached Lipman about a possible buyout
in October, he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises, Gold Skids on Gorbachev Remarks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORk (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar surged and gold prices skidded
Wednesday after Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev announced his
country would reduce the size of its military.
   The dollar rose more than 2 pfennigs against the West German
mark, while gold dropped more than $4 a troy ounce.
   Gorbachev told the United Nations the Soviet Union would cut its
troop strength by half a million and reduce the number of its
conventional armaments.
   The dollar, which had moved higher in advance of Gorbachev's
speech, soared on foreign and domestic markets after his
announcement.
   James McGroarty, a vice president at Discount Corp. here, said
the markets decided the Soviet move would result in a cut in U.S.
defense spending and therefore help reduce the U.S. budget deficit.
   But the dollar gave up some ground after traders began to analyze
Gorbachev's statement to see how significant it really was,
McGroarty said.
   He described the dollar's initial surge as a ``knee-jerk
reaction'' to the speech.
   Overseas dealers said the dollar also fell because it had shot up
too quickly.
   ``People were just reacting blindly,'' said one dealer. ``If
anything, it's usually an escalation of hostilities that encourages
people to buy dollars, not a de-escalation, unless that would
benefit the U.S. economy.''
   Nonetheless, the dollar managed a strong advance for the day.
   In London, the dollar spurted against the British pound. It cost
$1.8425 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.8675 late Tuesday. In
later New York trading, the pound slipped to $1.8435 from late
Tuesday's $1.86025.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.75975 West German marks, up from 1.7376; 1.4795
Swiss francs, up from 1.45755; 6.0035 French francs, up from 5.9130;
1,299.00 Italian lire, up from 1,282.50; and 1.19925 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.19135.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.7588 West German marks, up from 1.7290; 1.4790
Swiss francs, up from 1.4480; 6.0025 French francs, up from 5.9015;
1.9675 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9470; 1,290.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,277.12; 1.1995 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1887.
   In Tokyo, where trading ended hours before Gorbachev's speech,
the dollar rose 0.89 Japanese yen to a closing 122.43 yen. Later, in
London, it rose further to 123.25 yen, and in New York, it rose to
123.525 yen from late Tuesday's 121.915..
   Meanwhile, gold fell as traders saw signs of peace in Gorbachev's
statement.
   ``In times of uncertainty, gold tends to firm,'' said Stephen
Platt, a metals analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Gorbachev's announcement removed the ``fear factor'' from the
market, Platt said.
   Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $422.50
for a troy ounce of gold, down from $426.75 late Tuesday. On the
Commodity Exchange in New York, gold dropped to $422.80 from $427.50
on Tuesday.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $422.95 a troy ounce,
compared with $427.25 bid late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, gold finished at a bid $423.50 compared with $427.75
bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.07 to close at a bid $426.66.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.14 a troy ounce, compared with
$6.12 bid late Tuesday. But silver skidded on the Commodity
Exchange, falling to $6.140 a troy ounce from late Tuesday's $6.161.

<HEAD>Government Control of Union Ends With Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government's first experiment in
taking over a mob-run union ended Wednesday with one of the nation's
largest Teamsters locals electing officers allied to the corrupt
regime ousted four years ago.
   ``I think it's a real disaster for the future of the labor
movement ...,'' said Clyde Summers a labor law expert at the
University of Pennsylvania.
   But other labor observers said the very existence of a
legitimately contested election at Local 560 justified the interim
rule by a court-appointed trustee that preceded the vote.
   ``Newcomers represent the revitalization of the political process
in this local,'' said Linda Kaboolian, a fellow at Harvard
University's Kennedy School of Government who has researched the
Local 560 trusteeship for a year.
   ``That they didn't win isn't the final word on the future of
Local 560,'' she said.
   The election also could affect the Justice Department's suit
against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which seeks to
oust the parent union's board and establish a trustee to keep out
corruption and establish elections.
   ``Certainly it's a good example of a potential backlash against a
trusteeship,'' said Goldberg.
   The Teamsters for Liberty ticket, which includes two relatives of
ousted officers of Local 560, captured 65 percent of 4,530 ballots
counted Tuesday and early Wednesday in balloting that brought an
unusually high turnout among the local's 7,600 members.
   Teamsters for Liberty opposed the court-appointed trusteeship,
which was imposed in 1986 after U.S. District Judge Harold A.
Ackerman found in a Justice Department lawsuit that organized crime
had ruled the Union City-based local for more than a quarter-century.
   He ordered removal of the local's executive board.
   Ballots were mailed on November in the local's first contested
election in 23 years.
   Danny Sciarra and Mark Sheridan led the winning slate to become
the new president and vice president.
   They are relatives of former officers Michael Sciarra and Joseph
Sheridan, who this fall were barred from running because of ties to
the old leaders. The new officers have said they will rely on and
consult with their kin in running the union.
   The trustee, Edwin H. Stier, a former prosecutor, will monitor
the local for at least three months, after which the new
seven-member board must report to Ackerman on its activities. The
judge also kept indefinite jurisdiction over the board.
   Attorney Harvey Weissbard, who represented Michael Sciarra and
Joseph Sheridan, said the vote's results were a clear vindication of
his clients and a rejection of the trusteeship.
   ``I think clearly the vast majority of the members ... really did
not appreciate having the trusteeship thrust upon them,'' he said.
``I just think that the whole concept is ill-conceived.''
   Summers said the local's history of violence and intimidation at
the hands of the Genovese organize crime family might have helped
bring about the result.
   The opposition, an independant rank-and-file group that arose
during the trusteeship, had little chance to gain support if members
saw ``no guarantee of one's life, limb and future work'' following
the old leadership's victory, Summers said.
   Michael Goldberg, a visiting labor law professor at the
University of Washington in Seattle, said the race might have been
closer if the shop stewards, many of whom were beholden to the old
regime, had been replaced.
   ``It just demonstrates how difficult it is for any remedy to
succeed when you have 30 years of entrenched and autocratic
leadership,'' Goldberg said.
   Arthur L. Fox, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who represents
dissident Teamsters, said Michael Sciarra and Joseph Sheridan were
well-known and liked and considered experienced by the membership.
Their visibility coupled with better organized and financed
Teamsters for Liberty probably contributed to the ticket's victory,
he said.

   The Supreme Court spared the coal mining
industry from paying potentially billions of dollars in black-lung
benefits, but it ruled that some miners who worked less than 10
years may seek disability pay.
   The 9-0 decision Tuesday shields coal mine operators from paying
as much as $13.6 billion to a group of miners estimated to number up
to 155,000.
   At the same time, the court ruled, 5-4, that from 8,000 to 10,000
miners with pending claims are eligible to seek hundreds of millions
of dollars in benefits. That smaller group of miners consists of
workers with less than 10 years of work in the mines who say they
have been disabled by black lung disease, a respiratory ailment
caused by prolonged inhaling of coal dust.

   Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. and one of its
executives were given maximum fines by a federal judge in Manhattan
Wednesday for violating a 1951 anti-trust agreement.
   U.S. District Judge Edmund L. Palmieri fined the film company
$500,000 and handed another $5,000 penalty to the manager of a Fox
regional office for illegally restricting the distribution of films
in the Midwest _ in violation of the 37-year-old agreement with the
government.
   Previously, Palmieri found the company and Leila J. Goldstein,
manager of Fox's Indianapolis-Milwaukee-Minneapolis office, had
engaged in block booking, the practice of pressuring theater owners
to show less lucrative films in return for exhibition rights to box
office hits.
   Palmieri made that finding following a bench trial last month at
which testimony showed Ms. Goldstein directed Fox employees to book
blockbuster hits only at theaters where Fox's less desirable _ and
less profitable _ films were scheduled to play first.
   The judge ruled that Fox ``flagrantly and repeatedly'' violated
the consent agreement which provided that Fox would not enter into
any license ``in which the right to exhibit one feature is
conditioned upon the licensee's taking one or more other features.''
   The films involved in the block booking allegations included
``Prizzi's Honor,'' ``Cocoon'' and ``Black Widow.''
   The 1951 agreement settled protracted court action in which the
Justice Department accused Fox and seven other major companies of
illegal practices.

   College endowments, buffeted by the October
1987 stock market crash, still managed to post a tiny gain in the
last fiscal year, a college business group reported Wednesday.
   The National Association of College and University Business
Officers said preliminary results from its survey of 100 major
endowment funds indicated an average gain of 0.2 percent for the
year ended last June 1.
   That was down from a 13.8 percent gain for the campus endowments
in fiscal 1987, the group said. It beat the minus-7.1 percent return
on the Standard & Poor's 500 during the year. Government and
corporate bonds rose 7.5 percent during the same year.
   The business officers have tracked major campus endowments
annually since 1971.
   Caspa L. Harris, executive vice president of the association,
said, ``To the extent that one can point to a single reason for the
sharp decline in endowment returns, the October `crash' is
responsible.''
   Endowment funds ``are invested primarily in publicly traded
securities, and history suggests that the market values of such
securities fluctuate widely based on changes in investor
psychology,'' he said.
   The preliminary report did not list the endowments by name or
size. The final report will be out in February.
   Almost half the funds in the typical endowment were invested in
stocks and 29 percent in fixed income securities. Thirteen percent
was in cash and cash equivalents. The rest was invested in a variety
of ways, including 1.2 percent put up for venture capital projects.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Falter On Gorbachev Remarks</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Retransmitting</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's announcement of a unilateral
reduction of armed forces in Eastern Europe sent gold futures prices
down about $5 a troy ounce Wednesday on New York's Commodity
Exchange, analysts said.
   Futures prices of other precious metals also declined while
copper futures leaped on renewed concerns about tight supplies.
   On other markets, energy futures were mostly higher; grains and
soybeans were mixed; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and
stock-index futures advanced.
   Many investors consider gold and other precious metals relatively
secure investments in times of political unrest and economic
distress.
   Gorbachev's visit to New York was perceived as a signal that
superpower tensions were easing, prompting many speculators to
unload gold futures contracts, analysts said.
   ``It's almost as if good news for everybody else is bad news for
gold,'' said James Steel, a metals analyst with Refco Inc. in New
York.
   Gorbachev's announcement of planned military cuts in a speech to
the United Nations General Assembly also contributed to the sell-off
in the precious-metals markets on ideas that a reduction in Soviet
military spending ``could lead the United States to finding a
convenient avenue to reducing its budget deficit through cutbacks on
the military side,'' said Fred Demler, metals economist with Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   Steel said a meeting scheduled for Thursday among finance
ministers from the seven largest Western nations, including the
United States, is expected to produce an agreement to support the
dollar, a notion that spurred further selling of gold futures.
   Gold settled $4.70 to $5.40 lower with the contract for delivery
in February at $427.70 a troy ounce; silver was 2.1 cents to 3.4
cents lower with March at $6.28 a troy ounce.
   Copper futures prices soared on the Commodity Exchange following
reports of an explosion at one of the world's largest copper mines,
in Bouganville, Papua New Guinea. The incident refocused attention
on the extremely tight global supply situation, analysts said.
   ``When you get a sharp, clear news story that everyone can
understand, it kind of crystalizes everybody's simmering concerns,''
said Steel.
   Copper settled 1.80 cents to 6 cents higher with the active March
contract at $1.373 a pound and the spot December contract at $1.5725
a pound.
   Most energy futures prices headed higher in moderate trading on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, reflecting concern about crude-oil
supplies, analysts said.
   The rally was linked to lower-than-expected weekly crude supply
figures released late Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 28 cents to 33 cents
higher with January at $15.74 a barrel; heating oil was .29 cent to
.52 cent higher with February at 48.21 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .59 cent lower to .41 cent higher with January at 43.76
cents a gallon.
   Wheat futures prices rose on the Chicago Board of Trade, partly
in reaction to Gorbachev's remarks at the United Nations and partly
on expectations, which were later confirmed, that a large export
offer was in the works.
   Other grain and soybean futures finished mostly lower.
   Gorbachev's remarks stirred speculation that the Soviet Union
would use money saved through reduced defense spending to buy more
U.S. grain, said John Frazier, a grain-market specialist with
Balfour Maclaine Corp. in Chicago.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department announced that it had
targeted China for 1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices and that 100,000 metric tons of subsidized wheat had been
sold to Morocco.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 3 cents higher with December at $4.23
a bushel; corn was 2} cents lower to \ cent higher with December at

<HEAD>Texaco Stock Surges on Icahn Speculation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shares of Texaco Inc. surged in active trading
Wednesday, boosted by intensifying speculation that financier Carl
Icahn might be planning a new effort to gain control of the oil
giant.
   The speculation catapulted Texaco 2{ to 51] on the New York Stock
Exchange, its third consecutive rise. The jump made a major
contribution to Wednesday's 4.27 point gain in the Dow Jones average
of 30 industrials, which closed at 2,153.63.
   Icahn, the owner and chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., holds
a 14.8 percent stake in Texaco. Last June, he lost a proxy fight to
oust the oil company's top management.
   USA Today financial columnist Dan Dorfman reported Monday that an
unidentified party recently approached Icahn about selling his
Texaco stake. Dorfman also said he picked up ``solid reports'' that
another party _ possibly the one that approached Icahn _ has been
quietly accumulating Texaco shares.
   The speculation mounted when the New York Times suggested in
Tuesday's editions that Icahn is in talks with another party to
launch a new takeover battle for Texaco.
   The Times story quoted unidentified oil industry ``experts'' as
saying the deal under discussion would eventually give Icahn the
opportunity to sell his Texaco stake. The other partner reportedly
would build up a separate block close to 8 percent or 9 percent of
the company's outstanding shares.
   Icahn did not return a call from The Associated Press seeking
comment Wednesday.
   He told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that he has no
current intention to sell his Texaco shares and continues to believe
the company's stock is undervalued. He also indicated that he may
purchase additional Texaco stock from time to time, based on market
conditions.
   A trader with Bear, Stearns & Co. told the Dow Jones report
Wednesday that his brokerage firm has been buying Texaco shares, and
he named Salomon Brothers Inc. as another buyer.

<HEAD>GM Recalling Some Models For Faulty Seat Belt Buckles, Parking
Brakes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is recalling about 85,000
1988 Pontiac LeMans cars and about 4,000 1988 Oldsmobile Cutlass
Supreme and Pontiac Grand Prix models for faulty safety belt buckles
and parking brake cables.
   The automaker said Wednesday it is unaware of any accidents or
injuries caused by the defects, which have surfaced on some models
equipped with manual transmissions.
   On the LeMans vehicles, seat belt buckles may appear to be
latched when they are not, GM said.
   On some Cutlass Supreme and Grand Prix cars, the parking brake
may not work because the cable is improperly connected.
   Dealers will make inspections and repairs free of charge to car
owners, the automaker said.

<HEAD>MAI Basic Presses Bid for Prime Computer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NATICK, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MAI Basic Four Inc. pressed its hostile bid
for Prime Computer Inc. on Wednesday, extending the deadline on its
$970 million tender offer for Prime stock and alleging that Prime's
board of directors has misled federal regulators and the public
about its takeover defenses.
   MAI Basic, controlled by New York investor Bennett S. LeBow, said
its offer to buy all of Prime's outstanding common stock for $20 a
share would remain in force until Dec. 21. The offer, made Nov. 15,
had been scheduled to expire Dec. 13.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday, Prime closed at
$17.50 a share, down 12.5 cents. MAI Basic was unchanged at $9.
   MAI Basic, a computer company based in Tustin, Calif., said the
extension of its tender offer was intended to give a Delaware
Chancery Court time to rule on a lawsuit challenging Prime's
takeover defenses, including shareholder rights and employee
protection plans. A hearing on the suit is scheduled for Dec. 9.
   MAI Basic also moved to amend the suit by adding several
allegations against Prime and its chairman, David J. Dunn.
   The amended complaint alleges that Prime instituted its takeover
defenses after LeBow met privately on Sept. 19 with Prime's former
chief executive officer, Joe M. Henson, to discuss the possibility
of a takeover. MAI Basic alleges that the defenses served no
legitimate business purpose and were designed solely to impose a
crippling cost on any hostile buyer.
   The complaint also alleges that Dunn and his investment
partnership, Idanta Partners, bought 60,000 shares of Prime stock
after LeBow met with Henson but before the takeover bid was
announced publicly.
   Prime, based in Natick, reported earnings of $33.4 million, or 69
cents a share, on revenue of $1.16 billion for the first three
quarters of this year. MAI Basic reported earnings of $18.7 million,
or $1.25 a share, on revenue of $302.9 million.

<HEAD>Stock Broker Files Court Challenge Against SEC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Denver broker in penny stocks has filed suit in
the U.S. Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the
enforcement powers of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The broker, Blinder, Robinson and Co. Inc., is asking the court
to decide whether the agency's enforcement powers violate the
Constitution.
   The SEC issued an injunction in 1982 against the company which
alleged that Blinder, Robinson violated securities laws by
underwriting stock in American Leisure Corp., a casino based in New
Jersey.
   Blinder, Robinson said in the suit filed late last month that the
Securities and Exchange Commission has extremely broad powers, and
alleged that the agency has overstepped its bounds. The company is
asking the Supreme Court to clarify which branch of government _ the
executive, judicial or legislative _ has responsibility for the
commission.
   ``There is no limit on whom the SEC may investigate and
prosecute,'' the company said in its court complaint.
   The firm alleges that this violates the separation of powers
provided in the Constitution.
   The company also complained in its brief that there have been no
allegations of misconduct or violations since the court order was
first issued, but the injunction is continuing to harm the company's
operations.
   Blinder, Robinson has been the target of a number of federal
investigations. Recently, federal agents raided the company's
offices as part of an investigation into international stock fraud.
   The company also faces a possible fine from the National
Association of Securities Dealers in a separate, unrelated case.

   The U.S. dollar surged against the Japanese yen
Thursday, while share prices retreated on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The Nikkei stock average of 225 issues, which surpassed the
30,000-point level by closing 381.44 points higher Wednesday, lost
178.26 points, or 0.59 percent, sinking back to 29,872.56.
   The dollar, which opened at 123.40 yen, was changing hands at the
same rate in late morning, up 0.97 yen from Wednesday's close of
122.43 yen.
   After opening higher following overnight gains in New York and
London, the dollar fluctuated between 122.95 yen and 123.48 yen,
trading above the 123.00-yen level for the first time since Nov. 16,
when it opened at 123.58 yen.
   There was little movement after the currency market opened, said
Minori Takeuchi of Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   ``Although the dollar in New York rose sharply following news of
a possible Soviet arms reduction in Europe, players in Tokyo don't
believe the dollar's uptrend will continue much longer,'' she said.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, in an address Wednesday to the
United Nations, pledged a unilateral reduction of Soviet troops and
a cutback in conventional arms.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei average slid back mainly
because of profit-taking and the higher dollar, said an analyst with
Nomura Securities.
   He said many traders, who bought cheaper stocks in spot trading
and sold issues in futures trading to collect profits from the
difference, were mainly selling in spot trading Thursday, pushing
prices lower.
