<TEXT>
   Actress Robin Givens, who last week hired
celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson to oversee the breakup
of her marriage to heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, changed
lawyers on Monday.
   The new attorney, Raoul Felder of New York City, said he would
like to negotiate a settlement.
   Felder said Miss Givens loves the millionaire prizefighter, whom
she accused of beating her and threatening to kill her, but said
there appears no chance to save the eight-month marriage.
   Felder said the case filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court
would be handled by one of his West Coast associates rather than by
Mitchelson.
   ``I don't like to say `fired,'' Felder said in a telephone
interview from New York. ``She severed her relationship (with
Mitchelson) and hired me.''
   Mitchelson, who established a live-in companion's right to
alimony-type payments in the celebrated ``palimony'' case against
actor Lee Marvin, refused to comment on reports of his firing,
referring questions to Felder.

   Six young black women were
killed and 17 people were injured Monday evening when a crowd
stampeded the front doors of a disco at an amusment park on the
edge of Soweto, police said.
   Police spokesman Lt. Col. Frans Malherbe said the huge Naledi
Disco at the Shareworld recreation center was less than half-full
when people trying to leave and those trying to enter began pushing
one another at the single door that served as both an entrance and
an exit.
   All the victims were trampled in the doorway, Malherbe said.
   Monday was a public holiday in South Africa and many of the
people at the disco had been drinking heavily, witnesses said.
   They said that at the time of the incident, a large number of
people were arriving at the disco from an all-day rock concert
nearby.
   Shareworld is near Soweto, the main black township outside
Johannesburg. The park is open to all races, although the crowds
are overwhelmingly black.

   Samuel A. Adams, a CIA analyst whose
accusations about intelligence estimates during the Vietnam War
formed the basis for a CBS documentary that prompted a celebrated
libel suit, died Monday of an apparent heart attack. He was 55.
   Adams, who joined the CIA in 1963, was an expert on the Viet
Cong, the guerrilla force North Vietnam organized in South Vietnam.
He contended that Army General William Westmoreland's military
intelligence officers had been ordered to underestimate the
strength of the guerrilla force to make it appear the
American-backed war was being won.
   The dispute over the Viet Cong strength was a major controversy
at the CIA, where Adams worked for 10 years. Adams contended the
CIA director, Richard Helms, also knew Westmoreland had rigged Viet
Cong battle statistics.
   The Adams controversy was the foundation for the CBS
documentary, ``The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception,'' which
resulted in a libel suit against the network by Westmoreland. The
general settled the case out of court after hearing testimony by
his former chief of military intelligence that confirmed charges
made by Adams.
   His account of the Vietnam controversy is contained in a book,
``Who the Hell Are We Fighting Out There?'' which he was completing
at the time of his death and which is to be published by W.W.
Norton in New York.

   Emperor Hirohito, ailing since Sept. 19, remained

   The 87-year-old emperor's fever stood at 99 degrees as of 9:00

   The emperor's normal temperature is about 95.9 degrees.
   Hirohito has been confined to his bed since he vomited a large
amount of blood three weeks ago.
   Since last Thursday he has discharged no blood, but he received
a transfusion of 0.42 pints Monday afternoon, bringing the total
amount of blood he has received in the past three weeks to 13.82
pints.
   Palace doctors, including Akira Takagi, have said they could not
determine whether the internal bleeding has completely stopped,
although no discharge of blood has been detected recently.
   News reports have said the emperor has pancreatic cancer, but
palace officials have neither confirmed nor denied the reports.

   Hank Williams Jr. won two Country Music
Association awards Monday night, including entertainer of the year
for the second straight year, upsetting favored Randy Travis, who
won as best male vocalist.
   Williams, son of the late Hank Williams, also won album of the
year for ``Born to Boogie'' in the nationally televised
presentation of the 22nd annual ceremony at the Grand Ole Opry
House.
   ``I love to entertain. When I'm on that stage I'm right at home.
It's a family tradition, you know,'' he said, alluding to one of
his songs.
   He shared top honors with relative newcomer K.T. Oslin, who was
voted female vocalist of the year and won song of the year for
``80's Ladies.''
   Oslin, who has been singing country music professionally for
only two years, ended a four-year reign by Reba McEntire in that
category. The 46-year-old singer has made her mark writing songs
from the viewpoint of a middle-aged woman.
   ``I watched this show for two years; one year I watched it
crying, and another year I couldn't watch it at all,'' Oslin said.
   Travis, a former dish washer and short order cook, won male
vocalist of the year for the second straight time, receiving the
award after host Dolly Parton walked into the crowd and sat on his
lap while introducing the nominees.
   ``After all that I found myself trying to remember what I'd just
won,'' he said.
   ``That's a great lineup of talent to be in,'' Travis said of his
fellow nominees. ``I tell you it's great for me to get to be around
those people and get to talk to them and actually know these
people.''
   Loretta Lynn and Roy Rogers became the 47th and 48th members of
the Country Music Hall of Fame. Lynn, born into poverty in the east
Kentucky coal fields, capped a 28-year career with the honor.
Rogers, the ``King of the Cowboys,'' was cited for his western
songs, such as ``Happy Trails to You.''
   Kathy Mattea's ``18 Wheels & a Dozen Roses'' was named single of
the year.
   It was the first CMA award for the 29-year-old Mattea, a former
tour guide at the Country Music Hall of Fame who had been nominated
six times before.
   Other winners included the mother and daughter team the Judds,
vocal duo of the year; veterans Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris and
Parton, top vocal event; Highway 101, group of the year; Ricky Van
Shelton, winner of the Horizon Award for up-and-coming talent; and
Chet Atkins, musician of the year for the ninth time.
   Earlier, Williams and other recording stars gathered to sign a
birthday card to Middle East hostage Terry A. Anderson.
   ``Hang in there, and when you come home we're gonna sing
together,'' Williams wrote on the card shortly before the program
began.
   ``That would be one of my best duets with anybody,'' said
Williams, who is said to be Anderson's favorite singer.
   Prior to the show, the artists signed the card, an 18- by
24-inch greeting with a yellow ribbon that reads, ``Happy Birthday
Terry! From Music City, USA! We all love you and pray for your
release!''
   Anderson turns 41 on Oct. 27. The chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press was abducted March 16, 1985.
   About 4,400 country music singers, writers and producers began
arriving two hours before the show, many in limousines as fans
lined the road leading to the rear stage entrance.

   Winners were chosen by the 7,000 singers, musicians,
songwriters, disc jockeys and others who are professionals in
country music. But Hall of Fame awards are selected by an anonymous
panel of judges.
   Other music ceremonies were scheduled throughout the week ln

   A newlywed couple was jailed for a drunken
brawl less than 10 hours after they exchanged vows, authorities
said.
   Roger McGee, 28, was released from jail Monday after pleading no
contest to resisting arrest merged with charges of disorderly
conduct and disorderly conduct while intoxicated stemming from
early Sunday's fight with his 19-year-old bride, Tamara Lynn McGee.
   The couple exchanged vows Saturday afternoon and nearly 10 hours
later, police were called to their home on a report that Mrs. McGee
had been assaulted.
   Police arrived to find McGee fighting with Miles Burch, 28, who
told authorities he was trying to help Mrs. McGee. But when police
tried to break up the fight, husband and wife fought with officers
and both had to be handcuffed, said patrolman Raymond West. Once
McGee was in the cruiser, he tried to kick out its rear window,
police said.
   Mrs. McGee was charged with resisting arrest and disorderly
conduct while intoxicated and released Sunday on $700 bond, said
Cindy Paysor, a municipal court clerk.
   Judge V. Paul Timko sentenced McGee to 10 days in jail and
ordered him to pay $250 and court costs, but suspended the jail
time and all but $50 of the fine and court costs, Ms. Paysor said.
   The bride, reached by telephone at her home Monday, declined to
comment.
   Burch was released on $50 bond and pleaded innocent to charges
including disorderly conduct.

<HEAD>Figure In Pentagon Procurement Scandal Contacted Boeing Despite
Pledge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A key figure in the Pentagon procurement
scandal violated a conflict-of-interest pledge not to associate
with his previous employer Boeing Co. while working at the
Pentagon, it was reported.
   A Senate oversight subcommittee recently reviewed the records of
a 1983 criminal investigation of possible conflicts of interest by
Melvyn R. Paisley in his dealings with Boeing Co., questioning
Pentagon lawyers at a recent unpublicized hearing. The subcommittee
made available records of the hearings to the Los Angeles Times.
   The subcommittee said Paisley, the former assistant Navy
secretary, urged government officials days after meeting with the
president of Boeing's helicopter unit to speed the development of a
tilt-rotor helicopter on which Boeing was the eventual winning
bidder, Senate investigators told the Times on Friday.
   Paisley, once the Navy's most powerful procurement official,
also recommended several top Boeing executives for positions on
sensitive Pentagon advisory boards during times he had disqualified
himself from dealings with the firm, the subcommittee said.
   Among them was James E. Gaines, who later became a deputy
assistant Navy secretary.
   Paisley's attorney, E. Lawrence Barcella Jr., said it was
appropriate for Paisley to recommend Boeing officials for service
as Pentagon advisers.
   ``The fact he had previously been employed by Boeing certainly
should not prohibit one of the country's major defense contractors
from participating in naval advisory boards,'' Barcella said.
   Gaines and Paisley are under investigation in Operation Ill
Wind, the far-ranging probe of Pentagon procurement expected to
result in indictments within a month, federal agents said.
   Paisley joined the Pentagon in 1981 after a 27-year career at
Boeing.
   Investigators are trying to determine whether Paisley received
payments from military contractors while serving as assistant Navy
secretary and whether he improperly obtained confidential Pentagon
data after he left the Pentagon in 1987 to become a defense
consultant.
   Sen. Carl M. Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the oversight
subcommittee, told Pentagon lawyers he was deeply disturbed by the
disclosures of Paisley's dealings with Boeing, according to a
transcript of the Sept. 29 hearing.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An opposition party leader has called
for a plebiscite to decide the Sandinista government's future.
   Erick Ramirez, head of the Nicaraguan Social Christian Party,
proposed a referendum ``that says `no' to the continuation of the
Sandinista government and totalitarian project, and `no' to the
violence and the repression.''
   Ramirez set no specific date for the referendum, which he
proposed while presiding over his party's 31st anniversary
celebration. There was no immediate response to the call from the
Sandinistas.
   The opposition party leader also said he might ask the recently
formed five-party coalition, the Democratic Alliance of the
Opposition, to condemn Sandinista leaders who ``have driven
Nicaragua to a fatal precipice''.
   The Sandinista National Liberation Front has ruled Nicaragua
since July 1979 when it overthrew the rightist dictator Anastasio
Somoza.
   Nicaragua's five opposition political parties formed the
alliance on Oct. 4 ``to invigorate the fight of the people, using
civil, democratic and patriotic solutions to the severe crisis
shaking Nicaragua.''
   Ramirez on Sunday accused the Sandinistas of failing to honor
the Esquipulas II peace accords signed by Central American
countries last year.
   They are ``opportunists ... who only have sought their own
well-being,'' he said.
   Just before the alliance's formation, Ramirez announced a
``broad block of civic-political opposition'' with the
participation of former Sandinista Eden Pastora. Known by his war
pseudonym ``Commander Zero,'' Pastora helped lead the fight against
Somoza.
   At that time, Ramirez defined the new opposition block as the
``third option'' that would offer different alternatives ``to the
radical polarized positions'' that exist in Nicaragua.
   The reference was to the leftist Sandinista and a U.S.-backed
rebel band, called the Contras.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega later responded that
Nicaragua does not have three options. ``You are either with the
revolution or with the foreign aggressor,'' the Sandinista
president said.
   When proposing the plebiscite Sunday, Ramirez said Nicaragua's
opposition parties ``should be on the offensive'' and coordinate
forces ``in the common fight for national salvation.''
   The Social-Christian leader also said he would continue to fight
for ``total amnesty'' for political prisoners who have been jailed
in the nine years since the fall of the Somoza regime.

   She lives in a white castle-shaped
building with a room full of miniature European castles, cathedrals
and houses surrounded by tiny brass cars and hand-painted people.
   Trudy Thuijs' late husband, Arthur, constructed the 45 buildings
on a scale of { inch per foot.
   With a Strauss waltz playing in the background, visitors walk
around the black-painted room and its islands of tiny buildings
encircled by moving trains.
   The Miniature Kingdom has a replica of the Castle Neuschwanstein
in Fussen, Germany; the Kremlin and Red Square in Moscow; and a
hotel on the Riviera with a beach covered by umbrellas and chairs.
The Cathedral of the Assumption of the Holy Virgin recreates the
original 1479 building in Moscow down to the domes gilded with real
gold and silver.
   ``To me, these buildings are works of art. It's a view of
architecture and time's past,'' said Mrs. Thuijs, 48. ``You can't
experience it (the real building) the way you could here.''
   Miniature Kingdom is one of five tiny villages researched,
designed and built by her husband, a native of Holland who died in
1984. He sold the others located in The Hague, Holland; Lake
Lugano, Switzerland; Klagenfurt, Austria; and Dusseldorf, West
Germany.
   Thuijs started crafting miniatures in the 1950s after years of
designing hotels, restaurants and government buildings in Europe.
   He built the Miniature Kingdom buildings in Holland, and was
persuaded to move them to the Great Adventure theme park near
Jackson in 1974 by the park's builder, Warner Leroy, according to
Mrs. Thuijs.
   She met her husband while working at Great Adventure, where the
miniature buildings were kept outdoors.
   Eventually, the couple looked for an indoor home for the display
and a place to retire. They chose Washington, a rural northern New
Jersey community about 15 miles east of the Pennsylvania border.
   Mrs. Thuijs said the exhibit was valued at $550,000 when built
in the 1960s and now is worth more than $1 million. But she has no
plans to sell Miniature Kingdom.
   Each building, made of Swedish masonite to withstand the
weather, took three to six months to build. Thuijs spent 1{ years
working on the Castle Neuschwanstein, patterned after its 1869
German namesake constructed for King Ludwig II of Bavaria.
   The castle and the Georgian House _ a model of a 1710 London
mansion _ are among Mrs. Thuijs' favorites.
   ``I tend to the more ornate buildings,'' she said.
   She thinks her husband chose the buildings he re-created because
he had seen them during his travels in Belgium, Holland, Germany,
the Soviet Union, Poland, England and Switzerland.
   Only one miniature scene is out of place among those of Europe:
New York Harbor.
   ``It was the first step in what was going to be a very expanded
miniature village at Great Adventure,'' Mrs. Thuijs said. ``He was
to create another set of miniatures, but because of financial
problems (at the theme park) he didn't continue.''

   The Rev. Barry Harris admits he
sometimes gets the itch to play the horses. And it's a difficult
urge to avoid working around 1,100 of them on the ``back side'' at
Fairmount Park Race Track.
   Harris began ministering to the ``nomadic'' peoples on the back
side _ the area behind the grandstand where horses train and
trainers sleep _ in May 1985.
   ``I had the feeling that some of my brother ministers treated me
with some suspicion, and were a bit cool toward me,'' the Southern
baptist said, recalling his start.
   ``Just for the simple fact that I'm here where betting, gambling
takes place. I just figured it wasn't my job to judge, but to
minister.''
   Thrice weekly, starting at 8 a.m., Harris broadcasts an
``economical'' prayer and devotional message over the
public-address system to the track's 1,500 workers.
   He then strolls around to the stables, meeting members of the
horse-racing industry, including jockeys, horse owners and trainers.
   The 44-year-old Harris, born in nearby East St. Louis, says
people seek his counsel for many reasons, including problems with
relationships, health or downright boredom.
   ``Whatever turns up, that's what I'll deal with,'' said the
silver-haired reverend, wearing brown leather boots, faded blue
jeans, a crisp white shirt, a gray-blue-and-brown tie and a
cream-colored jacket.
   ``That's where I find out about the wedding that's being
planned. I did one in the winner's circle,'' he recalled, laughing.
The groom was a jockey.
   Harris, who also works at the track two evenings weekly, holds a
Bible study Tuesdays in the Horsemen's Lounge. On Thursdays, before
racing starts, he has a devotional service for the jockeys.
   He says people who work the back side, which at Fairmount
shelters about 1,100 horses, need a chaplain because their
migratory life doesn't permit them to put down roots.
   ``They're a nomadic people,'' he said. ``They're not plugged
into the community where they are.''
   Harris said it wasn't that he dreamed of growing up to become a
track chaplain. He never gave it much thought, really, though his
father, a steel worker, traded horses part time.
   He graduated from a Belleville high school in 1961, got married
and started working on the railroad. Then around age 24, in search
of another career, Harris entered the ministry.
   While serving as pastor at Highland Southern Baptist Church,
Harris sought to supplement his church's income to finance a
building expansion in 1985. The track job came open and he took it,
replacing another Southern Baptist minister.
   The job has existed since 1979, supported by the Horsemen's
Benevolent and Protective Association.
   ``I love it here,'' Harris said. ``Yeah, you get the urge every
once in a while'' to bet. ``But it's not in my game.''
   He doesn't try to justify the legalized betting at the track,
which Southern Baptists don't look kindly upon. ``It's not there
for me to approve or disapprove,'' he said. ``It's there.
   ``I am not God. I cannot stop these things. I am here to
administer to persons.''

   People living in the West were the most likely
to have been crime victims last year while residents of the
Northeast were the least likely to have been victimized, the
government says.
   Nationally, crime levels in the United States rose 1.8 percent
in 1987, ending a five-year decline, the Bureau of Justice
Statistics reported Sunday.
   The number of criminal victimizations rose some 613,000 in 1987
to more than 34.7 million, with increases compared to 1986 in the
amount of both personal and household crime.
   Even with the increase over 1986, there were 16 percent fewer
crimes last year than in 1981, the peak year for crime with 41.5
million criminal victimizations, said Joseph Bessette, the bureau's
acting director.
   In 1986, the number of crimes hit the lowest level in the
15-year history of the government's national crime survey, 34.1
million.
   Last year, the number of personal crimes rose nearly 250,000 or
1.4 percent from 1986 to just over 19 million, with increases in
all four categories of rape, robbery, assault and theft.
   The amount of household crime rose by nearly 360,000 or 2.3
percent to 15.7 million, with increases in burglary, larceny and
motor vehicle theft.
   Reagan administration officials have tried to depict declines as
a result of sterner law enforcement and a more cooperative public.
Some academic experts analyzing the data have stressed that the
size of the most crime-prone age group, those in their middle to
late teens, has grown smaller in the 1980s.
   The numbers of personal crimes per 1,000 people last year were
125 in the West, 101 in the Midwest, 91 in the South and 71 in the
Northeast. The household crime figures per 1,000 residents were 223
in the West, 166 in the Midwest, 179 in the South and 116 in the
Northeast.
   The West was the only region to show an increase in the personal
crime rate last year compared to 1986, up 8.6 percent. In the South
the rate fell by 4.8 percent, while the Northeast and Midwest
showed no significant change.

   Advocates of failed legislation to combat
urban smog, acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals are looking to
the next president to supply leadership to help break Congress'
biggest environmental impasse.
   ``I suspect whoever gets elected _ George Bush or Michael
Dukakis _ will be better than Ronald Reagan,'' says Sen. Tim Wirth,
D-Colo., summing up what is becoming a bipartisan litany among
environmentalists.
   ``Whichever administration comes in will probably be much more
supportive of environmental legislation than this one,'' says Sen.
Robert Stafford, R-Vt., who frequently found himself at odds with
the Reagan White House.
   ``It looks like it's going to take a new president,'' adds
Richard Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition, a
consortium of environmental, public health and labor groups.
   Sounding a note of pessimism is Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine,
who spent much of 1988 trying to unite disparate factions on what
would have been the first major rewriting of the Clean Air Act in
11 years.
   ``I believe that many who say they support clean air have
naively placed too much confidence in Vice President Bush's
(environmental) statements than they warrant,'' Mitchell said last
week as he ended efforts to find an air-quality compromise this
year.
   ``I don't think it will make much difference with him,'' said
Mitchell, adding that Bush's call for a reduction of ``millions''
of tons of the acid-rain chemical sulfur dioxide is vague compared
to Dukakis' call for a 12 million ton cut in sulfur dioxide
emissions from coal-burning plants.
   ``He could push for a 3 million ton cut and not still violate a
campaign pledge,'' says Mitchell, calling for a minimum reduction
of 10 million tons.
   Both presidential candidates have been talking up a cleaner
environment on the campaign trail, which contrasts sharply with the
Reagan administration's early frontal attacks on environmental laws
and running battles with Congress.
   The administration's record hasn't been entirely negative.
Spurred by the warnings of scientists, it supported the
international agreement to reduce emissions of chemicals that are
destroying the Earth's ozone layer.
   But on a number of other environmental issues _ including acid
rain, toxic wastes and strip mining _ it has been widely accused of
foot-dragging or worse.
   The next president and the 101st Congress are likely to find an
increasingly global focus to the issue of air quality, which
heretofore has been framed in terms of smoggy cities and lakes and
trees harmed by acid rain.
   For the last two years, scientists have been appearing before an
ever widening circle of House and Senate committees to deliver
frightening warnings about global warming called the greenhouse
effect.
   They say a variety of factors, from burning fossil fuels such as
coal and petroleum to destruction of tropical rain forests, are
overloading the atmosphere with greenhouse gases that trap heat
that normally would escape into space.
   No one is directly linking this summer's drought and record
temperatures to global warming, but witnesses say more such
conditions, along with coastal flooding, can be expected sometime
in the next century.
   Scientists are divided over when average temperatures will climb
to dangerous levels, but some warn that even if greenhouse gases
were controlled tomorrow, the Earth may already be committed to its
hottest period in 100,000 years.
   Greenhouse control bills have been introduced on both sides of
Congress calling for a variety of remedies including better energy
efficiency, development of alternatives to fossil fuel and
international cooperation.
   Wirth, who has chaired some of the greenhouse hearings, says
global warming may be the catalyst that can break the air-quality
impasse that stems from competing economic and regional interests
in this country.
   ``I think that's where the possibility may be,'' said Wirth, who
along with Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., is trying to interest the
presidential candidates in a joint plan relying heavily on economic
incentives to curb greenhouse emissions.
   Witnesses have told Wirth's hearings there would be day-to-day
side benefits from attacking the greenhouse problem: saving energy
could reduce emissions of acid rain chemicals; vehicles with better
fuel mileage not only would cut carbon emissions contributing to
the greenhouse effect but also would emit less smog-producing
chemicals.
   The global warming threat also offers the next administration a
new frontier for relations with the Soviet Union. The two nations
are estimated to be responsible for 45 percent of the world's
greenhouse gases.
   Wirth says failure of the latest effort to strengthen the Clean
Air Act demonstrates the need for a partnership between the White
House and Congress in dealing with the far more complicated and
ominous problem of global warming.
   ``It shows how difficult it is to push something uphill without
administration support,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   This agricultural hamlet of 350 people
on the banks of the Rio Grande has languished for decades, but
residents say a planned bridge to Texas to handle Mexico's booming
trade will spark change.
   But nearby towns already with bridges spanning the border are
concerned they may lose business.
   One is hedging its bets: it's helping finance construction of
Colombia's bridge to make money off the tolls.
   ``We need industries to come for our youth,'' said farmer
Tiburcio Tapia Lopez, born in Colombia in 1910. ``This town needs
some life.''
   Tapia and Colombia's 93 other communal farmers barely eke out a
living on the sorghum and corn they sell at market. He and his wife
Yolanda have nine children, all but one of whom went to other
Mexican cities or to the United States to work.
   Eloy Cantu, Nuevo Leon state secretary for development and
planning, said the bridge linking Colombia with a private tract of
land near an unincorporated site called Dolores, Texas, could be
under construction as soon as February.
   Cantu said the bridge will offer the most streamlined customs
operation along the nearly 2,000-mile border and may include
``shared customs'' so cargo trucks are checked by American and
Mexican officials simultaneously.
   ``It'll be a showcase,'' Cantu said in an interview in the state
capital of Monterrey, northern Mexico's largest and most
industrialized city.
   Nuevo Leon is the only U.S.-Mexico border state without an
international bridge, Cantu said.
   Mexico, in a severe economic crisis since 1982, joined the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, two years ago. The
move lowered import duties on hundreds of foreign products and for
the first time made exports of manufactured goods a No. 1 priority.
   Joining GATT was a sign the country is trying to reduce its
reliance on petroleum export revenues, which plummeted with the
price of oil from $14.7 billion in 1983 to $7.8 billion last year.
   Exports of manufactured goods, meanwhile, soared by 116 percent
during the 5-year period from 1983 to 1987.
   Total manufactured exports in 1987 hit $9.9 billion, according
to Banco de Mexico figures.
   In the first six months of this year, manufactured exports were
up by 23 percent over the same period last year, according to the
Industry and Commerce Department.
   Now there's talk of building or improving international bridges
all along the border to handle the unending streams of 18-wheel
cargo trucks that go back and forth from Mexico to the United
States.
   Tapia said Colombia had a short heyday in his youth when his
father operated a ferry that carried Mexican workers to the coal
mines at Dolores and brought supplies from the United Statess.
   ``That ended about 1925,'' he said. ``Since then there's been no
work here.''
   Nuevo Leon still has to make major road improvements to
Colombia, build customs houses and upgrade water and electricity
systems.
   But while Colombia is rejoicing, the twin cities of Nuevo Laredo
in Tamaulipas state and Laredo, Texas, just 24 miles downstream,
are concerned.
   Laredo, which will pay half the estimated $1 million cost of the
bridge and earn toll revenues from it, would fare the best,
although City Managuer Marvin Townsend said Laredo will fight any
attempts to build a road bypassing it on the Texas side.
   Both cities earn millions on the truck trade through bridge
tolls, customs brokers, trucking companies, motels, restaurants,
banks, insurance companies and government offices that monitor the
industry.
   Both Laredos agree another bridge is needed. But they had hoped
a third one would be built there first.
   ``Nuevo Laredo's main source of income is international trade,''
said Sergio Lujan, vice president of the Nuevo Laredo Association
of Customs Agents.
   ``My colleagues are very, very concerned about the competition.
They fear Nuevo Leon will try to sponsor its own border town and
make it grow,'' he said.
   Cantu said limited development is planned in Colombia and that
the state's main goal is to slow growth in the sprawling,
water-short Monterrey by encouraging growth in Anahuac, a city of
about 30,000 people 40 miles south of Colombia.

<HEAD>Business Executives Looking for Economic Slowdown</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One year after the stock market crash,
America's business leaders are looking back on a year of
surprisingly strong growth and ahead to what in some ways would be
a welcome slowdown.
   Economists widely expected the economy to topple into a
recession this year or at best into a period of sluggishness.
Instead, business has been good and many of the executives gathered
last weekend for the semiannual meeting of the Business Council
sounded like Roger B. Smith, chairman of General Motors Corp.
   ``The U.S. auto industry is just finishing their 1988 model
year, which needless to say was a very, very good year for us,''
said Smith, who in 1989 and 1990 will serve as chairman of the
council, composed of 62 chief executives from the country's biggest
corporations.
   A panel of about 20 economists from member companies is
predicting growth this year, as measured by the gross national
product, of 4 percent. If realized, that would be the best since
1984.
   However, economic growth will slow to 2.5 percent next year and
to below 2 percent in 1990, the panel predicted. They've been
making a similar prediction for two years now.
   Citicorp Chairman John S. Reed, who delivers the council's
economic report, said that once again the group's consultants
``suggest that next year things will begin to slow down a little
bit.''
   Even another year of unexpected growth would only ``put off for
another year the expected slowdown,'' he said.
   But if the economists undershoot again, the implications could
be grim.
   The Federal Reserve Board has been pushing up interest rates in
an attempt to fight inflation by curbing growth.
   If the Fed doesn't see the ``soft landing'' it desires, it may
force rates still higher, precipitating an actual contraction of
the economy, a recession, instead of just sluggishness.
   So, when Reed was asked how he could describe a prediction of a
slowdown as optimistic, he replied, ``There is nothing called a
recession in this forecast.''
   The area of the economy expected to slow the most, according to
the economic panel, is consumer demand and the executives are
tailoring their plans to that expectation.
   Smith predicted a ``rationalization of capacity'' in the auto
industry over the next few years, meaning outdated plants will be
closed and, perhaps, jobs lost.
   Philip M. Hawley, chairman of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., a
department store chain, said retailers are expecting only
``reasonably moderate growth'' in holiday sales.
   If growth in consumer spending was more vigorous, as it was in
1982-86, that would have ``long-range implications for the economy
that were not good,'' including higher imports at a time when the
United States is trying to shrink its trade deficit.
   In between rounds of golf and sets of tennis at the Homestead, a
posh resort in the mountains of western Virginia, the executives
met behind closed doors to hear from politicians and experts on two
subjects: education and the federal budget deficit. The news was
not good.
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said only 15 to 20 percent of the nation's children are
receiving an adequate education.
   Yet, according to Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and a former U.S.
commissioner of education in the Carter administration, neither of
the presidential candidates has put forward a coherent education
program.
   There's been ``a strange silence,'' he said.
   Robert S. Strauss, co-chairman of a high-level government
commission working on a budget deficit reduction plan for the next
president, said he is of ``reasonably good cheer'' about the
prospects of proposing a ``constructive and worthwhile'' solution.
   But Strauss and his fellow co-chairman, former Reagan
administration Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis, said their
recommendation would fail without the support of the next president.
   Republican candidate George Bush has already said he will ignore
the recommendation if it includes a tax increase. Democrat Michael
Dukakis' chief revenue-raising proposal is more efficient tax
collection. Neither candidate has proposed substantial spending
cuts.
   ``Without support from the White House ... Congress isn't going
to fall on its sword to please our commission,'' Lewis said.
``There's got to be a joint effort here.''

<HEAD>Beef Price Hikes to Slow</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cattle prices are being pushed higher this
fall by hefty demand and smaller supplies, but Agriculture
Department analysts say consumers may not see much further effect
at retail beef counters.
   ``Livestock producers are coping with substantially higher feed
costs as a result of the 1988 drought,'' says the department's
Economic Research Service. ``Feed grain and protein meal prices are
up, and beef and dairy farmers in drought areas will face higher
winter forage costs.''
   But the agency added that ``producers are adjusting gradually,
without major liquidations or drops in production.''
   Cash receipts from livestock sales are expected to rise slightly
from last year's $76.2 billion, but higher feed costs will reduce
net incomes.
   The commercial slaughter of cows from beef and dairy herds
through the end of August remained at about 7 percent below a year
earlier, indicating that no massive herd liquidations occurred as
had been feared earlier when the drought worsened.
   ``Even so, this summer's drought likely resulted in some cows
being slaughtered ahead of the normal culling period because of
poor forage conditions,'' the agency said in a new issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine. ``An even greater increase could
occur later this year.''
   But cow slaughter in the third quarter was expected to be about
1.6 million head, down 4 percent from July, August and September
1987. Third-quarter increases in cow slaughter are common, and this
year's seasonal increase was about average for the last five years.
   In the fourth quarter, cow slaughter _ a major source of
hamburger and other beef for processing _ also usually increase,
but this time the gain is expected to be far less than the 5-year
average of 18 percent.
   The fourth-quarter slaughter increase slowed to 10 percent in
1986 and to 5 percent last year, the report said. This fall's
increase is also expected to be around 5 percent.
   ``Fewer cows going to slaughter, as well as seasonally declining
steer and heifer slaughter in coming months, should reduce
available beef supplies during the remainder of the year,'' the
report said.
   Market prices of fed cattle dropped to the mid-$60s per 100
pounds by late September from more than $71 earlier in the month as
more animals went to slaughter.
   ``The relatively strong prices this summer reflected increased
demand for beef exports and continued strong demand by retail,
hotel, restaurant and institutional establishments at a time of
nearly record retail prices,'' the report said. ``Cattle prices
could move even higher during the fourth quarter as beef production
declines by up to 10 percent from the summer quarter.''
   However, the report added, the rising cattle prices ``are not
expected to push retail beef prices much higher'' because marketing
margins, or the markup between producer and consumer, ``should
begin to narrow and a larger share of the consumer's dollar will be
returned to producers.''

   The public has almost a month to file comments
with the Agriculture Department on a rule-change proposal that
would allow ``a wider variety of binders'' in processed meat and
poultry.
   Binders are additives that act as extenders and to hold products
together. For example, the proposal would allow such additives in
``chili con carne'' and a number of other products.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said the agency has received
requests from a number of companies asking for the rule change.
   ``The petitioners have made a reasonable request, considering
that these binders, including wheat gluten, tapioca dextrin, whey
protein concentrate and sodium caseinate, are generally approved as
safe for use in food, and are already approved for use in many
products including spaghetti and meatballs and poultry rolls.''
   But the binders are currently allowed in specific meat and
poultry products as part of individual product standards, he said.
Under the proposal, the binders would be listed in federal
regulations under a table of ``approved substances.''
   The listing would name the binders, the products they can be
used in, the approved purpose and the use levels.
   Interested persons should submit comments by Nov. 7 to: Policy
Office, Attn: Linda Carey, Hearing Clerk, FSIS, USDAa, Room 3175-S,

   The Soviet Union says its 1988 grain harvest
is almost wrapped up, somewhat ahead of last year when heavy rains
delayed progress, says an Agriculture Department report.
   Soviet watchers in the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
said Soviet press reports put the harvest at 93 percent complete as
of Sept. 26, with threshing of grain done on 100.9 million
hectares. A year ago, 95.7 million hectares had been threshed by
Sept. 28.
   The USDA has forecast total Soviet grain output this year at 205
million metric tons, down from 211.4 million tons in 1987 and 210.1
million tons in 1986, but still one of the largest yields on record.
   One hectare is about 2.47 acres and a metric ton is
approximately 2,205 pounds.

<HEAD>Campaign '88: Neither Bush Nor Dukakis Has Plan to Reduce Deficits</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Another in a series of stories on major issues in the
presidential race</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   When Ronald Reagan entered the White House in
1981, the national debt was less than $1 trillion. Today it has
soared to $2.6 trillion, and the interest alone is costing
taxpayers $210 billion _ more than the nation's elderly receive in
Social Security benefits.
   So what do Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis
propose to do about the budget deficit?
   Despite Bush's talk of a ``flexible freeze'' on most government
spending and Dukakis' hopes of reaping tens of billions of dollars
through vigorous tax collection, economists say neither
presidential candidate has put forward a credible plan for mopping
up the tidal wave of red ink.
   The deficit, however, has not emerged as a major campaign issue
despite gloomy prognostications from some economists. Neither Bush
nor Dukakis has felt much pressure to fill in the blanks of his
deficit-reduction promises.
   Bush's oft-repeated vow is, ``I will not raise your taxes,
period.'' In 1980, he derided Reagan's promise to balance the
budget while cutting taxes and raising military spending as
``voodoo economics.'' Now the vice president is following in
Reagan's footsteps by promising more tax cuts and vowing to keep
hands off Social Security.
   The vice president has offered a ``flexible freeze'' on
government spending except for Social Security and interest
payments on the national debt. He would limit the overall growth of
other government spending to the rate of inflation, with increases
in some areas offset by unspecified cuts elsewhere.
   ``It's a commitment to slow the growth of government spending to
make even better progress in reducing the budget deficit than we
have been doing and are projected to do,'' said Michael J. Boskin,
a Stanford University economics professor and senior Bush adviser.
``Exactly when it would lead to a balanced budget depends on how
well the economy does.''
   Boskin said the annual deficit, which in 1983 was the equivalent
of 6.3 percent of the gross national product, is down to 3.2
percent of GNP and is headed to 1.8 percent of GNP in 1993 even
without the flexible freeze, according to a Congressional Budget
Office forecast.
   To critics who question how Bush will achieve his goal while
exempting Social Security, Boskin says, ``It leaves most of the
budget.'' He said Bush is committed to negotiating spending
restraints with Congress, but ``he doesn't think it's appropriate
that he lay out a detailed fiscal 1990 budget during the
presidential campaign.''
   Like Reagan, Bush espouses a balanced budget amendment and
line-item veto authority. Dukakis opposes both. Says Bush: ``The
most important action we need to take on the budget deficit is to
hold the line on taxing and spending.''
   Dukakis says tax increases would be only ``a last resort'' but
that ``no serious candidate can rule out the possibility of new
taxes.'' His first resort, he says, would be tougher tax
enforcement.
   Dukakis knows that fellow Democrat Walter Mondale helped doom
his 1984 campaign against Reagan by declaring that higher taxes
were inevitable. So Dukakis talks of raising tens of billions of
dollars through a one-time tax amnesty and tougher enforcement.
   ``This is not a pie-in-the-sky formula,'' says Dukakis, who
estimates that $110 billion in taxes go uncollected each year.
   Tom Herman, a senior Dukakis campaign adviser, said Dukakis
hopes to net $10 billion from tax cheats in the first year and $30
billion annually by 1993.
   ``There are only four ways to reduce the federal budget deficit:
cut spending, increase revenue, lower interest rates and improve
economic performance. We must do all four,'' says the Democratic
nominee.
   Dukakis has called for spending cuts on Star Wars, the
space-based missile defense system, and some weapons programs. He
promises to make ``tough choices'' elsewhere in the budget,
including unspecified savings on agriculture, welfare and health
care.
   He also would cut back development of a supersonic space plane
and pare support for nuclear fission and fusion research. He rules
out Social Security cuts.
   Alice Rivlin, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and
former director of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office,
said both candidates have been vague about what they would do about
the deficit.
   ``Neither has put out any kind of a solid plan to bring the
deficit down,'' she said. ``The reason for that is there really
isn't a good plan which can avoid an increase in taxes. Nobody
wants to dramatize that fact.''
   Lawrence Chimerine, chairman and chief economist of the WEFA
Group, said Bush would aggravate the deficit with a series of tax
cuts or credits he has promised, from lower taxes on capital gains
to a $1,000 ``toddler tax credit'' for poor families.
   Dukakis might find some savings in military and domestic
spending and bring in more revenues by bolstering the Internal
Revenue Service, ``but we're talking very small numbers,''
Chimerine said.
   Both candidates are counting on lower interest rates to help
reduce the deficit, but that is not necessarily within the
president's power to deliver.
   ``It's Catch-22,'' said Chimerine. ``You can't get the drop in
interest rates until you put forth a credible program, but
fundamentally the drop in interest rates is essentially what their
program is.''
   David Keating, executive vice president of the National
Taxpayers Union, said, ``Bush's flexible freeze could work if he
could get Congress to follow it. But every time the vice president
is in a debate or public forum, he seems to come up with another
spending program.''
   Economist Michael Evans said both candidates are ``up a tree''
in their quest for lower interest rates.
   ``Interest rates are likely to rise if the deficit rises,'' he
said. ``The Fed (Federal Reserve Board) is going to have to defend
the dollar next year, and that's going to push the deficit higher.''
   The Fed often raises interest rates to defend the dollar, but
that also would drive up the government's own borrowing costs and
increase the deficit.
   Rivlin said the flexible freeze idea ``sounds good, but when you
look at it, it means Medicare and Medicaid would have to be cut
substantially or you'd have to cut a lot of other spending.''
   While Bush has said cutting the capital gains tax rate will
generate revenues, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated it
will result in lost revenues of $3.9 billion a year. Some estimates
are even higher.
   Democrats on Capitol Hill say Bush's other proposals, such as
child care tax credits and tax-deferred savings accounts for
middle-income families, would cost several billion dollars in
revenues.
   Bush and Dukakis have another excuse for staying mum on deficit
reduction. A bipartisan National Economic Commission is to report
early next year on ways to do the job.
   Both candidates disavowed a recent statement by the commission's
co-chairman, Robert Strauss, that the only way to solve the deficit
problem is to go after Social Security and other entitlements.
   The commission could help the country end its deficit-spending
binge of the 1980s, Rivlin said, but ``only if the new president
wants it to. If the president wants it, he'll have lots of help.''

<HEAD>Campaign '88: Not Much Attention on Classroom Substance</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: One in a series of stories on major issues in the
presidential race. First moved for Sunday AMs.</NOTE>

   As Election Day nears, education remains at
best a marginal issue in the 1988 campaign _ the stuff of political
rhetoric and modest promises, but not a cutting-edge issue for
either candidate.
   More attention has been paid to whether teachers should be
compelled to lead the Pledge of Allegiance at the start of each
school day than to what students learn after that patriotic ritual.
   George Bush has said repeatedly he wants to go down in history
as ``the education president.'' The Republican candidate tells
voters wherever he goes that better schools are the key to a better
future for America.
   Michael Dukakis, too, asserts that he wants to be ``the
education president.'' The Democrat gets big cheers every time he
promises, ``We're going to make teaching a valued and honored
profession again.''
   Whichever candidate wins on Nov. 8, educators are confident the
education budget will be in safer hands under the next president
than under Ronald Reagan.
   But they say neither Bush, who attended private schools as a
youngster, nor Dukakis, who attended public schools, has done
enough to dramatize the problems facing American schools or to
spell out a convincing plan to improve performance.
   Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, said, ``We hear strong inspirational
statements about how important education is, but the direction the
`education president' would take is still not clear.''
   At the outset of the campaign, ``the candidates were stumbling
all over themselves to say this was America's most urgent
obligation,'' said Boyer. ``It faded as a central issue.''
   Richard Berendzen, president of The American University in
Washington, said, ``I grade both on what I hear and what I don't
hear. ... I'd give both a D-plus.''
   Berendzen said 25 percent of American young people drop out of
high school and 20 percent grow up in poverty, and the United
States is far back on international scholastic tests.
   ``If you take a sober look at the matter, you could say that the
preparation of our youth today and workforce readiness for the year
2000 is one of the two or three top issues facing America,'' said
Berendzen.
   Despite the generalities, said College Board President Donald M.
Stewart, ``It is obvious both candidates are making the link
between economic productivity and international competitiveness and
the underserved, undereducated poor.''
   However, Dennis Doyle, a Hudson Institute scholar, said it is
inevitable that education will slip to the back of the president's
agenda.
   ``Education is 15th or 20th on the real list the president will
actually keep, as apart from a campaignlist,'' said Doyle. ``The
deficit, defense, international relations, economic problems, even
health care, Social Security, transportation and housing all are
higher on their priority list.''
   Both candidates have outlined ways to help families cope with
the soaring costs of college _ Bush with a tax-free savings bond
plan, and Dukakis with a new loan program that students would repay
through payroll deductions.
   Bush, whose administration tried to cut $5 billion from the
Education Department last year, now is proposing bigger spending
increases than his rival.
   Here are their major education proposals:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _$500 million for a ``merit schools'' program that would reward
schools that raise the academic scores of disadvantaged students.
Schools would get up to $100,000 each to spend as they saw fit.
   _$50 million for matching grants to create more ``magnet''
schools that emphasize various academic subjects.
   _Expanding from $12 million to $50 million a proposed Fund for
Innovation and Reform of Schools and Teaching to give each state $1
million for an experimental district trying such concepts as
parental choice, merit pay or year-round schools.
   _Money for Head Start, the $1.2 billion pre-school program for
disadvantaged children, would be ``sharply increased'' by an
unspecified amount. Bush said he is committed to building Head
Start ``to a level where all eligible 4-year-olds can attend
classes.'' The Children's Defense Fund says the 453,000 children
now in Head Start are only 16 percent of those eligible.
   Bush has also promised to spend more on Chapter 1, a $4.6
billion remedial program that serves about 55 percent of eligible
poor students.
   _Tax-free U.S. Savings Bonds for college tuition. This would
eventually cost the Treasury $200 million a year; the tax break
would be phased out for families earning $60,000 to $80,000 or
above.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DUKAKIS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _$250 million for a National Teaching Excellence Fund to provide
college scholarships and forgive loans for those who become
teachers, launch a new National Teacher Corps, create state teacher
retraining centers, recruit retirees to teach, and support a
five-fold expansion of a $1.9 million Christa McAuliffe Fellowship
program for talented teachers.
   _$25 million for a ``Citizens Literacy Corps'' to support
volunteer efforts to teach illiterates to read.
   _A Student Tuition and Repayment System (STARS) allowing
students to pay back college loans through payroll deductions in
their working years. It would supplement, not replace, existing
federal grants and loans, at least at the start. Students would get
STARS loans from banks.
   Dukakis officials have suggested a payback rate of one-eighth to
one-quarter of 1 percentage point of earnings per $1,000 borrowed,
meaning a tax of 2.5 to 5 percent for a $20,000 borrower.
   The rate stays the same for low- and high-income earners, but
the loan is never paid off.

   The other day Darleen Reilly picked up the
phone and called a local radio station to play a game it calls
``Name That Sound.'' She correctly identified a ``rack being rolled
into the dishwasher,'' and came away $4,000 richer.
   Then the disc jockeys turned to politics.
   One of them described the irony of Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle
_ ``these two millionaires,'' he said derisively _ sharing a stage
in Omaha to discuss all the good things they would do for the
common man.
   It was a cynical moment, but the presidential campaigns have
invited this sort of contempt. From the moment the conventions
ended in August, it's been a dispiriting race. It began trivial,
quickly turned negative, and now it's gotten worse.
   George Bush generally gets the blame for touching off the
trivia. Budget deficits are enormous, a drug epidemic has hit
practically every strata of society, superpower relations at a
turning point, farmers coming off another tough year, nine
Americans remain hostage in Lebanon ...
   With all this facing the next president, Bush has been
bludgeoning Dukakis over the Pledge of Allegiance and a
Massachusetts prison furlough program. He initiated a made-for-TV
battle of cop endorsements and summoned reporters to Boston Harbor
to ridicule Dukakis over its filth _ while refusing to answer
questions about administration environmental vetoes.
   It got so bad that Richard Nixon, of all people, described
campaign '88 as ``trivial, superficial and inane.'' Nixon said Bush
and Dukakis ``have found that the surest way they could make the
evening news was to be silly or irresponsible or both.''
   Barry Goldwater, summoned for an Arizona campaign appearance,
startled Quayle by telling his fellow Republican: ``I hope you'll
take this kindly. But I want you to go back and tell George Bush to
start talking about the issues.''
   Don't hold your breath. Trivializing is working for Bush: He's
come from behind to enjoy a comfy lead in the polls and he
continues to put Dukakis on the defensive on these ``gut issues''
(Dukakis finally answered on Saturday after a week of Bush abuse on
crime policy).
   Behind in the polls, the Dukakis people figured they better
answer in kind. They saw that voters seemed to respond to the
negative campaign and though it would be nice to get off the
defensive for a change.
   Dukakis had been delivering some issue-oriented speeches on
defense, health insurance, college education, but now the high road
would take a back seat to a new series of starkly negative campaign
ads.
   No sooner did the millionaires' debate end then Dukakis hit the
air with some anti-Quayle commercials.
   A spot called ``Oval Office'' features scenes of Harry Truman,
Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford taking their presidential oaths as a
narrator says one in five vice presidents has had to rise to the
presidency.
   ``For this job, after five months of reflection, George Bush
made his personal choice _ J. Danforth Quayle,'' the ad says.
``Hopefully, we will never know how great a lapse of judgment that
really was.''
   The Bush campaign, meanwhile, is airing tough ads criticizing
Dukakis' prison furlough program, tax hikes and other aspects of
his record as Massachusetts governor _ spending about $4 million
last week alone.
   The victim of one furloughed inmate flew to California last week
to cut some radio ads for Bush. What the ads won't say is that
President Reagan, as governor of California, supported furloughs
even after two convicts killed people while on furlough in the
early 1970s. And Reagan raised taxes when he had too, just as he
did as president.
   One of these days _ maybe tomorrow! _ the campaign may focus for
a minute on something like strategic doctrine or Central American
policy or a real war, not a phony war, on drugs. But unless there
is a sudden sea change in the tenor of campaign '88, millions of
registered voters are going to wake up on Nov. 8 scratching their
heads and asking, where do these guys stand?
   ``What are the issues so far,'' wonders a perplexed New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo. ``Pledge of Allegiance, furloughs, death penalty.
Are you kidding?''

<HEAD>Differences Abound: Air Force Two Vs. `Sky Pig'; Airline Vs.
Military Food</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the presidential race were to go to the
candidate with the fastest plane, Republican George Bush would
leave Democrat Michael Dukakis in his jetstream.
   One only need to hear the nickname of the Dukakis plane _ ``Sky
Pig'' _ to get the general idea.
   The name comes partly from the bloated look of the aircraft, a
stubby 20-year-old Boeing 737, but mostly the description is based
on flying time: It takes the plane seven hours to cross the country
_ a 4{-hour flight on most commercial airlines.
   Method of travel is just one of many contrasts of day-to-day
life on the campaign trail for the two men who would be president.
   Because he's the vice president, Bush gets to draw from a fleet
of fast Air Force planes hangared at Andrews Air Force Base near
Washington.
   As any plane the president flies automatically becomes ``Air
Force One,'' whatever plane Bush is on becomes ``Air Force Two.''
Usually a converted Boeing 707 or a McDonnell-Douglas DC-9, Bush's
planes are fast, meticulously cared for and flown by Air Force
pilots.
   Bush's campaign reimburses taxpayers, in part, for the use of
the plane, which is blue and white with the words ``The United
States of America'' emblazoned across the sides.
   Dukakis' plane, chartered from Presidential Airlines, is the
same aircraft that Bush's former rival, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, used.
Designed for short-range flying, ``Sky Pig'' cannot cross the
country without one or more refueling stops.
   That was fine for the kind of campaigning Dole did during the
GOP primaries _ after all, Dole used to joke that he'd fly over a
state and direct the pilot to land wherever he spotted a crowd _
but it poses some scheduling problems in the final weeks of a
national campaign.
   Aides to Dukakis, however, say the candidate is comfortable with
the plane, likes the ``Presidential'' designation on the side in
green letters, and has no plans to trade it in for a sleeker model.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   One reason Dukakis may like the plane is food.
   He has been known to eat with delight meals that aides and
reporters flying with him have pronounced indigestible. The airline
also stocks plenty of raisin bran and milk, the Massachusetts
governor's favorite breakfast.
   Bush, by comparison, smothers nearly everything he eats on the
plane _ ranging from pork rinds and taco salads to tuna fish
sandwiches _ with hot red pepper sauce. But then, the usual
offering on Air Force Two is bland military fare, served by
government employees.
   When possible, Bush treats plane meals as snacks, or skips them
altogether, saving most of his appetite for large meals in
restaurants.
   Bush usually hits a restaurant unannounced, then mingles with
the other patrons for some impromptu campaigning. Dukakis, by
contrast, seldom eats in restaurants while on the campaign trail.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Both candidates travel with an entourage of aides, Secret
Service agents and reporters.
   But Air Force Two has room for only a small ``pool'' of six to
nine representatives of the news media; the rest of the traveling
press corps is put on one, and sometimes two, press planes.
   Dukakis' plane has more seats for members of the news media _
about 30 _ but there is also a backup plane for camera crews and
reporters unable to get seats on ``Sky Pig.''
   For a reporter, the main advantage of riding on Dukakis' backup
plane, a Boeing 727, is that it always gets there first. The main
advantage of riding on Bush's press plane: The food is better.
   Bush frequently comes back and chats with the small group of
reporters on his plane, sometimes inviting them up to his cabin for
drinks and informal chitchat.
   By contrast, Dukakis seldom speaks to the reporters or Secret
Service agents who travel with him.
   However, Dukakis aides are generally more plentiful and more
talkative.

<TEXT>
   Security for both candidates is tight, but Bush's motorcades are
longer. In addition to two bullet-proof black limousines, both
flown in on cargo planes in advance, Bush's motorcades routinely
have five or more vans for staff and special guests.
   By the time Secret Service vehicles and press vans and buses are
added, Bush motorcades can easily stretch for blocks.

<HEAD>Bush Solidifying Lead in South; Holds Edge in Several Midwest
States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush is strengthening his lead over Democrat
Michael Dukakis in the South and holds an edge in several
Midwestern states where the number of undecided voters remains
high, according to statewide polls.
   The largest survey _ a poll of 2,102 registered voters in 15
Southern and border states _ showed Bush leading Dukakis by 12
points _ 49 percent to 37 percent _ with 12 percent undecided.
   The poll, published Sunday by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
had a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.
   In the survey, the Republican presidential nominee led in every
state, including Florida where he held a 26-point advantage and
Texas where Bush enjoys a 14-point lead. Both are key Electoral
College states; Florida has 21 electoral votes, Texas 29.
   According to the poll, Bush leads Dukakis among independent
voters by nearly a 2-1 margin and has the support of 15 percent of
black and Hispanic voters. The poll showed women supporting Bush by
46 percent to 37 percent, and men supporting Bush by 53 percent to
37 percent.
   The states in which the poll was conducted were Alabama,
Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina,
Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.
   Polls in Kansas and Missouri found GOP vice presidential
candidate Dan Quayle a drag on the GOP ticket, with voters in
Missouri giving the Indiana senator the highest unfavorable rating
of anyone on the ballot.
   In the Missouri poll, published by The Kansas City Star, Dukakis
had narrowed Bush's nine-point lead from late August to four
percentage points. Among the 550 likely voters surveyed by
telephone last week, 45 percent favored Bush while 41 percent
preferred Dukakis. Fourteen percent of the voters were undecided.
   The poll, conducted by Market Shares Corp. for The Star, The
Kansas City Times and KCTV, had a margin of error of plus or minus
four percentage points, statistically negating Bush's advantage.
   The poll, conducted before the vice presidential debate between
Quayle and Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, indicated that the Republican is
hurting the GOP ticket. Half of the voters surveyed said Quayle is
not qualified to assume the presidency, if the need arose.
   Quayle also received a 40 percent unfavorable rating compared to
37 percent for Dukakis, 35 percent for Bush and 21 percent for
Bentsen.
   In the Kansas poll of 500 people of voting age, Bush led
Dukakis, 40-31 percent, with 29 percent undecided. The survey,
published Sunday by the Topeka Capital-Journal, had a margin of
error of six points.
   In a poll conducted Aug. 29-Sept. 7, Bush held a slight lead
over Dukakis, 41-38 percent.
   If Bush is gaining in Kansas, the poll suggests that the success
is not due to any help from Quayle.
   Forty-one percent of those surveyed picked Bentsen as better
qualified to assume the presidency while 18 percent said Quayle.
Ten percent said there was no difference and 31 percent had no
opinion.
   In New Mexico, Bush led Dukakis 47.4 percent to 38.9 percent
among 772 likely voters surveyed Oct. 1 through Oct. 6. The
remaining 13.7 percent were undecided.
   The poll, published in the Albuquerque Journal, had a margin of
error of four percentage points.
   A similar survey, conducted Sept. 6 through Sept. 9, showed
Dukakis leading Bush 43-42 percent with 15 percent undecided.
   In Ohio, a poll of 1,571 registered voters found Bush leading
Dukakis 47-43 percent with 10 percent undecided. The survey,
conducted Oct. 1 through Oct. 6 by The Columbus Dispatch, had a
margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
   In a poll the newspaper conducted Sept. 3-8, Bush led Dukakis
48-43 percent.
   Meanwhile, a Harris poll found that Bush's lead in the polls is
based more on preference for him personally than for the policies
of the Republican Party.
   The poll showed that voters who have consistently given Bush an
edge over Dukakis in the polls are evenly split when asked which
party's candidate they would like to see in the presidency, without
being given the candidates' names.
   Forty-seven percent chose the Democratic Party; 47 percent chose
the Republican Party.
   The poll results roughly matched the results of a similar poll
conducted in August, and the results of a similar poll taken at the
same time last year.
   The poll was conducted randomly by telephone among 1,235 voters
nationwide between Sept. 26 and Sept. 29. It had a margin of error
of three percentage points.

   A rusting cylinder of poison has been
destroyed, and the 3,500 residents who were cleared out are home.
But officials say more evacuations can be expected if new hazards
are found at an abandoned chemical plant.
   Residents within 1,000 yards of the plant were told to leave
their homes Sunday while the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
blew up a tank of what it thought was hydrogen cyanide.
   As little as 50 milligrams of the chemical, or less than
one-sixth the weight of the average aspirin tablet, can kill.
   The evacuations took two hours, 2{ hours less than expected.
   ``There is a possibility, almost a certainty, that there will be
future evacuations here,'' said EPA spokesman Harold Yates.
   More than 3,400 drums and barrels _ most unidentified, rusting
or both _ were left behind in this Kanawha River town of 9,000 when
Artel Chemical Co. couldn't pay its workers and a federal judge
ordered the site closed in June.
   With the hydrogen cyanide cylinder blown up, the most pressing
problems now are a 9,000-gallon tank of methyl mercaptan, which is
toxic and highly flammable, and a bunker full of sodium, which
reacts violently upon contact with water.
   There could be surprises, too, as the cleanup continues at the
Superfund site, Yates said.
   ``We have found a number of incompatible materials stored in
close proximity,'' Yates said. ``It's a threat to public health.''
   Sunday's explosion occurred at 1:55 p.m., and a fire was started
to burn off the tank's contents. None of the gas was detected
downwind, but a cyanide monitor held directly over the burning
cylinder read 1 part per million, said Jerry Heston, the EPA's
on-site coordinator.
   ``There was no reason to think it was anything other than
hydrogen cyanide,'' Heston said, but added that more tests will be
done to find out.
   The EPA took over the plant and closed it after the federal
government declared it a threat to public health. Yates said the
cleanup could take years, and Mayor Don Karnes said future
cooperation could be limited.
   ``I'll tell people they should leave if they (the EPA) tell me
to, but I'm not sure they're going to go,'' Karnes said. ``They
made all this fuss about this and then it turned out to be almost
nothing.''
   Elmer Fike, who for 33 years operated Fike Chemical Co. _ now
Artel Chemical Co. _ said venting the poison to the atmosphere over
a 24- to 36-hour period would have eliminated the need to disrupt
so many people.
   ``I've told them other ways to taking care of this,'' Fike said
before the explosion. ``They're blowing this way out of
proportion.''
   But Heson said the EPA believed a controlled explosion of the
tank and its contents was the best solution.
   ``I'm not going to open the valve and see what it is,'' he said.
   The evacuation was scheduled to last from 12:20 p.m. to 5 p.m.
but the detonation went so smoothly that the all clear signal was
given 2{ hours early. Nearly everyone who was asked to leave did,
heading to nearby shopping malls or to relatives' homes rather than
the official evacuation center, where only 26 people went.
   The federal government built the town of Nitro in World War I to
manufacture explosives and munitions. There are now more than two
dozen chemical plants in a 12-mile stretch along the river that's
known as ``Chemical Valley.''

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet-style government is
changing its tactics against Moslem guerrillas in the battle for
power as Moscow's army withdraws.
   The government, dominated by a Communist Party that has been
trying to portray itself as the real defender of the Moslem faith,
is campaigning for international pressure to halt American and
Pakistani support for the guerrillas.
   Both the Soviet Union and the Afghan government have been
maneuvering for a negotiated settlement, rather than a military
showdown, although Moscow continues to arm the Kabul government.
   The guerrillas have also achieved some changes, such as the
ability to move weapons faster from Pakistan to the hills outside
Kabul. But they still lack the coordination for a significant new
strategy,.
   However, some Western diplomats believe the fierce Afghan winter
poses less of an obstacle to the guerrillas' ability to mount
attacks on Kabul than in the past.
   The withdrawal of about 50,000 Soviet soldiers this summer gave
the guerrillas greater control of roads and highways, especially
those leading from their supply bases in Pakistan to Kabul. This
means they are no longer restricted to taking circuitous routes
through mountains where winter snows often block the passes.
   The remaining Soviet soldiers, estimated at 50,000 to 55,000,
are to withdraw by Feb. 15 under an accord signed in Geneva last
April.
   The rebel's ``supply situation has improved vastly,'' a Western
diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``A few years
ago they depended on camels, donkeys and horses. Now they're
depending on Mercedes-Benz trucks.''
   But the real test will be whether the rebels can mount a serious
enough siege of Kabul to curtail the city's fuel and food supplies
this winter.
   Already, sugar has virtually disappeared from the markets in
Kabul in the last week after key highways leading to the capital
were closed by the guerrillas.
   Residents also report a shortage of flour for bread, an Afghan
staple, and say the prices of basic foodstuffs have risen by 20
percent or more in the last two months.
   The April 14 Geneva agreement that provided for the Soviet
withdrawal was signed by the United States, the Soviet Union,
Pakistan and Afghanistan.
   Both Afghanistan and the Soviet Union have increasingly targeted
Pakistan as a violator of the accord in an effort to pressure
Pakistan to force the guerrillas to negotiate. In addition, the
death of Pakistan's President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq in August
deprived the guerrillas of their most ardent suppporter.
   So far, the rebels don't appear willing to negotiate.
   Foreign diplomats estimate the Soviets now have 35,000 men
defending Kabul and an additional 20,000 or more deployed outside
the capital.
   Washington has predicted the Afghan government and its armed
forces will collapse after the Soviets complete their withdrawal.
   The morale of the 40,000-man Afghan army is considered low, but
the army is not the backbone of the government's military strength.
   Its real clout, as one well-regarded Western analyst pointed
out, rests with three other forces that have a total of at least
100,000 men who are highly motivated and equipped with heavy armor,
field guns and aircraft. These are the Sarandoy, a paramilitary
force of 25,000, the 15,000-man secret police force known by the
afghan acronym of KHAD and 60,000 to 70,000 tribal militiamen paid
by Kabul.
   The rebel's strength has been variously estimated at between
40,000 and 200,000, but there is no clear indication how many are
full-time fighters or even inside Afghanistan instead of across the
border in Pakistan.
   More important, the analyst said, is that the biggest band of
guerrillas in any location numbers no more than 100 men and local
commanders have little contact with each other.
   The rank and file of Afghanistan's regular army is generally
regarded as little more than cannon fodder. Foreign diplomats and
Afghans said vacancies caused by desertions and casualties are
filled by forced conscription of draftees as young as 14 and by
giving amnesty to political prisoners and then drafting them.
   As part of the government's attempt at changing its image, this
spring it started allowing the International Committee of the Red
Cross to visit political prisoners and has announced the release of
4,000 such prisoners so far this year.
   ``The belief is that half of them have gone straight into the
army. They're given one day of training and then ... they're put
into the front line,'' the Western analyst said.
   He and other diplomats said boys of 14 and 16 continue to be
rounded up for army duty.

   Israeli troops shot to death three Palestinians
and swept through the occupied territories in search of suspects
during a general strike marking the anniversary of 10 months of
rebellion.
   Also Sunday, underground Palestinian leaders called for world
intervention to stop what they called Israeli repression in the
territories.
   Troops shot and killed two Palestinians in the West Bank on
Sunday during widespread searches for suspected agitators, the
military reported. In the Gaza Strip, a border security guard
killed a man who attacked him with a knife.
   The army said eight other protesters were wounded Sunday, but
Arab hospital officials put the number at 23. The day's violence
increased the casualty toll of the last three days to nine dead and
more than 70 wounded.
   The uprising has taken the lives of 294 Palestinians since it
began in December. Six Israelis have also been killed. The revolt
has become the leading issue in the campaign for Israeli national
elections on Nov. 1.
   The uprising against Israel's rule of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War,
entered its 11th month Sunday. A general strike marking the
anniversary closed stores and paralyzed public transportation.
   A military spokesman said the army changed tactics by going on
the offensive Sunday and entered West Bank towns and villages to
search for suspects and arrest them.
   ``We took initiated action in over 30 villages with the goal of
acting on days, such as strike days and anniversaries,'' said the
spokesman on condition of anonymity.
   Soldiers forced residents to whitewash illegal anti-Israeli
slogans off walls and clear road barriers. Protesters have used the
barriers during their clashes with police.
   In the West Bank village of Yatta, a mob attacked troops with
rocks, and the soldiers opened fire, the spokesman said.
   Two residents were shot, he said. Army helicopters evacuated
them, but they died while receiving medical treatment.
   One was wanted by security forces, the spokesman said, but he
would not give the man's name or what he was suspected of.
   In Gaza, a 20-year-old resident was shot and killed by a
civilian security guard he tried to knife at a border crossing, a
military spokesman said. The victim, a university student in Egypt,
had just returned to Rafah aboard an Egyptian bus with about 10
passengers, and the guard was questioning him, the spokesman said.
   Palestinian sources identified the victim as Osama Ahmed Abu
Dahi, of Rafah.
   A second man was wounded, and Arab sources identified him as
33-year-old Ibrahim Hamdan Abu Fogo, of Rafah. He was in good
condition at Beersheba's Soroka Hospital.
   Israeli radio said the security guard questioned the man after
recognizing him as a suspect wanted by security forces for
anti-Israeli activity.
   ``Our security man did a very good job,'' said Shmuel Shafran,
chief manager in charge of the border post at Rafah. ``Even though
he was injured, he displayed courage and resourcefulness, overcame
the attacker and killed him.''
   The guard and second passenger were only slightly injured, the
army said. The military put a curfew on Rafah, a town of 11,000, to
prevent demonstrations after the killing, the army said.
   In an underground leaflet, uprising leaders called on U.N.
organizations to act against Israel's closure of schools and
universities in the occupied territories.
   Israeli authorities have kept West Bank schools and most Gaza
schools closed this academic year for fear classrooms would be used
as rallying points for riots. The schools were closed most of the
last academic year as well.
   The leaflet called on residents of the territories to organize
sit-in protests outside foreign embassies and U.N. offices to
protest the closures.

<TEXT>
   A scolding may have saved 12-year-old Emily
Litt's life because five classmates she would have been with were
struck and killed by a speeding car that jumped a curb.
   Emily's mother, Pixie, said her daughter was at the home of
13-year-old Jessica McKeefry when Mrs. Litt ordered her daughter
home because ``she called her brother something like a fathead.''
   The other girls were ``just going outside as I was leaving,''
Emily said.
   When she got home, her mother told her she was grounded and
would have to spend the rest of Friday evening with her family. But
she allowed Emily to return Jessica's bicycle, and ``I got there
five seconds after the car hit that tree,'' Emily said.
   The car had already struck and killed Jessica and four other
friends by the time it hit the tree and stopped.
   ``I feel guilty that she was not there _ that I was one of the
lucky parents,'' Mrs. Litt said Sunday. ``I feel terrible for those
families.''
   Officials mustered parents and counselors to help grieving
students as they returned to Glenbrook Elementary School today for
the first time since the accident that stunned this small community
northwest of Green Bay.
   ``We will meet with all of the youngsters in small groups,''
Principal James Brawner said. ``We will have people available (to
help grieving students) ... as long as needed.''
   Besides the five victims, a fifth-grader from the school was a
passenger in the car driven by her brother and was hospitalized
with injuries.
   Neighboring school districts and service centers in Green Bay
offered their counseling staffs to help Pulaski, a rural community
of about 1,900, deal with the tragedy. Parents volunteered their
help as well.
   Brawner said help would also be available for students at other
schools in the district and at Pulaski High School, where the
injured 17-year-old driver and three siblings of the dead
pedestrians are students.
   ``If there's a silver lining to this, it's been very reassuring
to see how the community has reached out to help everyone and the
schools,'' said Brawner.
   Witnesses told authorities the 1975 Cadillac was going about 70
mph a couple of blocks from the police station when the accident
happened.
   Police Chief Reed Woodward said investigators were trying to
determine why the car was traveling so fast. He said they planned
to begin looking today for possible mechanical problems with the
auto.
   Authorities also were investigating the possibility that the
driver, Scott C. Karcz, had suffered a seizure before the crash.
   Karcz, a diabetic, was listed in critical condition at St.
Vincent Hospital in Green Bay, and his 11-year-old sister, Tina,
was listed in serious condition. Woodward said a diabetic seizure
had been ruled out.
   In addition to Jessica, killed were Brenda Hylok, Laura Karcz
and Jodi Prokop, all 13, and Nicole Watia, 12.
   The girls were among the 52 students in the seventh grade at
Glenbrook Elementary School.
   ``It's our smallest class and we just lost one-tenth of it,''
said Brawner, whose son, Charles, is in the class. ``There (are)
going to be several sad days ahead of us.''
   But officials said they also want to try to maintain some
semblance of routine for students.
   Some weekend sports events were canceled, but classes were
scheduled for today and Tuesday, despite Tuesday evening's
community memorial service for the five girls at the high school
gymnasium.

   A man clung to the roof of a car as it
traveled seven miles on a highway after striking his parked car,
leading to the arrest of a hit-and-run driver, police said.
   Michael Fitzgerald, 20, said he was trying to prevent the car's
driver from leaving the scene of an accident.
   ``I bought the car two months ago, and now it's wrecked and the
guy was getting away,'' he said.
   Police said the driver, Brian Scheidter, 18, was charged with
drunken driving, reckless endangerment, reckless driving, leaving
the scene of an accident, hit-and-run driving and underage drinking.
   Fitzgerald said the accident occurred early Sunday as he was
leaving a friend's house. He told police he was walking to his car,
which was parked on the street, and another car hit it just as he
reached it. The driver then began to pull away, he said.
   Fitzgerald said he jumped onto the roof from the rear of the car
and was laying with one hand on each side of the roof as the car
went down several streets onto Interstate 279, also known as the
Parkway.
   Police who spotted Fitzgerald on the roof stopped the car.
   ``It must have been a sight for those people who passed us on
the Parkway,'' Fitzgerald said. ``Now that it's over, I can talk
and laugh about it.''

<DATELINE>DIMONA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir drew cheers
in this working class town by vowing to use more force to quell the
Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories if he is
re-elected next month.
   The 72-year-old leader also said Sunday he would never agree to
an independent Palestinian state, which PLO leaders may declare at
a meeting planned later this month in Tunisia. Shamir said he would
seek other ways of reaching peace with Arab neighbors.
   He told The Associated Press he would propose peace talks with
Arabs on the basis of an autonomy plan outlined in a 1979 peace
treaty with Egypt. Asked why he would pursue the idea despite its
rejection by Palestinians, Shamir replied: ``Whoever wants to
propose something the Arabs will accept, has to say good-bye to the
state of Israel.''
   ``I will initiate and attempt to persuade,'' Arab states to
negotiate by this plan, Shamir said. ``If they say, `no,' outright,
I won't be deterred.''
   Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, spoke after being
flown by army helicopter to Israel's Negev desert, where he
campaigned for five hours in three towns, including Dimona, 50
miles south of Jerusalem.
   Dimona, like many other immigrant towns in Israel, is a Likud
stronghold whose residents are mostly of Sephardi origin. Sephardi
Israelis make up a large percentage of the nation's disadvantaged
and have long enjoyed more political influence in Likud than in the
left-leaning Labor Party.
   Dozens of children waving plastic Israeli flags surrounded
Shamir as he arrived in Dimona. A local official invited him home
for a light dinner of fried sole, eggs and cheese.
   Later at an election rally in a shopping center, Shamir
enthralled some 3,000 supporters with calls for tough treatment of
Arab violence.
   Waving a fist in the air, Shamir unleashed attacks on Labor
Party leader and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, his main rival in
the Nov. 1 parliamentary elections. Shamir warned that Peres'
conciliatory approach to the Arabs ``is liable to bring us the
greatest tragedy.''
   ``If Likud wins, the Arabs will understand, there is no more
hope for an international conference or a Palestinian state,''
Shamir said. ``They'll see they have to hold dialogue with the
Likud and that we are ready for negotiations, without
preconditions.''
   Peres has backed an Arab-supported plan for a conference of
Western countries including the U.S. and Soviet Union who would
mediate a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Shamir opposes
the plan, claiming such a wide forum of nations would put
inordinate pressure on Israel to concede lands captured in the 1967
Middle East War.
   ``Whoever withdraws from Judea, Samaria (biblical names for the
West Bank) and Gaza, opens the door to a Palestinian state,''
Shamir warned.
   A Palestinian state, he said, ``would be a trap. Every country
would come to its aid _ America, the Soviet Union, Europe _ there
would be war forever.''
   Shamir also promised to crush the uprising that has claimed the
lives of more than 290 Palestinians and six Israelis since Dec. 8.
   ``We will use all the means at our disposal, so that the Arabs
will see there is not much point to their war,'' Shamir added
privately, in remarks to reporters.
   The premier also warned supporters against disrupting Labor
party rallies, after two Likud fans nearly broke up three Labor
rallies this week, heckling Peres and calling him a traitor. In one
town, Likud backers sprayed water from hoses at Labor ralliers on
Saturday.
   Labor reportedly planned to protest the violence to the Central
Elections Committee today.
   The election campaign has grown tense largely over charged
emotions generated by the unrest in the disputed territories and
because public opinion polls show both large parties at a virtual
deadlock.
   ``Don't vent your anger so freely,'' Shamir cautioned. ``We must
control ourselves, exercise self-restraint, keep our anger in our
hearts and express it only at the ballot box.''

<HEAD>Government Considers Removing Suspect's Right To Silence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd says Britain needs to
change the law that gives suspects a legal right to remain silent.
   At present, if they stay silent under police questioning this
cannot be held to weigh against them at their trial.
   ``No one can take out the thumbscrews and force reluctant people
to speak,'' Hurd said in an filmed interview for the British
Broadcasting Corp. program ``Panorama.''
   ``The question is to what extent can a court take into account
the fact that someone has been dumb, has not spoken or has spun a
yarn at the last minute, which didn't emerge at the police
station.''
   In the end, he said, ``we will need, I'm quite sure, in England
and Wales, to change the law on the right to silence.''
   The interview was filmed in advance for broadcast tonight but
made available to journalists before screening.
   Cabinet member Hurd's Home Office is the government department
responsible for police and law and order among other matters.
Scotland has its own legal system.
   A year ago, the head of Scotland Yard, Metropolitan Police
Commissioner Peter Imbert, said a suspect's legal right to remain
silent in police custody without this weighing against him or her
at the trial hampered the fight against crime and should be removed.
   Both the judge and prosecution should be able to draw a jury's
attention to a suspect's refusal to answer questions, Imbert told
an internatinal police conference in London.
   ``It's a puzzle to me how a privilege against self-incrimination
ever gained a respectable place in the English legal system. If we
are to deter people from criminal acts, then increasing the
prospects of conviction for them would be a most significant
step,'' Imbert said.
   Civil liberties organizations and some lawyers' groups have
protested that removing the right to silence would cause a
fundamental change in the law to the detriment of defendants.
   At present, the so-called burden of proof at a trial is on the
prosecution. It must show conclusively that an accused person is
guilty before he or she can be convicted. Critics say that if the
right to silence is removed, the burden of proof will be shifted to
the defense to show that an accused person is innocent.

<HEAD>Students Equate High College Tuitions With High Quality</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A poll has found that the ``Chivas Regal
Syndrome,'' the belief that high tuition means superior education,
is widespread among young people, but that nearly half said tuition
costs block many from college.
   A survey of student attitudes marking National Higher Education
Week, Oct. 9-15, found that 38 percent agreed that ``the higher the
tuition costs of a college, the better the quality of education a
student will receive.''
   Among pre-college-age students, the figures were higher: 53
percent of 13-15 year-olds felt that way; 41 percent of 16 and
17-year-olds surveyed agreed. But among current college students
and recent graduates, 27 percent agreed.
   College officials have lately dubbed that belief the ``Chivas
Regal Syndrome,'' after the premium Scotch whisky, as an
explanation for why Ivy League and other expensive colleges
continue to attract so many applicants. Students and parents seem
ready to pay almost any price for what they believe is a quality
education.
   The poll was commissioned by the Council for Advancement and
Support of Education and conducted Aug. 24 to Sept. 7 by the Gallup
Organization. It was based on telephone interviews of persons ages
13-21 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points.
   Asked what they thought was the major reason more students do
not go to college, 48 percent said they thought the reason was that
college is too expensive and they can't afford it.
   Fifty-nine percent of high school juniors and seniors polled
said they or someone in their families had saved for college
education. The rest said they hadn't or didn't know.
   Asked what they'd do if they couldn't afford the college they
wanted, 37 percent said they'd try to get loans, 32 percent would
look for part-time jobs, 14 percent said they would select another
college, and 2 percent said they would not attend college. The rest
weren't sure.
   Other findings:
   _ 54 percent of America's high school juniors and seniors said
they expect to graduate from college; 8 percent plan to graduate
from high school but go no further. The remainder said they plan to
attend vocational or trade school, or go to college but not long
enough to graduate.
   _ 67 percent said that in selecting a college, availability of
particular courses and curriculum was ``extremely important;'' 44
percent cited the school's academic reputation, 45 percent said
college expenses were a crucial factor.
   Only 20 percent cited social life or athletic reputation as
``extremely important.''
   _ Seven of 10 believe public colleges offer as good an education
as private schools, and three out of five felt two-year
institutions are on a par with four-year schools.

   Union leaders at Electric Boat will seek
members' approval of a tentative pact to end a 4-month-old strike
by more than 10,000 workers against the Navy's only maker of
Trident nuclear submarines.
   The company and the Metal Trades Council announced the tentative
settlement Saturday night following four full days of negotiations.
   An eight-hour session ended with union President Joseph W.
Messier and Electric Boat's chief negotiator, Thomas E. Kelly,
jointly announcing the agreement.
   ``We will unanimously endorse this agreement and recommend to
our membership that they ratify it,'' Messier said.
   ``The company is pleased that the long negotiations have come to
an end,'' Kelly said.
   Messier and Kelly refused to answer questions about the details
of the contract, which will be voted upon by union members Tuesday.
   The union initiated the latest round of negotiations following a
series of events that have weakened the union's position, including
a charge by the National Labor Relations Board that the strike was
illegal. The board said the union failed to give federal mediators
a mandatory 30-day notice before walking off the job.
   The company's last known four-year offer included a bonus worth
5 percent of a worker's annual pay in the first year; a 4 percent
bonus in the second year; a 3 percent general wage increase the
third year; and a $600 bonus in the fourth year. The proposal also
included a $1,000 contract ratification bonus.
   The Metal Trades Council, which represents 10 local trades
unions, struck July 1 when Electric Boat proposed a new contract
that included only bonuses and no raises over three years. Workers
rejected the proposal by a 5-3 ratio June 30.
   Electric Boat is the Navy's sole producer of the giant Trident
nuclear submarines and competes annually with the Newport News
(Va.) Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. for contracts to build the
smaller, SSN-688 fast attack subs.

<HEAD>Laos Acknowledges Arresting Two Americans Offering MIA Reward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laos has acknowledged arresting two
Americans who entered the communist country to publicize a reward
to free American war prisoners.
   U.S. officials in Bangkok said the Laotian government has
informed the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane that it had arrested Donna
Long of Jacksonville, N.C., and former Linton, Ind. resident James
Copp, now of Hampstead, N.C.
   It was the first reported acknowledgment by Laos that its forces
had captured the pair.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Ross Petzing said Sunday that Laos had
informed the American Embassy but added that ``we have no further
word regarding this case.''
   Ms. Long and Copp hired a Thai fishing boat, crossed the Mekong
River boundary between Thailand and Laos and were captured Oct. 3
in a Laotian village, according to Thais who were able to visit
them.
   Before setting off, Ms. Long told The Associated Press that they
intended to pass out dollar bills stamped with an offer of $2.4
million to any Laotian, Vietnamese or Cambodian who could produce a
live American being held in Indochina.
   Four American colleagues of Ms. Long and Copp dropped about
$1,000 worth of reward-stamped bills on Friday into the same area
of the Mekong. Much of the money eventually ended up in the hands
of Thai children.
   Meanwhile in the United States, five members of the Copp family
passed out strips of paper Saturday that urged people to call the
Laotian Embassy in Washington, D.C., to inquire about Copp and Ms.
Long.
   The family was in Indianapolis to visit The Moving Wall, a model
of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial that is on traveling exhibit.
   The family said Copp and Ms. Long had the appropriate papers to
visit Thailand but not Laos.
   ``This wasn't a Rambo mission,'' Bill Copp said of his brother's
activities. ``These were civilians and they were handing out the
currency. They were trying to make the government get something
done about the soldiers who may be missing or held prisoner.''
   ``He's not a renegade,'' Sandy Copp said of her brother, who
served in the Army in Vietnam in 1985. ``He just thinks it's about
time for those boys to come home.''
   The U.S. government still lists 2,393 Americans as missing in
action in the three Indochinese countries after the Vietnam War
ended in 1975, but no solid evidence has emerged that any are still
alive.
   The reward is being offered by 21 U.S. congressmen and private
American citizens.
   The six Americans in Southeast Asia seeking information on MIAs
are members of the National Steering Committee for American War
Veterans, a private lobbying group.

   Suspected Tamil guerrillas hacked and
shot to death at least 44 Sinhalese villagers in northern Sri
Lanka, the military said Monday.
   Four others were seriously injured, said officials at the Joint
Operations Command in Colombo.
   The victims, which included 13 women and 18 children, were
fatally shot or hacked to death with knives, officials said.
   About 40 Tamil militants were responsible for the massacre,
which took place in the village of Ulukulama, about 150 miles
northeast of Colombo, the capital, officials said.
   ``The killing occurred late Sunday night. Many villagers fled
their homes,'' said one military official, who cannot be identified
under briefing rules.
   Military officials said they suspected the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Ealam, the most powerful of the rebel groups fighting since
1983 for an independent nation for Tamils.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of the island's 16 million people.
   The Tamils, mostly Hindu, say they are oppressed by the
predominantly-Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the
island's population and control the government and military. They
want a separate homeland in the northeastern province, where they
are a majority.
   A semi-autonomous provincial council is to be elected later to
allow Tamils to take over administrative duties in the province.
   Two militant Tamil groups have submitted a list of candidates
despite threats by the Tigers, who oppose the election.
   Nominations for candidates close Monday.

<HEAD>Extreme Rightists Toning Down Activities Due To Emperor's Illness</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Japan-Emperor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Extreme right-wing groups have been turning down
the volume of loudspeakers used to amplify streetcorner speeches
out of deference to the ailing emperor, Tokyo police said today.
   ``It's been very quiet lately,'' said an officer with the
Metropolitan Police Department. ``The rightists seem to be showing
self-restraint as the emperor is ill.''
   Emperor Hirohito, 87, the world's oldest reigning monarch, has
been bedridden since he vomited blood Sept. 19.
   Right-wing groups in Japan are notorious for driving through
major cities in convoys of military-style jeeps and trucks, blaring
recorded marching music and anti-communist slogans from public
address systems.
   Among the goals of many extreme rightists are revising Japan's
constitution to allow the re-militarization of the country and
reinstating the emperor's prewar status as a god-like soveriegn.
   ``Lately we have been quieter in our daily campaigning because
the emperor is ill,'' said a member of the extreme rightist Great
Japan Patriots Party. ``We've turned down the volume of our
speakers, but our leader continues to make his daily speeches.''
   She refused to divulge her name or the membership of the party,
estimated to be as high as 5,000, but said the group has been
praying daily for the recovery of the emperor.
   The Metropolitan Police officer, who requested anonymity, added
that a national meeting of the left-leaning Japan Teacher's Union
Sunday opened peacefully, with rightists quietly passing out
handbills. The meeting is scheduled to continue through Wednesday.
   ``The union's meetings are usually a target for rightist
groups,'' he said, ``but there has been little trouble.'' The
officer said 34 rightists demonstrated Sunday, and only 40 police
were mobilized. No rightists were reported protesting today.
   He said that at the union's general meeting in Tokyo last year
nearly 2,000 rightists in 400 cars and trucks turned out in
protest, and 1,800 riot police were dispatched to keep the peace.

<HEAD>Voters In Three States Consider Abortion Ballot Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While anti-abortion activists assaulted
clinics during last week's ``siege of Atlanta,'' a lower-key though
no less intense battle raged in Michigan over a ballot measure
aimed at outlawing tax-financed abortions for the poor.
   The referendum in Michigan, one of three states with
abortion-related questions on November's ballot, is being closely
watched because so much money is being spent _ more than $3 million
budgeted by both sides.
   Abortion foes here have passed out Lifesavers candies in hopes
of mobilizing the like-minded without offending anyone else.
   The pro-choice side is considered the underdog, out-financed and
out-organized by the anti-abortion forces.
   ``Michigan is certainly the bellwether state _ there's no
question about it,'' said Dr. John Willke, president of National
Right to Life. ``But I'm not going to predict any of this. I don't
know who's going to win.''
   In Arkansas, where officials say no state funds are used to pay
for abortions, voters nonetheless are being asked to enshrine the
no-abortion spending policy in the state Constitution and to
declare ``the policy of the state of Arkansas is to protect the
life of every unborn child from conception until birth.''
   Jerry Cox, executive director of the Unborn Child Amendment
Committee, said a victory at the polls would put Arkansas in
position to outlaw all abortions if the U.S. Supreme Court ever
modifies Roe vs. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision legalizing
abortion.
   In Colorado, pro-choice forces are trying to repeal a
constitutional amendment similar to Arkansas'. Since 1984, Medicaid
abortion spending has been prohibited except in extreme situations.
   Campaign officials estimate total spending on the ballot
question could reach $1 million.
   ``The current prohibition against public funding is extreme,
it's unfair and it's expensive,'' said Ed Zorensky of Colorado
Taxpayers for Choice.
   According to the state Office of Budget and Planning, it would
cost four times as much in welfare costs to force unwilling women
to bear unwanted children and support them on welfare than to
provide public funding for abortion.
   Pro-choice activists there believe they lost the 1984 campaign
because the ballot wording confused voters.
   ``Colorado is a very strong pro-choice state. If we get the
message out I think we'll win,'' Zorensky said.
   The campaign is hottest in Michigan, where attention has
centered on the impact of the Committee to End Tax-Funded
Abortions' ``not with my money you don't'' advertisements.
   ``I worry about the tremendous amount of resources the other
side is putting into misleading media,'' said Debra Ness, who
tracks the state ballot campaigns for the National Abortion Rights
Action League. ``Unless we have the resources to counter those
messages it's not a fair test of the question of choice.''
   The message from the Committee to End Tax-Funded Abortions
deliberately is not about choice.
   Its commercials, put together by the agency handling George
Bush's presidential campaign advertising, feature well-dressed
people talking in a nice restaurant about how they're going to vote.
   The ads make a distinction between the issue of abortion and the
issue on the ballot.
   ``The way that it's framed is very, very clever,'' Ness said.
``Money buys sophistication. The anti's are trying to make their
stand in Michigan.''
   The state League of Women Voters, which won't choose sides
between political candidates, is working with the pro-choice
coalition and has lambasted the anti-abortion campaign, claiming it
is disguising its long-term goals behind the ads.
   The People's Campaign for Choice, a coalition of women's,
religious and labor groups that's fighting to defeat Michigan's
Proposal A, says $6 million a year in welfare abortion spending is
not the only thing at stake in the campaign.
   The group contends that if voters strip the poor of the right to
a state-paid abortion, it will give momentum to those seeking to
end all abortions.
   In Atlanta, more than 450 people were arrested last week in four
days of protests dubbed the ``siege of Atlanta'' by Operation
Rescue, the New York-based anti-abortion group that staged the
demonstrations.

<HEAD>Pinochet Again Rules Out Opposition Demands For Him To Step Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet acknowledged
defeat in a referendum on extending his rule but again rejected
opposition demands for his resignation and vowed to stay in power
for another 18 months.
   A key opposition leader, meanwhile, was quoted Sunday as calling
for talks with the military government on the nation's political
future.
   In a surprise television appearance from his country home at
Bucalemu, Gen. Pinochet said Sunday, ``I acknowledge the
opposition's victory, but I am not going to change what the
constitution says. March 11, 1990, is going to be the day that the
government is handed over.
   ``The situation is very simple,'' he said. ``We fulfilled the
constitution that was set up ... so now that the opposition has
triumphed, why should we change?''
   The comments of the 72-year-old commander-in-chief of Chile's
armed forces came during a three-minute TV newscast. Pinochet was
dressed in a short-sleeve blue shirt. He appeared relaxed and spoke
clearly and firmly.
   Nearly 7 million Chileans went to the polls Wednesday to vote on
the armed forces' proposal that Pinochet remain president until
1997. Pinochet, who ousted elected Marxist President Salvador
Allende in a 1973 coup that left Allende dead, lost by about
800,000 votes or a margin of more than 11 percent.
   The vote was carried out under a 1980 constitution. That
document also calls for elections for president and congress to be
held in December 1989, with the winners taking office in March.
   Opposition leaders have pressed Pinochet's military government
to move up the date of elections and make other constitutional
changes.
   Their proposals include eliminating a constitutional ban on
Marxist groups, and allowing the entire Senate _ not just
two-thirds _ to be elected rather than appointed.
   Opposition leaders also want to streamline the process by which
future constitutional changes can be made.
   ``We will formally call on those holding power now to talk to
reach an agreement,'' opposition spokesman Patricio Aylwin said in
an interview published Sunday in the newspaper La Epoca. ``We will
take the initiative by making a proposal and call to the armed
forces.''
   Aylwin is spokesman for the 16-party coalition that urged
Chileans to vote ``no'' in the referendum.
   A 4-man military junta acts as the legislature of this South
America country, which has been ruled by freely elected, democratic
governments for most of its 178-year history as an independent
nation.
   The junta is empowered to change the constitution, but Pinochet
said in a speech broadcast nationwide the night after the
referendum that he had no intention of doing so.
   Ricardo Lagos, a prominent, moderate Socialist, acknowleged that
negotiations, if they take place, would take time. ``The people are
mature enough to understand that 15 years of dictatorship don't end
in 15 hours.''
   But other Pinochet opponents already have served notice they
don't intend to wait long or peacefully. On Saturday, a coalition
of leftist parties publicly called for Pinochet's immediate
resignation.
   The situation sets up potential clashes between the government
and its opponents. In the two days following the election, tens of
thousands of Chileans celebrated Pinochet's defeat with spontaneous
demonstrations in the streets of the capital and other major cities.
   On Friday, an estimated 350,000 Chileans gathered in a downtown
park in a rally organized by the opposition.
   Hundreds of youths have clashed with riot police since the
referendum, leading to two shooting deaths, as well as dozens of
injuries and arrests.
   About 20 reporters and photographers suffered minor injuries
last week when they were attacked by riot police as they covered
opposition celebrations.
   On Sunday, two national policemen guarding the U.S. Consulate
fired on two unidentified gunmen who shot at them from a parked
car, the state Orbe news agency said. No injuries were reported.

<TEXT>
   Yoko Ono and her son will spend most of the next
few years in Europe partly out of fear that a recent, unauthorized
biography of her slain husband could set off a violent reaction,
the New York Post reported today.
   Her husband's assassin, Mark David Chapman, said he had decided
to kill John Lennon in 1980 after reading an article about the
former Beatle in a magazine, Ono said.
   ``The Esquire Magazine article in 1980 was a nasty one,'' she
said before leaving for Switzerland. ``We laughed it off at the
time, but 45 days later, John was killed.''
   ``Some people, such as Chapman, took it seriously, and he said
in public that it actually made him do it,'' she said.
   Ono said she does not think ``The Lives of John Lennon'' by
Albert Goldman should be taken seriously ``at all,'' and called the
book a ``vicious, inaccurate character assassination.'' But, she
added, some people might.
   Ono said her wish to spend more time in Europe also stems from
wanting her son, Sean Lennon, to go to school overseas. Sean, 13,
attends a boarding school in Switzerland.
   ``I certainly have no reason to want to move out of New York,''
she told the Post, ``but because Sean is in Switzerland for a few
years, it opened up the opportunity for me to travel.''
   Ono said her home remains in New York and that she and Sean will
return here often.

<HEAD>One Of World's Earliest Feature Films Found In New Zealand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the world's earliest
feature films, a French production that was thought lost forever,
has turned up intact in New Zealand, a news report said today.
   New Zealand Press Association said an 1896 production by French
film maker Georges Melies, rescued and restored by the New Zealand
film archive, has been identified as the earliest of almost 100
missing Melies films.
   Jonathan Dennis, director of the film archive, said the
discovery of ``Le Manoir Du Diable'' was a major event in world
film archaeology.
   He said the archive's search for rare New Zealand films
constantly turned up prints of foreign films that in many cases
were the only surviving copies of these films.
   ``Last year, we sent back to the United States 39 crates of rare
films, about 250,000 feet in all, representing films made there
between 1898 and 1948, and most of it pre-1910.
   ``All of this was film that did not exist elsewhere and was
thought to have been lost forever,'' he said. ``Melies was the
first great master of the cinema. He demonstrated the art and
potential of the cinema with some classic fantasies and cinema
magic at a time when other film-makers were merely recording trains
arriving at a station.''
   He said the print of ``Le Manoir Du Diable'' was worn but intact
and that a restored copy of the film was taken to Paris and shown
to Madeleine Mathete-Melies, the film maker's grand-daughter.
   ``She identified it and identified her grandfather in the
film,'' Dennis said.

   A former top city official's indictment for
allegedly patronizing a bordello with girls as young as age 14
pulled the covers from liaisons between wealthy, powerful men and
young, drug-taking runaways.
   Roger Boas, a 67-year-old car dealer prominent in local politics
for nearly 30 years, was one of 14 people indicted a week ago today.
   He is accused of visiting the bordello during a 2{-year period
that included part of his decadelong tenure as the city's chief
administrative officer and his unsuccessful mayoral campaign.
   The bordello, in a nondescript, two-story building in a mixed
residential-commercial neighborhood, housed part of a prostitution
ring that served customers in three states, and earned $20,000 a
week, authorities said.
   The grand jury indictment, issued after a 16-month
investigation, contains 86 criminal counts against defendants
including a city police officer and a locally prominent jeweler.
Eight of those charged were alleged patrons of the flourishing
sex-for-pay operation. The others were charged with various counts
of pimping and pandering.
   Authorities reportedly learned of the ring in May 1987 through
an anonymous tip. When authorities failed to follow up, the tipster
tried again two months later, accusing police of failing to
investigate because officers were among the patrons.
   Vice officers put the building under surveillance in September.
Five months later, the operation was shut down.
   Although up to eight officers were under investigation by the
prosecutor's office, police officials have consistently denied
allegations that policemen were protecting the operation.
   A grand jury began hearing evidence in the case in June,
including testimony from several girls who worked at the bordello,
said John Carbone Jr., assistant district attorney in charge of
special prosecutions.
   Some defense attorneys complain their clients are being
victimized by an investigation targeted to get Boas.
   District Attorney Arlo Smith denied that.
   ``I don't care who's involved,'' said Smith. ``If we don't
prosecute the case, I think it would be a scandal for the city. ...
Just because you've been a prominent candidate doesn't give you
immunity from your own behavior.''
   Boas, who has been married 30 years, has four children and won
the Silver and Bronze stars in World War II, has been identified by
five underage prostitutes as the regular client they knew as
``George,'' authorities said. He faces 19 counts of unlawful sex
with a minor stemming from visits between November 1985 and last
May.
   Boas, released on $5,000 bail last week after surrendering, said
he would address the charges ``in the proper manner,'' but added:
   ``For my family's sake and for the sake of the many friends I
have in San Francisco I am truly saddened that someone in the
criminal justice system tried to convict me in the media using
leaks, rumors and innuendo _ in advance of the legal process.''
   After the indictments came out, the San Francisco Chronicle
published a lengthy profile of ``Darlene,'' a 15-year-old former
prostitute who said she earned $600 a day at the bordello. She
reportedly became a key witness in the investigation.
   A child victim of sexual abuse, the girl said she used to act
young and innocent and would sometimes dress up as a schoolgirl to
please customers, who according to authorities were from San
Francisco, Los Angeles, Idaho and Washington state.
   The girl said she and other young prostitutes would sit around
watching soap operas between appointments, stirring cocaine into
their coffee and smoking marijuana. Customers were offered a mint
as they left, she said.
   Smith dismissed as ``absurd'' speculation his office leaked
information before the indictments were announced.
   Patrick J. Roberts, 40, accused of owning the bordello, faces
more than two dozen criminal counts, including felony charges of
pimping, pandering and forcible rape of a 14-year-old. He is in
custody on $500,000 bail.
   Roberts recruited girls by cruising Polk Street in a white
Rolls-Royce, authorities said.
   Polk Street, one of the city's best-known sex-for-hire
districts, is noted for the young prostitutes, many of them
homeless runaways, who line its sidewalks at all hours.

   The nation's tourism industry stands to
lose more than $100 million without emergency repairs to the damage
Hurricane Gilbert did to the island's reputation as a tourist
mecca, officials said.
   They expressed their worries last weekend after Prime Minister
Edward Seaga announced Friday that his government is preparing a
huge advertising campaign to convince foreign tourists that Jamaica
is ready to welcome them again.
   Government officials acknowledge that the storm, the most
intense on record, devastated much of this Caribbean island nation
when it barreled through on Sept. 12. They say tons of food,
medicine and other supplies are pouring in but much more is needed
to feed and shelter tens of thousands left homeless by the storm.
   ``The aid is reaching the people, the problem is the magnitude
of their need,'' said an official close to Seaga. ``It's like an
endless pit, the suffering of the people is greater than the amount
of aid available.''
   But damage to Jamaica's tourist areas was limited, officials
said.
   Peter Rousseau, president of the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist
Association, said the country suffered more damage to its
reputation as a tourist haven than it did to its facilities.
   ``It's only about seven properties that have been damaged,'' he
said. ``What has been hurt is the perception of Jamaica.''
   He said the island must counter its new reputation as a disaster
area, turn the overall tourist trade back on and attract as much of
the vital U.S. Midwest market as possible.
   Association members have prepared their own advertising blitzes
and promotions abroad.
   Hugh Hart, minister of Mining, Energy and Tourism, said Gilbert
wreaked havoc over the island and parts of the economy were badly
damaged. But he said some industries, including tourism, suffered
only slight damage.
   The tourist industry sustained about $45 million damage to hotel
roofs and windows, but 85 percent of hotels are back in operation,
the Jamaica Tourism Board reported. It said business could return
to normal by the end of the month.
   However, tourism officials said the industry could lose up to
$130 million without quick action.
   ``Right after Gilbert, we had more cancellations than we wanted
and not as many bookings,'' Hart said. ``Now, it's started to level
off and things seem to be going the other way.''
   Jamaica earned $600 million from stopover visitors in 1987, and
it was expected to earn about the same this year. However, Gilbert
forced a reduction in the target figure of 170,000 visitors for the
last four months of 1988.
   Seaga told Parliament that Gilbert caused $818 million to $1
billion damage in Jamaica, far less than the $8 billion he
estimated earlier. The latest government damage report said the
storm killed 45 people, severely damaged or destroyed half the
country's homes, and caused $200 million in damage to banana,
coconut, coffee and other crops.
   A team from Toronto is heading to Jamaica this week to check
reports that vast amounts of aid supplies are not getting to the
people who need them.
   Paul Kafele, executive director of the Jamaican Canadian
Association which is sending the team, said his group has heard
rumors that ``supplies aren't reaching their rightful
destinations.''
   ``Because things are so chaotic, a dog-eat-dog mentality has set
in,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Col. Franklin Thompson, director of the Kingston
chapter of the Salvation Army, said 300,000 pounds of food and
medical supplies donated by New York's West Indian population was
stranded at Kennedy International Airport for lack of
transportation.

   Police Superintendent Joseph A. Walsh
was The Law in this tough town, but after nearly half a century
with the department, he's called it quits to his legendary battles
with crooks and lawmen.
   Walsh, who retired Thursday, fended off attempts by several
mayors and police boards to wrest away control of the Police
Department during his 27 years at the helm. And he walked away
unscathed from efforts to link him to organized crime and bribery.
   Some enemies regarded the man known as ``the boss,'' ``jaws''
and ``the super'' as the city's own J. Edgar Hoover, claiming he
kept files on power brokers to insure he maintained his grip on the
department. But colleagues on the force, like Lt. Roger Falcone,
head of special services, considered him a ``cop's cop.''
   ``Joe Walsh's greatest attribute was that he was a human
being,'' said attorney Joseph Mirsky, a close friend. ``You either
loved him or hated him. There was no in between.''
   Walsh, a Bridgeport native who joined the force in 1941 as a
$30-a-week patrolman and continued to go out on drug raids in his
final years, dismissed his critics and defended his tenacious grip
on the department in an interview.
   ``I was a rough cop,'' he said. ``I fought with everybody. I
always thought a police department should be run by a policeman.''
   He also defended Bridgeport, an aging, industrial city that is
the state's largest, and said its reputation as a center for crime
and drugs is undeserved.
   ``That's a hysteria all over the country. It's not confined to
Bridgeport,'' he said.
   Walsh, 72, scored his biggest victory when he turned the tables
on an FBI attempt to entice him to accept a $30,000 bribe in 1981.
   He had been identified as the target of a grand jury
investigation into the Police Department that year when the FBI
sent Tommy Marra Jr., a convicted car thief whose family had known
Walsh for decades, to meet him and offer the bribe wearing a
concealed microphone.
   But Marra allegedly tipped the chief, who showed up at the
meeting wearing his own concealed microphone. When Marra handed
over a $5,000 installment on the bribe, Walsh arrested him. Marra
is now serving a 65-year sentence for kidnapping a former associate.
   ``Walsh owned the town and whatever he wanted to do he did,''
said Richard Gregorie, who was then attorney in charge of the
Organized Crime Strike Force in Connecticut and now a U.S. attorney
in Florida.
   ``There were a number of allegations regarding organized crime
connections with the chief of police.''
   Walsh dismissed the allegations and said the ``sting'' was the
work of overzealous prosecutors.
   ``Everyone knows I'm honest. When I was a detective captain, I
bought my clothes at the pawn shop, that's how honest I was,'' he
said.
   Former Mayor Leonard Paoletta tried unsuccessfully to remove
Walsh from 1983 to 1985 for what he claimed was poor leadership. He
said Walsh made himself virtually untouchable by keeping files on
politicians.
   ``He is known to have what I think of as insurance policies on
many individuals, skeletons in their closets,'' Paoletta said.
   ``Everyone was concerned about those things going public so they
backed off, tucking their tail between their legs and going home.''
   Walsh scoffed at that: ``I never had a file. I knew a lot of
people and if they violated a law, they would have been locked up.''
   Earlier this month, in Walsh's last battle in office, current
Mayor Thomas W. Bucci stripped him of his power to authorize
overtime, turning it over to the police board, because of a city
fiscal crisis. Walsh responded by halting foot patrols in four
high-crime areas, but to no avail. Bucci ordered Walsh to restore
the details without giving back his overtime authority.
   Bucci said he has ``the greatest respect'' for Walsh and didn't
pressure him to retire. But some colleagues who spoke on condition
of anonymity said Walsh, who suffered pneumonia earlier this year
and whose wife, Christine, has had two strokes recently, had lost
the taste for fights.
   Walsh said he retired to spend more time with his wife, three
children and eight grandchildren.
   ``I've been on the job for 47 years and I feel guilty I've been
away from my wife to play cops and robbers while she raised our
family,'' he said.

   Police Superintendent Joseph A. Walsh
was The Law in this tough town, but after nearly half a century
with the department, he's called it quits to his legendary battles
with crooks and lawmen.
   Walsh, who retired Thursday, fended off attempts by several
mayors and police boards to wrest away control of the Police
Department during his 27 years at the helm. And he walked away
unscathed from efforts to link him to organized crime and bribery.
   Some enemies regarded the man known as ``the boss,'' ``jaws''
and ``the super'' as the city's own J. Edgar Hoover, claiming he
kept files on power brokers to insure he maintained his grip on the
department. But colleagues on the force, like Lt. Roger Falcone,
head of special services, considered him a ``cop's cop.''
   ``Joe Walsh's greatest attribute was that he was a human
being,'' said attorney Joseph Mirsky, a close friend. ``You either
loved him or hated him. There was no in between.''
   Walsh, a Bridgeport native who joined the force in 1941 as a
$30-a-week patrolman and continued to go out on drug raids in his
final years, dismissed his critics and defended his tenacious grip
on the department in an interview.
   ``I was a rough cop,'' he said. ``I fought with everybody. I
always thought a police department should be run by a policeman.''
   He also defended Bridgeport, an aging, industrial city that is
the state's largest, and said its reputation as a center for crime
and drugs is undeserved.
   ``That's a hysteria all over the country. It's not confined to
Bridgeport,'' he said.
   Walsh, 72, scored his biggest victory when he turned the tables
on an FBI attempt to entice him to accept a $30,000 bribe in 1981.
   He had been identified as the target of a grand jury
investigation into the Police Department that year when the FBI
sent Tommy Marra Jr., a convicted car thief whose family had known
Walsh for decades, to meet him and offer the bribe wearing a
concealed microphone.
   But Marra allegedly tipped the chief, who showed up at the
meeting wearing his own concealed microphone. When Marra handed
over a $5,000 installment on the bribe, Walsh arrested him. Marra
is now serving a 65-year sentence for kidnapping a former associate.
   ``Walsh owned the town and whatever he wanted to do he did,''
said Richard Gregorie, who was then attorney in charge of the
Organized Crime Strike Force in Connecticut and now a U.S. attorney
in Florida.
   ``There were a number of allegations regarding organized crime
connections with the chief of police.''
   Walsh dismissed the allegations and said the ``sting'' was the
work of overzealous prosecutors.
   ``Everyone knows I'm honest. When I was a detective captain, I
bought my clothes at the pawn shop, that's how honest I was,'' he
said.
   Former Mayor Leonard Paoletta tried unsuccessfully to remove
Walsh from 1983 to 1985 for what he claimed was poor leadership. He
said Walsh made himself virtually untouchable by keeping files on
politicians.
   ``He is known to have what I think of as insurance policies on
many individuals, skeletons in their closets,'' Paoletta said.
   ``Everyone was concerned about those things going public so they
backed off, tucking their tail between their legs and going home.''
   Walsh scoffed at that: ``I never had a file. I knew a lot of
people and if they violated a law, they would have been locked up.''
   Earlier this month, in Walsh's last battle in office, current
Mayor Thomas W. Bucci stripped him of his power to authorize
overtime, turning it over to the police board, because of a city
fiscal crisis. Walsh responded by halting foot patrols in four
high-crime areas, but to no avail. Bucci ordered Walsh to restore
the details without giving back his overtime authority.
   Bucci said he has ``the greatest respect'' for Walsh and didn't
pressure him to retire. But some colleagues who spoke on condition
of anonymity said Walsh, who suffered pneumonia earlier this year
and whose wife, Christine, has had two strokes recently, had lost
the taste for fights.
   Walsh said he retired to spend more time with his wife, three
children and eight grandchildren.
   ``I've been on the job for 47 years and I feel guilty I've been
away from my wife to play cops and robbers while she raised our
family,'' he said.

   Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan rejected a
grand jury's conclusion that a black teen-ager fabricated her story
about being raped by six white men and has vowed vengeance.
   ``You raped my daughter and I will kill you and dismember your
body and feed it to the fowl of the air,'' the black Muslim
minister declared Sunday before an audience of 10,000 people at the
religious sect's annual meeting.
   As Farrakhan spoke about Tawana Brawley, he held and patted the
16-year-old girl's hand.
   ``They would have us believe she did this to herself,''
Farrakhan said.
   ``They tell us she took dog excrement _ a girl of her
intelligence _ and wiped dog excrement on her and got into a
plastic bag. That she scrawled KKK on her chest and `nigger' on her
body and faked the condition she was in after the brutal beasts
took her into their hands.''
   Farrakhan referred to Miss Brawley as a ``mighty, young
warrior'' and said she had asked him to give her a Muslim name.
   She arrived Friday for the group's annual meeting and told a
news conference Saturday she stood by her story and had ``evidence
to back it up.''
   On Thursday, a New York grand jury issued a 170-page report,
based on a seven-month investigation, saying it had found no
evidence that Miss Brawley had been sexually assaulted.
   The panel contended the teen-ager herself was responsible for
the condition in which she was found after a four-day disappearance
last November in Wappingers Falls, N.Y., 75 miles north of New York
City.
   Miss Brawley was found Nov. 28, seemingly dazed, outside an
apartment that had recently been vacated by her family in
Wappingers Falls. Her body was smeared with dog feces and marked
with racial slurs.
   She claimed she had been held captive for four days and raped by
several white men, including one who carried a police-type badge,
and she implicated several law enforcement officials in the attack.
   But Miss Brawley and her mother, Glenda, refused to cooperate
with the grand jury investigation on the recommendation of their
advisers, who had accused authorities of a racially motivated
cover-up.
   Miss Brawley was accompanied to Chicago by her mother, and
family advisers, the Rev. Al Sharpton, and lawyers C. Vernon Mason
and Alton Maddox Jr.
   Before the speech, Maddox announced that he, Mason and Sharpton
would donate $1,000 to the Nation of Islam.
   Farrakhan called Sharpton ``the baddest black brother on the
East Coast and on the West Coast.''
   Farrakhan has steadfastly supported Brawley, and Sharpton called
him the ``only credible national leader left in black America.''

   A University of Colorado engineering
student was arrested after campus police discovered two sticks of
dynamite and other explosives in his dormitory room, authorities
said.
   Mark Gregory Borchelt, 19, of Evergreen, was arrested Sunday for
investigation of felony possession of explosives charges, said
Pauline Coker, a university spokeswoman.
   About 260 students were evacuated from Andrews Hall on Sunday
after police received an anonymous tip alleging explosives were in
Borchelt's third-floor room, Coker said.
   With help from the Boulder Police Department and the Boulder
County Sheriff's Department, campus police confiscated two sticks
of dynamite, two bottle rockets, six jars of suspected explosive
powder, two bottles of flash powder, 10 6-inch lengths of dynamite
fuse and a commercial pull-fuse igniter, officials said. The
materials were in a metal ammunition box.
   Coker said one investigator described the material as
``extremely, extremely dangerous.''

<HEAD>Admiral Byrd's Son Was Mistaken For A Vagrant Before His Body Was
Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A warehouse custodian says a few days before he
found the body of polar explorer Richard E. Byrd's son, he ran him
off the property because he thought he was a drifter.
   Police said Richard E. Byrd Jr.'s body was found last week in
the debris-strewn warehouse. The body was clad in workman's clothes
and one shoe, although Byrd had left Boston by train wearing a tan
shirt and brown pants for a National Geographic Society ceremony in
Washington, D.C., honoring his father.
   Burt W. Gayleard, the on-site manager for Time Realty, which
owns the warehouse, said he spotted Byrd and an unidentified man
Sept. 27.
   ``The first time I came across him, he said, `Somebody take me
to Baltimore. I want to go to Baltimore','' Gayleard recalled. ``He
was trying to sleep when I found him. He didn't have any teeth and
he spoke like a vagrant, but he pronounced `Baltimore' properly,
not like someone who lived here.''
   Byrd, 68, left Boston on Sept. 13 to attend the ceremony
honoring his father.He never arrived and his whereabouts remained a
mystery for three weeks.
   ``I put him on a train and my wife was supposed to meet him,''
said his son, Leverett Byrd of Needham, Mass. ``What happened in
between, I don't know. It's very strange, this whole thing. We're
trying to come to grips with it.''
   Byrd said his father had suffered from some memory loss, but
hadn't wandered before.
   Police identified Byrd through a Boston Transit Authority
identification card pinned to his undershorts.
   Byrd's family has asked Arlington National Cemetery officials
outside Washington for permission to bury him there, Byrd's sister,
Katharine Breyer, said Sunday.
   Baltimore police spokesman Dennis Hill said Sunday that
investigators were waiting for results from toxicology tests that
might shed light on the cause of death.
   Although Byrd appeared to be suffering from malnutrition and
dehydration, a cause of death remained undetermined.
   Byrd was 6 years old when his father, Adm. Richard Evelyn Byrd,
reached the North Pole, and in the 1940s, joined the admiral on an
expedition to the South Pole.
   Leverett Byrd said his father, who lived off small trust funds
and stock market investments, had a hard time being the son of a
famous figure.
   ``His whole life was pretty difficult. You can imagine what it
was like to be the son of Admiral Byrd.''

   The Federal Trade Commission is interviewing
hundreds of Florida doctors and demanding minutes from medical
societies' meetings in an investigation of emergency room boycotts
last year, a newspaper reported.
   ``I don't see any smoking guns,'' said John Thrasher, general
counsel for the Florida Medical Association. ``My guess is had they
had something, it would have developed by now and something would
have been done about it.''
   The FTC is questioning doctors to determine if they acted as
individuals or as a group when they began refusing emergency calls
in response to a 33 percent to 42 percent hike in insurance
premiums, The Miami Herald reported Sunday.
   Federal antitrust laws prohibit businesses from acting together
for financial gain.
   ``We're intimidated,'' said Dr. Charles Lipman, a thoracic
surgeon in North Miami Beach. ``It's kind of like you're up against
the big boys and that's scary.''
   The FTC won't discuss the growing investigation, but Lipman and
Dade County hospital officials said hundreds of doctors have been
questioned, either voluntarily or after being subpoenaed.
   Some doctors who canceled their insurance saw eliminating
emergency room work as a way to reduce the risk of being sued.
Their actions captured the attention of politicians who promised to
do something about the cost of malpractice insurance in Florida.
   Last spring, the Legislature passed a law making it harder to
gain damages in lawsuits from doctors who deliver babies and work
in emergency rooms. Injured people must now prove the doctor showed
reckless disregard for their care, and all lawsuits involving
brain-damaged babies are handled by a state compensation system
instead of the courts.
   The changes stabilized insurance premiums and brought some
doctors back to emergency rooms.
   But many more are refusing to return unless Florida voters
approve Amendment 10 on the November ballot. The law would ease
their malpractice insurance burden by capping non-economic damages
or those a jury would give for pain and suffering at $100,000.
   The FTC began last year to investigate whether doctors were
legally trying to change the state malpractice law, or illegally
trying to pad their wallets.
   The agency has forced some medical societies to hand over
minutes from meetings and all written communication between its
members. That includes identical letters the Palm Beach
obstetricians sent to hospitals announcing the boycott.
   FTC spokeswoman Dee Ellison said the agency will try to make
doctors found to have violated antitrust laws to agree to stop
refusing emergency room care. If an agreement can't be reached, the
agency can bring the doctors to trial and impose civil penalties of
fines or community service, if it wins.

   About 100 homosexual couples exchanged vows
on the steps of City Hall, kissed in a shower of rice and appealed
for legal recognition of their relationships.
   ``Maybe this will lead to the day we can have our families,
parents and friends at our weddings, not just our funerals,'' Pat
Norman, a lesbian and candidate for the city's Board of
Supervisors, said at Sunday's demonstration.
   The service was performed by the Rev. Matt Garrigan of the
Radiant Light Ministries, a predominantly homosexual church. The
purpose of the ceremony was not just to join the couples but also
to support legislation to extend health and work benefits to
unmarried domestic partners.
   ``It was a very emotional experience,'' David Thompson, 27, said
after the ceremony in which he ``married'' Pat Parr, 38.

<TEXT>
   Singer Randy Travis is expected to win
at least two big honors at tonight's Country Music Association
awards, but the group Alabama, which has dominated such presentions
this decade, is up in only one category.
   Travis, a former short-order cook and dishwasher, is given a
strong chance to win entertainer of the year and to repeat as No. 1
male vocalist at tonight's nationally televised presentations.
   He is also among five finalists for single of the year and song
of the year, both for his self-penned ``I Told You So.'' The single
of the year is awarded to the singer and song of the year goes to
the writer.
   Reba McEntire, who has been voted female vocalist of the year
for an unprecedented four straight years, has strong competition
this year in a category rated a tossup. The other finalists are
Rosanne Cash, Kathy Mattea, K.T. Oslin and Tanya Tucker.
   The awards show, with Dolly Parton as host, will be broadcast
live by CBS, 9-11 p.m. EDT, from the Grand Ole Opry House. The
Mutual Broadcasting System will carry a stereo radio simulcast. CTV
will carry the show live in Canada.
   The band Alabama is a finalist in only one category _ vocal
group of the year.
   Joining Travis as finalists for entertainer of the year, the top
award, are the Judds, McEntire, George Strait and 1987 winner Hank
Williams Jr.
   Vern Gosdin, Ricky Van Shelton, Strait and Williams are
competing with Travis for top male vocalist.
   Travis, 29, has sold 3 million copies of his album ``Always and
Forever.'' Earlier this year, he won a Grammy Award for the single
``Always and Forever'' and three awards from the Academy of Country
Music.
   In addition to being named top male vocalist last year, the CMA
honored him with album of the year and single of the year for
``Always and Forever.''
   All five finalists for female vocalist of the year have a
legitimate claim for the award.
   Cash, daughter of country star Johnny Cash, has a string of No.
1 records. Mattea had one of the top hits of the year, ``Eighteen
Wheels and a Dozen Roses.'' Oslin has already won a Grammy Award
for her ``80's Ladies.'' Tucker, who will celebrate her 30th
birthday Monday, is a 17-year veteran who has never won a CMA award.
   The Judds, a mother-daughter duet, won three straight CMA awards
as vocal group of the year until a rule change moved them into the
vocal duo category this year.
   Winners and finalists are picked by the approximately 7,000
singers, songwriters, musicians, disc jockeys and others in country
music.
   The show, which normally commands strong television ratings, has
been lengthened by 30 minutes this year.

   Rock star Ted Nugent, ``the Motor City Madman,''
says he has bagged one of the biggest black bears ever taken in
Michigan with a bow and arrow.
   ``When I saw him for the first time, I just couldn't believe how
big he was,'' Nugent, an avid hunter, said recently.
   The bear was estimated to weigh 525 pounds dressed (cleaned and
eviscerated).
   Ed Langenau, a big-game specialist for the Michigan Department
of Natural Resources, said the bear _ by weight _ was among the top
six ever taken in the state. The heaviest was 613 pounds dressed.
   Nugent has has hunted grizzly bears in Alaska, mule deer and elk
in the West and big game in Africa.
   Nugent, a resident of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, said he tries
to hunt as often as possible, though sometimes it's hard to get
away.
   ``We did 132 concert dates from Dec. 5 to May 15, so when I get
the chance to hunt, I'm gone, man,'' he said. ``In fact, I'm on my
way right now. It's whitetail season and I go buck fever.''
   Nugent already has plans for his prize kill.
   ``Oh, it's already split up,'' he said. ``I make sure that
everything I kill, I eat. Hey, by the way, I just had some bear
meat egg rolls last night.''

   Unemployed youths are robbing and beating up
elementary and high school students in the south China city of
Shenzhen, an official newspaper said today.
   A spokesman for Hongling Middle School said there were more than
20 cases in the school this year in which small groups of
unemployed youths, typically high-school dropouts, bullied students
and stole their money, the Shenzhen Special Zone Daily said.
   Other schools had similar problems, the paper said.
   Bullies repeatedly waylaid and stole a total of $80 from one
Hongling student who did not inform his parents and school
authorities because he feared reprisals, the paper said. The youths
also forced another student to steal money from classmates.
   On Oct. 4, four 17- and 18-year-olds held up a high-school
junior on his way home from school and beat him badly with iron
chains when he did not give them money. The student is still not
able to return to school.
   There have also been reports of juvenile delinquents threatening
and robbing students in Shenzhen's Lizhi Park, the paper said.
   Shenzhen, located across the border from Hong Kong, is one of
four special economic zones with greater freedoms to deal directly
with foreign investors and is regarded as one of China's most open
cities.

   The deteriorating health of a medical pioneer who
isolated the polio virus and developed the heart-lung machine led
him and his wife to their double suicide, according to a note at
their home.
   In the last 3{ years, Frank Gollan had an egg-sized tumor
removed from his brain, suffered a heart attack and underwent two
spinal operations. His 81-year-old wife, Alice, was blind and
suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
   ``My father made various allusions to suicide,'' said Andy
Gollan.
   He said he believes his 78-year-old father and stepmother each
took an overdose of pills Wednesday night.
   ``She was very dependent on him,'' said a neighbor, Elena
Herrschafe. ``He worried about what was going to happen to her when
he died.''
   The couple's bodies were discovered Thursday afternoon when
neighbors noticed they had not picked up their mail or newspaper.
   A spokesman for the Dade County Medical Examiner's office who
refused to identify himself described the deaths as ``unclassified
at this time.'' Results of toxicology tests could take up to two
weeks, he added.
   Gollan had polio as a child and grew up determined to find a
cure.
   He began his American career in Cleveland after fleeing Prague
in 1938 to escape the Nazis occupying his native Czechoslovakia.
   He came to the United States with his wife and qualified as a
medical practitioner in Ohio in 1939.
   His isolation of the type MM poliomyelitis virus aided other
scientists in developing a vaccine, said Dr. George Irvin,
professor of surgery at the University of Miami.
   In the early 1950s, Gollan invented the heart-lung machine for
use in open-heart surgery. According to Irvin, it had a ``major
impact on clinical medicine.''

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nationalist China celebrated its national
day today with a massive military parade that was considered a show
of support for Taiwan-born President Lee Teng-hui.
   The 70-minute parade in front of the Presidential Building,
where Lee and other officials watched, included a march by 13,000
goose-stepping cadets, soldiers and bare-chested frogmen and 600
armed vehicles as well as domestically-developed long-range
missiles and other weapons.
   Air Force jet fighters and helicopters flew in formation over
the large crowd in the parade area that included 30,000 overseas
Chinese, many of whom will be taken later at government expense to
visit major military bases, high-technology companies and scenic
spots around the island.
   Lee, 65, has been president since January when President Chiang
Ching-kuo died. He is the first native Taiwanese to hold the post
and there have been reports that the island's generals have gained
added power at his expense since strongman Chiang's death.
   Analysts said the emphasis on military might may also have been
intended to emphasize to China that there has been no softening of
Taiwan's anti-communist stance despite an easing of tensions
between the rival governments in the past year.
   ``Our armed forces have proved their strength in the parade,''
Lee told the gathering after the parade. ``We can give the
war-mongering Chinese Communist authorities a frontal attack.''
   Lee said the Nationalists are determined to recover the Chinese
mainland and reunite China under the three principles of
nationalism, democracy and social welfare advocated by Sun Yat-sen,
founded of the Chinese republic who died in 1925.
   Taiwan held 15 military parades after 1949 when the Nationalists
were defeated on the China mainland and retreated to Taiwan. But
since the mid-60s, the parades have concentrated more on
publicizing Taiwan's economic successes and civilian lifestyles
rather than its military strength.
   The Nationalists and Communists are technically still at war but
the late President Chiang adopted a more open policy toward China
in 1987 when he lifted martial law and relaxed a ban on travel to
the mainland to allow family reunions.
   National Day celebrations were also held in other cities and
they included mass rallies, folk dances, concerts, exhibitions and
fireworks.

   ``But I must tell you, they are all winners,'' said Pavarotti
late Sunday as he stood on stage at the Academy of Music at the
conclusion of the final auditions that featured 70 finalists.
   He had them all join him and take a bow along with the winners.
   The competition began 1{ years ago with 1,500 singers. That was
narrowed to 140 finalists from 18 countries who completed their
auditions during the last week here.
   They weren't competing for medals, money or first, second or
third place. The 40 winners now get the chance to perform with
Pavarotti.
   ``Just to get a chance to sing for him, to listen to what he has
to say is worth it,'' said Izabella Labuda, a Polish soprano who
was among the 70, but not among the winners.
   There were 19 winners in the first competition that began in
1980 with 500 singers and 54 in the second, from a field of 1,000.
The format for selecting winners has drawn criticism.
   Rumanian-born bass Julian Rodescu, now a U.S. citizen living
here, was in the audience three years ago and said he was like
those critics in asking ``How could they have 54 winners?''
   But as one of this year's winners, he said the whole thing makes
sense.
   ``No one else but he (Pavarotti) could do something like this,''
Rodescu said. ``There is no other competition where there is
someone of his caliber to hear you and to help you.
   ``This is where someone is trying to find, to single out and to
help talented singers by giving them recognition.''
   Pavarotti, who owes his own beginnings to a voice competition,
decided to start his own so he could return the favor to the
audiences who made him what he is today. Also, he said he wanted to
help find new talent.
   The proof of his competition, Pavarotti said, is that 85 percent
of previous winners are full-time singers and the competition
proved to be a big boost for them.
   Pavarotti will return to the Academy in March and April in his
normal role of opera superstar to lead casts for two operas
featuring competition winners.
   Each opera will have two sets of cast members from the winners.
Others not in those productions will be offered roles in other
operas during the next two seasons, according to Margaret Anne
Everitt, Opera Company general director and one of the three
judges. The third judge was Antonio Tonini, Pavarotti's own vocal
coach and a former conductor and coach at La Scala in Milan.

   Eds: LEDES with 10 graf to UPDATE with Soriano denying report.
PICKS up 10th graf, `Defense Secretary ...'

<TEXT>
   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile
denied today that he or any of his relatives had any links with an
alleged new plot to topple President Corazon Aquino.
   Enrile made the denial during a radio interview after Mrs.
Aquino's speechwriter wrote in the Philippine Daily Globe that
Enrile and his sister were linked to a new plot codenamed ``Oplan
Three Kings.''
   In the report, Teodoro Locsin, the Globe's publisher, quoted
National Security Adviser Emmanuel Soriano as saying that the plot
involves an unidentified senator and a sister.
   But Locsin claimed the senator was Enrile and his sister, Irma
Ponce Enrile-Potenciano, who owns a bus company.
   Soriano was quoted as saying the unidentified senator will fund
the rebellion which will be pulled off next January around the
Feast of the Epiphany on Jan. 6.
   The feast marks the visit of the Three Kings to the infant
Jesus, thus the codename.
   According to the Globe report, the plot called for buses to
ferry a main force of renegade soldiers, led by cashiered Lt. Col.
Gregorio Honasan.
   ``I am calling Soriano a liar,'' Enrile said. ``I challenge
Soriano to come out with details of the `Oplan Three Kings' so that
we can discuss it in any proper forum.''
   Soriano later denied having told Locsin of the alleged plot.
   ``I don't know who came out with that story ... I am making an
official denial,'' Soriano said in a radio interview.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told reporters that he was aware
of the rumored plot but said his information was based on ``raw
intelligence.'' He said it was unlikely Honasan was capable of
mounting another coup.
   Mrs. Aquino's government has survived at least six coup attempts
since it was catapulted to power during a civilian-military revolt
in February 1986.
   Honasan, with a force of more than 2,000 soldiers, led the most
serious attempt against Mrs. Aquino's government. At least 53
people were killed and more than 300 others wounded during the
failed Aug. 28, 1987 coup.
   The renegade colonel was arrested in December but escaped from a
prison ship the following April.
   Honasan was Enrile's security chief when the senator was defense
minister under former President Ferdinand Marcos and Mrs. Aquino.
Enrile was fired on Nov. 23, 1986, after a failed coup by his
followers.

   Two cars of an express passenger
train derailed at a station in eastern Yugoslavia, killing at least
33 people and injuring several others, the state Tanjug news agency
reported today.
   The crash occurred at 7:20 p.m. Sunday in Lapovo, about 50 miles
south of Belgrade.
   The train was on a regular trip from the southern city of
Skoplje to Belgrade when its last two cars jumped off the rails at
full speed at the Lapovo station and rammed into an engine of a
parked freight train, Tanjug said.
   A Belgrade radio report described the impact as ``tremendous.''
   Initial findings suggest that technical failure, rather than
human error, was the cause of the accident as the engine driver
reportedly entered the station observing all signals and did not
exceed speed limits, the agency said.

<HEAD>Court Dismisses Marcos Petition To Return Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The anti-graft court today dismissed
a petition by ousted President Ferdinand Marcos to return home to
witness the testimony of a former official on alleged kickbacks
during his 20-year administration.
   In a nine-page resolution, the court said Marcos' presence would
not be necessary when former Public Works Minister Baltazar Aquino,
who is reportedly ailing, gives his deposition Nov. 7 to Nov. 11.
   Marcos asked the court to allow him to return for the deposition
and act as his own defense counsel. But the court said the granting
of Marcos' request to return was a ``political question'' which the
government of Mrs. Aquino must decide.
   Marcos fled the country during the February 1986
civilian-military rebellion that ended his 20-year rule and
catapulted Mrs. Aquino to the presidency. He has lived in exile in
Hawaii since.
   In its decision, the court said Marcos can be represented by a
lawyer in Manila.
   ``Marcos can answer the charges by disposition, which is by
issuing legal statements from his home in Honolulu,'' the decision
said.
   It added that Marcos' ``recourse'' is to ask Mrs. Aquino to
issue him travel documents to return to the Philippines.
   Mrs. Aquino has repeatedly refused to allow Marcos to return,
citing national security.
   Lawyers for Marcos in Manila had earlier stated that if the
lower court rejected the former president's petition, they would
appeal the case to the Supreme Court.
   Marcos has not been formally charged in any Philippine court.
Philippine law bans trials in absentia, and the Mrs. Aquino's
government has delayed criminal proceedings for fear Marcos would
insist on attending the trial.
   Marcos is facing 39 civil cases on charges he embezzled up to
$10 billion during his term.
   Much of the money is believed to have been stashed in secret
Swiss bank accounts. Swiss authorities have refused to lift banking
secrecy laws until the Philippine government files criminal charges
against Marcos.

   Cold, damp weather persisted over the Northeast early today and
thunderstorms soaked parts of the Gulf Coast and the southern
Rockies.
   Record temperatures in the 100s baked southern California Sunday
and sent more than 300,000 people to the beaches. Los Angeles
posted a record high for the date of 102 degrees, breaking the old
mark set in 1976 by 4 degrees and forcing some players at the Miami
Dolphins-Los Angeles Raiders contest at the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum to leave the game briefly.
   Highs were forecast to drop back into double digits today.
   Temperatures were only in the upper 20s and 30s in northern New
England and northern New York state. Cloudy skies stretched across
much of the northern Atlantic Coast region, with rain limited
mainly to Pennsylvania and New York.
   Rain fell along the coast of Louisiana and in eastern Texas
Sunday evening. Lafayette, La., recorded marble-sized hail and wind
gusts up to 40 mph. Thunderstorms also hit southeastern Arizona and
southwest New Mexico.
   Dry weather prevailed elsewhere with mostly clear skies over the
central Mississippi Valley, the Plains and the area west of the
Rockies.
   Today's forecast called for scattered rain from the Great Lakes
and upper Ohio Valley to western and northern New England. A few
showers and thunderstorms were expected to develop from Arizona and
southern Utah into New Mexico and southern Texas.
   Mostly sunny skies were forecast for the rest of the nation,
with gusty winds in the upper Mississippi Valley and the northern
Great Lakes.
   Highs were expected to be in the 60s or 70s across much of the
nation; in the 40s in northern New England; in the 50s from
southern New England across the Great Lakes and south to the
central Appalachians; in the 80s in Oregon and southwest Idaho,
southern Texas and southern Florida; in the upper 80s to mid-90s in
California; and up to 105 degrees in the desert Southwest.
   At 3 a.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 29 degrees at Massena,
N.Y., and Plattsburg, N.Y., to 84 at Phoenix.

<HEAD>Return From Tokyo May Lead To Recovery Of Some Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fugitive financier's return to the United States
could lead to the recovery of some of the $25 million he allegedly
embezzled from investors, an official said.
   The FBI arrested Henry Gherman, 52, as he got off a plane in
Tokyo on Saturday after he was expelled from Taiwan, said FBI agent
William Wells.
   He has been a federal fugitive since August on charges of
embezzlement and mail fraud. He may have been in Taiwan as long as
six weeks, Wells said.
   ``There is a stronger likelihood now that he has been arrested
that we will recover substantial funds,'' said James Feltman, the
court-appointed overseer for Gherman's two investment concerns.
   Authorities said Gherman stayed in luxury hotels costing up to
$300 a night and spent lavishly on room service and telephone calls
to the United States.
   At the time of his arrest, Gherman was carrying up to $30,000 in
U.S. money and ``a sizable amount of Taiwanese currency,'' Wells
said.
   Gherman is accused of masterminding a scheme that may have
swindled nearly 50 investors, U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said in
a federal complaint filed Aug. 29 in U.S. District Court.
   Authorities said the investigation of Gherman's activities
continues and additional charges are expected.
   ``We think we'll be successful in locating some of those
funds,'' Wells said. ``We don't know how much. We just don't know
how much is left.''
   Feltman said actions against third parties can help mitigate
losses.
   ``There are a lot of financial institutions who aided him,
knowingly or unknowingly,'' said John Schulte, attorney for an
association of seven doctors for whom Gherman handled a $1.5
million pension fund. ``They could be subject to claims.
   ``The secret is to get this guy back. Without him, you have to
speculate and re-create. But with him, you have the person who is
the star witness.''
   Gherman had a ``longstanding pattern of embezzlement'' from
about 25 professional associations handling pension funds and other
assets for members, Lehtinen said. Gherman's scheme could have
affected nearly 50 investors, including smaller investors such as
clerks and nurses.
   Gherman made telephone calls to his wife and to Miami attorneys
after his disappearance, but authorities were unaware of his
whereabouts until U.S. citizens in Taiwan reported his possible
location there, agents said. Authorities then found him and
arranged his expulsion, said Wells.
   Wells said that if Gherman agrees, he could be brought to Miami
within a week, but if he fights extradition, the process could take
as long as 45 days.
   Gherman is charged with five counts of embezzlement and two
counts of mail fraud. He faces 35 years in prison and fines in
excess of $1.5 million if convicted on all counts, Lehtinen said.

   The dollar was lower today in Europe, where
trading was thinned by holidays in Japan and the United States.
Gold prices rose.
   Foreign currency dealers in Frankfurt, West Germany, said the
dollar was still under pressure from Friday's relase of U.S.
unemployment figures.
   ``It seems people are disappointed over the employment
figures,'' said one dealer with a major West German bank. But he
said few traders are prepared to sell the dollar heavily on the
basis of one indicator, especially in such a thin market.
   The U.S. unemployment rate fell 0.2 percentage points to 5.4
percent in September from 5.6 percent in August, while non-farm
payrolls rose 255,000 compared with 169,000 in August, the Commerce
Department figures showed.
   The market was open in the United States, despite the Columbus
Day holiday.
   Japan's financial markets were closed for Physical Fitness Day,
a national holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 132.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates in London at midmorning, compared with late
Friday:
   _1.8565 West German marks, down from 1.8608
   _1.5755 Swiss francs, down from 1.5795
   _6.3260 French francs, down from 6.3420
   _2.0915 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0988
   _1,383.75 Italian lire, down from 1,387.50
   _1.2077 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2116
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7075, almost one cent more
than late Friday's $1.6985.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $404.20 dollars a troy
ounce, up from $403.05 bid late Friday. At midmorning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$406.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $406.15, up from the $404.25 bid
late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.28 to close at a bid of
$409.34.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.34 a troy
ounce, slightly higher than Friday's $6.33.

<HEAD>Pope Calls For Economic Restructuring In France</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with speech in Metz. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>METZ, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II called today for ``a new
economic restructuring'' in an homily delivered to Roman Catholics
in a smokestack region of France afflicted by the decline of mining
and heavy industry.
   At a Mass here on the third day of his four-day trip to
northeastern France, the pontiff urged Roman Catholics to look to
their faith for courage in confronting crisis in society.
   ``Today the economic recession is leaving a large number of
residents of Lorraine without work,'' he told thousands of people
packed into the soaring Gothic cathedral of St. Etienne in Metz.
   ``It is a difficult problem. You are all invited to do
everything you can to bring about a new economic restructuring that
will offer everyone the possibility of work and a dignified life.''
   Although the Alsace-Lorraine region reports an unemployment rate
only slightly higher than the national average of 10.5 percent, the
jobless rate in industrial cities in the region is higher.
   The decline in heavy industry and mining has particularly hurt
immigrants who came in waves from Europe and North Africa during
the industrial boom years of the 1960s and 1970s and now make up
nearly 10 percent of the population of Metz and the surrounding
area.
   The 68-year-old pope, resplendent in a glittering gold robe,
spoke to an overflow crowd bathed in sunlight pouring in through
brilliant stained glass windows.
   He appealed to them to build a strong faith to withstand changes
in society. Although France is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, only
a small percentage practice their faith.
   The pope called on Catholics to construct a more humane society
and added, ``The task is immense ... but God will not abandon you.''
   On Sunday, the pope sailed down the Rhine River between France
and West Germany to bless boatmen and port workers as men whose
vision transcends national boundries.
   ``You constitute an inspiring milieu which shows a solidarity
frontiers cannot stop,'' the pontiff.
   His speech, delivered in German and French, stressed the main
theme of this trip, the unification of Europe.
   Later Sunday, the pope condemned anti-semitism in a meeting with
representatives of Strasbourg's Jewish community, saying it was
``opposed to the principles of Christianity.''
   Masses were also to be said today in Nancy. On Tuesday, the
Polish-born pontiff was scheduled to talk to the European
Parliament, a speech that will be the centerpiece of his visit and
will set forth the Roman Catholic Church's vision of a unified
continent.
   The parliament represents the European Economic Community, or
Common Market, whose 12 member nations have agreed to eliminate all
trade barriers between them and integrate their economies by 1992.
   The decision has has touched off widespread debate about whether
Western Europe should move toward becoming a single political unit.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain recently provoked
protests when she declared a U.S.-style European union would be
``highly damaging'' to the individual states.
   Pope John Paul has addressed European unity in a broader sense
during this trip, urging the EEC countries as well as Eastern
Europe and those nations of Western Europe that are not part of the
EEC to nurture their common heritage, which includes Christianity.

<BYLINE>Mother Says Film About Custody Fight Exploits Children
^By RICHARD BENKE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A divorced father is helping to make a
movie about his seven-year custody-visitation battle over his
daughters, but the girls' mother has gone to court in hopes of
stopping what she sees as exploitation.
   Don Chavez, president of the National Congress for Men in
Washington and founder of the Albuquerque-based Dads Against
Discrimination, said the movie will be about ``Dad trying to regain
a meaningful place in the lives of his children.''
   The plot has a father organizing a group of other fathers in the
same situation in an attempt to change the way judges award custody
and visitation rights.
   ``What fathers do not see coming is the reality of getting
laundered from their children or emotionally amputated from their
children when they get divorced from their wives, and that's what
happened to me,'' Chavez said. ``And so the story starts with that
kind of a loving father who struggles for the better part of a
decade to regain his status as a real parent.
   ``A real parent does not mean being Uncle dad or a Disneyland
dad who visits with his children on weekends.''
   The girls' mother, Marilyn Chavez Newhouse, has asked state
District Judge Robert Thompson to appoint a guardian to determine
if the movie is in their best interest and to decide how to protect
them from future publicity.
   Daughters Leticia, 13, and Michelle, 11, live with Chavez, 38, a
Bureau of Indian Affairs administrator, during the school year and
with their remarried mother during the summer.
   Mrs. Newhouse contends in her petition that Chavez, who also has
remarried, failed to consult with her about ``the effect or
advisability of exposing the children to additional media
exploitation.''
   Chavez said Mrs. Newhouse won't communicate with him except
through their attorneys. He said his daughters favor the idea of a
movie.
   Chavez would not say what production company is making the film,
and said he's unsure when the movie will be ready because of delays
caused first by the writers' strike and now by the Hollywood
Teamsters' strike.

   A mine exploded at a black
policemen's barracks early today, slightly injuring four officers,
police said.
   The bomb exploded at 1:55 a.m. near the Tembisa township police
barracks outside Springs, east of Johannesburg. Minimal damage was
caused to the building, police said.
   There have been more than 150 bombings in South Africa since a
national emergency was declared June 12, 1986. More than 70 have
occurred this year. The government blames most of them on the
outlawed African National Congress, which does not comment on
individual acts, but has adopted a bombing and sabotage campaign to
overthrow the white government.
   In their daily unrest report for the preceding 24 hours, police
said they had found the body of a black man who had been stabbed to
death at Nxamalala in Natal province where seven men were killed
the previous day in factional violence between black political
groups.
   In other black townships in the province, stonethrowers damaged
five houses and a church at Fredville, while two houses were
damaged by gasoline bombs in Mpumalanga.
   Two black men were shot when unknown gunmen fired shots at them
in Kwamakita outside Durban, in Natal, police said.
   Durban and other cities in Natal province have been the sites of
some of the country's most sustained black-on-black faction
fighting in recent years.
   The two main rivals are Inkatha, a political organization headed
by Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and the United Democratic
Front, a nationwide anti-apartheid coalition that the government
banned in February.

   Israeli-backed Christian militiamen killed two
guerrillas today in a gunbattle in southern Lebanon, the army
reported.
   It did not say, however, to what group the guerrillas belonged.
   Meanwhile, Lebanon's acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss said that
partitioning Lebanon into sectarian sub-states would trigger
longterm wars between Christians and Moslems.
   A guerrilla squad fired on the South Lebanon Army patrol
immediately after it found a large bomb along a road. In the
battle, two guerrillas were shot to death, and Christian militiamen
suffered no casualties, the army spokesman said.
   The gunfight occurred on the border of Israel's self-declared
security zone in south Lebanon, close to the village of Aaichiye,
nine miles north of the Israeli border, said an army spokesman on
condition of anonymity.
   In his comments today, Hoss was responding to a statement by
Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces, the main Christian
militia, that a federal system was the only practical way to end
the deadlock over presidential elections and Lebanon's 13-year
civil war.
   ``I challenge the advocates of federalization or partition to
draw up the borders of their cantons. This cannot be done,'' the
Syrian-backed Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, told The Associated Press.
   ``It will also lead to endless wars in the streets, alleys,
hills, villages and towns,'' Hoss said.
   Former President Amin Gemayel appointed a Christian military
government led by Gen. Michel Aoun in September at the end of his
six-year presidential term. However, Hoss' government refused to
resign and challenges the legitimacy of the new government.
   Under an unwritten national covenant dating to Lebanon's
independence from France in 1943, Maronite Christians have held the
posts of president, army commander and central bank governor.
Sunnis held the premiership, and a Shiite Moslem has been
parliament speaker.

   The Soviet Union said a pregnant prostitute has
died of AIDS, the first reported death from the disease in the
country.
   Authorities are considering publishing the woman's photograph to
alert her sexual partners, who were mostly foreigners, the labor
newspaper Trud reported. The 29-year-old woman died Sept. 5 of
pneumonia following a 26-pound weight loss, chronic tonsillitis and
bronchitis, Trud said.
   All are common symptoms of acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
and the newspaper said epidemiologists were angry that the woman's
doctors failed to diagnose AIDS before she died.
   Soviet officials say they have identified 83 carriers of the
AIDS-causing virus but only one person who has developed the deadly
disease. However, they say other cases may have been diagnosed
incorrectly.
   The AIDS victim was registered as a night school student and as
a factory worker, but police said she earned her living as a
prostitute, the report said.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread
most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by
drug abusers, and infected blood or blood products. Pregnant women
can also infect their offspring.

   Emperor Hirohito, bedridden for the past three
weeks, remained in stable condition today after receiving another
blood transfusion.
   Vandals today dripped red paint on a table holding a register
signed by the emperor's well-wishers in a shinto shrine in southern
Fukuoka Prefecture, local police said. Leaflets strewn at the site
demanded an end to Japan's monarchy.
   Also today, police near the Imperial Palace in Tokyo detained a
university student who tried to put up a poster accusing the
government of using Hirohito's illness to fuel rightist support for
military expansion. A police official said the student was released
after questioning.
   The 87-year-old emperor received 0.42 pints of blood Sunday.
Hirohito's fever stood at 99 degrees this morning, unchanged from
his temperature Sunday evening, according to Imperial Household
Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda.
   Maeda said there was no further discharge of blood from Sunday
evening through this morning. The emperor's condition will make it
``difficult for him to regain his physical strength,'' the
spokesman told reporters Sunday evening.
   Hirohito has been confined to his bed since he vomited a large
amount of blood Sept. 19.
   Maeda quoted Akira Takagi, the emperor's chief physician, as
saying palace doctors could not say whether the internal bleeding
has completely stopped. The emperor last discharged blood four days
ago.
   News reports also have said Hirohito has pancreatic cancer, but
palace officials have neither confirmed nor denied the reports.

<HEAD>Chicago Black Leaders Divided On Support For Mayoral Candidates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black leaders were unable to unite this weekend
in support of a mayoral candidate, and the keynoter at the session
said he fears the community is on the verge of ``political
fratricide.''
   Delegates at Saturday's meeting of black community leaders split
their support between two contenders, Aldermen Danny Davis and
Timothy Evans, while all but snubbing the incumbent.
   Davis garnered 24 votes from the delegates representing black
organizations and Evans got 23. Mayor Eugene Sawyer, a black who
was appointed to fill the vacancy created by the death of Harold
Washington last November, got just six votes.
   Two whites, former Park District president Edmund Kelly and
Lawrence Bloom, are also in the Democratic race. No Republican has
announced for the race.
   ``We are about to commit political fratricide and not have any
political power in this town anymore,'' said attorney Lewis Myer
Jr., the keynote speaker at the meeting.
   ``Unless we have unity we might as well hang it up today,'' said
the Rev. Willie Barrow, leader of Operation PUSH, the Chicago-based
civil rights organization founded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   More than 100 other black groups that were invited to take part
in the meeting either abstained or did not send representatives.
None of the mayoral candidates attended.
   The vote came at the second meeting designed to unify the black
community behind a single candidate.
   Sawyer was appointed mayor by a sharply divided city council
following the death of Washington, the city's first black mayor.
   A Cook County judge set an April 1989 election to fill the
remaining two years of Washington's four-year term. Primaries will
be held in February. Allies of Sawyer, arguing for a 1991 election,
have asked the Illinois Supreme Court to overturn the judge's
ruling. A decision is pending.

<TEXT>
   Inspection has turned up no damage
to the O-rings on the solid fuel rockets that helped boost the
shuttle Discovery into orbit Sept. 29, NASA reported today.
   A faulty joint that allowed gas and flames to burn through
O-ring seals led to the explosion of the shuttle Challenger and the
loss of its seven crew members on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Discovery's flight was the first since the accident, and its two
solid fuel rockets burned out as planned after two minutes and
parachuted into the Atlantic Ocean, where they were recovered and
brought to a hangar here for inspection.
   Ed Medal, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.,
said the left booster's three segments were taken apart Sunday and
the right rocket was being taken apart today.
   ``There is no evidence of any gas pressure on any of the
O-rings, including the new `capture feature' O-ring,'' Medal said.
``They really look good.''
   There are three joints in each of the 149-foot-tall rockets.
Each joint has three rubbery O-rings.
   On the Challenger, the joints each had two O-rings. In
redesigning the rocket, engineers at the Marshall center and at
Morton Thiokol, the manufacturer, added a third O-ring as part of a
metal lip, called a capture feature, intended to prevent joint
movement under pressure of ignition.
   An initial inspection after recovery ships retrieved the rockets
indicated they were in excellent condition, officials reported
earlier.
   Meanwhile, Discovery, back at its home base after its four-day
mission, was being inspected in a processing facility at the
Kennedy Space Center. It was ferried here Saturday, bolted to the
top of a modified Boeing 747 jetliner from Edwards Air Force Base
in California.
   The Discovery and its five-man crew landed at Edwards last
Monday after a flight during which the astronauts deployed a
communications satellite, conducted experiments and tested new
orbiter systems.
   NASA officials reported that the spacecraft returned to Earth in
good shape and would require little refurbishment. Once a few
protective thermal tiles have been replaced, workers will begin
preparing Discovery for its next flight, scheduled for Feb. 18,
with another communications satellite as the cargo.
   Meanwhile, Atlantis is being readied in an adjoining processing
bay for the next shuttle flight, a classified Defense Department
mission set for launch in late November.
   A payload for a future shuttle mission also arrived here
Saturday by truck from a Martin Marietta plant near Denver, Colo.
It is the unmanned Magellan spacecraft scheduled to be released
from Atlantis' cargo bay in April for a trip to explore the planet
Venus.

   Communist authorities today imposed
``urgent measures'' in the capital of the tense southern republic
of Montenegro, where thousands of people demonstrated in defiance
of a presidential order.
   The state news agency Tanjug, carrying a statement by
Montenegro's state presidency, said the ``urgent measures are being
applied because of a sudden deterioration of the political and
security situation and the possibility that it will spread.''
   Today, thousands of workers and students in the republic's
capital of Titograd and two other Montenegrin towns continued to
stage rallies and a protest fast. Twelve people were reported
arrested.
   The statement carried by Tanjug said the unspecified ``urgent
measures ... will be of a restrictive nature, aimed only against
those who are abusing the rightful demands of workers and other
citizens.''
   The language indicated police patrols would be stepped up and
firm action taken against provocative public protests. But it
suggested authorities would stop short of using restrictions such
as curfews, at least for the time being.
   On Sunday, President Raif Dizdarevic's warned that emergency
measures would be imposed if ethnic and economic unrest in
Yugoslavia did not cease.
   A national economic crisis, fueled by 217 percent inflation, a
$21 billion dollar debt and 15 percent unemployment, has combined
with tensions between Serbs and ethnic Albanians to fuel three
months of protests and calls for an overhaul in the party hierarchy.
   In Kosovo, one of two autonomous provinces in the southern
republic of Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics,
Serbs have rallied against the ethnic Albanian Communist leaders.
The mainly Christian Serb demonstrators want more control over the
mainly Moslem ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo.
   The statement carried by Tanjug today specifically attacked what
it branded nationalist and anti-Communist demands voiced during a
Titograd rally that was broken up by club-wielding riot police
early on Saturday.
   This morning, in the north Montenegrin town of Niksic, several
hundred high school and university students rallied in front of a
government building, Tanjug said. Several thousand striking steel
workers rallied at factory management offices.
   The news agency said that 12 people were arrested during an
overnight rally in Niksic and face charges for disturbing the peace.
   The continuing protests defied a warning made by Dizdarevic in a
hastily scheduled speech on national television Sunday night.
   Dizdarevic, who heads the nine-member collective state
presidency which acts as supreme commander of the armed forces,
appealed Sunday for calm, promised changes in the communist
leadership, and urged the government to undertake effective
economic measures.
   In his speech, Dizdarevic said recent Serbian nationalist
rallies and worker protests ``are seriously jeopardizing public
order.''
   ``There is a real danger that the actions which are imperiling
constitutional order could continue and spread,'' he said.
Dizdarevic promised unspecified measures to combat Yugoslavia's
economic problems.
   He also said the policy-making Central Committee, which is
scheduled to meet Oct. 17, will make changes in the country's
leadership. But he did not say who might be replaced.
   In troubled Kosovo province on Sunday, 20,000 people rallied to
press Serbian claims of harassment by the ethnic Albanian majority.
No violence was reported at the rally in Titovo Mitrovica, 145
miles south of Belgrade.
   Albanian Halit Trnavci told the crowd that Serbs and Albanians
should protect links forged through the centuries.
   Serbs have been pushing for greater control over Kosovo and
Vojvodina provinces and have embraced the drive of Serbian leader,
Slobodan Milosevic, who wants to increase his republic's power
there.

<HEAD>Demjanjuk Lawyer Claims Witness Intimidated, Files Court Motion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for John Demjanjuk, the retired
American autoworker convicted as a Nazi death camp guard, accused
Israeli authorities today of telling a potential defense witness
not to testify during the trial.
   Defense attorney Yoram Sheftel said a motion to present evidence
from Richard Glazier, a Treblinka survivor living in Switzerland,
was submitted today to the Supreme Court.
   Glazier refused to testify for the defense, Sheftel said.
   The attorney said a taped conversation between Glazier and an
American attorney indicates that Israeli authorities pressured
Glazier to withhold information that could have vindicated
Demjanjuk.
   ``We are asking the court to inform Mr. Glazier that he is not
obliged to keep his mouth shut,'' Sheftel said. ``This is a clear
cut case of obstruction of justice.''
   Demjanjuk, 68, was sentenced to death in April after being
identified as ``Ivan the Terrible,'' a sadistic guard at the Nazis'
Treblinka death camp who operated gas chambers that killed 850,000
Jews during World War II. He denied he was the guard.
   He was convicted of crimes against humanity and crimes against
the Jewish people and is now in an Israeli prison awaiting the
outcome of an appeal of his conviction sentence.
   Sheftel, reading from a transcript of the taped conversation
involving Glazier, quoted him as saying: ``I promised the general
attorney who investigated me, the Israeli attorney, not to talk to
anybody as long as the trial is not closed.''
   Sheftel said that when asked if Demjanjuk was ``Ivan the
Terrible,'' Glazier replied, ``I can't tell you.... Maybe he wasn't
at Treblinka.''
   The conversation took place in 1986 when William Wolf, an
attorney from Phoenix, Ariz., who assisted the Demjanjuk defense,
questioned Glazier, Sheftel said. Defense attorneys submitted a
transcript of the conversation today and asked the court to allow
the evidence in Demjanjuk's appeal, Sheftel said. The appeal is
scheduled for Dec. 5.
   A spokesman for the prosecuting attorneys in the case said they
have not seen the motion filed by Sheftel and would not comment on
it. Glazier, who lives in Zurich, Switzerland, could not
immediately be reached for comment.
   Sheftel said he spoke to Glazier ``a few times'' since the 1986
conversation with Wolf, and each time Glazier told him he was asked
by authorities to keep quiet during Demjanjuk's trial.
   ``He promised not to talk but he doesn't say why,'' Sheftel
said. ``It's clear the defense was not able to bring all of the
evidence to the trial. This casts strong reservations on all of the
proceedings.''
   During Demjanjuk's trial, defense attorneys said there were
death camp survivors who failed to identify the defendant as ``Ivan
the Terrible,'' but the defense did not produce any of them as
witnesses.
   Edward Nishnic, Demjanjuk's son-in-law and head of a defense
fund, said Glazier has repeatedly refused to talk to the defense
about whether he had knowledge of war crimes by Demjanjuk.
   He said in a prepared statement that Glazier previously had been
listed by the U.S. Justice Department's office of special
investigations as being unable to identify Demjanjuk as ``Ivan the
Terrible.''
   Demjanjuk was extradited to Israel in February 1986 from the
Cleveland, Ohio, suburb of Seven Hills. Defense attorneys maintain
Demjanjuk is a victim of mistaken identity.

   About 1,000 guerrillas trying to seize a
government post fought fierce battles with soldiers along the river
border with Thailand today, a government spokesman said.
   The Karen guerrillas raided perimeter outposts on Sept. 26, then
sent reinforcements to attack government troops at Methawaw, on the
western bank of the Moei River, said the spokesman, Kyaw Sann.
   More than 150 rounds from mortars and recoiless rifles, fired
from the Thai side of the river, crashed into Methawaw on Sunday,
he told reporters. Shells fired by the guerrillas inside Burma also
struck Thai territory, he said.
   The area is about 130 miles northeast of Rangoon.
   The fighting occurred less than a month after military commander
Gen. Saw Maung seized power from a civilian government and brutally
suppressed widespread anti-government protests led by students and
Buddhist months.
   Kyaw Sann, who gave no casualty figures, said the fighting
continued today ``in the second biggest engagement'' since Sept. 30
when government forces drove back 2,000 guerrillas of the Burma
Communist Party from Mong Yang in the east. The guerrillas had
attacked the government outpost Sept. 23.
   The government had said more than 200 communist guerrillas and
47 soldiers, including five officers, were killed in that fighting.
   ``In the northeast, near Mongko and Kyukok areas, we noticed the
Burma Communist Party massing troops recently,'' Kyaw Sann said.
``We are also preparing for any assault from them.''
   The Karens, an ethnic-based group, and the communists are the
country's two most powerful insurgencies. They have been fighting
the government for decades, the Karens seeking greater autonomy for
their areas.
   Kyaw Sann also acknowledged that more than 3,000 students had
joined the rebel groups since Saw Maung seized power in Rangoon
Sept. 18. He said some of the students were receiving military
training.
   Officials of three rebel groups told reporters in Thailand on
Sunday that 4,000 students and other civilians had joined their
ranks.
   Students were at the forefront of pro-democracy demonstrations
in Rangoon, but they were driven underground by Saw Maung's troops,
who have killed at least 440 people since the takeover.
   Kyaw Sann said 2,000 of the students had joined the Karens and
500 joined the communists while the rest joined five other rebel
groups.
   The Karens are among a dozen major ethnic minority groups in
Burma, a country of 38 million people. the Karens, who live largely
along the Thai-Burmese border and in the Irrawaddy Delta, number 2
million. During the colonial period large numbers were converted to
Christianity by american and other missionaries and enjoyed
relative freedom under the British rule.
   Feeling that the promise of autonomy within a federal system
after independence had been broken, a number of Karens fled to
jungle areas along the Thai-Burmese border and in 1949 rose up in
rebellion, managing to fight their way to the gates of Rangoon
before being pushed back to their sanctuaries.
   Karen leader Gen. Bo Mya said recently that his insurgent group,
called the Karen National Union, fields 17,000 troops.

   Vice President George Bush said today he
would study the federal prison furlough system to make sure ``it
never slips into the Massachusetts model.''
   Bush said he would ``review everything'' about the system if
elected.
   Bush's remarks came aboard Air Force Two as he flew to New
Jersey, one of several key tossup states the vice president will
focus on in the final weeks before the Nov. 8 election. His
Columbus Day speech today was to focus on crime and the rights of
victims.
   Reporters asked Bush about a remark by his chief of staff, Craig
Fuller, that Bush favors reviewing the federal furlough system.
Asked if he had any specific reservations about the program, he
said, ``I don't have any specific feelings at all. I just ... want
to be sure it never slips into the Massachusetts model.''
   Bush has been highly critical of the Massachusetts furlough
system, accusing rival Michael Dukakis of overseeing a system that
allowed murderers out on weekend passes.
   Bush had a light campaign schedule this week ahead of the
Thursday night debate with Dukakis.
   Aides to Bush, known in the past for deliberately seeking to
lower expectations for their candidate's performances, suggested
that the Republican nominee's preparations this time would be less
intense than the last _ perhaps even dispensing with a mock
practice debate.
   ``We view it (the second debate) as being important, but we
don't look for it making a big difference in the campaign,'' Fuller
said.
   On Sunday, Bush participated in a parade in an ethnic Chicago
suburb. The visit marked the fifth time the vice president has been
to Illinois, which has 24 electoral votes, since formally accepting
the Republican nomination in August.
   Aides said both Illinois and New Jersey, with its 16 electoral
votes, are deemed critical battlegrounds where the contest could go
either way.
   The vice president also will take advantage of the Los Angeles
site for this week's presidential debate to base operations in
California for several days beginning Tuesday. Bush will prepare
for the debate, interrupted by short campaign forays in the state
with the most electoral votes _ 47.
   Aides said Bush's California campaigning will be capped by a
daylong bus tour of rural communities in the state's Central Valley
next Saturday.
   The presidential debate is scheduled for Thursday, although the
date could change if rainouts force the National League baseball
series to be extended.
   Fuller said the vice president engaged in several hours of
debate preparation with aides on Sunday morning. Bush was spending
this afternoon alone with briefing books at his Washington
residence, ``without aides or advisers,'' Fuller said.
   The aide said former Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman,
Bush's sparring partner in practice for the first debate, would be
in Los Angeles on a standby basis. But there is a good chance
``there won't be a mock debate,'' Fuller said.
   ``He (Bush) is comfortable with debate preparations so far,''
the chief of staff said.
   On Sunday, Bush and his wife, Barbara, rode in an old-fashioned
fire truck and waved as thousands of people lined a two-mile parade
route between Cicero and Berwin, Ill., in the annual Houby Day
parade, a Czechoslovakian celebration of bountiful mushroom crops.
Houby is a Czech word for mushroom.
   ``This is the day we celebrate family, we celebrate faith and we
celebrate freedom,'' Bush said in brief remarks at the beginning of
the parade. ``And none of us will ever forget there is not freedom
in Eastern Europe and I have pledged as president to never forget
that.''
   To scattered protesters chanting the anti-Bush chant ``Where was
George?'' Bush at one point gestured toward himself and said, ``I'm
here.'' He then called out: ``Where is Mike?''

   A newspaper reported today that Palestinian
guerrilla groups have agreed to set up an independent state on land
occupied by Israel.
   An emergency meeting later this month of the Palestine National
Council, or parliament-in-exile, is expected to include a
declaration of independence for the occupied territories and the
formation of a provisional government.
   The council must formalize any agreement by the guerrilla groups
to set up an independent state or a provisional government.
   Quoting an aide to Palestine Liberation chief Yasser Arafat, the
Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Quabas said in today's editions that leaders
of several rebel groups ``unanimously adopted a decision to set up
an independent Palestinian state and declare sovereignty on
Palestinian land.''
   ``We declare this to the entire world. It is a milestone in
Palestinian history,'' the newspaper quoted Arafat aide Salah
Khalaf as saying.
   The newspaper said it reached Khalaf by telephone Sunday night
at the end of three days of intensive talks among several
Palestinian factions at Palestine Liberation Organization
headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia.
   The PLO has been debating for months its agenda for the future
of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in light of the
10-month uprising by the 1.5 million Palestinian inhabitants. It
also wants to fill the vacuum left when King Hussein curtailed
Jordan's administrative links with the occupied territories in July.
   On Sunday, the state-run newspaper Al-Ittihad of Abu Dhabi
quoted PLO spokesman Jameel Hilal as saying that Oct. 25 has been
fixed as date for the council session and that the meetings will be
held as scheduled in Algiers.
   But Khalaf indicated the Algiers site might be changed, possibly
because of the riots in the North African country.
   Khalaf, also known as Abu Iyad, denied reports that the Soviet
Union asked the PLO to postpone declaration of a Palestinian state.
   ``The Soviets have told us they support any PLO decision,'' he
said.
   Khalaf said that a PLO delegation led by Farouk Kaddoumi, head
of the PLO Political Department, had left Tunis for Moscow to sound
out Soviet leaders on future PLO steps.
   He emphasized that the council meeting will be held before the
Israeli national elections on Nov. 1. ``This is our final
decision,'' he said of the latest PLO discussions.

capital of Gaborone, the Botswana Press Agency reported today. He
was 68.
   Ketlogetswe was flown to Gaborone on Oct. 1 after American
doctors advised him he should return home, said the agency, quoting
unidentified foreign affairs officials in Botswana. The news agency
did not say when Ketlogetswe died, or give the cause of death.
   Ketlogetswe had been ambassador to the United States for three
years. Prior to that, he served as mayor of Gaborone and a member

   Abortion opponents have ended their
demonstrations for the time being, leaving 282 people still in jail
today after a week of protests.
   About 137 of those still jailed have applied for bond but have
not been processed, Tom Pocock, deputy director of the Atlanta
Corrections Bureau, said this morning.
   He said the 137 had given their names to authorities and should
be released by Thursday. Police arrested 463 people during the
recent protests, and had released 181 by this morning, Pocock said.
   He said 145 others in custody had not applied for bond and had
not given their real names.
   Many of those arrested identify themselves only as ``Baby Jane
Doe'' or ``Baby John Doe'' and cannot be freed on bond, the city
says. The protesters say the ``Doe'' names symbolize their
solidarity with aborted fetuses.
   Operation Rescue, the New York-based organization that organized
the protests, has accused the city of purposely delaying the
releases to keep the demonstrators in jail until the organizers
leave.
   The city accuses Operation Rescue of boasting that it would clog
the city's judicial process with hundreds of arrests, and says the
demonstrators succeeded.
   The aim of the week of demonstrations was to block clinic
entrances to prevent women from entering or persuade them not to
have abortions. Clinic operators said most of the appointments were
kept, and some brought patients in before dawn to avoid the pickets.
   Processing of the prisoners has been delayed because city
officials have refused to separate the paperwork of Operation
Rescue prisoners from that of other cases. The prisoners have
complained of inadequate bedding and towels.
   Pocock said the city had received a list from Operation Rescue
of those who should be released first based on family, job or
health concerns, and about 40 of those on the list had been
released.
   Since Operation Rescue came to Atlanta in July for the
Democratic National Convention, police have arrested 1,235
demonstrators. Even before last week's resumption of
demonstrations, city officials said they had spent more than
$500,000 on security, arrests, jail and court costs.

   A tractor driver was arrested for public
intoxication after 11 teen-agers were injured when a hayride wagon
overturned.
   A girl who suffered internal injuries in the Saturday night
accident was listed in critical condition, while a boy was
hospitalized with a neck injury.
   The driver, John R. Pourchot, 34, was arrested for public
intoxication and released on his own recognizance.
   One of the two wagons being pulled by the tractor overturned
about 10:45 p.m. Saturday as it was going down a steep road in
Eagle Creek Park, authorities said. Many of the 40 passengers were
affiliated with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes group at
Speedway High School.
   Mark Lewis, 15, who was listed in satisfactory condition, said
Pourchot, a parks department employee, had been ``acting a little
crazy and he was going too fast.''
   ``It was down the hill and he said, `You guys ready for Suicide
Hill?' He was going about 30 miles per hour when this happened,''
Lewis said.
   Joseph Wynns, deputy director of the parks department, said
Pourchot was a light-equipment operator whose normal duties
included driving for such events.
   The most seriously injured was Lisa Reed, 14, who was pinned
beneath the wagon. She was listed in critical condition Sunday
night at St. Vincent Hospital.
   Nine other people were treated at the hospital and released.

<HEAD>Dukakis Unveils Housing Program; Keeps Heat On Quayle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LEVITTOWN, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis today visited this
post-World War II model community to unveil a housing program that
would allow first-time buyers to use IRA and pension savings for a
down payment on a home.
   The Democratic presidential nominee told a Levittown gathering
that the Reagan-Bush administration had broken the federal
government's longstanding promise to help families buy their first
home.
   ``We rolled up our sleeves _ Democrats and Republicans alike _
and made a great national promise, a promise to provide affordable
housing for all Americans,'' Dukakis said of the initiatives which
helped build Levittown.
   ``The administration that Mr. Bush has been a part of broke that
promise in the early 1980s,'' Dukakis said. He delivered the speech
at a high school after visiting with Lou and Betty Tolano, owners
of one of the original Levittown homes, and several of their
children.
   Among them was to be Steve Tolano and his wife, Lisa, who are
expecting a baby and are living with the elder Tolanos because they
cannot afford a home. But Lisa Tolano went into labor prior to the
meeting and was taken to an area hospital.
   Dukakis was headed next into New York City, to march in the
Columbus Day parade.
   Dukakis chided the vice president for declaring that ``housing
is up'' during their recent debate and also kept the heat on
Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, the Republican vice presidential nominee.
   ``He's right,'' Dukakis said of Bush's debate statement.
``Housing is `up,' so much it's almost out of sight in much of this
country. Since this administration took office, the price of houses
has raced ahead of people's wages and has made it impossible for
many people to buy the homes they grew up in.
   ``George Bush has no housing program,'' he continued. ``He has
no solutions. He has no new ideas.''
   Dukakis blamed Reagan administration cuts in housing programs
for the escalation of homelessness in the past eight years and said
much of the problem was rooted in the lack of affordable housing
for young families.
   The Dukakis plan, called Home Start, would allow first-time
homebuyers to use their Individual Retirement Account or other
tax-deferred pension savings for a down payment on a home. Dukakis
said the plan was a ``natural extension'' of the goal behind such
accounts.
   ``Under current law, young families can speculate on stocks or
gold, or soybean futures with these funds,'' Dukakis said. ``Home
Start will let them make the best investment they can _ in a home
for their families.''
   Dukakis, in the speech, said the program also would include
provisions to lower down payments and closing costs and to raise
borrowing limits on federally guaranteed mortgages. He did not cite
a cost estimate and campaign aides were not immediately available
to discuss the plan.
   Dukakis said the program would complement his proposal for a
National Partnership for Affordable Housing, which is modeled after
a Massachusetts program that uses some state money and agreements
with private developers to build moderately priced housing for
first-time buyers.
   ``George Bush and his friends are satisfied; they say all is
well,'' Dukakis said. ``Dan Quayle is the only cloud on their
horizon. They're right to worry about Mr. Quayle. And so are the
American people.''
   Dukakis, who was accompanied on his New York stops by Gov. Mario
Cuomo and John F. Kennedy Jr., was returning to Boston after the
parade and was spending the afternoon preparing for his second and
final debate with Bush Thursday in Los Angeles. The Massachusetts
governor was flying to California on Tuesday and was to remain
there through the debate.

<TEXT>
   The state bar association's
disciplinary counsel today recommended that former mayor Mike
Roark's be suspended from practicing law for nearly three years.
   In briefs filed with a subcommittee of the bar's Committee on
Legal Ethics, however, Roark's attorney argued that his client
should be suspended for no longer than a year.
   Subcommittee chairman Arthur Recht said he did not know when a
decision would be made.
   Roark, 43, a former state and federal prosecutor, pleaded guilty
Nov. 17 to six misdemeanor federal counts of cocaine possession. He
was released July 20 after serving 5{ months in prison, and was
placed on three years' probation.
   Roark, who agreed to resign as mayor as part of his plea,
testified before the bar's three-member tribunal that he did
nothing to turn in or prosecute the two men who supplied him with
cocaine.
   The bar's disciplinary counsel, Jack Marden, recommended that
Roark's license be suspended until he has finished his probation.

   Cheryl Pierson, the high school
cheerleader who hired a classmate to kill her father after what she
said were years of sexual abuse, has married  The well-heeled Gucci image
suffered its first jolt when Paolo
proposed more inexpensive products and licensing and his relatives
opposed the plans.
   The disagreement exploded into an argument at a 1982 board
meeting and, according to a suit filed by Paolo, his relatives
smashed a tape recorder over his head.
   They denied the charge and the case was eventually dismissed.
   In a subsequent lawsuit by Paolo, charging that his family had
blocked his efforts to trade under his own name, produced documents
alleging that his father, 81-year-old Aldo, evaded taxes in the
United States. The suit was dismissed, but the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service picked up on the documents and in January 1986,
Aldo pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges in a federal court in
New York City. He was sentenced to a year in prison but was allowed
to serve part of his sentence at a halfway house in West Palm
Beach, Fla.
   Gucci relatives were aghast at the war threatening to tear apart
the family and the firm it had built.
   ``The company was a part of my life,'' says Giorgio, Paolo's
older brother. ``I had always smelled the perfume of leather, had
always watched my grandfather in the shop in Florence, working with
so much energy.''
   In 1984, Maurizio used his 50 percent of the company to seize
control and oust Aldo. The young, bespectacled Maurizio brought in
a new team of managers.
   ``The board decided the company had to be professionally
managed,'' explains Cucchiani, one of the young, American-educated
executives.
   But older family members saw it differently.
   ``Maurizio wanted to overcome the idea of a family firm,'' says
his cousin Giorgio.
   Peace did not reign for long. Maurizio's relatives alleged that
the papers giving him half the company on his father's death in
1983 had forged signatures. Maurizio's shares were frozen.
   Based on his relatives charges, courts in Florence and Milan
charged Maurizio with exporting capital and evading taxes. An
arrest warrant was issued and Maurizio took refuge in Switzerland.
   To replace him, state-appointed custodians of his shares
appointed a Milan business professor, Maria Martellini.
   ``A new era has begun,'' Martellini says. ``The company has a
place in the market that is more important than the specific
problems of the Gucci family.''
   Under its new management, the company has launched a program to
expand production, standardize the quality of its stores and trim
its product line, which had expanded beyond leather goods to
100,000 items.
   Sales increased by nearly 4 percent, from 229.7 billion lire in
1986 to 238 billion lire in 1987 _ about $170 million at current
exchange rates.
   Guccio Gucci's linked initials still adorn the firm's handbags,
luggage and scarves. And in workshops in Florence, apron-clad
artisans cut black and cobalt-blue alligator skins and guide
handbags through sewing machines.
   But the Guccis are nearly gone from Gucci.
   Last spring, Giorgio and his brothers Roberto and Paulo decided
to sell most of their shares in the company. The purchaser was
Investcorp, an Arab investment bank.
   While a judge ruled in July that 40-year-old Maurizio could
return to Italy, his shares are frozen. If he loses his court
cases, he may have to sell some.
   Giorgio says he parted with his shares because the new
management was not interested in his ideas and the traditional
standards.
   The new managers, however, insist the company will continue to
reflect the vision of Guccio Gucci.
   ``There is a tremendous strength that goes beyond the fights and
feuds,'' says Cucchiani. ``The strength is the consumer who wants
this brand. The strength is also with the people who work with the
company that want the Gucci splendor, and the artisans that want
that splendor.
   ``The name has got a magic connotation.''

<HEAD>State Probing 1985 Death of Police Cadet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state's chief medical examiner has
reopened an investigation into the death of a state police academy
cadet in the wake of the hospitalization of 16 cadets at another
state academy.
   James Whitehouse, 22, of Braintree died in 1985 after training
at the police academy in Framingham. Then-Medical Examiner Luke
Tedeschi ruled that Whitehouse died from a genetic tendency to
develop a disorder known as malignant hyperthermia.
   However, Tedeschi has since called for the case to be reopened,
saying he made his diagnosis on the basis of faulty information,
including police claims that Whitehouse had been exercising only
moderately.
   Brian Blackbourne, the current state medical examiner, has
agreed to the request and started a new investigation into
Whitehouse's death.
   Last month, 16 cadets out of a class of 50 were hospitalized for
dehydration, kidney failure and other problems shortly after
beginning training at another state police academy, the one at
Agawam in western Massachusetts. One of the cadets later had to
have a liver transplant and remains in critical condition.
   Academy officials have said the training was stressful to
prepare the cadets for the stresses of police work, but not abusive.
   Those who inherit the tendency toward malignant hyperthermia, as
Whitehouse apparently did, may fall prey during surgery to a
potentially deadly combination of rapidly rising body temperature,
shock and other problems.
   But Tedeschi said there are no recorded cases of a person with
the tendency dying after exercising. In fact, he said, several
professional football players have the disorder.
   Police instructors have maintained that Whitehouse died of the
genetic disorder and that the cadet was not subjected to enough
strenuous exercise to cause heat stroke in a normal person. They
also have said that he received prompt medical attention.
   However attorney John Marani, who is representing the Whitehouse
family, said the cadet collapsed from heat stroke and was not given
medical assistance for 45 minutes.
   ``I feel the 45-minute delay directly resulted in his death,''
the attorney said.

<HEAD>Council Decides To Extradite Terrorist Suspect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK QUINN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judicial council today decided to
extradite to the United States a Palestinian accused of planting a
bomb that killed one person and injured 15 aboard a Pan Am jetliner
over Hawaii in 1982.
   However, defense lawyers appealed to the Areos Pagos, Greece's
supreme court, to revoke the decision to extradite 39-year-old
Mohammed Rashid. The country's highest judicial body will hear the
case within a month.
   ``There is a majority decision by the council for extradition.
Its decision is based on a portion of the U.S. request,'' appeals
court judge Stavros Gardikiotis said. Under Greek law, the appeals
council examines cases that involve crimes committed outside Greece.
   Gardikiotis said there was enough evidence presented by the
United States to back up its charges that Rashid planted a bomb
aboard the jetliner. A Japanese teen-ager was killed and 15 people
injured in the explosion.
   The council rejected as ``insufficient'' other U.S. claims
linking Rashid to the attempted 1982 bombing of another Pan Am
jetliner in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. No details of the alleged
bombing attempt were released in court.
   The council had twice postponed hearing the extradition request
for Rashid, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and
delayed issuing its decision for one week.
   ``This decision is a blow to the PLO,'' Rashid told The
Associated Press. ``I will repeat once again that neither I nor the
PLO engage in terrorism. I trust the Greek justice system and will
be vindicated by the Areos Pagos.''
   Rashid also may be linked to an attack aboard the Greek cruise
ship on July 11 that killed nine people and injured 98. Police
theorize the attack may have been a botched attempt to take the
ship hostage and force Rashid's release.
   The Palestinian was arrested at Athens airport May 29 after a
tip from the U.S. Embassy. He was sentenced to seven months
imprisonment on July 14 for entering Greece on a forged Syrian
passport.
   In a separate hearing today, an appeal court upheld Rashid's
passport conviction but reduced the sentence to five months. He was
allowed to pay a $400 fine instead of serving the sentence.
   ``This doesn't mean he can go free. He continues to be held
until the extradition request is heard by the Areos Pagos,'' said
Rashid's lawyer, Spyros Fitrakis. He said the defense will argue
that the Greek constitution ``forbids the extradition of aliens
prosecuted for their action as freedom fighters.''
   ``As a member of the PLO my client is a freedom fighter,''
Fitrakis said.
   The United States considers the PLO a terrorist organization.
   U.S. officials have claimed Rashid also was involved in the 1986
bombing of a TWA jetliner flying over southern Greece that killed
four Americans. The TWA blast is not mentioned in the extradition
request.

<TEXT>
   George Bush's presidential campaign hastily
changed today's campaign event after a local Knights of Columbus
official said the vice president was not welcome to make a
political speech to the group.
   Bush toured an Italian bakery and neighborhood before speaking
to a gathering sponsored by an Italian-American group. Press
secretary Sheila Tate said the Knights of Columbus, a Roman
Catholic men's group, decided not to sponsor the speech because of
its tax status as a non-profit organization.
   ``The Knights of Columbus cannot and will not take part'' in a
program to be held for Bush, Grand Knight Ben Valeri told The Times
of Trenton. ``We're not a dictatorship. If members of the Knights
want to greet Bush or any other political (figure) or want to go to
the Bush speech, they can do so on their own. But not as members of
the Knights of Columbus.''
   However, the head of the state Knights of Columbus, Bernie
McGlone, stood up at the Bush gathering and declared: ``I want to
make it perfectly clear that the state council is sponsoring the
event ... and we're proud of it.''
   Valeri's wife had said earlier that her husband objected to the
visit because the Knights are supposed to be non-political.
   William Palatucci, executive director of the Bush campaign in
New Jersey, insisted that Valeri agreed during phone conversations
last week to take part in a Bush visit.
   ``I was as surprised as anyone to see his comments in the
paper,'' Palatucci said. ``When I spoke to him Thursday and Friday,
he said it would be an honor to have the vice president.''
   Local Bush organizer John Hansburg said Valeri's remarks
resulted from pressure by Democratic committeemen.
   ``He's closely connected to the Democratic organization,''
Hansburg said. ``They got to him.''
   Hansburg said he didn't know which committeemen may have
pressured Valeri and said he had no evidence to support his claims.
   Palatucci said Roman Hall, where the vice president was
scheduled to speak Monday, is frequently rented but not owned by
the Knights of Columbus.

   The percentage of precincts reporting in each state is given in
the column headed by ''PR''.
   A state's electoral votes are listed next. A ''W'' indicates the
candidate has won that state's electoral votes. Electoral votes
without a ''W'' indicate the candidate is leading.
   The popular vote for each candidate and the percentage of the
vote are in the final two columns. Percentages may not total 100
percent because of additional candidates on the ballot in some
states.

   NOTE: This breakdown counts the vacant seats in the 3rd District
in New Jersey and the 19th District in New York as Democratic and
the 2nd District in Tennessee as Republican. James J. Howard's
death in March left the New Jersey seat vacant, while John J.
Duncan's death in June left the Tennessee seat vacant. The New York
seat is vacant after the resignation of Mario Biaggi.
   The trend line gives the anticipated new party division for the
U.S. House. It is calculated by adding the number of races which
each party has won or is leading.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two cars of an express passenger
train derailed and slammed into a parked freight train at a
station, killing at least 33 people and injuring 15, the state
Tanjug news agency reported today.
   One passenger was quoted as saying the express train entered the
station in eastern Yugoslavia at high speed, then slammed on its
breaks. But the news agency said the driver obeyed all signals
while entering the station.
   The crash occurred at 7:20 p.m. Sunday in Lapovo, 50 miles south
of Belgrade. Rescue teams worked through the night to reach the
victims, using blow torches to cut through the derailed coaches,
Tanjug said.
   The train was traveling from the southern city of Skoplje to
Belgrade when its last two cars jumped off the rails at the Lapovo
station and rammed into an engine of a parked freight train, Tanjug
said.
   A Belgrade radio report described the impact as ``tremendous.''
   Initial findings suggest that technical failure, rather than
human error, was the cause of the accident as the driver of the
passenger train reportedly entered the station observing all
signals, the agency said.
   ``I felt the train arrived in the station at full speed before
braking suddenly. We kept on sitting for 15 minutes without knowing
what was going on,'' Merima Cvetkovic of Belgrade told the
newspaper Politika.
   Citizens offered their private vehicles to help ambulances
transport the injured to hospitals.
   The government of Serbia today asked federal authorities to
proclaim Wednesday a day of national mourning for the victims, but
there was no immediate word on whether the request was approved.

   A tractor-trailer truck slammed into the
back of a school bus near here today, knocking both vehicles down
an embankment and injuring the bus driver and 20 students,
officials said.
   The students, ages 5 through 17, attended the Everett School
District in this community of about 1,800 people in the
south-central part of the state. Four of the pupils were
hospitalized, two in critical condition.
   School Superintendent Edward A. Vollbrecht said the truck hit
the bus from behind as the bus was accelerating from a stop. The
bus was en route to Everett Area Elementary School and Everett Area
High School, he said.
   Witnesses said the two vehicles tumbled down a 25-foot
embankment.
   ``The school bus was down over the bank on its side and the
tractor-trailer was down over the bank on its side,'' said Floyd
Roberts, a volunteer firefighter.
   Most of the children were taken to Memorial Hospital of Bedford,
where 16 were treated and released within three hours, said nursing
supervisor Beth Arnold. Bus driver Randy Mearkle, 33, of Everett,
was also treated and released, she said.
   Two children were admitted to the Bedford hospital, while two
others, ages 14 and 15, were in critical condition with head
injuries at Conemaugh Valley Memorial Hospital in Johnstown.
   ``Most of them were just shook up,'' Ms. Arnold. ``They had a
few cuts, bumps and bruises, but most of them were fine. They were
pretty good. They were well-behaved.''

   Moslem guerrillas fired rockets into
Kabul, killing five or six people, a government official said
today. Official radio reported 20 people were killed today in a
rocket attack in Jalalabad.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan, a guerrilla spokesman today claimed the
rebel forces seized a small garrison in eastern Afghanistan,
capturing a fleet of military vehicles, a helicopter and a tank.
   In Kabul, the government official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said he did not know how many people were injured in the
Sunday night attack on the capital and could not provide further
details.
   State-run Radio Kabul said guerrillas bombed Jalalabad, killing
20 people and injuring 32. It said 20 rockets hit the town,
destroying at least two houses. The city is 70 miles east of Kabul.
   Azim Nasser-Zia, the spokesman for the National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan, said in Islamabad that the front's guerrillas last
week captured the garrison in the district of Gairu, 140 miles
southeast of Kabul.
   He said nine guerrillas were killed taking the garrison. He did
not list casualties suffered by the government or say whether
fighting continued.
   He said the guerrillas captured a helicopter, 100 small arms, 30
military vehicles and 10 tractors. The claims could not be
independently confirmed.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas have continued their attacks on
Soviet and Afghan troops despite the withdrawal of some Red Army
troops under terms of an accord signed in Geneva. Under terms of
the April 14 agreement, the Soviet Union is to complete its
withdrawal by Feb. 15, 1989.
   About 50,000 Soviets soldiers already have left. Between 50,000
and 60,000 remain, according to Soviet officials and Western
diplomats.
   Afghanistan and the Soviet Union have stepped up their effort
for a negotiated settlement to end the war that has been going on
since a pro-Moscow government was installed in 1978. In December
1979, Moscow dispatched troops to its southern neighbor to prop up
the government, which is dominated by a Soviet-style People's
Democratc Party of Afghanistan.
   Most of these efforts have taken the form of diplomatic pressure
on Pakistan to stop sheltering, supplying and arming the guerrillas.
   The party's Central Committee convened today and was expected to
consider further peace efforts.
   A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the meeting of the 500-member body was likely to continue
Tuesday.
   The party has about 200,000 members.
   During the spring, President Najib _ who is also the party's
leader _ named a new prime minister and four vice presidents in a
show of broadening the base of his government. The prime minister,
Mohammad Hassan Sharq, and two of the vice presidents are not party
members, but Sharq has long been known for his close association
with the party and with Moscow.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis today blamed the Reagan-Bush
administration for economic conditions that put affordable housing
out of reach for many Americans while Republican George Bush
continued to depict his rival as soft on crime.
   Both candidates kept their schedules light in advance of a
second presidential debate, which campaign staffers now say will be
held Thursday night _ barring a rainout in the baseball playoffs.
   Dukakis and Bush campaigned this morning but planned to spend
the afternoon in preparation for their Los Angeles encounter.
   In Levitttown, N.Y., Dukakis used the backdrop of a post-World
War II community to charge the administration with breaking the
federal government's post-war promise to help families buy their
first home.
   ``Since this administration took office, the price of houses has
raced ahead of people's wages and has made it impossible for many
people to buy the homes they grew up in,'' Dukakis said, unveiling
a program that would allow first-time homebuyers to use their
Individual Retirement Account of tax-deferred pension savings for a
downpayment on a home.
   Bush continued to rail against liberals on the crime issue,
saying ``Frankly, law-abiding Americans are fed up with the cruel
and unusual punishment inflicted on them by those who are soft on
crime.''
   Though he did not mention Dukakis by name today, Bush has
relentlessly criticized the former Massachusetts furlough program
under Dukakis' governorship. He said in a conversation with
reporters on Air Force Two today that he favors review of the
federal furlough program to make sure it doesn't ``slip into the
Massachusetts model.''
   Meanwhile, a series of state polls indicated that the Republican
nominee is solidifying his lead over Dukakis.
   Statewide polls in Kansas, Ohio, New Mexico and Missouri showed
Bush leading Dukakis while a survey of voters in 15 Southern and
border states found the Republican nominee holding a 12-point
regional advantage over his Democratic rival.
   The poll of 2,102 registered voters, conducted last week by The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, showed Bush leading Dukakis 49-37
percent with 12 percent of those surveyed undecided.
   The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage
points.
   Bush led in every state, including Florida, where he held a
26-point advantage, and Texas, where despite the presence of Lone
Star state Sen. Lloyd Bentsen on the Democratic ticket, the GOP
nominee enjoys a 14-point lead.
   Both are high-stakes Electoral College states. Florida has 21
electoral votes; Texas is the third biggest prize with 29.
   The survey also included Alabama, Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland,
Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia,
Georgia, Kentucky, Arkansas and North Carolina.
   With his support strong in the South, Bush turned his attention
Sunday to the Midwest and the crucial state of Illinois, which has
24 electoral votes.
   The vice president and his wife, Barbara, rode in an
old-fashioned fire truck along a two-mile parade route between
Cicero and Berwin, in the annual Houby Day parade, a
Czechoslovakian celebration of bountiful mushroom crops.
   ``This is the day we celebrate family, we celebrate faith and we
celebrate freedom,'' Bush said in brief remarks before the parade
began. ``And none of us will ever forget there is not freedom in
Eastern Europe, and I have pledged, as president, to never forget
that.''
   Earlier, Bush prepared for the nationally broadcast, 90-minute
debate scheduled for Thursday in the Pauley Pavilion on the
University of California at Los Angeles campus.
   The date had depended on the length of the American League
baseball playoffs, but that series ended Sunday when the Oakland
A's completed a sweep of the Boston Red Sox.
   If, however, rainouts extend the National League series, the
debate date could change, Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan said Sunday.
   The Bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which assumed
sponsorship of the debate after the League of Women Voters
withdrew, said Friday that the confrontation would follow the
format of the candidates' first meeting in which Bush and Dukakis
responded to questions from a panel of four reporters.
   After days of conferring with their advisers, the two candidates
are expected to be ready with their rhetorical salvos _ unlike the
comments Bush made in a meeting last summer with an Australian
official.
   Newsweek magazine reported Sunday that when Prime Minister Bob
Hawke voiced concerned that Dukakis might pull back U.S. forces in
the Pacific, the vice president sought to reassure the Australian
leader.
   ``If Dukakis wins, you've nothing to worry about,'' Bush told
Hawke. ``He's a solid fellow. He'll do all right by you.''
   However, Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate said today, ``It's not an
accurate quote.''

<HEAD>Negotiators Make Headway On Cuban Withdrawal From Angola</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with officials saying prospects for agreement
brighter.</NOTE>

   Prospects for a 4-nation agreement to pull
Cuban troops out of an African war were brighter today after
negotiators ``substantially narrowed the gap'' on their
differences, U.S. officials said.
   Although no final deal was struck, Cuban officials indicated
they were willing to step up the pace of the withdrawal of 50,000
troops from Angola as well as the 16,000 to 18,000 stationed near
the border with Namibia, the officials said.
   In exchange, South Africa would pull its troops from Namibia and
prepare the territory for independence and an election under United
Nations supervision of an assembly to draw up a constitution.
   But the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
negotiators would have to meet again and that ``further significant
decisions will be required'' before a final agreement is concluded.
   The talks were held over the weekend in New York and involved
officials from Angola, Cuba, South Africa and the United States.
   There already was a tentative understanding that the Cuban
troops would withdraw over 24 to 30 months. Some trainers were to
remain behind to assist the Soviet-backed government in its war
with guerrillas supported by the United States and South Africa.
   However, the questions were whether the withdrawal would be
``front-end loaded,'' meaning a sizable pullout in the early stages
to make the retreat irreversible, and how quickly the troops near
the Namibian border would leave.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said further
talks would be held soon but that it may not be possible to reach
the Nov. 1 deadline set by the United Nations for transition to
independence for Namibia.
   Still, negotiators ``substantially narrowed the gap,'' one of
the officials told The Associated Press.
   In Johannesburg, Roland Darroll, a Foreign Affairs spokesman,
said South Africa, Cuba and Angola had agreed that Cuban troops
should be withdrawn from Angola within 24 to 30 months.
   ``That was the agreement in Brazzaville. It was subject to
consultation with the governments,'' he said.
   He said he had no further information.
   Negotiators had not expected a breakthough at the New York
meetings. They were hastily arranged because senior diplomats from
all the nations involved were in New York attending the 43rd U.N.
General Assembly.
   South Africa has linked its willingness to cooperate with a
one-year independence plan for neighboring South-West Africa, which
it rules, to the withdrawal of the Cuban troops. Pretoria, which
pulled its soldiers out of South-West Africa earlier this year,
says Cuba's forces threaten the territory's independence.
   Diplomats involved in the talks had said they were working
toward reaching agreement on a Cuban withdrawal timetable at a
formal meeting to be held sometime later this month in the West
African nation of Congo.
   That meeting will be crucial because the negotiators are running
out of time to achieve a compromise before Nov. 1. South Africa has
suggested that date for putting into effect the U.N.'s independence
plan for South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Icebreaker Stuck In Arctic With Nowhere To Go, Maybe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard icebreaker Polar Star is at
Prudhoe Bay in northern Alaska, preparing to travel east through
the Northwest Passage after finding its usual route to the west
blocked by ice, the Coast Guard said today.
   However, whether the Polar Star will be allowed to make the
trip, through waters claimed by Canada, has been left up to the
U.S. State Department, Lt. Pete Marsh said.
   The icebreaker Polar Sea traveled through the Northwest Passage
in 1985, drawing Canada's ire. The United States government
maintained then that the Northwest Passage was an international
waterway.
   Rita Ragsdale, of the State Department's watch office, said
today that no press officer was on duty to comment because of the
Columbus Day holiday.
   A decision on whether to dispatch the Polar Star presumably
could have a further political impact in that the U.S.-Canada trade
agreement has stalled in the Canadian parliament. Congress has
already approved it.
   If the vessel doesn't head east, said Marsh, it would have to
winter over in the Arctic with a skeleton crew, as it did in 1981.
   He said that while the Polar Star was preparing for departure,
no decision had been made to head east.
   ``It's definite only that they cannot head west,'' he said.
``They tried a couple of days ago and couldn't break through.''
   The Polar Star had been on a normal Arctic research trip,
supporting scientists and their work, when it was delayed because
of assistance rendered to two Canadian icebreakers and because of
its own mechanical problems, Marsh said.
   ``It took a couple of days, and it was a couple of days too
many,'' Marsh said.
   If the Polar Star is to escape to the east, a decision will have
to be made soon, he said, before that route also freezes in.
   The Polar Star wintered over in 1981 in the Arctic, and it could
again, said Marsh. Most of its 140-member crew would be shipped
south to wait.
   But if the Polar Star is out of service over the winter, he
said, it could not be used as backup to its sister ship, the Polar
Sea. The Polar Sea leaves Seattle in a few weeks for the Antarctic.

<HEAD>Colorado City Sets Up Translator Network to Aid Immigrants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AURORA, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This fast-growing city next door to Denver
has set up a volunteer network of translators to help officials
communicate with the Asian, Hispanic and other immigrants arriving
here.
   Estimates are that 8,000 residents _ or 3 percent _ of Aurora's
population don't speak English, causing problems for police at
accident and crime scenes. They include speakers of Pushto, Dari,
Chippewa, Spanish, Czech, Farsi, French, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian,
Urdu, Polish, Russian, Tagalog, Ukranian and sign language.
   Aurora has drafted an emergency handbook for police and fire
officers to communicate with speakers of Korean, Vietnamese,
Cambodian, Laotian and Chinese.
   The city is also publishing a monthly newsletter for Asian- and
Spanish-speaking residents in four languages, including information
about cultural differences.
   Some of the volunteer translators recall how it was to adjust to
the language and the culture.
   ``Seven years ago when I came here _ it's just so difficult _
you don't know what people are talking about,'' said Sun Meeks, who
emigrated from Hong Kong and now helps translate Chinese languages.
   Anwar Necko emigrated from Afghanistan after the Soviet
invasion, arriving in Denver in 1982. He has volunteered to help
Aurora speakers of Pushto and Dari, the official languages of his
homeland, as well as the Iranian language of Farsi.
   Yves Genty, who moved to the United States from France 35 years
ago, now works for the city. He has volunteered to translate
Spanish and French.
   Genty got his first taste of the new volunteer program last week.
   ``A young lady from Juarez, Mexico, was given a traffic ticket
for making an illegal turn and had no idea what it was all about,''
he said. He translated for her in court.

<HEAD>Clocks Latest Symbol of Independence For Estonia</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When Soviets set their clocks ahead
next spring for an extra hour of daylight, Estonia won't switch
with them.
   The tiny Baltic republic will no longer tick to the time in
Moscow, 500 miles to the south, but to the time in Finland, 50
miles to the north.
   Thus, even the clocks will reflect the new spirit of
independence among Estonians.
   Long viewed as one of the most progressive of the 15 Soviet
republics, Estonia is trying in many other ways to set its own
course. Its leaders hope to use their independence to demonstrate
the effectiveness of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's social and
economic reforms.
   With the blessing of the republic's Communist Party, officials
are planning to open trade offices abroad, enter joint ventures
with Western companies without Moscow approval, return to family
farming, and even issue their own currency that, unlike the ruble,
could be traded on world markets.
   ``The Communist Party of Estonia can be regarded as one of the
front-rankers of the reconstruction drive. Estonia has been the
initiator of many reforms,'' said Estonian party chief Vaijno
Vyalyas.
   Vyalyas, a Gorbachev protege, appears to have his blessing. But
he and the Estonian activists leading the reform drive have been
careful not to go too far, as they say the Armenians have done in
their campaign for annexation of a region in the republic of
Azerbaijan.
   ``At the bottom of our hearts, all Estonians want secession,''
said Ulo Kaevats, head of the auditing commission of the People's
Front, a grassroots organization pushing for reform. ``But if we
did put forward this question, we would have martial law, and we
all know that very well.''
   Marju Lauristin, a journalism professor who helped found the
People's Front, also argues against extremism, citing the
Armenians' troubled campaign as a lesson.
   ``If we demand only maximalist ends, we will get nothing,''
Lauristin, 48, said in an interview.
   The self-restraint seems to be paying off for the People's Front.
   The group's blue, red and green emblem can be seen on posters,
flags and buttons throughout Tallinn, Estonia's ancient seaside
capital. State-run radio broadcast the front's organizing
conference live Oct. 1-2, and newspapers reported it on their front
pages.
   Even in Moscow, the centrally controlled press, which has
branded other such groups as ``anti-socialist,'' carried generally
sympathetic reports on the People's Front.
   The group, which formed in April and claims a membership of
60,000 in Estonia, approved a platform at its conference that, in
effect, calls for Estonia to establish its autonomy from Moscow in
all matters except defense and foreign policy.
   The People's Front demanded ``decolonization'' and seeks local
control of agriculture, industry and businesses without
interference from Moscow. The group also wants Estonian to be the
republic's official language and proposes curbs on the settlement
of non-Estonians, who make up 40 percent of the republic's
population.
   The group also is after political power. It has fielded
candidates in local elections and plans to put up more in
legislative elections next spring.
   So far, however, it has been careful not to challenge the
Communist Party directly.
   About 28 percent of its members also belong to the party, and
Vyalyas, the party's Estonian first secretary, sat through most of
the front's organizational congress, lending it a measure of
official backing.
   In a Sept. 9 speech, Vyalyas told the Estonian party's Central
Committee that he endorsed the front's demands for economic
self-management, ``restoration of historical truth,'' creation of
Estonian citizenship, and preservation of Estonians as the ethnic
majority in the republic.
   To compensate for what it calls a mistake of history, the
People's Front wants Moscow to renounce the 1939 non-aggression
pact with Germany that led to the Soviet takeover of Estonia and
the other Baltic states of Lithuania and Latvia. Unlike a smaller
citizens' group called the Estonian Independence Party, however,
the People's Front does not call for a return of Estonian
sovereignty.
   Giving Estonia a measure of independence is not without risk.
The Soviet Union has more than 100 nationalities and ethnic groups,
all with their own concerns. The central government must perform a
constant balancing act, showing tolerance for national and ethnic
goals while holding the union together.
   The experiments could reap rich rewards for the republic if
Estonian agricultural production increases, if foreign trade grows
and if consumer goods appear in stores. But they also could benefit
Gorbachev, who is trying to prove to conservatives that giving
Soviets more responsibility and incentives will improve life more
than the methods of central planning he blames for years of
stagnation and political repression.
   Estonia, with a population of 1.5 million, seems well-suited as
a proving ground for perestroika. It had experience deciding
matters for itself during 22 years of independence between the two
world wars, and many Estonians have been watching the prosperity of
their neighbors and linguistic cousins, the Finns, while their own
growth was stifled under Soviet control.
   Estonians receive daily exposure to capitalism by watching
Finnish TV, and the results are apparent in fashions on display in
Tallinn shops.
   But while Estonians enjoy some Western pleasures, they are
reminded constantly that they are still part of the Soviet Union.
   Even as jazz musician Lembit Saarsalu sat in the living room of
his Tallinn apartment watching ``The Cosby Show'' on Finnish TV, he
pulled out a white slip of paper.
   It was the latest in a series of rejection slips on his
application for a telephone. He's been trying to get one for 10
years.

   A new generation of desert locust swarms has been
forming throughout the Sahelian countries of Africa and in the
Sudan despite intensified control measures, a United Nations agency
said Monday.
   New swarms are ``forming relentlessly'' because continuing rain
has created favorable breeding conditions, said Edouard Saouma,
director-general of the Food and Agriculture Organization.
   Up to now, serious damage to crops has been prevented, he added.
   The locust invasion in North Africa, described as the region's
worst in three decades, began earlier this year.
   The FAO also reported that swarms of locusts have reached Gambia
and in Cape Verde. Large-scale breeding of the pests was reported
in northern Ethiopia.

   A meeting Sunday failed to end the walkout.
   ``In the face of management's toughening position, we are
prepared to continue our action,'' the striking employees said.
   Workers are demanding an increase in their hourly pay of about
$4.60, inclusion of bonuses in their salaries, and changes in work

   The management of the Eiffel Tower, which is the property of the

   The ``Human Rights Now!'' rock tour
filled this West African nation's national stadium for nine-hour
concert that ended early Monday.
   Sting, Bruce Springsteen, Tracy Chapman and other stars
performed under hazy tropical skies, in a concert whose aim was to
celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.
   More than 30,000 people filled the stadium, many of them
dancing, waving and singing on the grass as hundreds of fruit bats
circled overhead.
   Sting, asked at a pre-concert news conference what hope he had
of persuading dictators to democratize, said, ``The dictator is not
our target. The dictator doesn't listen to our records. He doesn't
know our faces. He doesn't care.
   ``Our target are his children, and his grandchildren, and his
grandchildren's friends, maybe his mistress, people who will
inherit the political infrastructures of the countries we visit. I
think there are more young people than old people in the world
today. We have a great deal of influence with that constituency.
And 10, 15 years from now, we hope that the seed we plant when we
come to a country will bear fruit in a very real way, in a very
pragmatic honest way, when these people achieve real power.''
   Springsteen, recalling the previous stop in Zimbabwe on the
20-city concert tour, noted that he plays to mostly white audiences
in the United States. ``I had a chance in Harare, for the first
time, to really play to an integrated audience.
   ``And for me, it was one of the most important concerts of my
life. There was a moment towards the end of the night when I ask
everyone to raise their hands. And looking out and seeing the black
hands raised with the white hands, was a very emotional moment for
me.
   ``Because I think when that happens, when black hands and white
hands are raised together, and when rich hands and poor hands, and
when hands from the east and hands from the west, that is when
governments tremble and that's the day they will pay more attention
to the articles of this document.''
   Other artists on the tour, whose next stop was Sao Paulo,
Brazil, included Peter Gabriel, Johnny Clegg and his group Savuka
and Youssou N'Dour.

   Rock star Ted Nugent, ``the Motor City Madman,''
says he has bagged one of the biggest black bears ever taken in
Michigan with a bow and arrow.
   ``When I saw him for the first time, I just couldn't believe how
big he was,'' said Nugent, an avid hunter.
   The bear was estimated to weigh 525 pounds dressed.
   Ed Langenau, a big-game specialist for the Michigan Department
of Natural Resources, said the bear was one of the six heaviest
ever taken in the state. The heaviest was 613 pounds dressed.
   Nugent has has hunted grizzly bears in Alaska, mule deer and elk
in the West and big game in Africa.
   Nugent, a resident of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, said he tries
to hunt as often as possible, though sometimes it's hard to get
away.
   ``We did 132 concert dates from Dec. 5 to May 15, so when I get
the chance to hunt, I'm gone, man,'' he said. ``In fact, I'm on my
way right now. It's whitetail season and I go buck fever.''
   Nugent already has plans for his prize kill.
   ``Oh, it's already split up,'' he said. ``I make sure that
everything I kill, I eat. Hey, by the way, I just had some bear
meat egg rolls last night.''

   A judge today dismissed federal
hostage-taking charges against Indian activist Timothy Jacobs, but
said he would leave it to a jury to decide whether his fellow
defendant was guilty on that charge.
   Four other charges against Jacobs still stood.
   Attorneys for Jacobs on Friday had argued that prosecutors had
failed to prove that he and Eddie Hatcher had made a demand on the
federal government during their takeover of The Robesonian
newspaper in Lumberton on Feb. 1.
   U.S. District Court Judge Terrence Boyle said this morning that
his reading of the statute showed that a demand on the government
had to be ``not just incidental, but material.''
   Up to 20 people were held hostage in the newspaper office for as
much as 10 hours while the two defendants demanded an investigation
into what they said was local corruption and racial discrimination.
No one was injured.
   Boyle said prosecutors had presented no evidence that Jacobs had
made a demand or had aided Hatcher in making a demand to the
federal government. In Hatcher's case, though, he said the jury
should decide the question. Testimony had indicated that Hatcher
did most of the talking during the incident.
   The hostage-taking charge was linked with a second charge of
committing a violent crime with an illegal firearm. Boyle also
dismissed that charge against Jacobs.
   Jacobs still faces charges of conspiracy, making an illegal
firearm, possessing an unregistered firearm and conveying false
information concerning explosives.
   In his ruling today, Boyle also indicated he would not accept a
``necessity defense'' for the two defendants because there was no
direct relationship between the hostages taken at the Robesonian
and the threats perceived by the two.
   The two defendants had argued that their lives were in jeopardy
because of information they had allegedly linking law enforcement
officers to drug trafficking in Robeson County. They claimed they
had no choice but to take hostages at the newspaper to publicize
their case and save their lives.
   Last week, defense attorney Lewis Pitts had argued for dismissal
of the hostage charge against Jacobs, saying that ``there is
absolutely no proof as to Timmy Jacobs making a demand on the
federal government.''
   Pitts argued that the federal hostage-taking law was designed to
deal with international seizures and that Congress had specifically
wanted strict limits on its use in domestic cases.
   ``What may have been done may have been conspicuously a crime,
but the question is whether it's a criminal matter against the
United States,'' Boyle had said Friday.
   ``It appears we have here a situation that the evidence appears
to show was a locally generated grievance,'' Boyle said. ``It arose
in Robeson County and it had to do with matters in Robeson County.
The demand (on the federal government) arose from a demand for
state action _ a special prosecutor _ which state law apparently
did not allow.''
   The federal prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Bruce, had
argued that the federal charges were relevant because the two asked
to surrender to FBI agents and included in their written list of
demands a requirement for a federal investigation in Robeson County.

<HEAD>Congress Aiming to Finish Drug, Tax Bills Before Adjournment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Its election-year antennae in full working
order, Congress is aiming to finish fashioning a
something-for-everyone anti-drug bill and a $2.7 billion tax
measure this week and then adjourn for the year.
   Both measures would satisfy a compelling urge that overtakes
lawmakers each election year: to churn out legislation popular with
large numbers of voters.
   Work on both, however, is being influenced by another instinct
that becomes unusually potent on Capitol Hill late in even-numbered
years: the desire to flee Washington in time to campaign for
re-election.
   Thus, when the Senate turns to the drug measure _ possibly on
Wednesday _ legislators will be struggling to finish their work
quickly or going home with no bill at all.
   ``Ninety-five percent of the good we'll do with this bill is in
the core bill,'' insists one of the sponsors of the drug
legislation, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga. ``If members from both sides
continue to insist on the more controversial amendments, we won't
get a bill.''
   The drug bill is a two-year, $2.6 billion collection of programs
ranging from an expansion of the availability of treatment programs
to a stiffening of penalties for people convicted of distributing
drugs to children.
   But lawmakers are lining up to offer an assortment of amendments
that are so contentious that the bill just might be debated to
death.
   Senators and their aides spent the long Columbus Day weekend
trying to figure out how to slash the number of amendments the
chamber will have to sort through, with Republicans ready to offer
six to 10 amendments and Democrats poised to introduce more than 70
others.
   Among the more controversial amendments are proposals to allow
courts to consider illegally gathered evidence that police obtained
in good faith; narrow the rights of prisoners to claim they were
jailed illegally; require a waiting period for people wishing to
purchase handguns and apply tougher sanctions against the apartheid
government of South Africa.
   An effort may be made to strip from the bill a provision that
would allow capital punishment for drug dealers who order killings,
for hired killers who commit murder as part of a drug enterprise
and for anyone who kills a law enforcement officer during the
commission of a drug crime.
   One matter the measure skirts is where the money will come from
for the very programs the bill would create.
   Although $1.4 billion of the legislation's spending would be
expected to occur over the next 12 months, lawmakers say the
government right now can only scrape together $450 million. The
Senate has so far voted down efforts to raise some taxes and to cut
other federal programs to provide the extra money.
   Even if the Senate finishes its work, the House and Senate will
have to agree on an identical bill before they can send it to
President Reagan for his signature. The House passed a drug measure
on Sept. 22 that provides the government with tough weapons against
drug dealers and users, including the death penalty.
   Before the Senate gets to the drug bill, however, it will have
to finish work on the catchall tax legislation.
   The Senate is ready to resume debate Tuesday on the measure,
which would extend expiring tax benefits to first-time homebuyers
and companies that increase research spending. It would also
provide benefits to farmers and free-lance artists and writers.
   The bill would require the Internal Revenue Service to fully
inform people who are being audited of their rights. And it would
require the government to purchase 540 acres of land that was the
site of the Second Battle of Bull Run in Manassas, Va., in order to
block construction of a shopping mall.

   A Japanese anti-submarine patrol plane saw two
Soviet missile destroyers sailing northward in the Sea of Japan on
Monday, indicating the Soviet Pacific Fleet has begun its fall
naval exercise, a Defense Agency spokesman said.
   The ``Udaloy''-class destroyers were seen about 120 miles west
of the tip of Shakotan Peninsula on Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost
main island, said Lt. Cmdr. Yutaka Nojima, the agency spokesman.
   OnSunday, five Soviet warships were seen by a Japanese patrol
plane off nearby Rebun Island, Nojima said.
   Last year, the Soviet Union mobilized more than 20 military
vessels in its fall exercise, conducted for about a week, he said.

   Seven months of bad weather, mosquitoes
and fear of living alone on the streets haven't halted Jacqueline
Smith's stubborn sidewalk protest outside the small motel where
Martin Luther King Jr. died.
   ``I'll be here for as long as it takes,'' she said, standing
beside a makeshift plastic tent that serves as her living quarters
outside The Lorraine Motel, where King was assassinated 20 yuears
ago.
   Miss Smith, 37, was evicted from the motel by sheriff's deputies
on March 2.
   A resident of The Lorraine since 1972, she refused to leave when
the crumbling motel was closed last January to eventually become
the centerpiece of a civil rights museum.
   ``I've been maintaining. I don't have any complaints,'' Miss
Smith said last week. ``I knew this wouldn't be easy.''
   She sleeps on a reclining lawn chair covered by sheets and
plastic and preaches to all who will listen that the museum is part
of a conspiracy to gentrify her downtown neighborhood.
   ``What they're trying to do is force the black people out and
they're using The Lorraine as a focus,'' she said.
   The area of The Lorraine, made up largely of warehouses and
rundown rental housing, was designated a historic district in 1982
and developers have launched several renovation projects there for
apartments, condominiums and offices.
   ``They're using The Lorraine Motel to get this land. They're not
fooling anybody,'' Miss Smith said.
   The Lorraine belongs to ``the people,'' she said, and should be
used as housing for the homeless or for some other public purpose.
   While hesitant to talk about her life on the street, she said
her food is supplied by friends and supporters who also donate
money from time to time. She has toilet privileges at a nearby
apartment, and she said a security guard has kept her company at
night for part of her vigil.
   ``The majority of the time I'm here alone, but I have great
moral and spiritual support,'' she said.
   A folding table beside her tent held several large pictures of
King, a jar for donations and a notebook for visitors to sign.
Three scraggly potted plants offered the only softening to the
concrete scene.
   ``Every now and then there are people who come by and scream
things out of their cars, but they pass so fast I can't even
understand what they're saying,'' Miss Smith said.
   Once, she said, a street person hit her with his fist for some
unknown reason.
   A rainy cold wave struck shortly after her vigil began and
temperatures during the summer topped 100 degrees. Insect repellant
used to combat mosquitoes caused a rash on her arms and hands.
   D'Army Bailey, a principal supporter of the museum, said he has
failed to convince Miss Smith that the project will be a monument
to King.
   ``There doesn't seem to be any rational, logical tone to her
perception of things,'' Bailey said.
   Part of the motel will be razed but the wing where King was
killed will be restored and will be at the heart of the museum.
Construction will begin in about three months, Bailey said, and the
museum should be finished in 1991.

<HEAD>Mississippi Oyster Season Opens, But Erratic Weather Devasting
Harvest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GULFPORT, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mississippi's oyster season opened Monday
amid dire projections that the 1988 harvest would likely be
one-twentieth of what it was only five years ago.
   Gulf Coast officials say erratic weather patterns and pollution
have combined to devastate the local oyster reefs. This season's
harvest is expected to be fewer than 20,000 sacks, compared with
the 365,560 sacks taken in 1983.
   ``Each year, it's getting worse and worse,'' said Kirk Ladner,
whose business, Terry's Seafood in Waveland, buys oysters from 17
boats.
   Ladner said because of the limited oyster population in
Mississippi waters and because the commercial dredging limit has
been lowered to 10 sacks per day, many oystermen will likely head
for Louisiana waters, where they can take 30 sacks a day.
   However, Ladner said Mississippi oysters are in demand because a
sack of them produces twice as much meat as a sack of any other
kind.
   Marshes once protected oysters in the Mississippi Sound by
acting as a natural buffer between salt water and fresh water.
Barge canals through marshes and the channelization of rivers and
bayous has sent flood waters directly into the Sound. These sudden
pulses of fresh water kill oysters.
   In 1983, flood waters rushed through the Bonnet Carre Spillway
and into the Mississippi Sound, destroying nearly 4,000 acres of
oyster reefs. In 1986, a drought left the Sound saltier, which made
conditions ripe for snails called oyster drills to wipe out the
harvest.
   While clam shells have been planted in the Mississippi Sound
this year to provide a base for young oysters to grow on, many feel
the salvation of the oyster industry is four years away. A proposed
$62 million spillway along the Bonnet Carre Spillway could allow a
regulated flow of fresh water into the Mississippi Sound.
   If estimates are correct, this U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
project could increase oyster production to 3.8 million pounds a
year by restoring the flow of fresh water through the marshes of
Louisiana and into the Mississippi Sound.
   But even with this freshwater regulator, droughts, floods and
pollution could continue to kill oysters.
   ``Basically, I believe you're talking Mother Nature,'' said John
Cirino, a biotechnician at Gulf Coast Research Laboratory. Cirino
is coordinating the Bureau of Marine Resources (BMR) shellfish
program.
   ``In the last 10 years we've had three major floods and three
years of high salinity and in between, three years of good
production,'' he said.

   Emperor Hirohito sent his thanks Monday to millions
of Japanese who have offered prayers since he fell ill with
intestinal bleeding.
   Police, meanwhile, reported that anti-monarchists defaced a
Shinto shrine.
   ``Please convey my gratitude,'' Hirohito was quoted as telling
Imperial Household Agency chief Shoichi Fujimori, who briefly
visited the 87-year-old monarch and later briefed reporters.
   Three weeks after the longest reigning monarch vomited blood
Sept. 19, the agency said more than 1.3 million well-wishers have
signed its registers praying for his recovery. Millions more have
signed registers at other government offices.
   Police in southern Fukuoka Prefecture said vandals splashed red
paint around a register at a Shinto shrine and scattered leaflets
reading, ``Eradicate the monarchy now!''
   The leaflets were signed by the Revolutionary Workers'
Association, a leftist fringe group that last week defaced a sign
at the burial mound of Japan's first emperor.
   In Tokyo, police at the Imperial Palace briefly detained a
student who tried to put up a poster accusing the government of
using Hirohito's illness to fan sentiment for military expansion.
   Hirohito received another blood transfusion Monday, bringing the
total he has received since Sept. 19 to nearly 14 pints of blood.
   Palace spokesman Kenji Maeda said the emperor's doctors did not
believe the intestinal hemorrhage had ceased. News reports said
doctors plan daily transfusions to combat continuing anemia.

   Rebels in southern Sudan today claimed
they killed 62 government soldiers and captured a small town during
a three-day battle.
   The clandestine radio of the Sudan People's Liberation Army said
in a report monitored in Nairobi that 300 soldiers fled to nearby
Uganda when its guerillas captured Ikotos town in eastern
Equatorial Province on Friday.
   ``SPLA fighters have taken positions on the Sudanese side, but
because of the respect we have for international borders we cannot
cross into Uganda,'' the radio said. ``We urge the fugitives to
surrender. If they surrender without their arms, no harm will be
done to them.''
   The radio made no mention of rebel casualties, and it was not
possible to independently verify its report.
   The Sudan People's Liberation Army took up arms in 1983 against
the Moslem-dominated government in Khartoum, demanding more
autonomy for the mainly Christian and animist south. The rebel
movement claims control of 90 percent of the southern countryside
and small towns.
   Thousands of civilians fleeing the war and the food shortages it
has caused have headed to larger towns such as Juba or to northern
Sudan, but relief officials say many have starved to death on the
way.

   Czechoslovak Premier Lubomir
Strougal, who headed the federal government for more than 18 years,
and Slovak Premier Peter Colotka resigned today, the state news
agency CTK reported.
   The announcement was made by Communist Party chief Milos Jakes
in a speech at a plenary session of the party's Central Committee.
   He said the resignations were accepted.
   Strougal, believed to be the longest-serving premier in Europe,
replaced Oldrich Cernik in January 1970.
   Colotka has served as Slovak premier since May 1969 and as
Czechoslovak deputy premier since September 1969.
   Czechoslovakia consists of two republics of equal rights, the
Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic.
   Each is governed by a National Council, which delegates to an
overall Federal Assembly responsibility for constitutional and
foreign affairs, defense and important economic decisions.
   The primary source of power in Czechoslovakia is the Communist
Party.
   The shake-up in Czechoslovakia follows similar government
reorganizations in the Soviet Union, Hungary and Poland.
   In his speech, Jakes also said changes were made in the
top-ruling Politburo, the party secretariat, the Central Committee
itself and federal, Czech and Slovak governments. However, he did
not name the effected officials.
   Jakes was quoted as saying the proposed changes, ``proceed from
the need for a new deployment of leading cadres in the intereest of
mastering the demanding tasks of economic and social
restructuring.''
   There have long been rumors about top-level changes in
Czechoslovakia and Jakes and other officials indicated for some
time that younger people would be promoted to senior positions.
   In remarks winding up a two-day session of the Central Committee
on April 9, Jakes said the leadership wanted ``to elevate younger
comrades, and thus create conditions for further successful
fulfillment of party tasks.''
   He then also said it was ``an important requirement to ensure
that qualified young people are more frequently proposed'' for key
economic and other jobs.
   At today's meeting, opening a two-day plenary session on
ideology, Jakes also proposed that the next party congress be moved
forward by one year and take place in 1990.
   Jakes also made clear that unlike in neighboring Hungary
independent human rights, ecological and other groups would not be
allowed to operate.
   He warned that formation and operation of ``anti-Socialist
political structures'' will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted.
   The meeting was called a week after the Communist party's ruling
presidium, or Politburo, met Wednesday to discuss personnel changes
amid speculation that Politburo member Vasil Bilak, who has long
held the key ideology portfolio, may also retire.
   A fellow ideologist, Jan Fojtik, was promoted to the ruling
Politburo in April and has appeared increasingly to oversee the
important function.
   Fojtik's promotion was one of the few changes made in
Czechoslovakia's top leadership since Milos Jakes replaced
President Gustav Husak as Communist party leader in December.
   The CTK news agency earlier reported the meeting would discuss
an ``evaluation'' of conclusions from two recent party sessions and
the ``tasks of ideological work of the party in the conditions of
restructuring.''
   In a highly surprising article carried by the party daily Rude
Pravo last week, a senior party official called for ``resolute
condemnation of egocentrism, the wish to stand at the head of the
party ... as long as possible and thus to prevent the younger
generation from enganging in decision-making.''
   Rudolf Hegenbart, who heads a Central Committee department
responsible for state administration, demanded accountability of
all leading cadres and ``more personal courage in admitting that `I
am no longer able to carry on the entrusted office.'''
   Most Czechoslovak leaders are well into their sixties, and some,
such as President Husak and Federal Assembly (Parliament) president
Alois Indra were known to be ailing or gravely ill.
   ``The working people want to elect representatives whom they
trust and not those who twist and turn like a weather wane when the
so-called new wind starts to blow (or) those who bear
responsibility for having brought the economy and other social
sectors into critical situations and yet call today for new
principles of management,'' Hegenbart told Rude Pravo.

<TEXT>
   The NAACP National Board is planning a
nationwide get-out-the-vote campaign keyed to the 25th anniversary
of the murder of Mississippi civil rights leader Medgar Evers.
   Posters featuring Evers, which are being distributed across the
country to chapters of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People, will be officially unveiled during the the
board's meeting here Thursday through Saturday, said Earl
Shinhoster, NAACP regional director from Atlanta.
   ``Black voters can make a significant difference if they turn
out in record numbers for the Nov. 8 election. Those records are
going to have to be higher than 1984's,'' Shinhoster said in an
interview Monday. ``We really believe we need to have 70 to 80
percent black voter turnout to make a difference in the election.''
   He said an estimated 45 percent to 60 percent of blacks
nationwide voted in the 1984 presidential election.
   The NAACP hopes blacks can be the decisive bloc in the
presidential race between Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts and
Vice President George Bush.
   Though the NAACP doesn't formally endorse candidates, Shinhoster
said in a recent news release, ``This year's presidential election
provides a clear and unmistakable choice between the politics of
Reaganomics and Reaganism and the politics of hope and
opportunity.''
   The posters featuring photographs of Evers, Mississippi's first
NAACP field secretary who was slain on June 12, 1963, state: ``On
Tuesday, Nov. 8, 1988, help us fulfill Medgar Evers' goals.''
   Those goals are listed as equal opportunity, fair housing
practice, justice and human rights, adequate health care, job
opportunities and better schools.
   No one was ever convicted of the ambush slaying of the
37-year-old Evers outside his Jackson home. Byron De La Beckwith
was charged with the shooting but two trials ended with deadlocked
juries.

   The army opened fire with machineguns on
demonstrators in western Algiers today, killing at least 25 people
and wounding dozens more, witnesses said.
   The gunfire occurred in Bab-el-Oued, a district in western
Algiers, as 10,000 people responded to a call by the Islamic
fundamentalists for a ``peaceful march of protest.''
   An Islamic group said more than 250 people have died in weeklong
anti-government protests against high prices and the economic
policies of President Chadli Bendjedid.
   ``There were bodies lying on all sides,'' one witness at
Bab-el-Oued reported. ``The soldiers were piling them into trucks,
one body on top of another.''
   The witness and others reported several dozen people were
injured and taken away in ambulances. They spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   One participant reported seeing the body of a teenager wrapped
in a sheet and taken away by friends. Other witnesses spoke of at
least 25 and perhaps 30 dead in the latest outbreak of violence.
   No official death toll has been issued in the riots, the worst
in this North African nation since its independence from France in
1962.
   The Movement for Algerian Renewal, an Islamic fundamentalist
group that claims to lead the demonstrations, reported 256 dead
since Tuesday, and 600 injured. Hospital and police sources have
said about 200 have died, with several hundred wounded.
   Bendjedid prepared to address the nation tonight about the
crisis.
   The army fired volleys of machine-gun fire into the air today to
disperse the march from Belcourt, three miles to the east of
Bab-el-Oued, which violated regulations under the state of
emergency declared Thursday.
   The demonstrators split up and many went to Bab-el-Oued, where
troops fired into the crowd, according to witnesses.
   Riots also have occurred in the western port city of Oran to
Annaba in the east and a dozen provincial centers, said Interior
Minister El Hadi Khediri, appearing on state television over the
weekend.
   ``We have tried in vain to stop the troubles,'' Khediri said.
   Earlier today, the city of Algiers was calm. Most shops reopened
in downtown Algiers and traffic moved. Troops and tanks were posted
at main intersections and at the harbor.
   Clashes between the army and rioters spread late Saturday and
early Sunday in Algiers as protesters defied a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
curfew and a ban on demonstrations.
   Kouba, on the southern fringes of Algiers, apparently suffered
the largest number of dead and injured. Hospital sources reported
more than 60 people killed when the army, according to witnesses,
fired into a crowd after it repeatedly ignored calls to disperse.
   Unrest began about 10 days ago with non-violent strikes
demanding higher wages to keep up with inflation.
   Algeria's annual unemployment rate is estimated at 40 percent
and food prices have risen by at least 40 percent since January.
But the government has vowed to stick to an austerity plan prompted
in part by the falling price of oil, the nation's main export.
   At Mustapha Hospital in Algiers, physicians moved patients out
of the hospital to make room for the hundreds of injured
demonstrators.
   ``It's terrible. Beirut. Like Beirut. The same thing,'' said a
French citizen arriving Sunday in Paris on Air Algeria's only
scheduled flight of the day. He was interviewed on French
television. He was not identified.
   The Islamic movement on Sunday demanded removal of the
president, Interior Minister Khediri and the head of the ruling
National Liberation Front Party, Mohamed Cherif Messaadia.
   The movement came to public attention Saturday when it demanded
cheaper food and the dismantling of the political apparatus.

   Negotiators have moved closer to an agreement
to withdraw 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola over 24 to 30 months in
a tradeoff for South Africa granting independence to neighboring
Namibia, U.S. officials said Monday.
   ``The gap has been substantially narrowed,'' an official told
The Associated Press.
   While no final deal was struck in weekend talks in New York,
Cuban officials suggested they were willing to step up the pace of
withdrawal from the 2,000 a month they had proposed, said the
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   South Africa had demanded that 8,000 a month quit Angola, where
the Cubans are helping a Soviet-backed government defend itself
against guerrillas armed by the United States and South Africa.
   The Cuban officials also indicated they were willing to step up
the pace of withdrawing the 16,000 to 18,000 troops stationed near
the border with Namibia, or South-West Africa, the U.S. sources
said.
   The twin issues have been major sticking points in working out a
settlement.
   But the U.S. officials said negotiators would have to meet again
and that ``further significant decisions will be required'' before
a final agreement was concluded.
   The talks were held over the weekend and involved officials from
Angola, Cuba, South Africa and the United States.
   There already was a tentative understanding that the Cuban
troops would withdraw over 24 to 30 months. Some trainers will
remain behind to assist the Angolan forces fight the guerrillas.
   However, the question was whether the withdrawal would be
``front-end-loaded'' _ a sizable pullout in the early stages to
make the retreat irreversible _ and how quickly the troops near the
Namibian border would leave.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said further
talks would be held soon but that it may not be possible to reach
the Nov. 1 deadline set by the United Nations for transition to
independence for Namibia.
   In Johannesburg, Roland Darroll, a Foreign Affairs spokesman,
said South Africa, Cuba and Angola had agreed that Cuban troops
should be withdrawn from Angola within 24 to 30 months.
   ``That was the agreement in Brazzaville, (Congo). It was subject
to consultation with the governments,'' Darroll said.
   He said he had no further information.
   South Africa has linked its willingness to cooperate with a
one-year independence plan for Namibia, which it rules, to the
withdrawal of the Cuban troops. The Pretoria government pulled its
soldiers out of Namibia earlier this year and says Cuba's forces
threaten the territory's independence.
   Diplomats involved in the talks had said they were working
toward reaching agreement on a Cuban withdrawal timetable at a
formal meeting to be held sometime later this month in Congo.
   That meeting will be crucial because the negotiators are running
out of time to achieve a compromise before Nov. 1. South Africa has
suggested that date for putting into effect the U.N.'s independence
plan for Namibia.

   Republican George Bush and running mate Dan
Quayle, a home-grown senator, hold a double-digit lead over
Democrat Michael Dukakis among Indiana voters, according to a new
presidential poll released Monday.
   The survey of more than 1,000 registered voters showed Bush with
47.6 percent support, compared with 31 percent for Dukakis and 21
percent still undecided.
   The Hoosier state controls 12 electoral votes in the November
presidential election.
   The 1988 Election Poll was conducted Oct. 6-9 by the Public
Opinion Laboratory at Indiana University-Purdue University at
Indianapolis and has a 3 percent margin of error.

   Four years after the Irish Republican Army blew up
her seaside convention hotel, Margaret Thatcher and her
Conservative Party reassembled Monday in the same place with the
political fundamentals unchanged.
   Arriving in Brighton on the eve of the four-day convention, Mrs.
Thatcher gazed at the repaired facade of the Grand Hotel and said
her strongest memory from the Oct. 12, 1984, bombing was that the
day after, the convention started on time and ``people flooded in.
They weren't going to be defeated.''
   The IRA, in a statement to the Irish media, said it ``takes
great delight from the hysteria and the expense surrounding the
security of Mrs. Thatcher and the Tories at their Brighton
conference.''
   The British leader and the IRA remain pledged to wiping each
other out. She is Britain's longest continuously serving prime
minister this century, while the IRA's bomb-and-bullet campaign to
drive Britain out of Northern Ireland has become one of the longest
on-and-off wars of the century.
   Mrs. Thatcher said she chose to return to the graceful old
Victorian hotel because ``after the incident last time we could not
possibly have stayed anywhere else.''
   So far this year, 81 people have been killed in Northern
Ireland, compared with 93 in 1987. And a new IRA campaign against
British servicemen has cost five lives in England and continental
Europe this year.
   What has changed irrevocably is the atmosphere of British
political party conventions since the bomb ripped through the
eight-story Grand Hotel in the south England resort. Five people
were killed and 30 injured.
   Mrs. Thatcher emerged unscathed, having left the bathroom of her
suite two minutes before falling masonry demolished it. ``Today we
were unlucky,'' said an IRA statement. ``But remember, we have only
to be lucky once _ you will always have to be lucky.''
   ``Terrorism will never win,'' riposted Mrs. Thatcher.
   Until the bombing, Tory party conventions were relaxed affairs.
Reporters, delegates, lobbyists and bystanders rubbed shoulders
with Cabinet ministers in lobbies and bars. Guards at the entrances
merely glanced at identity badges.
   As the Tories returned for the first time since 1984, however,
more than 2,000 police have been mobilized to provide security.
   Sidewalks, mail boxes and sewers around the hotel and adjacent
conference center are sealed off, overflights by civil aircraft are
banned, and a Royal Navy destroyer patrols offshore.
   In a $2.6 million operation codenamed Radcot, bomb experts and
dogs have scoured the Grand Hotel, where Mrs. Thatcher and many of
her 22-member Cabinet are staying again for the four-day conference.
   Police have checked more than 50,000 Brighton hotel guests,
staff and residents.
   ``We assess the level of risk, quite clearly, as very high,''
said Sussex county police Chief Constable Roger Birch.
   But Richard Ingrams, a columnist in the liberal Observer
newspaper, wrote: ``This expensive farce is a great tribute to the
IRA.'' He said the security measures were ``so extreme and so alien
to our way of life (that) it is worth wondering whether in fact
terrorism has not already won.''
   The IRA statement recalled that Mrs. Thatcher was saying seven
years ago that the IRA was finished, and added: ``The British
public can now judge for themselves how safe their prime minister
feels when she has to surround herself with the Royal Navy, the
Royal Air Force, the Special Air Services, the Special Boat
Service, the British army and a police force.''
   The bomb killed lawmaker Sir Anthony Berry; Lancashire Tory area
director Eric Taylor; Jean Shattock, wife of another regional
official; Roberta Wakeham, wife of the parliamentary chief whip;
and Muriel MacLean, wife of the president of the Scottish
Conservative Association.
   It also indirectly cost Mrs. Thatcher one of her closest Cabinet
allies, Norman Tebbit, who had to quit active politics and go into
business in order to pay for the care of his wife, Margaret, who
was paralyzed for life by the explosion.
   Tebbit was Trade and Industry Secretary at the time of the
bombing and then party chairman before resigning this year.
   Patrick Magee, the IRA man who is serving a life sentence for
the five murders, planted the 20- to 30-pound time-bomb behind the
wall panels of a bedroom four floors above Mrs. Thatcher's suite.
   Magee checked into the Grand Hotel under a false name a month
before the convention and was traced after police painstakingly
combed the hotel's register and questioned hundreds of previous
guests.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who turns 63 on Thursday, was elected in 1979 and
won an unprecedented third consecutive term last year.
   Unlike the opposition Labor Party, which ended its convention
last week deeply divided over how to reverse its repeated defeats,
the Tories look more united than ever before.
   Also unlike Labor, the Tories do not make policy at their
conventions, and this year's gathering is expected simply to
endorse a continuation of Mrs. Thatcher's free-market economics,
hawkish foreign policy and tough stance on law and order.
   The Conservatives command 45 percent support in opinion polls,
five points ahead of Labor, and Mrs. Thatcher remains the choice of
61 percent of Britons as the most effective leader on offer.

<HEAD>Dukakis Unveils Housing Program</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LEVITTOWN, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis, bidding for the support of young middle class voters,
proposed Monday allowing first-time home buyers to use up to
$10,000 of their IRAs for a down payment.
   While outlining his housing proposal, Dukakis also sounded an
optimistic note in the face of polls showing him trailing
Republican George Bush. He told a partisan crowd at Gen. Douglas
MacArthur High School, ``This one is out there to be won. You know
it and I know it.
   ``We can taste it; we can feel it.''
   Dukakis spoke in one of the communities that came to symbolize
the post-World War II home-building boom and recalled bipartisan
efforts to ``promise to provide affordable housing for all
Americans.''
   He said the Reagan administration ``broke that promise in the
early 1980s.''
   From Levittown, Dukakis went to midtown Manhattan to march in
the annual Columbus Day parade.
   With New York Gov. Mario Cuomo at his side and Mayor Edward Koch
just behind him, Dukakis walked up Fifth Avenue on a clear cool day
to the cheers of a largely friendly crowd.
   John F. Kennedy Jr., who was on crutches after breaking his foot
in a bicycling accident, marched part of the way with Dukakis.
   Red, white and blue Dukakis-Bentsen signs lined the route,
punctuated only rarely by Bush placards.
   While Dukakis appeared to have the parade crowd on his side,
Bush received the endorsement of Il Progresso, the nation's largest
Italian language daily newspaper.
   Bush supporters passed out copies of the newspaper which said,
``The traditional values of Italian-Americans can be found in the
electoral program of Vice President Bush.''
   After the parade, Dukakis was returning to Boston to resume
preparations for his second and last debate with Bush.
   ``I'm looking forward very, very much to that debate on Thursday
night,'' he told the audience at the Gen. Douglas MacArthur High
School.
   ``This is a tight race, folks, and it's getting tighter every
day,'' he said. Then, in a reference to the vice presidential
debate between his running mate Lloyd Bentsen and the Republican
nominee Dan Quayle, Dukakis said, ``And the events of the last week
have tightened it up some more.''
   As usual, he laced his speech with disparaging references to
Quayle.
   ``George Bush and his friends are satisfied,'' he said. ``They
say all is well. They believe Dan Quayle is the only cloud on their
horizon. Dan Quayle is more than just a cloud, he's a major storm
system. ... This is one storm the American people can avoid.''
   Dukakis dubbed his housing proposal ``Home START'' and said it
was ``aimed at giving families a chance to buy their first home _ a
start on the ladder of opportunity and security that homeownership
represents.''
   He said it was ``a simple solution. No new bureaucracies, no red
tape. Whyat it will do is permit first-time homebuyers to invest
their IRA savings or their tax-deferred pension plans to make
downpayments on their homes.''
   Myles Lynk, a Dukakis adviser who worked on formulating the
proposal, said there would be a $10,000 cap on the amount that
could be withdrawn from Individual Retirement Accounts.
   ``We don't want to create an incentive to liquidate IRAs,'' he
said.
   In addition, Dukakis would reduce the down payment required for
federally insured mortgages.
   Lynk said the principal cost of the home ownership plan would be
the estimated $400 million loss in tax revenue resulting from the
increased incentive for people to contribute to Individual
Retirement Accounts.

<HEAD>Pentagon Searching For Ways To Hold Down Dropout Rate Among
Recruits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The numbers that Pentagon planners had been
crunching led them to predict that if more high school graduates
enlisted in the all-volunteer Armed Forces, fewer would drop out
before completing their service.
   So they were a little surprised to find that starting in 1979,
although more recruits had high school diplomas, more of them were
dropping out.
   Defense Department officials have already implemented one
solution, telling drill sergeants to ease up on recruits at boot
camp. And they are preparing a detailed questionnaire, to be
introduced as early as next October, that they hope will enable
them to forecast more accurately the type of recruit most likely to
persevere.
   According to analysis by the Defense Department and the RAND
Corp., the tale begins with a pay raise that had the desired result
of attracting more people into the Armed Forces, said Steven
Sellman, director of accession policy in the Pentagon's personnel
policy office.
   The surge in recruits caused a change in the attitudes of
trainers at boot camps, he said.
   ``In 1980, the number of recruits went up. Trainers in the boot
camps thought, `there are a lot of people queuing up, wanting to
get in,' so sensitivity was low'' to the problems of enlistees,
said Sellman.
   ``In the 1980s, there was not the same kind of sensitivity to
people as in the 1970s, when recruitment was low'' and boot camp
trainers were willing to counsel recruits who were having problems,
he said.
   The word went out to the boot camps to lighten up. And the
dropout rate dropped.
   The Pentagon wants to retain well-educated recruits because
training, processing and replacing each dropout costs $18,000,
Sellman said in an interview.
   ``So, reducing the dropout rate even by 1 percent can mean big
bucks,'' he said.
   Pentagon officials also want to assure a steady flow of
well-educated recruits to handle the increasingly sophisticated
weaponry of the high-technology battlefield.
   A RAND report, written by Richard Buddin, found that from the
beginning of fiscal 1980 through the end of 1983, ``the percentage
of high-quality (recruits) rose from 28 percent to 49 percent for
men and from 33 percent to 66 percent for women, but the six-month
attrition rate also rose 0.9 and 1.5 percentage points for men and
women.''
   For the Army, RAND found, the six-month attrition rate for men
rose from 6.6 percent in fiscal 1979 to 10.9 percent in fiscal 1985.
   After new policies were introduced, providing greater counseling
for troubled recruits, the attrition rates went back down, to 7.2
percent.
   Attrition rates for ``high-quality'' recruits vary from base to
base, with the highest levels consistently at Fort Jackson, next to
Columbia, S.C., and the lowest at Fort Bliss, near El Paso, Texas,
and Fort McClellan, near Anniston, Ala.
   Despite the improvements, said Sellman, ``we are still dabbling
with the recruitment profile.'' That includes asking RAND to review
the records of thousands of recruits to determine why they dropped
out.
   At the same time, Sellman and his associates are working on a
long questionnaire they hope will give them a better handle on the
kinds of people likely to fulfill their service contracts.
   The questions ask potential recruits about such issues as
previous work, trouble with authorities, drug or alcohol use,
problems in high school, grades, and the types of courses taken.
   ``People in academic programs tend to have a little more
stick-to-itness than people who followed a vocational program,''
said Sellman.
   The answers will be compared to those given by earlier recruits
who finished their enlistment, he said. The questionnaires, which
will take about 30 minutes to fill out, may be introduced by
October 1989.
   Introducing the questionnaire will add an additional index to
the two the Armed Forces have used since the beginning of the
all-volunteer force to measure the ``quality'' of recruits: whether
they received a high school diploma and how they scored on the
Armed Forces Qualification Test.
   Previously, said Sellman, ``the biggest predictor has been the
high school degree. Recruits with high school degrees are twice as
likely to make it.''

<HEAD>Two of Fugitive's Foreign Bank Accounts Reported Frozen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have frozen two foreign bank accounts
belonging to a fugitive financial planner who was captured in
Japan, spurring hopes that clients may be able to recover some of
the $20 million reported missing.
   Court-appointed receiver James Feltman said Monday he filed
lawsuits freezing Henry Gherman's bank accounts in two countries.
The Miami accountant said investigators were preparing to freeze a
third foreign account.
   Feltman said the freezing of the accounts increases the
likelihood that a substantial amount of the missing money will be
recovered, and Allen said Gherman's arrest over the weekend ``will
only help the case.''
   Both Feltman and his attorney, Richard Allen, refused to
identify the countries where Gherman's accounts were found, but
they said the countries are known for strict banking secrecy laws.
   Details of Gherman's financial arrangements could alert the
money manager's associates, Fletman and Allen said, and allow them
to empty the accounts before pending court actions are resolved.
   The FBI announced Saturday Gherman had been arrested in Tokyo.
   Gherman was sought on federal charges filed Aug. 29 of mail
fraud and embezzlement. He fled Miami two weeks earlier, leaving
notes of apology to his bilked investment clients.
   Up to 50 Miami-area investors, including several doctors and
nurses, may have lost as much as $20 million through Gherman over
the past decade.
   Feltman said the accounts frozen could hold anywhere from
hundreds of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars.
   ``But nothing has been verified,'' he said. ``We don't know
exactly how much because of the banking secrecy laws in those
countries, and that's making this stage of our investigation a very
thorny and delicate process.''
   Gherman is being held at Tokyo's Kosugi Prison in a detention
center for foreign prisoners. He is expected to face a preliminary
extradition hearing later this week, according to FBI spokesman
Paul Miller.
   Feltman said Japanese authorities have been asked if Gherman is
willing to cooperate in the investigation but have not responded
yet.
   Miller said Gherman first arrived in Taipei, Taiwan, on a
legitimate visa in his own name 11 days after fleeing Florida. He
subsequently registered at two Taipei hotels under his own name and
made numerous intercontinental telephone calls to the United States
using his own name. After U.S. authorities located him they
arranged for his expulsion to Japan.
   Feltman said the foreign bank accounts were traced through
records Gherman left at his North Miami Beach offices and through a
series of financial transactions the financial planner made before
his disappearance in August.

<HEAD>Harvey Arraigned On Tampering, Extortion Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who claimed he found a mouse in
a can of Coors beer pleaded innocent Monday to charges of extortion
and tampering.
   James N. Harvey, 30, was charged Sept. 27 with a state law that
prohibits tampering with consumer products and with extortion for
asking representatives of the Adolph Coors Co. for $35,000 in
exchange for the can of beer and the mouse.
   He remained free on bond and a pretrial hearing was scheduled
for Friday. If convicted of both counts, Harvey could face up to 30
years in prison.
   Harvey, a construction worker, claimed he purchased a can of
Coors on July 27 and discovered a mouse after taking a few swallows.
   On July 29, Harvey called the Coors' consumer hot line and
reported finding the rodent. Coors initially offered to pay $1,500
for the mouse and the can, but he refused and later asked for
$35,000.
   A judge later ordered Harvey to turn over both the mouse and the
can for testing.
   A University of Florida pathologist determined that, based on
the amount of decomposition, the rodent could not have been in the
can when it was packaged on May 13. That conclusion, however, was
disputed by a pathologist hired by Gary Pajcic, an attorney
representing Harvey at the time.
   Harvey is charged with violating the state statute of consumer
product tampering, enacted in 1987 following cases involving
pain-reliever capsules, including Tylenol, said Assistant State
Attorney E. McRae Mathis.
   The statute carries a maximum sentence of 15 years and a $5,000
fine. The extortion count also carries a 15-year prison term.
   Coors has sued Harvey claiming that he defamed the company's
product and attempted to defraud the company.
   Coors, based in Golden, Colo., claims it has spent $500,000
defending its reputation as a result of the adverse publicity, and
the local Coors distributor, Neal Tyler and Sons Inc., said it has
lost $100,000 in sales.

   Newlyweds were booked into the Lorain County
Jail on their wedding night after being arrested in a drunken fight
with each other, a bystander and police, authorities said Monday.
   Roger McGee, 28, and Tamara Lynn McGee, 19, were married
Saturday afternoon.
   About 10 hours later, early Sunday, the Lorain Police Department
says it received a report that Mrs. McGee had been assaulted.
   When police arrived at the couple's home, they discovered McGee
fighting with Miles Burch, 28, also of Lorain, said patrolman
Raymond West. According to a police report, Burch said he was
attempting to help Mrs. McGee.
   When police tried to break up the fight, both McGees fought with
officers and had to be handcuffed, police said. Once in a police
car, McGee tried to kick out the rear window, the police report
said.
   Mrs. McGee had an asthma attack at the jail and was taken to St.
Joseph Hospital and Health Center, where a hospital spokesman said
she had to be put in restraints before she could be treated. She
was returned to the jail after treatment but was taken to the
hospital again because of another asthma attack, police said.
   McGee was released from jail Monday after pleading no contest to
resisting arrest, said municipal court clerk Cindy Paysor. Charges
of disorderly conduct and disorderly conduct while intoxicated were
merged into that count, she said.
   Municipal Judge V. Paul Timko sentenced McGee to 10 days in jail
and ordered him to pay $250 and court costs, but suspended the jail
time and all but $50 of the fine and the court costs, Ms. Paysor
said.
   Mrs. McGee was released Sunday on $700 bond, Ms. Paysor said.
She was charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct while
intoxicated. Reached by phone Monday, she declined comment.
   Burch was released on $50 bond Sunday and pleaded innocent to
charges of disorderly conduct and persisting in the conduct after
police told him to stop. He is not listed in the telephone
directory and couldn't be reached for comment.

   The Inter American Press Association has
sent a formal protest to Chilean President Augusto Pinochet
condemning police attacks on reporters covering anti-government
demonstrations.
   The note, sent Sunday, said IAPA ``is shocked and outraged by
the brutal attacks on journalists last Thursday, Friday and
Saturday following the presidential plebiscite in your country.''
   The message was signed by IAPA President Ignacio E. Lozano Jr.
and Wilbur G. Landrey, chairman of the Freedom of Press and
Information Committee.
   ``It is difficult to believe that these attacks were isolated,
spontaneous actions, especially in the circumstances in which they
took place at a time when Chileans had just voted their
preferences,'' the statement said.
   Pinochet had just lost an election in which the people voted
whether they wanted him to continue as president for another
eight-year term.
   At its Salt Lake meeting, IAPA is compiling a country-by-country
report on the status of press freedom in the hemisphere, and
Landrey said he received the Chile report Saturday night in a cable
from Emilio Filippi, director of the opposition paper La Epoca.

   A judge on Monday ordered CBS Records to turn
over the master tape of the rock group Judas Priest's ``Stained
Class'' album so it can be examined for subliminal messages that
may have prompted two teen-agers to enter into a suicide pact.
   CBS ``has not been completely cooperating with discovery in this
case,'' Washoe District Court Judge Jerry Whitehead said before
delaying trial of a lawsuit against the group and giving the
company 30 days to hand over the master tape.
   CBS has told plaintiffs in the lawsuit it cannot find the
24-track master tape for the 1978 album. The judge said the tape
would be a key piece of evidence in separating sounds among the
music and lyrics to determine whether any subliminal messages exist.
   Without evidence of subliminal messages, Whitehead said the case
would not go to trial since music and lyrics are protected by the
First Amendment right to free speech.
   If subliminal messages are found within the ``Stained Class''
album, Whitehead said the trial would concentrate on whether such
hidden communication deserves the same First Amendment protection.
   ``The court did not believe that it was automatic that the First
Amendment protects the right to subliminal speech,'' Whitehead said.
   The case is the first of its kind to advance this far in an
American court.
   Judas Priest members weren't present in the courtroom Monday.
   In 1986, the families of Raymond Belknap and James Vance, both
of nearby Sparks, filed suit claiming the music, words and
subliminal messages in the album drove the two into a suicide pact.
   After listening to ``Stained Class'' for six hours, drinking
alcohol and smoking marijuana, Belknap, 18, killed himself with a
shotgun two days before Christmas 1985. Vance, then 19, shot and
seriously injured himself with the same shotgun.
   Reno attorney Suellen Fulstone, who represents the band members,
said neither her clients nor CBS has possession of the master tape
and CBS used a two-track tape dub to record the album.
   ``We have not been able to locate it,'' Ms. Fulstone said
outside the courtroom. ``I don't know how we're going to comply
with the court's order.''
   Attorney Kenneth McKenna, representing Belknap's mother Aunuette
Roberson of Reno, scoffed at that claim.
   ``I have never believed that the master tape was unavailable,''
he said, adding he has found some subliminal messages on the album
but might discover more if the master tape were used. McKenna
refused to reveal the content of the alleged subliminal messages he
heard.

   Officials in eight Northeastern states are

   Fifteen cities or rural areas in the region have been named by
the Environmental Protection Agency as failing to meet its ozone
standard. Eleven cities violate the standard for carbon monoxide,
most of which comes from motor vehicles. Metropolitan New York is
the nation's worst offender for carbon monoxide and third worst for
ozone.
   The eight states _ New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode
Island, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont _ already
are implementing regulations to reduce gasoline volatility in the
summertime, starting next year, in an attempt to lower smog levels.
   Air pollution directors of those states are slated to discuss
the ``California plan'' again this week before formally proposing
regional adoption, according to Michael Bradley, executive director
of the Boston-based Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use
Management. Environmental officials in Vermont, Massachusetts and
New York have authority to proceed without legislative approval, he
said.
   Experts agree that much of the ozone at any point on the
northeastern seaboard originates with pollution upwind in the
Boston-Washington megapolis, and it is practically impossible for
any state to control the problem by itself.
   An EPA gasoline regulation, expected to be issued later this
year, would not lower volatility to the new NESCAUM level until
1992. Gasoline vapors help form ozone, the major component of smog.
The more volatile the fuel, the more vapor that escapes and the
more smog that is formed.
   Few states have been willing to get out in front of the federal
government on initiatives against air pollution, with California
the most notable exception.
   California pioneered auto air pollution controls in the 1960s
and the Clean Air Act of 1970 gave the state the right to impose
stricter requirements than the federal standards for the rest of
the country.
   To avoid the confusion of 50 potentially different standards,
Congress said no other state could develop its own plan _ but any
state, with EPA's permission, may adopt the entire set of
California regulations. So far, none has.
   According to NESCAUM, the regional adoption of the California
standards would cut emissions of the three principal auto
pollutants _ carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and gasoline vapor _
by 50 percent within 15 years, as the car and truck fleets are
replaced with models with superior pollution controls.
   ``One of the questions we're researching is, are we buying into
future revisions of the California standards?'' Bradley said.
   The assessment, though, is ``extremely favorable to air
quality,'' and ``My directors have said, `Let's go forward.'''
   The move likely means the elimination of the entire fleet of
light-duty diesel vehicles, and the emission requirements could
mean a slightly higher pricetag for gasoline-powered cars and
trucks. California models look the same, except for required
dashboard indicators tied to pollution control components.
   California exhausts may contain only 40 percent of the nitrogen
oxides and 64 percent of the unburned gasoline permitted elsewhere.
California permits twice as much carbon monoxide as the federal
standard, but is planning to bring that limit down to the federal
level.
   The auto industry has built cars to the California standards
since the mid-1970s, although they don't like building two versions
of the same car. California accounts for 11 percent of the national
auto market.
   The eight Northeastern states account for 13 percent of the
market.
   For some makes of cars, only the California version is built and
it is marketed nationwide. All basic models are offered in
California, but some engine-transmission combinations may not be
available there.
   Bradley said NESCAUM had discussed its intention with the Motor
Vehicle Manufacturers Association and MVMA had not raised any
concerns. Ann Carlson of MVMA's Washington office said, ``I don't
know that we've taken a position.''
   Bill Noack of General Motors Corp. said he was unable to locate
any executives who were aware of NESCAUM's plans.
   According to the EPA, the cities or areas in the eight states
which have violated the carbon monoxide standard are, in descending
order of severity, New York City; Hartford, Conn.; Manchester,
N.H.; Nassau-Suffolk, N.Y.; Syracuse, N.Y.; Nashua, New Hampshire,
Newark, N.J.; Springfield, Mass; Bergen-Passaic, N.J.; Jersey City,
N.J.; and Boston.
   Those identified as failing to meet the ozone standard are New
York City and suburbs, a Connecticut-Massachusetts area including
the cities of Springfield, Mass., and Bristol, Hartford,
Middletown, New Britain, New Haven and New London in Connecticut;
Providence, R.I.; Knox County, Maine; York County, Maine; Atlantic
City, N.J.; Boston; New Bedford, Mass.; Portland, Maine; Hancock
County, Maine; Jefferson County, New York; Lincoln County, Maine;
Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Worcester, Mass.; and Kennebunk County,
Maine.

   Acid rain, ozone depletion and the greenhouse
warming are related to one another and must be faced together _ not
as three separate problems _ an environmental researcher said
Monday.
   The three widely discussed climate problems are related
chemically, and their effects are related economically, Irving
Mintzer of the World Resources Institute reported.
   Mankind ``must begin to think comprehensively about these
problems and deal with them,'' he told the opening session of The
Global Greenhouse Network First International Conference.
   The title of the meeting comes from the ``greenhouse effect,'' a
warming of the Earth that scientists say appears to have begun as a
result of increasing carbon dioxide and other chemicals released
into the air.
   Some researchers have speculated that the greenhouse effect may
have been a factor in this summer's extraordinarily hot, dry
weather, although most say they are unsure as yet.
   While conference participants concentrated on the dangers of the
greenhouse warming, Minzter pointed out that chlorofluorocarbons,
one of the chemicals blamed for the warming, also damage the
Earth's ozone layer when they reach high altitudes. These chemicals
are widely used in refrigeration and other processes. International
efforts are underway to reduce their use.
   Ozone helps deflect damaging radiation from the sun, and
depletion of this shield could lead to a rise in skin cancer, among
other problems, scientists fear.
   Burning of fossil fuels produces, in addition to carbon dioxide,
sulfur and nitrogen compounds which can dissolve in the water vapor
in the air, causing the rainfall to become more acidic. That
damages trees and other plants and can even kill fish in
increasingly acidic lakes.
   Getting control of this set of linked problems means dealing
with both complex scientific issues and finding ways to coordinate
the policies of the nations of the world, Mintzer said.
   Already the world's temperature has increased slightly, and is
likely to continue doing so, he said, and work needs to begin on
finding ways to slow down the rate of climate change.
   The average telperature of the Earth is about 0.5 degree Celsius
(0.8 degree Fahrenheit) warmer than a century ago, an increase
which has been attributed to the carbon dioxide released from coal
and other fuels being burned.
   At current rates that could rise another 1.5 degrees to 4.5
degrees by the year 2010, Mintzer said, while sincere efforts to
curtail release of gases could delay that warming until 2075 or so,
he said.
   While that warming doesn't sound like much, it would be greater
than any climate change in human history, Mintzer pointed out,
meaning there is no precedent for coping with such a shift.
   That kind of warming could have serious consequences for
agriculture, including a northward shift in croplands, increased
droughts and changes in which kinds of crops can be grown, said
Cynthia Rosenzweig of Columbia University and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space
Studies.
   Some climate change is ``probably inevitable'' she told the
conference, and urged both scientific and policy research on coping
with the changes that will come.
   The warming will also have serious consequences for beaches,
coastal wetlands and cities and towns along the coasts, added
Stephen P. Leatherman of the University of Maryland.
   Warmer temperatures can be expected to cause melting of some of
the global ice caps, raising sea levels and inundating many coastal
areas, he said.
   Worldwide sea levels have risen a half-foot during the last
century, Leatherman said, potentially threatening such modern
communities as Miami Beach, Fla. and Ocean City, Md., as well as
rural coastal marshes in Louisiana and Third World countries such
as Bangladesh.

   Il Progresso, the Italian-language newspaper, on
Monday endorsed the candidacy of George Bush for president, saying
the Republican represents ``the traditional values of Italian
Americans.''
   In its Columbus Day edition, the 85,000-circulation daily cited
Bush's stand against abortion and support for prayer in public
schools among its reasons for backing the vice president.
   Bush did not attend the Columbus Day parade, but his Democratic
opponent, Michael Dukakis, was among the marchers in the most
prominent event of the city's Italian community.
   Another marcher, Democratic Mayor Edward I. Koch, commented that
Il Progresso was ``a very good newspaper, but even Il Progresso is

   Added Gov. Mario Cuomo: ``They ought to change their name. From
going forward _ progress _ to going backward. Il Reazionario.''

<HEAD>`Bull Durham' Star Offers Tips For Watching World Series</HEAD>
<NOTE>For Release 6 p.m. EDT, Time set by source.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>RADNOR, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baseball fans trying to pick a team in this
year's World Series should check out the players' waists, according
to actress Susan Sarandon, who portrayed a baseball groupie in the
hit movie ``Bull Durham.''
   ``Never root for a team whose uniforms have elastic stretch
waistbands,'' Ms. Sarandon writes in the Oct. 15 issue of TV Guide
magazine. ``They are unsightly and without grace. ... It is the
reason the Cubs never make it.''
   Game 1 of the 1988 World Series is scheduled to begin at 8 p.m.
EDT Saturday and will be televised on NBC. The Oakland Athletics
will play the winner of the National League Championship Series
between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Mets.
   Speaking as Annie Savoy _ the movie's believer in biorhythms,
mysticism and the ``Church of Baseball'' _ Miss Sarandon urges
viewer to root only for teams with belt loops, an undomed stadium
and no artificial turf.
   ``Keep an eye on the Oakland A's,'' she says. ``They play on
grass, under the sky and have terrific belt loops. Plus they've got
a circus elephant on their sleeves.''
   Miss Sarandon also says all series should go for seven games.
   ``It's a holy, magic number, a prime number, and a seventh game
assures the longest possible baseball season,'' she says. ``And the
shortest possible winter unless you go to Puerto Rico for winter
ball, where you can discover the next Jose Canseco while eating
fish soup in the bleachers at Santurce.''
   Among her other tips for viewers, Miss Sarandon says:
   _Disconnect phones.
   _Don't use remote control. ``To be shopping around, switching
channels, shows a lack of respect.''
   _Place the TV screen facing north, feet pointing south and
``refreshments at equidistant points to the east and west.''
   _Avoid health food. ``Nachos, dip, beer and hot dogs are
spiritually correct,'' she says. ``Your biosystem will adjust and
forgive you.''
   _Don't watch in curlers.
   _Wear loose clothes to avoid fainting when emotions peak.
   _Stick with one team, even if its situation seems desperate.
``Miracles can happen,'' she says. ``They have in the past and they
will again. You've just gotta believe in the Church of Baseball.''

   Tamil rebels hacked and shot to death
47 sleeping villagers, the military said Monday, one year after
Indian troops were sent to this island nation to end the violence
by the insurgents.
   Indian troops near the village of Ulukulama, 150 miles northeast
of the capital, ambushed 40 rebels hiding in the jungle after the
massacre of the villagers, killing 12 of the insurgents, according
to the Indian High Commission in Colombo.
   The massacre was the worst burst of violence since the Indian
soldiers landed in Sri Lanka on Oct. 10, 1987, to quell the
5-year-old Tamil rebellion for a separate homeland in the
northeastern part of the island.
   In another development in the southern city of Matara, 85 miles
south of Colombo, soldiers opened fire on anti-government
demonstrators who attacked a police station, according to police.
Five people were killed and four wounded. Also on Monday, two bombs
exploded in the suburbs of Colombo, injuring four people, including
two soldiers, police said.
   In Colombo and most other cities on the island, shops and
businesses remained closed Monday in a protest by the majority
Sinhalese population against the government's peace overtures to
the Tamil insurgents.
   The government imposed a 48-hour curfew Monday, beginning at 6
a.m., ordered schools closed in many districts and put security
personnel on alert.
   There were no private vehicles on the roads, and
government-owned buses were escorted by heavily armed soldiers.
   On Sunday night, about 75 Tamil rebels attacked the village of
Ulukulama and killed 47 people, including 13 women and 18 children,
said a military official in Colombo who demanded anonymity.
   At least four people were seriously injured and 11 homes were
set on fire in the attack, said the official. He said the victims,
who were Sinhalese, were either fatally shot or hacked to death
with knives and swords.
   The village massacre occurred on Army Day, which honors Sri
Lankan soldiers involved in a drive against the insurgents in April
1987 on the northern Jaffna peninsula.
   The Sinhalese claim the government is granting too many
concessions to the Tamils, including a peace accord signed in July
1987 to end the civil war that has claimed at least 8,500 lives.
   Under the accord, the rebels agreed to surrender their weapons
in exchange for limited autonomy. But they reneged on the plan in
October 1987, claiming they were not satisfied with the provisions
for self-rule.
   The attack on the village occurred one day before nominations
for local elections in the province were scheduled to end. The
largest rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, called
for a boycott but three other insurgent groups have filed
nominations for seats on the provincial council. The date of the
elections has not been set.
   About 47,000 Indian soldiers were stationed in the island's
Tamil-dominated northeastern province to put down the rebellion.
India became involved in the ethnic conflict of its southern
neighbor because of the sympathies of its own 60 mllion Tamils for
the rebel cause.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
claim they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up
75 percent of the population and control Sri Lanka's military and
government.
   The Sinhalese People's Liberation Front has vowed to kill all
supporters of the peace plan and has been blamed for at least 500
killings since the accord was signed.

<HEAD>Waite Still Missing After Reported Release Deadline Passes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church of England envoy Terry Waite
remained missing Monday after the deadline for his release reported
by a Beirut newspaper passed with no sign of the British hostage
negotiator.
   The conservative Al-Anwar daily, which is based in Christian
east Beirut, on Friday quoted an unidentified source as predicting
that Waite would be freed in 72 hours.
   Waite, 48, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his hotel in
Moslem west Beirut for a rendezvous with the captors of two
American hostages.
   Lebanon's media has reported at least 25 times this year that
Waite or others among the 14 foreigners missing in Lebanon were
about to be released. None was.
   This year's release of five hostages _ three Frenchmen, a West
German and an Indian _ all were signaled in advance by communiques
from the captors.
   None was independently predicted by Lebanese radio stations or
newspapers.
   The weekly Ash-Shiraa magazine, which gained international fame
after breaking the story of the secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in
November 1986, has published at least 10 erroneous predictions that
a hostage release was imminent this year.
   It reported Friday that the release last week of Indian
professor Mithileshawr Singh, a legal resident alien of the United
States, by Shiite Moslem kidnappers after 20 months in captivity,
marked ``the beginning of the release of more American hostages.''
   It said Waite would be freed ``very soon'' and American hostages
would be released before the U.S. presidential election Nov.8.
   Waite was in Lebanon to help gain the freedom of Americans Terry
Anderson and Thomas Sutherland when he disappeared. Although no
group has claimed to hold him, Lebanese officials believe he is
held by Shiite extremists.
   Anderson and Sutherland are held by Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian
Shiite faction.
   Apart from Waite, Anderson and Sutherland, seven other
Americans, three Britons, an Irishman and an Italian are missing in
Lebanon.

<HEAD>Enrile Denies Involvement in Alleged Plot Against Aquino</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile on
Monday denied a published report that he and his sister were
involved in an alleged plot to topple President Corazon Aquino.
   The Philippine Daily Globe quoted National Security Adviser
Emanuel Soriano as saying a senator and his sister _ whom the
newspaper identified as Enrile and Irma Ponce Enrile Potenciano _
were linked to the plan.
   The newspaper quoted Soriano as saying Enrile would fund the
alleged plot to be staged Jan. 6.
   Enrile denied the allegations in a radio interview on Monday.
   ``I am calling Soriano a liar,'' Enrile said. ``I challenge
Soriano to come out with details of the (plan) so that we can
discuss it in any proper forum.''
   Soriano also denied the Globe report in a separate radio
interview, saying ``I don't know who came out with that story ... I
am making an official denial.''
   According to the Globe, buses owned by Mrs. Potenciano were to
transport renegade soldiers led by Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan, who
organized an attempted coup against Mrs. Aquino on Aug. 28, 1987,
in which at least 53 people were killed and more than 300 others
wounded.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told reporters he was aware of the
rumored plot but said his information was based on ``raw
intelligence'' and that Honasan was unlikely to be capable of
mounting another coup.
   Honasan was arrested in December and escaped from prison in
April. He was Enrile's security chief when the senator was defense
minister under former President Ferdinand Marcos. Enrile was fired
in November 1986 after a failed coup by his followers.
   Also Monday, a Manila court dismissed a petition by Marcos to
return home, where he was to testify in a trial on alleged bribes
his administration received during 20 years in power.
   Marcos and his family fled to Hawaii after the 1986 revolt that
swept Mrs. Aquino to the presidency.
   The court dismissed Marcos' petition to return home, where he
faces 39 civil cases on charges he embezzled up to $10 billion
during his rule. He has not been charged with criminal violations
and Philippine law bans trials in absentia.
   ``Marcos can answer the charges by disposition, which is by
issuing legal statements from his home in Honolulu,'' the court
resolution said.
   Marcos had asked the court to let him return and act as his own
counsel during the deposition, but the court said Marcos' return
was a political issue requiring a decision by the Aquino government.
   Mrs. Aquino has repeatedly refused to allow her predecessor to
return on grounds of national security.
   In another development, Philippine and U.S. officials have
finished talks on U.S. bases and an agreement on their status
through 1991 would emerge within a week, according to a highly
reliable source.
   The source said Philippine and U.S. officials have finished
talks to determine compensation, security and other issues
regarding four U.S. bases.
   ``It's over. An agreement is possible within a few days, maybe
within a week's time,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``There was compromise on both sides,'' he added without
elaborating.
   The Philippine panel was reportedly asking $1.2 billion a year
for the use of the bases, but U.S. officials are offering only half
that amount.
   Panels from both countries began reviewing the status of Clark
Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller installations in
April, but the talks stalled over compensation and other issues.
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus has been meeting with U.S.
officials in New York and Washington since September to discuss the
bases. He is expected to return to Manila this week.
   The United States maintains the bases under a 1947 agreement
that expires in 1991.

   About 1,000 guerrillas of the Karen ethnic
minority attacked Burmese army posts along the Moei River frontier
with Thailand, a government spokesman said Monday.
   Kyaw Sann said the guerrillas had raided perimeter outposts
Sept. 26, then attacked the army at Methawaw on the Moei's western
bank.
   More than 150 shells from mortars and recoilless rifles crashed
into Methawaw on Sunday, and some shells struck Thai territory,
Kyaw Sann told a news conference. The area is about 130 miles
northeast of Rangoon.
   He gave no casualty figures for the battle, which he described
as one of the largest since Sept. 30, when government forces drove
about 2,000 Burma Communist Party guerrillas from Mong Yang in
eastern Burma. The guerrillas had attacked the government outpost
Sept. 23.
   The government said more than 200 guerrillas and 47 soldiers,
including five officers, were killed at Mong Yang.
   Karens and the communists are the country's two most powerful
insurgencies, and have fought for decades. The Karens seek greater
autonomy for their areas.
   Burma has about 2 million Karens among its 38 million people.
Most live along the Thai-Burmese border and in the Irrawaddy delta.
   Western diplomats in Rangoon say the military government is
trying to highlight alleged threats from the communists, insurgents
among the dozen ethnic minorities and ``outside powers'' to justify
ruthless actions of recent weeks.
   ``The army has no crediblity left,'' a Western diplomat based in
Rangoon said Monday. ``The military is occupying its own country.''
   He said the army has killed thousands of anti-government
demonstrators and lost its image as ``the protector of the
country's unity.''
   Gen. Saw Maung seized power Sept. 18 in an attempt to stop weeks
of anti-government protest, and at least 440 people have been
killed since by official count. Burma has been ruled by repressive
military governments since a coup in 1962 by Gen. Ne Win.
   Kyaw Sann said Monday the government will permit freedom of
organization and speech when law and order is restored, but ``the
situation (now) does not permit such freedoms.''
   He acknowledged more than 3,000 students had joined the Karens
and other rebel groups since the Saw Maung coup.
   ``Though they could be classified as rebels, we still consider
them youths gone astray by mistake and will accept them back into
the legal fold, but we will have to regard them as rebels after a
certain period, which will have to be determined later,'' Kyaw Sann
said.
   Saw Maung has promised to relinquish power to whoever wins
general election, but has not set a date for the vote.
   The Western diplomat said: ``It is a reasonably good assumption
that there will be elections. The military doesn't want to stay in
power that long. But looking at it realistically you cannot expect
free, democratic elections. To defuse the political situation,
there has to at least be a pretense of elections.''
   He said the military did not want to become intricately involved
in day-to-day government operations.

   Some University of Maryland students
say they'd rather study than party. In fact, the campus motto may
become, ``I'd rather be studying.''
   ``People are really sitting down and taking things seriously,''
said Georgette Kiser, 20, a junior from Baltimore County and an
officer in student government. ``I think students are saying, `We
have to start studying.'''
   ``I've never studied harder in my life,'' said senior Eric
Young, 21, of Potomac. Young said he was ``sick to death'' of
Maryland's party-school image something that almost kept him from
attending the school.
   After the Student Government Association voted on the new
slogan, students presented Acting President William Kirwan with a
12-foot banner bearing the motto and hundreds of signatures. About
4,000 students signed petitions supporting a referendum on the
slogan.
   ``I think the enthusiasm of some of the administrators to make
the school `top 10' is rubbing off on the students,'' said Kevin
Kalmbach, 26, a sophomore from Arnold and SGA legislator active in
the campaign. ``As standards go up, they students know they can't

   Students get the credit they deserve _ or
don't deserve _ under a new program at Daviess County High School.
   The program is part of a new class in money and banking that
puts theory into practice on cases including homecoming and
cafeteria expenses.
   First County High Trust had its grand opening Oct. 2 in the
front lobby of Daviess County High School.
   As bank president Davida Howard welcomed customers, two student
marketing directors, Karla Koller and Michelle Carter, answered
reporters' questions. Student loan officer Mike Royal, meanwhile,
explained the application forms to students already thinking ahead
to homecoming expenses.
   If 10 percent of the school's 1,500 students open accounts, the
program will be considered successful, said Jim Howell, a business
and data-processing teacher at the high school.
   While the program will introduce many students to handling
personal finances, Howell said, the most instructive experience
might be for those students whose loan applications are rejected.
   ``If somebody has a lot of DMs (discipline marks) and a lot of
absences, he's probably not going to pay back the loan without a
lot of hassle,'' said student banker Derek Sexton.
   One pending loan application is from a student who wants $150

   Among the first to start a savings account at the bank was
junior Mark Girten, who was lured by the 7 percent yield on savings.
   ``That's better than you can get in town,'' he said.
   As of Oct. 2, the student bank had about $4,000 in assets. That
included start-up deposits of $1,000 by Central Bank and $500 from
the high school's general fund.

   It wasn't the Wild West, or even west
Pittsburgh, but a posse was called out early Monday when a chestnut
mare wandered through the city's Allentown section and neighboring
Mount Oliver.
   The mare, named Skip, apparently had been spooked by something
during the night and took off from her stable, said owner Natalie
Higgins.
   Pittsburgh police were called about 5:30 a.m. when a motorist
reported sighting a riderless horse.
   Police caught Skip at a convenience store parking lot, where it
was tied to a sign post. But, authorities said, a police dog
frightened the horse again and it fell on the asphalt, snapping its
rope and setting it free.
   Authorities said the horse sauntered off with several police
cars in pursuit, until it was captured in a restaurant parking lot
and held until Mrs. Higgins arrived to ride it home at sunrise.

<HEAD>Arabs Say Rioters Casting Votes With Their Stones</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinians contend Arab
rioters are casting votes when they hurl stones in the occupied
territories because the Arab rebellion has critically influenced
Israel's upcoming general election.
   ``We are very aware of the impact of throwing stones,'' said
Burhan Attalah, 24, a teacher from Bethlehem who was jailed for six
months without trial for anti-Israeli activism. ``The Palestinian
problem is reaching the bedroom of every Israeli.''
   In campaigning Monday in the coastal city of Ashkelon, Labor
Party leader Shimon Peres met with loud applause when he said the
only result of Israel giving up occupied territory would be ridding
itself of 1.5 million Arabs.
   But Attalah, like many Palestinians, believes the 10-month
uprising has strengthened the electoral prospects of right-wing
rival Yitzhak Shamir _ and stymied hopes of a negotiated
Arab-Israeli peace settlement soon.
   The uprising, which has left more than 290 Palestinians and six
Israelis dead, has become a major issue in the Nov. 1 parliamentary
election. Films of stone-throwing Palestinian protesters even have
been used in campaign ads.
   Some Palestinians said they favored Peres' left-leaning Labor
Party because he supports exchanging some land in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip for peace.
   However, even Labor supporters conceded that though Peres, the
foreign minister, might bring peace talks more quickly, only Prime
Minister Shamir's hard-line Likud bloc can deliver a long-term
solution to the conflict.
   ``The peace process might start earlier with the Labor Party,''
said Jack Khazmo, owner of the pro-Palestine Liberation
Organization weekly Al Bayader Assiyasi. ``But with the Likud it
could ultimately be stronger.''
   The reason, Khazmo said, is that without Likud there cannot be
the nationwide consensus required to initiate a peace process or
make the territorial concessions demanded by Palestinians.
   Shamir has opposed a U.S.-backed international conference on
Middle East peace supported by Peres, his governing partner. Shamir
also has refused to concede any of the land Israel seized during
the 1967 Middle East war and supports expanded Jewish settlements
on the land.
   ``If Shamir wins, this means Israel isn't convinced there is a
Palestinian problem. But after another year or two, when Israelis
see they cannot crush the Palestinian uprising by force and the
only answer is to negotiate _ at that moment the peace process
could be stronger than with a Labor victory,'' Khazmo said.
   ``If the Likud wins, it will introduce even stronger tactics to
try to crush the uprising,'' said Ziad Abbas, a 24-year-old
free-lance journalist from Bethlehem who served six months in
prison for allegedly inciting protests. ``And that will cause the
rebellion to explode even further.''
   With Labor and Likud running neck-and-neck in polls, Khazmo said
``the worst possible scenario'' would be a draw leading to another
uneasy coalition between the two parties, which he called ``another
government with its hands tied in terms of a peace process.''
   Later Monday, assailants threw a stone at Peres' car as it
passed through Kiryat Gat, a town developed by the government and
mainly populated by North African immigrants who lean toward Likud.
   The stone caused minor damage to the roof, Israel radio said.
Peres was not hurt, and the assailants fled, the radio said.

<HEAD>Memory of Dead Leaders Dominate Pakistan's Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The campaign for Pakistan's first
free elections in a decade began over the weekend with the
formation of alliances inspired by the memory of dead leaders.
   The political battle lines were drawn between the eight-party
Islamic Democratic Alliance and the Pakistan People's Alliance _
two groups whose members supported the late President Mohammed Zia
ul-Haq _ and the opposition Pakistan People's Alliance _ a moderate
three-party coalition led by Benazir Bhutto.
   Zia, who led Pakistan for 11 years, died in an Aug. 17 plane
crash. He seized power in a 1977 coup by ousting Ms. Bhutto's
father _ socialist Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto _ and
ordering him hanged two years later.
   Ms. Bhutto will lead her party into Nov. 16 elections that are
widely considered to be the first free elections in Pakistan since
Bhutto's death.
   On Sunday, Ms. Bhutto invited Pakistani reporters into her
Karachi home to announce that her party, if elected, would form a
coalition government with the eight parties that form the Movement
for the Restoration of Democracy, a left-leaning coalition.
   Mohammed Khan Junejo, who served as Zia's prime minister for
three years, failed to heal a split among Zia loyalists. Zia in May
fired Junejo and other members of the Pakistan Muslim League who
formed the Cabinet, but kept on several other loyalists in an
interim government.
   That governing group, headed by chief Minister Nawaz Sharif,
formed its own faction in September.
   The Islamic Democratic Alliance, headed by the Nawaz faction,
and the Pakistan People's Alliance, headed by the more moderate
Junejo forces, both support Zia's program of making Islam the law
of Pakistan and his staunch military backing of anti-communist
Moslem rebels in Afghanistan.
   Both groups draw support from Zia's traditional power base of
business, wealthy landowners and the military. But the division
among the Zia loyalists is fueled by Junejo's bitterness after Zia
accused his government of corruption and incompetence.
   Ms. Bhutto espouses her father's populism and has inherited his
broad support among the masses, but she has pulled her party away
from his socialist economic policies, including nationalization of
industries.
   She also has pledged to continue Zia's Afghan policy and has
called for continued close ties with the United States.
   But Ms. Bhutto has said that Islam should remain a religion and
not enter politics, saying Islamisation would affect women's rights
and the country's system of justice.
   Ms. Bhutto's allies are expected to do well in the elections,
possibly winning a simple majority in a new national assembly.
   Later this week, the federal election commission is to allocate
symbols to each party to aid the illiterate, who comprise nearly
three-fourths of the country's 48 million voters. The approved list
of 82 symbols include pictures of a car, a slingshot and a
butterfly.

<HEAD>Official Disputes Western Counts of Political Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About a dozen people still are imprisoned under
two of the main laws that have been used against political
dissidents, a Soviet official said Monday.
   Alexei Glukhov, deputy chief of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's
department for humanitarian and cultural relations, also told the
Tass news agency that Western estimates of more than 200 Soviets
jailed for religious or political beliefs under those laws or
others are untrue.
   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International
estimated that about 200 Soviets were prisoners of conscience as of
the beginning of September.
   Without mentioning Amnesty International, Glukhov said such
estimates are four to five times too high, and include many people
who are ``black marketeers and thieves, murderers and spies, people
who committed military crimes, traitors, and mental patients under
compulsory medical treatment,'' Glukhov said.
   The Soviet Union released many political prisoners beginning in
1987, and prominent figures such as independent journalist Sergei
Grigoryants and religious activist Alexander Ogorodnikov have
stayed out of jail for the most part since then despite periodic
scrapes with the law.
   Those arrested for taking part in demonstrations now are more
likely to be sentenced to 10- or 15-day jail terms, or fined.
   Glukhov said about a dozen people convicted under articles of
the Soviet criminal code against anti-Soviet agitation and
propaganda or defaming the system remain in jail.
   Soviet officials have said they are studying those two laws as
part of a review of the criminal code to make them more precise and
prevent future abuses.
   Others who were tried under those laws have been found to be
mentally ill and have been sent for compulsory treatment, Glukhov
said.
   The Soviet Union quit the World Psychiatric Association in 1983
in the face of almost certain expulsion because of revelations of
the use of psychiatry against mentally healthy political dissidents.
   In January, the Soviet Union announced new laws that it said
would prohibit such abuse of psychiatry.
   Glukhov said the number of Soviets held under laws on political
and religious activity ``keeps diminishing every day as cases are
reviewed, people are released from penal institutions even before
completing their terms or checked out of psychiatric hospitals
after a re-examination.''
   ``The continuing propaganda campaign in the West does not take
into account the stable trend for creating a law-governed state and
humanizing every aspect of life in the U.S.S.R.,'' Glukhov said.
   He charged that the Western reports were aimed at sabotaging a
Vienna conference on security and cooperation in Europe, and Soviet
proposals to hold a human rights conference in Moscow. The head of
the U.S. delegation to the conference, Ambassador Warren
Zimmermann, confirmed last week that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze told Secretary of State George P. Shultz last month
about 40 political prisoners will be released.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men claiming fatherhood of a 7-year-old
girl are asking the U.S. Supreme Court for a Solomon-like decision
which could affect other fathers in so-called reverse paternity
cases.
   ``This case arises out of a societal phenomenon of men assuming
the responsibility we've always told them to assume as parents,''
says attorney Larry Hoffman. The case is scheduled to be heard
Tuesday by the high court.
   In the classic paternity case, a man who denies fathering a
child out of wedlock may be forced by the courts to take financial
responsibility for the child.
   ``I consider this a double reverse paternity case,'' Hoffman
says. ``We have not one, but two, men coming forward wanting to
support and care for this child.''
   Hoffman represents a married couple, Gerald and Carole Dearing,
who are fighting a suit by Michael Hirschensohn, Mrs. Dearing's
former lover.
   Hirschensohn, who says he is the biological father of Victoria
Dearing, wants visitation rights and ``the opportunity to be
involved in the child's life,'' says his attorney, Joel Aaronson.
   ``All he wants is to be able to visit with the child and give
the child the warmth and nurturing a parent gives a child,'' says
Aaronson.
   The problem is a California law which mirrors similar statutes
in other states. It holds that a woman's legal husband, unless he
is impotent or sterile, is the father of any child born during the
marriage.
   Aaronson says the law is outdated and unfair and wants the
Supreme Court to overrule it.
   The lawyer notes the increasing role of stepfathers and
stepmothers in the lives of children of divorce and says Victoria
would not be unique among her classmates if she was sharing her
time with two fathers.
   The events which created this legal triangle reflect the
complxities of life in the 1980s. The facts acknowledged by both
lawyers are these:
   Gerald and Carole Dearing were married in 1976. There were
separations, and from 1978 to 1984 Mrs. Dearing had an intermittent
sexual affair with Hirschensohn in Los Angeles and St. Thomas in
the Virgin Islands.
   In September 1980, Mrs. Dearing became pregnant. Her husband
attended Lamaze classes with her and was present in the delivery
room when the baby was born by Caesarean section on May 11, 1981.
   ``Gerald was the proudest of fathers...,'' his lawyer's brief
states.
   But Hirschensohn says Mrs. Dearing told him soon after the
baby's birth that the infant probably was his.
   Just after Victoria's first birthday, Dearing, the U.S.
representative of a French oil company, was transferred from Los
Angeles to New York. His wife and daughter stayed behind.
   Mrs. Dearing, Hirschensohn and the child then had blood tests
which showed a 98.07 percent probability that Hirschensohn was the
father. Dearing has not had a blood test and his lawyer claims it
is irrelevant because the law says he is the father.
   In the fall of 1982, Hirschensohn sued to be named Victoria's
legal father.
   There were upheavals in the Dearing marriage, and Mrs. Dearing
and Victoria lived with Hirschensohn intermittently until April
1984, when she accused him of ``peculiar behavior'' and obtained a
restraining order to keep him away from the little girl. That June,
she reconciled with her husband in New York.
   Since then, Hoffman said, the Dearings have had another child
and a third baby is due any day.
   Hirschensohn, a businessman who divides his time between St.
Thomas and Los Angeles, has not seen Victoria again except for one
brief visit in 1986.
   Appeals courts in California have ruled against Hirschensohn,
upholding a law they say was designed to protect the integrity of
the family.
   ``Marriage is a really sacred institution in the law,'' says
Hoffman. ``This law is traceable to antiquity.''
   In California, the concept of husband as father was written into
the state's first laws in 1872. Aaronson says it's time for the
courts to respond to societal changes.
   ``We've come to the point in society where we can prove a
biological connection between people who wish to be biologically
connected,'' he says, adding,``There may be a psychological father
as well as a biological father.'' Hoffman insists the biological
link is irrelevant.
   ``We think other things mean as much or more,'' he says.
``Because a man has biological responsibility does not make him a
better father.''

<HEAD>Falklands Immigration Issue Stirs Heated Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The people of the Falkland Islands are demanding
that immigration to the south Atlantic archipelago be restricted to
10 families a year, according to the Falkland Islands Association.
   The London-based association, which fosters links with the 2,000
inhabitants of the British colony, says citizens attending a recent
public meeting in the capital of Stanley said immigration should be
restricted to 40 people a year.
   The association's newsletter reported in its latest issue that
the islanders' supporters in Britain were ``startled'' because many
in Britain would like the population to rise to 10,000 and expand
the economy, which relies solely on fishing and sheep farming.
   The newsletter canvassed opinion among residents of the island,
300 miles east of Argentina, and reported a variety of responses.
   Kitty Bertrand of Stanley worried that Britain would dump
undesirables on the islands.
   ``We do not want masses of people rushed in who cannot do a
hands' turn for themselves. We want do-it-yourself types. Good
sensible British people suitable for our way of life,'' she wrote.
   Sydney Miller said: ``We need people, especially tradesmen, but
we have nowhere to put them.''
   Legislative councilor Robin Lee of Port Howard also cited a
housing shortage, and added: ``If you increase (immigration) too
quickly, the local population becomes the minority and will have
little say in the way the country is being run.''
   Lee said the islanders feel that a population of 5,000 in 10 to
15 years ``is about right.''
   Tim Miller of Manybranch Farm wrote to suggest 100 immigrants a
year for the next three years. ``I feel most of us want change ...
but we want it to be at a pace we can influence, to minimize the
bad things and maximize the benefits of the 20th century.''
   Norma Edwards, a former Stanley councilor, wrote: ``We've plenty
of space for lots more people, but we can't expect them to sit on a
wind-blown peat bog without being able to offer them a satisfying
and rewarding future.''
   Mike Summers, an association member, told The Associated Press
that hundreds of Britons have applied to immigrate to the islands
but are being turned away for lack of housing.
   Summers said the issue was controversial because the islanders
``tend to be protective about their way of life. They're most
afraid that their quiet well-behaved sort of place will be affected
if it's flooded with immigrants.''
   The islands are claimed by Argentina as the Malvinas. In 1982,
Argentine troops overran the archipelago but surrendered to a
British task force after a 74-day war.
   Talks have since deadlocked over Britain's refusal to accept an
Argentine demand that the question of sovereignty be on the agenda.

   Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou,
recovering from heart surgery, left the hospital Monday with his
girlfriend at his side and went to a hotel for further
convalescence.
   Papandreou, 69, underwent an operation to replace a heart valve
10 days ago at Harefield Hospital.
   Dimitre Liani, who has been a frequent visitor at the hospital,
accompanied Papandreou as he left the hospital. Her presence has
prompted widespread speculation that the prime minister planned to
end his 37-year marriage and marry Mrs. Liani, 34.
   The Greek Embassy said he will spend about 10 days at the
Grosvenor House Hotel before returning to Greece.
   ``He has made a speedy recovery from his operation and has been
allowed out of hospital in a very fast time,'' said Papandreou's
spokesman, Tilemacos Chytiris.
   ``He must go back there twice for check-ups before he returns to
Greece,'' Chytiris said. ``He has an office in the hotel and will
be in contact with the Greek government. He can also go out for
walks.''
   ``The doctors at Harefield have said he is very well and he will
get better very soon,'' the spokesman said.

<HEAD>Wells Fargo Trial Set To Start After Three Years of Delays</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After more than three years of arguments,
motions and other legal maneuvers, a federal trial is set to begin
Tuesday for five people accused in the $7.1 million theft from a
Wells Fargo depot in 1983.
   The five are accused of participating in a conspiracy to plot
the heist and transport the stolen cash, not of carrying out the
robbery.
   The government contends that the robbery, the second-largest in
U.S. history, was plotted by Los Macheteros, a Puerto Rican
nationalist group with a history of violence.
   The FBI says that a Wells Fargo security guard was responsible
for the theft of the West Hartford depot on Sept. 12, 1983. Victor
M. Gerena, formerly of Hartford, is accused of tying up co-workers,
loading the cash into a car and fleeing to Cuba, where he is still
believed to be hiding out, the FBI says.
   The torn halves of a $10 bill are the only money that has been
recovered. The government contends that the money was used to
finance the activities of Los Macheteros.
   The trial of nine other defendants was postponed after a ruling
by U.S. District Judge T. Emmet Clarie earlier this year tossing
out some wiretap evidence collected by the FBI. The government is
appealing that ruling.
   Two of the seven remaining defendants pleaded guilty last month
during jury selection. They are awaiting sentencing.
   Their pleas left five men who will stand trial Tuesday:
Harvard-educated Segarra, Carlos Ayes Suarez, Norman Ramirez
Talavera, Roberto Maldonado Rivera and Antonio Comacho Negron.
   Ayes' attorney, James W. Bergenn, said Monday he expects the
trial to last until late January.
   There are expected to be few surprises during the trial, with
the possible exception of previously undisclosed evidence the
government collected through wiretaps on the defendants in the
United States and Puerto Rico.
   The attorney for Segarra told the court during jury selection
that his client knew in advance that the heist would occur and
later came into possession of some of the stolen cash. But the
attorney, Leonard Weinglass, said his client didn't plan the
robbery and didn't participate in it.
   Weinglass said he would argue that is not a crime to keep silent
about a planned robbery.
   The U.S. Justice Department has indicated that it considers this
an important case. The defendants' arrests in August 1985 were
announced by then-U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   During arraignments in U.S. District Court three years ago,
heavily armed federal agents closed streets and mounted rooftops to
provide security.
   But security has been relaxed during the more than 18 months of
pre-trial arguments. Some defendants have settled in Hartford,
sending their children to local schools.
   Clarie ordered the names of the 12 jurors and six alternates
kept secret. The judge said he wanted to protect the jurors,
particularly from mass mailings by supporters of the defendants.

<TEXT>
   MOUNT WASHINGTON, N.H. _ Three lightly clad hikers emerged safe
today after 24 hours in snow, fog and wind on Mount Washington,
where the wind-chill at the summit was 17 below zero this morning.
   The three ignored advice from a shelter caretaker on the
6,288-foot mountain Sunday evening and continued toward the summit,
said Peter Crane, a member of the staff at a mountaintop weather
observatory.
   A search official, Michael Torrey of the Appalachian Mountain
Club, said the three _ and a companion who turned back part way _
probably set out from Pinkham Notch on the eastern side of the
Northeast's tallest mountain at about 2 p.m. Sunday.
   He said the hikers had no rain gear or warm clothes and were
wearing blue jeans and poor boots. One had a sweatshirt, another a
sweater and the third a parka. Their only provisions were two
apples and a soda bottle full of water.
   Maj. Henry Mock of the state Fish and Game Department said they
reached Crawford Notch, a pass on the western side of the mountain,
around 2 p.m. in good condition.
   He identified them as Steve Sardella, 20, of Marlboro, Mass.;
Matt Dube, 21, of Bethany, Conn.; and Andy Stewart, 23, of Syosset,
New York. He said the man who turned back is Noel Bouvier of Boston.
   Washington is notorious for severe and quickly changing weather.
   ``To survive in that kind of weather conditions, you have to be
very well equipped,'' Mock said before the three were found.
   Fish and game employees and volunteers helped search for the
men, but weather conditions were too poor to send out planes,
officials said.
   Inexperienced hikers frequently get into trouble in the White
Mountains because the weather changes quickly and is much harsher
at higher elevations than at trailheads in valleys below.
   The 6,288-foot mountain has some of the worst weather on Earth.
Snow has fallen on the summit in every month, and numerous hikers
have died after getting lost in blowing snow and fog in the past
century.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishop Criticizes Israeli Actions On West Bank</HEAD>

   The Roman Catholic Patriarch of Jerusalem
began a month-long tour of the United States and Canada Monday with
criticism of Israel's treatment of Palestinian Arabs on the West
Bank and Gaza.
   All schools have been closed and thousands of Palestinians are
in detentention camps in ``a situation of suffering,'' Bishop
Michel Sabbah said at a luncheon arranged by the Arab League.
   The prelate said the Israeli crackdown had reached the point
where private teachers risk punishment of up to 10 years in jail if
they teach children at home.
   The patriarch, who represents 80,000 Roman Catholics in Israel,
Jordan and Cyprus, is the first Palestinian appointed to the post
by the Vatican. He will visit San Antonio, Boston, New York,
Chicago, Milwaukee, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Maui, Hawaii, as
well as Toronto and Montreal in Canada.
   President Reagan is expected to receive him in the White House
Oct. 18.
   ``The situation is very hard and difficult,'' Bishop Sabbah said
of conditions in Jerusalem and in the Israeli-held West Bank and
Gaza.
   He said the violence was hurting the Israeli soldiers as well as
the Palestinians who began their 11th month of action against
Israeli control.
   ``The Jewish people are suffering,'' the Catholic official said.
In instances of violences wanted their own state on an equal
footing with Israel.
   ``People who are disenfranchised, who are dispossessed, cannot
remain at the margin,'' Maksoud said.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 3 grafs to ADD other reorganizations in communist

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lubomir Strougal, who was
considered an economic reformer and had been the nation's premier
for more than 18 years, resigned Monday and gave up his seat on the
12-member Communist Party Politburo.
   Peter Colotka, premier of Slovakia, also quit his job and
membership on the party's ruling body. Communist Party chief Milos
Jakes announced the resignations at a plenary session of the party
Central Committee, the official news agency CTK reported.
   The shake-up in Czechoslovakia follows similar government
reorganizations in the Soviet Union, Hungary and Poland, as well as
unrest in Yugoslavia.
   The names of Strougal, Colotka and Foreign Minister Bohuslav
Chnoupek came up in a corruption scandal last year.
   Stanisdlav Babinsky, who ran a catering and supply operation in
rural Slovakia, was sentenced to 14{ years in prison after a
three-month trial that ended June 30, 1987.
   Nine other defendants also were sent to prison for ``stealing
Socialist ownership on a large scale for several years and
committing other criminal acts.''
   Babinsky named Strougal and Colotka during the trial, but it was
not clear what favors they were supposed to have received. Chnoupek
was said to have been given furniture, which he later paid for.
   When he took over as party chief from Gustav Husak in December
last year, Jakes said the fight against corruption would be among
his priorities.
   In his speech Monday to the Central Committee, Jakes also
announced other changes in the Politburo, party secretariat,
Central Committee and the federal, Czech and Slovak governments.
   Czechoslovakia consists of two republics of equal rights, the
Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic. Each is
governed by a National Council, which delegates to an overall
Federal Assembly responsibility for constitutional and foreign
affairs, defense and important economic decisions.
   The primary source of power in Czechoslovakia is the Communist
Party.
   CTK quoted the party chief as saying the actions were taken ``in
the interest of mastering the demanding tasks of economic and
social restructuring,'' but its report did not mention other names.
   Rumors of leadership changes have circulated for months. Jakes
and other officials have indicated younger people would be promoted
to senior positions.
   Strougal,63, said during interviews with Western journalists
earlier this year that he wanted to step down.
   He was considered a strong advocate of economic reform similar
to that being promoted in the Soviet Union by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, but his proposals were diluted and delayed by a party
leadership that has appeared reluctant to follow the Soviet example.
   Jakes said Monday ``there are persistent serious shortcomings''
in the economy. He praised the Soviet Union's ``peace policy'' but
did not mention Gorbachev's political and economic changes.
   Last April, in remarks ending a two-day Central Committee
session, Jakes said the leadership wanted ``to elevate younger
comrades, and thus create conditions for further successful
fulfillment of party tasks.''
   He said it was ``an important requirement to ensure that
qualified young people are more frequently proposed'' for key
economic and other jobs.
   Colotka has been premier of Slovakia since May 1969 and deputy
federal premier since September 1969. Strougal replaced Oldrich
Cernik as federal premier in January 1970.
   At Monday's meeting, first of a two-day plenary session on
ideology, Jakes also made clear that independent human rights,
ecological and other groups would not be allowed to operate as they
do in neighboring Hungary.
   Formation of ``anti-Socialist political structures'' will not be
tolerated and will be prosecuted, he declared.
   The Politburo met Wednesday to discuss personnel changes and
there was speculation that Vasil Bilak, long in charge of the
ideology portfolio, also would retire.
   Jan Fojtik, also an ideologist, was put on the Politburo in
April and his authority has appeared to grow.
   Jakes replaced Gustav Husak as party leader in December.

   More than 10,000 people gathered downtown
Monday to protest the government's inability to solve the city's
smog problem.
   Demonstrators chanted, ``No to the clouds!'' and held banners
reading, ``The clouds kill. The government has to take more
measures.''
   The brown smog that forms over the capital on warm days ``is a
daily threat for us and our children,'' said Theodoros Katrivanos,
head of a group of anti-pollution legislators.
   In January, the government introduced a series of anti-pollution
measures for the city of more than 3.5 million people that include
traffic restrictions and the abolition of a traditional afternoon
break in favor of a continuous work schedule.
   ``What we really need is the removal and transfer of industry
from Athens,'' Katrivanos said. There are 120 major plants
operating in the area.

   Actress Valerie Harper's mother, Iva
McConnell Harper, has died after a long fight with cancer. She was
71.
   Mrs. Harper died Friday in her apartment near the Beverly Hills
home of Valerie Harper and her husband, Tony Cacciotti. She had
been living with her daughter and son-in-law until the final month
of her illness, when she returned to her home.
   Valerie Harper canceled plans to attend a benefit race Sunday
sponsored by Love is Feeding Everyone, an organization she
co-founded with actor Dennis Weaver, said her publicist, Monique
Moss.
   At the time her mother was taken ill, Miss Harper was fighting a
legal battle over the television series ``Valerie'' with Lorimar
Telepictures.
   She won the contract dispute which claimed she was wrongfully
fired, and a Los Angeles Superior Court jury awarded her $1.8
million in compensatory damages and a share of the profits from the
show, now called ``The Hogan Family.''
   The family asked that in lieu of flowers, donations be sent to
The Hunger Project, an organization dedicated to feeding the poor,
based in San Francisco.
   Moss said private funeral arrangements would be made by the
family.

<HEAD>Dukakis Pulls Back Out-Of-State Staffers From Florida</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the fading Florida campaign of Michael
Dukakis got out their sweaters Monday and began heading to Ohio and
Michigan.
   ``I'm going to miss this place,'' said Paul Pezzella, the
Dukakis state campaign director, as he and Steve Rosenfeld, state
political director, handed over their titles and duties to Miami
attorney Alan G. Greer and Volusia County Commissioner Clay
Henderson.
   Pezzella goes to Cleveland as get-out-the-vote director for
Dukakis in Ohio and Rosenfeld will be based in Columbus handling
communications and scheduling. A $1,000-a-head fund raiser on Miami
Beach will go on as scheduled Tuesday without Dukakis, who is
staying home to prepare for his Thursday night debate.
   Five other Dukakis staffers in Florida have been transferred to
Ohio and three are going to Michigan. Last month, the state
campaign press secretary and a handful of other workers were moved
to Illinois. There are no campaign visits to Florida scheduled for
Dukakis or running mate Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.
   Pezzella said Dukakis wasn't writing off Florida's 21 electoral
votes, but the national campaign obviously decided that Ohio, with
23 electoral votes, and other Midwestern states were better
opportunities than Florida. Republican presidential candidates have
carried Florida in seven of the last nine elections.
   Pezzella, Dukakis' former chief lobbyist in Massachusetts, and
Rosenfeld, the governor's former chief legal counsel, directed
Dukakis' surprising lop-sided victory in the March 8 Democratic
presidential primary in Florida, then returned to the state in
August.
   Greer, who's been a leader of the Florida Dukakis campaign for
more than a year, said every transferred staffer is being replaced
by experienced Floridians and the campaign maintains 30 full-time
staffers and some 15 offices in the state.
   ``Obviously, this is not a Florida election, it is a national
election,'' Greer said. ``We have to have a national surge.
Assuming we get that national surge, we have the organization here
to move.''
   Greer said Dukakis is ``substantially behind in Florida,'' but
not nearly as badly as an Atlanta Constitution survey that gave
Bush a 26-point bulge in the state.
   Cori Zywotow, who has taken over as state campaign press
secretary, said some Florida workers are offended at the idea that
the departure of Bostonians means the campaign is giving up.
   ``We have a lot of talented people,'' she said.
   She came to the campaign after being spokeswoman for the City of
Miami Police Department, rocked in the past three years by
indictments of several police officers on drug charges.
   ``Talking about having experience with crises,'' she said,
adding quickly: ``That's not the right word. I mean experience with
excitement.''

<HEAD>Christians Authorize Patriarch To Negotiate on Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian members of Parliament
authorized the head of the dominant Maronite Catholic community on
Monday to negotiate with rival Moslems to elect a new Lebanese
president in efforts to end a political crisis.
   ``We have given ... (Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir) authorization to
negotiate in order to reach agreement as soon as possible on the
president who will be elected by Parliament,'' Deputy Speaker
Albert Mokhaiber said.
   ``We have pledged to abide by any agreement the patriarch
reaches in order to resolve the current crisis.''
   Mokhaiber made the statement after the 29 parliamentarians met
for 2{ hours with Sfeir in suburban Bkirki.
   Mokhaiber indicated that a new president might be elected before
Oct. 18, when the term of Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a
Shiite Moslem, expires.
   Lebanon has been without a head of state since Sept. 23, when
former President Amin Gemayel's six-year term ended without
Parliament having chosen a successor. That spawned rival Christian
and Moslem governments, with each claiming legitimacy.
   Parliament failed to convene before Gemayel's departure to elect
a successor when Christians boycotted three electoral sessions to
block the election of Syrian-backed candidates.
   The crisis is cementing Lebanon's de facto partition into
sectarian cantons in the nation's 13-year-old civil war.
   The Christians' new move suggested that Sfeir may sound out
Moslem leaders, and possibly Syria and the United States, on a
compromise candidate.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, backs Lebanon's Moslems
and sought to promote a pro-Syrian Christian into the presidency in
a bid to end the civil war.
   Minutes before Gemayel stepped down, he handed power to army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun, a Maronite, naming him caretaker prime
minister of a six-man military Cabinet.
   All three Moslem officers named to the Aoun Cabinet refused to
serve, and Moslem leaders declared allegiance to the incumbent
government of acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Syrian-backed
Sunni Moslem.
   Under an unwritten covenant dating from Lebanon's independence
from France in 1943, Maronites have held the posts of president,
army commander and central bank governor; the premier traditionally
was a Sunni, and the Parliament speaker a Shiite.
   Christians were deemed to be the majority in 1943. Moslems now
comprise an estimated 55 percent of Lebanon's 4 million people,
however, and demand an equal share of power.
   Hoss warned Monday that formally partitioning Lebanon would lead
to endless fighting between Christians and Moslems.
   ``I challenge the advocates of federalization or partition to
draw up the borders of their cantons. This cannot be done,'' Hoss
told The Associated Press.
   He was responding to a suggestion by Samir Geagea, leader of the
main Christian militia, that federalization would end the deadlock
over the presidential crisis and the civil war.
   ``Political decentralization or federalization will not ...
bring an end to the state of war, but will kindle an endless war on
the borders of the cantons. It will also lead to endless wars in
the streets, alleys, hills, villages and towns,'' Hoss declared.
   Right-wing Christians favor a federal system. They believe it
will safeguard their Western way of life from what they perceive as
the threat of Iran's brand of Islamic fundamentalism. Such
fundamentalism is growing among the Shiites here, Lebanon's largest
single sect.
   Shiite fundamentalist leaders held a mass rally in a south
Beirut mosque Monday under Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
spiritual guide of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   They said later in a statement that they unanimously rejected
any form of partition as a blow against Islam, and also rejected a
French proposal that U.N. forces be sent to Beirut to oversee the
election of a new president.

   An American Airlines DC-10 returning to Kennedy
Airport with engine trouble Monday was forced to dump its fuel,
which sprayed a neighborhood.
   ``We had reports that it was like a mist coming down,'' said
police spokesman Joseph McConville in Queens.
   The pilot noticed severe vibrations in one of the jet's three
engines shortly after takeoff at 12:12 p.m., said airline
spokeswoman Mary O'Neill.
   The pilot turned off the engine and ``dumped fuel in
anticipation of an immediate emergency landing,'' she said. The
plane landed safely at 12:30.
   Some of the 242 passengers on Flight 3 to Los Angeles were
placed on other flights and some were waiting for another plane to
be readied.
   Dumping fuel is a routine procedure to lighten the aircraft and
make it safer in case of emergency landing. It is released over
water when possible.

   Thunderstorms moved through northern Wisconsin, Michigan and the
lower Great Lakes Monday, but most of the nation enjoyed pleasant
fall weather.
   Scattered showers also dampened parts of southeast New Mexico
and southwest Texas.
   A few snowflakes swirled around Milwaukee at midday, but the
snow soon turned into rain as the temperature went into the low
60s. It was not the earliest snowfall on record for the city; that
record was set on Sept. 23, 1942.
   There were no record-breaking temperatures Monday, but four
record lows for the date were tied. The 41 degrees in Augusta, Ga.,
tied a 1987 mark. Columbia, S.C.'s 38 tied a record set in 1895 and
equaled last year. Midland, Texas, equaled its 1979 record of 43.
Raleigh, N.C.'s 38 matched a 1977 mark.
   The morning low for the nation was 11 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 43 degrees
at Marquette, Mich., to 100 at Palm Springs, Calif.
   Tuesday's forecast called for rain extending over New England,
New York state, eastern Ohio and much of Pennsylvania. Skies should
be cloudy over the Great Lakes and the Pacific Northwest. Strong
and gusty winds were expected over West Virginia.
   High temperatures should be in the 40s and 50s from the Upper
Mississippi Valley across the Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley and much
of New England. Highs should be in the 80s for Florida and southern
Texas, rising into the low 90s for the desert Southwest. The rest
of the nation should have highs in the 60s and 70s.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush, accusing rival
Michael Dukakis of having ``so much sympathy for criminals,''
proposed on Monday to increase criminal penalties and to give
victims an expanded role in criminal proceedings.
   ``I'm going to bring an attitude to the White House that has
more sympathy for the victims of crime than for the criminals,''
the vice president said in a Columbus Day addresss to an
Italian-American group.
   Bush said victims of crime ``should have the statutory right to
be informed of, be present and be heard at every critical stage of
the criminal justice process.''
   He told his audience at a Knights of Columbus hall that because
of the holiday ``you will be spared my usual political speech.''
Then he proceeded to hammer away at his familiar campaign theme
that Dukakis is soft on crime.
   ``I've spoken at length about the differences I have with my
opponent on this fundamental issue, and that's not my purpose
today. Suffice it to say that I think there is something very wrong
when there is so much sympathy for criminals and very little left
over for victims,'' the GOP nominee said.
   Bush proposed making it easier for victims to collect civil
judgments for restitution and allowing them to get more money
automatically if a convict's financial circumstances improve.
   He also called for expanding a federal fund created to
compensate victims of crimes.
   ``I believe we should consider raising the fees charged
defendents upon conviction so that more money can be channeled to
victims,'' he said.
   ``On this Columbus Day, we are rediscovering America. It is a
kind and gentle nation with opportunities limited only by our
dreams,'' Bush said. ``And we refuse to let criminals snuff out
those dreams.''
   Earlier, meeting with reporters on his Air Force Two campaign
plane, Bush said he favors review of the federal prison furlough
program, although he has no specific revisions in mind. ``I just
... want to be sure it never slips into the Massachusetts model,''
he said.
   Bush's criticism of the Massachusetts program, which until
modified allowed convicted murderers to be released on weekend
furloughs, has prompted Dukakis, the governor of that state, to
criticize the federal furlough system.
   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen was quick to
respond to
   Bush's decision to review the federal system. ``After 2,818 days
of sitting on the sidelines, George Bush has finally admitted that
there is something wrong with a federal furlough program that gives
45-day vacations to drug traffickers,'' Bentsen said in a statement
issued in Washington.
   The Bentsen said more than 7,000 drug offenders received
furloughs last year and 138 prisoners on federal furlough escaped
in 1986, including a man who hijacked a helicopter and returned to
prison to free his bank-robber girlfriend.
   Bush walked down the main thoroughfare of an Italian-American
neighborhood. He stopped at a bakery and at an athletic club, where
he briefly joined a game of pool. With a single shot, Bush drove a
purple ``4'' ball diagonally across the length of the table and
into a corner pocket, to the cheers of club patrons.
   The vice president returned to Washington at midday to prepare
for his second debate with Dukakis in Los Angeles on Thursday and
to play tennis with professional ace Pam Shriver and members of the
Bush family.
   The vice president has frequently visited New Jersey, which his
campaign officials regarded as a crucial election battleground with
its 16 electoral votes.
   ``We're going after Reagan Democrats. You're not going to see
many Republicans here,'' Richard Bond, the campaign's political
director, told reporters during the tour of the Chambersburg
section of Trenton.
   Reagan Democrats are traditionally Democratic voters who voted
for President Reagan in 1980 and 1984.
   Bush aides were heartened by a poll in Sunday's editions of The
Record of Hackensack showing him leading Dukakis by eight
percentage points in New Jersey.
   Asked by reporters if he thought the debate performance of
running mate Dan Quayle had hurt the GOP ticket in the polls, Bush
replied: ``The only poll I heard of, I like very much.''
   He was referring to a survey by the Atlanta Constitution and
Journal which showed Bush with a solid lead over Dukakis in 15
Southern states.
   But, Bush said, ``How can I say I believe in polls? I'm the guy
that's been getting kicked in them not so many days ago.''
   Bush leaves Tuesday for an eight-day campaign swing that will
include the Thursday debate and at least four days of campaigning
in California.

<TEXT>
   The Dalai Lama said he will shun
politics if Tibet gains independence from China and any talks he
has with the Chinese will center on Tibet's future, not on his own
return home.
   The exiled spiritual leader said he would stay out of any future
government because his status as god-king of Tibetan Buddhists
would inhibit the development of democracy.
   ``My participation would be a hindrance of a healthy democratic
athomsphere,'' he told a news conference at the Swedish
International Peace Research Insitute on the last stop of a Nordic
tour.
   ``Let the young, intelligent Tibetans carry the responsibility
for leading the government. I want to remain a simple Buddhist
monk.''
   He now leads a government-in-exile based in India.
   In a proposal to China this year, the Dalai Lama substituted
limited autonomy for his previous demand of immediate Tibetan
independence, but expressed the hope of independence in his
lifetime.
   The Dalai Lama left Tibet in 1959.
   Asked Monday when he thought he might be able to return, he
said: ``The issue is not my return but the fate of 6 million
people. When the situation inside Tibet becomes satisfactory, then
the refugees will return, including myself.''
   He urged China to ease restrictions on tourists and journalists
``and let them judge'' whether the country is as calm as the
Chinese claim.
   Government officials in Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden did
not meet him officially during this tour because Chinese embassies
let it be known Beijing would not approve.
   The Dalai Lama called his visit ``non-political,'' and said he
had ``no special thing to say'' to Scandinavian governments.
   During five days in Sweden, he plans to address the Foreign
Policy Institute and attend public peace functions.

   Pope John Paul II on Monday urged the
creation of a new economic system providing greater employment as
he toured the rust-belt area of northeastern France.
   John Paul has made the dignity of work and the need for jobs a
persistent theme of his 10-year papacy and one which figured
prominently in his speeches in Metz and Nancy on the third day of
his four-day visit to the Alsace-Lorraine region.
   The pope also announced he was sending a letter of encouragement
to inmates in French jails.
   In Strasbourg, a shouting match broke out during the opening
session of the European Parliament over the speech the pope was
scheduled to deliver Tuesday. Niall Andrews, an Irish Catholic
conservative, accused the Rev. Ian Paisley of planning to disrupt
the speech.
   He called Paisley, another parliamentarian and leader of the
hard-line Irish Protestant Democratic Unionist Party, ``an
institutional terrorist.'' Paisley shouted back that he opposed
both the pope and the Roman Catholic Church and that he planned to
express his opposition during the pontiff's address.
   In Nancy, John Paul told more than 40,000 faithful jammed into a
square that economic and social problems should not blind them to
the presence of God in the world.
   ``Certain human hopes seem to be sinking,'' said the 68-year-old
pontiff, wearing a bright red cape and speaking under a white,
cone-shaped canopy.
   He said mines and heavy industries that once flourished are in
decline, and demanded that ``a whole new economic restructuring be
invented and put in place'' to solve the unemployment dilemma.
   ``If faith does not dictate ready-made answers, it does provide
the courage to undertake the search, to seek the appropriate type
of development. ... It suggests that human work be re-evaluated in
accordance with the dignity of the person.''
   Although Alsace-Lorraine reports an unemployment rate only
slightly higher than the national average of 10.5 percent, the
jobless rate in industrial cities of the region is higher. The
decline in heavy industry and mining has particularly hurt
immigrants who came in waves from elsewhere in Europe and North
Africa during the industrial boom years of the 1960s and 1970s and
make up nearly 10 percent of the population of Metz and the
surrounding area.
   The pope complimented the region for welcoming foreigners and
called on residents to reject the secularizing trends that have
resulted in a sharp drop in French attendance at Mass since World
War II.
   Ultra-conservative elements of the Roman Catholic Church in
France have expressed concern about the large number of Moslem
immigrants. Islam, now the second-largest religion in France,
arrived with the influx of immigrants from North Africa.
   The conservative Catholics were prominent among the suporters of
National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who won 14 percent of the
vote in the first round of presidential balloting last spring and
campaigned against immigration.

<HEAD>PLO Officers Attack Military Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fistfight broke out Monday at the PLO
office here when 51 PLO military officers, angry at being retired,
attacked the office director and hurt three bodyguards, a
Palestinian official said.
   The spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Army, the regular
military wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said office
director Samir Khatib suffered facial bruises, but was in good
condition.
   Khatib's three bodyguards were hospitalized with ``minor
injuries,'' the spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said the officers called for a meeting with Khatib to discuss
their retirement plan and ``took the opportunity to attack him at
his office.''
   ``Probably they felt that obligations to them were not being
honored, although we paid them their salaries and compensation,''
the spokesman said.
   The Palestine Liberation Army operates under the supervision of
host countries. An estimated 1,500 Liberation Army soldiers are
based in Jordan.
   The spokesman said the retired officers broke office furniture,
destroyed files and tried to flee when Jordanian officers arrived
to arrest them. He said police are investigating.
   The spokesman said 40 of the officers had been retired because
they reached retirement age and 11 had been dismissed for ``bad
discipline'' but had been called back for reserve duty.
   Also Monday, PLO officials said the Palestine National Council _
the PLO's equivalent of a parliament-in-exile _ will move to form a
provisional government this month despite warnings that elections
in Israel and the United States will immediately block their
proposals.
   ``The success of great incidents cannot be linked to one
person,'' Hani el-Hassan, a senior aide to PLO chairman Yasser
Arafat, said Monday in Cairo, Egypt.
   ``The announcement of a state is an event based on logical
circumstances,' he said. ``The Palestinian people are their own
masters on their land and no American president or Israeli prime
minister can ignore that.
   ``An independence document and the announcement of a Palestinian
state will be presented to the Palestinian National Council in its
next meeting at the end of October,'' el-Hassan said.
   In Israel, a government source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Monday both Labor and Likud party blocs will reject
any pre-election proposal.
   Palestinian sources have said that Egypt and the Soviet Union
have been pressing Arafat to delay the meeting and the announcement
of the organization's future plans until after Israel's Nov. 1
election and the U.S. presidential vote Nov. 8.
   The PLO seeks to pressure the United States and Israel to
recognize the Palestinians' right to self-determination and break
the impasse in peace negotiations.
   The steps, to be sanctioned by an emergency meeting of the
Palestine National Council, are expected to include a declaration
of independence for the occupied territories and formation of a
Palestinian provisional government.
   Another Arafat aide, Salah Khalaf, was quoted by the Kuwaiti
newspaper Al-Qabas as saying leaders of various Palestinian
guerrilla groups have ``unanimously adopted a decision to set up an
independent Palestinian state and declare sovereignty on
Palestinian land.''
   Khalaf emphasized that the Palestine National Council meeting
will be held before the Israeli elections and said ``This is our
final decision,'' the newspaper reported.
   The mounting casualties in the 10 months of riots against
Israel's military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
persuaded some leaders that the PLO must act quickly to gain
politically from the confrontations.
   They also want to strengthen PLO links with the 1.5 million
Palestinians there following King Hussein's July decision to sever
Jordan's administrative links with the occupied lands.

   Trumpets blared and fireworks lit the sky
Monday night as President Hosni Mubarak inaugurated Cairo's new
Opera House, 17 years after fire destroyed the one built a century
ago for the opening of the Suez Canal.
   Japan paid for the $50 million ivory-colored, neo-Islamic
cultural complex, which is officially called the Cairo Education
and Culture Center and presented the first Kabuki theater
performance on the Nile. Its unofficial name is the Opera House,
for the building destroyed by fire in 1971.
   Floodlights bathed the ivory domes as officials and members of
the art world walked into the 1,300-seat main theater Monday night.
   The center represents Japan's largest aid outlay for a project
with a primarily cultural function. Mubarak specifically requested
money for such a project during a visit to Japan in 1983.
   Because of Emperor Hirohito's grave illness, the Japanese royal
family was not represented at the inaugural. Official Japanese
parties and receptions were canceled.
   Kajima Corp. began construction 40 months ago. The complex was
completed ahead of schedule and turned over to Egypt last March.
   On Monday night, vans full of security police stood by the white
gates and traffic was diverted from the area. Hundreds of people
gathered near the gates, and between mounted soldiers on a nearby
bridge, to catch watch the pomp and ceremony.
   Mubarak arrived in a convoy of at least 10 Mercedes automobiles,
preceded by Cabinet ministers. He unveiled a plaque and cut a
ribbon.
   In the rose-colored hall Egypt's national anthem played before
the Japanese music-dance drama performed by male actors dressed in
exquisite costumes.
   Khedive Ismail built the original Opera House, which was
inaugurated in 1869 as part of an extravagent Suez Canal
dedication. Ismail commissioned the opera ``Aida'' from the
Giuseppe Verdi for the opening, but the Italian composer did not
finish it in time and the work premiered in the Opera House two
years later.
   Two bronze sculptures recovered from the ashes in 1971 stand at
either end of the lawn in the new complex on Gezira Island in the
Nile, one of Cairo's wealthiest quarters.
   In addition to the main space, the Education and Culture Center
also has two smaller theaters, a museum, an art gallery, a
conference hall and training facilities.
   Japanese artists worked until less than two months ago with
complex director Magda Saleh to prepare the opening night's Kabuki
performance and for later musical and ballet shows.
   Then a new director, Ratiba Hefny, was named without explanation.
   ``We weren't even told officially about the change until two
weeks after it was made,'' said Hiroshi Shiojiri, first secretary
for cultural affairs at the Japanese Embassy.
   Customs officials also had delayed the arrival of 40 crates of
equipment and luggage for Monday night's show. Officials said they
held up baggage because of a rumor that a drug smuggler was on the
Egypt Air flight bringing the troupe of 50 from Tokyo.
   The baggage was delivered later.
   ``The Japanese give grants only for educational, not cultural,
purposes,'' said Mohammed Salmawi of the Culture Ministry. ``So we
agreed to call it an educational and cultural center, but it's
really mainly cultural.''
   Kajima employed about 500 Egyptians on the project with 30
Japanese engineers and administrators.
   The opening prompted last-minute cleanup jobs on Gezira Island.
   Four huge bronze lions guarding the bridge were washed down,
nearby buildings painted and fences mended. Workers planted
greenery and cleared trash from nearby plazas.
   Some Egyptians grumble about so much money being spent on a
complex to bring basically alien culture to the nation. They say
Egypt, with a population of 54 million and a per capita annual
income of $600, would be served better by a hospital, low-cost
housing or schools.

<HEAD>Opera With Character Modeled After Jimmy Swaggart Opens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An opera director who once staged ``Antony and
Cleopatra'' in a swimming pool is now portraying the main character
of Richard Wagner's opera ``Tannhaeuser'' as a fallen television
evangelist.
   Peter Sellars' production of ``Tannhaeuser'' was set to open
Monday at the Chicago Lyric opera.
   ``I want people to realize that `Tannhaeuser' is about Wagner's
own fleshly struggles and his invention of his own morality,''
Sellars said.
   In Wagner's opera, Tannhaeuser is a German knight in the Middle
Ages who is in love with a virtuous woman, but who also indulges in
orgies with the pagan goddess, Venus. He eventually achieves
salvation through a miracle.
   Sellars' ``Tannhaeuser,'' is set in a Nevada motel room with the
hero modeled after televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who made a tearful
televised confession last February that he had committed an
unspecified sin against God and his family.
   ``There were a lot of parallels between Jimmy Swaggart and
Wagner _ both were cult figures who cloaked themselves in public
religiosity and promoted themselves shamelessly,'' Sellars said.
``We admire them, sure, but we also, in a strange way, distrust
them.''
   Sellars, 31, says he wants to shock people into a greater
understanding of Wagner's opera.
   ``I want to give people something profound and sad and beautiful
to think about,'' he said.
   Sellars, whose recent operatic triumphs include last year's
acclaimed production of ``Nixon In China,'' was invited to Chicago
to do ``Tannhaeuser'' so audiences could get a taste of
contemporary opera, says Ardis Krainik, general director of the
Lyric Opera.
   ``Peter Sellars is, without question, one of the present-day
musical theater geniuses of America,'' Ms. Krainik said. ``There's
always a lot of controversy surrounding Peter.''
   Sellar's production credits range from the odd to bizarre. He
once set Mozart's ``Cosi Fan Tutti'' in a diner and set the same
composer's ``The Marriage of Figaro'' in the Trump Tower. His only
previous experience with Wagner was a condensed version of ``The
Ring of The Niebelung'' _ done with puppets in a Denver shopping
mall.
   Sellars says he is happy with the controversy that surrounds his
work.
   ``I think it will be the first `Tannhaeuser' that will feel
active,'' he said. ``People will say `My god, there's a lot
happening here.' ''

   Communist authorities put more
police on the streets and imposed unspecified ``urgent measures''
in Montenegro's capital Monday, but protests kept up, fed by
economic crisis and ethnic tension.
   Protest has swept much of southern and eastern Yugoslavia in
recent weeks. Police used violent tactics for the first time over
the weekend to disperse Montenegrin students and workers demanding
dismissal of local Communist Party leaders.
   Several Yugoslavs reported that civil defense units in Belgrade
were put on a higher level of alert Saturday. The sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   No sign of trouble surfaced in Belgrade.
   President Raif Dizdarevic appealed for calm on national
television Sunday night, warning of unspecified emergency measures.
   Yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous
provinces, each with its own government and Communist Party
structure.
   Unrest persisted Monday in Titograd, the capital of Montenegro
280 miles southwest of Belgrade, and the regional party leadership
held an emergency meeting, the official news agency Tanjug reported.
   About 15,000 people at Niksic, 30 miles north of Titograd,
joined 2,800 striking steelworkers Monday for a street rally,
Tanjug said. Twelve demonstrators were detained there Sunday night.
   Police used clubs and tear gas to break up weekend crowds in
Titograd and to disperse marchers in Niksic who were on their way
to Titograd.
   The Titograd rally was an explosion of anger over hardships
resulting from the austerity program imposed by the government in
May because of a $21 billion foreign debt and an annual inflation
rate of 217 percent. The unemployment rate is about 15 percent.
   Concern for Montenegrins in southern Serbia's troubled Kosovo
province also has stirred passions. Serbs and Montenegrins in
Kosovo, most of them Christians, are a minority to the mainly
Moslem ethnic Albanian population.
   Tanjug reported, without details, that ``urgent measures'' were
imposed Monday in Titograd. It said later 1,000 construction
workers called off a strike after local party leaders promised to
consider their demands.
   An official reached at the government information office in
Titograd reported more police patrols in some parts of the city and
said civilian defense units were told ``to display special
vigilance and prevent any repetition of the unrest of the past
weekend.''
   He said steps would be taken to ease shortages of meat, bread
and cooking oil.
   In Belgrade, the federal government said it was rescinding a
28.5 percent increase in electricity prices announced Oct. 1.
   Workers in Titograd blame local party leaders for the economic
troubles and demand they be dismissed.
   The party leadership in Vojvodina, an autonomous province of
Serbia, was dismissed last week after a similar public outcry.
   Protesters in Niksic demanded Monday that Montenegro's police
chief be fired because of the weekend violence, dramatizing their
point by hoisting a man wearing a gas mask on the shoulders of the
crowd, Tanjug reported.
   ``We are not demanding the gallows for those who ordered the
beating up of our comrades, we are only demanding their sacking,''
the agency quoted worker Miloslav Michunovich as saying.
   Monday's rallies in Montenegro were largely the work of those
who support Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian Communist Party leader
who is popular among Serbs and Montenegrins for his defense of
their fellow Slavs in Kosovo.
   Two of Yugoslavia's six republics _ Slovenia and Bosnia
Herzegovina _ issued statements supporting Dizdarevic's
denunciation of nationalist protests.
   But the leadership in Serbia defended its drive for more control
of its two provinces, which are nominally autonomous.
   That indicated a showdown between rival politicians and
republics at a key meeting set for Oct. 17 to decide changes in the
national Communist Party leadership.
   Stern response to protests could work against Milosevic, who
opponents fear will ride the wave of ethnic emotion to greater
national power.

<HEAD>Wife Wants Pinochet To Run; Spokesman Says It's Too Soon to Tell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of President Augusto Pinochet
apparently wants her husband to stay in office, but his chief of
staff said Monday it's too early to discuss whether the general
will run in the open presidential election next year.
   Pinochet has said nothing on the issue, but the widely read
conservative daily El Mercurio on Monday quoted Pinochet's wife,
Lucia, as urging supporters to ``form a grand support movement so
that the president will change the constitution and can be
re-elected.''
   It said Mrs. Pinochet made the comment Sunday at the couple's
summer retreat, Bucalemu.
   When asked whether the 72-year-old general might run in the
election, planned for December 1989, Orlando Poblete told reporters
the question was ``premature.''
   Poblete is secretary-general of the military government, a
Cabinet-level post similar to chief of staff. He spoke after the
15-member Cabinet met with Pinochet, who lost a plebiscite last
week on extending his presidency to 1997.
   Pinochet ``ratified his confidence in our carrying out the
functions of our various portfolios'' and discussed the economic,
social and political future, Poblete said. All Cabinet members
offered their resignations after the plebiscite defeat, but
Pinochet rejected them.
   Lawyers disagree on whether Pinochet's 1980 consitution allows
him to be a candidate in open elections.
   Most, including several supporters, say he cannot because of the
stipulation that presidents cannot succeed themselves. The general
seized power in September 1973, ousting the elected government of
President Salvador Allende, an avowed Marxist who died in the coup.
   Defense Minister Patricio Carvajal, a retired admiral, said
lawyers told him Pinochet could run ``if he stepped down a little
before'' the election, in which case there would be an interim
president and Pinochet technically would not be succeeding himself.
   Carvajal told reporters he thought changing the constitution
``could be more complicated'' than stepping down before the vote.
   Pinochet received 3.1 million ``yes'' votes in last Wednesday's
vote _ about 840,000 fewer than the ``no'' votes promoted by his
political opposition. Even in defeat he remains in power until
March 11, 1990, when the winner of the 1989 general elections is to
take office under terms of the constitution.
   Opposition leaders want it amended to move up the election and
Pinochet's departure. The general has said he will not permit
changes and will serve out his term.

<TEXT>
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov scolded North Atlantic
Treaty Organization nations on Monday for trying to extract
concessions from Moscow in negotiations aimed at reducing
conventional forces in Europe, Tass reported.
   Ryzhkov's attack came in a speech at a Kremlin dinner honoring
Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, who came to the Soviet capital
on Monday for four days of talks with Soviet officials.
   ``Regrettably, some NATO countries' delegations are still unable
to overcome the temptation of pressing the socialist countries yet
one more time in a bid to gain concessions,'' Ryzhkov said.
   Eastern and Western European countries have been trying for
years in Vienna, the Austrian capital, to agree on mutual cuts in
conventional arms and troops on the continent.
   Western countries, led by the United States, have claimed that
purported Soviet superiority in these forces has become more of a
threat now that the superpowers are scrapping their medium- and
shorter-range nuclear missiles worldwide.
   Ryzhkov said the Vienna talks could be sucessfully completed
soon if it were not for what he said was the West's intransigence.
   Tass did not immediately report Vranitzky's speech or indicate
whether he responded to Ryzhkov's charges about the conventional
force talks.
   Earlier in the day, the two met privately.

   A powerful beam striking the Earth from
a twin star system 14,000 light years away could herald a new type
of particle that physicists said confounds the standard theories of
physics.
   The beam, carrying a million billion electron volts of energy,
comes from a neutron star, half of a binary star system named
Hercules X-1 in the constellation Hercules, said Dr. Guarang Yodh,
a physicist at the University of California at Irvine.
   The neutron star is nearly the size of Earth's moon, but is
extremely dense with a mass nearly double the sun's.
   The other half of the star system, about 4 million miles from
the neutron star, is a star similar to the sun.
   The neutron star is a large, spinning magnet, generating massive
electromagnetic fields and giving off powerful radiation.
   The beam, first detected at Los Alamos National Laboratory in
July 1986, initially was believed to be electrically neutral gamma
rays, which are high-energy light waves or photons.
   The problem with that interpretation was that the beam ``hits
way up in the atmosphere and produces a shower of particles,'' Yodh
said Friday in a telephone interview.
   Gamma rays are not supposed to do that, said Dr. Darragh Nagle,
a physicist at the Los Alamos lab.
   ``That's the thing that's interesting and puzzling about the
finding,'' he said. ``There is the possible presence of a new
particle that is coming out of the study of a powerful neutral beam.
   ``It isn't the power of the neutral beam; it's this peculiar
interaction in the Earth's atmosphere,'' Nagle said in a telephone
interview.
   Yodh said the discovery should lead to new insights about
sources of energy in the universe and about the elementary
structure of matter.
   ``Both of them are extremely relevant to our understanding of
our universe. I think that is the main impact it will make on
society,'' Yodh said.
   Yodh said scientists have come up with several explanations for
the strange beam, which also has been detected by observatories in
Arizona and Hawaii. One explanation is that it is made of a
previously unknown particle.
   ``It is unexplainable by conventional theory, present-day
knowledge,'' Yodh said.
   Scientists delayed in publishing their findings because they
have been rechecking their research and trying to come up with an
explanation, he said.
   ``We've been trying to make it go away. We've been trying to say
it's some mistake. But we can't,'' Yodh said.
   A technical paper on the research will soon be published in the
international scientific journal ``Physical Review Letters,'' Nagle
said.

   O-ring seals in the joints of space
shuttle Discovery's left booster rocket suffered no damage during
last month's launch, NASA reported Monday as workers began
disassembling the right booster.
   The shuttle Challenger was destroyed and its crew of seven lost
on Jan. 28, 1986, when superhot gas and flames burned through the
synthetic rubber O-rings in a faulty joint in one of its boosters.
   Discovery's Sept. 28 launch was the first since the accident,
and its two solid fuel rockets burned for two minutes as planned
and then parachuted into the Atlantic Ocean, where they were
recovered and returned to the Kennedy Space Center for inspection.
   Officials reported earlier that an initial inspection after
recovery indicated the rockets were in excellent condition.
   Ed Medal, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.,
reported late Monday that engineers had completed dismantled both
booster rockets.
   ``All six field joints were taken apart and looked at,'' he
said. ``Everything looks great. There was no evidence of hot gas or
heat on any of the O-rings. The new bonded installation did its
job.''
   There are three joints in each of the 149-foot-tall rockets.
Each joint has three O-rings.
   He said new insulation added to the joint area also worked as
intended in keeping burning gases away from the rings.
   On Challenger, each joint had two O-rings. In redesigning the
rocket, engineers at the Marshall center and at Morton Thiokol, the
manufacturer, added a third O-ring as part of a metal lip, called a
capture feature, intended to prevent joint movement under pressure
of ignition.
   Discovery and its five-man crew landed at Edwards Air Force Base
in California on Oct. 3 after a four-day flight during which the
astronauts deployed a communications satellite, conducted
experiments and tested new orbiter systems.
   The shuttle was ferried back to Canaveral on Saturday, riding
piggyback atop a modified Boeing 747 jetliner. It was back at its
launch site Monday, being inspected in a processing facility at the
Kennedy Space Center.
   Discovery's crew will describe their mission at a news
conference Tuesday at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   NASA officials said Discovery returned to Earth in good shape
and would require little refurbishment. Once a few protective
thermal tiles have been replaced, workers will begin preparing it
for its next flight, scheduled Feb. 18, with another communications
satellite as the cargo.
   Meanwhile, Atlantis is being readied in an adjoining processing
bay for the next shuttle flight, a classified Defense Department
mission set for launch in late November.
   A payload for a future mission arrived Saturday by truck from a
Martin Marietta plant near Denver, Colo. It is the unmanned
Magellan spacecraft scheduled to be released from Atlantis' cargo
bay in April to explore the planet Venus.

   East Berlin security officials broke up a protest
march by about 200 activists Monday, detained dozens and roughed up
West German journalists, witnesses said.
   The demonstrators were protesting government censorship of
Lutheran Church newspapers.
   Communist East Germany's official news agency ADN said about 80
people were ``momentarily detained'' for ``going against state
measures for public order'' but were released after a warning.
   It made no mention of any rough treatment.
   West Germany issued a statement saying the incident was ``in
crass contradiction'' to human rights accords and ``violates the
(West German-East German) agreement'' on journalists' coverage of
events in East Germany.
   In its evening news broadcast, the West German television
network ZDF showed East German plainclothes security officials
shoving demonstrators and West German journalists covering the
march.
   It said ZDF correspondent Michael Schmitz was struck in the
stomach by a security official.
   Demonstrators, many singing protest songs, were loaded into
trucks and taken away.
   The protesters carried banners saying ``Press Freedom for the
Church.'' Some demonstrators carried children on their shoulders.
   Police broke up the march after the protesters had gone about
100 yards, witnesses said.

   A federal judge Monday acquitted one of two
Indian activists on a hostage-taking charge in the takeover of a
newspaper office, but let stand weapons charges against both
defendants.
   U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle, in dismissing the charge
against Timothy Jacobs, said his reading of the statute showed that
a demand on the government had to be ``not just incidental, but
material.''
   Boyle said he would let the jury decide if co-defendant Eddie
Hatcher was guilty of the charge.
   ``We have achieved a great victory,'' Jacobs' attorney, Lewis
Pitts, said at a news conference during a court recess. ``We
predicted several months ago that the federal hostage-taking
charges would be dropped and they have been, at least against
Jacobs.
   ``We believe the judge should have, in fact, ordered an
acquittal on those charges against Eddie Hatcher,'' Pitts said.
``It underscores how unfair it is to Eddie not to have his lawyer
with him.''
   Boyle ordered Hatcher to represent himself after Hatcher refused
to accept other counsel. His attorney, William Kunstler, is
involved in a case in New York and has been unable to participate
in Hatcher's trial.
   Attorneys for Jacobs argued Friday that prosecutors had failed
to prove that he and Hatcher had made a demand on the federal
government during their takeover of The Robesonian newspaper in
Lumberton on Feb. 1.
   ``The court is of the opinion that it is premature concerning
the evidence with respect to defendant Hatcher to make a ruling and
that this should proceed to the jury,'' Boyle said.
   But he said prosecutors had presented no evidence that Jacobs
had made a demand on the government or had aided Hatcher in making
a demand.
   The hostage-taking charge was linked with a second charge of
committing a violent crime with an illegal firearm. Boyle also
dismissed that charge against Jacobs.
   Hatcher and Jacobs still face charges of conspiracy, making an
illegal firearm, possessing an unregistered firearm and conveying
false information concerning explosives.
   In a written order, Boyle advised defense attorneys that he
would not accept their ``necessity defense.'' The judge said there
was no direct relationship between the hostages taken at The
Robesonian and the threats perceived by Hatcher and Jacobs.
   The two had argued that their lives were in jeopardy because of
information they said linked law enforcement officers to drug
trafficking in Robeson County. They claimed they had no choice but
to take hostages at the newspaper to publicize their case.
   But Boyle wrote that the action should have been taken against
the people who posed the threat, not innocent people.
   Pitts said that decision would force lawyers to try an alternate
defense.
   ``The judge in his ruling said allowing the `necessity defense'
would create chaos and anarchy, but chaos and anarchy already
existed in Robeson County prior to Feb. 1,'' Pitts said.
   Monday afternoon, Hatcher attempted to call one witness and
questioned another witness, ending his two-week refusal to
participate in the trial. Hatcher agreed to question former
Pembroke Police Chief Kirby Ammons, who had been called by Jacobs'
attorneys.
   ``I'm not an attorney, but yes, sir, I do have some questions,''
Hatcher responded when Boyle asked him if he wished to question
Ammons.
   ``Did you not tell me my life was in danger with this
information I had?'' Hatcher asked Ammons, referring to alleged
information on drug dealing involving law enforcement officers.
   ``I don't remember that,'' Ammons said.
   Hatcher also attempted to call a witness to the stand, but Boyle
said he would hear defense evidence for Jacobs first and then hear
from Hatcher.

<HEAD>Alleged Hungarian Spies Say They Approached CIA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungarian-born brothers charged with
spying against NATO said Monday they approached the CIA about
selling classified material but were turned down, according to a
news report of the trial.
   Sandor and Imre Kercsik, naturalized Swedish citizens ages 48
and 34 respectively, were arrested in August after a spy ring
allegedly run by former U.S. Army Sgt. Clyde Lee Conrad was
uncovered.
   Conrad was stationed at a NATO base in West Germany and had
access to classified data on operations of the Western alliance. He
faces espionage charges that carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in
prison.
   The trial of the Kercsik brothers began Monday at Molndal
District Court outside Goteborg in southwestern Sweden.
   The report said the brothers told the court Conrad invented an
imaginary high-ranking intelligence officer named David in Hungary,
then had them write a letter offering classified material and
saying Conrad wanted to defect.
   According to the Swedish news agency TT, the brothers testified
the CIA paid tens of thousands of dollars for sample material but
ended the contacts later because of dissatisfaction with the
information.
   It said the brothers contested prosecutor Sven Olof Hakansson's
suggestion they wanted to approach the West out of fear of being
disclosed as East bloc agents, saying their only aim was getting
money from the Americans.
   The agency's report said Conrad tricked the brothers by
inventing a man named Mike who provided information from the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and saying he needed money to pay the
fictitious agent.
   According to the charges, the Kercsik brothers were couriers in
Europe for Conrad, who sold NATO secrets to Hungary.
   Hungary enlisted the elder brother in the 1960s and the younger
in 1980, they told the court, and they were pressured by agents who
constantly reminded them of their sister and ailing mother in
Hungary.
   They have denied espionage charges, claiming they did not
collect secret material but only acted as couriers. The defense
says they did not operate in Sweden and their activities were not
directed against this neutral nation.

<TEXT>
   Israel inoculated more than 500,000 residents
against polio Monday on the second day of a nationwide vaccination
campaign that began after nine cases of the paralyzing disease were
diagnosed.
   Israeli television meanwhile reported that two infants from
northern Israel were hospitalized with symptoms of the disease.
Their diagnosis has not yet been confirmed, hospital officials said.
   Polio was thought to be eradicated in the region, and the recent
cases have been blamed on inadequate sewage systems.
   Health Ministry spokesman Shmuel Algrabli said 1.4 million
Israelis have been inoculated since the country was alerted last
month.
   The army's Civil Administration began vaccinating Palestinian
residents of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip Sunday, Algrabli
said.
   ``There have been no problems with the intefadeh in this
regard,'' he said, referring to the 10-month-old Palestinian revolt
against Israeli rule. ``We have had the complete cooperation of the
residents and the physicians.''
   No figure was available on the number of Arab residents
inoculated.
   The campaign, to encompass 3.2 million Israelis under 40 years
of age and more than 1 million Palestinians in the same age group,
is expected to be over in four weeks.
   Tourists planning to visit Israel do not need an extra polio
vaccination but those now in the country may be inoculated free of
charge, the Health Ministry said.

<HEAD>Eight Guerrillas Killed In Attack on Jungle Police Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUANCAYO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight leftist guerrillas were killed when
an outmanned police force repelled a rebel attack in Peru's eastern
Amazon jungle, officials in this state capital said Monday.
   About 100 combatants of the Mao-inspired Shining Path guerrilla
group attacked the police post in Villa Rica, 100 miles north of
here, before dawn Sunday, police officials said.
   The 20 police troopers inside the post drove off the rebels, who
were armed with automatic weapons and dynamite, without suffering
casualties, according to the police report.
   The rebels dynamited and torched three government offices during
the attack on Villa Rica, a town of 8,000 inhabitants.
   Police in Huancayo, in the Andean highlands 140 miles east of
Lima, said the attack lasted 45 minutes before the rebels withdrew
into the surrounding jungle, leaving their dead behind.
   They said blood stains along the road used by the escaping
rebels indicated some of them were wounded.
   Officials said police reinforcements left Huancayo Monday to
pursue the guerrilla column.
   Villa Rica is in a lumber and coffee-growing region. Many of the
area's residents are descendants of German immigrants from the last
century.
   Police said it was the first time guerrillas have attacked Villa
Rica.
   The Shining Path launched its insurgency in Peru's southern
highlands in 1980 to overthrow the elected government.
   Since then the fighting has spread to coastal cities and into
Peru's eastern jungles, and more than 12,000 people have died.

   Publisher Malcolm Stevenson Forbes, as
usual, made Forbes Magazine's list of the 400 richest people in
America, and as usual, he chose not to disclose his own wealth.
   Forbes has kept his net worth a closely guarded secret, and
aides to the publishing mogul contend that he may not even know
where he falls on the list.
   Saying no official wealth estimate is available, the magazine
has made him No. 113 on the list, between Laszlo Nandor Tauber,
worth $500 million, and John Thomas Lupton, worth $480 million.
   But really, how much is he worth?
   ``One thing I can say for sure, he's definitely worth between
$225 million and $6 billion,'' said Harold Seneker, a Forbes editor.
   Being publisher has its privileges for the Far Hills
million-or-billionaire. In short, he doesn't publish how much he's
worth because he doesn't have to.
   ``There is no (dollar figure) for him simply because he feels
it's his prerogative as owner of the magazine not to release his
net worth,'' said Forbes spokesman Ray Healey. ``He just chooses to
keep it to himself.''
   But really, how much is he worth?
   ``I don't think he even knows what it is and I don't think he's
in any hurry to have it figured out,'' said Don Garson, director of
corporate communications for Forbes.
   It would be unfair to Forbes to print his worth, Garson said,
because the dollar figures for the other 399 people listed are
presumed estimated, and Forbes' would be presumed factual since it
is his magazine.
   While the Oct. 24 issue includes outsiders' estimates of Forbes'
worth, they range dramatically. The London Daily Mail guesses $400
million, Newsday estimates his worth between $400 million and $700
million, and New York's Daily News simply says he's a
``billionaire.''
   Forbes, 69, owns American Heritage magazine, Somerset Press, a
400-square-mile Colorado ranch, a South Sea island, a London
mansion and a French chateau, among other holdings.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz on
Monday warned America to steer clear of protectionism and
isolation, which he said is an ingredient in ``a recipe for
economic and political disaster, not success.''
   Shultz said the concept of democratic and free market values is
taking hold in Latin America, Asia and Africa, and ``the failure of
the socialist command model has become plain to everybody.''
   ``The tide of Marxism, and with it communism as a model for
development, is a tide that is going out,'' he told the Financial
Executives Institute.
   Shultz said he was surprised but pleased with a call for a freer
economy by the new chief ideologist in the Soviet Union.
   ``I had to keep pinching myself. This is a communist talking,''
he said.
   But, Shultz said, ``the words he says are important words.''
   Shultz referred to a speech by Vadim A. Medvedev, published last
week in Pravda, in which the Kremlin ideologist called for
borrowing ideas from the West in order to restructure the Soviet
economy.
   Medvedev spoke of expanding to heavy industry the experiments
already under way on cooperatives and rentals for farmers and small
entrepreneurs.
   Shultz related the Soviet official's statement to a worldwide
expansion of the open market system, and in an obvious nod to the
Soviet Union's ``glasnost,'' or ``openness'' reform policy, the
secretary used the English word himself some half-dozen times.
   ``The big communist countries, China and the Soviet Union, are
also discovering these truths,'' he said.
   ``We will welcome the actions and ideas of others on the world
stage _ whether developed or developing, capitalist or communist _
if they are pared to promoting openness and world economic
growth,'' he said.
   Shultz, in a swipe at the ``stifling regulatory overlay on much
of Europe,'' added, ``It would be a tragic irony for a group of
nations to create a common market among themselves and then erect
new trade barriers against countries outside its bounds.''
   Reminding the financial officers that the world economy cannot
get along without the United States and the economic clout it
represents, Shultz added: ``In order to ensure continued national
and global economic expansion, the U.S. budget and trade deficits
must shrink _ the sooner the better.''
   He counseled not to forget that ``the wealth and size of our
market are vital to many countries and to the world economy.
American purchases of manufactured goods from developing countries
nearly doubled between 1982 and 1986, from $41 billion to $81
billion.''

   Three wildfires in southern California
burned nearly 3,000 acres and left two firefighters injured Monday.
   The fires were blamed on arson, a poorly tended campfire and
sparks from target practice ricochets. Dry desert winds and
temperatures topping 100 degrees aggravated firefighting efforts.
   California Department of Forestry Capt. Dave Howard was caught
in a firestorm as he battled a 700-acre arson blaze about 85 miles
southeast of Los Angeles and suffered severe burns to about half
his body, said CDF spokesman Tim Span.
   Howard, one of about 200 firefighters working the blaze, was
airlifted to the burn center at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital in
Los Angeles, where he was listed in critical but stable condition,
Span said.
   The other injury was to a female jail inmate who had been put to
work on a fire line. The woman suffered burns over a small portion
of her body. She was treated at the jail.
   An 1,800-acre blaze in Riverside County blackened 1,800 acres
after a campfire spread to nearby brush on Sunday, Span said. And
in San Bernardino County, a 200-acre brush fire sparked Sunday by
gunfire ricochets off scrap metal briefly threatened homes before
it was encircled early Monday.

<HEAD>Panama To Boycott Canal Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALINA GUERRERO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official said Monday the
government will not send delegates to a Panama Canal Commission
meeting because the United States invited an ambassador loyal to
ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   Oyden Ortega, one of four Panamanian delegates to the
commission, said the United States also denied entry visas for two
delegates to attend the Oct. 12-13 meeting in New Orleans.
   Ortega told a news conference the United States had invited Juan
B. Sosa, whom it recognizes as Panama's ambassador to Washington,
to the meeting.
   He said Sosa's presence ``introduces an element of politics into
the Canal Commission meetings, and an institutional meeting would
have been preferable.''
   Ortega called the invitation ``one more maneuver by the U.S.
government to impede the adequate execution of the Panama Canal
Treaties.''
   He said Panama would send a document to U.S. commission members
stating that its decision to boycott the meeting did not affect
Panama's compliance with canal treaty obligations.
   ``At no time is Panama abandoning its responsibility'' in
commission matters, he said.
   The commission oversees administration of the canal until Dec.
31, 1999, when Panama is to assume full responsibility for the
waterway that connects that Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
   Sosa served as Panama's envoy under Delvalle, who was deposed in
February after he tried to fire Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
Noriega, Panama's de facto ruler as head of the Defense Forces, is
under U.S. indictment on drug trafficking charges. Noriega denies
any wrongdoing.
   The Reagan administration continues to recognize Delvalle as
Panama's legitimate president.
   Ortega said the United States denied a visa to Maj. Daniel
Delgado, Panama's executive director for treaty affairs, for what
he called ``political declarations against the United States.''
Delegate Arnulfo Suarez also was denied a U.S. visa, but Ortega
declined to say why.
   In July, Panama ordered its commission representatives not to
attend a scheduled meeting in Savannah, Ga., because of U.S.
sanctions against Noriega.
   Board chairman William Gianetti said in July that Noriega also
was upset because the canal board canceled a meeting to be held in
Panama last April.
   In the Panamanians' absence, the five American members voted to
suspend commission regulations calling for at least two of its four
annual meetings to be held in Panama.

<TEXT>
   George Bush and Michael Dukakis courted the support of
Italian-Americans in competing Columbus Day appearances Monday that
left plenty of time to polish their lines in private for this
week's second and final presidential campaign debate.
   Dukakis proposed a plan to make it easier for first-time home
buyers to finance their residences before he marched in a Columbus
Day parade up Fifth Avenue in mid-town Manhattan alongside Gov.
Mario Cuomo, New York Mayor Ed Koch and John F. Kennedy Jr.
   Bush took a turn at a pool table in an Italian neighborhood in
New Jersey, bouncing the No. 4 ball in the corner pocket while the
morning patrons cheered. After that came a speech on crime.
   Their daily campaign rounds over, both men hustled back to their
political lairs to resume preparations for their prime-time debate
later in the week.
   Both camps said they expected the 90-minute debate to be held at
9 p.m. EDT Thursday night on the campus of UCLA, and the
presidential rivals were flying to the West Coast on Tuesday to
prepare.
   The candidates exuded confidence as they began the final four
weeks of campaigning, which opened with two new polls putting the
two candidates in a virtual dead heat.
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll Monday gave Bush 50 percent to
47 percent for Dukakis. The survey Wednesday through Sunday of 600
likely voters had a 5 point margin of error.
   The poll also gauged the negative impact of Quayle on the
Republican ticket. Of all the voters surveyed, 2 percent said they
favored Dukakis only because they disapproved of Sen. Dan Quayle,
the Republican vice presidential nominee. Six percent of the voters
said they supported Dukakis, and Quayle was the ``major'' reason.
   A Los Angeles Times released poll results Monday showing the
effects of Quayle's presence on the GOP ticket. The two tickets
were in a virtual dead heat _ 44 percent for the Republicans to 41
percent for the Democrats _ but Bush leads Dukakis 48-39 if the two
candidates are presented as running alone.
   The weekend survey of 893 registered voters also found that
Dukakis' negatives were very high _ he had a 45 percent unfavorable
rating _ compared with 40 percent unfavorable for Quayle. The
survey had a five-point margin of error on the questions about
presidential preference.
   Quayle was in Ohio and Michigan, where he offered another
refinement of the answer to the question in last week's debate that
plagued him _ what would he do if he suddenly became president.
   He said he would make a request to speak to the nation and would
consult with U.S. allies.
   ``Obviously you do different things under an assassination. The
first thing you do in an assassination _ I would still say a prayer
for myself and the nation _ but the first thing you do is you get
on the phone and call the head of the CIA and see what he thinks it
was. You don't convene a Cabinet meeting right away,'' Quayle said.
   ``You get your secretary of defense, your national security
adviser, your Secretary of State and meet with them immediately. In
the situation of an illness it would be a different type of
situation,'' he said.
   Dukakis attacked Bush's record on housing issues in his first
stop of the day.
   ``George Bush has no housing program. He has no solutions,'' the
Democrat said in a speech in Levittown, a Long Island community
that was the embodiment of the post-World War II boom in affordable
housing. ``He has no new ideas.''
   The vice president street-campaigned in New Jersey, walking
through an Italian neighborhood in south Trenton before delivering
a speech on crime.
   He proposed making it easier for victims to collect civil
judgments for restitution and allowing them to receive more money
automatically if a convict's financial situation improved.
   While refraining from the type of harsh attack on Dukakis' crime
record that has become a regular part of his campaigning, Bush
criticized ``liberal thinkers'' who he said ``thought it was
compassionate to lighten up on sentencing to allow early releases
and furloughs.''
   That was a muted remark directed at the Massachusetts prison
furlough program that Bush has repeatedly criticized during the
campaign. In one infamous incident, a murderer out of jail on a
furlough escaped and brutally attacked a Maryland couple.
   Bush told reporters aboard Air Force Two en route to New Jersey
that he favors a review of the federal furlough program but said he
doesn't have any ``specific feelings'' in mind. In a jab at
Dukakis, he added he wants to make sure the federal program doesn't
``slip into the Massachusetts model.''
   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen jabbed right
back at Bush, saying the federal program allowed more than 7,000
convicted drug offenders to receive furloughs last year.
   ``After 2,818 days of sitting on the sidelines, George Bush has
finally admitted that there is something wrong with a federal
furlough program that gives 45-day vacations to drug traffickers,''
Bentsen said in Washington.
   Campaigning in Levittown, Dukakis outlined a plan that he dubbed
``Home Start'' that would allow first-time home buyers to use their
Individual Retirement Account or tax-deferred pension savings for a
downpayment on a home. Current law prohibits the use of those funds
without payment of deferred taxes and in some cases, a penalty for
withdrawal.
   Dukakis said his program would also include provisions to lower
down payments and closing costs and to raise borrowing limits on
federally guaranteed mortgages. Aides said the federal government
would lose about $400 million in taxes that under current law would
have to be paid on IRAs and pension accounts but would be exempt
from taxes under the program.
   As a sign the Dukakis national campaign has lowered its sights
in Florida, that state's campaign director and political director
left Monday for assignments in Ohio. Eight other staffers have
already been transferred to Ohio or Michigan. There are no visits
to Florida scheduled for Dukakis or Bentsen.
   But the Democratic National Committee disputed the claim by
Republican strategists meeting Monday in Atlanta that the South is
theirs unless the campaigns become complacent.
   ``There's not a question in my mind that George Bush is going to
win every state in the South,'' Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater
said in Atlanta.
   Will Robinson, national political director of the Democratic
National Committee's Campaign '88, said: ``If the Republicans want
to take the South for granted, that's fine with us. They did that
two years ago and we won the Senate. Let them do it again this year
and we'll take the White House.''
   Robinson pointed to several polls showing Democratic candidates
behind in Senate races in 1986.

<HEAD>U.N. Chief Will Return To Geneva For Peace Talks</HEAD>

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Monday he will return to Geneva this month to mediate peace
talks between Iran and Iraq, but expressed misgivings about the
pace of the negotiations.
   ``I am satisfied in the sense that the meetings are useful, but
not in the sense that we are moving too slowly. The parties are
presenting their positions, and that takes time,'' the U.N. chief
said.
   He spoke to reporters after briefing the Security Council on his
meetings in New York over the last 10 days with foreign ministers
Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran and Tariq Aziz of Iraq.
   Perez de Cuellar said the date for resuming the talks is still
not settled, but will be announced soon. He indicated it would be
the last week of October.
   The secretary-general's decision to return to Geneva was seen as
a possible indication that he hopes for progress soon after the
talks resume.
   U.N. officials and sources close to the Iraqi and Iranian
delegations have said both sides agreed to a compromise suggested
by Perez de Cuellar to break a stalemate in the talks.
   The compromise involved the issues of Iran's searching ships in
the Persian Gulf and Iraq's insistence that the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway between the two countries be reopened.
   The U.N. and Iraqi sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said both Iran and Iraq will withdraw their troops to the
internationally recognized border and will discuss repatriating
prisoners of war.
   Perez de Cuellar also told council members Monday about his
recent visit to South Africa and Angola to discuss the Nov. 1
implementation date for an independence plan for South-West Africa,
or Namibia, ruled by South Africa in violation of U.N. resolutions.
   Iran and Iraq began fighting in September 1980, accepted a
U.N.-sponsored truce Aug. 20, and started peace negotiations five
days later in Geneva. The talks had moved to New York last month.

   A tractor-trailer truck slammed into the
back of a school bus Monday, injuring 16 students and both drivers
as the vehicles tumbled down an embankment, authorities said.
   Four students were seriously injured.
   The tractor-trailer, which was carrying brewer's grain, flipped
over once to land upright and the bus slid onto its side after
falling the 15 to 20 feet, witnesses said.
   The bus carried 20 students ages 5 through 17 on their way to
the Everett Area Elementary School and Everett Area High School.
   Bus driver Randy Mearkle, 33, of Everett, and 12 students were
treated for minor injuries and released at Memorial Hospital of
Bedford, said nursing supervisor Beth Arnold. Melissa Cottle, 10,
was hospitalized for a back injury and Jennifer Veach, 16, was
admitted for observation, she said.
   Truck driver Anthony W. Ritchie, 23, of Criders, Va., was also
admitted for observation.
   Candice Crawford, 15, and Jody Veach, 14, were transferred to
Conemaugh Valley Memorial Hospital in Johnstown, where they were
admitted in critical condition with head injuries, according to
hospital officials.
   Ritchie's truck hit the school bus shortly after 7:30 a.m. while
both were traveling northbound on the Pennsylvania 26 Bypass, said
Dick Weaver, state police communications operator in Bedford.
   The bus was hit from behind as it accelerated from a bus stop,
said Edward A. Vollbrecht, school district superintendent.
   ``He never stopped. ... I looked in the mirror and there he
was,'' said Mearkle, a bus driver for seven years. ``It was chaos.
The children were screaming.''
   The careening truck barely missed two students waiting for the
bus on the side of the road, witnesses said.
   Floyd Roberts of the Everett Volunteer Fire Department said some
students were taken to the hospital in a fire truck.
   ``Most of them were just shook up,'' Ms. Arnold said of the
students. ``They had a few cuts, bumps and bruises, but most of
them were fine. They were pretty good.''
   Everett, about 10 miles east of Bedford, has about 1,800
residents.

<TEXT>
   The recently elected premier of the Russian
republic was relieved Monday of his duties as interior minister,
the Soviet Union's top uniformed police official, Tass reported.
   Removal of Alexander Vlasov, also promoted to non-voting
membership on the ruling Politburo, as interior minister had been
expected after his election last week to the Russian premiership.
   Tass, the official news agency, said the decision was made by
the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's highest
executive body. It did not say who would be named interior minister.
   Vlasov, 56, received the premiership on the recommendation of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   He replaced Vitalty Vorotnikov as premier of the largest of the
15 republics that make up the Soviet Union. Vorotnikov was moved to
the largely ceremonial job of president of the Russian republic.
   Vlasov was named interior minister in early 1986 after serving
as Communist Party leader in Rostov, near Gorbachev's southern home
city of Stavropol.
   He was named to his new positions as part of a series of recent
changes in which Gorbachev retired several long-time Politburo
members, streamlined the work of the policy-making Central
Committee and moved key supporters into important jobs.

<HEAD>Polls Show Bush, Dukakis In Dead Heat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pair of surveys released Monday showed the
Republican ticket of George Bush and Dan Quayle ticket in a virtual
dead heat with Democrats Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, and
Quayle was seen as having a negative impact in both surveys.
   One of the surveys, by The Los Angeles Times, also showed that
Dukakis had a comparable negative rating with Quayle.
   The Times survey showed the Republican ticket leading the
Democratic ticket 44-41. But when Bush and Dukakis were pitted
against against each other without their respective running mates,
Bush led 48-39. A 5 point margin of error closed the difference in
both cases.
   In an ABC News-Washington Post poll, Bush had 50 percent to 47
percent for Dukakis. That survey also had a 5 point margin of error.
   The Times poll, conducted over the weekend by telephone, also
found that Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen far outperformed Quayle in last
week's vice presidential debate. But it also found that Dukakis had
a 45 percent unfavorable rating, compared with 40 percent
unfavorable rating for Quayle.
   The ABC-Post poll, in an effort to assess the Quayle ``drag''
among the electorate, found that 2 percent of all voters supported
Dukakis only because of their negative feelings about Quayle, and 6
percent said Quayle was the ``major'' reason for supporting Dukakis.
   The ABC-Post survey of 600 likely voters was conducted
nationwide by telephone from Wednesday through Sunday. The Times
survey of 893 registered voters was conducted over the weekend.
That group was split into two groups to ask the questions about the
ticket and the individual presidential contenders.

   Rebels in southern Sudan claimed Monday
that they killed 62 soldiers in a three-day battle that ended in
the capture of a small town near the Uganda border.
   The Sudan People's Liberation Army's clandestine radio said 300
government soldiers fled into Uganda on Friday when the guerrillas
captured Ikotos, a town in eastern Equatorial Province 46 miles
from the border.
   ``SPLA fighters have taken positions on the Sudanese side, but
because of the respect we have for international borders we cannot
cross into Uganda,'' the radio, monitored in Nairobi, said.
   ``We urge the fugitives to surrender. If they surrender without
their arms, no harm will be done to them.''
   The radio made no mention of rebel casualties and it was
immediately impossible to independently verify its report.
   The guerrilla group took up arms in 1983 against the
Moslem-dominated government in Khartoum, demanding more autonomy
for the mainly Christian and animist south. The rebel movement
claims control of 90 percent of the southern countryside and small
towns.
   Thousands of civilians fleeing the war and hunger headed to
larger towns or to northern Sudan, but relief officials say many
have starved to death on the way.

   A carbon dioxide tank exploded
at a plant that makes airplane and rocket parts Monday, killing at
least two people and injuring seven others, authorities said.
   The explosion at Reinhold Industries, which is about 15 miles
southeast of Los Angeles, occurred about 2:30 p.m., as employees
were installing a high-pressure molding machine, said Fire Marshal
Stan Boettcher. Several carbon dioxide cylinders were beside the
building, and one or more may have been hooked up to the machine,
he said.
   The blast caused telephone and electrical outages, said
Sheriff's Sgt. Thomas Heller.
   The explosion of the colorless, odorless gas did not result in a
fire or further chemical leaks, he said.
   ``One portion of the building was totally demolished where the
equipment went through part of the roof,'' said Boettcher. He added
that unseasonable temperatures in the high 90s didn't appear to
have contributed to the explosion.
   ``Heat is developed in their manufacturing process so I don't
think climatic heat had anything to do with it.''
   Boettcher said the company made airplane propellers and nose
caps and nose cones for rockets and aircraft.
   About 580 customers were briefly without electricity after the
blast, said Pat Messigian, a Southern California Edison
spokeswoman. Power was restored in 25 minutes, she said.
   The names of the victims were being withheld until relatives
could be notified. The injured people were taken to hospitals.

<HEAD>Petition To Reagan Urges Ban On Fetal Tissue Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 500 physicians and others, in a letter
sent to President Reagan on Monday, called for an executive order
banning the use of intentionally aborted fetal tissue for research.
   The plea came 10 days before a National Institutes of Health
special advisory committee meets to finalize its recommendations on
the controversial subject.
   Although its actions at a three-day meeting last month were
informal, the discussions and a series of ``straw'' votes left no
doubt _ even among opponents _ that a majority of the 21-member
panel will formally recommend going ahead with such research.
   However, the advisory committee will not officially forward its
recommendations to a standing NIH ethics committee until Nov. 15 _
a week after the presidential election _ and it is unlikely any
recommendations will make their way up through the federal health
bureauracy until after a new president takes office.
   At least some officials in the White House are pushing for an
early order from Reagan, regardless of what the NIH panel
recommends.
   A week before the advisory committee's first meeting last month,
copies of a proposed executive order accompanied by a memo from
White House domestic adviser Gary Bauer were obtained by reporters.
   In his memo, Bauer told Health and Human Services Secretary Otis
R. Bowen he wanted his comments on the Friday before the fetal
tissue panel began its deliberations the following Wednesday.
   Bowen said he had no intention of making a recommendation before
the matter was fully studied, including by the advisory committee
appointed by NIH Director James Wyngaarden on orders of Dr. Robert
E. Windom, the No. 2 official in Bowen's department.
   Referring to the proposed White House draft that became public
last month, the letter sent to Reagan on Monday said:
   ``The proposed executive order is, we believe, superbly crafted
in its moral perspective with its clear recognition of the inherent
dignity of the human fetus.
   ``We are convinced that it responsibly addresses the looming
abuses of a crass pragmatism which would reduce the human fetus to
a research object for the convenience of other human beings and
medical experimentation.''
   Among those lending their names to the letter: novelist and
physician Walker Percy, author Nat Hentoff and former education
secretary William E. Bennett.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The military commander of
Cap-Haitien, Haiti's second-largest city, has prohibited street
demonstrations until further notice, the independent radio station
Haiti-Inter reported Monday.
   Col. Carrel Occil, military commander of the northern coastal
town, issued the order on Saturday in response to plans for
upcoming demonstrations, the radio said.
   Neighboorhood citizens' committees had been planning
demonstrations against unpopular government officials and in
support of the Sept. 17 coup that initiated a nationwide movement
of reform, it said.
   Since the ouster of the military government of Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy by rank-and-file soldiers of the Presidential Guard on Sept.
17, dozens of commanders with ties to the Duvalier regime were
removed throughout Haiti and unpopular and repressive army officers
and government officials dismissed.
   An unidentified member of a Cap-Haitien neighborhood committee
told Haiti-Inter that ``nothing has changed,'' that anti-democratic
officials are still holding office.
   In recent declarations, such prominent political leaders as
Louis Dejoie Jr. and Sylvio Claude have been calling on the
government to make a clean sweep of members of the dreaded Tonton
Macoutes from public office.
   In a related development, club-swinging soldiers broke up a
demonstration Sunday against the rural police in Petite Riviere, a
town in the Artibonite Province 40 miles north of Port-au-Prince,
Haiti-Inter reported.
   The soldiers, from the garrison of Gonaives to the north of the
town, arrested two protesters and dispersed the crowd by shooting
into the air. None of the people who were clubbed was seriously
injured, Haiti-Inter reported.
   Last week in the same town, 2,000 people demonstrated without
incident.
   In recent days, however, the army has intervened to quell
rallies.
   Last Wednesday, soldiers shot and killed a protester in a
demonstration of squatters in the capital, and two weekends ago, in
Cote-de-Fer, a small southern coastal town, a popular tribunal
composed of citizens and local soldiers was disbanded without
incident by the army.
   Dictator Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier ruled Haiti since 1957
and was succeeded by his son, Jean-Claude, who fled into exile in
February 1986 in the midst of a popular uprising.
   Namphy led a three-man junta that governed this Caribbean island
nation until Leslie Manigat was elected president last January in
elections widely viewed as fraudulent.
   Namphy ousted Manigat and declared himself president on June 20.

   Fire swept through the top two floors of an
apartment building Monday, killing three people and injuring five
others, an official said.
   Witnesses told firefighters that lights in the building
flickered just minutes before the fire broke out, prompting
speculation an electrical problem or an overloaded circuit caused
the fire, said Fire Department spokesman Frank Szwedo.
   ``We won't know for sure until the investigators have gone over
the place,'' he said. ``But these buildings are pretty old.''
   Rescue efforts were hampered by burglar bars over the windows
and apartment doors, he said.
   The Cook County medical examiner's office said three adults were
killed but did not release further information.
   One woman suffered severe burns over her face and body and was
being treated at a hospital, officials said.
   Leon Collins, father of two children injured in the fire, and
Billy Hibbler, both about 20, were being treated for smoke
inhalation. Collins also was treated for burns along the face and
neck.
   Two children were hospitalized for burns and were listed in fair
and stable conditions.

<HEAD>Paperworkers End Strikes At International Paper Mills In Three
States</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GLENN ADAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JAY, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the paperworkers union told
grim-faced members Monday they were abruptly ending a bitter
16-month-old strike against International Paper Co. mills by 2,300
workers in three states.
   The union said the move will give strikers first crack at any
jobs vacated by non-union employees who now run the mills in Jay;
De Pere, Wis.; and Lock Haven, Pa.
   ``This stage of the war is over. We have lost this battle but
the war for justice in the work place is not over,'' said Felix
Jacques, executive vice president of United Paperworkers
International Union Local 14 in Jay.
   Local union presidents from the three mills reached their
decision Sunday after a weekend of private meetings at union
headquarters in Nashville, Tenn., union officials said. The company
was informed by telegram Sunday.
   The workers, including 1,200 at the Jay plant, went on strike
June 16, 1987, when the union rejected a concessionary contract.
The company imposed the contract and kept the plants open with
replacement workers.
   About 720 union members went on strike at the Pennsylvania
plant, and 350 were on strike in Wisconsin.
   A mill spokesman at the Jay plant said the union members, by
calling off the strike, gained the right to be given first
preference for any openings. But he said the mill was ``at full
complement'' and hires new employees at an average rate of only
three per week.
   ``As openings occur, we will welcome workers who have been on
strike who qualify for those openings,'' said Richard White,
stressing that none of the replacement workers would be asked to
leave.
   During the strike, this central Maine town of 4,000 has been the
scene of boisterous rallies and marches, as well as occasional
violence and vandalism that led to court orders limiting activities
on the picket line. A series of chemical leaks and on-the-job
accidents at the mill heightened tensions in recent months, with
the union blaming the problems on the inexperience of the new
workers.
   The union's decision to end the strike does not affect the
company's Mobile, Ala., mill, where more than 1,000 union members
have been locked out. The union had sought to consolidate the labor
disputes at the four mills, but with little success.
   International Paper, one of the largest paper companies in the
world, has said that the strike has had little effect on production.
   Jacques said the union's national leadership had left the local
presidents no choice. He said it was clear the national union could
not provide the support needed to continue the strike much longer.
Strikers had been receiving $55 a week in strike benefits.
   Some of the strikers in Jay, many of whom earned more than
$35,000 a year at the plant, took other jobs during the prolonged
strike.
   Jacques announced the end of the strike to reporters and about
80 somber union members at the union hall, where a sign out front
read ``Stand Tall. We Will All Go Back Together.''
   Although the union has taken no position on whether members
should return to the mill, he said, ``We will stand here in total
support of anyone who ... goes into that mill.''
   Said striker Roland Samson, ``It's not that we don't want to
fight _ it's just that we can't. We have nothing to fight with.''
   Maine Gov. John R. McKernan, whose vetoes of legislation
supported by organized labor made him a lightning rod for the
strikers' anger, called the Jay situation ``a tragedy.'' He
reiterated his view that the strikers were pawns in a fight between
an international company and an international union.
   ``I believe this would have been resolved'' if the dispute had
remained at the local level, McKernan said. ``We just weren't
calling our (own) shots, either at the management level or the
union level.''
   An election to decertify the paperworkers union as the
bargaining agent for mill employees has already been held in De
Pere, and the results are under challenges by both the union and
management. Similar elections are anticipated at the other two
mills. The strikers automatically lose the right to vote in such
elections after one year on the picket line.

<TEXT>
   A page the size of a door from a 550-year-old
manuscript copy of the Koran, the sacred book of Moslems, sold for
$272,745 Monday at Sotheby's auctioneers.
   The page, measuring 6 feet by 3.7 feet came from a work
commissioned by Prince Baysanghur of the Persian Timurid dynasty to
embellish the tomb in Samarkand of his grandfather Timur, the
mighty Mongol conqueror known in the West as Tamerlane or
Tamburlaine.
   Before the sale, appraisers estimated the page would fetch up to
60,000 pounds ($102,600) in Monday's auction in London of Oriental
manuscripts and miniatures, said a Sotheby's spokeswoman, who spoke
on condition she not be indentified.
   The Middle Eastern buyer of the manuscript page wanted to remain
anonymous, she said.
   Sotheby's said only two other pages of this size from the
manuscript are known, both owned by private collectors.
   The page sold Monday contained a seven-line fragment in Arabic
of two of the Koran's 6,236 verses. It read: ``As for those, their
portion of the book shall reach them until our messengers come to
them causing them to die ...''
   Scholars doubt whether a complete version of the manuscript was
ever completed because the project was so huge, the spokeswoman
said. A complete volume of the manuscript would have been 3,500
pages long.
   Nabil Saidi, Sotheby's expert on Oriental manuscripts, said:
``Nobody knows why it is so big but it may have been just for the
grandeur, the lavishness of it. The prince wanted to impress.''
   Sotheby's said the paper pages had not been bound into a book

   The completed pages were looted two centuries ago when war lord

<HEAD>Round-Table Talks Could Last A Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The round-table talks between communist
authorities and the opposition could last three to four weeks and
should focus on basic issues of political and economic reform, a
Politburo member said Monday.
   In an interview with the state-run news agency PAP, Jozef Czyrek
said the talks would be held in the ``latter half of this month,''
but gave no date. Last week, opposition mediator Andrzej
Stelmachowski said they were tentatively set for Oct. 17.
   Czyrek said the talks should aim for an agreement on a
pro-reform coalition that would help work out and implement reforms
agreed upon at the round-table.
   Czyrek did not mention the banned labor movement Solidarity by
name, but said agreement on a model for trade union activity in
Poland would be an important aspect of the talks.
   ``Another key task would consist in arriving at joint
conclusions on accelerating economic reform and, consequently,
working out a Polish economic model as well as reaching agreement
on the matter of the trade union model in Poland,'' PAP quoted him
as saying.
   Solidarity leaders met over the weekend and agreed that
legalizing the movement was essential if the talks were to succeed,
a Solidarity communique said.
   The statement was issued by Solidarity national spokesman Janusz
Onyszkiewicz and was released Monday.
   It also said more than 100 people were fired from their jobs
after the August strikes and that ``stopping all the repressions is
a necessary condition to create the atmosphere of good will during
the coming talks.''
   Authorities agreed to talks with the opposition during a 19-day
wave of strikes in August, Poland's worst labor strife in seven
years.
   Onyszkiewicz also said Monday that a statement he made at a U.S.
congressional hearing last month concerning human rights in Poland
should be published in the Polish press.
   He was responding to a statement by a Foreign Ministry spokesman
on Sunday that his appearance before Congress had done ``some
harm'' to Poland abroad.
   Last week the government said a prosecutor would look at the
statement to see if Polish law was violated.
   Onyszkiewicz said the Helsinki commission of Congress invited
him to talk about human rights in Poland and he told the group when
he appeared Sept. 23 that Polish authorities did not respect rights
guaranteed by international conventions.
   He said in a prepared statement Monday that he demanded
publication of the full text of his testimony before Congress ``in
the mass media, as well as questions and answers. Polish society
will be able then to judge the groundlessness of accusations and
only then it will appear who serves whom.''

<DATELINE>MOUNT WASHINGTON, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three lightly dressed hikers
turned up safe Monday after 24 hours in snow, fog and wind on Mount
Washington, where the wind-chill at the summit was 17 below zero in
the morning.
   Fish and game officials and volunteers had organized search
parties for the three, who had no rain gear or warm clothes, after
a fourth companion had turned back and reported the situation to
officials.
   ``It was really, really cold. We are very lucky,'' said one of
the hikers, Andy Stewart, 23, of Syosset, N.Y.
   The hikers had ignored advice from a shelter caretaker on the
6,288-foot mountain Sunday evening and continued toward the summit,
said Peter Crane, a member of the staff at a mountaintop weather
observatory.
   Mount Washington is notorious for severe and quickly changing
weather. Snow has fallen on the summit in every month, and the
highest surface wind speed ever recorded _ 231 mph _ was registered
at the observatory in 1934.
   Stewart said the three were caught in a sudden storm.
   ``It was fine, then, two minutes later, there were 60 mph winds
and heavy snow,'' he said. ``The snow was up to my chin all the way
down.''
   Stewart said they stayed warm by building a fire _ even burning
dollar bills to keep it going. They resumed their hike down the
mountain about 8 a.m.
   ``We burned whatever we could, bank cards, money, phone
numbers,'' said another hiker, Steve Sardella, 20, of Marlboro,
Mass.
   The third hiker was Matt Dube, 21, of Bethany, Conn. All were
students at Northeastern University.
   The hikers said they had on three layers of clothing and carried
extra sweaters. They also said they carried sandwiches, crackers
and nuts as well as apples.
   Maj. Henry Mock of the state Fish and Game Department said the
three reached Crawford Notch, a pass on the western side of the
mountain, around 2 p.m. Monday in good condition.
   Searchers Monday reported snow drifts up to 4 feet deep, Torrey
said. A road to the summit had been closed for three days because
of snowdrifts. Weather observer John Howe said the summit had a low
Sunday of 14 degrees. Winds gusted to 70 mph Sunday.
   Records compiled the U.S. Forest Service and others indicate
that 103 people have died on Mount Washington since 1849. The most
recent apparently were two climbers killed in separate incidents in
March 1983. Both lost their footing and slid to their deaths down
icy slopes.

   Two young brothers were killed in a house
fire Monday, their bodies found ``cuddled in a corner,''
firefighters said.
   A 1-year-old boy was seriously injured.
   The brothers, Gregory, 4, and Peter Acevedo, 3, were found in a
bedroom adjacent to the kitchen where the fire apparently started,
said deputy fire chief Ernest Miller.
   Daniel Amador, the 1-year-old, was found on the floor of another
bedroom suffering from smoke inhalation. He was listed in ``guarded
condition'' at Strong Memorial Hospital, a spokesman said.
   Firefighters said the boys' stepfather was home when the fire
started.
   The family moved to the United States from Puerto Rico about two
years, a family member said.
   The fire was under investigation.

   The U.S. deputy defense secretary said Monday that
Soviet war capabilities remain a threat to European security and
that defense officials of allied countries are aware of it.
   The U.S. official, William H. Taft, met with Italy's defense
undersecretary, Giuseppe Pasanu, to discuss allied relations and
sharing the cost of the West's defense among NATO countries. Taft
is completing a tour of European NATO allies.
   Taft told reporters later that although all the officials he's
met on this trip agree that NATO efforts should be continued,
public opinion in some of these countries does not agree.
   ``They see the (U.S.-Soviet missile) reductions, which I believe
are the result of keeping a strong defense, and want to use them as
an excuse to decrease defense spending,'' he said.
   When asked about U.S. financial support of NATO, Taft replied,
``We believe that the U.S. should continue to support (NATO)
expenses, and even increase its financial support. The continuation
of the Soviet military threat calls for it and we can afford it.''
   Taft praised Italy as having a good record in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   ``Our friends in Italy have developed a defense program that
will increase the capabilities of the European armed forces and
make a more effective contribution to NATO,'' he said.

aimed at outlawing tax-financed abortions for the poor.
   The referendum in Michigan, one of three states with

budgeted by both sides.
   Abortion foes here have passed out Lifesavers candies in hopes

   A poll has found that the ``Chivas Regal
Syndrome,'' the belief that high tuition means superior education,
is widespread among young people, but that nearly half said tuition
costs block many from college.
   A survey of student attitudes marking National Higher Education
Week, Oct. 9-15, found that 38 percent agreed that ``the higher the
tuition costs of a college, the better the quality of education a
student will receive.''
   Among pre-college-age students, the figures were higher: 53
percent of 13-15 year-olds felt that way; 41 percent of 16 and
17-year-olds surveyed agreed. But among current college students
and recent graduates, 27 percent agreed.
   College officials have lately dubbed that belief the ``Chivas
Regal Syndrome,'' after the premium Scotch whisky, as an
explanation for why Ivy League and other expensive colleges
continue to attract so many applicants. Students and parents seem
ready to pay almost any price for what they believe is a quality
education.

   Vice President George Bush has turned prison
inmate Willie Horton Jr. into a celebrity of sorts in his effort to
exploit Americans' fear of crime as a campaign weapon against
Democratic rival Michael Dukakis.
   Horton, now behind bars in Maryland, is the convicted murderer
who escaped while on a weekend furlough granted by the
Massachusetts prison system, brutally slashed a man and twice raped
his fiancee in 1987.
   Republicans see the incident, along with the police endorsements
that Bush has garnered, as an irresistible opportunity to portray
the Massachusetts governor as a liberal who is soft on crime and
outside the mainstream of traditional American values.
   Bush recites Horton's story in grisly detail in his campaign
speeches, and blames Dukakis as the executive in charge of the
Massachusetts prison system.

   The decision was reached Sunday after a series of meetings with

Tenn.
   The company was informed by telegram Sunday, he said.
   International Paper had continued to run its mills with

   Aldo went to jail. Maurizio became a
fugitive. Paolo claimed his relatives beat him.
   The Guccis, creators of some of fashion's best-known status
symbols, have known constant trouble as a result of family feuds.
   Now, there are signs that peace is returning to the luxury goods
company. But as a result of the turmoil, the company held tightly
by generations of male Guccis now is half-owned by Arabs, run by a
team of MBAs and headed by a woman.
   The woman is Marina Martellini, a 48-year-old former professor
of economics at Milan's Bocconi school, one of Italy's leading
business institutions.
   ``Of the Guccis, only ashes remain,'' laments Giorgio Gucci, the
firm's honorary president.
   Gucci was one of the pioneers of the international Italian
fashion boom, combining centuries-old Florentine artisanship with
modern snob appeal.
   That recipe won it a following among such stylesetters as
actress Audrey Hepburn, Princess Grace of Monaco and Jacqueline
Onassis.
   Money has been no object to customers who have snapped up
everything from a $11 bar of soap to a $50,000 hand-sewn alligator
trunk.
   ``The people in the market want Gucci,'' notes Enrico Cucchiani,
the company's managing director. ``Unfortunately, there's this
Gucci `Dynasty' side to the story.''
   The company was founded in 1922 by Guccio Gucci, a leather goods
salesman who emphasized Florentine quality and tight family control
of the business.
   It was with some reluctance that he watched his son Aldo expand
overseas _ a drive that has resulted in 180 stores and about 82
percent of the parent company's sales today.
   Aldo nonetheless maintained many of his father's principles,
bringing his sons Giorgio, Paolo and Roberto and his nephew
Maurizio into the executive ranks.
   The well-heeled Gucci image suffered its first jolt when Paolo
proposed more inexpensive products and licensing and his relatives
opposed the plans.
   The disagreement exploded into an argument at a 1982 board
meeting and, according to a suit filed by Paolo, his relatives
smashed a tape recorder over his head.
   They denied the charge and the case was eventually dismissed.
   In a subsequent lawsuit by Paolo, charging that his family had
blocked his efforts to trade under his own name, produced documents
alleging that his father, 81-year-old Aldo, evaded taxes in the
United States. The suit was dismissed, but the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service picked up on the documents and in January 1986,
Aldo pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges in a federal court in
New York City. He was sentenced to a year in prison but was allowed
to serve part of his sentence at a halfway house in West Palm
Beach, Fla.
   Gucci relatives were aghast at the war threatening to tear apart
the family and the firm it had built.
   ``The company was a part of my life,'' says Giorgio, Paolo's
older brother. ``I had always smelled the perfume of leather, had
always watched my grandfather in the shop in Florence, working with
so much energy.''
   In 1984, Maurizio used his 50 percent of the company to seize
control and oust Aldo. The young, bespectacled Maurizio brought in
a new team of managers.
   ``The board decided the company had to be professionally
managed,'' explains Cucchiani, one of the young, American-educated
executives.
   But older family members saw it differently.
   ``Maurizio wanted to overcome the idea of a family firm,'' says
his cousin Giorgio.
   Peace did not reign for long. Maurizio's relatives alleged that
the papers giving him half the company on his father's death in
1983 had forged signatures. Maurizio's shares were frozen.
   Based on his relatives charges, courts in Florence and Milan
charged Maurizio with exporting capital and evading taxes. An
arrest warrant was issued and Maurizio took refuge in Switzerland.
   To replace him, state-appointed custodians of his shares
appointed a Milan business professor, Maria Martellini.
   ``A new era has begun,'' Martellini says. ``The company has a
place in the market that is more important than the specific
problems of the Gucci family.''
   Under its new management, the company has launched a program to
expand production, standardize the quality of its stores and trim
its product line, which had expanded beyond leather goods to
100,000 items.
   Sales increased by nearly 4 percent, from 229.7 billion lire in
1986 to 238 billion lire in 1987 _ about $170 million at current
exchange rates.
   Guccio Gucci's linked initials still adorn the firm's handbags,
luggage and scarves. And in workshops in Florence, apron-clad
artisans cut black and cobalt-blue alligator skins and guide
handbags through sewing machines.
   But the Guccis are nearly gone from Gucci.
   Last spring, Giorgio and his brothers Roberto and Paulo decided
to sell most of their shares in the company. The purchaser was
Investcorp, an Arab investment bank.
   While a judge ruled in July that 40-year-old Maurizio could
return to Italy, his shares are frozen. If he loses his court
cases, he may have to sell some.
   Giorgio says he parted with his shares because the new
management was not interested in his ideas and the traditional
standards.
   The new managers, however, insist the company will continue to
reflect the vision of Guccio Gucci.
   ``There is a tremendous strength that goes beyond the fights and
feuds,'' says Cucchiani. ``The strength is the consumer who wants
this brand. The strength is also with the people who work with the
company that want the Gucci splendor, and the artisans that want
that splendor.
   ``The name has got a magic connotation.''

<HEAD>Britain's Laborites Seek to Win Power without Looking Thatcherite</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BLACKPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The quandary facing Britain's Labor
Party emerged starkly at its recent annual convention here: how to
broaden its appeal without seeming to clutch at Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's coattails.
   Splits were apparent across the spectrum. At one end was Bryan
Gould, the polished, college-educated Labor campaign manager,
pleading for more openness to market forces; at the other was
miners' leader Arthur Scargill ridiculing Labor's leadership as
yuppies and capitalists.
   Speaker after speaker rose to level roughly the same accusation:
that by diluting its left-wing doctrines, the Labor Party was
simply trying to copy Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives.
   ``I didn't join the party to have a yuppified approach, to run
capitalism better than the Tories,'' grumbled Scargill during the
week-long conference in early October.
   But Labor has lost three elections in a row to Mrs. Thatcher
since 1979 and has lurched further left in opposition. So when
party leader Neil Kinnock spoke of the need for realism, he meant
recognizing the irrevocable change wrought by nearly 10 years of
Mrs. Thatcher's rigorous brand of conservatism.
   ``The kind of economy we are faced with is a market economy .. .
and we have got to run it better than the Tories,'' Kinnock told
delegates in this north England resort. ``There is no concession to
Thatcherism as great as letting it win again.''
   On the economy, Kinnock succeeded in edging the party to the
right with broad endorsement for the first stage of a two-year
reform package.
   But to his dismay, the big blue-collar unions used their
overwhelming voting power to narrowly reaffirm the party's most
proven vote-loser: unilateral nuclear disarmament.
   It is a decision Kinnock signaled he may ignore when the
conference votes next year on the final version of a new platform
to try to win again in a changed nation.
   The fact is that in Britain, stockholders have trebled in number
to 9 million since 1979, roughly equal to the number of labor union
members.
   The Trades Union Congress, the national labor federation, is
down from 12.2 million members in 1979 to 9.1 million this summer.
   Smokestack industries, such as that state-owned British Steel
which now is being readied for privatization, have shed thousands
of workers in Thatcher-ordered shakeups.
   The manufacturing industry now employs 5 million people, 2
million fewer than in 1979. Service industries, often
non-unionized, employ 1.5 million, up 200,000.
   The economy is growing at 4 percent a year, faster than most
other industrialized countries, fueled by credit-card buying that
has sent the trade deficit heading toward $20 billion this year,
four times higher than originally estimated.
   But opinion polls indicate that most Britons still feel better
off and doubt the Labor Party can preserve their prosperity.
   Two-thirds of Britons own their homes, up from 50 percent when
Mrs. Thatcher came to power and enabled tenants, mostly
blue-collar, to buy state-subsidized houses. The Laborites
initially opposed the policy but now espouse it.
   Kinnock wants to ready Labor for the next general election,
probably in 1991, but the conference left question marks over how
far the party will let him go.
   The unions' block votes helped Kinnock crush a left-wing bid to
unseat him and adopt the first-stage policy reforms. These include
jettisoning commitments to renationalize all state-owned industries
sold by Mrs. Thatcher and to repeal all her union-curbing laws.
   But the resentments, conflicts and class overtones burst through
when Ron Todd, leader of the powerful 1.25 million-member Transport
and General Workers' Union, turned against the leadership, calling
it ``all sharp suits and cordless telephones, clipboards and
scientific samples.''
   Todd, a working-class Cockney, further embarrassed Kinnock by
using his union's block vote to kill an attempt to water down the
pledge of unilateral nuclear disarmament.
   It illustrated Labor's main problem. The party is funded by the
unions that founded it in 1900. But the very power the union bosses
exercise _ 90 percent of the conference voting strength _ portrays
Labor as a prisoner of trade union militancy.
   Todd, 61, characterizes an old and shrinking working-class
constituency.
   Kinnock, a Welsh miner's son, is a university graduate and, at
46, a generation away from his working-class origins.
   Gavin Laird, moderate leader of the engineers' union, saw the
Kinnock-Todd battle as hastening the day when Labor governments
finally disengage from the unions.
   ``Come the day when we have the next Labor government, there
will be no tea and cookies at Downing Street any more,'' he said.
``We will have a healthy, arms-length relationship.''

   When Marisa Fernandez de Sanda went to a
doctor in 1981 to complain about terrible itching and aches all
over her body, she was told these were ``normal signs of spring.''
   But as spring turned to summer and her condition grew worse, the
25-year-old mother of a small son and a baby began to think about
the five-quart plastic jug of bargain ``olive oil'' she bought on
the advice of a neighbor and the news she was seeing on television
about people dying from something called ``atypical pneumonia.''
   Eventually more than 700 people would be dead and 25,000 others
would become mysteriously ill.
   Marisa Fernandez was one who became ill.
   ``I had always bought sunflower oil, but after my second
pregnancy, the doctor recommended olive oil,'' she said in a recent
interview in her home in the Province of Madrid. ``So when my
neighbor said she knew a man who was selling it real cheap, I
thought, here's a bargain.''
   Her friend Clara Burgues de Dominguez bought three jugs of the
oil at a street market because her husband was unemployed ``and
every peseta counts when you're trying to make ends meet.''
   In July 1981 both Marisa Fernandez and Clara Burgues were
admitted to the hospital and told they were suffering from what had
gone from ``atypical pneumonia'' to a mysterious ``toxic syndrome''
that developed from the oil the two women thought was olive oil but
in fact allegedly was rapeseed oil processed for industrial use,
not for human consumption.
   The state brought 38 defendants to trial on charges of
involvement in the import, refining and sale of the oil.
   Fifteen months of hearings ended in June but the verdict of the
three-judge tribunal is not expected for six months, possibly a
year.
   The state claims the oil was the cause of the deaths and the
illness that affects the respiratory system, nerves, joints and
muscles.
   ``I used the oil for everything _ making stews, frying meat and
potatoes, salads, making mayonnaise,'' Marisa Fernandez said. ``I
loved to dip bread in it when I was cooking and eat it on the
spot.''
   Her husband, Juan, and son, David, fell ill briefly but were not
hospitalized. The baby did not become ill but was without his
mother for the first six months of his life, something Juan Sanda
thinks was equally as serious.
   ``The first time I was hospitalized for 25 days, my weight had
fallen from 56 to 43 kilos (123 to 94 pounds),'' Marisa Fernandez
said. ``I was in a room with about 25 other women, and they pumped
us full of pills and shots. Every day someone would leave, and we
would know they had died.''
   Said Clara Burgues: ``When the pain got too bad, we would grab
on to lamp posts when we were walking in the street.
   ``When we went to the hospital, they treated us like guinea
pigs. They didn't know what to do with us, how to treat us, what to
treat us for. They didn't have enough beds so they processed us
through real quick. Then we just had to be readmitted again when it
became unbearable.''
   Marisa Fernandez returned to the hospital in September 1981,
unable to use her hands or feet or to feed herself.
   ``I had no appetite, and all around me, people, particularly
young girls, were dying.''
   At 33, after three years of acupuncture and continuing twice
weekly physical therapy sessions with other toxic syndrome
sufferers, she still has frequent cramps and little feeling on the
right side of her body.
   She can no longer type and can't work outside her home and
receives from the government a monthly disability pension the
equivalent of $270.
   ``There is something all those affected seem to feel,'' she
said, looking at a photograph of herself, emaciated, in a bathing
suit following her hospitalization. ``We all carry the disease on
our faces, like a shadow.''
   Although the Spanish press and most of those affected by the
toxic syndrome blame the oil for the illness, Clara Burgues is not
so sure.
   ``When I testified at the trial, they asked me to say whether I
believed the oil was the cause of my problems. I told them how did
they expect me, a housewife from a lower-middle class neighborhood,
to answer that question. I told them of 28 people among my
neighbors who all used the oil, I was the only one who got sick.
But then they all ate tomatoes, too.''
   That was a reference to the claim of some defense attorneys that
the illness was due to organophosphate pesticides used on tomatoes
grown in southeastern Spain around Almeria.
   Dr. Richard Doll, chief pathologist for Britain's Imperial
Cancer Research Fund, testified at the trial that the oil was the
cause of the illness. Researchers from the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta and the European branch office of the World
Health Organization agreed with Doll's finding.
   Both Marisa Fernandez and Clara Burgues say they are not sure
they will ever get out from under the shadow of the mysterious
illness.
   ``When it first struck, we were treated like lepers by neighbors
and sometimes even family. They were afraid they would catch it,''
Marisa Fernandez said. The illness, once thought to be caused by a
virus, is not contagious.
   Added Clara Burgues: ``But even now that we appeared to have
recovered, we always have doubts _ whenever we get something, an
ache, a problem, we wonder, could it be something caused by the
illness. We are living the syndrome of the toxic syndrome.''

<HEAD>After Heart Surgery, Papandreou's Political Future In Doubt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KERIN HOPE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou came through
open-heart surgery in London, but politicians here at home are
already discussing what they call the post-Papandreou era.
   The 69-year-old Socialist leader had a heart valve replaced and
triple bypass surgery in a seven-hour operation Sept. 30.
   But the health problems, together with his plans to divorce his
American wife and marry a 34-year-old Greek airline stewardess,
suggest to some politicians that Papandreou is likely to put his
private life ahead of politics in future.
   ``The Papandreou government has been a one-man show. With him
unfit it's hard to see how the Socialists are going to carry on,''
said Dimitris Nianias, a member of Parliament from the small
liberal Democratic Renewal Party.
   Leading personalities in Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist
Movement (PASOK) are already cautiously lobbying to stand in for,
or to even succeed, the premier if he steps down.
   Elections are due in eight months, but with a weakened leader,
PASOK may find it hard to repeat the easy victories of 1981 and
1985.
   ``Papandreou will come back from London a hero and the
government will muddle along for the next few months,'' said
political columnist Haris Bousbourelis. ``But after that, will
people really be prepared to vote for a sick man?
   ``PASOK could have an Indian summer, but the feeling around
Athens is that the Socialist era is coming to an end.''
   A U.S. citizen for more than 20 years and an economics professor
at the University of Minnesota and the University of California at
Berkley, Papandreou swept to power in 1981 on an anti-American,
anti-NATO platform, pledging a ``socialist transformation'' of
Greece after a generation of right-wing rule.
   The pledge failed to materialize but the charismatic premier
kept voters' loyalty despite reversing his promises to shut down
U.S. military bases and loosen Greek ties with the West. PASOK won
a second four-year term in the 1985 election with 46 percent of the
vote, down from 48 percent in 1981.
   Papandreou's autocratic style has triggered charges from
opposition conservatives that the Socialists practice
``parliamentary tyranny.'' Left-wingers accuse him of betraying his
radical past and ``backsliding into social democracy.''
   His much-publicized relationship with Dimitra Liani, the airline
stewardess, is likely to have a negative effect on the Socialists'
popularity, according to other politicians.
   The tall, blond Ms. Liani stayed with Papandreou in London,
cooking his favorite Greek food, and posing for photographers in
the hospital corridors. His American wife, Margaret, did not go
there.
   ``There is a broad margin of tolerance about these things in
Greece,'' said Leonidas Kyrkos, who heads the small Greek Left
Party. ``But people already think the Dimitra affair has damaged
the country's image and there will be real trouble if she seems to
be actively involving herself in politics.''
   Socialist officials said that even if his recovery stays on
track, Papandreou will have a sharply reduced workload in the
coming months.
   The officials said the premier will handle only pressing foreign
policy issues like the U.S. bases negotiations and a delicate
10-month-old rapprochement with fellow NATO-member Turkey after
years of rivalry over control of the Aegean Sea.
   The bases negotiations are stalling over Greek insistence that
the high-profile U.S. Air Force base at Athens Airport close down
after the current agreement runs out in December.
   Domestic issues, such as a sagging economy, a 14 percent
inflation rate and huge deficits, along with grass-roots
preparation for next year's election campaign, will be left to
trusted aides, the officials said.
   In keeping with his personalized style of rule, Papandreou
refused to name a stand-in during his absence. Cabinet ministers
have been flying to London for instructions and the conservative
opposition has charged the premier was trying to ``fill a power
vacuum with government by telefax.''
   To avoid the suggestion that he was appointing a successor,
Papandreou asked both deputy premiers, Yiannis Haralambopoulos and
Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas, to supervise day-to-day running of the
government.
   Papandreou hasn't given any hints about who might eventually
succeed him as PASOK leader, but Koutsogiorgas, 69, the premier's
personal lawyer and his closest political confidant, is considered
the strongest contender.
   PASOK's membership includes old-fashioned centrists, ambitious
technocrats and radical left-wingers who are likely to clash if
Papandreou steps down. Papandreou founded the party in 1974 and has
always kept a tight grip on its decision-making.
   There is speculation, too, that Koutsogiorgas might eventually
hand over the Socialist leadership to 36-year-old George
Papandreou, the premier's son, and current education minister,
keeping alive the family political dynasty.
   The premier got his start in politics when his father, centrist
Premier George Papandreou, appointed him to a Cabinet job in 1963.

<HEAD>Eugene O'Neill Centennial Celebrated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Long Island Sound community is
exploding with things O'Neill. It is the focus for celebrations to
commemorate the centennial of the playwright Eugene O'Neill, a
Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winner who summered in New London as a
child and young writer.
   After months of hard work, sculptor Norman Legassie will share
the limelight with O'Neill, who was born 100 years ago on Oct. 16,
1888. Legassie has sculpted a bronze statue based on a famous
photograph of the playwright. The work will be unveiled during
ceremonies in New London on Oct. 16.
   The photograph shows a 7-year-old O'Neill, dressed in his Sunday
best, holding an open book while sitting on a rock overlooking New
London harbor. The photograph was apparently taken near Monte
Cristo Cottage, a home used by the O'Neill family during the
summers of 1889 to 1915.
   The sculpture was assembled at a Rhode Island foundry and will
be placed atop a huge boulder at the foot of the city pier.
   ``It has considerable meaning to it. It's creating its own
meaning,'' Legassie said.
   New London has had a love-hate affair with the playwright for
years.
   To some in New London, there's no doubt that O'Neill should be
celebrated. They note that he's the only American dramatist to have
won the Nobel Prize for literature and four Pulitzer Prizes. Also,
O'Neill did some early writing while in the city, and featured some
of the city's residents in his plays.
   But there also were those in New London who recalled O'Neill as
a hard-drinking young man who ran with the wrong crowd, and while
he based some of the characters in his plays on the city's leading
citizens, the depictions were often unflattering.
   The two visions of O'Neill clashed in 1972, when the city
recognized its local celebrity and named its Main Street in his
honor. Sharp criticism of the playwright surfaced during the debate
over renaming the street. Mayor Thomas J. Griffin stood to oppose
the propsal, calling O'Neill a ``stew bum.''
   The Monte Cristo Cottage is maintained as a museum and listed on
the National Historic Register. A short distance from the cottage,
in Waterford, there is the Eugene O'Neill Theater. Both the theater
and museum have participated in the year-long centennial
celebration.
   The cottage was the setting for ``Ah, Wilderness!'' and ``Long
Day's Journey Into Night.'' ``Moon for the Misbegotten'' was also
set in New London.
   The O'Neills first visited New London in 1883 at the insistence
of a family friend. They liked it, and a year later bought a summer
home here. It was the only true home the family had, since James
O'Neill, the father, was a traveling actor.
   As Eugene grew older, though, some frictions developed. More
wealthy and aristocratic families from New York and Boston had
settled in New London, which became a well-known resort town.
   Eugene cemented his reputation as a ``stew bum'' in 1912. After
his failed first marriage, he went to work for a local newspaper,
covering news and writing poetry. He spent his salary at local bars
and was a well-known womanizer. This led to friction with some of
the town's more upstanding citizens. He made matters worse by
taking considerable pleasure in living up to his rogue reputation.
His newspaper job ended in the fall when he contracted tuberculosis.
   O'Neill told acquaintances that New London ``wasn't a friendly
town'' and that he disliked it. But his actions spoke otherwise. As
he grew famous, he maintained close contacts with New London
friends and inquired about events in the town.
   Yale University, where O'Neill donated his papers, presented
some of his plays last fall, while Connecticut College and Lyman
Allyn Museum in New London also have participated in the marking of
O'Neill's 100th birthday with exhibits of Eugene O'Neill photos and
memorabilia.
   There also will be tours of New London, the O'Neill homes and
Eugene O'Neill Theater, as well as a centennial ball and celebrity
cocktail party with actress Dina Merrill and actor Jason Robards as
honorary chairmen.
   In addition, local residents have helped organize a week-long
celebration that will end Oct. 16 with a parade and unveiling of
the statue.
   The bronze figure will be slightly larger than life: 1.125 times
as large to be exact. Legassie used a 7-year-old boy to model for
the statue and then set out to bring three dimensions to the old
black-and-white photograph.
   It has been a considerable challenge, since this is the first
major work the 37-year-old artist has done on his own. He
previously worked with Adlai Hardin, sculpting three life-size
figures of St. Paul, St. Peter and St. Jude at St. Patrick's
Cathedral in New York City.
   ``The project seemed very interesting to me in that it was
Eugene O'Neill, and I'm familiar with him and his works. Since it's
a local project, I felt even more drawn to it,'' said Legassie, who
lives in Old Lyme.
   The bulk of Legassie's work was making the statue itself, but
two other major obstacles were finding a boulder similar to the one
in the photograph and locating a site for the statue.
   Legassie was unable to locate the rock shown in the photograph
and failed to find a good replacement in New London. A friend,
knowing of his problem, invited him to look in her back yard in Old
Lyme near the Connecticut River. There he found just what he was
looking for: a 5-ton boulder ``with a lot of character'' that was
hauled to New London.
   The rock has been placed near the city pier, a site where many
people will be able to see the statue.
   ``The long-range benefit of this is New London with the arts
community,'' said Michael Lamparelli, director of the Marine
Commerce and Development Committee. ``Eugene O'Neill was one of the
lost sons for a long time.''

<HEAD>Attracting Investment to Northern Ireland No Easy Task</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a 16.9-percent
unemployment rate, Britain's highest by far, Northern Ireland
desperately needs jobs as an antidote to its conflict, and it goes
to extraordinary lengths to attract outside investment to create
them.
   But as the province marks its 20th anniversary of political and
sectarian violence, obstacles persist.
   These include a disinvestment movement in the United States, the
potential ``hassle factor'' of new employment laws designed to
combat job discrimination against the Roman Catholic minority, and
Northern Ireland's violent image.
   To compensate, local businessmen have used sheer persistence and
the government has resorted to enticements, such as rent-free
factories and hefty matching funds, to attract foreign
manufacturers, and they have achieved a small measure of success.
   ``It is very, very difficult,'' said Bob Nicholson, manager of
Du Pont's chemical plant near Londonderry.
   Entrepreneur Jim Bloomer recalls his difficulties in getting
Neotech Industries, a maker of electronic pressure gauges based in
Dallas, to set up a joint manufacturing venture.
   ``I made 21 journeys to the States,'' Bloomer said. ``They were
most definitely not interested in Northern Ireland at that time.''
   Perseverance succeeded for this Antrim businessman, who said
with obvious pride about Northern Ireland's newest American
investment: ``We have people here who have never worked before.''
   Michael Bohill, an executive director of the government's
Industrial Development Board in Belfast, said: ``Our aim is to
create long-term employment opportunities in Northern Ireland. That
is a social as well as an economic challenge.''
   A slump in manufacturing industries has left 117,000 jobless in
Northern Ireland. The Catholic male unemployment rate is 2{ times
higher than the Protestant rate, and the job scarcity fosters an
atmosphere in which Catholic and Protestant armed groups flourish.
   ``One side's gain is quite definitely another side's loss. This
is a difficulty we all face,'' said a government official who
requested anonymity, saying his life recently was threatened.
   Not everybody is convinced that jobs are the answer.
   In fact Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed
Irish Republican Army, believes the creation of more Catholic jobs
will prompt more violence.
   Sinn Fein spokesman Jackie Donnelly said that while he welcomes
more jobs for Catholics, he believes they anger Protestants who
feel the employment opportunities should go to them. These
Protestants, Donnelly added, retaliate by physically attacking
Catholics.
   The IRA is fighting to oust Britain from Northern Ireland,
officially the province of Ulster, and unite it with the Republic
of Ireland to the south. Critics maintain the real reason for Sinn
Fein's stance is the fear that jobs mean normality, and normality
entrenches British rule.
   Northern Ireland relies heavily on outside investment, which
accounts for 35,000, or one-third, of the province's 105,000
manufacturing jobs.
   Americans are the largest outside investors, with 26 U.S.
companies employing 10,000 workers, or about 10 percent of the
manufacturing work force.
   ``The importance of American investment to Northern Ireland
cannot be overstated,'' said the government official.
   But now, American investors are being frightened off by the
movement in the United States calling for disinvestment to punish
what it sees as bias against Catholics, who represent 40 percent of
the population of 1.6 million.
   Since 1986, 11 U.S. states have enacted legislation inspired by
the late Irish statesman Sean MacBride's fair employment
principles, and the British government has mounted a concerted
lobbying campaign to prevent the trend from spreading.
   The MacBride Principles call for disinvestment measures against
companies in Northern Ireland that fail to operate by a code of
anti-discrimination measures, which include affirmative action and
personal protection for workers.
   More states are considering such legislation, which is being
promoted by Irish-American politicians and pressure groups and
which Sinn Fein supports.
   ``We expect to face challenges in quite a number of states,''
said Simon Johnston of Ulster's Department of Economic Development.
   ``We could have had more American funds and we have not got them
and MacBride is part of the reason,'' said the department's Gerry
Lavery.
   The British government has sought to counter the disinvestment
drive with its own laws against job discrimination, which take
effect next year.
   These will force companies to monitor the religious makeup of
their work forces and demonstrate that they are trying to recruit
among minority groups. Offenders will face fines and denial of
government contracts.
   The MacBride Principles are credited with spurring this action,
which the government says makes the principles redundant. But there
are concerns that these will only magnify the ``hassle factor.''
   ``People say, `To hell with this. We'll go to Holland,''' said
Du Pont's Nicholson.
   Ford, the U.S. automaker, was targeted by an Irish-American
boycott in 1986 over the lack of Catholics in the management of its
Northern Ireland operations. Ford had to mount a full-scale
investigation which resulted in an admission that Catholics were
under-represented, and a promise of corrective action.
   Sinn Fein excepted, all Northern Ireland's parties oppose the
disinvestment campaign, including the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, the largest Catholic party, which argues that since
unemployment breeds violence, nothing should be allowed to hinder
job creation, regardless of who benefits _ Catholic or Protestant.
   The U.S. State Department also has come out against the MacBride
Principles.
   Meanwhile, the Industrial Development Board, which employs 300
people and has 11 offices abroad, is focusing on finding smaller,
private companies and potential investors in Asia, which all are
less vulnerable to pressure, and is pushing joint ventures that
reduce the risk to the outside investor.
   ``The financial incentives we offer are extremely attractive,''
Bohill said.
   The board won't elaborate, but for example, Neotech got its
factory rent-free for three years.
   The cost is high. In its first five years, the board has put up
27 million pounds ($46 million) in aid to create an additional 61
million pounds ($103 million) of investment. And the 2,600 jobs it
has created through promoting new inward investment have hardly
dented unemployment.
   But by offering incentives, and stressing such selling points as
Northern Ireland's well-educated work force, the board helped
create 867 new jobs at 12 new inward investment projects in its
most recent financial year, a large increase over the previous 12
months.
   ``We're very confident that we will better that'' this year,
Bohill said.
   The oldest and probably biggest obstacle to investment remains
the fear of violence, which has killed about 2,700 people and has
escalated in recent months.
   No American company or executive has ever been directly touched
by the conflict, but Sam Lord, an American who heads Du Pont's
British operations, said: ``The perception is like a little Beirut.
Or South Africa. It's very difficult to get around that
perception.''

   Listen. You can come out from under your seat
now. The really gross parts are over.
   Yes, masochists will shed a tear. But the filmic fun of flying
body parts, exploding brains and chainsaw haircuts is fading.
   Today's horror filmmakers, abandoning the point-blank plasma of
recent years, are returning to psychological thrillers, with a
wealth of lively style replacing heaps of dead teen-agers.
   ``Dead Ringers,'' which opened to brisk business at the box
office, steers away from the entrails so prevalent in director
David Cronenberg's previous efforts ``The Fly'' and ``Scanners.''
George Romero, who charmed us with cannibalizing zombies in 1979's
``Dawn of the Dead,'' just delivered ``Monkey Shines,'' a taut
chiller with hardly any viscera.
   While the splatter is gone, the suspense is back _ both ``Dead
Ringers'' and ``Monkey Shines,'' critics agree, are profoundly
frightening.
   ``There's been a lot of good scaring in the last 15-20 years,
and you can't do the same old thing anymore,'' said Wes Craven,
director of the acclaimed original ``Nightmare on Elm Street.''
``The audience was bored. They had seen it. They were ready for
something different.''
   Hack-and-slash movies, championed in the mid-1980s by the
blockbuster ``Friday the 13th'' series and later installments of
the ``Halloween'' sequels, aren't producing the packed houses they
once did. In fact, this summer's grisly shockers ``The Blob'' and
``Phantasm II'' both croaked at the box office.
   ``If your film is all a butcher-block collection of death, I
don't think you're working with as large an audience as you could
be,'' said Pen Densham, director and co-producer of ``The Kiss,'' a
spooky supernatural thriller opening Oct. 21. ``The challenge now
is to take the audience into your imagination.''
   Few have succeeded at that better than Cronenberg. While his
films have always been upsetting, the shock value in ``Dead
Ringers'' is, in a twist, as fancied as it is real. Among the most
disturbing scenes in the movie, a tale of psychotic twin doctors,
is the simple unveiling of a half-dozen malformed gynecological
devices.
   ``The instruments are physical things that I'm using to
represent a state of mind,'' Cronenberg said. ``It's only an
extrapolation from what we used to feel sitting in a dentist's
chair. Suddenly the tray of little instruments is wheeled up. You
know that technically they are to help you. But experientially
they're going to hurt.''
   The challenge for today's fright masters is to snare the
mainstream _ not just those who, for lack of anything better to do,
love being scared to death. Toward that goal, directors are
concentrating on more traditional storytelling, with a greater
emphasis on inventive visuals, tighter, more logical plots and
creative music and sound effects.
   ``The directors who are committed to the genre are maturing,''
said veteran horror specialist John Carpenter, director of
``Halloween'' and ``The Thing'' and the upcoming ``They Live.''
   Horror newcomers, too, are exploring unusual strategies to
induce fear. In ``The Kiss,'' director Densham gives life to a
swimming pool, a wind chime and an escalator. ``My goal is to try
to fuse vision with emotion,'' Densham said. In ``Child's Play,''
coming Nov. 9, director and co-writer Tom Holland has created a
fresh (and sometimes funny) white knuckler about a toy doll with a
really bad attitude.
   ``We've all become much more sophisticated in what we've grown
accustomed to on the screen,'' said Richard Rubinstein, producer of
Stephen King's ``Pet Sematary,'' due out early next year. ``If the
audience cares about the characters, then they will care when they
get into trouble. If you introduce a group of teen-agers who climb
off a bus, nobody cares when they get popped off.''
   Furthermore, the dead teen-ager movies focused on one fear _
fear of attack. When manipulations of that emotion grew too
frequent, the genre lost its original snap. ``When you got down to
that level (with anonymous children dying anonymous deaths), what
you're really doing is pornography,'' Carpenter said. ``You're only
setting the audience up for the meat.''
   Said Craven: ``There are different kinds of terror. One is just
terror of having your body harmed _ something like `Friday the
13th' with Jason coming after you with a machete. ... But there are
other kinds. There is the terror of whether you're sane or not, or
whether your perceptions are accurate or not, or whether your
dreams are real.
   ``Those sorts of things to me are much more interesting, and
much more complex, and have more of a potential for fright.''
Craven's new untitled movie, scheduled for release next year, will
focus on ``premonitions, hallucinations, dreams, religious trances
and possession.''
   Still, there will be some gore.
   ``Unless you have one scene that really scares ... people _ that
really makes them feel that not only is the killer beyond normal
rational actions but the filmmaker is too _ then the audience is
not really frightened,'' Craven said. ``But once you do that, you
don't need to do it over and over again.''
   Entrails enthusiasts, however, need not panic completely. While
there is room for style in Hollywood, there will always be a place
for low-budget slice-and-dice. Coming soon to theaters near you:
``Death Spa,'' ``Slaughterhouse Rock'' and ``Demented Death Farm
Massacre.''

   ``It is the tradition of our politics, and a
very poor tradition, that the vice-presidency is a shelf,'' Henry
Cabot Lodge wrote to Theodore Roosevelt. ``It ought to be, and
there is no reason why it should not be, a stepping stone.''
   Pretty slippery stepping stone.
   Roosevelt did not get to put Lodge's theory to the test. After
being elected vice president in 1900 he was catapulted into the
White House by the assassination of President William McKinley.
   Every vice president who has had the chance to in the last 60
years, however, has tried for the presidency while holding the No.
2 position.
   So far, they have all failed.
   Alben Barkley, Harry Truman's vice president in 1952, could not
even win his party's nomination. He was forced to withdraw in the
face of labor opposition.
   Richard Nixon, as Dwight Eisenhower's vice president in 1960,
captured the Republican presidential nomination easily but lost to
John F. Kennedy, in a campaign in which he got little help from
Eisenhower. He had to wait eight years to win the White House on
his own.
   The candidate he defeated was Hubert H. Humphrey, running while
serving as vice president under Lyndon B. Johnson at the height of
the unpopular Vietnam war.
   Now George Bush is trying it. If he wins on Nov. 8, he will be
the first vice president to succeed to the presidency by election
since Martin Van Buren followed Andrew Jackson into the White House
in 1836.
   Political scientists and professional political strategists say
that although Bush is doing better than most, vice presidents face
formidable problems when they try to become No. 1.
   ``There is the burden of defending an incumbent administration
plus the fact that the job is, in a way, a wimpy job,'' said Leo
Ribuffo, a specialist in political history at George Washington
University.
   ``A vice president, for better or for worse, is defined in large
part by the public's view of the president he serves,'' said Frank
J. Donatelli, President Reagan's chief political aide.
   ``The fact that we have to hear talk about the Reagan-Bush
administration, as we once had to about Eisenhower-Nixon, is
nonsense,'' said Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution who was an aide in the Eisenhower White House. ``It's
not the Reagan-Bush administration; it's the Reagan
administration.''
   Ryan Barrileaux, a professor at Miami University in Oxford,
Ohio, is a member of a new school of political scientists who
regard the vice presidency as an important post. But even he agreed
that ``a lot of vice presidents have the problem that they are
regarded by people as being generally insignificant.''
   ``I think what happens is that they tend to regard him as
nothing more than a senior presidential aide,'' said Barrileaux.
``They don't really think of him as an independent politician or as
someone with a standing in his own right.''
   Scholars say that during much of U.S. history, vice presidents
were not regarded as presidential contenders, except for those like
Theodore Roosevelt or Andrew Johnson who became president when an
incumbent died.
   ``During most of the 19th century, with a couple of exceptions
such as John Calhoun, vice presidents were nonentities,'' said
Ribuffo.
   ``It was other offices that were regarded as breeding grounds
for presidents,'' said Barrileaux. ``For much of American history
the secretary of state was regarded as a sort of potential
president.''
   For more than a century after Van Buren, no vice president ran
for president, according to ``Presidential Also-Rans and Running
Mates, 1788-1899,'' compiled by Leslie H. Southwick.
   The last one who passed up a shot at it, however, was Charles G.
Dawes in 1928. When President Calvin Coolidge announced that he did
not choose to run, Vice President Dawes did not choose to run
either.
   In each of the next four presidential elections, 1932 through
1944, the incumbent was running for re-election, so there was no
realistic chance for the vice president to step in. In 1948, with
Truman filling out Roosevelt's term, there was no vice president.
   Then came Barkley's abortive try in 1952. In 1956, Eisenhower
was on the ticket. In 1964 the vice presidency was again vacant. In
1972, 1976, 1980 and 1984, incumbents were on the ballot for
president _ first Nixon, then Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Reagan.
   Which brings up 1988 and Bush.
   ``This is different, not only to the degree that Reagan is
anxious to do something to help Bush on the stump as a campaign
speaker, but also to the degree that he seems almost to have turned
over major decisions of government to Bush, where Bush cared to
involve himself,'' said Hess.
   As examples, the Brookings scholar cited Reagan's veto of a
defense authorization bill and his decision to allow a trade bill
to become law without his signature instead of vetoing it, even
though it contained a plant-closing amendment that he stoutly
opposed. Both actions were favored by Bush although opposed by some
other Reagan advisers.
   Other examples, said Hess, are Reagan's appointment of Secretary
of the Treasury Nicholas Brady and Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, both Bush allies, and the choice for education
secretary of Lauro F. Cavazos, an Hispanic from politically crucial
Texas.
   ``Also, the country is at peace and feeling prosperous,'' he
said. ``In 1960, we were coming out of a recession. In 1968 there
was a war. We are not talking about so many cases that we can
crunch them through a computer. We are talking about a couple of
cases, and each one is a little different, but this one is very
different.''
   Hess and other scholars agreed that Reagan has given Bush more
work to do as vice president than most previous presidents have,
although he did not make a key adviser of him as Carter did of his
vice president, Walter Mondale.
   Bush was ``not as important as Mondale, but certainly more
important than, say, Lyndon Johnson was in the Kennedy White
House,'' said Barrileaux.
   Although Reagan has often pointed to Bush's accomplishments as
vice president, Barrileaux said, ``I guess many people didn't think
of these things as terribly important.''
   ``When you mention things like the Task Force on Regulatory
Relief, that sounds very enigmatic to many voters, I would
imagine,'' said the Miami University scholar.
   Ribuffo, who is writing a book on Carter, said that Carter
``really did include (Mondale) in policy discussions and used him
extensively as a Capitol Hill lobbyist.''
   ``I don't get the impression that Reagan used Bush nearly so
much or included him so much,'' the political historian said.
   However, he added, ``It doesn't seem to have hurt much so far.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Preservationists remember Penn Station the way
Texans remember the Alamo. Indeed, the demolition of the old
station that began 25 years ago this month marked the rise of the
preservation movement in New York and around the nation.

   It was a monument to the glory of the Roman
Empire and the Pennsylvania Railroad, a great temple of marble and
granite married to a soaring tent of steel and glass. Here was a
building, wrote Thomas Wolfe, ``vast enough to hold the sound of
time.''
   Built to last for centuries, Pennsylvania Station was only 53
years old when jackhammers began pounding its walls on Oct. 28,
1963 _ 25 years ago _ to make way for a drum-shaped sports arena
and a bland, glass-and-steel office building.
   Except for a few protesters who circled disconsolately in a
drizzle, the station passed unmourned.
   The demolition crew foreman said it was just another job. ``If
anybody seriously considered it art, they would have put up some
money to save it,'' his boss added.
   ``This city's got the right name _ New York,'' observed a man
behind the counter of the station restaurant. ``Nothing ever gets
old around here.''
   Over the next two years Penn Station was broken into pieces,
dumped in a New Jersey swamp and replaced by the subterranean
station that bears its name today.
   The only reminder of the landmark that filled two blocks on
Seventh Avenue between 31st and 33rd Streets are two eagles that
once perched on a ledge over the front door, but now squat on the
ground.
   But the old station has monuments wherever people have fought to
save the buildings they love, because the fall of Penn Station
marked the rise of the preservation movement in New York and around
the nation.
   ``Most preservation groups form around a preservation battle,
and often they lose the first one,'' says Sally Oldham of the
National Trust for Historic Preservation. ``The whole story of the
movement is the story of lost buildings.''
   Pennsylvania Station was the greatest loss of all.
   ``Through it one entered the city like a god,'' architectural
historian Vincent Scully has written. ``One scuttles in now like a
rat.''

   At the turn of the century the Pennsylvania Railroad was the
largest company in the greatest industry the world had ever known.
The railroad's president, Alexander Cassatt, wanted a building that
would make a trip into the city an occasion.
   Inspired by the Baths of Carcalla in Rome, architect Charles
Follen McKim designed a station twice as large as the Hamburg
railroad station, then the world's largest, and nearly three times
larger than any American station.
   McKim's vision was set on the edge of Hell's Kitchen, a rough
West Side neighborhood of factories, stockyards, slaughterhouses
and tenements. Five hundred buildings were razed to make way for
the station, and 1,500 people displaced.
   When work began in 1906, people compared the excavation to the
Panama Canal. ``The great hole,'' as it was known, reached 58 feet
into the ground.
   When it was finished in 1910, observers were equally impressed.
On Seventh Avenue, a two-block-long row of Doric columns _ each 35
feet high and 4 feet thick _ rose to meet a low roof.
   Fourteen granite eagles, each 5 feet tall and 5,700 pounds,
roosted on a ledge under the roof. Each of the four main entrances
was topped by a clock with a dial 7 feet in diameter, flanked by
the statues of women symbolizing night and day.
   But the new station's real attractions were inside. The general
waiting room, the size of the nave of St. Peter's, featured
six-story high Corinthian columns and a vaulted ceiling 150 feet
high. Through it passengers moved to the train shed, whose soaring
glass-and-steel roof achieved the same affect as the waiting room,
only on modern terms.
   William Faulkner heard in the rafters ``the voices of all the
travelers who have ever passed through.'' That ranged from
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, heading for his home in Hyde Park,
to the Depression homeless, going nowhere.
   In those days it did not matter that the station was
architecturally unrelated to anything around it, or that its huge
spaces, exhilarating on first sight, became tiresome when crossed
repeatedly. So what if there were no seats in the main waiting
room, or an information booth?
   But the end of World War II was the beginning of hard times for
railroads. By 1951 the Pennsylvania Railroad was running a $72
million annual deficit. Four years later, the railroad quietly
agreed to sell the station's surface space to developers and build
a new, smaller station below street level.
   Meanwhile, the Pennsy's deteriorating finances were reflected in
its station. The train shed's glass roof became grimy with soot,
and broken windows were replaced with metal. The huge topographic
wall maps which depicted the railroad's territory were almost
obliterated. The pink granite had turned a dull city gray.
   The general waiting room was marred by a modern structure that
housed ticket booths, as well as incongruous advertising signs and
displays that critic Lewis Mumford said turned the room into ``a
vast jukebox.''
   Finally, in 1961, the railroad broke the news: Penn Station
would come down to make way for the third Madison Square Garden.
   Critic Ada Louise Huxtable noted that Americans could never
again afford to build a nine-acre structure of superbly detailed
solid travertine, ``any more than we could build one of solid
gold,'' and a few young architects organized in protest and
picketed the station.

<HEAD>NEW YORK: the station.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The outcome was never in doubt. The public had no interest in
saving the dirty, neglected old building, and the city had no
authority.
   But that began to change almost as soon as the station's
destruction began. The next day The New York Times called it ``the
shame of New York'' and concluded: ``We want and deserve tin-can
architecture in a tin-horn culture. And we probably will be judged
not by the monuments we build but by those we have destroyed.''
   In death, the station became more precious than in life. As it
slowly was demolished over the next two years, people had time to
contemplate the twisted steel and broken marble to which the
station had been reduced. The railroad was deluged with requests
for the station's remains, ranging from the eagles to squares from
the floor.
   ``Suddenly the preservation issue was on the front page across
the country, and it created the feeling of `We are not alone' among
local preservation groups,'' says Elliott Willensky, an architect
who protested the station's destruction.
   Penn Station's destruction touched a nerve because it was the
most visible sign of what had been going on across the nation for
the previous 15 years.
   Between 1930 and 1946, depression and war curtailed construction
of new buildings and thus the destruction of old ones. But in the
boom that followed the end of World War II, virtually no historic
building was safe.
   In South Philadelphia, hundreds of late 18th- and early
19th-century buildings were destroyed to make way for an interstate
highway. In Bridgeport, Conn., an 1848 Gothic revival mansion that
had been willed to the city was torn down to make way for a parking
lot. Boston lost its Opera House in 1957, and a group of buildings
designed by Bullfinch on India Warf five years later.
   But Penn Station's loss seemed to mark a turning point. ``Its
death was necessary to make us realize what could be lost,''
journalist Lorraine Diehl later mused.
   Largely in response, New York City created the Landmarks
Preservation Commission. Although a few cities, notably Charleston,
S.C. and New Orleans, already had such agencies, New York's could
designate entire neighborhoods as historic districts.
   Although the commission cannot grant a building absolute
protection _ there are circumstances under which an owner can tear
a landmark down _ the new law made their destruction far more
difficult.
   To date, the commission has landmarked 824 individual
structures, 75 interiors and 9 parks, plus 14,415 buildings in 50
historic districts including the upper East Side, Greenwich Village
and Brooklyn Heights. Flatbush alone has three separate districts.
   Without commission protection, many architectural jewels _
notably the Radio City Music Hall _ almost certainly would have
been destroyed or significantly altered.
   Federal highway and urban renewal funds had been used to destroy
thousands of historic buildings, but in 1966 the National Register
of Historic Places was created to hamper such destruction.
   Before the National Register, the federal government recognized
only about 900 landmarks, and afforded them no protection. Today,
the register has more than 50,000 entries, including whole
neighborhoods like Washington's Georgetown.
   At the local level, where buildings are saved or lost, more than
1,000 communities have preservation zoning ordinances, compared to
fewer than 40 in 1963.
   In the years since Penn Station's demise, many great buildings
have been saved: the Wainwright Building in St. Louis, an early
skyscraper designed by Louis Sullivan; Grand Central Terminal in
New York, whose protection by the Landmarks Commission was upheld
by the Supreme Court; the ornate old Executive Office Building,
next door to the White House, which was saved when Congress refused
to appropriate funds for its demolition.
   Today, preservationists remember Penn Station the way Texans
remember the Alamo. When some of them wanted to protest a proposed
change in the city landmarks law earlier this year, they returned
to the scene of the crime.
   ``The lesson we learned here is that if we fail to be vigilant,
we will lose the things that matter,'' one speaker said.
   The lesson is about all that's left of the old station. For a
time train passengers riding to and from New York through the New
Jersey Meadowlands could see the remains, including the sculpted
female figures of day and night.
   A few pieces were claimed by the Brooklyn Museum and Ringwood
Manor State Park in New Jersey. Some of the eagles were shipped to
the Pennsy's 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, as well as to
stations along the Long Island Rail Road.
   The station's destruction could not save the Pennsylvania
Railroad, which merged with the New York Central in 1968 and filed
for bankruptcy two years later, leaving railroading to the federal
government.
   The ``new'' Penn Station _ which needed a massive renovation
less than 25 years after its completion _ has been dismissed by New
York Times critic Paul Goldberger as a ``depressing maze of
underground corridors pretending to be a train terminal'' and ``one
of the more notable architectural disasters of the 20th century.''
   Irving Felt, chairman of the Madison Square Garden Center Corp.,
had higher hopes in 1963, when he predicter wane when the
so-called new wind starts to blow (or) those who bear
responsibility for having brought the economy and other social
sectors into critical situations and yet call today for new
principles of management,'' Hegenbart told Rude Pravo.

   Politics and taverns used to go together like
horse and carriage. In DeKalb County they still do _ at least at
Manuel's Tavern in the Atlanta area. It's not exactly yuppie chic,
but it's THE place for the movers and shakers of Democratic
politics.

   Manuel Maloof runs his campaign not from
some sterile TV studio but from a smoky old tavern that two
generations of Dixie politicians have come to refer to reverently
as ``The Shrine.''
   Maloff is chief executive officer of booming DeKalb County,
population 534,000 and growing, up for re-election to a second term.
   He is as unlikely a candidate you could find running a major
urban government _ rumpled, gruff, outspoken, emotional, the proud
antithesis of the blow-dried politician of the '80s.
   Such is his popularity that ordinarily this might not be such a
tough race for him, but this year his health could become an issue.
It has not been the easiest of years for Manuel J. Maloof.
   First, he went in the hospital for a bad foot, and wound up
receiving last rites _ twice _ as he nearly died from pneumonia.
Then he had some trouble breathing, and wound up with
quadruple-bypass heart surgery.
   But fighting the odds is nothing new to Maloof, son of a
Lebanese immigrant and perhaps Atlanta's most famous tavern owner.
   Manuel's Tavern, on the now-hip fringe where Atlanta's
commercial east side gives way to DeKalb County and the dignified
Druid Hills neighborhood, is a quintessential tavern. Not a joint
or a nightclub, but a real tavern, where a body can find a properly
cold beer, a burger at reasonable prices, and a place to talk.
Regulars call it ``The Shrine''; The Wall Street Journal once
called it a ``a smoky dive'' _ which the staff promptly put on
T-shirts.
   Manuel's is smoky. The wagon-wheel light fixtures, looking like
they came from a long-closed family steakhouse, don't match. There
are pictures of John and Bobby Kennedy over the bar and beer signs
on the walls and a painting of a nude woman over the booths; a
patron once handed it over as payment for his bar tab.
   Manuel's has big round tables, so friends can gather and talk,
and it's bright enough for patrons to see who they're talking to.
That's important to Maloof, and it's his tavern _ and his years of
holding court there _ that propelled him into politics, where he
landed as chief executive officer of booming DeKalb County,
population 534,000 and growing.
   Maloof, now 64, grew passionately interested in government in
his youth, listening to the politicians and the government workers
in the Tip Top Billiard Parlor, the Atlanta tavern and gme room run
by his father, Gibran Maloof, a 1907 immigrant from Beirut.
Manuel's own tavern, which he opened in 1956, soon became a meeting
place for politicians, journalists and academics, who talked into
the night about the issues of the day.
   ``My father was one of the best Americans that ever lived,''
Maloof says. ``He just believed that we owed this country. While he
never encouraged me to go into government ... he sort of instilled
in me that we owe it, and we ought to pay it back.''
   Maloof at first thought politics wouldn't be open to him because
of his foreign extraction, the fact that he was a Catholic _ ``not
too popular in the county in those days'' _ and because he was in
the bar business.
   By 1972, Maloof had become known as the behind-the-scenes
godfather of Democratic politics in DeKalb County. The tavern was
an unofficial party headquarters, and Maloof supported the party
financially when it was strapped for cash. That year brought a race
for a DeKalb County Commission seat, ``and nobody would run as a
Democrat,'' he recalls.
   ``I was trying to get some people to run, and everybody copped
out. So it came down to the clock running out, and I said, `What
the hell, I'll just do it, just to be a token candidate. We cannot
allow it to go unchallenged.'''
   He lost. But he was pleasantly surprised to land 42 percent of
the vote, and two years later he tried again, winning this time, an
at-large post. He served until 1978, then stepped aside. Maloof
said he couldn't take it anymore.
   But in 1980, he jumped back into politics, beating the incumbent
County Commission chairman. In '84, he won the newly-created post
of chief executive officer.
   Maloof is hardly a polished politician. He sporadically
threatens to quit. He says what he thinks. ``I believe they take my
word if I tell them something; they know I'm not going to lie to
them,'' he says.
   And he plunges into the nuts-and-bolts of government, running
the county the way he runs his business: never spend money unless
you have to, and never pay the asking price.

   This year, Maloof is seeking his second term as CEO, the last
he's allowed by law. And that, he says, will be it. ``I'll be 68
years old. If I even live that long I'll be thankful.''
   Maloof has long fought diabetes, a disease underlying his other
health problems. One leg is larger than the other, leaving him with
a laborious gait. He was soaking a painful foot earlier this year
when he was scalded and complications set in _ infection,
pneumonia, blood clots in both lungs.
   ``They wrote my obit,'' Maloof says with a laugh. ``They've
still got it out there in the office. They wrote me off.''
   He recalls lying in his hospital bed, terribly ill, seeing
``this cliff, in my mind, that I was going to fall off of and die.
It was all covered with all this slimy, green vegetation, vines and
stuff. And I could look down in there and see this hole. I was
going to fall off of there. And all of a sudden, they just pushed
me back.''
   It was, Maloof believes firmly, the prayers of his many friends
which saved his life. ``I'll believe that 'til my dying day,'' he
says.
   Maloof hears that he's mellowed.
   ``No, that's not so,'' he growls. ``I've always said there's the
blessed and the damned: the blessed are those who don't give a
damn, and the damned are those who do. Somehow or another, I was
always the damned, because ... if I think something's not right,
I'm not going to just let it slide.''
   Maloof acknowledges that coming close to death ``gave me a lot
to think about. You get in these jobs and you get to wondering _
everything I do must make somebody mad. But there was a genuine
outpouring of affection in those prayers. ... That was the nicest
surprise.''
   Maloof was a delegate to this summer's Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta, for another son of immigrants, Michael
Dukakis. Maloof is an unabashed old-style Democrat. In a time when
``liberal'' is a political profanity and Ronald Reagan calls
Dukakis ``an invalid,'' Maloof worries what has happened to his
country and its politics.
   ``They throw up these walls, and you're a way-out left-winger
because you care about people,'' he says. ``All of a sudden, it
isn't right to say what you think. And we are losing that ability,
I think. ...
   ``What happened to us? Maybe it's because I've gotten old....''
   These days, Manuel's Tavern only sees Manuel once or twice a
week; he doesn't have the time. His brother, Robert Maloof, and his
children run the original tavern and two branches in the suburbs.
   But there was a time when Maloof ran his bar morning 'til night,
and his friends gathered 'round. Politicians and journalists would
argue politics. Faculty members from nearby Emory University would
hold after-class seminars; a religion professor named Tom Alitzer
was explaining his ``God is dead'' theory at Manuel's long before
the rest of the world heard about it.
   Maloff still prides himself on building a tavern where cussing
too loudly will get you tossed, where a woman can sip a beer
without getting hit on, and where talk and friendship, are the best
entertainment.
   Maloof has firm ideas about he wants people to remember him
years from now, when he'll be running neither their county nor
their bar.
   ``I hope they just say, `He knew what he was doing. He cared. He
really cared.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ American consumption of poultry has increased
dramatically in the past couple of decades, but there are few
stores left where you can pick out your chicken while it's still
clucking. One of them is ``John's Live Poultry and Egg Market'' in
an ethnic neighborhood in Chicago.

   The shop sounds like a barnyard. Roosters crow,
chickens cluck and squawk, pigeons coo and rabbits thump and jostle
in their cages.
   Step inside, back to a time when there were no giant supermarket
chains or frozen-food sections, and mom-and-pop grocery stores kept
crates of live chickens out back.
   At the small store, tucked away in a Polish and Italian
neighborhood, customers who order a fryer, broiler or roaster take
home chicken so fresh it was squawking 15 minutes earlier.
   The butcher, who wields his knife with a surgeon's pride, also
sells fresh rabbit, quail, pigeon, duck, geese and the bantam
roosters favored in some Italian kitchens for stews and sauces.
   ``I've been here for 27 years and the store's been here since
the Second World War,'' says the proprietor, Al Gordon, 51,
although esh turkeys.
   Time has sharpened his skills, though he says he still works up
to 50 hours a week and at least 15 hours a day around Thanksgiving
and Christmas.
   On average, Gordon sells 400 to 500 chickens, 40 to 50 rabbits
and 15 to 20 ducks a week.
   Ninety percent of the poultry is raised by Amish farmers in
Indiana, Gordon says.
   ``They don't use any chemicals. There's no preservatives in
them,'' he says. ``All of your store-bought poultry are dipped in a
preservative to give them a longer shelf-life.''

   Community foundations, for a long time the quiet
arms of philanthropy, are coming of age and providing funds for
more serious projects than ever before. The Hartford Foundation is
a prime example of the change in size and activity.

<TEXT>
   When the Ford Foundation decided to lend
a helping hand to AIDS patients and their families, it found that
even with its billions of dollars, it couldn't handle the project
alone.
   It sought the help of much smaller community foundations,
non-profit organizations that are emerging as key players in
philanthropic work in this country.
   ``In the last five years, community foundations have come of age
and are being recognized for their potential and what they're
doing,'' said R. Malcolm Salter, director of the Hartford
Foundation for Public Giving.
   Since the first community foundation was founded by bankers in
Cleveland in 1914, many of the organizations have been content to
fund such activities as planting flowers or supporting the local
symphony.
   But, increasingly, community foundations are being called on to
tackle more serious issues, such as AIDS, a trend their leaders
attribute in part to the Reagan administration's eight years
promoting volunteerism and reducing federal spending on social
services.
   The result is that community foundations now make up the
smallest, but fastest growing faction of the Council on
Foundations, a Washington, D.C.-based group that represents most of
the nation's foundations.
   There are now about 325 community foundations, and another 20
have been proposed and are in various stages of organization,
according to council officials.
   The combined assets of those groups are estimated at about $4
billion, and they made grants totaling about $300 million last year.
   Ford, meanwhile, has assets of about $5.5 billion, and made
grants totaling $204 million in 1987, said Joanne B. Scanlan, who
directs the council's effort to bolster community foundations.
   ``For a long time, community foundations have been kind of a
quiet type of philanthropy,'' Scanlan said. ``Over time, partly
because assets have built up and partly because community
foundations have started working together and promoting themselves,
a lot more private foundations have started working with them.''
   The Hartford Foundation is recognized as a leader among
community foundations in both its size and activity. Its assets of
roughly $125 million make it the sixth largest in the nation, while
it doles out about $6 million annually to various Hartford-area
projects.
   The wealthiest of the community foundations in the country is in
New York, followed by foundations in Cleveland, Chicago, Boston,
San Francisco and Hartford.
   New York's community foundation has assets of about $500
million, while Cleveland's has about $450 million in assets,
Scanlan said.
   Every foundation is organized under federal tax guidelines as a
non-profit organization.
   Unlike the United Way, which must solicit funds each year to
give money to specific groups, community foundations have
endowments from which they draw earnings to fund their grant
programs.
   The foundations rely on donations from individuals and
corporations to continue expanding their endowments.
   A donor can have a long-term impact, since it is the interest on
a gift and not the donation itself that is spent from year to year,
said Tom Smith, the Council on Foundation's public affairs director.
   ``It's more than a one-time gift, because what a community
foundation does is it pools those funds, and your money can go
farther,'' Smith said.
   Connecticut has 19 community foundations, most of them very
small in comparison to Hartford's, which is the state's largest.
Waterbury established the state's first community foundation in
1923, followed by Hartford in 1925.
   The Hartford Foundation is unlike most other community
foundations in the value of its assets and how it uses its wealth.
   Ninety-one percent of its funds are unrestricted, meaning it can
use those assets to make grants to any project, Salter said. Most
other foundations are limited to spending their money on very
specific projects, he said.
   ``The foundation is particularly blessed to have most of its
funds unrestricted ... which gives the distribution committees now
and in the future the discretion of where the money can best go,''
Salter said.
   For instance, the foundation has a $3.5 million project to
combat poverty in Hartford. It also provides millions of dollars
more in grants to local hospitals, civic organizations, as well as
the symphony, arts groups and colleges.
   The foundation gives up to $75,000 to a first-time recipient,
with the money paid in one year or spread over three years. A
repeat client can receive up to $300,000, paid in one year or
spread over three.
   The Hartford Foundation's recent experience exemplifies what is
happening to community foundations around the country, particularly
in terms of demand.
   Applications to the foundation were up 28 percent this year
compared to last, and the amount of money requested was up 70
percent. In the past eight years, the foundation has given out $34
million compared to just $25 million in its first four decades.
   In response, the foundation changed its rules. It will no longer
accept requests for funds on a first-come-first-served basis. Its
distribution committee will now meet seven times a year to dispense
funds.
   ``I think we'll be much more visible in the future than in the
past because we're becoming more actively involved in initiating
and bringing people together,'' Salter said.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They may be the luckiest kids in Alaska, or all
of the United States for that matter. They have a mountain of
garnet they can mine as they wish, but it's often the parents stuck
with the dirty work. The children are mostly the peddlers and, like
in the modeling profession, theirs is a trade where youth is
all-important.

<DATELINE>WRANGELL, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mayor's gift of a mountainside of
garnets to the children of this remote island town has turned two
generations of its youngsters into industrious gem dealers.
   Paper routes and lawn mowing provide small change compared to
the $1,000 or so a Wrangell child can earn each summer by hawking
garnets to cruise ship passengers and other tourists.
   Crowds of children meet almost every ship at the Wrangell
waterfront, carrying their gems in everything from muffin tins to
Tupperware. Some stand shyly and depend on tourists' curiosity to
draw customers, but most warble, ``Wanna buy a garnet?''
   Tourists pay a quarter for a pea-sized purple gem, $20 or more
for a golf ball-size garnet embedded in a chunk of the silvery
schist from which it was chiseled.
   The garnets come from a mountainside at the mouth of the Stikine
River, on the mainland about nine miles from Wrangell.
   The property was deeded to the Boy Scouts of America in 1962 by
the late Fred Hanford, a former mayor of Wrangell, a town of about
2,100 in southeastern Alaska. Under the terms of the gift, only Boy
Scouts and the children of Wrangell have rights to mine and sell
the garnets.
   In reality, garnet collecting is a back-kinking, knee-scraping,
thumb-smashing chore that falls to the gem sellers' parents.
   ``I don't know what's more work, the kids' homework or selling
garnets,'' says Kay Jabusch, one of the self-described ``garnet
moms'' who accompany their children to the docks.
   About every six weeks, Mrs. Jabusch and her husband, Jeff, pilot
their river skiff through the shifting channels of the Stikine to
reach the garnet ledge and replenish their sons' supplies. They lug
pails, chisels and hammers up the quarter-mile trail that climbs to
the garnet ledge.
   A few stones can be screened from loose soil and rock next to a
nearby stream. But most must be chiseled out of huge faces of rock.
   Power tools and blasting are forbidden. Adults who want to go to
the ledge are asked to buy a $10 permit at the Wrangell Museum and
turn over a portion of their take to the Boy Scouts. The Scouts
also ask people to sign a liability-release form.
   Old Wrangell newspapers say the ledge was mined from 1907 to
1923 by the Alaska Garnet Mining and Manufacturing Co. of
Minneapolis, Minn., a company run by two sisters.
   A geological study done in the 1940s says Wrangell garnets are
superb for industrial uses such as sandpaper, but that few become
jewels. The garnets have quartz inclusions that cause them to
fracture when cut. Most buyers want them as curiosity pieces,
though some say they will try to set the stones.
   ``I'm going to get mine polished for my granddaughter, for her
21st birthday,'' says Rhoda West of Rancho Cucamonga, Calif.
   A North Carolina couple getting off the same ship bought garnets
for their son, a geologist, and a New Mexico woman bought a
garnet-studded rock for her mother's knickknack shelf.
   Selling can be hard work. Children get up before dawn to meet
early ferries and often stand in drenching rain to make their sales.
   Watching her sons work the state ferry dock, Rynda Hayes
explains why it's worthwhile for Raymond, 7, and Ryan, 9.
   ``They want new bikes. They've always had secondhand,
put-together bikes,'' says Hayes, who recalls selling garnets when
she was their age.
   The Jabusch boys bought their own tickets to Hawaii for this
year's family vacation. Garnet moms also say their children don't
ask for allowances and get better grades in math class after a
summer of making change.
   Many young garnet sellers have opened their own savings
accounts, though in their minds, the ``saving for college'' angle
is mostly a sales gimmick.
   ``Most people say they're doing it for college, then they go buy
a bike,'' says 11-year-old Mike Jabusch, confiding his sales
secrets. Adds friend Toby Dow: ``If it's for college, more people
buy.''
   Toby, also 11, likes to tell people they can buy one garnet and
get another free. Ten-year-old Bob Roppel has another sales tip:
``Try to look sad.''
   The boys talk business over cups of hot cocoa at a dockside
restaurant. One proposes lowering prices to boost everyone's sales,
launching an earnest debate over whether the discount should be 50
cents or a quarter.
   Earnings are secret. The only boy who will say what he makes is
the undisputed sales champ: 7-year-old Jake Jabusch.
   In less than an hour on the dock, Jake collected $33.20. He
quickly added it up and figured his three-day take _ $98.
   With a mop of blond hair and an urchin grin, Jake doesn't have
to do much to make a sale. Tourists, many of them grandparents,
flock to tousle his hair, hug him and buy his garnets.
   But Mrs. Jabusch says Jake's glory days are numbered. Like other
Wrangell youth, he'll find sales dwindling as he gets older. ``They
get taller, and the tourists like the younger kids,'' she says.
   Most children abandon their garnet trays, she says, the day they
look around and realize they're the oldest kids on the dock.

   Bernadette Peters, starring in her first
dramatic TV movie, plays the role of the mother in ABC's ``David,''
which is based on the true story of a 6-year-old boy horribly
burned by his father during a custody dispute.
   It's the story of David Rothenberg, who suffered severe
disfiguring facial burns and is still undergoing therapy at age 12.
The father is currently in prison and comes up for parole late next
year.
   In the movie, which ABC will televise next Tuesday, Peters plays
David's mother, Marie Rothenberg, John Glover portrays the father,
Charles Rothenberg, and Matthew Lawrence plays young David.
   During the filming of one of the earlier scenes, Peters is in
the kitchen furiously fixing spaghetti sauce and arguing with her
ex-husband over his demand to see more of their son.
   Director John Erman calls for another run-through. Peters,
dressed in a brown suit, pauses at the kitchen door with a bag of
groceries in one hand. She wears a lacy white blouse and pearl
earrings, with her brown hair pinned up. At the call of ``action,''
she enters, throws canned goods into the cabinets and starts making
the sauce.
   ``It's Wednesday, the first day,'' Peters explains after
completing the scene. ``The father takes David for the weekend on
Friday. She doesn't find out what happens to David until the
following Thursday. She has another confrontation with Charles on
the telephone. She's beside herself. She wants him to bring David
back.''
   Before starting work on the movie, Peters met with Marie
Rothenberg, who has since remarried, and David.
   ``I asked her what she felt,'' Peters says. ``She said she
thought at first David was going to die. There was only a
thousand-to-one chance he would live. She said if he was going to
live, two minutes, two days or two years, she wanted him to feel
love.
   ``A little boy goes on vacation with his father and wakes up in
a hospital. He can't speak, he can't see. His lungs were badly
burned, so he talks now with a rasp. All she could do was zero in
on the child. All her emotions focused on the child.''
   Peters says David doesn't remember much about the incident.
   Although ``David'' is the first dramatic television movie for
Peters, she began working as a child in New York City, first in a
local children's show. She was on ``Kraft Theater'' at 9 and did a
``Hallmark Hall of Fame'' at 11.
   ``The first big thing I did was `Dames at Sea,''' she says. ``I
was like 19 at the time. I was on Carol Burnett's show a lot. I did
`The Tonight Show' and the `Merv Griffin Show.'''
   Peters starred in numerous Broadway productions, winning a Tony
for her performance as Emma in ``Song & Dance'' in 1985-86. Her
movies include ``The Longest Yard,'' ``W.C. Fields & Me,'' ``Silent
Movie,'' ``The Jerk,'' ``Pennies From Heaven'' and ``Annie.''
   Her latest movie is ``Slaves of New York,'' based on Tama
Janowitz's stories. She plays Eleanor, a designer who is part of
the art world Janowitz writes about.
   Her only series was ``All's Fair'' in 1976-77, which also
starred Richard Crenna.
   ``I think doing a series is very hard,'' she says. ``I haven't
wanted to do one again. I prefer to play all kinds of roles. I
don't want to play the same character for five years. It's more
interesting and more fun to do all kinds of things.''
   She had hoped to take some time off after ``David,'' since she
went into that direct from Stephen Sondheim's musical, ``Into the
Woods.'' But she is currently in Nevada co-starring with Clint
Eastwood in ``Pink Cadillac.''

   The masters are gone, but today the Rodgers and
Hammerstein office is more than just a clearing house for the great
shows of Broadway's most successful musical partnership.
   From what was once Richard Rodgers' Madison Avenue office,
theatrical properties are licensed, protected, polished and even
rediscovered for an empire built upon such smash hits as
``Oklahoma!,'' ``Carousel,'' ``South Pacific,'' ``The King and I''
and ``The Sound of Music.''
   From high school drama society to a big producer in London's
West End, if you want to do a Rodgers and Hammerstein show, you
start there at the office. When the Beef & Boards Dinner Theater in
Indianapolis, for example, decided to do ``The Sound of Music'' in
September, its first task was to contact the R&H office.
   What the dinner theater eventually received, according to its
artistic director-producer Douglas Stark, was a stack of ``Sound of
Music'' scripts and orchestrations which the theater adapted for
its own five-piece orchestra. Royalties were based on a percentage
of box-office gross for the 400-seat theater which has a top price
of $27.95 for dinner and a show on Saturday night.
   That's ``a standard package of material'' says Theodore S.
Chapin, the ebullient 37-year-old executive director of the Rodgers
and Hammerstein office, and son of Schuyler Chapin, once general
manager of the Metropolitan Opera.
   The history of the R&H office dates to 1943, somewhere between
the time ``Oklahoma!'' went into rehearsal and when it opened on
Broadway, when Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II realized what
valuable commodities they had created.
   The two men had worked for years with other collaborators _
Rodgers with Lorenz Hart and Hammerstein with Jerome Kern, Sigmund
Romberg and Rudolf Friml, among others.
   ``Their goal was to keep as much in-house as they could,''
Chapin says. ``They got to the point where they were writing,
producing, managing and publishing their own music through the
Williamson Music Co. Both had fathers named William.''
   Among the successful non-Rodgers and Hammerstein shows they
produced were Irving Berlin's ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' ``I Remember
Mama,'' ``John Loves Mary'' and ``The Happy Time.''
   ``What we know today as the stock and amateur market never did
musicals,'' Chapin says. ``High schools did straight plays like
`Charley's Aunt.' It wasn't until the rise of summer tent theater
in the 1950s that the whole secondary market for these musicals
opened up.''
   ``Oklahoma!'' has always been the most popular Rodgers and
Hammerstein musical with strong competition from ``South Pacific''
and ``The Sound of Music.''
   ``One of the amazing things about the Rodgers and Hammerstein
canon is that there are five big shows,'' Chapin says. ``And five
big shows are enough to go in cycles so that when one of them is
dormant, another comes back strong.''
   The rented scripts used for most of the big shows are the London
scripts, Chapin says. One of the things his staff is trying to do
is go through them and change the dialogue to more American
English, taking out the Anglicized words. ``Oklahoma!'' has already
been done and ``South Pacific'' is being worked on now.
   Chapin also got the original scores from the Library of Congress
and had the orchestrations recopied, so copies sent to theaters
could be more authentic.
   ``You would think that there would be absolutely letter-perfect
scripts and orchestrations,'' Chapin says. ``But there weren't.
These two men were savers, but in the backroom and the trunk. They
would change things to make them work on stage.''
   The company's rental library also handles shows by other
authors. It rents most of the Rodgers and Hart musicals, like ``The
Boys from Syracuse,'' ``Babes in Arms'' and ``Pal Joey.'' It also
has Kurt Weill's ``The Threepenny Opera'' and the recent musical
hit ``Big River'' in its catalog.
   When he has a chance, Chapin keeps an eye on different
productions Rodgers and Hammerstein license. In one recent week he
was in Dallas to catch a ``Sound of Music'' with Debby Boone and
then in Chicago to take in ``Pal Joey'' starring Kevin Anderson and
Carlin Glynn.
   One of the strangest productions he has seen was a
show-within-a-show version at New York University. The director set
the musical in a rehabilitation ward, where the recovering veterans
put on ``South Pacific.''
   ``It was a little peculiar,'' he says. ``What we did in that
instance was let them run the contract out. They wanted to extend
the run, but we said no to that.''
   Chapin has not permitted anyone to videotape their productions
because it violates the various shows' movie contracts.
   ``I am very aware of the fact that the authors are not alive,''
Chapin says. ``We are basically in a caretaking position. Their
families have some very strong ideas on how to keep their fathers'
and their husbands' work alive and what changes will or will not be
allowed.''
   Chapin has his own ideas for Rodgers and Hammerstein revivals.
One is a television production of ``Pipe Dream,'' an unsuccessful
musical written for Wagnerian opera singer Helen Traubel. Chapin's
version would star the Muppets.
   ``The musical is based on John Steinbeck's `Sweet Thursday,'
which has a great collection of people who are just hanging around
a skid row,'' Chapin says. He envisions Miss Piggy playing the
Helen Traubel role.
   Chapin is also gearing up for the 50th anniverary of
``Oklahoma!'' in 1993, which should prompt an avalanche of
productions and interest in song-writing team.
   ``America has not forgotten who Rodgers and Hammerstein are,''
Chapin says. ``Hammerstein died in 1960 and Rodgers in 1979, but
their music is still around. `The Sound of Music' is played on
television every year. It has been on the video sales charts for
more than 150 weeks, the last time I looked.''
   And they still get live productions.
   ``These shows are classics,'' says Stark, whose production of
``The Sound of Music'' is running in Indianapolis through Nov. 6.
``People love them and keep coming back. Six years ago, we did `The
Sound of Music' and it's selling better now that it did the last
time.''

   The government does not publish figures on gold production, but
the Soviet Union is recognized as a world leader. Shilo, who still
works in the prestigious Academy of Sciences in Moscow, estimates
that perhaps 20 percent of the nation's gold comes from the Far
East.
   One exploration chief in the area, Vladimir Zinchenko, said the
government buys gold from the mines for 18 rubles a gram (a third
of an ounce). On paper that works out to $29 at the official
exchange rate of the ruble and adds up to more than twice the world
market price of about $400 an ounce. But such figures have little
meaning because the ruble is not a convertible currency on world
markets, and its black market value is only a fraction of the
official rate.
   But gold itself can buy the goods now unavailable to Soviets in
poorly supplied state-owned stores.
   Zinchenko said the black market price for gold is about 78
rubles ($125) a gram, more than four times the official price.
   Fifty years ago Magadan was little more than a pass-through
point for the gold fields and labor camps of the Kolyma River basin.
   A couple of stone houses and rows of wooden barracks resting on
the hills overlooking the harbor were all that greeted prisoners
who had endured weeks on crowded, filthy eastbound trains to
Vladivostok. From there they were loaded on ferries for the
1,350-mile trip north to Magadan, and then sent inland from there.
   Shilo passed through Magadan on his way north in 1938, as did
Asir Sandler, who was a prisoner.
   Sandler, who said he was accused of spying, was on his way as a
forced laborer in the gold mines where, he recently recalled,
prisoners could expect to be overworked, underfed and dead within a
year.
   Sandler survived, however, and lives today in Magadan as a
writer.
   Mayor Gennady Dorofeyev of Magadan said the last of the old
prison barracks were torn down in 1987.
   Magadan residents, Dorofeyev added, had discussed turning some
of them into monuments to the horror of Stalin's repression but
decided ``it's better that we build homes and kindergartens instead
of such gloomy places.''
   Officials insist that economic development and the heavy
migration to the Far East makes it look to the future instead of
the past.
   Klyuchnikov, the Academy of Sciences researcher, said
development of the Far East must emphasize joint projects by small
and mid-sized enterprises with Japan, China and other Pacific
countries.
   Officials in Magadan said they are eager to work out agreements
with Pacific neighbors, including the United States. One joint
fish-processing agreement already has been set.
   Vyacheslav Kobets, government leader of Magadan province, who
headed a delegation that visited Alaska in September, said the
Soviets think there are much greater opportunities for joint
Soviet-American cooperation in fishing, oil exploration and tourism.
   ``We have taken only the first step in our common
relationship,'' he said.

   Alexander Kirakasyants flies in an old
airplane over frozen seas and tundra. Yuri Moskvin and Boris
Savekin work deep down in the frozen earth.
   Along with thousands of others with roots in more accommodating
places like Leningrad or Moscow, these three men are stalwarts
drawn to the Soviet Far East by the promise of adventure, premium
pay and perhaps a future.
   Pilot Kiraksyants flies research missions over Arctic ice floes
and tundra.
   Polar bears and a harsh, unforgiving climate are facts of life
on the extreme edges of the extreme land where the 28-year-old
Kirakasyants and five other crew members work.
   Flying eight to nine hours a day in their propellor-driven,
35-year-old Ilyushin 14, they chart passages through dense ice
packs for the Soviet Arctic fleet to tiny outposts like Pevek on
the East Siberian Sea, check water temperatures and observe the
movement of whales and walruses.
   And although Kiraksyants is proud of his work and is accustomed
to many of the difficulties of life in the Far East, he sometimes
questions whether it's worth the struggle.
   Like most others who live in the isolated territory,
Kirakasyants was born elsewhere. His father's decision a generation
ago to take a mechanic's job in Pevek led the family from
Leningrad, the Soviet Union's second-largest city, to a settlement
only a handful of Soviets will ever see.
   Thousands of Soviets have made a similar decision, heading north
and east for adventure or pay that averages three to four times
more than workers in the European part of the country.
   ``I went with my father to the airport many times, and he showed
me the planes,'' Kirakasyants said, taking a break during a recent
flight to Lavrentiya on the Bering Strait. ``It determined my
future. I always dreamed of being a pilot.''
   Like many residents here in the Arctic Circle, Kirakasyants
brushes off the effects of temperatures that reach 67 degrees below
zero. The cold is bearable, he said, because the air is dry.
   But life in Pevek is hardly stimulating, he said. Touring groups
from the big cities to the west provide what little cultural
activities are available.
   Food is flown in or brought by ships when ice conditions permit.
   In September, harvest time in the southern Soviet Union, stores
here had grapes, watermelons, plums and other fresh foods. But at
other times of the year such perishables are unavailable and the
supply of staples, other than canned goods, is uncertain.
   Kirakasyants hopes to move someday, but not necessarily back to
a European city. Perhaps, he said, he'd go to Magadan, the
provincial capital of 160,000 people to the southeast on the Sea of
Ohkotsk, and fly passenger jets for Aeroflot, the Soviet airline.
   ``Life is getting better for us here,'' he said, ``but not as
fast as I would like.''
   Yuri Moskvin, 37, and Boris Savekin, 38, the men of the earth,
live south of Pevek in Palatka, a gold-mining area just inland from
Magadan where Kirakasyants would like to go.
   They, too, are thinking of where they might want to go once they
have reaped their rewards from the Soviet Far East and retire.
   Moskvin, a gold-mine shift leader, already knows he's going
someplace warmer and less remote; Savekin, a mechanic in the same
mine, isn't so sure.
   Savekin came to the mine near Palatka 14 years ago and now earns
a salary of 800 rubles ($1,200) a month, four times more than the
nationwide average for an industrial worker. Like others with jobs
underground, he works a six-hour shift, gets 54 days of vacation a
year and will be eligible to retire at age 50.
   Palatka, where Savekin and Moskvin live, is a town of
broken-down wooden buildings and dreary housing blocks.
   Moskvin, a 12-year veteran of the mine, told visiting reporters
that his mother was one of the first Komsomol, or Young Communist
League, workers sent to open up the Far East, so his ties to the
area are long.
   But he said he already has decided to retire somewhere in the
European part of the country.
   Savekin, who hasn't made any definite plans for his future, said
he is satisfied here with the two-room apartment he shares with his
wife and two children, ages 10 and 16.

<HEAD>The Artists: Where Life Is Simple; Where Artists Work Well</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETSY HENDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PETERBOROUGH, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A few months ago, Linda Clark
struggled in Brooklyn to write the opening pages of her first
novel, ``Familiar Voices.''
   Two or three nights a week, after commuting home from a job
writing technical manuals in Manhattan, she would scribble ideas in
a spiral notebook or capture a passage or two on her IBM Selectric
typewriter.
   She'd tell friends she had a class, but still the phone would
ring periodically, or she'd get hungry or a growing laundry pile
would cast a dim shadow over her prose.
   Her novel's gestation period lengthening with each passing day,
Clark mailed off an application to use an isolated artist's studio
at New Hampshire's MacDowell Colony. She was one of more than 220
writers, painters, composers, sculptors and photographers granted
temporary use of 31 secluded wilderness studios this year.
   The day-to-day routine at the 450-acre colony is not real life,
nor does it try to be. Founded in 1907 by the widow of composer
Edward MacDowell, it's a place, says President David Heleniak,
``where life is simple, where artists work well.''
   That simplicity includes a private one-room cabin in the woods,
a basket lunch catered to fussy diets and delivered daily and the
guarantee of distraction-free seclusion from breakfast to dinner.
   Total price: whatever the artist can pay toward the $90-a-day
cost.
   Apparently the formula works. In 81 years, 43 Pulitzer Prize and
41 Prix De Rome winners have found tinder for their creative fires
in the woods of MacDowell, the nation's oldest _ and some say most
prestigious _ artists' colony.
   It's not for everybody. Some artists can't stand the isolation
and, in fact, need diversions to work. But for the right person at
the right time, a stay at MacDowell can be manna from heaven.
   Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist Thornton Wilder said the colony
gave him kindness when he needed it and ``a place to hear myself
think.'' Composer Aaron Copeland said it carried out its goals
``magnificently'' and ``has provided a unique contribution to
American cultural life.'' Composer-conductor Leonard Bernstein said
MacDowell inspired works of ``vastness ... dealing with subjects of
astronomical, if not mystical and astrological dimensions.''
   ``You have a perfect day and then you realize you're going to
have another,'' the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Barbara
Tuchman said.
   For the 28-year-old Clark, privacy and support of her fellow
artists provided the atmosphere for her to produce almost a third
of her book in the first four weeks.
   ``I even took a day off and finished a story,'' she said. ``I've
never been able to write a story this fast.''
   The scene of this epic productivity was Watson Studio, a 1915
gray stucco bungalow graced with six grand white pillars mimicking
a Southern plantation house. One of the colony's only live-in
studios, this miniature Tara lies nuzzled in the woods at the end
of a dirt road marked with the threatening sign: ``No vehicles or
viewers beyond this point.''
   Other artists sleep in homey dormitory rooms and trek each
morning _ down roads marked with similar warnings _ to their
studios.
   Clark's typewriter sits on a chunky Victorian table in the
20-by-30 foot room, which is decorated in a style described by a
former resident as ``impoverished nobility.'' Other furnishings
include a grand piano, an antique bed, a gilt chandelier and a
threadbare couch.
   Enhancing this obvious long history are 10 wooden plaques _
``tombstones'' _ hanging on the walls beside Watson Studio's red
brick fireplace. They contain the many signatures of the studio's
famous and not-so-famous previous occupants dating back to the
1920s. Author James Baldwin signed his name in the '60s;
Bernstein's appears several times in the '60s and '70s.
   For some, the idyllic conditions, the isolation or the legacy of
success create stifling fears.
   ``I don't think I would be constitutionally able to head off
into the woods after breakfast and hear nothing until dinner except
the thump of the lunch basket on the front porch,'' author William
Styron said in August before receiving the 1988 MacDowell Medal for
his life's work. ``In fact, I think my sanity might be at risk.''
   Some colonists have been known to turn over the tombstones in
their studios to escape the scrutiny of hundreds of absent artists.
   ``The first time I was here, when I was younger, I freaked out
the first three weeks,'' said Debra Weisberg, 35, a sculptor from
Somerville, Mass. ``It was just paralyzing. It's perfection, and
you feel like if you don't do the best work you ever did, then
you're not using this well.''
   Ten years after her initial visit, Weisberg says she's matured
as an artist and is comfortable working at Mixter, a slate-roofed
stone cottage whose latticed windows look out on a dark pine
forest. This time she's concentrating on translating the energy of
her sculptures into two dimensions. Her earth-tone drawings
inspired by decaying forms in nature cover several rolling display
panels in the '30s studio.
   Weisberg said she's learned to trust her instincts about when to
work and when to take a walk or write a letter or just think:
``You're not a factory. You're not a machine. You have to take care
of yourself physically and mentally and spiritually to keep making
artwork.''
   Making the decision to set aside five or six weeks for work also
seems to help artists get into the right mental state to write,
paint, compose or edit.
   Author Martha Weinman Lear credits the ``formalization of
commitment.''
   ``A writer does not come here to have writer's block,'' she
wrote. ``Not to deny or be disrespectful of the muse ... is simply
isn't done.
   ``In this New England climate, not parsimonious, but spare,
commendably frugal, a writer's block, which in New York is
something to dine out on and bemoan in a boastful way, like New
York itself, would be a frivolous shame and a waste.''
   In 1928, Virginia Woolf wrote the essay ``A Room of One's Own''
about the conditions artists _ specifically women artists _ need to
create works of genius. Her conclusion was that, in addition to
education and a sense of tradition and history, an artist needs a
private room in which to work and an independent income.
   ``Imaginative work ... is not dropped like a pebble upon the
ground,'' she said. ``Fiction is like a spider's web, attached ever
so lightly perhaps, but still attached to life at all four corners.
...
   ``But when the web is pulled askew, hooked up at the edge, torn
in the middle, one remembers that these webs are not spun in midair
by incorporeal creatures, but are the work of human beings and are
attached to grossly material things, like health and money and the
houses we live in.''
   MacDowell temporarily provides a room and the illusion of
independent wealth. And when an artist's stay ends, perhaps he or
she has the momentum to move beyond life's mundane chores.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Sex Goes With Rock 'n' Roll</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GLENS FALLS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sex, says Lita Ford, goes with rock 'n'
roll like tires on a cab.
   The compact blonde offers no apologies for the skimpy outfits
and pouty looks she displays on the cover of her third album,
``Lita,'' which produced the hit single, ``Kiss Me Deadly.''
   ``It's advertisement,'' Ford said during a recent dressing room
interview at the Glens Falls Civic Center. ``Besides, you make
money off selling merchandise. I mean, how do you sell a pack of
cigarettes without advertising?''
   Ford, a brash 29-year-old rocker who's posed for publicity
photos wearing nothing more than her guitar, may or may not have
benefited from her particular form of advertising, but she's
leaving little in her career to chance.
   She's taken lessons from vocal coaches and called on well-known
producer and writer Mike Chapman to add his pop sheen to her songs.
Chapman, who produced much of Blondie's best work, helped Ford
write some of her material and convinced his friend, Mick Smiley,
to give her the song ``Kiss Me Deadly.''
   The love, or lust, song with a chiming melody and metallic
crunch made it all the way to No. 12 on the Billboard Top 40 chart,
and the video earned Ford a nomination for best video of the year
by a female artist. Suzanne Vega's ``Luka'' beat her for the trophy.
   ``Our main goal on this album was to go gold and we're almost
platinum so we definitely accomplished what we were looking to
accomplish,'' said Ford, whose first record for RCA has already
sold about 800,000 copies. ``It's not over yet.''
   Ford angrily eschews the label ``heavy metal,'' but she's
co-written songs on ``Lita'' with two of that genre's major stars:
Ozzy Osbourne and Nikki Sixx of Motley Crue.
   And she's parlayed her success with the album into opening act
slots on tours led by metal popsters Poison and Bon Jovi, assuring
her of captive audiences of rabid teen-agers for the next few
months to come.
   Her songs run the gamut of easily-identifiable teen-age
emotions, with such titles as ``Broken Dreams,'' ``Back to the
Cave'' and ``Fatal Passion.''
   The blunt ``Can't Catch Me'' advises a potential boyfriend to
stay away from strong-arm tactics. ``You'd better think twice, I
ain't no Sandra Dee,'' Ford sings. ``Don't think I'm easy, I wasn't
born blonde.''
   Ford, who's pictured on the back cover of her record hoisting a
belt of silver bullets, said she considers herself a role model for
girls who want to enter the world of rock 'n' roll. She advises
them to toughen up.
   ``If that's what they really want to do, just go with it. ...
Don't let any idiots steer you the wrong way,'' she said.
   Her own career started young, at age 16, with the all-female Los
Angeles band the Runaways.
   The Runaways, who played punk rock, were never big sellers and
they took their share of critical lumps before breaking up in the
late 1970s over fights about future direction. But they boast two
successful alumni in Ford and Joan Jett, currently riding high
herself with the hit, ``I Hate Myself for Loving You.''
   ``We were all poor, but we all loved what we were doing,'' Ford
said of her days with the Runaways. ``It was my way of going
through life.''
   She said she keeps rocking because ``it's what I do best,''
though it's not always the easiest career. As she watched a road
crew member drag a cooler of beer and soda across the dressing room
floor, she mused that she'll spend her day off horseback-riding.
   ``Every business has its ups and downs, whether you're a taxi
driver or a rock 'n' roller,'' she said. ``It gets lonely on the
road sometimes. The guys can pal around with the guys, but it gets
real hard for me to just go out and pal around with the guys,
because I'm not one of the guys.''
   Although she appreciates the power and excitement of the music,
Ford also recognizes it's a job _ leading to a slightly cynical
view of what she's doing.
   ``It's a product, it's something that you sell,'' she said.
``Music, cigarettes, an amp, a carpet _ what's the difference? It's
all a material thing that you sell.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Meet Fred Exley the Author</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAZENOVIA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Praise from critics and adoration from
college students does not pay the rent for novelist Fred Exley.
   He drives a 1974 Oldsmobile he bought several months ago for
$600, lives in an apartment over a garage in upstate New York, eats
boiled potatoes and chicken noodle soup and has a will, but no
money.
   But the 58-year-old author, who's first book, ``A Fan's Notes,''
is considered an American classic, is not looking for people to
have some kind of corny, romantic vision of him.
   He's not looking for compassion because he already has composure.
   ``I don't have any sympathy for myself in the sense that this is
the life I chose for myself. Nobody chose it for me,'' Exley said
in an interview at a friend's house. ``I'm not without my inner
peace.''
   He says, without a doubt in his gruff, monotone voice, that if
he had wanted, he could have been a handsomely paid vice president
of public relations somewhere, waiting to collect a big pension and
driving a new, expensive car. Instead, he chose to ``roll the
dice'' and write literature that has been described as sadly funny,
bone-chillingly honest, overpowering and passionate.
   His new book, ``Last Notes From Home'' (Random House, $18.95),
is his third novel and the conclusion of an autobiographical
triology that readers had to wait two decades for him to finish.
   When Exley's first novel was published in 1968, he received rave
reviews, won several awards and seemed on his way to becoming one
of this country's great authors. Seven years later, his second
book, ``Pages From a Cold Island,'' came out to mixed reviews.
Neither book sold very well and the excitement disappeared.
   He didn't exactly reinvigorate the enthusiasm by taking 13 years
to write ``Last Notes,'' a period when he struggled with trying to
figure out how to insert recurring themes into the new novel and to
convince his publisher that he could complete the book.
   Now that it's finished, Exley is hoping for a big comeback.
However, he certainly isn't going out of his way to encourage the
success of the book: no TV talk shows; no barrage of interviews in
New York City.
   In fact, as his book starting showing up in book stores across
the country in September, Exley was ``hiding out'' at the home of a
former college roommate just outside Syracuse, N.Y., from his
apartment on Wellesley Island, located about 30 miles from his
hometown of Watertown, N.Y.
   It's not that Exley is shy or reclusive or that he doesn't want
to be bothered. Exley just isn't comfortable dealing with the
scores of people he considers either phony or pretentious, or both.
   When college students stumble into the Thousand Islands Club
after driving all night from Columbus, Ohio, to see ``Exley, our
god,'' the author joins his friends in the finger pointing game of,
``I'm not Exley, he's Exley.''
   When he goes to his favorite bar in Manhattan, the famous
literary haunt, The Lion's Head, and he overhears two customers
doing the celebrity-watcher refrain, ``That's Fred Exley. Where?
Over there, see?,'' he gets up and walks out.
   ``Last Notes'' has brought Exley even more fame.
   With such colorful characters as James O'Twoomey, an excessive
and outrageous Irishman who takes Exley hostage in Hawaii, and
Robin Glenn, a stewardess and pathological liar who marries Exley,
the novel is funny, downright hilarious at times.
   The author believes the book contains some of the funniest and
most powerful writing he's ever done, and that it probably has the
most commercial appeal of his three novels.
   As he talks, his words are preceded and followed by various
profanities, used as tools of humor, not anger. His doleful and
penetrating brown eyes usually look away.
   His books tell the story of Fred Exley, the alcoholic son of a
Watertown sports legend who travels from mental hospitals to
taverns to living room couches to Hawaii, seeking fame and
self-awareness.
   While many of the events in the books _ from the electric shock
therapy to two divorces to trying to shoot his teen-age twin sister
with an antique rifle _ are based on reality, Exley said he's never
written a word about himself.
   ``Autobiography is impossible. It never occurred to me to do
that,'' he said. ``When I started out, I said, `Why do it that
way?' I thought this would be different.''
   It doesn't matter how much of the book is true _ yes, the author
likes to drink vodka; yes, he likes attractive women; yes, he plays
golf; and yes, he's a male chauvinist. But the character is
fictional.
   ``From the letters I get, I know that a lot of people don't
understand that. They don't realize I was employing a novelistic
technique,'' Exley said. ``They think I'm hunched over the
typewriter with a water glass full of vodka, sloshed when I write.''
   He said he's not guilty of drinking while writing. ``I've never
written a line even with a hangover.''
   Because he shares the same name and similar life with his main
character, many people who read Exley believe they know him like
the next-door neighbor. College students in particular. They
affectionately and fondly write to him, telling him how insightful
and perceptive he is. Then, they leave large blocks of space for
his reply.
   ``What they're asking you to do is write their term paper for
them. Those go right in the ... trash basket,'' Exley said. ``They
think I'm so lyrical and I sit around and talk about (James) Joyce
and (Ernest) Hemingway, when actually I go to the bar and talk
about the same thing that the college girl's father who sells
refrigerators talks about.''
   Exley warns readers to stay on their toes with the closing scene
of ``Last Notes.''
   Robin, who has been cited for her endless delusions and lies,
seems to add a final fantasy to the heap by telling Exley she can
surf quite well. Exley, of course, believes it to be another wild
tale.
   But then, she climbs on the surfboard in her grandmother's
wedding gown and effortlessly puts on a surfing exhibition.
   Robin, who lies all the time, obviously doesn't. Maybe, Exley,
the author who writes about himself all the time, doesn't either.
   Perhaps the insistence of equating the character with the author
will subside anyway, now that Exley is working on his fourth book,
a spy thriller, that will introduce a new main character, Dan
Gunther, a St. Lawrence University professor and ex-Green Beret.
   ``I'm sick and tired of that Exley guy,'' he said.
   Will this new book take 13 years to finish?
   ``No way. I ain't gonna live 13 years.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Bob Bailey's Odyssey Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bob Bailey has been fired by Jim Bakker
and appeared in the movie ``Animal House.''
   His odyssey now continues in Nashville where he sings rhythm and
blues in a city more famous for its country licks and
cry-in-your-beer weepers. He has a new, well-crafted album, ``Bob
Bailey,'' with his version of Marvin Gaye's ``Inner City Blues''
and Stevie Wonder's ``Heaven Help Us All.''
   The LP is the latest addition to Bailey's bulging resume that
darts from the silver screen to the PTL Club to the Nashville
recording studios.
   Thirteen years ago, Bailey was singing in a nightclub in Eugene,
Ore., when the late John Belushi walked in and asked him to play a
bit part in ``Animal House.'' Bailey played piano in the movie as a
member of the band Otis Day and the Knights _ a band that also
included guitarist Robert Cray, later to become a top rock singer
and musician.
   ``He was a nice man,'' the 32-year-old Bailey recalled about
Belushi. ``He was out of control even back then. Several times they
delayed production so he could get his thoughts together. He loved
to party.
   ``He was a gifted performer and in the way he handled himself in
front of the camera, he was a master.''
   In 1978, Bailey began a three-year stint as a singer on the PTL
Club on television. He was one of seven members of the PTL Singers
and did some solos.
   He was fired in 1981 for refusing to sing on Sundays, his day
off, in the music department of a new PTL church in Charlotte, N.C.
   Bailey has mixed memories of Jim and Tammy Bakker, the leaders
of the PTL ministry at that time and stars of the PTL Club show.
   ``I think both Jim and Tammy were quite covetous of their
stardom and were not willing to share it with anyone,'' he said in
an interview. ``I think they misunderstood the concept of family
and that when one aspect or one member of the body does well, it
reflects on everybody and doesn't take away from anybody. They were
afraid their stardom or their position was being threatened by
myself and others. ...
   ``But on the other side, they could be very warm, giving,
supportive people. They were extremely kind to me and others on the
singing staff.
   ``It was a marvelous learning opportunity for me both
spiritually and musically and otherwise. This was one of the best,
if not the best, examples of how to do live television.''
   After leaving the PTL show, he moved to Nashville and continued
singing gospel music. In 1981, he released his first album, a
gospel LP titled ``Looking Forward.'' Then in 1984, he was a
finalist for a Grammy Award in gospel music for his second album,
``I'm Walkin'.''
   ``It was an interesting year,'' said Bailey, a native of
Middletown, Ohio, who was raised in Portland, Ore.
   Bailey, a native of Middletown, Ohio, who was raised in
Portland, Ore., also participated in the ``Exaltation'' album that
won a Dove Award from the Gospel Music Association for best worship
LP.
   He developed his songwriting talents and planned his move into
the rhythm and blues-urban contemporary field _ a step previously
undertaken by such stars as Aretha Franklin, Sam Cooke and Al Green.
   The first single release from his current album is ``Project
Girl,'' which carries a message of hope to young people born into
ghetto poverty. The song has the compelling line: ``She might be
poor but she ain't cheap.''
   ``I believe in music with a message,'' Bailey said. ``I believe
in the power of music. It reaches people's lives that can not be
reached otherwise. I want to be positive and sing songs that
inspire people and change their lives.''

   Three-year-old Stephanie Rendon's world is dark
and muffled, but she and other deaf-blind children are getting some
help they need to reach out and take the risks that lead to
learning.
   Stephanie already speaks a few words, signs about 15, is slowly
learning how to walk and is being toilet trained _ all major
accomplishments for a child born without any hearing or sight,
whose bright mind is difficult to reach.
   Most with her handicaps remain helpless, passive individuals,
unable to do anything but express the most basic needs.
   ``It is difficult to teach profoundly deaf-blind children
communication and language, so they function far below their
potential and usually as a retarded individual,'' said Cathee M.
Christensen, a San Diego State University associate professor of
communicative disorders.
   Christensen runs an experimental program at San Diego State
aimed at finding out how to motivate deaf-blind children to learn.
Four of about 25 profoundly deaf-blind San Diego County children
are participating in the program this year with another four
joining next year.
   The Education Department, which is spending $286,000 for two
years on the program, Freeman. Many
more children may not be included in that figure because states
report them under the category ``multiple, severely handicapped.''
   The Helen Keller National Center in New York estimates there are
between 30,000 and 40,000 deaf and blind adults in the United
States, said Freeman.
   Helen Keller, who became deaf and blind after a serious illness
at 19 months, went on to speak, read, earn a college degree and
become a writer, but that ``was a different story _ she had a few
years where she had hearing and sight,'' said Christensen. ``All
the kids we work with had nothing at all.
   A deaf-blind person's success in education depends on
intelligence, quality of education, level of parents' involvement,
whether training began at an early age and if they have any
residual hearing or sight, said Freeman.
   ``Children who are deaf and blind have so little data of sensory
stimulus you have to start out at ground zero. You have to
experiment to determine what motivates them, what works. It takes a
lot of time, a lot of patience.
   ``These children don't have concepts. They come to school
without knowing what a square is, or a ball ... But before you
teach them the concept of the mirror, you must establish some kind
of common link. Once you establish that, you can start their
education.''
   That's where Christensen's program comes in.
   With a student-teacher ratio of 1-3, it allows more personal
attention than is normal in programs for handicapped children, she
said.
   Much of the children's time is spent in a laboratory classroom,
where teachers use such devices as a hand-held microphone that
vibrates to sound waves, or puzzles made of various textured pieces.
   New teaching devices also are being developed through the
college's electrical and computer engineering department. For
example, a musical walker was built to encourage Stephanie _ who
wears hearing aids and responds to music _ to walk.
   Parents participate during the twice-weekly instruction, and
staff members make regular home visits. Therapy sessions are
videotaped and the children's oral and physical communication signs
are analyzed.
   Already there have been some revelations, Christensen said. Food
failed as a motivator, while a swimming pool and a trampoline
worked wonders.
   Standing with help from her gymnastics instructor during a
recent session, Stephanie swayed to the reggae beat of a children's
album before being led to a mini-trampoline for jumping exercises
that will strengthen her leg muscles so she can walk alone.
   Later in the pool the toddler, held by a swimming
instructor-communications student, slowly dragged her tongue _ a
chief sensory tool _ through the water. She stopped briefly to
cough up swallowed water, smiled, and then continued.
   Meanwhile, George Garcia, a skinny 9-year-old who a year ago
refused to do anything alone but lie down, jumped off a diving
board in the pool's deep end, oblivious to a crowd of children
watching him in awe.
   ``This program helps them to learn what is beyond their physical
appendages,'' Christensen said. ``It teaches them about exploration
of the environment, about what they can do with their bodies. My
theory is that will all come out enhancing cognitive and linguistic
development.''
   Besides being fun for Stephanie, the exercise is building up her
muscles, which are generally underdeveloped in deaf-blind children
because they don't move much on their own, said her mother, Janet
Rendon. ``For her the exercise has been fantastic.''
   George's mother, Mary Garcia, credits the physical program with
inspiring her son to more independence. He recently climbed steps
into a bus by himself, a motor development skill he perfected on
the pool's ladder.
   ``He's more active,'' Mrs. Garcia said. ``He's come a long way.''
   Stephanie, who hears somewhat muffled sounds through her hearing
aid, says ``hi,'' ``dadda,'' and ``mama,'' and signs such words as
``eat,'' ``water,'' ``music,'' ``bath,'' ``up,'' ``down,''
``happy,'' ``sad'' and ``no.''
   George began therapy at age 3 and also wears a hearing aid. He
says a few words and signs about a dozen to express basic needs,
but understands many more, Christensen said.
   ``I would have loved to see George at Stephanie's age to see
whether he was a passive non-learner at that point or whether
sitting at a desk or being treated as a retarded child has affected
him to the point where he doesn't have the same spark that
Stephanie does.''
   George's mother has been ill, limiting how much energy she could
put into shuttling him to school and therapy, Christensen said.
Mrs. Rendon, on the other hand, has made her only child's education
a full-time job, while her husband, James, works as a landscape
foreman.
   ``I've always had high expectations for her. The moment I found
out she was deaf and blind made me love her probably more than a
normal child,'' said Mrs. Rendon, who hopes Stephanie will become a
self-sufficient, communicating adult.
   In the meantime, she accepts compliments from strangers about
her cute, bright daughter, but adds, ``They don't see the pain and
anguish that went into making her the sweet little person she is.''

   Giving voice commands to a computer,
Batia directed her hand to shakily write out ``good morning'' in
Hebrew.
   A small accomplishment, but meaningful for the woman who has
been paralyzed from the neck down since an automobile accident five
years ago.
   Batia is one of a small group of quadriplegics at Tel Hashomer
Hospital working with an experimental computer that has restored
their ability to make some voluntary movements.
   Roger Natan, a mechanical engineering professor at Ben-Gurion
University in Beersheba, has spent 12 years developing the system
in which muscles are electrically stimulated by electrodes hooked
to a computer.
   ``We can write programs to control movement of the arm and to
get coordinated movements of the muscles,'' said Natan. ``From this
we can do different hand grips.
   ``The patient has control over it using voice commands which
trigger off programs in the computer.''
   With simple vocal commands like ``grip,'' Batia grasped a
felt-tipped pen with her right hand. She tightened her grasp by
saying ``more.''
   ``We are stimulating about 12 muscles in the arm, each one
individually, from our stimulator, and we are controlling this from
our microcomputer,'' Natan said.
   Batia's arm, resting on a metal support and wrapped in
electrodes, moved haltingly. The pen slipped from her hand. Natan
put it back.
   After a struggle lasting more than a minute, she wrote a shakey
but discernible ``boker tov,'' or good morning.
   ``I want to do it on my own,'' said Batia, a former computer
programmer for the Israeli army who declined to give her family
name for reasons of privacy.
   She said the device could be useful for other tasks such as
reading, eating, or even cooking. But she added, it would only be
possible ``with hard work and a lot of patience.''
   Natan said he had developed a pressure-sensitive pen to
compensate for uneven lateral movements of the arm brace.
   Others using the system include an 18-year-old man who lost the
use of his hands in a swimming pool accident and Soren Hershku, a
soldier paralyzed from the neck down in the 1976 Entebbe raid in
which Israeli commandos freed hijacked airline passengers from
Palestinian guerrillas in Uganda.
   The machine would not help some quadriplegics whose muscles have
atrophied to the point that they cannot be stimulated by electrical
impulse, Natan said. ``Generally if they're not used, muscles will
degenerate in a few years.''
   The electrical pulses are similar to those the brain normally
sends to the muscle, he said. ``The stimulator gives out brief
pulses which go in to the electrodes. They pass in one electrode,
go through the muscle and out the other electrode. The computer
controls the level of stimulation.''
   Natan, 41, an immigrant from London and a specialist in
bio-medical engineering, said he is now trying to reduce the
shelf-full of equipment to a shoe-box sized unit that can be used
in the home.
   ``The next stage is to miniaturize the electronics, to take
voice input computer and stimulator boxes and reduce them for a
portable unit,'' he said, adding he hoped to have the job done
within two years.

   Scattered across Leslie M. Loew's desk
are hundreds of color photographs of a battlefield in which the
victors devour the vanquished. It's a microscopic war that has been
fought for ages, and one that has serious consequences for humans.
   Loew studies the parasitic amoeba, so small that 1,000 could fit
on the head of a pin yet so powerful it causes a disease that
researchers say sickens an estimated 50 million people a year and
kills as many as 100,000.
   ``Most people think of the amoeba as the innocuous little
creature you learn about in school,'' said Loew, a University of
Connecticut Health Center physiologist. ``The fresh-water amoeba
that people play with is harmless.
   ``But one form is a parasite that lives in people and causes
amoebic dysentery. It is connected to sanitary conditions. It
occurs in tropical and subtropical climates.''
   The amoeba is one reason travelers are advised not to drink
water in foreign countries, he said. In Mexico, for instance, an
estimated 6 percent of the people are infected with the cell,
properly known as entamoeba histolytica.
   Scientists are interested in the parasitic amoeba because of its
ability to kill other cells. If they can understand how it kills,
they may be able to understand, for instance, how human cells kill
cancer cells.
   Loew, 41, began his research six years ago at the Weizmann
Institute of Science in Israel with Carlos Gitler, who discovered
the amoeba's hole-punching ability. Loew gets $100,000 a year from
the National Institutes of Health.
   ``The thing that fascinates is that it's a killer on an
individual cell level,'' said Loew, who has built a laboratory that
provides him with a close-up view of the killing. His microscope is
connected to a computer that enlarges and enhances images of the
cells. The images are sent to a still camera and video recorder,
providing photographs and videotape to examine.
   The victims appear as small, uniform circles that glow brightly.
The amoeba is a much larger, darker blob that approaches a cell,
gives a ``kiss of death'' and moves on. Within a short time, the
cell begins to die and fade. The amoeba eventually returns, engulfs
the cell and digests it.
   An active amoeba can eat up to 10 cells in an hour, Loew said.
   Research suggests that the amoeba punches holes in the membrane
of a cell it has ``kissed,'' Loew said. ``It delivers a little
packet, one part of which includes hole punching material and the
other part of which is toxins.''
   Scientists know that the hole-punching material is a protein,
they know it's molecular weight and they know some of its chemical
properties, Loew said. ``We have a pretty good handle on it. As for
the toxins, we know what they are, or we know what they do.''
   What's missing is an understanding of the mechanics, he said,
adding that the knowledge could lead to an understanding of how
human immune cells kill, and possibly the development of cures for
some diseases.

<HEAD>Bacterial Illness Linked To Raw Hot Dogs, Undercooked Chicken</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bacteria that can cause an often fatal infection
in infants and the elderly has been linked to the consumption of
raw hot dogs and undercooked chicken, says a government report.
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta found that
people infected with the bacteria listeria monocytogenes were
significantly more likely than others to have eaten raw hot dogs or
undercooked chicken, suggesting that those foods were the source of
the infection.
   In a report in The Lancet, a British medical journal, the CDC
said that infection with listeria, or listeriosis, was reported in
154 Americans in 1986 and 1987. One-third of the cases occurred in
newborns, who got the infection before birth from their mothers.
The rest occurred in the elderly and in people whose immune systems
were impaired for other reasons.
   Twenty-eight percent of those infected died, the CDC said.
   Several outbreaks of listeria have attracted wide attention
during the past few years. The outbreaks have occurred in
vegetables and more often in cheese or other dairy products.
   One of the most notable outbreaks, which occurred in 1985 in
California, led to 239 illnesses and 81 deaths.
   ``Our results add to a growing body of evidence that consumption
of contaminated food is a risk factor for listeriosis,'' the CDC's
report said. ``Although our findings need to be replicated, they
suggest that undercooked poultry and uncooked hot dogs need to be
added to a list of foods associated with listeriosis _ a list that
already includes vegetables and dairy products.''

<HEAD>Pediatricians Discourage Infant Exercise Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics has
recommended against structured exercise programs for infants,
saying there is no evidence they promote skills or provide any
long-term benefit to normal children.
   Adults may inadvertently exceed an infant's physical limitations
in such programs, the academy's committee on sports medicine said
this month in a policy statement.
   Most programs involve massage techniques and passive exercises,
and some involve the purchase of exercise equipment, the academy
said.
   Parents do not need specialized skills or equipment to provide a
stimulating environment, which is very important for infant
development, the committee said.
   ``An infant should be provided with opportunities for touching,
holding, face-to-face contact, and minimally structured playing
with safe toys. If these opportunities occur, an infant's intrinsic
motivation will guide his or her individual development course,''
the committee said.
   Later in the child's life, parents should exercise to set a good
example, prevent television-watching from taking up exercise time
and stress physical activities that the child can continue for a
lifetime, academy president Richard Narkewicz said in a telephone
interview.
   Lifelong activities including cycling, jogging, swimming,
running, fast walking and tennis, he said. Parents should also ask
schools to stress such activities, he said.

<HEAD>Nursing Home Residents To Get Massages In Psychiatric Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifteen nursing home residents will get
frequent massages in a study aimed at learning if the human touch
is better than medication in treating depression, withdrawal and
other behavior problems.
   ``Previous studies have demonstrated a strong psychological need
for touch in both humans and animals,'' said Dr. James Dietch, a
psychiatrist at the University of California, Irvine. ``Some
studies suggest touch may be as important as food.''
   Dietch said his study is meant to determine if inadequate
physical stimulation contributes to anxiety, withdrawal, violence
and depression among elderly nursing home residents suffering
Alzheimer's disease or other loss of mental powers.
   The study, supported by a $15,000 grant from the Retirement
Research Foundation, involves 30 patients at the Hillhaven Special
Care Unit, a 60-bed skilled nursing facility in Anaheim.
   After two weeks of physical tests and behavioral assessments, 15
of the patients will receive hour-long upper back and shoulder
massages three or four times weekly for six weeks starting in
mid-October. Nurses' aides will perform the massages. The other 15
patients won't get massages.
   ``We will try to address such issues as the extent to which
massage therapy can reduce a patient's need for tranquilizing
medication, the optimum amount of therapy needed to produce the
maximum benefit, identification of patients most likely to respond
to such treatment, and the cost effectiveness of the treatment,''
Dietch said.
   Sedatives and tranquilizers usually are used to treat behavior
problems among nursing home patients.
   Yet ``studies show that less than half the behaviorally
disturbed patients who receive these drugs benefit from them, and
many suffer adverse effects such as sedation, dizziness and
increased confusion,'' Dietch said. ``These drugs also have been
shown to increase the risk of falling, which can lead to serious
problems such as hip fractures.''

   Children who gave themselves morphine at the
touch of a button suffered less pain after major surgery than those
who had to call a nurse for shots, a new study says.
   The children, ages 5 to 15, reported significantly less pain in
the two days after their operations, said researcher Edwin Dodd.
   He reported preliminary study results Wednesday at the annual
meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. Dodd,
director of the Jackson Anesthesia Associates Pain Clinic in
Jackson, Miss., did the work while a fellow at the Bowman Gray
School of Medicine at Wake Forest University.
   ``Patient-controlled analgesia'' has become commonplace for
adults in the past five years. A patient who wants a dose of
painkiller pushes a button, which makes a pump adminster a small
dose through an intravenous line.
   To avoid overdoses, the pump puts a minimum amount of time
between doses. In Dodd's study, for example, children could get
morphine no more frequently than once every six minutes.
   Through random selection, half the 20 children in the study were
hooked up to a pump, while the others had the standard treatment of
calling a nurse for morphine shots. They were asked about the
degree of pain they were feeling right after surgery, and in the
mornings and afternoons of the following two days.
   They indicated their degree of pain on a 10-point scale that
featured five faces, ranging from a happy one to a crying one.
   As expected, both groups reported the same amount of pain
immediately after surgery, Dodd said. But each time they were asked
in the next two days, children on the pump averaged significantly
less pain than the other children did.
   No sign of addiction appeared in children using the pump, Dodd
said.

   Hang on to your seatbelts, home computing is about to enter its
teens.
   And if the rush of oncoming technology is anything like the rush
of hormones, home computing is going to see changes at least as
dramatic as puberty and maybe as painful.
   Figure the beginnings of personal computing from 1975, with the
introduction of the Altair 8800 to 1977 with Apple and Radio Shack.
Since the introduction of the IBM PC in 1981, the notion of a
personal computer has become commonplace and the very idea of
having one no longer draws much attention. Now the focus is what
the machines will do.
   For all the talk from hobbyists who have figured out ways to
computerize everything from sundials to switches, personal
computers for most of us do four things: They process words, they
count money, they play games, they file things.
   Word processing, financial spreadsheets, games and data bases
all existed before personal computers. They were called
typewriters, calculators and pencils, board games and filing
cabinets. Putting a computer to work on those tasks enhanced them
in some ways and made them easier to perform, but didn't basically
change them. A hand-calculated spreadsheet is exactly like a
computer-calculated spreadsheet, the difference being drudgery.
   The next few years of personal computing may see something
different springing from three major and interrelated developments.
The tremendous growth of processing power, data storage and
handling techniques and ``interconnectivity'' may contribute to
fundamental changes in many areas of ordinary life.
   Take processing power, the raw ability of a computer to handle
information. It has two ordinary measurements, the speed at which
the computer performs instructions and the number of bits (binary
digits) the machine is able to handle at once.
   The last 10 years or so have seen a change from machines that
could process around 800,000 instruction per second and handle 8
bits at a time to machines that rip through 20 million instructions
per second and handle 32 bits at a time.
   A machine with that power can handle multi-tasking (doing more
than one job at the same time) and can be equipped with very
sophisticated software. It isn't stretching things to say that the
individual can have more raw computing power sitting on a desktop
than was available in entire rooms of computer gear not many years
ago. A computer on that level is perfectly capable of running a
small home business in the basement, a terminal for word processing
and doing a search in a data base _ all at once.
   Even with the power of a single chip, more power and production
may be had by grouping the chips and having each of them work on a
different part of a given task at the same time. That's called
parallel processing and it's a computer version of ``many hands
make light work.''
   Since it's unreasonable to expect that the growth of computing
power is going to stop, it isn't outlandish to begin to wonder
whether our homes will replace individual computers for family
members with a central computer just as central heating replaced
the individual room fireplaces of an earlier time.

   That processing power increase is matched by new developments in
the technology of storing and retrieving information. CD-ROMS
(compact disk-read only memory) use lasers to encode and read
millions of characters of information in tiny pits on the surface
of a disk easily able to fit into a coat pocket. First popularized
as digital recording of music that wouldn't deteriorate with
multiple plays, CD-ROM technology can bring in-the-home access to
billions of characters of information. A single disk can hold more
than 500 million characters and reference-work disks are already
being published, including Grolier's Encyclopedia.
   A system that would allow you to store that many characters of
information and change any of it at will (read-write) has yet to
hit the marketplace, although at least one manufacturer, Tandy, has
announced plans. But even at the read-only level, the ability to
pack so much information in such a small space holds spectacular
promise. Teaching and entertainment programs that package realistic
video, sound and computer-aided interaction are possible on a level
formerly reserved for science fiction when the information that
would require a hand-truck load of bound books may fit comfortably
in pocket or purse.
   With the ability to store information escalating, the ability to
search it must keep pace and the developments in hypertext software
may do that. As an idea, hypertext dates back to World War II and
the term itself was coined more than 20 years ago, but this is data
base software with a difference: it allows you to search for things
in the same way scientists think you think, by association.
   Most data bases are sequential and organized according to some
artificial and fixed hierarchy, perhaps the alphabet or a number
system. A hypertext data base is different. Topics are linked by
association so that an examination of the topic ``apple'' could
flow into an examination of either ``tree'' or ``fruit'' or
``computer'' or ``orchards'' or ``cider,'' depending upon what you
wanted to know and what questions that prompted.
   A hypertext system, Hypercard, is already included with Mac
Plus, II and SE computers from Apple and other software is
available for MS-DOS machines.
   Finally, there is the beginning of something dubbed
``interconnectivity,'' defined as the ability to get different
machines from different mediums to work together and exchange
information. When you receive a facsimile transmission via the
telephone network on the facsimile board of your personal computer
and use OCR (optical character recognition) software and-or a
scanner to convert it into a digital form and then print the result
out on either a printer or a plotter while storing the information
on a magnetic disk, that's interconnectivity.
   Interconnectivity is also cellular telephones, and MIDI (musical
instrument digital interface) and the smart photocopy machines
called laser printers being used for desktop publishing. It's the
images scanned from a video camera and run through graphics
software to produce everything from T-shirts to art.
   Interconnectivity is also the beginning of order from the
often-chaotic marketplace, with the emergence of ``standards'' that
cut across more than one manufacturer's product line. Although
still in its infancy, interconnectivity should bring to gadgetry
what the interstate highway network brought to personal travel _
ease, speed and convenience in moving people, things and ideas
across borders.
   Of course, none of the above may happen. It may be back to quill
pens, parchment and candlelight, since there isn't a surefire way
to predict the future of anything as complicated as the application
of society's technologies to individual lives. But if we continue
in the directions that seem to be now the course, cornering the
goose-feather market for the next several years is probably not a
great investment.

   Klaus K. Obermeier used to compute only in his
office. Now that he has a laptop computer, he computes in the back
seat of the car, on the plane, beside the pool and even, he admits,
in bed.
   Obermeier, who works for Battelle Memorial Institute in
Columbus, Ohio, is the kind of person who is making laptop models
into one of the hottest segments of the computer business.
   Until recently, laptop computers tended to be underpowered and
overpriced, with small, poorly lit screens and batteries that ran
out at inconvenient times.
   Those problems have not been conquered completely, but enough
progress has been made to release a flood of pent-up demand among
business people, students, writers and others.
   Sales of laptop computers will surpass $1 billion in the United
States this year and are growing at a rate of 40 percent annually,
according to Dataquest Inc., a market researcher.
   This fall, in some ways, marks the coming of age of laptop
computers.
   Early in October, Toshiba Corp.'s U.S. arm introduced two
portable computers.
   The T5200, which uses Intel Corp.'s top-of-the-line 80386
microprocessor, is not a true laptop computer because it cannot run
on batteries. It is also heavier than most laptops, at just under
19 pounds.
   The T1600, which is built on Intel's 80C286 chip, can run on
batteries and weighs in at 11.6 pounds. Toshiba called it the top
of its battery-powered PC line.
   The T5200 has a suggested retail price of $9,499 to $10,999 and
will be available later this year. The T1600 is priced at $4,999
and will be available early next year, according to Toshiba America
Inc. in Irvine, Calif.
   NEC Home Electronics (U.S.A.) Inc., the U.S. arm of Japan's NEC
Corp., announced a new line of laptop computers, including the
thinnest, lightest one yet, a 4.4-pound model that could fit into a
12-inch by 9-inch inter-office envelope. The UltraLite has 90
percent of the power of the original IBM PC AT and starts at $2,999.
   NEC's ProSpeed 386 laptop resembles the high-powered machine
introduced by Toshiba except it is cheaper, it can run on batteries
and it has an optional ``docking station'' so it can be used as a
conventional desktop computer in the office. It starts at $7,699,
compared to $9,499 for Toshiba's.
   Compaq Computer Corp. was expected to follow in unveiling a new
model for the laptop market, and analysts say International
Business Machines Corp. will come out soon with a successor to its
2-year-old PC Convertible.
   As a sign of the market's importance, Zenith Electronics Corp.,
which dominates the government market for laptops, has made the
machines the linchpin of its entire data systems business.
   ``The laptop market is one that is coming into its own after
many years of really being a niche market,'' said Margaret
Rodenberg, vice president of marketing for Entre Computer Centers
Inc., a retail chain.
   Laptop computers have always gotten good press, perhaps because
journalists were some of their earliest users. Tandy Corp.'s Radio
Shack TRS 80 Model 100 even earned an affectionate nickname on the
campaign trail _ the ``Trash 80.''
   But people who needed more computing power shied away from them.
John Vanden Brink, a consultant in Des Plaines, Ill., said he once
destroyed an entire data base when he tried to transfer something
out of his Radio Shack and exceeded the memory limit.
   The newest models, in contrast, are loaded with power.
   The problem with speedy computers is they are ravenous for
electricity and drain batteries quickly. Seizing an opportunity,
Chips and Technologies Inc. of San Jose, Calif., recently
introduced a set of chips that will double or triple the length of
time that many laptops can run on batteries.
   Prices for laptops are relatively high _ $2,000 to $10,000 _
because of the expense of the batteries, energy-saving CMOS memory
chips and the complex technology of flat screens.
   The flat screens of laptops flip up like the top of a clamshell
and usually display 25 lines at a time, in comparison to the 40
lines of a regular personal computer. Brightness and contrast,
although much improved, still don't match those of full-sized PCs.
   Once on the road, laptop owners have abundant headaches: No
place to recharge batteries, no modular phone jacks, hotel phone
switches that can't handle data transmissions, 3{-inch disks that
aren't compatible with other people's 5\-inch disks.
   Still, something keeps laptop users tapping away.
   Laptops, like cellular phones, allow people to keep working
while others are stuck in traffic or thumbing through the in-flight
magazine. They also encourage spontaneity by letting people record
or try out ideas while they are fresh.

   In a scene from the futuristic movie ``Robocop,'' a shiny silver
disc is inserted into a playback machine to produce a recorded
audio-video message on a wall of television monitors.
   Video from what looks like a compact disc?
   Yes, and you don't have to wait until the year 2000 to have
CD-video in your home. Actually, there were laser videodiscs before
audio compact discs; the videodisc format dates back to 1978.
   This year, laser video is trying to create a new image. It's
being touted as CD-video, a format that offers the best of both
worlds to audio-videophiles.
   Like its audio CD cousin, the videodiscs offer true digital
sound on many programs. But instead of just music, the library of
videodiscs includes classic and current movies, concerts,
educational material and operas.
   CD-video programming appears on discs of three different sizes,
5-, 8-, and 12-inch.
   The 5-inch ``gold'' CD-video singles have a capacity of five
minutes of digital audio with video, plus 20 minutes of additional
digital audio per side.
   Programming on the 8- and 12-inch discs _ they're silver-colored
_ are primarily all video-audio. The 8-inch discs can hold up to 20
minutes of both video and audio material per side; the 12-inch
discs boost the time to 60 minutes per side.
   Players, currently in playback-only format, are manufactured by
Pioneer, Magnavox, Yamaha and Sony.
   Players can be bought for under $500, but one with all the
frills will list out at about $2,000. Some of the players use only
the 8- and 12-inch videodiscs, but newer ``combination'' models
play all consumer optical discs.
   No matter which player is selected, the audio-video quality
cannot be matched. Signal-to-noise ratio on the audio portion of
CD-video players is rated 97 decibels or better. The players offer
420-425 lines of horizontal resolution, providing an exceptional
picture.
   Since the discs are ``read'' by a low-power laser beam, there is
no wear on them.
   CD-video singles list for about $10, with feature films ranging
from $35 to $50. In many instances, a movie on laser video will
cost less than videotape.
   CD-video also offers jitter-free freeze frame and slow motion,
plus a variety of other programming capabilities. Pick out a
favorite song from an entire concert on a 12-inch disc and the
player can search it out in a matter of seconds and play it.
Consumers can also program a player to scan for a single frame of a
movie and freeze it on the screen.
   A search through a CD-video brochure reveals art collections and
an encyclopedia, as well as games and programs from NASA, National
Geographic and other special interest discs.

   Electronics fans seem to be getting a chance
to pause and catch their breath this year, a time between surges in
technology.
   The most popular innovations of recent years, compact disc
players and videocasette recorders, are now in millions of homes.
Indeed, sales of videocasette recorders have dipped for the first
time.
   And the items expected to mark the next great tides on the
market _ digital audio tapes and high definition television _
aren't yet on the market.
   ``In the past year there's been nothing really new, but there's
been sort of a penetration on all levels of what's out there,''
commented electronics writer Peter McWilliams.
   Mark V. Rosenker of the Electronic Industries Association
stressed the continuing ``tremendous markets for stereo, color
television, compact disc'' and other items that have become popular
in the last couple of years.
   ``VCRs have grown up, they are in more than half the homes in
america,'' he said. And now attention is turning to the innovations
of the future, particularly high definition television.
   Consumers are improving what they have, moving up to a better,
more complex, versions of VCRs and other items, but there's no
product that retailers are worried about being able to keep in
stock for Christmas, reported the author of ``Peter McWilliams
Personal Electronics Book.''
   Producers sold 13.2 million VCRs last year, down from 13.5
million the year before, the Electronic Industries Association
reports, the first decline in sales for these popular devices.
   That probably indicates that most of the folks initially
interested in such new technology have a VCR, commented McWilliams.
   But that doesn't meen sales will fall sharply, he added, since
this is a time when many people will want to move up to a better
model.
   Prices have fallen, McWilliams noted, so many people will be
shopping for VCRs with more features. Others, confronted with a
possibly large repair bill for an older set, will likely decide to
buy a new, more sophisticated model, he added.
   This year's consumer electronics show was ``kind of dull,'' said
McWilliams. ``What's out there is getting better and better,'' but
he found nothing so new that everyone is going to want to run out
and buy it.
   One minor chance for a trend, he said, is portable video, small
television-VCR combinations being produced by Sony and Casio which
people can take with them on trips. But, McWilliams added, these
are new and thus costly.
   ``Video games have made a strange resurgence,'' this year, he
added, ``they have kind of revitalized the whole video game market.
That surprised a lot of people.''
   Sales seem to be doing best ``among kids that don't remember
that video games aren't popular any more, so they want them,'' he
added. Also, some makers have begun marketing ``golden oldies''
video games such as ``Pong'' in forms than can be played on more
modern machines.
   Another curiosity, he said, is a resurgence in video discs,
which seems to be being pushed by Sony.
   Rosenker's emphasis was on the future, with standard setting now
under way for the improved high-definition television systems.
   The system could offer pictures with double the clarity of those
now available, but aren't likely to hit the marketplace until 1992
or later, he said.
   Meanwhile, audio combination units are proving popular, allowing
consumers to buy a product that includes a compact disc player,
tape player and radio. Sales are strong and growing for home
computers, cordless telephones and microwave ovens also, as well as
electronic toys, home security systems and other products.

   While video purveyors promote sharper pictures and bigger
screens, audio manufacturers are shouting about sounds that try to
reproduce the movie theater experience at home.
   The operative word is ``surround.''
   ``As the quality of televisions and VCRs continue to improve,
consumers are looking for better performance from their audio
products as well,'' says Brian Williams, director of product
planning and merchandising for NEC Home Electronics.
   He says that more than 1,400 movies in the home video market
have been recorded in Dolby surround sound, increasing the demand
for products that can re-create movie theater sound effects at home.
   Surround sound technology uses a minimum of four speakers.
Decoders, amplifiers and receivers connect directly into most
existing home audio systems, Williams says.
   There are other types of high-quality video speakers, as well. A
recent issue of Video magazine analyzed them:
   _ Powered: A powered speaker is one with a built-in amplifier.
The main advantage of having a speaker with an amplifier built-in
is that it can be plugged into the audio output of any audio-video
component, even one without an amplifier, making for elegantly
simple audio systems. Powered speakers range in price from $200 to
$380 per pair.
   _ Cordless: Video speakers you can hang on a wall or perch on
bookshelves without unsightly cables or wires trailing behind them.
Cordless speakers employ a number of techniques to achieve their
``cordlessness,'' including an infrared transmitter that plugs into
the headphone jack of an audio amp or a monitor-receiver. It sends
audio signals to the speakers, which must be located within the
line of sight.
   _ Shielded speakers are those that lend themselves to video use
without unduly sacrificing audio quality. Speakers not shielded for
use near a tube can't be moved close to the set. Shielded speakers
are manufactured by Fisher, NEC, Pioneer, Quasar, RCA, Sony and
Technics, among others, and range in price from $50 to $1,000 a
pair. Without a shield, the magnet inside the speaker can distort
the video picture and bend or change the color.
   And for those who'd like to eliminate any physical appearance of
speakers from their living rooms, Pioneer offers the BSS-F1
Bodysonic chair. Retailing for about $2,000, it's a cushy black
leather swivel chair with 3.2-inch diaphragm ear speakers and a
subwoofer in the seat. It has its own surround sound processor.

   Only about half the adults who have a computer
at home actually use it as opposed to nearly three-quarters of all
children, the Census Bureau reports.
   Youngsters use computers for learning and for games, and many
children are also exposed to the machines in school, said bureau
statistician Robert Kominski.
   Even though many adults use computers at work, the home computer
may have been bought by one adult for a specific use, and not be of
interest to others in the home, Kominski suggested.
   In addition, many computers were bought ``as learning tools and
game machines for children,'' he said. ``So there probably are
quite a few situations in households where children use a computer
and not the adults at all.''
   The report was based on a survey taken in October 1984, the only
time the bureau has looked at computer use. The report was delayed
because of other priorities, he said.
   Computer use has skyrocketed from the nearly 7 million home
computers in use at the time of the survey.
   International Data Corp., a Boston-based market research group,
estimates that the number of homes with computers reached nearly
16.5 million as of last year.
   Electronic Industries Association, a trade group, estimates the
total at 17.6 million homes as of January.
   While it deals with a time when fewer machines were in use, the
census analysis is the first detailed look at who owns and uses the
machines.
   Of 221 million Americans aged 3 and over in 1984, more than one
in five _ 21.1 percent _ reported using computers in some direct
way.
   Among children aged 3 to 17, 15.3 percent had a computer at
home, and 74.2 percent of those used it. Of those enrolled in
school, 28 percent reported using computers.
   Among youngsters, the study found, boys generally use computers
more than girls.
   ``If you want to risk saying anything is a sociocultural
difference at this time, that's certainly where it lies,'' Kominski
said. ``People who study computer games find boys use these things
much more than girls do, they go to video parlors more, and they
use computers more at home and school too.''

   American schools have only one computer for
every 30 students and even those pupils with access to computers
get to use them an average of just one hour a week, according to a
report to Congress.
   The report by the congressional Office of Technology Assessment
said ``today's classrooms typically resemble their ancestors of 50
years ago more closely than operating rooms or business offices
resemble their 1938 versions.''
   The agency estimated that schools have spent $2 billion on
computer hardware over the past decade. There are now 1.2 million
to 1.7 million computers in public schools, and fewer than 5
percent have no computers.
   But the agency said it would cost $4 billion to buy enough
equipment to reduce the student-computer ratio from 30-to-1 to
3-to-1.
   The 246-page report, based on two years' research, said that
between 1981 and 1987 the percentage of schools equipped with
computers for instructional use grew from 18 percent to 95 percent.
   But ``the vast majority of schools still do not have enough of
them to make the computer a central element of instruction,'' it
said.
   Computers are not the only new machines in American classrooms.
   ``The 1980s witnessed a tremendous expansion in school use of
advanced technology of all types,'' the report said.
   ``In 1980 very few schools had videocassette recorders. Today
roughly 90 percent do,'' it said, adding that the availability of
cable and satellite transmission has made the television a more
potent teaching tool _ especially for schools in remote areas.
   ``In practice there is wide disparity _ one computer in a
classroom, clusters of computers in the library or classrooms, full
computer laboratories and classrooms with no computers,'' it said.
``Not all students use computers and ... those who do spend on
average a little more than one hour per week on the computer.''
   The report said that ``although new interactive technologies
cannot alone solve the problems of American education, they have
already contributed to important improvements in learning. These
tools can plan an even greater role ... both by helping children
acquire basic skills and by endowing them with more sophisticated
skills so they can acquire and apply knowledge over their
lifetimes.''
   It said there are more than 10,000 educational software products
on the market, but the quality ``could be much better.''
   The Office of Technology Assessment is a nonpartisan analytical
agency for Congress. The report was commissioned by the House
Committee on Education and Labor.

   In 1932, when the General Electric J100 radio was introduced, it
cost a then-impressive $99 for the family to gather around and
listen to comedian Jack Benny, bandleader Benny Goodman and the
``Buck Rogers'' serial.
   Today, GE is selling a re-created version of that living room
radio, at three-quarter scale, for $75.
   Fifty-six years ago, the typical table radio had a wooden
cabinet, weighed 40 pounds, consumed 100 watts of electricity and
required a 50-foot antenna, GE says. The replica consumes
one-twentieth of the power, has two built-in antennas and weighs
five pounds.

   Taking a cue from the automobile industry, some companies are
beginning to offer extended warranty packages on consumer
electronics products.
   Some offer packages that can cover the component for up to three
years after purchase of the videocassette recorder, television,
tuner or other home electronics product.
   ``Dealers like them,'' says Robert P. Minnick, president of
ComponentGuard Inc., of the plans, ``because they add an attractive
dimension to their sales effort and the customer is secure in the
knowledge that if the product fails within the contracted period it
will be serviced and repaired at no cost.''
   ComponentGuard is an extended warranty service plan company
headquartered in New York.
   The plans vary, Minnick says, with some designed to cover high
quality equipment, and others providing a toll-free
customer-assistance telephone number for trouble-shooting damages.
   Basic service plans might cover parts and labor on ``lower end''
items, while more comprehensive plans take the warranty coverage
further. One ComponentGuard plan, for example, offers a guarantee
that the covered product will meet the original manufacturer's
specifications.
   Most independent warranty companies are backed by insurance
firms, says Minnick, providing more investment security.

   Television sports announcer John Madden has one in his private
bus, the Maddencruiser.
   Singer Willie Nelson has a collapsible one atop his bus, the
Honeysuckle Rose.
   The firefighters at the remote fire camp along the western
border of the Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming got one to while
away the hours during their time off.
   Mickey Mantle has two of them.
   An estimated 2 million homes in America have satellite TV
systems, with access to some 150 channels of programming, says
Chuck Hewitt, president of the Satellite Broadcasting and
Communications Association of America (SBCA), who estimates there
could be 10 million by the mid-1990s.
   By then, he says, today's 8-to-10-foot will have given way to
smaller 18-to-24-inch dishes.
   The cost for an average system, says Hewitt, is about $2,500.
   Hewitt says satellite TV owners can receive 5,300 sporting
events a year, as well as movies, children's and family programs,
news, weather, concerts, stock market information and college
courses.
   Private homes (or buses) aren't the only receivers. Many private
television networks have been established to provide outlets for
business and nin-profit corporations.
   ``I've been amazed at how many churches have used memorial funds
to purchase a satellite dish,'' said Pat Correll of the United
Methodist Church's network in Nashville, Tenn. She said 25,000
Sunday school leaders recently viewed a three-session workshop
aired at 350 sites nationwide. The J.C. Penney merchandising chain
is equipping 650 of its largest stores with satellite dishes.
   There are 12,000 receiving sites with satellite dishes around
the country, up from several hundred a few years ago, said Elliott
Gold, publisher of Business TV magazine in Altadena, Calif. He
predicts 42,000 locations by 1992.
   Receiving sites cost about $5,000 apiece to build; sending sites
to beam the signal to a satellite run $200,000 to $300,000, said
Louis Bransford of the Public Service Satellite Consortium,
comprised of churches, trade groups, educators and health
organizations using television.
   One obstacle to the growth of the home satellite industry has
been the issue of piracy.
   Federal Communications Commission official Richard Smith
recently estimated that nearly half of the satellite dishes used to
receive pay TV programs have illegal devices that unscramble the
picture, and let the viewer watch for free.
   ``If unchecked,'' FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick has said, the
growth of the illegal chips threaten ``the viability of the
satellite-to-home program market.''
   
   Patrick has said the devices not only steal from those who
created the programming, but from viewers who pay for the service
and may lose it if the problem is not brought under control.

   Home video is an integral part of most American households
today, with some 60 percent of American households having a
videocassette recorder, but it's not that long ago that home video
was in its infancy.
   A recent issue of Video magazine recounted the milestones in the
short history of video.
   The first practical videotape recorder was introduced at the
National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters
convention in the early '50s, says Video. The Ampex VTR was almost
as big as a room and cost more than $100,000, making it practical
only for professional use.
   After many attempts to develop a consumer-acceptable home taping
system, Sony finally delivered the SL-7200 in 1975, kicking off the
home video revolution. With a maximum one-hour taping time and no
pre-recorded video available to speak of, owners of the new Sony
VCR were restricted to taping programs off broadcast television.
Victor Co. of Japan, a subsidiary of Matsushita, debuted its
competing VHS format the following year.
   Pre-recorded movies appeared in 1980 when Magnetic Video signed
with 20th Century Fox to distribute 50 movies. These included
``Patton,'' ``The French Connection,'' ``Hello Dolly,'' ``The Sound
of Music'' and ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.'' It would be
a few more years before video stores and rental videos began to
appear.
   The first home video cameras were introduced in 1980, reports
Video magazine.
   In the fall of 1983, the first camcorder appeared on the scene.
The Sony BMC-110 Betamovie camcorder combined all the taping
essentials _ camera, VCR (record only), and power source _ in a
six-pound package.
   The Akai 7350 VCR, introduced in 1981, was the first
stereophonic VHS deck and featured Dolby noise reduction.

   A National Cable Television Center and
Museum has opened to preserve the roots of an industry that in 40
years has gone from using simple wires leading from a shared
antenna to satellites.
   More than 30 past and present cable television executives and
cable TV ``aficionados'' gathered at the opening of the center and
museum at Penn State University Oct. 4.
   Among the displays at the museum are an old RCA television with
gauges added to measure the strength of a cable signal, a model of
the first satellite uplink truck, papers, photographs and other
memorabilia.
   The center also includes a room with oral histories from cable
pioneers and information about cable companies around the country;
a viewing room for a videotape collection now being gathered; and a
conference room.
   Marlowe Froke, a Penn State professor and the center's director,
said students taking courses in cable television and scholars would
get a good idea of the industry's history from the exhibits.
   ``It provides a dramatic visualization of some of the history of
the industry that couldn't be captured in conventional textbooks,''
Froke said.
   Benjamin J. Conroy Jr., chairman of the board of the museum,
said he hoped the museum would expand beyond its temporary location
in a building basement.
   ``While this is a good start, it's only a beginning,'' said
Conroy, who is from Austin, Texas. He said he hoped the museum one
day would occupy a building or at least its own wing in a building.
   Since the early cable stations, the industry's technical
know-how and audience has increased dramatically.
   Cable television began in 1948 in Pennsylvania and Oregon and
quickly spread to remote communities across the country that
couldn't pick up standard TV signals.
   Microwave was used in cable television for the first time in
1953 and experimental satellite systems were tested in 1973 as the
number of viewers increased.
   More than 42 million viewers in 20,000 communities now receive
cable television, close to 60 percent of all TV viewers.
   Most of the funding for the museum and center came from Cable
Television Pioneers, National Cable Televisions Association and
Community Antenna Television Association.

   Millions of eyes today are focused on computer monitors or video
display terminals, whether at work, home or school.
   While studies have shown no indications that these monitors
cause vision problems, the American Optometric Association has some
advice on ways to reduce eye stress and fatigue when working on the
terminals with prolonged concentration.
   _ Take a 10- or 15-minute rest break every hour.
   _ Use glasses with a mild near vision prescription for wear only
when using the video display terminal.
   _ Room lighting for video display terminal work should be about
half that recommended for general office work, or a 30- to
50-footcandle level, about the equivalent of a 60-watt bulb in a
small room.
   _ The light source should not reflect directly on the screen.
   _ For maximum comfort and ease of seeing, flexibility is the
key: You should be able to adjust the table, chair, screen
brightness and contrast, monitor position and keyboard to meet
individual needs.
   _ Copyholders should be adjustable to hold reference material at
the same height and distance as the screen, eliminating the need to
change focus when looking from one to the other.

   The television of the future will be a high definition system
with the clarity of movie film and the sound of compact discs, say
representatives of the broadcast and electronics industries.
   The Federal Communications Commission recently endorsed the
advanced television systems, declaring them in the public interest,
and approving some preliminary rules for bringing them into
American homes.
   But the commission said many technical and procedural problems
still must be ironed out, and the systems probably will not be
available from the U.S. broadcast industry before 1993.
   U.S. broadcasters are concerned that U.S. research efforts to
develop an industry transmission standard for high definition TV
may not be moving fast enough to head off a probable Japanese
invasion of the new technology.
   The Japanese have been working on an advanced system for two
decades and expect to introduce high definition TV to homes in
their country in 1990.
   The picture on a standard television set in the United States is
produced by a signal that scans more than 200,000 dots on 525
lines. The Japanese system has 1,125 scanning lines.
   Michael Rau, National Association of Broadcasters vice president
for science and technology, said the FCC made a ``strong commitment
to bring advanced TV to the public. They seemed to reaffirm support
for free, over-the-air broadcasting. But the commission must solve
the difficulties of delivering the system over broadcast outlets.''
   In a series of preliminary rulings, the FCC said:
   _ Existing broadcasters and stations are best equipped to bring
the new system to viewers.
   _ Advanced television programs must be received on existing
television sets so viewers won't have to replace their equipment.
   _ If additional frequency space is needed, it should be found
within existing VHF and UHF television bands. The FCC found that
looking for frequencies outside those bands would delay the
service, and noted that bands now suitable for the systems are in
use for other purposes.

   Silicon Graphics Inc. is producing a computer
work station with three-dimensional graphics that is priced at less
than $16,000, a direct challenge to neighbor Sun Microsystems Inc.
   Sun Microsystems' least expensive three-dimensional graphics
work station starts at slightly more than $30,000.
   Work stations are fast versions of personal computers and are
used mainly by scientists, engineers and, lately, business and
finance professionals.
   Silicon Graphics, which like Sun is based in Mountain View,
Calif., already has a line of work stations priced from $45,000 to
$90,000. That line has captured about 25 percent of the $600
million high-end work station market, according to the current
issue of Business Week.
   The Personal Iris is the cheapest member of a new family of work
stations, including six members of the Iris Power family that start
at $54,900.
   IBM and Digital Equipment Corp. are preparing to make major
moves into the work station market, which has been dominated by the
likes of Sun, Silicon Graphics and Apollo Computer Inc. of
Chelmsford, Mass.

   Computer use at home has skyrocketed to an estimated 17.6
million homes, according to the Electronic Industries Association,
a trade group, with women more likely than men to be the users.
   More than 11 million women are currently working from home,
either full time or part time, according to a 1987 survey by Link
Resources, a New York-based consulting firm.
   As a result, finding room for a work-at-home office has become a
common remodeling goal.
   Some tips for creating an office at home from Kimball Office
Furniture:
   _ The most comfortable height for working at a computer keyboard
is 3 to 4 inches lower than standard desk height. Neck and back
strain will result if elbows are raised more than 3 to 4 inches
above the keyboard.
   If it is impossible to provide a surface for that, use a desk
chair with an adjustable height. Feet should rest flat on the floor.
   _ Avoid glare from windows or poorly-placed lights. Shades or
curtains on the windows and task lighting on the work space allows
best control of lighting.
   _ To quiet a noisy printer, place a pad under the printer, or
store it in a cabinet or even another room. Be sure to allow space
for continuous feed paper.

   DAT: Digital audio tape.
   DATA BASE: The collection of all data used and produced by a
computer program. (Also called data bank.)
   DISK: A revolving plate on which data and programs are stored.
Hard disks are rigid magnetic disks in a sealed container; a fast,
auxiliary storage device that makes large numbers of programs and
information available for instant access. Floppy disks, or
diskettes, are flexible disks that provide low-cost storage and are
used widely with minicomputers and microcomputers. They come in
8-inch, 5\-inch and 3{-inch diameters.
   The disk drive is the part of the computer that reads or writes
information on a magnetic disk and moves data and programs between
the disk and the computer's memory.
   DOS: An acronym for disk operating system. It is composed of one
or more diskettes on which data can be stored and one or more disk
drives to read the information stored on the disks.
   K: Abbreviation for kilobyte. It means 1,024 bytes. Similarly,
64K means 64 times 1,024 bytes or 65,536 bytes, not 64,000.

   Some 8.2 percent of households, or 6.9 million, owned a home
computer, according to Census Bureau report released earlier this
year.
   The report was based on a survey taken in October 1984, the only
time the bureau has looked at computer use.
   Ownership was most likely in households with incomes of $50,000
or more, 22.9 percent. Only 1.7 percent of households with incomes
under $10,000 had a computer.
   People aged 34 to 44 were most likely to own computers. Those
with children were three times more likely to have a machine than
were the childless.
   Of the 15 million adults in computer households, 53.3 percent
reported using the machine. Use by men was 63.1 percent, compared
to 48.2 percent of women. Usage was highest in the 25 to 34 age
group.
   Nearly one-fourth, 24.6 percent of all employed adults, used a
computer at work. Women were more likely to use them at home, 29.0
percent to 21.2 percent for men.

   The consumer electronics industry finished 1987 with a record
$30.69 billion in sales and should surpass $32.24 billion in 1988,
according to figures compiled by the Washington, D.C.-based
Electronics Industries Association.
   The video segment of the electronics market is expected to lead
in sales again in 1988, with $13.402 billion in sales projected.
Audio equipment is expected to reach $8.525 billion in sales. Home
information equipment such as home computers, telephones and phone
answering devices should account for $4.960 billion in sales, it
was projected.
   Related products, from computer softwear to audio and video
accessories, should account for $5.360 billion in sales, the
association said.

   The head of the New York Stock Exchange said
last October's crash was caused by internal technical market
problems and not economic changes, and he defended trading halts to
avoid another meltdown.
   In an interview Friday, John Phelan conceded the ``circuit
breakers'' proposal for coordinated trading halts with other
exchanges is an artificial restraint on the free-trading system,
which he dislikes in theory.
   ``I think all of us in general don't like to shut markets down
because it ruins liquidity,'' Phelan said. ``But there are a few
points in time when you need to shut it down.''

   Saudi Arabia, seeking to restore order
to OPEC's pricing system, is increasing pressure on overproducing
cartel members by stepping up its own oil output _ and industry
analysts predict the tactic will work.
   The strategy _ which has forced the price of oil dramatically
lower _ will enable the Saudis and other members of the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stake out
positions prior to key meetings expected to be held this month and

   Clifton E. Haley, Budget's president, said Friday the company
``has retained the firm of Morgan Stanley and Co. to explore
strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder values, including a
possible sale of Budget.''
   The decision reflects the board's belief that the market price

   Stock prices moved higher Monday, gaining ground
mostly on the back of Wall Street's buoyant performance on Friday.
   However, trading activity was quiet and further gains were
limited by weekend statements by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson, dealers said.
   Lawson indicated in a television interview he would push up
interest rates if the pound fell. On Monday, the pound was trading
higher than Friday's closing levels.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 6.9
points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,851.6 at midday.
   Volume was light, as 236.9 million shares changed hands,
compared with 373.1 million shares at the same time Friday.
   Trading activity focused primarily on special situations, as a
handful of stocks rose on takeover speculation.
   But underpinning the overall market was Friday's sharp gain in
New York, where the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 42.50
points to 2,150.25. The Wall Street rally followed the release of
U.S. unemployment figures, which showed slower-than-expected growth
in September, helping to ease fears of a further increase in
interest rates.

<HEAD>UAW Members Ratify Deere Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOLINE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deere & Co. says its new three-year contract
with the United Auto Workers will keep the farm machinery maker
competitive, while also giving union members their first pay raise
since 1981.
   ``It gives us a framework to successfully operate in a very
competitive environment,'' Deere spokesman Robert Combs said Sunday
after union members ratified the pact giving them a raise, better
retirement benefits and increased job security.
   The ratification followed months of negotiations and prevented a
repeat of the bitter five-month strike in 1986-87 that ended with
the union accepting a wage freeze and other concessions.
   The new contract, which covers 13,500 employees in Illinois,
Iowa, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Denver, takes effect immediately.
   UAW Secretary-Treasurer Bill Casstevens said it was approved by
a 90 percent margin, but the union declined to give the actual vote
totals.
   The contract gives workers at Deere, the nation's leading
manufacturer of farm implements, an average pay raise of 44.3 cents
an hour in the first year, followed by lump-sum payments equal to 3
percent of their base salary in each of the second and third years.
   Average earnings under the old contract were $15.47 per hour, or
$32,177 a year based on a 40-hour week.
   Deere's union workforce has not received a general pay raise
since 1981. The company has given cost-of-living increases using a
formula tied to the consumer price index.
   The contract also calls for a three-step increase in early
retirement benefits. The monthly pension benefit for those on early
retirement go from $1,205 to $1,400 the first year, to $1,500 the
second year and $1,600 in the third.
   The union also won important safeguards protecting workers from
layoff.
   The union now plans to resume contract negotiations with
Caterpillar Inc.
   Caterpillar, a leading manufacturer of earth-moving equipment,
and the union agreed to extend their contract, originally set to
expire Sept. 30, until the Deere talks were completed.
   The Caterpillar contract affects 17,500 factory workers in five
states.

   The stock market was little changed today in a
slow Columbus Day session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 0.18 to 2,150.07
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 371 up, 460 down and
503 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 16.68 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The market had trouble extending Friday's strong rally in the
absence of many investors who were taking Columbus Day off.
   The market for government securities, which sets the tone for
interest rates, did not operate today.
   Still, analysts said traders were heartened by the news on
Friday of smaller-than-expected employment growth in September.
   The resulting rally in the bond and stock prices carried
stock-market indicators near or, in some cases, past the levels
they reached in early July, which marked their peaks since the
crash a year ago.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone & Telegraph
rose [ to 26|; American Express gained ] to 29[; International
Business Machines added \ to 116\, and Chrysler was up [ at 24|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .18 to 156.63. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index rose .22 to 304.04.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 42.50 points
to 2,150.25, falling just short of its 1988 closing high of
2,158.61 reached on July 5.
   For the week, the average rose 37.34 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 3 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 1,135 up, 389 down and 417 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 216.35 million shares, against 153.57
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Most Market Crash Complaints Still Hanging</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors staggered by last year's stock
market crash still are trying to sort through their finances,
unable to get complaints against their brokers resolved, state
securities regulators say.
   Two out of three small investors who experienced problems during
the stock market crash have not been able to get a resolution of
their complaints, according to the findings of a survey released
Sunday.
   The North American Securities Administrators Association said
its survey also showed that 82 percent of investors now have less
confidence in securities markets and one out of every seven
investors has left the market entirely.
   ``A lot of people with unresolved complaints don't know where to
go for help,'' said John Baldwin, the new president of the
association, which represents state regulatory offices. ``Our
survey shows that these burned investors are not rushing back into
the arms of Wall Street.''
   Of those still in the market, 29 percent said they had
substantially less money invested now and two-thirds said they had
changed or were planning to change brokerage firms.
   Baldwin, director of the Utah Securities Division, said it was
important for investors to know what help was available to get
complaints resolved. He called it particularly disturbing that 40
percent of investors who had incomes of $30,000 a year or less had
taken no action to resolve their complaints, suggesting a lack of
sophistication among these investors about how to proceed.
   Baldwin said a good place to seek help is the securities
regulatory bureau in the state where the investor lives. Baldwin
said state regulators often are able to get results simply by
getting the brokerage firm and the investor together to discuss the
problem.
   He said taking the case through arbitration or filing a court
suit are also options, although time-consuming. The survey found
that of the cases which had gone to court, 90 percent were still
pending while 87 percent of the arbitration cases were unresolved.
   The association, which released the survey results at its
convention in Santa Fe, N.M., said the typical respondent was a
male, aged 55 or older, with a gross income of around $30,000, who
had lost between $1,000 and $5,000 in the stock market crash.
   Half of the respondents to the survey complained that their
brokers executed trades late or got them wrong during the hectic
period surrounding the Oct. 19 crash.
   The next most common gripes were that brokers had misled
investors or put them in unsuitable investments, such as highly
risky ventures for a customer without a lot of money to lose.
   Asked about the disposition of their complaints, 64 percent of
those responding said their problems were still unresolved. Only
3.6 percent had been lucky enough to get a resolution in less than
one month.
   The survey turned up a number of horror stories from what
Baldwin termed the ``invisible victims'' of Black Monday:
   _ An elderly woman in Wausau, Wis., wrote, ``I have lost $5,000
and it hurts, because I lost my husband in March 1988 and depended
on him for support. The Social Security check does not cover all
the expenses in a month.''
   _ A Florham Park, N.J., housewife said she had lost $50,000
invested in stocks, commenting, ``Even if I were in a financial
position to invest now, I would never put my money anywhere but in
the bank. I could never have faith in brokers again.''
   _ A retiree in Cape Gable, Fla., said he had lost ``basically
everything'' and had been forced to go back to work ``to earn
enough to live on.''
   _ A New York City public relations man wrote, ``This continues
to be one of the most painful situations I've ever experienced _ to
have lost so much money, which was hard-earned and difficult to
save, and to feel that I have nowhere to go for help and don't know
how to rectify the problem or recoup the loss.''
   Not all investors had complaints. A Port Orange, Fla., man said
his discount brokerage house had returned $6,500 to him to cover
the full amount of loss because his sell order on Oct. 20, 1987,
had been mishandled.
   The survey was based on responses to questionnaires mailed to
2,500 callers selected at random from 15,000 investors who have
used a hotline set up following the crash by the NASAA. A total of
829 investors returned the mailed surveys.

<HEAD>Griffin To Earlier Merger Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merv Griffin's organization said today it had
given itself an option to drop its bid for Resorts International
Inc., a move that could give it leverage to lower its takeover
offer.
   ``We have not made any decision that we're going to terminate.
On the other hand, we're not giving them any assurance that the
deal is going to go forward,'' said Thomas Gallagher, a spokesman
for Griffin Co.
   Griffin is offering $36 a share for Resorts, which owns Resorts
International Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J., and vast real
estate holdings there, as well as a casino and property in the
Bahamas.
   Under his plan, Griffin would take the company private by buying
out all the stock, including that held by billionaire developer
Donald Trump.
   Griffin's latest move could be a signal that the millionaire and
former talk-show host believes he can get Resorts at a lower price
by threatening to withdraw from the deal altogether.
   Griffin's acquisition depends on several conditions, including
approvals by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and
authorities in the Bahamas.
   One key approval was granted last week by the Internal Revenue
Service. The Casino Control Commission was scheduled to vote
Tuesday regarding Griffin's eligibility to hold a casino license in
New Jersey.
   The latest deadline for completion of the acquisition was
allowed to expire last Friday without extension. Griffin said that
means that any party to the deal is free to terminate its
obligations at any time.
   In a separate matter, Griffin's organization said it had decided
that if it does complete the acquisition, it will be by means of a
merger rather than a tender offer. The amount paid to shareholders,
$36 a share in cash, is not affected by the decision.
   A merger offer was approved on Aug. 30 by the requisite number
of shareholders, Griffin said.
   The proposal calls for Griffin to pay Trump $135 a share, or $96
million, for Trump's Class B stock. Trump also would receive
another $63 million from Griffin to break Trump's management
agreement with Resorts.
   Griffin's tender offer for holders of Class A stock would cost
him $205.2 million. Griffin would also invest $50 million in
Resorts to help it generate enough cash flow to cover interest
payments on Resorts' debt.
   In turn, Trump would pay Resorts $273 million for the
unfinished, 1,250-room Taj Mahal Casino, which is next door to the
Resorts International Casino Hotel and is owned by Resorts.

<HEAD>Xerography, At 50, Father of Copier Revolution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Go into any business and look past the
desks, the computers, the file cabinets, the telephones and chances
are you'll find a copier.
   It's a machine that's taken for granted now that copiers have
found their way into schools, shopping centers and even homes.
   But it was just 50 years ago _ on Oct. 22, 1938 _ that Chester
F. Carlson, a patent worker, invented the process that's at the
heart of every copier.
   His discovery of xerography, the dry method for making
duplicates, helped give birth to the billion-dollar Xerox Corp.,
now based in Stamford, Conn., and in the process, changed the way
the world communicates.
   ``In the history of mankind, there were very few revolutions in
communications, and they all led to the democratization of the
media. The last big revolution prior to Carlson was Gutenberg's
invention,'' said Paul A. Strassman, a former Xerox vice president
now working as an author, teacher and consultant in New Canaan.
   George White, vice president for research at the University of
Pittsburgh and another former Xerox vice president, agreed that
Carlson's invention was as important as Johannes Gutenberg's
invention of printing with moveable type in the 15th century. But
he said it also enabled all workers to participate in business
communications and established the office supplies business as a
multibillion-dollar market.
   ``It liberated the personal initiatives of everyone in the paper
stream. You didn't have to write a book to distribute your notes.
You could type them up and distribute them by xerography,'' he said.
   This freedom is something that doesn't exist with other office
equipment, including the personal computer, White said. Using a
copier requires no training, little expense and time, and works in
all languages. This is particularly important in such countries as
Japan, where copiers are immensely important, because of the
complexity of their written language, he said.
   ``It is probably culturally unbiased more than anything else you
can think of,'' White said.
   Dataquest Inc., a market research firm in San Jose Calif.,
estimates that more than 4.8 million copiers were in use in the
United States last year. Combined, the machines produced an
estimated 490 billion copies and generated revenues in excess of
$15 billion, according to Dataquest.
   What makes the numbers truly astounding is that the first
easy-to-use office copier wasn't marketed until 1960, when Xerox
introduced its famous 914 model. The machine's name was derived
from the fact that it produced a copy as large as 9 inches by 14
inches.
   In between 1938 and 1960, millions of dollars and countless
hours were spent by Carlson and hundreds of other scientists to
make his invention accessible to everyone.
   But the story of xerography actually began while Carlson worked
in the patent office of the P.R. Mallory & Co. in New York City.
Because of legal requirements, numerous copies of patents had to be
made, often by hand. Carlson, who suffered from arthritis,
determined there had to be a better way.
   With a physics degree from the California Institute of
Technology, Carlson began researching scientific literature at the
New York Public Library. This led to experiments at a laboratory he
built and financed out of his own pocket.
   The experiments consisted of putting an electrostatic charge
into metal plates, and then exposing the plates to light. In this
manner, he was able to create patterns that could be used in
printing.
   On Oct. 22, 1938, at his laboratory in Astoria, N.Y., he
produced his first successful duplicate using this process. The
first words reproduced through xerography said simply, ``10-22-38
ASTORIA.''
   Carlson knew he had made a discovery of immense importance, but
he couldn't find a company interested in developing his invention.
More than 20 companies, including General Electric and RCA,
rejected his invention as insignificant.
   Six years after his discovery, he mentioned his invention to Dr.
Russell W. Dayton of the Battelle Memorial Institute, then a small
research organization in Columbus, Ohio. Battelle asked to see the
process and then agreed to undertake its development.
   Among those who worked on developing xerography was Paul Andrus,
who joined Battelle in 1947 shortly after graduating from the
University of Wisconsin. Andrus, who still works at Battelle, went
on to earn 15 patents in the xerography field.
   ``I can remember the first day I saw the process, in a fairly
crude form, and I thought this is really an interesting process. A
person can really get his hands on it and understand the physics of
it. I was impressed,'' Andrus said.
   But, Andrus said, no one working on xerography had any
indication that it would become a process of such tremendous
significance. He recalled that his boss speculated Battelle might
someday need one copier to satisfy its needs.
   Over the years, Battelle's share in xerography profits has
provided the organization with about $300 million, said Douglas E.
Olesen, Battelle president and chief executive officer.
   ``It was the major milestone in our history by any measurement,
financial or technical,'' Olesen said. ``It did more than anything
to establish Battelle as an organization that could put technology
to work.''
   But Battelle couldn't develop xerography alone. In 1946,
Battelle realized it needed additional financing to make Carlson's
invention practical. A year later, it signed an agreement with a
small Rochester, N.Y., company known as Haloid Co.
   Battelle and Haloid, working together, unveiled their first
copier in 1948. But it required 14 complex steps to operate, and it
was not enthusiastically received by businesses. Still, the
machine, known as the OxBox, or the Model A, eventually did fill a
need in the offset printing business.
   Encouraged by this limited success, Battelle and Haloid
continued to work on the machine, with Haloid eventually assuming
the bulk of the scientific, as well as manufacturing
responsibilities. The first machine was improved again and again
through subsequent models, until 1960, when the 914 was introduced.
   Following the success of that copier, the Haloid company
formally changed its name to the Xerox Corp. It had spent $60
million and obtained more than 200 patents in advancing xerography
from Carlson's crude invention to a truly automatic machine.

<HEAD>Stalled Project: What's Good for General Motors Is Not Good for
Egypt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEJLA SAMMAKIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp.'s ambitious Egyptian
compact car project, brought in with a bang 2{ years ago, has crept
out with a whimper.
   While GM says it expects the project to be revived, Egyptian
officials appear convinced that the whole idea is a thing of the
past.
   ``At this point we are waiting for the Egyptians to take a step,
to give an indication which way they are about to proceed,'' said
John Pekerek of GM's international public relations office in
Detroit.
   ``We've indicated to the government our presence and our
(continuing) interest.''
   Egyptian officials, on the other hand, say they've heard nothing
of the project since its kickoff in 1986.
   GM announced the project in June of that year, for the creation
of General Misr Co., a joint venture with the government's el-Nasr
Automotive Co.
   General Misr was to build and market Opel Corsa compacts and
mid-sized Opel Asconas with production to begin by mid-1987,
according to the GM plan. Additionally, the plan envisioned the
manufacture of auto parts for export to markets in the Middle East
and to Opel headquarters in West Germany.
   The announcement was accompanied by a lavish reception for press
and officials to celebrate the occasion.
   But by May 1987, el-Nasr Automotive had decided, with little
fanfare, to pull out. The decision followed ``a setback from there
(Detroit), for internal GM reasons,'' Ezzeldine Heikal, el-Nasr's
president, told The Associated Press.
   He refused to elaborate on the setback or the reasons, except to
say that ``the founders-to-be decided the subject was not economic.
We decided to end it. It is finished.''
   As a result, Egypt's compact car industry lost a proposed loan
from the U.S. Agency for International Development of $30 million
to $35 million that had been earmarked for the project.
   An American source said since the merger never took off and
there was no formal request for the loan, money never was allocated.
   In Detroit, GM officers acknowledged el-Nasr's withdrawal and
say the giant company has found no substitute. But they said GM has
not written off the project and remains optimistic.
   The chairman of Egypt's General Authority for Investment,
Mohieddin Ghareeb, said his office gave the go-ahead but he
understood that problems cropped up between the two parties.
   ``The project ended,'' Ghareeb said, and since then, ``nobody
has presented anything to us.''
   Ostensibly a private organization, Ghareeb's agency gives or
withholds the green light for private-sector projects in
consultation with a variety of ministries including labor, industry
and agriculture.
   ``It's been two years since we talked about the GM Opel car,''
said Yousef Mazhar, undersecretary of state at the Industry
Ministry. ``They (GM) have not pursued their first interest in
passenger cars. Studies they put together showed it would be highly
priced.''
   Western diplomats agreed that the ``price issue was at the
center'' of the misunderstanding between the two sides but also
were hopeful for an eventual rebirth of the project.
   ``The two sides have different expectations of what the market
can handle,'' said a diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``That deal as originally thought through is not going to work
... for a number of reasons. The price issue is at the center of
it,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, he warned: ``Be careful. Don't write the GM
project off. The GM relationship with Egypt is not over.''
   GM has shared a long past with Egypt. It began with a busy
assembly plant in Alexandria on the Mediterranean coast, which was
nationalized with scores of other industries by the late President
Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1961.
   The American automaking giant made a comeback in the early
1980s, after Egypt moved away from Nasser's socialism to welcome
private foreign investment again, and set up a truck manufacturing
plant on the outskirts of Cairo.
   The 1986 announcement of the compact-car project said GM would
provide 30 percent of the new company's capital. The rest was to be
held by Egyptian investors including el-Nasr, wholly owned by the
government. The project's estimated cost was to have been $171
million.
   Detroit said the new venture would have ``complemented'' General
Motors Egypt, a joint-venture company manufacturing and
distributing commercial vehicles here since 1984.
   Initially, 52 percent of the components of the compact cars
would have been made in Egypt, with plans to increase that
percentage to 80 percent in 10 years.
   Mohamed Razzaq, the Pakistani-born general manager for GM Egypt,
refused to discuss the stalemate in the compact-car project or
answer questions about it.
   The demand for cars in Egypt totals about 40,000 to 60,000 a
year. El-Nasr imports automobile parts, mostly from Italy's Fiat,
and combines them with locally made parts to manufacture a
family-sized car and two smaller models.

<HEAD>Soybeans Open Higher, Grains Lower On Harvest Estimate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures opened slightly higher while
grain futures opened mostly lower today on the Chicago Board of
Trade in reaction to new production estimates by a respected
private analyst.
   The Chicago-based analyst, Conrad Leslie, pegged 1988 U.S.
soybean production at 1.48 billion bushels and predicted a corn
harvest of 4.55 billion bushels.
   Leslie released his influential estimates ahead of the
Agriculture Department's production estimates, which will be
released Wednesday afternoon.
   Both of Leslie's numbers were higher than the USDA's September
estimates of 1.47 billion bushels of soybeans and 4.46 billion
bushels of corn. But analysts said Leslie's soybean number was
lower than traders had expected and it prompted some buying of
soybean futures.
   Leslie's corn production number was higher than expected and
sparked some selling of corn futures, analysts said.
   Selling linked to the advancing corn and soybean harvest also
weighed on the market, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 1{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.33 a bushel; corn was 1
cent lower to 1{ cents higher with December at $2.93{ a bushel;
oats were 2{ cents to 4} cents higher with December at $2.49 a
bushel; soybeans were 2} cents to 5 cents higher with November at
$7.93 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were mostly higher
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .17 cent lower to .35 cent higher with October
at 72.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .13
cent higher with October at 82.20 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent
lower to .23 cent higher with October at 40.50 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .38 cent to .70 cent higher with February
at 47.90 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Friday.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tenneco Inc. announced today it has entered into
definitive contracts with several buyers for the sale of almost all
of its oil and gas businesses and that it expects the transactions
to gross more than $7.3 billion.
   Tenneco did not name the buyers. However, Mesa Limited
Partnership, controlled by Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens, announced
it has agreed to buy Tenneco's oil and gas production in its
mid-continent division for $715 million in cash.
   In addition, Seagull Energy Corp. announced today it had signed
letters of intent to buy Tenneco's Houston Oil & Minerals Corp. for
$16.4 million.
   It was also announced today that Seagull has agreed to buy the
assets of the Houston Oil Trust for $35.3 million and Houston Oil
Royalty Trust for $4.5 million in separate transactions.
   Negotiations are continuing for certain minor portions of
Tenneco's oil and gas segment, but the company said it expects
total gross proceeds from the sales to exceed the $7.3 billion
mark, according to a statement released today.
   Although the Houston-based company did not disclose any details
about the agreements, it said more information would be released
Tuesday following a board meeting.
   Tenneco, the nation's 10th largest oil company, had previously
said it expects all of the transactions to be closed by the end of
the year.
   The company announced in May it was getting out of the petroleum
exploration and production business, which represents about 20
percent of its assets, and would concentrate on its pipeline and
other industrial businesses7.
   When Tenneco made the announcement, it said proceeds would be
used to help pay its hefty $8.5 billion debt. Analysts have
estimated that the sale could fetch between $5 billion and $7
billion.

<HEAD>Paperworkers Union To End 16-Month Strike In Maine</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS last 2 grafs with 11 grafs to add comment from mill
spokesman, union workers; other detail. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GLENN ADAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JAY, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sometimes violent strike by 2,300
paperworkers who walked out at International Paper Co. mills here
and in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania is ending after 16 months, union
officials said today.
   ``The strike is over,'' said John Chouinard, spokesman for Local
14 of the United Paperworkers International Union.
   The decision was reached Sunday after a series of meetings with
union leaders from IP mills across the country, said Robert Frase,
executive assistant to UPIU president Wayne Glenn in Nashville,
Tenn.
   The company was informed by telegram Sunday, he said.
   International Paper had continued to run its mills with
replacement workers. It boasted that production was nearly at
pre-strike levels, and insisted the non-union employees are there
to stay.
   Elections are pending to decertify the UPIU and the
International Brotherhood of Firemen and Oilers as bargaining
agents for mill employees. Once the strike was a year old, only the
replacement workers were eligible to vote.
   A small number of Firemen and Oilers are included in the
decision to end the strike.
   Frase said ending the strike was a strategic move that will
force IP to rehire strikers when openings occur.
   ``The decision was made by the rank and file, by their elected
leaders,'' he said.
   ``No one twisted their arms or put a gun to their heads,'' Frase
said.
   More than 1,200 members of the UPIU and the IBFO walked out in
Jay in June 1987 in a contract dispute over premium pay for work on
Sundays and holidays and IP's demand for looser work rules. The
company has continued to run the mill with non-union replacement
workers.
   Since the walkout began, this once-sleepy western Maine town has
seen boisterous rallies and marches and a court order to curb
name-calling, vandalism and occasional violence on the picket lines.
   Mill spokesman Richard White said today that IP intends to keep
the replacements and said the mill was currently ``at full
complement.'' Still, he acknowledged that strikers will now be
legally entitled to first preference for any job openings, which he
said occur at average of three per week.
   ``As openings occur, we will welcome workers who have been on
strike who qualify for those openings,'' he said.
   The mood was somber this morning at union headquarters, where a
sign out front urged the strikers to ``Stand Tall. We Will All Go
Back Together.'' Inside, scores of union members milled about.
   ``It's not that we don't want to fight _ it's just that we
can't. We have nothing to fight with,'' said one striker, Roland
Samson.
   Felix Jacques, executive vice president of the local, said UPIU
lawyers would explain the implications of the action in detail at a
union meeting in Jay on Wednesday night but that essentially it
would entitle the strikers to any jobs that become available at the
mill.
   ``By law, they cannot hire any permanent replacements as of
today,'' Jacques said.
   Frase maintained that the walkouts at the Jay mill, as well as
at IP mills in Depere, Wis., and Lock Haven, Pa., had successfully
sent IP and other paper companies the message that such disputes
are `'something that's not going to be won easily.'' However, he
refused to concede defeat for the union.
   ``Just because the strike is over doesn't mean the conflict has
ended,'' he said.
   The paperworkers union had sought to consolidate the strikes at
the three mills, as well as a lockout at the IP mill in Mobile,
Ala., where today's action by the union has no direct impact.

   The number of working oil and gas rigs dropped by
four this week to total 914, Bker Hughes Inc. reports.
   Last week, the rig count increased by one to 918. A year ago,
the count totaled 1,104, Baker Hughes announced Monday.
   Baker Hughes' rig count, the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.
   Among major oil producing states, Texas and Kansas each had
seven fewer working rigs. Michigan lost four, Ohio was down by
three and Wyoming's count slipped by one.
   Colorado had six more working rigs, New Mexico gained five,
Louisiana was up by four and California got three more rigs. North
Dakota's count was up one.

<HEAD>Gaming Analysts Keeping An Eye on Wynn's Move</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gaming analysts are keeping an eye on Golden
Nugget Inc. Chairman Steve Wynn's latest move, the purchase of the
troubled Claridge Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City.
   Wynn announced the purchase last Monday, saying Las Vegas-based
Golden Nugget will buy the property for $110 million if the sale is
approved by the hotel's management groups and New Jersey gaming
regulators.
   The Claridge property lost $78.8 million last year.
   Daniel Lee, a gaming industry analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., a New York-based investment firm, said Wynn has the potential
to turn the Claridge into one of the more profitable casinos in
Atlantic City.
   ``This is the chance for Steve Wynn to prove himself as a
genius,'' Lee said. ``He has always talked about the Golden
Nugget's marketing. Now, the Claridge gives him the perfect place
to prove himself right.''
   Marvin Roffman, a gaming analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in
Philadelphia, said Wynn will offer a challenge to Atlantic City's
11 other resorts.
   Because the purchase price is relatively low, Wynn's overhead
will be such that he can offer favorable odds to the gambler,
Roffman said.
   ``Steve Wynn, in my opinion, is the most creative marketing man
I've ever seen in the casino business,'' Roffman said.
   Wynn sold his Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City to
Bally Manufacturing Co. 20 months ago for $440 million. He retained
25 acres of land in the city for a possible return to gaming in New
Jersey.
   But the purchase of the Claridge came as a surprise.
   The move came two days after Wynn took control of the Nevada
Club casino in Laughlin, Nev. He bought the casino for $40 million
from Del Webb, the same company that owns the Claridge.
   Wynn's 3,200-room, $550 million Golden Nugget on the Las Vegas
Strip is scheduled to open late next year.
   Standard & Poor's issued a news release last week following
Wynn's Claridge announcement, saying Wynn's marketing skills would
be challenged by the loss-riddled Atlantic City property.

<HEAD>The Decline and Fall of America? Myth or Reality</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is America really in decline economically?
   The issue is usually posed as a question, because the plain
truth is that nobody really knows, even those who have written
profound tomes on the subject, and by reason of having done so
claim the designation ``expert.''
   The New York Times magazine and Newsweek in cover stories this
year asked ``Is America In Decline?'' U.S. News & World Report
phrased it diffently, asking: ``Are We Losing It?'' All major news
magazines have run similar stories.
   While the question is the most pervasive that can be tackled by
the political candidates, they seldom take more than a jab at it _
usually in reference to trade and budget deficits _ rarely treating
it as a whole.
   Scholarly tomes have not been totally convincing. And popular
texts, such as that written by Ravi Batra about the great
depression supposedly to come in 1990, have been so bludgeoned by
critics that they their credibility quickly wanes.
   Nevertheless, the doubts generated by the questions and the
evasions, and by the very fact that they are being asked, have left
I iidespread feeling that the great minds of American economics are
pessimistic about the future.
   Well, not" ...
  ...   fact, many highly respected economists believe
that the entire gloomy thesis has been overstated and seldom
documented and that popular and academic thinking alike mightb{
caught in a rut.
  *Jfmes Griffen, economist at Ae\n  Life & Casualty, is one.
Edward Yardeni of Prudential-Bache Securities is another.
   Each has been concerned enough to examine the thesis not just by
the current evidence but through history, too. Each believes that
analysts are misleading themselves by viewing events through dated
perspectives.
   Says Griffen: Though enthusiastically publicized, the story is
now being undercut by events, ``leading to its own decline and
ultim!u demise. Good riddance.''
   And Yardeni: ``The pessimists do play a very important role in
our society by identifying the problems. But they tend to
exaggerate: The forces of darkness always seem to be superior to
the forces of light.''
   The case for American decline is narrowly based, says Griffen,
who offers this insight into the trade deficit, often viewed as
Amexidan weakness:
   ``At its core is a misperception of the implications of
globalization. Much lip service is paid these days to the idea of
one world economy, but many commentators then reason within an
essentially nationalist framework.''
   In his view, critics portray the trade deficit as a case of
shoddy American goods getting bested in economic competition by the
higher quality, higher value products of rising nations. The
deficit becomes an emblem of decline.
   But, he says, ``a cooler and more broadly based version of these
events is that the American deficits of the 1980s provided a
Keynesian fiscal boost to a global econom|`jn danger of pitching
into the abyss.
   ``Far from supporting the case for decline, the twin deficits of
this decade will be seen by future historians as the bold
initiative of U.S. policy which, in the formative years of the
global economy, substantially cuhioned the Great Depression of the
1980s.
   Argues Griffen: ``When others shrank from leadership, the United
States accepted a disproportionate share of the burden.''
   Yardeni's optimistic view of current events and future
possibilities is so detailed that it has evolved into an entire
econ/lc framework called ``New Wave Economics.''
   New Wave economics rejects many of the old business-cycle
frameworks _ such as monetarism and supply-side economics _ as too
rigid and dogmatic, often irrelvant to modern events, ``and
downright useless at other times.''
   An example: Powerful demographic forces related to the aging of
the baby boom, often unexamined by others, should push personal
savings toward 10 percent and the unemployment rate down to 4
percent within the next five years.
   The baby boomers' savings will help finance government and
industry. They will help keep interest rates down. And as they come
into their own, the baby boomers will become more productive,
rather than a drain on the economy.
   In his view, capitalism has never been more dynamic, and
eventually wil,!

<HEAD>Cafeteria Chain Sues Grocery Stores over Recipes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Furr's-Bishop's Cafeterias L.P. has filed
a $65 million lawsuit against Furr's Inc., a grocery chain,
claiming it stole top-secret recipes.
   The cafeteria company alleges Furr's Inc. has appropriated and
used Furr's-Bishop's recipes for preparation and sale of its food
items.
   The suit filed Friday in state district court here names Furr's
Inc., members of its management and two former Furr's-Bishop's
employees, Joe Sherwood and Rowena Johnson, who now work for the
grocery store chain.
   Furr's-Bishop's alleges that Sherwood and Johnson obtained major
portions of the company's recipe books and took the recipes with
them when they were hired by Furr's Inc.
   The cafeteria company accuses the two of disclosing the
information when Furr's Inc. opened several cafeterias in San
Angelo and Amarillo.
   In addition to monetary damages, Furr's-Bishop's also seeks a
court ruling prohibiting Furr's Inc. from continuing to use the
recipes, which the cafeteria company claims are valuable trade
secrets.
   Both companies are based in Lubbock.
   Furr's-Bishop's operates 154 restaurants in 17 states and is the
second-largest cafeteria operator in the country.
   Furr's Inc. has 154 stores in New Mexico and Texas and had about
$150 million in sales in 1987.
   The two companies began as part of the same family-owned
enterprise, which was later split into cafeteria and grocery store
companies. Both entities were eventually bought by outsiders, the
grocery stores by a West German investment group and the cafeterias
by K mart Corp.
   Furr's-Bishop's Cafeterias L.P. was formed after investor
Michael Levenson purchased the chain from K mart.

<HEAD>Holders of TWA Preferred Stock Agree To Give Up Voting Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines Inc. said Monday that most
holders of TWA preferred stock have agreed to give up their voting
rights, clearing another obstacle to Chairman Carl C. Icahn's plan
to take the airline private.
   TWA said it expected the privatization to be completed about
Oct. 24.
   The airline said around 83 percent of the holders of its
remaining class of preferred shares who cast ballots consented to
Icahn's proposal to eliminate their right to vote in elections of
TWA directors. Last month, the other TWA preferred issues were
converted into 12 percent notes due in 2008.
   ``This was the last major procedural block'' related to TWA's
capital structure that remained in the way of the privatization
plan, said Mark Buckstein, senior vice president and general
counsel for the airline.
   Other roadblocks remain, however. The union representing TWA
flight attendants has asked the Department of Transportation to
block the privatization and freeze the airline's assets while it
investigates Icahn's fitness to continue managing TWA.
   The Consumer Federation of America has filed a similar petition.
   And a lawsuit filed by the TWA pilots union alleges that Icahn's
plan to go private is a breach of the agreements the union made
with him during his takeover of the carrier.
   The battle between Icahn and TWA's unions spilled over into
Congress late last month, as lawmakers dueled over whether a House
subcommittee should scrutinize the dispute.
   Icahn, an aggressive bidder for corporations, reportedly has had
recent discussions with Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo
about acquiring ailing Eastern Airlines from Texas Air.
   The TWA chairman, who now owns around 77 percent of TWA's 30.5
million common shares outstanding, won approval from shareholders
in early September for his privatization plan.
   Under the plan, Icahn and the financial entities controlled by
him would own about 90 percent of TWA's stock, while the remaining
shares would be held by an employee stock ownership plan.
   Airline industry analysts estimate the bid puts a value of
around $40 a share, or $304.8 million, on the TWA shares that Icahn
does not already own.
   Shareholders not affiliated with Icahn would receive for each
share of common stock $20 in cash and $30 in face amount of the 12
percent notes due 2008. Holders of the remaining class of preferred
stock would receive 25 cents a share.

<HEAD>Panel Calls SEC Lax In Investigating Suspicious Foreign Trades</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has
failed to investigate most reports of suspicious foreign trading of
U.S. securities, despite a growing number of illegal trades
originating from abroad, a House panel said Monday.
   A report by the Government Operations Committee said the SEC had
actively investigated only 61 of 229 reports from stock exchanges
of suspicious foreign trades _ mostly those appearing to involve
insider trading _ in 1986 and 1987.
   The report was based on a year-long investigation by the panel's
subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs.
   The 168 incidents not investigated by the SEC, the subcommittee
said, involved 503 foreign individuals, banks or other entities in
25 countries and represented gross potential profits for the
foreign investors of at least $38.1 million.
   ``When fraudulent trading from abroad is not comprehensively
investigated and prosecuted, the integrity of U.S. equity markets
is threatened, all investors are put at risk and a tougher standard
of prosecution for domestic traders is created,'' the House report
said.
   The director of the SEC's enforcement division, Gary G. Lynch,
said Monday he had not seen the report's final draft, but that in
testimony before the panel last June the commission had taken issue
with the way the probe was being conducted.
   ``We at that time pointed out the problems we saw in the
methodology that they employed,'' Lynch said.
   He said the House subcommittee investigators had underreported
the number of SEC staffers working on cases involving foreign
purchases and sales of U.S. securities, and that the report was
based on an incorrect assumption that all trading activity brought
to the SEC's attention automatically warranted a federal
investigation.
   Lynch said many trades _ by domestic and foreign investors alike
_ are reported to the SEC as ``suspicious'' because they are
executed near the time of a major price move on a securties
exchange. Most of these trades, he said, are legitimate.
   Besides cases of potential insider trading, the House report
said the ``suspicious'' trades referred to the SEC included
possible sales of unregistered securities and unspecified other
acts of market manipulation.
   The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., found
that the dollar volume of U.S. securities bought and sold by
foreigners increased from $25.6 billion in 1977 to $277.5 billion
in 1986. Last year it leaped to $481.9 billion.
   It said expert testimony before the panel last summer indicated
that the number of illegal trades also had grown in recent years,
although the report gave no figures on this.
   Foreign transactions accounted for 18 percent of the total
dollar value of all U.S. equity market transactions last year, the
subcommittee said, but they represented more than 30 percent of the
suspicious trades reported to the SEC by stock exchanges.
   The report blamed the SEC's failure to investigate more
suspicious foreign trades on a shortage of enforcement staff, a
lack of bilateral agreements with other countries to share
information on securities trades, the existence of bank secrecy
laws in many countries and delays by the stock exchanges in
reporting suspicious trades to the SEC.
   In response to the subcommittee investigation, the report said
the SEC promised to assign more people to its international
enforcement activities and give them more responsibility to pursue
new bilateral information-sharing agreements and to renegotiate and
expand the scope of existing bilateral agreements.
   The House report said these changes would be inadequate to
correct the enforcement problem.
   Only six countries _ Switzerland, Britain, Japan, Canada, the
Netherlands and Italy _ have bilateral information-sharing
agreements with the United States, the report said, and the SEC
rarely pursues suspicious trades originating from other countries.
   During 1987, the report said, about $141 billion in securities
transactions in American equity markets originated in foreign
countries and were not subject to any formal information-sharing
arrangement with the SEC.
   The report recommended Congress enact legislation prohibiting
trades in U.S. securities that originate in countries that have
banking secrecy laws or that refuse to enter into bilateral
information-sharing agreements on securities matters.
   It also recommended Congress give the SEC more money to step up
enforcement efforts.

<TEXT>
   Share prices finished an uneventful session
slightly lower Monday, as the market awaited a series of economic
reports due later in the week.
   Dealers said some of the market's enthusiasm of past weeks was
sapped by weekend statements by British Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson, who indicated that interest rates would likely remain
high over the near term to wring inflationary pressures from the
British economy.
   Lawson's remarks ``stopped last week's rise dead in its
tracks,'' said one market maker.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished off
0.6 point, or 0.03 percent, at 1,844.1, slightly above its worst
level for the day of 1,844.0. The index hit its session high of
1,852.2 at mid-morning.
   Of the 100-share index's stocks, 44 were lower, 36 were higher
and 20 were unchanged.
   Volume was light, as just 423.6 million shares changed hands,
compared with the 583.7 million shares Friday.
   Activity was subdued ahead of the economic reports due out later
this week, dealers said. Among these will be Thursday's release of
U.S. trade figures for August. In Britain, retail price figures
were due Friday.

   Soybean futures prices closed higher, wheat
finished lower and corn futures closed mixed Monday on the Chicago
Board of Trade, reflecting differing opinions about the size of the
nation's corn and soybean crops.
   The Agriculture Department will release its updated crop
production estimates Wednesday afternoon. Trading activity ahead of
the report typically revolves around speculation about the
government report.
   Traders generally expect the government to increase its
production estimates from last month's predictions of 1.47 billion
bushels of soybeans and 4.46 billion bushels of corn, analysts said.
   Higher numbers are expected because with the harvest about half
finished, farmers are reporting better yields than most experts had
projected, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   On Monday, the respected Chicago-based crop analyst Conrad
Leslie pegged 1988 U.S. soybean production at 1.48 billion bushels
and predicted a corn harvest of 4.55 billion bushels.
   The predictions prompted some buying of soybean futures and
selling of corn futures, Lespinasse said. But in general, he added,
``we're all just marking time, waiting for Wednesday.''
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 7\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.27{ a bushel; corn was 2
cents lower to 2\ cents higher with December at $2.92{ a bushel;
oats were 2{ cents to 4{ cents higher with December at $2.47 a
bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 6 cents higher with November at
$7.93 a bushel.

   The stock market showed no clear trend today in
a quiet Columbus Day session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 42.50 on Friday,
rose another 8.36 to 2,158.61 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   But losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 650 up, 704 down and
518 unchanged.
   Stocks had trouble extending Friday's strong rally in the
absence of many investors who were taking Columbus Day off.
   The market for government securities, which sets the tone for
interest rates, did not operate today.
   Still, analysts said traders were heartened by the news on
Friday of smaller-than-expected employment growth in September.
   The resulting rally in the bond and stock prices carried
stock-market indicators near or, in some cases, past the levels
they reached in early July, which marked their peaks since the
crash a year ago.
   Best Products led the active list, up 5~ at 26|. The company

   Pinnacle West tumbled 3~ to 19. The company's chairman said

<HEAD>Credit Suisse-First Boston and First Boston Corp. to Merge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Boston Corp., faced with increasing
competition from its sister company, Financiere Credit Suisse-First
Boston, will merge with the London-based firm in a $1.1 billion
deal.
   The merger, approved by First Boston's board and announced on
Sunday, follows six months of negotiations.
   ``The new structure will help the two organizations overcome
strains that have developed in their relationship because of the
far-reaching changes in the global marketplace,'' the firms said in
a statement.
   The combined entity, which will be privately held, is to be
called CS First Boston Inc. and headquartered here. The merger will
involve buying out First Boston's existing public shareholders at
$52.50 a share in cash, a total buyout cost of $1.1 billion.
   The Swiss banking conglomerate Credit Suisse will own 44.5
percent of the combined new entity, giving it effective control and
the largest foreign stake in a major Wall Street securities house.
   Credit Suisse will also become the only commercial banking
concern to control a major securities house. Banks are prohibited
in the United States from holding such large stakes in securities
firms, as a provision to separate commercial banking and securities
underwriting activities.
   First Boston and Credit Suisse created Financiere Credit
Suisse-First Boston as a joint venture, in 1978.
   Credit Suisse, among Europe's largest banking companies with
almost $68 billion in assets at the end of last year, is able to
take the stake because it held its interest before the law against
such holdings took effect. Staff at the Federal Reserve approved
the arrangement last week, The New York Times reported Monday.
   The merger of the two firms, both among the world's largest
providers of financial services, is part of a trend toward partial
foreign ownership of top U.S. investment houses.
   Peter T. Buchanan, First Boston's chief executive, said the firm
is negotiating to bring in other foreign investors to purchase 30.5
percent of the new entity.
   Buchanan indicated that the additional investors would be from
Japan or elsewhere in the Pacific Basin to give the firm better
contacts in that market.
   Until other investors are found, the 30.5 percent stake will be
bought and held by a friendly investor, First Boston said.
   In an unusual step, the firm refused to name the friendly
investor. It said it would be identified before the merger is
completed.
   First Boston has suffered several setbacks in the last two
years, including the departure in February of its two best
deal-makers, Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella. The men left to
form their own investment bank.
   Among other troubles, the firm had a loss of about $100 million
in trading risky options on Treasury bonds in the summer of 1987
and had another $50 million loss in trading mortgage-backed
securities. Its mortgage securities chief, its head of municipal
finance, its head of risk arbitrage, seven members of its leveraged
buy-out group and several others either left or were asked to
leave, the Wall Street Journal said.
   The merger will shake up senior management. Credit Suisse
chairman Rainer Gut, 55, who has been outspoken in his displeasure
with aspects of First Boston's performance, will become chairman of
CS First Boston upon completion of the transaction.
   Buchanan will become chief executive of CS First Boston but only
until the fall of 1989, when he will retire at age 55, following
through on an existing plan.
   Buchanan will be succeeded next year by John M. Hennessey, a
former First Boston official who has been chairman of Credit Suisse
First Boston in London. The Wall Street Journal said Hennessey has
the strong support of the Swiss, for whom he has effectively worked.
   First Boston chairman Alvin Shoemaker, 49, whom Buchanan had
previously described as his successor, will instead retire at the
end of the year.

Stake</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African-controlled Minorco SA, which has
offered $3.5 billion for the 70.6 percent of Consolidated Gold
Fields PLC it does not already own, said Monday it would sell
Consolidated's 49.3 percent stake in Newmont Mining Corp. if its
bid were successful.
   The stake of about 33 million Newmont Mining shares was worth
about $1.25 billion at Monday's late-afternoon price of $37.87{ a
share on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Luxembourg-based Minorco, which already owns 29.4 percent of
Consolidated Gold Fields, is controlled by Anglo American Corp. and
De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold and diamond mining
interests of the wealthy Oppenheimer family of South Africa.
   A spokesman for Minorco could not be reached for comment. His
office telephone was answered by an answering machine late Monday.
   Minorco's cash and stock offer currently values the entire
company at $5 billion, or $21.80 a share. Consolidated Gold Fields
shares closed Monday at 12.87 pounds, or about $22 a share, down 16
pence, or 27 cents a share, on London's Stock Exchange.
   Minorco said its decision to sell the stake follows New
York-based Newmont Mining's decision to join Consolidated in asking
President Reagan to block the Minorco bid and Newmont's failure to
take up an offer of direct talks with Minorco. It said it would
sell the stake at the best possible terms.
   Previously, Minorco had said it would negotiate with Newmont
Mining to reduce Consolidated's stake in Newmont Mining.
   Consolidated and Newmont Mining appealed to President Reagan on
Thursday to block the bid, saying it would affect U.S. national
security because of Minorco's South African links.
   Consolidated also has asked the British government to review the
bid because of the South African connection.
   The Pretoria government is also investigating the proposed
acquisition.
   In another development, the government of Papua New Guinea said
Monday it would order Minorco to divest itself of Consolidated Gold
Fields' gold interests there because of its South African
ownership, Consolidated said.
   ``We cannot allow this apartheid regime to benefit from our rich
resources,'' Prime Minister Rabbie Namaliu said in a statement
provided by the London-based gold mining company.
   South Africa's apartheid system has allowed the white minority
to control the government.
   Minorco said when it launched the bid Sept. 21 that it would
sell Consolidated's South African interests to a South African
company.
   Consolidated Chairman Rudolph Agnew said Monday: ``They have
already said they will sell GFSA (the South African interests). Now
they are saying Newmont is available for sale on the best terms
possible. They have been told they will have to divest in Papua New
Guinea. What will be left by the closing date?''

   The dollar tumbled Monday in light trading that
was unusually jumpy because most of the major traders in the United
States and Japan had the day off.
   Gold prices rose, boosted by a jump in oil prices. Republic
National Bank of New York, which traded in spite of a bank holiday,
said gold was bid at $408.75 as of the close of trading at 2:30
p.m. EDT, up from $403.30 an ounce as of Friday at 4 p.m.
   Traders described the dollar's decline as a continuation of the
trend that began Friday, when the Labor Department reported a
smaller-than-expected increase in U.S. non-farm jobs in September.
   Slower economic growth means flat or lower interest rates, which
would make dollar-denominated investments less attractive to
foreign investors.
   Some traders were also concerned that the government's report
due Thursday on the August trade deficit would hurt the dollar.
   But trading was so light Monday that some major traders might
not regard the dollar's drop as a reliable indicator of its
underlying trend, said Jack Adkins, a currency analyst for Refco
Partners Ltd. in Chicago.
   Those trading in the United States were mainly brokerage houses,
other financial firms, and banks that kept their currency-trading
operations open in spite of the holiday.
   Monday's thin trading turned the attention of dealers to the
British pound, which was boosted by a pledge Sunday from Chancellor
of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson to keep interest rates high to curb
inflation.
   In London, the pound rose to $1.7130 from $1.6985 late Friday.
Later in New York, the pound rose to $1.7127 from $1.6980 late
Friday.
   Japan's financial markets were closed for a national holiday. In
London, the dollar was quoted at 132.45 yen. Later in New York, the
dollar fell to 132.18 yen from 133.37 late Friday. In Tokyo on
Friday, the dollar closed at 133.50 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8545 West German marks, down from 1.8629; 1.5745
Swiss francs, down from 1.5812; 1.2070 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2085; and 6.3180 French francs, down from 6.3460.
   No quote was available from Telerate Inc. on the Italian lira,
which closed Friday at 1,388.50 to the dollar.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8550 West German marks, down from 1.8608; 1.5755
Swiss francs, down from 1.5795; 6.3213 French francs, down from
6.3420; 2.0907 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0988; 1,383.26 Italian
lire, down from 1,387.50; and 1.2070 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2116.
   Higher oil prices pushed up gold by raising fears of inflation.
   In Hong Kong, gold bullion rose $3.28 a troy ounce to close at a
bid $409.34 an ounce.
   Gold climbed in London to a late bid price of $407.25 per troy
ounce, compared with late Friday's $403.05. In Zurich, gold rose to
close at a bid $407.00 compared with $404.25 late Friday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $408.60 a troy ounce from $403.20 an ounce Friday.
   Silver bullion prices rose moderately in London where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.37 per troy ounce, up from
Friday's $6.33. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery rose to $6.342 an ounce from $6.325 an ounce Friday.

<HEAD>Saudi Says It Will Stick To OPEC Quota If Others Do</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Oil Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JIDDA, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia reaffirmed Monday it
will adhere to an OPEC oil production quota if other members of the
cartel do, a move clearly aimed at reining in overproduction that
is driving prices down.
   The affirmation was made at the weekly cabinet session chaired
by King Fahd and reported by Information Minister Ali al-Shaer.
   He said Saudi Arabia ``affirms anew its keenness to abide by the
OPEC quota as soon as other members of the organization adhered to
their prescribed quotas.''
   He added that the kingdom also affirmed ``full consolidation''
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ``in this
direction and keenness to preserve cohesion of the organization.''
   Oil industry sources have reported that Saudi Arabia has
recently been producing about 6 million barrels of oil a day, far
above its OPEC quota of 4.343 million barrels.
   Saudi Arabia, the leading member of the 13-nation cartel and the
world's largest oil exporter, indirectly confirmed these reports
when it served notice after last week's Cabinet meeting that it
will not freeze its output while others were violating their quotas.
   The sharply worded statement stressed the Saudis' belief that
adherence to the OPEC quota system was the ``best way to restore
full stability'' on the world oil market.
   The Saudis' stiff statements have triggered speculation that
they might pull out of the cartel it helped found 25 years ago. But
Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer has denied that.
   A glut has pushed down prices by about $6 a barrel from OPEC's
benchmark of $18 a barrel in recent weeks to a two-year low. Prices
rose on Monday.
   Industry sources believe that the Saudis' production increase,
which helped depress prices, was primarily aimed at pressuring OPEC
members who are over-producing to curb their output before the
bi-annual ministerial session Nov. 21 in Vienna. The conference
will review production and pricing problems.
   The respected Middle East Economic Survey, published in Nicosia,
said Monday: ``The purpose of Saudi Arabia's `upside swing' ... is
obviously therapeutic: that is to say it is designed to hasten a
return to OPEC production discipline by advancing the point in time
when the pain factor will be sufficient to break up the logjam of
entrenched antagonistic positions among member governments and pave
the way towards a new agreement.''
   The weekly newsletter noted that efforts to curb over-production
by Iran, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates were also ``elements of
an overall solution.''
   Iran and Iraq, which badly need oil revenue for post-war
reconstruction, are producing more than their quotas.
   Iraq, which has refused to accept an OPEC quota of 1.5 million
barrels a day, is producing an estimated 2.7 million barrels a day
and has said it plans to boost that.
   It initially demanded parity with Iran, which has a quota of
2.36 million barrels a day, but has now made clear it seeks a far
higher level.
   Oil sources said that Iran hiked production for a ``test
period'' in mid-September to around 2.9 million barrels a day
following the gulf war cease-fire Aug. 20.
   But they said Iran's war-damaged oil industry was clearly not
able to sustain that production level and has fallen back to a
daily output of around 2.4 million to 2.5 million barrels.
   Middle East Economic Survey noted that OPEC's prices and
strategy committees will meet Oct. 20, probably in Madrid, to
discuss the crisis.
   It noted that a solution ``will be aided by the fact that the
time has certainly arrived when volume maximization at the expense
of price is totally self-defeating.''
   The newsletter said that a new OPEC production agreement, hiking
the ceiling to an overall 19 million barrels a day, more than 2
million barrels above the current limit, was likely.
   By accommodating members who want higher production, without
cutting other producers' output ceilings, ``this would represent a
cutback of some 2 million barrels a day from current OPEC output,
which now appears to be running somewhere in the region of 21
million barrels a day,'' the newsletter said.

<HEAD>MCI Agrees to Pay Up to $3.3 Million for Unanswered Calls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp. has agreed to refund
as much as $3.3 million to current and former customers who were
billed for long-distance telephone calls that rang but were
unanswered.
   If approved by a Chicago court, the agreement will settle
several class-action lawsuits alleging that MCI improperly billed
customers for long-distance calls that didn't get through.
   Under the agreement, people who were MCI customers from 1978
through 1985 are entitled to a refund or credit of either 21 cents
for every unanswered call the person can show as having been
billed, or 63 cents for each of the eight years the person was an
MCI customer.
   A hearing on approval of the settlement is set for next Jan. 5
in Cook County Circuit Court in Illinois. Details of the agreement
were made public last week.
   Billing for unanswered calls was a problem for other
long-distance companies as well. US Sprint Communications Co.
settled a similar lawsuit in July 1987, agreeing to pay customers
as much as $4.8 million, spokesman Syd Courson said.
   The problems date to the early days of long-distance competition
when new competitors generally got connections with local phone
companies that were inferior to those used by American Telephone &
Telegraph Co.
   This unequal access caused a number of problems, including
insufficient and sometimes false electronic signals that determine
whether a call has been answered. Some companies considered calls
that rang more than a certain number of times or for a certain
length of time to have been answered, and the customer was billed
for the call.
   Now, with about 85 percent of the regional Bell phone companies'
lines converted to offer comparable connections to all
long-distance companies, the problem of unanswered calls has been
nearly eliminated, MCI said.

   Scattered buying of blue chips lifted the Dow
Jones average to a new high since the October 1987 crash in the
stock market Monday.
   But otherwise stocks showed little life in a quiet holiday
session.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 big-name stocks climbed 8.71 to
2,158.96, surpassing the previous post-crash closing peak of
2,158.61 it reached on July 5.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances, however, in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
693 up, 711 down and 504 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 124.66 million
shares, down from 216.39 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 148.43 million shares.
   Stocks had trouble extending Friday's strong rally in the
absence of many investors who were taking Columbus Day off.
   The market for government securities, which sets the tone for
interest rates, did not operate Monday.
   Still, analysts said traders were heartened by the news late
last week of smaller-than-expected employment growth in September.
   The resulting rally in the bond and stock prices carried several
of the broader stock-market indicators past their July highs on
Friday. On Monday the Dow joined them.
   Best Products led the active list, up 6[ at 26~. The company
agreed to be acquired by a New York investment firm for $27.50 a
share.
   Pinnacle West Capital tumbled 3| to 19\. The company's chairman
said Friday that its 1989 earnings probably won't be enough to keep
the dividend at its present level.
   General Electric, which reported a 17 percent increase in its
third-quarter earnings, rose [ to 44[
   Among other actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &
Telegraph gained { to 27; American Express 1\ to 30; McDonald's 1]
to 51, and International Business Machines [ to 116[.
   Precious metals stocks chalked up broad gains as the price of
gold rallied $5.40 an ounce to $408.60 on the Commodity Exchange in
New York, responding in part to higher oil prices.
   ASA Ltd. picked up } to 39{; Newmont Gold 2 to 35~; Battle
Mountain Gold ~ to 15}, and Freeport-McMoRan Gold | to 13\.
   Major oil issues were mixed with fractional price changes.
   Time Inc., which has been caught up lately in speculation about
a possible buyout or other deal, was up 3 at 120{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $1.02 billion, or 0.04
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .15 to 156.95.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose .55 to 319.72, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up .17 at 278.24.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped .18 to 385.49. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 304.09, up .27.

<HEAD>New President Named For Coca-Cola USA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coca-Cola Co. on Monday named Ira C. Herbert
president of its flagship division, Coca-Cola USA, in a move aimed
at increasing its advertising firepower in the cola wars.
   Herbert, executive vice president of the parent company, will
replace Edwin R. Mellett as president of both Coca-Cola USA and the
company's North America Business Sector.
   Mellett, a senior vice president of The Coca-Cola Co., will take
over the new job of president of international post-mix sales,
where he will be in charge of fountain sales outside the United
States.
   ``We are convinced that the key factor to success in the decade
ahead will be the ability to serve, excite and communicate with the
consumer in cooperation with our bottlers and the retail trade,''
said Donald R. Keough, president of The Coca-Cola Co.
   He called Herbert ``our most experienced and senior marketing
executive.''
   PepsiCo Inc., Coca-Cola's chief rival in the soft drink market,
has staged splashy advertising campaigns this year linked to the
America's Cup race and heavyweight boxing, while Coca-Cola's
advertising has been more conventional.
   Emanuel Goldman, a beverage industry analyst for PaineWebber in
San Francisco, said Coca-Cola has not necessarily been upstaged by
the Pepsi campaigns, but he said Herbert's appointment may indicate
a concern about marketing among the company's top management.
   ``You can't really be sure, but I would say the fact that it's
Ike Herbert and not somebody else says something,'' Goldman said.
   Herbert worked for the McCann-Erickson advertising agency before
joining Coca-Cola in 1965. He later was vice president of marketing
for Coca-Cola USA and president and chief executive officer of
Coca-Cola Foods. He became chief operating officer of the parent
company in 1982.
   ``He has a history of doing things well,'' Goldman said.
   Asked if marketing had become a chink in Coca-Cola's armor,
Goldman said, ``We should have all such chinks in our armor.''

<HEAD>Japan Bought $8.96 Billion of U.S. Real Estate in Eight Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese investors bought $8.96 billion in
American real estate in the first eight months of this year, and
Chicago may be displacing Hawaii as the third most popular spot for
Japanese buyers, a new study finds.
   If purchases continue at the present pace, Japanese investment
in U.S. real estate in 1988 should surpass last year's record of
$12.77 billion, according to a study released Monday by Kenneth
Leventhal & Co., a real estate consulting firm.
   The company's third-quarter report, which covers only eight
months because September figures were slow in arriving, found
California attracted the most yen, $2.48 billion worth, followed by
New York state, with $1.5 billion.
   Illinois climbed to third place, with $1.34 billion in Japanese
purchases, primarily of Chicago commercial buildings. Hawaii, which
has consistently placed third in such lists, followed Illinois with
$1.2 billion in Japanese investments in the first eight months of
1988.
   Far behind were Georgia, notching a 438 percent increase to $700
million in Japanese purchases, and Massachusetts, with $458 million.
   Since 1987, when Leventhal began keeping such statistics,
Japanese purchases of U.S. real estate have totaled $35.3 billion.
   Leventhal's figures tend to be higher than similar tallies by
the U.S. Commerce Department, Bank of America and the Salomon
Brothers investment firm. Leventhal counts the total value of a
Japanese-funded development project upon groundbreaking, rather
than in increments as the project is built.
   As in the past, office buildings accounted for the biggest share
of Japanese purchases, followed by hotels, residential property,
mixed use developments, retail buildings, land and golf courses.

<HEAD>Striking Electric Boat Workers to Vote on New Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GROTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking shipyard workers at the Electric
Boat Division of General Dynamics Corp. prepared Monday to vote on
a tentative 4-year contract similar to one rejected two months ago
by union negotiators.
   Joseph Messier, president of the striking Metal Trades Council,
said there were a number of recent developments in the 14-week
strike that put pressure on negotiators to get some 10,000 strikers
back to work.
   ``Not only did we have a (National Labor Relations Board)
complaint to deal with, but we got the Boilermakers International
cutting off their strike benefits, and it just caused a big
problem,'' said Messier, whose Metal Trades Council is an umbrella
organization for 10 unions at Electric Boat.
   ``And people started getting worried about the loss of their
jobs and some of them being finally unable to cope anymore. So, we
were under a lot of pressure to get it settled,'' Messier said.
   Electric Boat, which builds submarines, is a division of St.
Louis-based General Dynamics, a major defense contractor.
   Due to the Columbus Day holiday, Electric Boat was closed Monday
and company officials couldn't be reached for comment.
   A ratification vote on the proposed contract was to be conducted
from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday at the Groton City Municipal
Building, and Messier said he expected the contract to be approved.
   The proposed contract, reached Saturday evening after four days
of negotiations in Washington, D.C., and Connecticut, calls for a 3
percent pay increase and bonuses averaging about $2,250, plus
increased costs to workers for health insurance.
   Before walking off the job July 1, workers had rejected the idea
of lump-sum bonuses in lieu of wage increases. They had insisted on
a 3-year contract with a 5 percent raise in the first year, and 4
percent raises in each of the next two years.

<HEAD>GE Earnings Rise 16 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. said Monday that
its third-quarter profit rose 16 percent mainly as a result of
improved performances in its plastics, financial services and
medical systems divisions.
   The Fairfield-based company said net income for the quarter
ended Sept. 30 totaled $815 million, or 90 cents per share,
compared with $703 million, or 77 cents a share in the year-ago
period.
   As required, GE's 1987 quarterly earnings were restated to
reflect the adoption of new accounting rules. Third-quarter 1988
earnings are up 23 percent over the restated 1987 earnings of $661
million, or 73 cents a share.
   Sales for the third quarter totaled $9.31 billion, down 1
percent from $9.40 billion a year ago.
   However, GE said, adjusting for all acquisitions and
divestitures in 1987, sales for the current quarter were up 7
percent from last year's comparable period.
   The company noted that plastics led the increase in operating
profits in the materials division. Major appliance revenues were up
reflecting the acquisition of Roper Corp., but operating profits
were down because of higher materials costs and competitive pricing
pressures.
   The parent of National Broadcasting Co., GE noted that
broadcasting revenues were up but operating profit slipped because
of increased costs associated with covering the Olympics and the
two major political conventions.
   Chairman John F. Welch Jr. said that while ``improvements were
led by plastics, financial services and medical systems, ... there
were also widespread margin improvements throughout the rest of the
company.''
   For the first nine months, net income totaled $2.38 billion, or
$2.63 a share, up 16 percent from $2.05 billion, or $2.24 a share
in the year-ago period.
   Nine-month revenue totaled $26.53 billion, down 3 percent from
$27.28 billion a year ago but up 4 percent when adjusted for
acquisitions and divestitures.
   GE is a diversified manufacturing services and technology
company. Its products include plastics, medical diagnostic
equipment, aircraft engine and radar equipment, major appliances
and power generation equipment.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Rally As Oil Prices Surge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of gold, platinum and silver surged Monday in
reaction to a bundle of bullish signals including a weaker dollar
and a strong rally in the oil market.
   On other markets, copper futures continued to climb; grains and
soybeans were mixed; livestock and meat futures were mostly lower;
and stock-index futures retreated.
   The gold market has shown vigor since its return last week to
spot prices above $400 a troy ounce. Analysts said prices appear
poised to move even higher than Monday's finish of $408.60 an ounce
for October delivery on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   ``We'll probably get up to $413 or $415 on spot gold,'' said
Richard Levine, vice president of precious metals and currency
trading with Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   But Levine said gold's recovery would depend upon continued
strength in the buoyant platinum market and in crude oil prices.
   He said Monday's gains were largely due to short covering _
stop-loss buying by those who had bet on falling prices.
   Analyst James Steel of Refco Inc. in New York said $400 an ounce
proved to be a strong technical support point for gold once the
metal's price had settled firmly above that level.
   ``Today we built on the relatively modest gains of last week,''
Steel said.
   Like Levine, Steel linked gold's renewed strength to the
dollar's weakness, the oil market's rally and platinum's recovery,
which is based on supply concerns.
   On the Commodity Exchange, gold settled $5.40 to $5.50 higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $412.70 a troy ounce;
silver was 1.5 cents to 1.7 cents higher with December at $6.42 a
troy ounce.
   Platinum settled $8.80 to $10.80 higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with October at $520.40 a troy ounce.
   Copper futures prices continued to climb on the Commodity
Exchange, posting new contract highs for the sixth consecutive day
on fears of tight supply.
   Copper settled 1.85 cents to 3.80 cents higher with October at
$1.28 a pound.
   Oil prices soared on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Analysts
said buying was spurred by Saudi Arabia's statement that it would
abide by its OPEC crude production quota if other members of the
oil cartel would do the same.
   Iraq also indicated its willingness to abide by its production
quota set by the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   OPEC overproduction has been blamed for the persistent weakness
of oil prices.
   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude,
settled 43 cents to 66 cents higher with November at $13.60 a
barrel; heating oil was 1.23 cents to 1.57 cents higher with
November at 38.96 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .70 cent to
1.35 cents higher with November at 41.41 cents a gallon.
   Soybean futures finished higher, wheat settled lower and corn
futures ended mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting
differing opinions about the size of the nation's corn and soybean
crops.
   The Agriculture Department will release its updated crop
production estimates Wednesday afternoon. Trading activity ahead of
such reports typically revolves around speculation about the
government's estimates.
   Traders generally expect the USDA to increase its production
estimates from last month's predictions of 1.47 billion bushels of
soybeans and 4.46 billion bushels of corn.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 7\ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in December at $4.27{ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to
2\ cents higher with December at $2.92} a bushel; oats were 2}
cents to 4{ cents higher with December at $2.47 a bushel; soybeans
were 1} cents to 4} cents higher with November at $7.91} a bushel.
   Most cattle futures declined on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
amid concerns about narrow packer profit margins and weakening
demand for beef, analysts said.
   Hog futures retreated on technical factors and expectations that
hog prices in the spot market would open lower on Tuesday.
   Live cattle settled .53 cent lower to .15 cent higher with
October at 72.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .55
cent lower with October at 81.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .03
cent to .52 cent lower with October at 40.42 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .28 cent lower to .20 cent higher with February
at 47.65 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures declined on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for December delivery on the Standard & Poor's
500 index sttled .55 point lower at 280.30.

<TEXT>
   Tropicana Products Inc. announced Monday
that it has dropped its suit against a former engineer who defected
to competitor Minute Maid, a division of the Coca-Cola Co.
   Tropicana dismissed the 7-month-old suit after learning from
attorneys for Coca-Cola that Richard A. Hamilton's relationship
with Minute Maid was terminated on Oct. 1, Tropicana spokesman
Steve Gold said in a news release.
   Tropicana was notified of Coke's decision Thursday, he said.
   ``We would categorize the whole thing as very unfortunate,''
said Michelle Beale, vice president for public affairs with
Coca-Cola Foods.
   ``We released Mr. Hamilton from employment in October because
Tropicana had received a temporary injunction which restricted him
from practicing his expertise in citrus. We're in the process of
trying to work with him through an outplacement service,'' she
added.
   Suit was filed last March to prevent Hamilton from disclosing
Tropicana's ``trade secrets and secret processes'' to his new
bosses at Coca-Cola.
   Tropicana claimed its 30 percent share of the market hinged on
its pasteurized, fresh-tasting ``Pure Premium'' juice product,
which competitors hadn't been able to duplicate. If Hamilton were
to disclose what he knew to Minute Maid it would cause ``lasting
and irreparable harm to Tropicana,'' the company said in its court
filings.
   The company claimed when Hamilton left he expressed an ``intense
dislike of Tropicana and stated he would `get' the company.''
   A state judge granted Tropicana's request for a temporary
injunction in late March.
   At the time, a Coca-Cola spokeswoman said any attempts to get
proprietary information was against company policy.
   On Oct. 1, Florida's stiff new Uniform Trade Secret Act took
effect, raising penalties for those who improperly divulge or
receive the trade secrets of another.
   Hamilton, an engineer for Tropicana Products Inc., from Dec. 6,
1982, to March 4 was involved in secret processes that enable
Tropicana to produce its pure premium brand orange juice.
   In early 1988, Tropicana became aware of industry reports that
Coke's Minute Maid division intended to produce a pasteurized
orange juice to compete with Pure Premium.
   ``Tropicana has devoted 40 years to producing the highest
quality product available anywhere, not just in orange juice but in
all its juice beverages,'' said Brent Gabler, vice president of
manufacturing for Tropicana.
   ``We simply could not stand by and allow the results of 40 years
of work to suddenly reach the hands of our competition. We are very
grateful that the Florida Legislature is aware of the needs of
companies which have developed sophisticated processes to protect
their trade secrets,'' Gabler said.

   Publisher Malcolm Stevenson Forbes, as
usual, made Forbes Magazine's list of the 400 richest people in
America, and as usual, he chose not to disclose his own wealth.
   Forbes has kept his net worth a closely guarded secret, and
aides to the publishing mogul contend that he may not even know
where he falls on the list.
   Saying no official wealth estimate is available, the magazine
has made him No. 113 on the list, between Laszlo Nandor Tauber,
worth $500 million, and John Thomas Lupton, worth $480 million.
   But really, how much is he worth?
   ``One thing I can say for sure, he's definitely worth between
$225 million and $6 billion,'' said Harold Seneker, a Forbes editor.
   Being publisher has its privileges for the Far Hills
million-or-billionaire. In short, he doesn't publish how much he's
worth because he doesn't have to.
   ``There is no (dollar figure) for him simply because he feels
it's his prerogative as owner of the magazine not to release his
net worth,'' said Forbes spokesman Ray Healey. ``He just chooses to
keep it to himself.''
   But really, how much is he worth?
   ``I don't think he even knows what it is and I don't think he's
in any hurry to have it figured out,'' said Don Garson, director of
corporate communications for Forbes.
   It would be unfair to Forbes to print his worth, Garson said,
because the dollar figures for the other 399 people listed are
presumed estimated, and Forbes' would be presumed factual since it
is his magazine.
   While the Oct. 24 issue includes outsiders' estimates of Forbes'
worth, they range dramatically. The London Daily Mail guesses $400
million, Newsday estimates his worth between $400 million and $700
million, and New York's Daily News simply says he's a
``billionaire.''
   In addition to Forbes Magazine, which his father launched in
1917, Forbes, 69, owns American Heritage magazine, Somerset Press,
a 400-square-mile Colorado ranch, a South Sea island, a London
mansion and a French chateau, among other holdings.

   Shailer L. Bass, a former board chairman
and chief executive officer of Dow Corning Corp., has died at age
82.
   Bass, who died Sunday at Provincial House Midland following a
lengthy illness, joined Dow Chemical Co. in 1936 and served as
research director on cellulose ethers and other compounds.
   He is credited with developing the first commercial silicone
product, a substance used to protect aircraft ignition systems.
Bass was active in the founding of Dow Corning and served as its
director of research.
   Bass was elected vice president and assistant general manager of
Dow Corning in 1954 and executive vice president in 1960. Seven
years later he became president, chief executive officer and board
chairman. He retired in April 1971.
   Bass is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and seven children.
   Funeral services tentatively were set for Saturday in Midland.

   Ben T. Craig, president of First Union
Corp., died Monday of cancer, the banking company announced. He was
55.
   Craig, a Gastonia native and graduate of Davidson College, died
at his Charlotte home, said First Union spokesman Marshall Hester.
   Craig was chairman and chief executive officer of Northwestern
Financial Corp. until 1985, when the Greensboro-based company
merged with First Union. After the merger, Craig became president
of First Union Corp. and chairman and chief executive officer of
First Union National Bank of North Carolina.
   ``Ben Craig's contributions to First Union and the banking
industry were incalculable,'' said Edward E. Crutchfield Jr., First
Union Corp. chairman and chief executive officer. ``He was a valued
colleague and a great friend, and we will all miss him.''
   Craig began his banking career in 1954 as an assistant vice
president for finance for Wachovia Bank & Trust Co. In 1963, he
became executive vice president and director of finance and
administration at The Bank of Lancaster in Lancaster, S.C. Four
years later he became treasurer of Springs Mills, Inc., of Fort
Mill, S.C., and in 1972 was named president of American Bank and
Trust Company of Reading, Pa.
   He became chairman of Northwestern in 1978. Under his leadership
the company doubled its assets in seven years, to $2.9 billion at
the time of its merger with First Union, a $28.4 billion bank
holding company that operates largely in the Southeast.
   Graveside services Craig were scheduled for p.m. Tuesday in
Davidson, and a memorial service was scheduled for Wednesday in
Charlotte.

   Continental Airlines has named two executives to
new positions in charge of marketing and finance and planning, the
airline's president announced Monday.
   Continental President Martin R. Shugrue said John W. Nelson
would serve as vice president in charge of marketing and Mickey
Foret will serve as executive vice president of finance and
planning.
   Nelson will be responsible for all of Houston-based
Continental's marketing activities, including advertising, sales,
marketing programs, pricing, reservations and customer relations,
Shugrue said.
   Nelson joined Continental from Eastern Airlines, where during
the last 20 years held several vice president positions in charge
of sales, personnel, revenue accounting, southern region and
Florida-Bahamas. Most recently, he was senior vice president in
charge of marketing.
   Eastern and Continental are owned by Texas Air Corp.
   Foret's new responsibilities include strategic planning, airline
planning and scheduling, treasury, financial planning and control,
accounting, properties and facilities, purchasing and management
information systems.
   Foret joined Texas International Airlines in 1974 and held
positions of assistant treasurer and vice president in charge of
financial services among others in the finance department.
   He was named finance vice preident and treasurer of Continental
following the merger of Texas International and Continental in
1982, and was promoted to vice president of finance and chief
financial officer in 1984. In October 1986, he joined Miami-based
Eastern and earlier this year was named senior vice president of
Houston-based Texas Air.

<HEAD>Cruise Executive To Become President Of North American Philips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Einar Kloster, chairman of Kloster Cruise Ltd., the
parent company of Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Viking Line,
said Monday he will become president of the electronics
conglomerate North American Philips starting Jan. 1.
   Kloster said he intends to remain chairman of Kloster Cruise and
make strategic decisions for the Miami-based company. Trygve
Hegnar, recently appointed as president and chief executive, will
handle day-to-day operations.
   Before taking over the cruise business in 1986, Kloster spent 25
years in executive positons at Philips's Netherlands-based parent,
which employs 340,000 worldwide and recorded $27 billion in sales
last year.
   North American Philips is a wholly owned subsidiary with 55,000
employees and $5.5 billion in annual sales.
   During his two years in charge of the cruise lines, Kloster
consolidated management and cut costs by moving NCL's headquarters
from Oslo to Miami, reflagging the company's ships and hiring crew
members at lower wages from Third World countries.
