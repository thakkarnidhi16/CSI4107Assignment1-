<HEAD>UPI `Alive And Kicking,' Looks To Profit Next Year</HEAD>

   United Press International is ``alive and
kicking'' and expects to turn a modest profit in the third quarter
of 1989, says UPI president Paul Steinle.
   Steinle also announced that UPI has reached agreement to provide
financial and stock market information from Standard & Poor's Corp.
for its newspaper clients.
   ``I am happy to tell you ... that UPI is alive and well and
kicking,'' Steinle told a news conference at the National Press
Club on Wednesday.
   Reviewing the first six months since he took over day-to-day
operation of the news service from Mexican newspaper publisher
Mario Vazquez Rana in February, Steinle said the new UPI management
team is on schedule with initiatives designed to reverse operating
losses that totaled $18 million last year.
   Steinle said UPI has slashed administrative costs by more than
$10 million, reorganized its business operations and raised between
$8 million and $10 million toward its goal of $15 million in
capital funds from outside ``institutional investors,'' including
some British lenders.
   He said UPI has reached a one-year agreement with the Wire
Service Guild, plans to open a fourth new domestic news bureau soon
and is hiring employees for a new regional business report being
launched in October.
   Net staff layoffs have been held to less than the 150 employees
planned when UPI's ``turnaround business plan'' was announced on
March 30, he said. The UPI staff now totals about 1,150 employees
worldwide, he said.
   Steinle said loss of UPI subscribers since the end of 1987 has
produced a drop of $3 million to $5 million in estimated annual
revenues of about $70 million. He said some other newspapers have
signed contracts but he declined to identify them.
   He said ``reaction is favorable'' to a new UPI marketing
strategy of selling 11 individually priced news services separately
to its newspaper subscribers. The list will be expanded to 23
products in the future, he said.
   Steinle said UPI expects to post another, much smaller operating
loss this year and show a ``small profit'' in the July-September
quarter of 1989. He refused to give dollar estimates, but last
March he and UPI chairman Earl W. Brian projected a $100,000
third-quarter profit next year.
   Steinle estimated that the non-media share of UPI's estimated
$70 million in annual revenues will grow from about $3 million last
year to between $15 million and $18 million in the next five years.

   Fourteen Greenpeace members opposed to ocean
dumping staged an acrobatic protest during Wednesday evening's rush
hour, swinging on ropes beneath the Triborough Bridge as they
unfurled a huge banner.
   NEW YORK (AP) _ Fourteen Greenpeace members swung on ropes
beneath the Triborough Bridge on Wednesday to protest ocean
dumping, and tied up traffic on the span and on the East River
below, authorities said.
   The demonstrators took to the bridge at 5:45 p.m., dangling
above the East River with their banner reading ``Stop Ocean Dumping
Now,'' said Greenpeace spokesman Andrew Davis.
   They hoped to block barges carrying sludge for ocean dumping, he
said. But Tina Casey, spokeswoman for the Department of
Environmental Conservation, said no barges were scheduled to depart
during the protest.
   ``So far, it hasn't affected us at all,'' she said.
   The protest forced officials to shut down two westbound lanes of
the bridge, which links Manhattan and the Bronx with Queens, while
eastbound traffic was at a near standstill due to rubber-necking,
authorities said.
   After more than five hours, the protesters remained suspended
about 100 feet above the water, forcing the Coast Guard to stop all
traffic on the waterway from passing under the bridge, said Coast
Guard spokesman Joe Gibson.
   ``Basically, we're waiting it out,'' said Gibson. ``There's not
too much we can do.''
   It was the second Greenpeace action in as many days aimed
against the Wards Island Sewage Station.
   Davis said the swinging protesters planned to lower themselves
and deny access to any sewage barges leaving the station, which is
on the East River island.
   On Tuesday, five members of the worldwide ecological group were
arrested after they chained a dinghy to the rear of a sewage barge,
with a protester chained to a mooring line for the dinghy, police
said.
   That protest delayed the departure of the barge for three hours,
authorities said. The barge, one of four operated by the city, was
heading to an ocean dumping site 106 miles from New York Harbor.

<DATELINE>CANCUN, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gilbert, one of the strongest
storms ever, slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday and
leveled thatched homes, tore off roofs, uprooted trees and cut off
the Caribbean resorts of Cancun and Cozumel.
   Looters roamed the streets of Cancun, stealing from stores whose
windows were blown away. Huge waves battered the beach resorts and
thousands were evacuated. Despite the intensity of the onslaught
and the ensuing heavy flooding, officials reported only two minor
injuries.
   The storm killed 19 people in Jamaica and five in the Dominican
Republic before moving west to Mexico. Prime Minister Edward Seaga
of Jamaica said Wednesday the storm destroyed an estimated 100,000
of Jamaica's 500,000 homes when it throttled the island Monday.
   The Jamaican Embassy reported earlier that 500,000 of the
nation's 2.3 million people were homeless.
   In Cancun, amateur radio operators said an oil tanker from the
fleet of the government oil monopoly Pemex, the Lazaro Cardenas,
had run aground on the beach in the Cancun hotel zone. Pemex
officials however said all their vessels were secure.
   Army officials in Mexico City said about 35,000 people were
evacuated from Cancun, but Cancun Mayor Jose Sanchez Zapata said
about 11,000 fled.
   More than 120,000 people on the northeast Yucatan coast were
evacuated, the Yucatan state government said.
   The eye of the storm passed over Cozumel and Cancun with howling
winds clocked at 160 mph at about 8 a.m. EDT. The winds bent and
toppled utility poles and uprooted slum dwellings.
   Ham radio operators around Cancun said Gilbert knocked down a
radio and television communications tower, uprooted trees and blew
the roofs off buildings.
   Floods prevented officials from reaching the hotel zone in
Cancun and there were no relief efforts under way by late
Wednesday. Shelters had little or no food, water or blankets and
power was out.
   ``We can't do it yet. The wind would blow them away,'' said an
army official at city hall who declined to give his name.
   Bands of 25-30 youths roamed the streets of Cancun Wednesday,
looting stores with shattered windows, said Alfredo Moro Sanchez,
investigative coordinator of the Quintana Roo state judicial police.
   He said he asked for army troops to halt the looting but none
had arrived by late Wednesday.
   About 150 tourists took refuge at the Cancun city hall.
Honeymooner Sheila Fournier of Long Island said she and her
husband, Pete, had been evacuated from the Villas Playa Hotel.
   ``It had an ocean-front view _ which is now washed away,'' she
said.
   Officials were checking low-lying areas of Cancun for stranded
residents. There was heavy damage visible to the humble wood and
thatch homes typical of the Yucatan.
   ``There were some people who did not want to leave yesterday,''
the army official said. ``It was something new. They didn't know
what a cyclone was.''
   At midnight EDT Gilbert was centered near latitude 21.5 north,
longitude 90.2 west and approaching the north coast of Yucatan,
about 60 miles east-northeast of the provincial capital, Merida,
the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said. The
storm was about 550 miles southeast of Brownsville, Texas, the
center said in a statement.
   Gilbert was moving west-northwest at 15 mph and winds had
decreased to 125 mph. The Mexican National Weather Service reported
winds gusting as high as 218 mph earlier Wednesday with sustained
winds of 179 mph.
   Earlier Wednesday Gilbert was classified as a Category 5 storm,
the strongest ad deadliest type of hurricane. Such storms have
maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause
catastrophic damage.
   By Wednesday night the National Hurricane Center downgraded it
to a Category 4, but center director Bob Sheets said:``There's no
question it'll strengthen again once it comes off the Yucatan
Peninsula and gets back in open water.''
   As Gilbert moved away from the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday
night, the hurricane formed a double eye, two concentric circles of
thunderstorms often characteristic of a strong storm that has
crossed land and is moving over the water again.
   One eye was about eight miles wide, and the second about 25
miles wide, said hurricane center meteorologist Jesse Moore. ``This
is one of the features that we expected to see as the hurricane
moved back over the water, and we do expect intensification,'' he
said.
   Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _ the
1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and Hurricane Camille
that devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969, killing 256 people.
   Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the
Gulf of Mexico.
   The peninsula ports of Campeche, Celestum, Progreso, Sinzal,
Ucaltepen, Tel-Chac, Cancun, Puerto Morelos, and Ciudad del Carmen
were closed, the government news agency Notimex said. Airports in
the region were closed.
   ``The sound of the wind outside is horrible,'' said receptionist
Pablo Torres at Cancun's Hotel Carrillos as the storm approached.
   The National Hurricane Center said a hurricane watch was in
effect on the Texas coast from Brownsville to Port Arthur and along
the coast of northeast Mexico from Tampico north.
   In Mexico City, the National Civil Defense System said it lost
telephone contact with Cancun and Cozumel at about 8 a.m. EDT.
   Public buildings in Cancun were used as shelters, said Cecila
Lavalle, a spokesman for Quintana Roo state government in Chetumal,
155 miles southeast of Cozumel.
   Jennie Valdez, a U.S. consular representative in Cancun, said
she did not know how many tourists were in Cancun, but government
figures estimate 40,000 to 65,000 monthly visitors.
   Hurricane warnings were in effect for the entire Yucatan
Peninsula and widespread evacuations were reported.
   Winds destroyed at least 100 homes in slums of Valladolid, a
town of about 45,000 about 100 miles from Cozumel, Alberto Pol, a
judicial police officer, said by telephone.
   The National Hurricane Center said Gilbert was the most intense
storm on record in terms of barometric pressure. It was measured at
26.31 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935
hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.
   ``That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western
Hemisphere,'' said forecaster Mark Zimmer.
   On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, Gilbert pounded the Dominican
Republic, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.
   Seaga said Jamaica would need $8 billion in aid. Officials in
the Dominican Republic, sideswiped Sunday by the storm, reported
five dead.
   Gilbert also buffeted the Cayman Islands, but no deaths were
reported.

Libya, her third this year.

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya's new entrepreneurs gather at the
bus depot until there's at least five or six of them, pile into old
Peugeot station wagons used as a taxis _ and rumble off to Tunisia.
   They are taking advantage of a recent relaxation of economic and
travel restrictions.
   After a 95-mile drive to the border, they can buy Japanese
radios, televisions, furniture or other goods difficult to find in
Libya: batteries, watches, polo shirts.
   They also might do some selling. Many Libyans buy up at
subsidized prices whatever they can find in the poorly-stocked
state supermarkets and sell to Tunisians at a profit.
   In a speech to the nation on Sept. 1, the 19th anniversary of
his seizing power in a coup, Moammar Gadhafi said Libyans could
become ``bourgeois,'' as long as they don't accumulate wealth by
exploiting others. A few days earlier, he declared that black
markets were fine because ``it's what the people want,'' though the
revolution rejects capitalism.
   As recently as two years ago, what the people wanted seemed to
count little.
   Following dramatic drops in crude oil prices in mid-decade,
Libya decided to concentrate its shrinking income on the oil
industry and the military. It left foreign companies with hundreds
of millions of dollars in unpaid bills and stopped virtually all
imports of consumer goods.
   Shoppers waited on bread lines and scoured shelves in vain for
eggs and cheese. Soap powder, toilet paper and toothpaste were
scarce, even on the black market.
   Such shortages didn't sit well with Libyans, who under Gadhafi
had grown accustomed to one of Africa's highest standards of
living, estimated at $6,000 per capita by the Middle East Economic
Digest.
   Newspapers carried letters from unhappy Libyans. Consumers stood
up and complained at local meetings of Basic People's Congresses,
the grass-roots governing bodies.
   Making matters worse was Gadhafi's 1985 order expelling tens of
thousands of foreign workers. Under the revolutionary system,
Libyans are forbidden to work for other Libyans, except for
relatives or in profit-sharing jobs in industry. Suddenly, farms
had no Tunisian workers; hotels, no Moroccan waiters.
   Most foreign businessmen and diplomats, who spoke on condition
of anonymity for fear of reprisal, say that Gadhafi became worried
about his popularity, especially after the United States bombed the
cities of Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986 to retaliate for what
Washington called his support of terrorists.
   Last October, the border between Tunisia and Libya was reopened,
allowing workers to return. A few months later, Gadhafi liberalized
trade between the two countries.
   The colonel was obtensibly in quest of unity with his North
African neighbors, but economic needs, too, loomed large in the
rapprochement.
   In March, Libyan authorities quietly allowed small businesses to
import some goods for sale. Until then, what imports were permitted
arrived through giant state companies. Gadhafi recently criticized
these firms as corrupt, saying their employees often kept the
goods, especially coveted car parts, for themselves and friends.
   Tunisians now stream into Libya, their cars loaded with
foreign-made cigarettes, appliances and clothing. At Tripoli's
``souk,'' or traditional outdoor market, they elbow for space to
hawk their wares in streets that were virtually empty of shoppers a
year ago.
   There have been other changes.
   ``Before, we had to sell everything to the government and wait
sometimes 20 days or a month for payment,'' said a cloth maker in
his shop in Tripoli's main souk. ``Now everyone comes to the market
to buy _ at 11 a.m., it's so crowded you can't even move,'' he says.
   Down the block, a man cooks omelettes at an outdoor table and
stuffs them into rolls for hungry shoppers. Two elderly women
shrouded in white spread out a mat on the ground and sell
barrettes, cologne and imported hand lotion. Arabic music blares
from a speaker on one table, where tapes by popular Western
performers like Madonna and Sting are also for sale.
   Some items are still in short supply. Chicken seems to be
everywhere, but veal and beef are hard to find.
   Still, the goods in the souk put to shame the so-called
supersouks, the state-run supermarkets the government had hoped
would put an end to private enterprise.
   One day this month, grocery shelves of one supermarket were bare
of meat. There was little but soap bars, locally produced honey,
imported powdered milk, and a counter filled with 4.5 pound
packages of Finnish Edam cheese.
   Some Libyans, like one 64-year-old taxi driver, are cautious
about their economic future. He said he and his 16 children would
like to open their own business but that he won't invest his
savings until satisfied that Gadhafi won't pull in the reins on the
freer economy.
   Meanwhile, the nation itself has joined in the wheeling and
dealing. Keen on generating an income apart from pumping oil, Libya
has invested in a chain of gasoline stations in Italy, Libya's
largest trading partner. It is also reportedly looking into opening
petrochemical plants in Europe.

   Superman wasn't available to rescue Terry
Rickerd when her car rolled onto her chest, but two bystanders
performed a mighty good imitation of the missing Man of Steel.
   Gary Robinson, 49, of Redding, and John Maclellan, 35, of nearby
French Gulch, lifted Rickerd's Pontiac 6000 sedan and freed her
Tuesday at the gasoline pumps of Robinson's convenience store, said
police officer Rich Schneck.
   She was treated at Mercy Medical Center in Redding and released.
   ``He doesn't look like he could lift a fly swatter, but he's a
heck of a lot stronger than he looks,'' Wendy Wright, an employee
at the store, said of Robinson, who owns the Oasis AM-PM
Mini-Market.
   ``I guess in an emergency situation like that your adrenaline
just gets going,'' Miss Wright said.
   Police said Rickerd drove in to buy gasoline, but couldn't pull
up to the pumps because other cars were in the way. She put the car
in neutral and climbed out, carrying her 15-month-old son.
   Suddenly, the car started to roll. She tried to get back in to
stop it, but was knocked to the ground by the door and the car
rolled on her.
   The little boy rolled free and was uninjured.
   ``Gary came inside and said he and this guy John had lifted up
the car and she got out,'' Wright said. ``He was shaking so bad he
couldn't even write out our paychecks.''

   Facts and figures about Lesotho:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Lesotho, entirely inside the borders of South Africa,
is a mountainous kingdom covering 11,720 square miles, roughly the
size of Maryland.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Virtually all of Lesotho's approximately 1.6
million people are from the indigenous Basotho tribe. Roughly 70
percent of the people are Christian, about 45 percent of them Roman
Catholics. English and Sesotho are the official languages. Maseru,
with about 100,000 people, is the capital and largest city. Roughly
one-half of the adult male labor force works as migrant laborers in
South African mines. About 55 percent of the people are literate.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ At present, the country's most lucrative natural
resource is water. It has signed an agreement with South Africa to
sell water from the massive, multimillion-dollar Lesotho Highlands
Water project, construction of which has just begun. Only 13
percent of the land is able to be cultivated and 20 percent of the
country's food must be imported. Some small-scale mining and
manufacturing exist.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Formerly known as Basutoland, Lesotho was the scene of
fighting between the Basotho and white Afrikaner settlers until
Britain took responsibility for the country and made it a
protectorate in 1984. It became independent on Oct. 4, 1966. In
January 1986, military officers overthew the long-ruling, leftist
prime minister, Leabua Jonathan, whose relations with South Africa
had become increasingly strained. The military council remains in
control, and administers the government in consultation with King
Moshoeshoe II.

<HEAD>US Experts Think Test Explosion Did Not Exceed 150 Kiloton Limit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. experts are conducting further analysis
to assure themselves that the United States did not exceed a
nuclear testing limit during a joint experiment with the Soviets
last month.
   The explosive yield from the Aug. 17 test was supposed to have
been about 140 kilotons, equivalent to 140,000 tons of TNT.
However, instruments indicated it may have been as high as 153
kilotons to 160 kilotons.
   The Corrtex devices used to measure the force of the blast are
thought to have a margin of error of 30 percent, and Assistant
Defense Secretary Ron Lehman said Wednesday that preliminary
analysis indicates the blast actually was below the 150 kiloton
limit set by the 1974 nuclear Threshold Test Ban Treaty.
   ``We are doing some chemical analysis,'' Lehman said. ``But all
the signs that we have are that it was under 150.''
   Lehman spoke as U.S. and Soviet scientists were conducting the
second half of the Joint Verification Experiment, which Americans
hope will sell the Russians on Corrtex, a system of measuring the
size of a nuclear blast by means of a cable sunk adjacent to the
test site.
   The Soviets for the first time allowed U.S. government
scientists to monitor an explosion Wednesday at a Soviet test site
and permitted American reporters to cover the event from the scene.
   The official news agency, Tass, said the explosion had a force
of 100 kilotons to 150 kilotons.
   If the Soviets agree to the use of Corrtex in addition to
seismic devices for measuring superpower nuclear tests, the two
sides are expected to sign protocols to the Threshold Test Ban
Treaty and the related 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty
limiting the size of nuclear blasts for engineering purposes.

   President Reagan's Saturday radio talks, which
started six years ago as a vehicle for him to speak directly to the
people about his programs, are sounding more and more like weekly
campaign speeches for George Bush.
   There has been no suggestion that the broadcasts be treated as
paid political advertisements, as they were when Reagan ran for
re-election in 1984, but Democrats and Republicans agree there has
been a sharp increase in political content.
   ``It is appropriate to make political remarks in the context of
government and administration programs,'' says White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``Also, there is a Democratic response
and a Democratic opportunity to make the same kind of remarks _
which they take advantage of.''
   ``The president has stepped up the heat on the debate,'' said
another administration source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``He has engaged himself more fully in the political dialogue that
is going on.''
   ``It's just not unexpected,'' said a Democratic source on
Capitol Hill, where Democrats coordinate their weekly broadcast
response to the president's speech.
   Fitzwater said the big difference between now and 1984, when
Reagan's speeches became political ads paid for by the Republican
National Committee, is that the president is not a candidate for
re-election this year.
   The man who is running for his job, Vice President George Bush,
is getting plenty of help from him, however.
   ``His name does tend to pop up'' in the speeches, the
administration source said.
   It popped up seven times, for instance, on Aug. 13, when the
president devoted his speech to a preview of the Republican
National Convention.
   It popped up twice on July 30, when the president talked about
his Central American policies and mentioned that he and Bush had
both visited ailing Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte in
his hospital room.
   It popped up again last Saturday, when Reagan reviewed
administration educational policy and said, ``George Bush and I
have been there with a sympathetic ear and a helping hand.''
   And then there was the Labor Day weekend address on Sept. 3,
when the president talked about the administration-backed Job
Partnership Training Act and threw in the fact that it was
sponsored chiefly by Sen. Dan Quayle, the GOP candidate for vice
president.
   Even when he isn't mentioning anybody by name, Reagan's radio
words are vintage campaign rhetoric.
   On Aug. 6, he said, ``It was just eight years ago that America's
defenses were in a pitiable state.''
   On Aug. 13, he said ``some in the other party are ... talking
about what they claim they'd do if they were elected. Well, while
they talk, we deliver.''
   On Aug. 27, he said, ``Before we took office in 1981, the globe
was reeling from an explosion of international turbulence.''
   On Sept. 3, he said that ``in the year we took office, the
average family made only about 70 percent of what it needed to buy
a new home. Today, that family makes 110 percent of what it needs
and it can afford to buy the house.''
   Administration officials maintain that the president's radio
speeches are, for the most part, philosophical rather than
partisan, drawing the line between liberals and conservatives
rather than lambasting the opposition.
   That ``other party'' that was in party eight years ago, however,
is called the Democrats.

   The Agriculture Department has moved closer to
implementing new rules to help thousands of farmers rearrange their
debts and hang on to their land.
   A new ``interim'' rule that is a major step in putting into
effect some of the key provisions of the Agricultural Credit Act of
1987 was officially published Wednesday, a step in the federal
rule-making procedure.
   Many of the law's provisions have already been put into effect.
But some, including massive write-downs of farmers' debts to the
Farmers Home Administration, will take effect this fall.
   Proposed rules were initially announced May 23 and specified a
30-day period for public comment. The next step was adoption of the
interim rule.
   By doing this, the Farmers Home Administration served notice
that it intends to put the new rules into effect in 30 days, or on
Oct. 14. In addition, the agency specified a 60-day comment period,
meaning the public can have its say until mid-November before FmHA
makes its decisions final.
   Meanwhile, according to FmHA officials, the interim rule clears
the way for agency field offices to begin carrying out some of the
most important parts of the 1987 credit act, including
restructuring or write-down of debt.
   This provision will allow FmHA to reduce a farmer's delinquent
debt to the recovery value of the collateral, which is usually land
or farm equipment, depending on cash flow and other factors.
   A Preliminary Regulator Impact Analysis was published by the
agency last May, and a summary of the report was updated and
included in the interim rule published this week.
   The analysis showed that of about 118,000 borrowers delinquent
in early 1986, about 37,000 were ``considered able to resolve
delinquency through normal servicing actions, including
subordination, rescheduling and deferral'' of debt.
   Of the remaining 81,000 borrowers eligible for consideration of
restructuring with write-down of debt, about 16,000 were estimated
to be able to show they could repay their remaining debt, thereby
qualifying for the write-down.
   An estimated 54,000 were estimated to be unable to show
repayment ability and would be rejected for write-down.
   The remaining 11,000 were said to be ineligible for write-downs
because their debt was less than recovery value from liquidation of
their assets.
   According to the analysis, the loss to FmHA could total $2.7
billion for write-down of debt owed by the borrowers able to cash
flow, and $6.7 billion for those unable to qualify. However, those
losses could be reduced by an estimated $1 billion through
provisions allowing FmHA to recapture some of the debt.
   The agency's document summarized some of the 247 comments
received after the initial proposal was made last May. Some of the
general comments received by FmHA included:
   _I am happy to see that small farmers can have their debts
written down to where they can handle it and stay in business.
   _The regulations are unfair to those who have to pay their debts
in full at higher interest rates.
   _The regulations are discriminatory.
   _Keeping these farmers in business adds to the surplus, on one
hand, while on the other hand the government buys up the surplus
and supports prices.
   _Credit is too easy. The government should foreclose.
   _Many FmHA borrowers are poor managers; they spend money they do
not have.

   The Agriculture Department says it erred in
giving out a telephone number for people to call offering comments
on a proposal to allow a mixture of salvaged meat and bone in
hotdogs without stating the ingredients on labels.
   A terse ``correction'' notice by the department's information
office said Wednesday that all comments should be submitted in
writing by Nov. 8.
   Dave Warren, USDA press chief, said agency officials were ``not
prepared to take oral comments, so they'll have to be in writing.''
   The proposal was announced by USDA on Monday. It would allow
processors to include a mixture of salvaged meat, including small
bits of bone, to be used in up to 10 percent of the meat content of
hotdogs and similar items without showing the ingredients on
product labels.
   The salvaged product, designated as MS(S), or mechanically
separated (species, such as pork or beef), is made by grinding up
ribs, neckbones and other hard-to-carve parts of slaughtered
animals and forcing the mixture through sieves.
   Most of the bone particles are screened out, but some _ about
the size of ground pepper flakes _ remain in the mixture.
   Current regulations permit the MS(S) to comprise up to 20
percent of the meat portion of hotdogs, bologna and other sausages,
but the labels must state the contents.
   Processors, who asked for the exemption from the labeling rule,
said they can't sell consumers on the idea of having such a mixture
in hotdogs under the present labeling requirement.
   The written comments can be sent by Nov. 8 to: Policy Office,
Attn: Linda Carey, Hearing Clerk, Food Safety and Inspection
Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 3171-S, Washington,
D.C. 20250.

   World sugar production in 1988-89 is expected
to be a record of about 107.1 million metric tons, up 3 percent
from slightly less than 103.8 million tons produced in 1987-88,
says the Agriculture Department.
   The new estimate also was up from the 103.9 million tons
forecast in June, the department said Wednesday in a report.
   ``Substantial improvements are foreseen for some of the world's
major sugar cane-producing countries, including Australia, Brazil,
Cuba and India,'' the report said. ``Unusually good conditions have
also boosted production estimates for the sugar beet crops now
being harvested in the European (Economic) Community and the Soviet
Union.''
   Production of U.S. beet and cane sugar in 1988-89 was forecast
at 6.8 million tons, raw value, down 6.7 percent from last season's
record 7.29 million tons.

<HEAD>Red Cross Releases Results of Internal Review and Agreement With
FDA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRISPIN Y. CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   An internal review of the Red Cross's blood
service regions indicates that more than 2,400 blood products were
released improperly over a six-month period _ 518 of them without
complete testing for deadly diseases.
   ``The review found no indication that any Red Cross center
issued blood for transfusion that had a confirmed positive test for
AIDS or hepatitis B,'' said Dr. S. Gerald Sandler of Red Cross
blood services told a news conference Wednesday.
   Despite this, he noted that the 518 blood products had been
issued before all record checks or testing had been completed.
``That information was not known at the time of their release, and
the products should not have been released,'' Sandler said.
   Dr. Ernst R. Jaffe, chairman of the organization's Blood Service
Committee, meanwhile, announced that the Red Cross, in compliance
with the recommendations of its review board, signed a voluntary
agreement with the Food and Drug Administration to help avoid such
errors in the future.
   ``Less than a year ago, Red Cross discovered that the increase
in the number of tests conducted and blood samples quarantined also
increased the potential for human error,'' he said.
   Following the release of improperly tested blood products at
facilities in Washington, D.C., earlier this year, the Red Cross
committed itself to ``a national zero error goal and launched a
nationwide review'' to determine the extent of these mistakes and
to develop ways to reduce their potential, Jaffe said.
   The investigation revealed that of 6 million blood products,
576,426 were quarantined or destroyed properly, while 2,420 were
released improperly, including the 518 released before all testing
was completed, he said. The six-month period when this occurred was
September 1987 to March 1988.
   ``Most mistakes involved donations that tested negative for
AIDS, but for various reasons were not in compliance with Red Cross
or FDA directives that require such donations to be quarantined
and-or destroyed,'' Victor W. Schmitt, vice president of Red Cross
blood services, said in a statement.
   ``An example given is the situation in which a donor who
received previous false-positive test results gives blood again.
FDA and Red Cross require that any subsequent donations be
quarantined and-or destroyed, even when they test negative for AIDS
and hepatitis B.''
   In the cases in which improperly tested blood products had been
released, Sandler said the donors were contacted for retesting to
assure that no tainted blood had been transmitted.
   The review found that 88 percent of the mistaken releases were
concentrated in four Red Cross regions: the Carolinas region based
in Charlotte, N.C.; the Midwest region based in Omaha, Neb.; the
Missouri-Illinois region based in St. Louis; and the Tidewater
region based in Norfolk, Va.
   The survey also found that serious deviations from FDA and Red
Cross directives occurred in five regions: the Midwest Region; the
Missouri-Illinois region; the Carolinas region; the Tennessee
Valley region based in Nashville; and the Northeastern New York
region based in Albany, N.Y.
   Meanwhile, 26 of the 56 Red Cross centers were found not to have
released any blood products improperly, another 20 centers had
fewer than 10 improper releases each, with eight of those having
only one erroneous release apiece.
   Corrective measures being implemented by the Red Cross include:
   _The suspension or replacement of top medical administrative
personnel.
   _The institution of a new national clearance system for plasma
that will recheck each unit prior to processing.
   _Ongoing evaluation and development of improvement in computer
systems.
   _Retraining staff in FDA practices and Red Cross standards, as
well as specific procedures for laboratory and computer operations.
   _Completing a review of regional standard operating procedures
with the FDA and initiating a further comprehensive review of all
operating procedures in order to update and advise regions of the
requirements.

   Nicholas F. Brady is heading to his first
international meeting as Treasury secretary with the overwhelming,
but not unanimous, support of the Senate.
   Brady, co-chairman of the Wall Street investment house Dillon
Read & Co., was confirmed on a 92-2 vote Wednesday by senators
anxious to give him strong support before next week's meeting of
the Group of Seven, composed of finance ministers from the United
States and its six leading trading partners.
   ``If we did not confirm Nick Brady, he would go with a little
bit of a cloud over his head,'' said Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon,
ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee.
   He was joined in a plea for unanimity by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   But two Democratic senators, annoyed by a Brady comment that
they say minimized the seriousness of the federal budget deficit,
declined to join in the bipartisan praise and voted no.
   Kent Conrad of North Dakota and Harry Reid of Nevada opposed the
nomination, citing a statement by Brady in his confirmation hearing
Tuesday that the federal government could grow its way out of the
budget deficit.
   Brady said the deficit ``needs to be worked down,'' but struck
an upbeat note by saying, ``I do think we can grow our way out of
this'' and adding at another point, ``I see no reason at this
moment why taxes have to be raised.''
   ``Mr. Brady says, `Don't worry, we'll grow out of it.' Well the
truth is different and the truth will out,'' Conrad said in remarks
on the floor before the vote.
   Reid did not speak on the nomination, but his press secretary,
Mary O'Driscoll, said Reid ``was angered by Brady's statement that
we are going to grow out of the deficit. He thought that was
irresponsible and he does not think a Treasury secretary should
believe something like that.''
   Brady, after taking office, will be the third Treasury secretary
to serve under President Reagan. Donald Regan, who later became
White House chief of staff, held the Cabinet post from 1981 to
1985, turning it over to James A. Baker III, who resigned Aug. 17
to head Republican George Bush's presidential campaign.
   Although Brady is expected to do little more than serve as a
caretaker this year, he likely will stay at Treasury if Bush wins
in November.
   White House spokesman B.J. Cooper said a swearing-in ceremony
for Brady had not been scheduled, but said, ``it will be soon.''
   Brady, a wealthy man who lives on a 4,000-acre estate in New
Jersey's horse country, served eight months in the Senate in 1982,
appointed by the governor of New Jersey to replace Democrat
Harrison A. Williams Jr., who had resigned in the Abscam scandal.
   In his most recent government assignment, Brady headed a
presidential task force that studied the causes of the stock market
crash last October.
   Not voting were Sens. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; Dan Quayle,
R-Ind.; Christopher Bond, R-Mo.; John Danforth, R-Mo.; Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska; and Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii.

<HEAD>Study Says Airline Computer Reservation Systems Cut Competition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the nation's largest airlines have an
unfair competitive advantage because they own the computer
reservation systems that travel agents use to book passengers, a
congressional report says.
   The General Accouting Office study, released Wednesday,
concluded that the Department of Transportation should try to
correct the ``anti-competitive features'' of the reservation
systems. The GAO is Congress' investigative agency.
   Chairman Norman Mineta, D-Calif., whose House aviation
subcommittee held a hearing on the report, criticized the
Transportation Department for not acting sooner.
   ``The department appears to be unwilling to take any action'' on
computer reservation systems ``without substantial prodding and
adverse publicity,'' he said.
   The computer systems which the nation's travel agents use to
reserve seats on flights _ as well as rental cars and lodging _ are
owned by some of the nation's largest airlines. Each system's owner
earns money by collecting a fee from the airline on which a seat is
selected, and by charging travel agents an annual subscription fee
for use of the computer.
   American Airlines owns the SABRE system, which dominates the
market by garnering 43 percent of the country's computer
reservation system revenues. United Airline's Apollo system has 32
percent of the market; PARS, owned by Trans World Airlines and
Northwest Airlines, has 10 percent; Texas Air Corp.'s System One
has 10 percent; and Delta Airline's DATAS II has 5 percent.
   Until the government banned the practice in November 1984,
airlines owning computer reservation systems tended to list their
own flights first on the display screens, making it more likely
that they would sell more tickets.
   But the report cited statistics demonstrating that airlines
which own computer reservation systems continue to have ``an
artificial competitive advantage.''
   The GAO cited a May 1988 Transportation Department study
estimating that airlines which own computer reservation systems
increase their revenues between 9 percent and 40 percent over what
they would have earned without the computers.
   The DOT report also said the booking fees charged by the owners
of the two largest reservation systems _ about $1.84 per flight _
are about double the costs the owners incur.
   ``Competing airlines, who pay the booking fees, have little
alternative to paying those fees if they wish to remain competitive
in the air travel business,'' GAO concluded.
   The GAO study estimated that in 1986, SABRE transferred $343
million to American Airlines from other carriers in fees and lost
bookings; Apollo transferred $303 million; System One $84 million;
PARS $67 million; and DATAS II $46 million.
   ``These transfers ... reduce competition in the industry by
artificially imposing a cost penalty on some carriers and
subsidizing others,'' the GAO report said.
   The study also said it is difficult for rival airlines to start
new computer reservation systems because the contracts travel
agents sign typically last five years, and involve penalties for
termination.
   Robert L. Pettit, the transportation department's associate
deputy secretary, said the agency wants to ``proceed cautiously
before adopting any regulation that would reduce the vendors'
incentives to upgrade or market their systems or would lead to
higher costs for participating airlines or subscribers.''
   American Airlines spokesman John Hotard, speaking from the
company's offices in Fort Worth, Texas, said the systems operate
fairly.
   ``We think the marketplace should be the arena in which this
battle is fought,'' he said.

<HEAD>Two Strong Earthquakes Rock Northern Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two strong earthquakes hit Japan's northernmost
main island of Hokkaido Thursday, a meteorological agency said.
There were no reports of injury or damage.
   The first earthquake struck at 9:27 a.m. (8:27 p.m. EDT
Wednesday) and was centered off the coast of Hokkaido's eastern
port city of Nemuro, at a depth of about 30 miles, said Sotoharu
Taniguchi, a seismologist at the Sapporo District Meteorological
Observatory.
   He said a reading on the Richter scale was not available, but
added that it registered a 3 on the Japanese scale of 7 in Nemuro,
608 miles northwest of Tokyo.
   The epicenter of the second temblor, which registered a 5 on the
Richter and hit at 5:11 a.m. (4:11 p.m. EDT Wednesday), was located
in the southern part of the Hidaka mountain range at a depth of
about 42 miles, Taniguchi said.
   He added that the two quakes were unrelated and the epicenters
were about 120 miles apart.
   A tremor measuring 3 on the Japanese scale can shake buildings,
while a 4 will topple vases. The scale measures the intensity of an
earthquake at a particular location and is not convertible to the
Richter scale.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake according to
ground motion as recorded on seismographs. An earthquake of 5 on
the Richter is considered ``very strong'' and a 6 ``severe,''
capable of widespread damage near the epicenter.

<HEAD>Rice Industry Calls for Action to End Japanese Barriers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rice producer and processor groups are calling
on the government for a major campaign to end Japanese trade
barriers, including retaliation if nothing else works.
   ``The time has come for the government of Japan to take the
steps necessary for us to compete'' in the Japanese market, Sen.
David Pryor, D-Ark., told a news conference Wednesday at which the
request was announced.
   Rice producer groups petitioned U.S. Trade Representative
Clayton K. Yeutter for assistance on grounds that Japanese refusal
to permit rice imports represents an unfair trade barrier.
   Yeutter must decide within 45 days whether to proceed with the
case. The next step would be negotiation with Japan and, if that
failed, a request for relief under the 97-nation General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, a Geneva-based body that sets and monitors
international trade rules.
   Failure in that effort would trigger retaliatory action after
two years under the new trade law approved by Congress and signed
by President Reagan this summer.
   The president of Japan's 5.5 million member Central Union of
Agricultural Cooperatives, Mitsugu Horiuchi, reacted to the U.S.
industry's action by saying the petition ``could have a serious
influence on the political and economic relations between Japan and
the United States.''
   The move ``distorts a harmonious agricultural trade climate
between Japan and the U.S. in which the United States has a
substantial trade surplus,'' said the head of the farm
organization, which is known as the Zenchu.
   His statement was released in Washington by Zenchu spokesman
Bill Dabaghi, who said Japan already has made ``enormous strides''
in opening its agricultural markets by concluding beef and citrus
agreements with the United States this year.
   The Zenchu spokesman said the U.S. rice industry had acted
irresponsibly in raising the issue at the time of a presidential
campaign and ``hyperventilating it.'' He said opening the Japanese
rice market to American imports would be a disaster for that
nation's farmers.
   Japan has been the largest foreign buyer of American farm
products for more than two decades. Last year, it bought $5.5
billion worth and the total for 1988 is forecast at $6.9 million.
   Many of these purchases consist of corn and other feed grains
not grown in large quantities, if at all, in Japan. It has set up
rigid curbs on rice imports to protect its farmers from foreign
competition.
   Large-scale, high-tech American farming methods produce rice at
far below the Japanese cost levels. If all trade restraints were
swept away, American growers could be expected to command a
substantial share of the Japanese market in short order.
   Industry officials said rice priced at $300 a ton in the United
States would cost $2,500 a ton in Japan.
   They told the news conference, however, that they have no
intention of trying to wipe out Japanese rice farming.
   ``We are not looking for an opportunity to flood the Japanese
market,'' said J. Stephen Gabbert, president of the Rice Millers
Association. The group filed the trade petition in a joint effort
with the Rice Council for Market Development, a growers group.
   The petition seeks to gain 2.5 percent of the Japanese rice
market in the first of a four-year phase-in and expand to 10
percent, or 1 million tons, by the fourth year.
   Senators from rice-producing states were on hand to push the
petition, with Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., declaring the industry
had tried to get the Japanese to import American rice voluntarily.
   ``As always the response has been a virtual stone wall,'' said
Wilson. ``And that is not good enough.''

   Pictures of Kennedys, living and dead,
line the walls and decorate the tables of Patrick Kennedy's living
room.
   ``I've been given a name, and I think there's a certain
responsibility that goes hand-in-hand with that name,'' he once
said. ``It would be easier to sit back and enjoy all the things
I've been given.''
   Kennedy, 21, a Providence College junior and son of Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., achieved his goal of becoming a state
representative Wednesday night, defeating five-term incumbent John
Skeffington with 57 percent of the vote.
   For two years, as a member of the Young Democrats, he has worked
with and talked to neighbors in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of
northwest Providence.
   He is noncommittal about how long he will serve. His face merely
lights up when a questioner asks about any desires to follow the
rest of his family to Congress.
   His cousin, Joseph Kennedy Jr. of Boston, has represented
Cambridge, Mass., in Congress since 1986. Another cousin, Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend of Maryland, ran unsuccessfully for Congress the
same year.
   Kennedy's brother, Edward M. Kennedy Jr., and sister, Kara
Kennedy, Patrick's, are running their father's senatorial
re-election campaign this year.
   His late grandfather, Joseph Kennedy Sr. was the former U.S.
ambassaor to England.
   Slain President John F. Kennedy, Patrick's uncle, was a
Massachusetts representative and senator before winning the
nation's highest office in 1960. Robert Kennedy, former attorney
general and U.S. senator from New York, was running for president
when he was assassinated in 1968.
   Kennedy campaigned for better and more affordable health care,
better care for the elderly and a crime-free community. A campaign
breakfast Sunday, attended by his father, brother and about 500
supporters, showed that he seems to have a significant following
among the elderly.
   His campaign manager, Chris Nocera, mentioned that once, Kennedy
was talking to two elderly women who were quite distraught. He
consoled the women and told them to pray on the rosary, Nocera said.
   The religious strength, Kennedy said, is as much a part of him
as the Kennedy name and tradition. His grandmother, 98-year-old
Rose Kennedy, taught him to have his religious faith above all else
and if nothing else.
   ``They can't take that away from you,'' Kennedy said.

   Michael Dukakis, his stance on crime under a
new advertising attack from George Bush, is responding with a crime
ad of his own this week and also is airing a new commercial
promoting his leadership record.
   The new ads come at a time when the Dukakis advertising team is
taking on a new look, with the executive in charge of John Hancock
Insurance Co.'s communications efforts tapped to join the campaign
and coordinate its advertising efforts.
   The new Dukakis crime commercial, called ``Tough,'' will make
its debut later this week, according to Dukakis aides. It will
attempt to counter a new Bush commercial attacking Dukakis for
supporting a Massachusetts furlough program that, until amended
earlier this year, allowed passes to be approved for convicted
murderers sentenced to no-parole terms.
   The Bush ad began airing this week in California and Texas.
   ``Which candidate for president can you really count on to be
tough on crime?'' the announcer in the Bush ad asks. ``George
Bush.''
   Dukakis' crime ad discusses crime-related statistics during his
tenure as Massachusetts governor, including a 13 percent drop in
the state's crime rate over the past four years, a significant
increase in convictions and jailings of drug dealers and a 20
percent increase in the number of police in state law enforcement
agencies.
   ``Leadership. It's getting real results,'' the announcer in the
Dukakis ad concludes.
   The other new Dukakis ad, ``Responsibility,'' began its
nationwide airing Wednesday night.
   It also stresses the theme of leadership _ a line of attack
Dukakis has been using against Bush in recent campaign appearances.
   ``Michael Dukakis balanced 10 budgets in a row and still cut
taxes five times,'' the announcer in the 30-second
``Responsibility'' ad says.
   The ad also refers to the rate of personal income growth in
Massachusetts, which is twice the national average, and the
governor's successful effort to win passage of the first state law
guaranteeing health insurance to virtually all workers.
   ``That's why America's governors, both Democrat and Republican,
voted Michael Dukakis the most effective governor in the nation,''
the announcer says.
   Dukakis campaign aides declined to say how much the campaign was
spending on the new round of ads, to be supplemented by a new
commerical paid for by the Democratic National Committee.
   The naming of John Hancock's David D'Allesandro to head the
Dukakis ad team was characterized by several Dukakis aides as a key
move in an effort to bring more direction to advertising strategy.
   The move was orchestrated by John Sasso, the Dukakis confidant
who recently returned as vice chairman of the Democratic campaign,
said Dukakis media adviser Francis O'Brien.

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen found a piece of his past here, in the form of a
chunk of a B-24 bomber mounted on a hangar wall.
   Bentsen, in a campaign speech Wednesday at the Confederate Air
Force, reflected repeatedly on how the collection of restored World
War II planes brought back memories.
   Bentsen flew 34 missions in the War in Europe. Although there
were no B-24s on hand when he visited the CAF, there was a Vultee
BT-13 trainer, the same type the Texas senator used when he was
learning to fly.
   Shedding his suit coat for a leather jacket in the moist Texas
heat, the 67-year-old Bentsen climbed into the cockpit and fired it
up, waving from the open canopy as the wind from the prop blew back
his hair.
   ``I lost my favorite picture of my wife, and my wallet, flying
one of these things upside down with the canopy open in Alabama,''
he recalled.
   Bentsen then toured the hangar where several planes were in
various stages of restoration. Mounted on the wall were the sides
of old bombers carefully cut to preserve the cheesecake art work
that graced their flanks.
   Pin-up girls in various stages of undress had titles such as
``Night Mission,''``Surprise Attack'' and ``Target for Tonight.''
Asked what was on the side of his plane, Bentsen replied that he
was a squadron leader and often changed planes. ``One of them was
`Double Trouble.' Others I don't want to name,'' he chuckled.
   Bentsen strolled across the hangar to where the display
continued. And it stopped him dead in his tracks.
   There it was, right near ``Night Mission.''
   ``Double Trouble'' is a painting of twin nude, buxom women in a
swan-dive from the sky, their heads and shoulders back and
propellers spinning from their thrust-out chests.
   ``Well, I'll be damned,'' he said.
   Could it be from the same plane that Bentsen flew more than 43
years ago?
   ``It looks familiar,'' he said sheepishly.
   Later on his campaign plane, Bentsen said he couldn't be sure it
was the same one, but he was glad his wife, B.A., was campaigning
elsewhere at the time.

   Studying the crowds at political events isn't a very scientific
measure of how a candidate is doing. But it's a lot more
entertaining than political polls.
   Sometimes the reaction is more news than the candidate _ such as
when Bentsen was booed by the Veterans of Foreign Wars when he
mentioned the name of his running mate, Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis.
   Other times on the Bentsen campaign, the heckling and protest
signs seem less ominous and can be downright funny.
   ``Who the Hayle is Quayle?'' protested a placard-waving Iowan
when Bentsen spoke in Amana last week.
   Students at Virginia Tech from both sides of the political
spectrum came to hear him speak. It was hard to tell the fans from
the foes.
   ``Bimbo and Lloyd _ Go for the Gold,'' as one sign read, seemed
to imply indiscretions. But it was a compliment _ ``Bimbo'' being a
Virginia Tech star athlete on his way to the Olympics.
   ``Lloyd _ Dude,'' was a favorite of young Democrats while
``Avoid the Lloyd'' was brandished by the GOP troops. ``Political
Science Club Welcomes Sen. Bentsen'' was a sign that upheld
tradition.
   The audience at a rally near Detroit repeatedly called for
Bentsen to kiss his wife, B.A., while they snapped pictures. The
courtly Texan obliged, but Mrs. Bentsen confided later: ``He just
wanted to run from the room.''
   In the middle of a speech in San Diego, Bentsen was giving his
stock stump speech attacking President Reagan's veto of the trade
bill.
   ``And do you know why he vetoed that bill?'' he asked
rhetorically, pausing.
   ``Because he's a bum,'' shouted someone in the crowd.

   Wendell C. Phillippi, a retired major

telephone call to one person in behalf of the 1969 enlistment of
Sen. Dan Quayle, now the Republican nominee for vice president.
   The Associated Press reported on Aug. 18 that Phillippi had made
multiple calls in connection with Quayle's effort to join the
Guard. The Indianapolis News carried a story on Aug. 18 reporting
that Phillippi said he had called on his multitude of friends in
the Guard when Quayle sought enlistment.
   Later AP stories on Aug. 18 quoted Phillippi as saying that he
made only one call.
   In 1969, Phillippi was managing editor of The Indianapolis News.
The late Eugene C. Pulliam, Quayle's grandfather, was publisher of
the News. Phillippi had been commanding general of the 38th
Division, Indiana National Guard. He had retired from the Guard
prior to the Quayle enlistment.

   Polls inaugurating the fall presidential race
give the early advantage to George Bush, indicating he has seized
the agenda in the campaign's final stretch. But his lead, pollsters
warn, is tenuous.
   Surveys this week found Bush delineating key issues and boxing
Michael Dukakis into a defensive corner. Some put the race at a
tie; two polls found an eight-point Bush lead. On the issues,
analysts said, Bush was stronger.
   ``Bush has control of the agenda and he is setting the tone of
the campaign, at least for now,'' Kathleen A. Frankovic, pollster
for CBS News, said Wednesday. ``His attacks are hurting Dukakis.''
   But Frankovic and others said the very factors that allowed Bush
to turn the tables on Dukakis make his current lead precarious:
Voters' choices remain unusually tentative, making rapid changes
possible.
   ``It's all very volatile. It's still to be won or lost,'' said
Humphrey Taylor, president of Louis Harris & Associates. ``Even if
Bush was to go 10 or 12 points ahead, it would not mean he is
certain to win by any means.''
   Taylor cited two chief reasons: Voters are less tightly
constrained by party loyalty than ever before, and neither Bush nor
Dukakis has engendered either strong attachments or strong
antipathy.
   One measure was a Gallup poll this week that found just 38
percent of the voters with a strong preference for either
candidate. At this time in 1984, by contrast, 49 percent had strong
feelings for the nominees.
   And in this week's CBS News-New York Times poll, ``almost 40
percent of the voters are undecided or say their minds could still
change,'' Frankovic said. ``That's a lot of people.''
   Although Bush led Dukakis by eight points in the CBS-Times and
Gallup polls, the share of voters saying they strongly supported
the Republican was down in Gallup's survey, from 27 percent last
month to 21 percent now.
   ``He has widened the gap, but he has widened the gap with soft
support,'' said Larry Hugick, political pollster for the Gallup
Organization. ``So even though he has a wider lead over Dukakis, he
hasn't built a solid lead.''
   Unsettled opinions can make polls results more sensitive to
differing survey techniques. Los Angeles Times, CNN-USA Today and
Roper Organization polls released this week found statistical dead
heats, and the latest poll, an ABC News-Washington Post survey
conducted Sept. 7 through Tuesday, put the race at 48 percent for
Dukakis to 45 percent for Bush, another dead heat based on a margin
of error of 3 percent.
   More significant than any numerical advantage were gauges
indicating Bush has taken control of campaign issues. He outscored
Dukakis on defense and foreign policy, gained with the Pledge of
Allegiance issue, challenged the Democrat on the environment and
even won on competence, an issue Dukakis had sought to make his own.
   ``What we see in these latest surveys is a consequence of
relatively extensive campaigning by Bush ... and therefore more
press coverage,'' said Michael Traugott, another Gallup pollster.
``He has had success in elevating his visibility and in also
structuring the agenda discussed in the media.''
   Bush's approach in some cases has reached beyond the media to
the voters. An example is his criticism of Dukakis for vetoing a
bill requiring teachers to lead pupils in the Pledge. Three in 10
voters in the Gallup poll said they liked Dukakis less for his
handling of the issue, and the CBS-Times poll also found support
for Bush's position.
   Bush also showed gains with his ideological assault on Dukakis:
Only 15 percent in the CBS-Times poll called themselves liberals,
the lowest share in more than a decade, while 37 percent called
Dukakis a liberal.
   The Gallup poll found that Bush's support was based more on
policy agreement and less on party loyalty than was Dukakis',
another sign that Bush's message has worked to greater effect. And
the polls gave Dukakis his highest unfavorable ratings of the
campaign.
   Although the surveys indicated a reversal of fortunes for
Dukakis, who led by as many as 18 points less than two months ago,
pollsters stressed that the race could swing again _ either on
tactical moves or on events such as the debates scheduled for next
month.
   ``Bush has the edge, but there is plenty of volatility here,''
said Hugick, the Gallup pollster. ``Until we see a firming up of
the vote, we have to be very cautious about reading too much into
that lead.''

<HEAD>Thousands Return To Chicago Church To View `Weeping' Icon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Costandini Cosma says her eyesight was so poor
she could hardly see, before the Virgin Mary began ``weeping'' at
St. Nicholas Albanian Orthodox Church. Now, her eyes feel much
better.
   ``I believe,'' the 74-year-old parishoner said Wednesday.
   She believes the icon that appears to be shedding tears rewards
those who have faith. And like thousands of others, she has stood
in line for hours to get a look at what St. Nicholas' pastor calls
a ``phenomenon, a miraculous sign.''
   It's the second time the icon shows wet streaks under the eyes.
The first time started in December 1986 and lasted seven months,
attracting millions to the small, 17-pew church on Chicago's
Northwest Side.
   Last week, a man who entered the church to pray spotted the
streaks.
   ``We had just finished a prayer service and I was in the banquet
hall,'' said the Rev. Philip Koufos, the pastor. ``He came running
in saying he saw something strange in the eyes.
   ``We feel very blessed,'' said Koufos. ``The mother of God is
saying `I'm still with you.'''
   The church is open only three days a week, and despite the
interest in the icon, Koufos says he has no plans to extend the
hours as he did in 1987.
   So at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday, the line starts
at the altar rail and snakes to the back of church, through the
vestibule and into the adjacent banquet hall.
   When the viewer gets to the rail, the icon hangs about 10 feet
away behind a plexiglass shield. An usher helps visitors get the
best angle to see what Koufos calls the ``trickles of tears.''
   After a few seconds, another viewer steps up.
   ``People sometimes go around a number of times,'' Koufos said.
``Some stay in the church for hours.
   ``They come for all sorts of reasons,'' he added. ``Some come
looking for consolation, contrition, out of curiosity _ for every
possible reason. Some are looking for cures.''
   The queue has parents carrying children, people toting Bibles
and the devout clutching basil leaves, an Albanian Orthodox
practice. All bear a desire to witness what most consider a bizarre
yet pious mystery.
   ``I believe it,'' said Eleanor Chiczewski of Elmwood Park. ``I
need help. I came here hoping she could help me. I'm Roman Catholic
but it's God, Jesus and Mary; it's all the same.''
   Patricia Slove, 22, of Chicago considers the tears a miracle.
   ``When I came here I saw a streak,'' she said. ``On TV I saw a
stream of water. Maybe she was crying harder then. It's a mystery
to me. Why is there glass in front of her? Is it for reflection?
You can't study it. They move you right along.''
   Dorothy Duke of Niagara, Wis., stopped at the church while
visiting her sister.
   ``Not for any deep faith experience,'' Ms. Duke, 54, explained.
``But I had hoped to feel a little different. Maybe I'll come
back.''
   A collection basket is kept at the rear of church and all
donations go to the poor, Koufos said. Many people drop dollar
bills at the altar rail after viewing the icon.
   In 1987, when the tears lasted more than half the year, an
archbishop of the Eastern Orthodox faith visited the church and
pronounced the weeping an ``inexplicable sign'' of religious
importance.
   Koufos says the icon's significance is mostly personal,
determined by the people who pass through the church.
   ``I see miracles all the time on people's faces. It's
beautiful,'' he said. ``I feel the mother of God is preparing us,
strengthening us for something. It's a very positive thing.''

<DATELINE>MASERU, Lesotho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thanks to a rainstorm, two broken radio
beacons and a pilot who didn't want to take chances, Pope John Paul
II got a glimpse of the one country he was trying to avoid during
his tour of southern Africa.
   In his next unplanned adventure Wednesday, the 68-year-old
pontiff was escorted by soldiers and police on an improvised
270-mile drive from South Africa to Lesotho, where a bus hostage
drama was unfolding at the site of the high point of his pilgrimage.
   The pope's strange odyssey began 75 minutes after takeoff from
Gaborone, Botswana, when the Air Zimbabwe Boeing 707 taking him to
tiny Lesotho, an enclave surrounded by South Africa, gave up
efforts to land at the airport in Maseru.
   Circling and bumping in clouds so thick they covered the
wingtips, the airliner, carrying reporters and the papal party,
veered west at 7,600 feet over Maseru and climbed back to cruising
altitude.
   ``It's Johannesburg,'' announced Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro, walking to the back of the plane.
   ``In the not too distant future,'' Navarro added jokingly,
making a change in the advance text of a papal speech in which the
pontiff said he was looking forward to visiting South Africa soon.
   In the prepared address, which was to have been delivered
Wednesday afternoon in Lesotho, the pope said he was confident that
``all those in a position of responsibility will continue to
promote a climate that will make such a visit truly fruitful for
all the people of South Africa.''
   The pope is a vocal opponent of South Africa's policies of
apartheid, under which the country's black majority has no say in
national affairs.
   Navarro said the pope, who was reading a book of philosophy when
informed of the flight change, smiled and remarked: ``This was not
on the schedule.''
   After nearly two hours, the plane landed at Jan Smuts Airport
outside Joahnnesburg, and Capt. Robin Cartwright, a Zimbabwean,
provided an explanation over the loudspeaker.
   Cartwright said he found out after takeoff that the two radio
beacons at Maseru airport were out of order. Any descent without
instrument assistance to the airport, situated in a bowl surrounded
by mountains of 3,000-4,000 feet, would have been perilous, he said.
   The pilot had told reporters the night before that he had never
landed at Maseru.
   Cartwright said he first considered Maputo, the capital of
Mozambique, which the pope will visit Friday, as well as Manzini,
in Swaziland, but both were also plagued by bad weather.
   The Gaborone airport was reporting worsening weather, and the
only airport with safe landing facilities nearby, as the fuel level
was dropping, was Johannesburg, he said.
   In the meantime, South African officials, who in August had
unsuccessfully suggested the pope celebrate a Mass during a
``technical stopover'' at Jan Smuts midway through the five-nation
trip, quickly moved into action.
   Security forces with telescopic rifles and machine guns
surrounded the Boeing 707. Foreign Minister Pik Botha rushed from
Pretoria to the plane for a formal greeting and a tea-sipping
briefing with the pope in the VIP lounge to discuss the evolving
hijack drama in Lesotho.
   In a noticeable departure from custom, John Paul did not kiss
the ground in Johannesburg, and he made no public statements there.
   After less than three hours in Johannesburg, authorities had
rounded up a dark bullet-proof limousine, three buses and six
white-and-orange traffic police cars with flashing lights and
sirens for the 270-mile drive to Lesotho.
   Helicopters whirred over the convoy while roads and highways
were sealed off by soldiers or police along the way in an
astonishing display of military organization as the convoy first
skirted the skyscrapers of Johannesburg, then sped through the
prairies of the Orange Free State.
   After dark, the convoy crossed a narrow bridge over the Caledeon
River into Lesotho, and John Paul was greeted by hundreds of people
wrapped in traditional multicolored blankets, ululating in
high-pitched shrieks of welcome.
   The pope arrived in Maseru just 20 minutes before police stormed
a bus loaded with nuns and other pilgrims that had been hijacked by
gunmen who demanded to meet John Paul and Lesotho's king.
   Authorities said three hijackers and a hostage were killed in
the action, which ended a two-day hostage crisis.

   Fugitive slumlord Vijaynand Sharma was
arrested in New Jersey on Wednesday after he fled to avoid fines
and a jail term for 112 counts of health, building and safety code
violations at his tenements, officials said.
   Sharma, 42, of Inglewood, was arrested by FBI agents in Cherry
Hill, N.J., said Los Angeles FBI special agent Jim Neilson.
   The notorious slumlord, whose tenants complained of vermin
infestation, faulty plumbing, exposed electrical wiring and
inoperable fire hoses, waived extradition and is expected to be
returned to Los Angeles as soon as possible, said Deputy City
Attorney Stephanie Sautner.
   Sharma was charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution on
Feb. 1 and U.S. Magistrate Volney Brown in Los Angeles issued a
federal fugitive warrant.
   He was also sought for failure to appear for sentencing and a
probation violation in connection with a December 1987 fire at one
of his buildings. He violated parole when he failed to fix fire
safety equipment.
   The warrants carried a total of $2.9 million bail.
   Ms. Sautner said Sharma faces a jail term of nearly two years on
current charges. City Attorney James Hahn said Sharma faces
prosecution in eight other slum cases.
   Sharma has lived in the United States for the past two decades.
He was convicted Nov. 19, 1987 on a 112-count conviction in what
was called the city's biggest prosecution on slum conditions.
   He disappeared some time after Dec. 21, 1987 when he was freed
on bail so he could appeal a 90-day jail term imposed in one of
several cases of violations at his 18 dilapidated apartment
buildings and residential hotels.

   The University of Washington temporarily stopped
cutting down trees on campus after the buzzing of chain saws
brought howls of protest from students, faculty and others.
   ``We had a nice grove of trees there,'' Roger Soder, special
assistant to the dean of the College of Education, said of the
Husky Student Union yard where 65 tall trees were chopped down.
   ``People are just shocked and genuinely hurt when they see what
is going on.''
   Of the 81 trees targeted, 65 were cut down and 10 were
transplanted. The removal of six others was blocked by protesters
Wednesday, said university spokesman Bob Roseth.
   The trees were being removed to clear the area for a $36 million
five-story expansion of the university's main library. About 200
new trees will be planted, Roseth said.
   A private, informational meeting with protesters was set for
today, after which Roseth said he expected work to resume.

<HEAD>Legislation To Clean Up Rio Grande One Step Away From
Congressional Passage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sponsor of legislation authorizing the
United States to negotiate with Mexico over cleaning up the Rio
Grande says he's optimistic the Mexican government will support
stopping the large-scale dumping of raw sewage.
   The bill cleared the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
Wednesday. If passed by the full Senate without amendment it would
go to President Reagan for his signature.
   Rep. E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas, author of the bill _
which passed the House last fall _ said he met with officials in
Mexico a week ago and they assured him of their cooperation.
   His counterparts in Mexico ``expressed an interest and will be
recommending positive action on an agreement to both the incoming
and outgoing presidents. As soon as passage, I hope within 60 days
to have ready for presentation (a cleanup proposal) to the
president of Mexico. Hopefully Nuevo Laredo will be the first
project,'' de la Garza said.
   Under the bill, the State Department, acting through the head of
the U.S. International Boundary Water Commission, would negotiate
with Mexican officials to find ways to clean up the Rio Grande and
make recommendations on building treatment facilities.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said 25 million gallons of raw
sewage is dumped daily into the Rio Grande at Nuevo Laredo, across
the border from Laredo, Texas.
   ``The large volume of raw sewage, garbage and industrial wastes
routinely dumped into the river has so polluted the Rio Grande that
it will take unusual and substantial efforts to sanitize it,''
Bentsen said in a statement.
   ``The most distressing problem is that every day, at several
points along the border, tens of millions of gallons of raw,
untreated sewage is dumped into the river,'' Bentsen said.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, called the bill ``a solid first step''
although he had sought a more comprehensive approach.

<TEXT>
   FBI Director William Sessions says top bureau
officials will face disciplinary action if there are more abuses of
the kinds that occurred in a terrorism probe of opponents of the
Reagan administration's Central American policy.
   Sessions disciplined six lower- and mid-level bureau personnel
Wednesday. But he told the Senate Intelligence Committee that
``under the procedures that were ... in place at the time,''
higher-level officials ``had no reasonable way to know'' the bureau
was collecting information on administration opponents whose
activities had nothing to do with terrorism.
   During the probe of the Committee in Solidarity with the People
of El Salvador, ``there was no requirement that higher level
officials be advised when certain investigative activities ... were
being used,'' said Sessions.
   He said the activities include surveillances at public rallies
and attendance at meetings.
   In the future, he said, higher-level officials will be required
to determine whether a particular investigation merits the use of
techniques that have the potential for infringing on constitutional
rights.
   Sources familiar with the action by Sessions identified five of
those being disciplined as Gary Penrith, deputy assistant director
of the FBI's intelligence division and former assistant special
agent in charge of the Dallas FBI office; Stanley Klein, special
agent in charge of the New Haven, Conn., office and former head of
the terrorism section at FBI headquarters; George Van Balen, chief
of the international terrorism-global unit at FBI headquarters in
Washington; Ronald Davenport, a supervisory special agent in the
Washington headquarters; and Parks Stearns, a supervisory special
agent in Dallas. Another supervisory agent in Washington also was
disciplined.
   Sessions said that under revamped procedures, in the future ``I
would think'' high-level personnel would face discipline if similar
problems arise.
   The investigation of allegations that leaders of a group in the
United States were supporting terrorism in Central America was
unnecessarily broadened in October 1983 to encompass all 180
chapters of the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El
Salvador, Sessions testified.
   He said there were 178 spin-off investigations from the CISPES
probe focusing on nine other groups and 169 people. The CISPES
investigation and spin-off probes ended in June 1985, a year after
the bureau concluded that its main informant in the case, Frank
Varelli, was unreliable.
   ``The CISPES investigation was an aberration ... an unfortunate
aligning of mistakes in judgment at several levels that
cumulatively led to an investigation of which the FBI is not
proud,'' Sessions said.
   ``There was no reason to believe that all CISPES members
nationwide knew of or had any involvement in support of El
Salvadoran or U.S. terrorists,'' testified Sessions. The decision
to widen the investigation ``was made at a comparatively low level
and ... supervisory personnel at FBI headquarters who should have
reviewed and analyzed this decision and appreciated its
significance failed to do so.''
   He called for a redrafting of the attorney general's guidelines
on international terrorism investigations, which he said don't
describe the extent to which leaders and rank-and-file members of
groups in the United States may be investigated.
   He said that in the CISPES probe ``the most critical area
requiring attention was how to conduct investigation of groups
where legitimate First Amendment activities were being undertaken
by the rank-and-file members.''
   Sessions instructed additional training for agents on how to
deal with activities protected by the First Amendment.

<HEAD>Army Officer Charged With Theft of 201 Guns</HEAD>

   An Army officer formerly responsible for
procuring guns for his unit was charged Wednesday with stealing 201
rifles, shotguns and handguns, according to a federal indictment
men.
   Maj. Michael Lynn Smith, 42, stole weapons worth $60,000 between
1981 and 1983, apparently for his gun collection, said U.S.
Attorney Joe Brown.
   The weapons include .44 Magnum revolvers, .22-caliber rifles,
9-millimeter pistols, 20-gauge shotguns, Remington bolt-action
rifles and various rifles with scopes, Brown said.
   Smith is chief of the family support division at Fort Campbell,
on the Kentucky border near Clarksville.
   He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted on the five-count
indictment handed down by a federal grand jury.
   The indictment accuses Smith of stealing the guns during his
1981-84 tour of duty as an adjutant to the Intelligence Support
Activity, a Virginia military support unit.
   Smith allegedly made out false vouchers for the money spent on
firearms and kept those not delivered to the unit. Brown said the
statute of limitations has run out on charging Smith with
submitting false documents.
   Brown said Smith agreed to report to U.S. marshals in Nashville
this week.
   The charges against Smith include interstate transportation of
stolen goods, because he allegedly took 201 weapons with him when
he was transferred to Fort Campbell in 1986.
   He also faces charges of possessing a silencer and retaining
stolen goods.

<HEAD>Tougher Provisions Being Added to Anti-Drug Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House anti-drug initiative is moving toward
a zero tolerance policy, as lawmakers tack on amendments that
stiffen penalties for recreational drug use.
   The House sent its latest message to drug users Wednesday,
passing an amendment that would subject anyone possessing
``personal use'' amounts of illegal drugs to civil penalties of
$10,000 per violation.
   The vote was 293-115, with 128 Democrats and 165 Republicans
supporting the proposal. There were 112 Democrats and three
Republicans in opposition.
   As House members began wading through changes to the drug bill
last week, they signaled that any drug use was intolerable. In the
first test of this policy, lawmakers voted 335-67 for an amendment
that would deny many federal benefits to those convicted of two
drug offenses, including possession.
   Still to come is a proposal that would deny states a portion of
their federal highway money if they fail to take away drivers'
licenses of those convicted of one drug offense. The initial
conviction would bring a six-month suspension, while repeat
convictions within a five-year period could bring revocation for a
year.
   ``The theme of this year's drug bill is user accountability,''
Rep. Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y., said in support of the civil fines
amendment sponsored by Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla.
   The overall anti-drug legislation would add some $2 billion to
the $3.9 billion federal effort to combat illegal drugs. It
includes money and programs for law enforcement, education,
treatment, rehabilitation and virtually every other avenue to try
to stem both the supply of drugs and demand for them.
   The House likely will complete the legislation next week. The
Senate has yet to begin consideration of its own major anti-drug
bill.
   The civil fines envisioned in the Edwards amendment would not
replace current criminal penalties for possessing marijuana,
cocaine or other drugs. The Justice Department would set the
amounts of drugs that would trigger the civil penalty.
   In the major difference between civil and criminal cases, a
defendant in a civil proceeding needs only to be found guilty by
``clear and convincing evidence.'' This is a far easier burden for
the government than the ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' standard it
must prove in a criminal case.
   In assessing the penalties, the Justice Department would take
into account an individual's income and net assets.
   After a penalty was proposed, the defendant could ask for an
administrative hearing and also could appeal to a federal court.
   The Reagan administration coined the term ``zero tolerance'' to
emphasize its policy that drug possession is as unacceptable as
drug dealing.
   Supporters of the civil fines said their amendment was needed to
enforce such a policy, because overburdened prosecutors and
overcrowded prisons cannot handle criminal cases involving
``personal use'' possession cases.
   ``Nobody thinks it's worth taking them to court,'' Edwards said,
calling the amendment a response to ``a sense of frustration in
America _ the inability of our criminal courts to effectively stop
drug use.''
   Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J., chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on crime, opposed the amendment, saying it would
either have the effect of decriminalizing drug possession or
abandoning the criminal justice system.
   ``We've told our children possessing drugs is a crime,'' he
said. ``What message are we sending in the Edwards approach? It's a
confusing signal. We are saying it's an administrative matter.''

<HEAD>New Book: Removal of Reagan From Office Suggested to Baker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House aides believed President Reagan
was so depressed and inattentive in the midst of the Iran-Contra
scandal that the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment to
remove him was raised to former chief of staff Howard Baker Jr.,
the Los Angeles Times reported.
   Former White House aide James Cannon, confirming reports in a
new book, said in an interview Wednesday that he wrote a March 1,
1987, memorandum on the aides' concerns.
   The amendment, added to the Constitution in 1967, provides the
President may be removed if the vice president and a majority of
the Cabinet declare him ``unable to discharge the powers and duties
of his office.''
   Baker, with Cannon and two of his own aides, spent part of a day
observing Reagan before concluding the president was competent to
perform his duties, according to the book.
   Baker later said that, even though he accepted Cannon's concerns
as legitimate, he never seriously considered invoking the 25th
Amendment.
   ``I didn't take Cannon's memo lightly,'' Baker said in the
interview, ``but, from the first time I saw him Reagan, he was
fully in control and I never had any question about his mental
competence.''
   The White House refused to comment, the Times reported.
   The existence of Cannon's memo is reported in ``Landslide: The
Unmaking of the President, 1984-88,'' by Jane Mayer, a Wall Street
Journal reporter who covered the Reagan White House, and Doyle
McManus, a Los Angeles Times reporter who has covered the
Iran-Contra scandal.
   Even more chilling, was the portrait that White House aides drew
of Reagan himself, Cannon told the authors of ``Landslide.''
   ``They told stories about how inattentive and inept the
President was. He was lazy; he wasn't interested in the job. They
said he wouldn't read the papers they gave him _ even short
position papers and documents. They said he wouldn't come over to
work _ all he wanted to do was to watch movies and television at
the residence.''
   Cannon told The Times that he interviewed 15 to 20 White House
officials, including senior aides, and ``the overwhelming
majority'' painted that portrait.
   ``Landslide'' reports that Baker, on the weekend before becoming
chief of staff early in 1987, sent longtime aides Cannon and Thomas
Griscom to look into reports of White House disorder in the wake of
the Iran-Contra scandal.
   Cannon and Griscom were shocked by what they found. ``Chaos,''
Cannon reported in his memo to Baker.
   Cannon, who had served as an aide to Vice President Nelson A.
Rockefeller and as domestic policy adviser to President Gerald R.
Ford, that he began his memo to the incoming chief of staff with
this startling recommendation:
   ``1. Consider the possibility that section four of the 25th
Amendment might be applied.''
   At a meeting in the White House on March 2, Baker, Cannon,
Griscom and Baker aide A.B. Culvahouse bracketed Reagan at the
Cabinet table so they could watch his every move. To Cannon's
surprise, Reagan seemed attentive and alert, charming and glib _
the same Ronald Reagan he had known for years.

<HEAD>Democrats Urge Bush To Support Sanctions Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats are calling on Republican
presidential candidate George Bush to reverse course and support
strong economic sanctions legislation against white-dominated South
Africa.
   Just barely overcoming solid opposition from Republican members,
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent the sanctions bill to
the full Senate on Wednesday on a 10-9 party line vote.
   The bill would impose a trade embargo against South Africa and
require the withdrawal of most U.S. business investment until that
nation ends its apartheid system of forced racial separation.
   A much milder sanctions bill was passed over President Reagan's
veto two years ago. But the Republicans who supported that step
apparently will refuse to embrace the present legislation.
   Republicans have insisted Democrats are pushing sanctions
legislation in an election year to gain political advantage for
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., quickly moved to cast the issue
in political terms and called for Bush to support the bill.
   ``We're not trying to embarrass the Republicans; they are
embarrassing themselves and embarrassing the United States as
well,'' Kennedy told reporters.
   Kennedy said Bush has undergone a number of ``election-year
conversions'' during the campaign, citing the candidate's
apparently changed positions on day care and increasing the minimum
wage.
   ``We have welcomed these election-year conversions on the part
of Mr. Bush,'' Kennedy said. ``We would certainly welcome his
support on this measure. He has indicated he wanted to broaden his
mandate. He now has an excellent opportunity to speak to that
measure. We're asking for his help and support on this issue.''
   Bush has opposed sanctions as unlikely to bring change in South
Africa and as a step that would remove all U.S. influence on the
South African government. The 1988 Democratic platform labels South
Africa a ``terrorist state'' and Dukakis has supported a sanctions
policy.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., a principal author of the
sanctions bill, told reporters that if Republicans maintain a solid
front against the measure it will be difficult to cut off a
threatened filibuster against it or to override a near-certain veto
by Reagan should it clear the Senate.
   So far, only one Republican, Sen. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut,
has announced support for the sanctions measure.
   Cranston said the Senate's Democratic leadership might consider
attaching the sanctions bill as an amendment to some other
legislation in an effort to assure there is a recorded Senate vote
on sanctions before Congress adjourns next month.
   Asked about the prospects for the bill, Cranston replied: ``I'm
hopeful, but I make no predictions until I ascertain that we have a
solid Republican Party against this action. ... If discipline is
enforced on Republican senators, we have a problem.''
   The bill would force American companies to withdraw from South
Africa six months to a year after its enactment. It imposes a ban
on exports to and imports from South Africa, with the exception of
a list of strategic minerals.

<HEAD>Memory Enhancing Medicine Developed, Could Help Alzheimer's
Victims</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A memory enhancing medicine derived from a
Chinese plant has been reproduced in U.S. laboratories and holds
promise for the senile and victims of Alzheimer's disease,
scientists say.
   ``This is not a cure,'' cautioned Alan P. Kozikowski, professor
of chemistry and behavioral neuroscience at the University of
Pittsburgh.
   ``It's one hurdle in the path to trying to find something that
can be used in treating this disease and helping to alleviate some
of the symptoms.''
   For centuries, the Chinese have brewed tea from the leaves of
the plant, Huperzia serrata, and served it to the elderly to
improve their memory.
   In 1986, scientists at China's Shanghai Institute of Materia
Medica isolated the specific compound in the plant responsible for
improving memory. Since then, U.S. researchers have been trying to
synthesize the compound, an alkaloid known as huperzine A.
   Kozikowski said he succeeded last week.
   ``The synthesis is particularly important because we can attempt
to improve on nature. We should be able to make something better in
terms of its ability to get into the brain and work on specific
enzyme systems,'' he said.
   Zaven Khachaturian, director of the National Institute on
Aging's office of Alzheimer's disease research, said Kozikowski's
discovery is encouraging.
   ``Anything that's done on this type of identification of plant
material to improve memory would make a significant contribution to
Alzheimer's disease, said Khachaturian, whose agency is financing
Kozikowski's research.
   ``The disease is such a devastating disease. If you can keep
somebody out of the hospital for even six months or a year, it's a
major achievement.''
   An estimated 2.5 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's, and
most are older than 60, according to the Alzheimer's Association.
About 100,000 people die annually as a result of the disease.
   There is no known cause or cure for the progressive,
degenerative illness, which attacks the brain and results in
impaired memory, thinking and behavior. Researchers suspect as
culprits genetic predisposition, virus or other infectious agents
and environmental toxins.
   A new experimental drug to help Alzheimer's patients, known as
tetrahydroaminoacridine, or THA, is being tested at 16 U.S.
research centers. Preliminary results of the drug's safety and
effectiveness are expected early next year, Khachaturian said.
   Kozikowski said huperzine A, like THA, blocks the enzyme
responsible for breaking down a primary neurotransmitter in the
brain known as acetylcholine. This neurotransmitter is deficient in
Alzheimer's patients, whose brain cells gradually die.
   ``To enable a cell on the verge of dying to live longer or
function normally, even for a brief period, that's a tremendous
gain,'' Khachaturian said.
   ``You help the neurotransmitter that's left there to work a
little bit better, help alleviate symptoms,'' Kozikowski said. ``In
many cases, that's the best one can hope for.''
   While more potent than THA, huperzine A appears to be less toxic
and remains active longer in the brain, Kozikowski said. Side
effects of THA include dizziness and nausea, also present in
huperzine A but in lesser amounts.
   China's natural plant compound has been tested there on 200
people with impaired memories, according to Kozikowski. The Chinese
reported the subjects' memories improved significantly.
   Improvements also were reported in tests on rats and monkeys in
the United States and Switzerland.
   The synthesized compound will be tested in this country on rats
and other animals before being tried on humans, said Kozikowski.
   Kozikowski is synthesizing other compounds that he said one day
may help prevent Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and
other neurodegenerative disorders and even improve the memory of
healthy individuals.
   ``It sounds a little bit like fantasy,'' he said. ``But there's
good reason to imagine you can do this.''

<HEAD>Navy Blames Pilot Judgment for Shooting Down Air Force Jet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One year after a Navy F-14 Tomcat shot down an
Air Force reconnaissance jet, the Navy released an investigative
report that blames the accident on a ``basic error in judgment''
and ``an illogical act'' by the young fighter pilot.
   The report, recently declassified under the terms of the Freedom
of Information Act, was obtained Wednesday. It tracks the findings
of a previously released Air Force inquiry into the Sept. 22, 1987,
loss of an RF-4C reconnaissance jet over the Mediterranean Sea.
   The two Air Force crewmen managed to eject and parachute to
safety, but their twin-engine jet blew up and was lost at sea. It
was shot out of the sky by an F-14 assigned to the carrier Saratoga.
   Like his Air Force counterpart, the Navy investigating officer _
Capt. J.W. Lovell _ concluded the Navy and Air Force aviators had
been engaged in a routine exercise right up to the second the
F-14's pilot armed and fired a live Sidewinder missile.
   The pilot, Lt. j.g. Timothy W. Dorsey, was 25 at the time and a
rookie fighter pilot with just 245 hours of flight time in the F-14.
   Lovell found that even though Dorsey earlier that day had
concluded the RF-4C was a ``friendly'' plane and knew he was on an
exercise, he reacted to a radio command from his carrier
authorizing a simulated attack by doing the real thing.
   ``The September 22, 1987, destruction of USAF RF-4C ... was not
the result of an accident, but the consequence of a deliberate
act,'' the investigator wrote. ``His (Dorsey's) subsequent reaction
(to the radio command) demonstrated an absolute disregard of the
known facts and circumstances.
   ``He failed to utilize the decision-making process taught in
replacement training and reacted in a purely mechanical manner. The
performance of Lieutenant Timothy W. Dorsey on September 22, 1987,
raises substantial doubt as to his capacity for good, sound
judgment.''
   The investigator's findings were accepted by Rear Adm. Jeremy
Boorda, who ordered the inquiry.
   ``The investigating officer and endorsers of this investigation
are faced with attempting to precisely determine the reason for
what amounts to an illogical act,'' Boorda, who was then the
commander of Cruiser-Destroyer Group Eight, said in a statement
accompanying the report.
   ``What remains is an act by a pilot who for a moment left the
exercise world he was a part of, and reacted in a rote manner to
what he perceived as an order to actually destroy an aircraft that
moments before he believed to be a friendly.''
   Vice Adm. Kendall E. Moranville, until last month the head of
the U.S. 6th Fleet, agreed: ``We necessarily rely on the
self-discipline and judgment of pilots to prevent such incidents;
we have no other choice. Nothing, in my opinion, can mitigate
Lieutenant Dorsey's basic error in judgment.''
   Dorsey was transferred to a job ashore after the incident and
disciplined with an order that will prevent him from ever flying a
Navy plane again.
   The investigative report and written ``endorsements'' up the
chain of command also disclose that in the wake of the accident,
the Navy ordered F-14 pilots to verbally advise their radar
intercept officers whenever they have armed the plane's weapons.
   The radar intercept officer flying with Dorsey didn't know the
pilot had actually armed his missiles and was no longer just
pretending to shoot.
   The report further shows that new steps were taken in the wake
of the affair to ensure that Navy fighters wouldn't be launched off
carriers for war games with Air Force jets carrying live weapons.
   The Navy already had a directive in place to that effect, and
Moranville faulted the top officers of the Saratoga ``for the
failure to comply with the clear terms of the exercise operations
order.''

   Republican presidential nominee George Bush
wooed Hispanic and Asian voters Wednesday with a pitch on
patriotism and a declaration that ``only one man can carry
America's peace and prosperity into the 1990s.''
   At a colorful rally in a Chinatown park, Bush said, ``I am here
to tell you that I am that man.''
   A noisy band of demonstrators heckled the vice president,
chanting ``down with Bush'' and carrying signs opposing offshore
oil drilling. Bush's supporters far outnumbered the protesters.
   The crowd included a Buddhist monk described as ``the great
master,'' who blessed Bush. There also were young men dressed in
costumes of yellow and red dancing dragons. They were accompanied
by youths whose drums and cymbals helped drown out the protesters.
   But at Union Square across the luxury St. Francis hotel where
Bush was to deliver a speech, about 400 demonstrators gathered.
Some pushed over police barricades, spilling out into the street,
stopping automobile traffic and the city's famed cable cars.
   The protesters chanted ``Where's George'' and ``Money for AIDS,
stop the war, U.S. out of El Salvador.'' Police said at least one
person was arrested.
   At a $1,000-per-person fund-raiser Tuesday night, Bush said the
United States should seek continued economic prosperity for reasons
other than riches. ``It is legitimate to ask what is the end
purpose of economic growth. Is it just to be rich? What a shallow
ambition. Is there really any satisfaction to be had in being the
fattest country?''
   He said prosperity would bring ``greater strides in the arts and
sciences and things of the spirit but it also means just giving a
helping hand to a fellow citizen who needs it.''
   In unusually poetic comments, Bush attempted to elaborate on his
vow to make America ``a kinder, gentler nation.'' He told the
gathering he is ``almost haunted by the lives being lead by the
children of our inner cities.'' But he said government can't solve
their problems and that he hoped as president he could be ``a
gentle persuader to rally our people to help our children.''
   Bush began the day campaigning at a Mexican restaurant in Los
Angeles and then flew to the San Joaquin Valley to visit the
Sun-Maid Growers cooperative of raisin producers.
   In Los Angeles, he credited the Reagan administration with
restoring pride in the United States and said sales of American
flags have been booming since the Democrats left the White House.
   In Chinatown, Democrats distributed fortune cookies with
messages reading, ``Vote Dukakis'' and ``Where Was George'' _ a
refrain made popular at the Democratic National Convention.
   Using a similar tactic, Bush's hosts gave him a huge fortune
cookie with a message reading, ``November brings good fortune.'
   Bush said the election poses a key choice. ``You can choose to
keep going with the policies that have launched the longest period
of economic growth in history or you can choose to go backwards,''
he said.
   ``And you can choose a candidate with experience and leadership
to keep democracy on the move or you can choose one who lacks
experience in foreign affairs,'' Bush said. ``Only one man is
pledged to build a better America through low taxes and high
opportunity, and only one man wants laws against crime, tougher
laws, and creative programs for our schools.
   ``Only one person _ only one person can carry America's peace
and prosperity into the 1990s.''
   Earlier, Bush tried to win votes from farmers and growers in the
Central Valley. Bush said he opposed the grape boycott, which has
been led by Cesar Chavez to protest alleged exposure of workers to
pesticides, and he expressed support for a trade complaint filed
against Japan by rice millers. He said Dukakis supports the boycott.
   With 47 electoral votes at stake in California, Bush set his
sights on large Hispanic and Asian populations, two swing-voter
groups that could determine the outcome of the state's close
presidential race.
   Before a Hispanic audience in Los Angeles, Bush said, ``Nobody
can tell us we can't get the job done.''
   He said there was ``new pride in America, demonstrated by the
performance of a flag-making company in New Jersey.''
   Without identifying the flag manufacturer, Bush said its flag
sales have ``taken off'' after doing poorly under Jimmy Carter's
Democratic administration.
   Craig Fuller, the vice president's chief of staff, denied that
Bush was questioning Dukakis' patriotism.
   After complaints from Dukakis about the vice president's jibes
about patriotism and the Pledge of Allegiance, Bush has frequently
said on the campaign trail that he was not questioning his
opponent's patriotism, merely his judgment. Bush omitted that line
in Los Angeles.
   Stressing a theme of economic prosperity, Bush said nearly 18
million new jobs have been created during the Reagan administration
and that unemployment has been cut to 5.6 percent.
   He said Hispanics have shared in the good news with an
employment rate growing at three times the rate of that for the
entire labor force. He said unemployment among Hispanics has fallen
almost twice as fast under President Reagan as it did when
Democrats were in the White House.
   Moreover, Bush said per capita income for Hispanic Americans,
adjusted for inflation, rose 13 percent between 1980 and 1987,
rising annually since the economic recovery began after falling
during the Carter administration.
   Later, standing in a field in the San Joaquin Valley, surrounded
by crates of raisins, oranges, peaches and grapes, Bush cited new
trade figures showing that the trade deficit fell to a smaller than
expected $9.53 billion in July.

<TEXT>
   The State Department is accusing Nicaragua's
leftist government of a cynical political move by suspending a
$17.7 million U.S. program to aid Nicaraguan children who have been
orphaned or injured as a result of civil war.
   Spokesman Charles Redman rebuked Sandinista authorities
Wednesday after they served notice that the program will not be
allowed to continue at a time when the Congress is considering a
new aid program for the Contra rebels.
   In Managua, President Danel Ortega said it doesn't make sense to
receive aid from the same body that is considering an assistance
package to the very group responsible for the plight of Nicaragua's
children, according to Nicaraguan Embassy spokeswoman Sarali Porta.
   U.S. private groups were told the suspension would become
permanent if Congress approves additional assistance to replace an
aid package that expires at the end of this month. A $27 million
humanitarian assistance bill approved by the Senate is awaiting
House action.
   Redman said it is ``deplorable that Sandinista government has
chosen to sacrifice the well-being of Nicaragua's children in an
effort to pressure the United States Congress.''
   He said that although the Sandinistas have never fully
cooperated with this humanitarian program, ``it would be tragic if
they persist in this cynical effort to play politics with the
health and well-being of Nicaraguan children.''
   Ms. Porta said her government does not draw a major distinction
between military and humanitarian aid. She said the latter keeps
the rebels alive, enabling them to pursue the war effort.
   After the Sandinistas and the Contras reached an interim
cease-fire agreement last March, Congress approved a $48 million
aid package, $17.7 million of which was to be used to assist needy
or disabled Nicaraguan children.
   Most of the rest of the package was in the form of food,
clothing, shelter and medical care for the insurgents.
   Redman said that since April 1, the Agency for International
Development has authorized more than $12 million in new health
programs for Nicaraguan children. About $2.7 million has been spent
for medical supplies.
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State George P. Shultz met Wednesday
with Contra leader Adolfo Calero and five other members of the
rebel directorate.
   Afterward, Calero expressed confidence that the $27 million aid
package will win final congressional approval.
   He said the rebels are prepared to resume peace negotiations
which were suspended three months ago but that the Sandinistas
``definitely have to create a climate'' to ensure progress will be
made.
   ``We're open to hear what the Sandinistas have to say,'' Calero
said.
   A fragile cease-fire agreed to six months ago remains in place
but there has been no progress between the two sides on reaching a
final settlement to their seven-year old conflict.

   Steak and potatoes is one of America's
most popular meals, but you wouldn't think so from the recipes of
the 62 top cooks in the 15th-annual National Beef Cookoff.
   ``No one is using potatoes, which is strange because meat and
potatoes are supposed to go together,'' said Sarah Lynn Quinn, who
is in charge of obtaining ingredients for next week's contest.
   ``We're buying plenty of tomatoes, though, and alfalfa sprouts,
dill pickles, avocados and every kind of lettuce you can imagine,''
she said Wednesday. ``We're buying about 10 to 15 pounds of
onions.''
   The contest runs Monday through Thursday, and the public is
invited to watch the cooks in action Thursday. A $5,000 award will
go to the first-place winner in each of three categories _
conventional, barbecue and microwave _ with a $10,000 bonus for the
best overall recipe.
   Last year's overall winner was Patricia Yee of California, who
won for her warm beef and black-eye pea salad.
   The contest is sponsored by several beef industry groups to
promote the use of beef.
   Quinn said she has been kept busy chasing down sometimes
frustrating ingredient demands by the competitors.
   ``One contestant wants orange chrysanthemums,'' she said. ``We
thought it was a flower. We found every color, but we couldn't find
orange ones. It turns out it's a garnish you make out of an orange.
We had the grocery store man looking everywhere.''

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Neil Frank, one of the nation's best known
hurricane experts, is getting his first in-person taste of a big
Atlantic storm as powerful Hurricane Gilbert neared Texas.
   But instead of his nearly constant appearances on all the
television networks from the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Cables, Fla., Frank is delivering his storm forecasts from the
studios of Houston television station KHOU.
   ``I'm not going to compete with them,'' he said Wednesday of his
former colleagues at the Hurricane Center. ``Not with all the
resources they have. It's a different operation. We're a
communication operation. They're a research operation.''
   Frank, whose distinctive flat-top haircut and exuberant sharp
voice made him familiar to millions of people along the Atlantic
and Gulf coasts, left the Hurricane Center about a year ago after
25 years in Florida and moved to Houston television.
   Although Frank is left with only several monitors, a computer
screen and a wall full of weather charts, he doesn't see his
absence from the Florida headquarters as an intense disadvantage.
   ``I can second-guess most of what they're doing and thinking,''
he said of the Hurricane Center. That comes from 25 years of
experience. I know what they're looking at, but I don't see all the
details and the models they're looking at.''
   Frank said he can still show viewers dramatic satellite views of
Gilbert and put the storm in motion.
   ``But when you come to forecasting, we're not doing a lot better
than when I went to the Hurricane Center 25 years ago,'' he said.
``It's fairly easy to communicate. But forecasting is a whole other
dilemma.''
   Ironically, if the eye of Hurricane Gilbert came ashore at
Houston and Galveston, it would be the first time Frank has been in
the middle of an Atlantic hurricane. While a forecaster in the Air
Force and stationed on Okinawa, he went through three Pacific
typhoons in 1956-57. But while in Florida, he never took a direct
hit.
   He remembers the first typhoon because he jumped in his car at
the end of his shift to go home.
   ``The first thing that happened, I turned on my windshield
wipers and they blew off,'' he said, laughing.
   Despite his new job, Frank remains in demand for his expertise.
His first commitment, however, is the station, then the CBS
network, of which KHOU is an affiliate.
   ``If we can satisfy other commitments, then we're doing so,'' he
said.
   Nevertheless, the station has received scores of calls asking
for Frank's thoughts on Gilbert, which he calls the worst storm
he's ever seen. The calls are so incessant, the news department's
executive producer is acting as Frank's agent during the storm so
he can do his work.
   And where does Frank think Gilbert is going?
   ``If you want to bet, I'd bet the hurricane doesn't come over
our head,'' he said from Houston. ``The thing that makes me most
concerned is that people would want and really need more accurate
information than we can provide.''

   Los Angeles will host the second debate
between Michael Dukakis and George Bush, and the vice presidential
candidates will hold their only debate Oct. 5 in Omaha, Dukakis
campaign officials said.
   The Los Angeles debate will be held Oct. 13 or Oct. 14,
depending on the major league baseball playoffs. A debate Sept. 25
in Winston-Salem, N.C., had previously been announced.
   The Dukakis officials also provided previously unresolved
details Wednesday on the format of the debates:
   _The 90-minute debates will include questioning by a moderator
and three panelists. There will be two minutes for answering each
question a candidate is asked, and one minute for the opponent to
add his opinion.
   _Each candidate will have two minutes for closing statements.
   _The candidates will be standing, as the Dukakis campaign had
wanted.
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr said the Bush campaign had informed her
that Omaha would host the vice presidential debate.
   One of the debates had originally been scheduled for Wednesday
night in Annapolis, the Maryland capital, and the Democratic
nominee taunted Bush for refusing to agree to a debate then.
   Bush officials had sought to limit the number of debates, even
though the Annapolis encounter had been scheduled by a bipartisan
commission.
   ``If George Bush isn't ready today after more than seven and a
half years as vice president of this country, how can we expect him
to be ready on January 20, 1989?'' Dukakis asked. ``Lloyd Bentsen
and I are ready.''
   Bush, in Fresno, Calif., said ``I'm looking forward to it.''
   He said he hopes to ``keep talking about what the issues are,
trying to pin him down, find out where he is today and keep telling
what positive message about where this country is going and where I
want to lead.''
   ``That's the big thing,'' he said.
   Bentsen said debating Quayle would give both an opportunity ``to
compare our records of experience and accomplishment in the U.S.
Senate.''

<HEAD>Foreign Visitors Spawn New Olympic Fad</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP EXTRA</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new species has surfaced recently in
South Korea: the Olympic visitor. Regardless of its size, color or
demeanor, it has evoked a new fad among South Koreans: Olympic
friendliness.
   ``Welcome to Korea'' says a young man at a bus stop.
   ``Can I help you?'' asks a businessman on his way to work.
   ``Thank you for coming to Korea,'' says a restaurant owner.
   Schoolgirls on the subway giggle and one says ``Where you
from.'' A reply elicts excited conversation in Korean.
   A man on the subway, peeking over the shoulder of a foreigner
writing a Korean name, points to the word and says ``Put in letter
`k.''' The man smiles, pleased with his contribution. ``Welcome to
Korea,'' he says.
   ``Excuse me'' says a smiling policeman, asking a foreigner to
stop for traffic.
   As recently as a few weeks ago, such happenings would have been
unusual. Never, it seems, have so many South Koreas smiled so often
at foreigners and said ``Welcome to Korea.''
   South Koreans are usually reluctant to speak to strangers and
foreigners, and by upbringing they shy away from initiating
conversation without proper introductions.
   ``In anonymous public situations, other people are treated as
though they simply do not exist,'' writes local columnist Edward W.
Poitras. Chong, the word for warm emotion, is reserved for those
one knows, not strangers.
   To speak to a foreigner _ not to mention in a language in which
one might not be proficient _ takes enormous effort. But as members
of an authoritarian society, South Koreans are quick to follow
direction.
   They have been told over and over again that hosting the Olympic
Games, which begin Saturday, is the country's most important
achievement and that it's urgent that all citizens cooperate in
making Olympic visitors feel at home.
   In recent weeks the government, Olympic organizers, radio and
television announcers and local neighborhood associations have
stepped up efforts to urge citizens to initiate contact with
foreign visitors.
   ``We are reminded that foreigners think it's okay to speak
first,'' said a student. ``We are reminded that foreigners like to
hear `Welcome to Korea.' ''
   A spokeswoman for the Korean Broadcasting Company says that
although there are no special programs on being kind to foreigners
many of the announcers on Olympic television and radio programs
urge citizens to exude friendliness.
   ``Announcers are encouraging people to be more positive about
foreigners,'' says Lee Jung-won of KBS. ``They don't want to push
the public because that might have a negative reaction. It's more
like a suggestion.''
   The rival MBC network has broadcast English language lessons
since last January. Listeners are reminded that even a few words
makes foreign visitors feel welcome.
   Kim Seung-ho, a spokesman for the Seoul Olympic organizers said
there had been no program training people to be friendly. But he
says there has been ``encouragement, indirectly.''

<HEAD>Stern Plays with NY Philharmonic for 100th Time</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: No PMs Planned</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Violinist Isaac Stern was guest soloist with the
New York Philharmonic for the 100th time on the night the
Philharmonic opened its 1988-89 season in Avery Fisher Hall.
   But Wednesday's concert concentrated on fine music and didn't
allow that milestone _ or the audience dressed for a party
afterwards _ to turn the evening into a mere event.
   Stern played Beethoven's ``Concerto for Violin and Orchestra.''
As that music speaks to a listener's soul, it is obvious once again
why Beethoven's music has endured and is so often played.
   Stern was hitting each tone right in its center. His entrance in
the piece was high and pure and later solo parts held pure, sweet
pianissimo. The New York Philharmonic audience, even those who pay
gala benefit prices and may not often attend again during the
regular concert season, knows that the etiquette is not to clap
between movements. However, the audience roundly applauded Stern
after the first movement.
   As the music went on, Stern played a firm, though delicate in
volume, thread of sound. And he made his pianissimo silver notes
sound warm.
   The orchestra, which returned last weekend from playing 16
sold-out concerts in 13 cities in 11 European countries, sounded
fresh on the season's opening night. After last season ended, the
Philharmonic played in Russia. Mrs. Neal Gilliatt, chairman of the
opening-night gala, conceived the banquet and dance afterwards as a
welcome home for the musicians and music director Zubin Mehta.
Decor in the party tent was meant to evoke Central Park, with
twinkling lights in trees.
   Mehta opened the program with Schubert's ``Rosamunde Overture.''
This overture begins with broad strokes, of which Mehta took full
advantage, and later sings with gaity. The orchestra played with
eagerness and clarity throughout.
   After intermission, the orchestra played orchestral music from
Wagner's ``Gotterdammerung.'' This was very grand and emotional,
fitting the opera. Applause was lavish and Mehta conducted an
encore, ``The Ride of the Walkures'' from Wagner's ``Die Walkure.''
Although this music makes an opera goer want to hear a Wagnerian
soprano sing with it, the concert ended on an exuberant mood,
upbeat for the season to come.

   Jesse Jackson said he has seen some moves ``in
the right direction'' by the South African government and refrained
from referring to it as a ``terrorist state'' after a meeting with
that country's ambassador.
   Jackson met Ambassador Pieter Koornhof for an hour Wednesday to
ask for the protection of three men who sought protection at the
U.S. Consulate in Johannesburg.
   The three men in South Africa had been jailed without trial for
as long as 21 months and entered the consulate Tuesday after
escaping from their guards at a hospital.
   Before the meeting took place, though, the South African
government already said the three anti-apartheid leaders would not
be rearrested if they left the consulate.
   Jackson had demanded that the Democratic Party condemn South
Africa as a ``terrorist state'' in its platform, but he would not
utter those words as he stood on the porch of the embassy.
   Instead, he spoke of hopeful signs in South Africa's foreign and
domestic policies.
   ``In the last few weeks some things have happened that are in
the right direction, and they must be encouraged,'' said Jackson,
adding that he was encouraged by South Africa's decision to
withdraw from Angola and by the elections in Namibia.
   ``But of course, the heart of the matter remains: Apartheid must
end,'' he said.
   Koornhof said after the meeting, ``I hope that the conciliatory
note that you have noticed here today will not be lost on the
American people, neither on the South African people.''
   Before his meeting at the South African Embassy, Jackson told a
meeting of black owners of radio and television stations to back
drives to register more black and Hispanic voters.
   ``You rise as the power rises,'' Jackson said. ``Who else but
you has the interest or the capacity to create voter fever?''

<TEXT>
   A 46-year-old woman barred from living in a
retirement community with her husband can now be ``a guest in her
own home,'' but only for 60 days a year, according to a court
settlement.
   An agreement signed by Middlesex County Superior Court Judge
John E. Bachman allows Mary Ann Romer to be treated as an owner and
non-resident of the Rossmoor condominium association.
   The agreement allows Mrs. Romer to buy property with her
60-year-old husband, Theodore, but restricts her from living with
him for more than 60 days a year until she reaches the community's
minimum residency age of 48, said her attorney, Samuel H. Davis.
   ``She is entitled to all the rights and privileges of any person
who is not a resident,'' Davis said Wednesday.
   Leonard J. Coates, an attorney for the association, said the
settlement means ``she can be a guest in her own home.''
   The dispute began in November when the Romers decided to buy a
unit at the 3,500-resident complex.
   Mrs. Romer was denied membership because of her age. Her
husband, who is semi-retired, was denied membership because he was
married to a woman younger than 48, Coates said.
   Coates said the couple bought the unit anyway, leading the
association to sue them charging that the purchase violated its
rules. A township ordinance mandates that residents of retirement
communities be 48 years of age or older, Coates said.
   The Romers will use the apartment on weekends since they
maintain a permanent residence in New York City, Davis said.
``They've made many friends over there and they enjoy the place,''
he said.

<HEAD>Technology Called Key To Solving Africa's Farm Ills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<HEAD>AP Farm Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The solution to Africa's vast and complex food
problems will require the heavy use of farming technologies adapted
to local methods, says the Office of Technology Assessment, a
non-partisan research agency of Congress.
   Existing ways of farming, which can vary greatly across the
continent, should be made more productive, the OTA said Wednesday.
It is this ``low-resource agriculture'' that offers the best hope
of producing enough food to keep pace with a growing population.
   The agency said in its report to Congress that ``building on
existing low-resource systems used in African farming, herding and
fishing'' would work better than trying to replace those methods.
   ``African agriculture faces a major challenge in the next few
decades,'' the report said. ``It will need to double production to
keep pace with a growing population and provide an adequate source
of household income to purchase additional food.''
   The report said it is uncertain whether technology exists to fit
Africa's food problems and whether it can transform low-resource
agriculture. But the report said it is clear ``some technologies
and practices do exist'' and could be used to improve African
agriculture.
   The study was requested by a number of Senate and House
committees involved in hunger, science and agriculture. The report
concentrated on that part of Africa south of the Sahara Desert, a
region where food and population problems are most acute.
   Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, chairman of the House Select
Committee on Hunger, said the OTA report was ``a clear and sharp
picture of the importance of low-resource agriculture in
Sub-Saharan Africa and the vital necessity of directly assisting
the poor African farmer in increasing crop production'' to combat
chronic hunger.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said the study shows that ``the
lesson of the 1980s is that we can no longer afford the trade-off
between short-term agricultural production increases and long-term
ecological degradation.'' New methods of agricultural development
are needed if Africa is to achieve ``a modicum of self-sufficiency
in its food systems,'' he said.
   The OTA report said African agriculture, for the most part, has
effectively adapted to meet changing conditions. But never has the
pressure been so great.
   ``Paramount is the pressure created by rapidly growing
populations and the consequent demands on the land,'' the report
said. ``The African continent has the most rapidly growing
population in the world _ 2.9 percent per year in 1988. Even if
this rate slows slightly as expected, the continent will have
triple its current population to feed within just 40 years.''
   With intensified land use, erosion, deforestation and other
abuses, yields have declined, the report said. Per capita food
production and income, along with nutritional levels, are dropping
in most areas.
   ``From the late 1960s to the late 1970s, Africa changed from a
net exporter of staple foods to a net importer,'' the report said.
``In 1986, the value of exports in 22 countries was not sufficient
to pay for imports.''

<HEAD>Binge Eaters May Have Defect in Hormone Controlling Appetite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abnormally low amounts of a hormone that controls
appetite may play a role in bulimia, the cycles of binge eating and
purging suffered by some young women, a study published today
concludes.
   The preliminary report found that some people with the disorder
make unusually small amounts of cholecystokinin, a hormone produced
by the intestines that makes people feel full, or sated, after a
meal.
   ``We conclude that patients with bulimia do not have normal
satiety and have impaired secretion of cholecystokinin in response
to a meal,'' the researchers wrote in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   Between 1 percent and 4 percent of young adult American women
and a much smaller number of men are believed to have the disorder.
Victims tend to eat large quantities of food, then purposely purge
themselves with vomiting or laxatives.
   Other studies have shown that anti-depression medicine is an
effective way to curb binge eating, and the latest research found
that the drugs also seem to increase levels of the appetite hormone
after a meal.
   However, the researchers cautioned that further study will be
necessary to see if correcting the apparent hormonal abnormality is
important in controlling bulimia.
   The study by Drs. Thomas D. Geracioti Jr. of the National
Institute of Mental Health and Rodger A. Liddle of the University
of California, San Francisco, compared the hormone levels after
eating in 14 women with bulimia to 10 healthy volunteers.
   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. David B. Herzog and Paul M.
Copeland of Massachusetts General Hospital cautioned that it is
premature to conclude that low hormone levels make people
susceptible to binge eating.
   But they added, ``Investigating bulimia nervosa from the
perspective of defective satiety offers a promising avenue of
research.''

Power</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientists reported today they have compressed
nuclear fuel to record densities by bombarding it with two dozen
laser beams, a step in developing a new kind of nuclear power
technology.
   But still higher densities will be needed to trigger a nuclear
reaction called fusion, the process that powers the Sun,
researchers wrote in the British journal Nature.
   Fusion releases energy as the nucleus, or core, of one hydrogen
atom fuses with another. Today's nuclear plants use another
reaction, fission, in which uranium atoms are split to release the
energy that holds them together.
   The new experiments focused on an approach to fusion called
inertial confinement.
   Researchers used glass pellets only two to three times the width
of a human hair. The pellets contained the nuclear fuel, a frozen
mix of two forms of hydrogen called deuterium and tritium.
   Each pellet was bombarded by 24 laser beams. The energy heated
the skin of the pellets, causing part of it to blow off. That
provided a rocket-like thrust toward the center of the pellet from
all sides, squeezing the fuel to the high densities.
   The fuel reached average densities of 100 to 200 times that of
its liquid state, said Robert McCrory of the University of
Rochester, who reported the results with Rochester colleagues.
   To achieve fusion, researchers will have to produce densities
approaching 1,000 times that of the liquid state, the scientists
wrote. In a telephone interview, McCrory said an average of 500
times typically would be enough because portions of the pellet
probably would reach the higher mark.
   Robert Kauffman, a physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., called the report ``another step
on the way to scientifically demonstrating the feasibility'' and
potential of inertial confinement fusion.

   Mick Jagger had a ``Peter Pan complex'' and
broke from the Rolling Stones to compete with younger musicians,
but now he's getting no satisfaction from his solo career, says
fellow Stone Keith Richards.
   ``Now he wants to put the Stones back together _ because there's
nowhere else to go,'' said Richards, who's about to release his own
solo effort, ``Talk is Cheap.''
   Richards, in an interview in the Oct. 6 Rolling Stone magazine,
said he never wanted to record without the Stones. But Jagger
thought he had outgrown the group when he turned solo in 1986.
   ``Mick kind of lost touch with the fact of how important the
Stones were for him,'' he said. ``He thought he could just hire
another Rolling Stones. ... And you can't. You can't hire that kind
of thing.''
   Jagger, he said, had a ``Peter Pan complex'' and was determined
to compete with younger musicians for space on the top 10.
   ``He's not living a happy life,'' said Richards. ``To me, that's
unacceptable. I've got to make him happy! To me, I've failed if I
can't eventually get my mate to feel good about himself.''

   David Letterman likes his new boots,
and Victor Mason says he had fun delivering them on national
television.
   ``It didn't bother me a bit,'' the Mason Shoe Co. president said
after presenting a pair of size 10{ dress boots, style No. 1197,
before a nationwide TV audience Tuesday on ``Late Night with David
Letterman.''
   ``I was amazed,'' Mason added. ``It was just like I was sitting
in my own living room. I'm a very quiet person, so I thought I
might be getting the jitters.''
   Letterman ordered the boots last month from Edd Hall, a visuals
coordinator for the show who became a Mason salesman through a mail
advertisement.
   The Chippewa Falls company conducts most of its business through
such ads which, Mason said, result in door-to-door sales and sales
to friends and relatives.
   ``Is there any way that from now on in the catalog we can refer
to these as Dave boots?'' Letterman asked as he slipped out of his
athletic shoes and into the new boots.
   ``I think we could, or we could put a star on it for you,''
Mason said.

   Ex-New York Yankees first baseman Joe Pepitone,
convicted in 1986 on two misdemeanor drug charges, was released
from Rikers Island jail after serving four months, a Correction
Department spokesman said.
   Pepitone, who played for the Yankees from 1962-69, was freed on
parole Wednesday after serving two-thirds of his six-month sentence
that included a work-release program in which he assisted the
Yankees in player development.
   Pepitone, 47, was arrested with two other men in a car on March
18, 1986, after allegedly running a red light. He was convicted for
possession of 300 Quaaludes and envelopes used to package drugs.

   Actress Ali MacGraw and other residents of
this celebrity enclave want a memorial to honor the memory of a
not-so-famous inhabitant _ a hermit known for three decades as
Malibu Joe.
   The money is pouring in as the community mourns the Labor Day
weekend beating death of the 96-year-old Joe, who chose to live in
the bushes behind a Texaco gas station.
   Flowers and cards have been placed around the tiny
shrub-surrounded area Joe called home, and Miss MacGraw has joined
others in a drive to build a modest memorial to the man who traded
hellos with one and all but never took handouts. More than $1,400
has been raised toward installation of a bench and permanent plaque
in his honor.
   ``There was a certain pride in Malibu Joe that isn't typical
with the usual street people,'' said Malibu Times editor Gil
Peters. ``For some reason, he turned himself into a folk hero.''

   Despite a comedy career that includes writing
the screenplay of ``The Graduate'' and appearing on ``Saturday
Night Live,'' Buck Henry doesn't try to analyze his creative
achievements.
   ``I have no theories about this stuff. I just do it,'' said
Henry, who as an actor is starring in Marlane Meyer's play
``Kingfish'' at the Los Angeles Theater Center through Oct. 23.
   In fact, it's ironic that he's made his name in comedy, said
Henry, who has earned two academy award nominations for his work on
``The Graduate'' and co-directing ``Heaven Can Wait,'' with Warren

   ``Personally, if I'm going to go to a film, I almost never
choose a comedy,'' he said.
   Why then does he write them? ``Because I know how to.''

   Cabot Cove, Maine, the fictional location
of television's ``Murder, She Wrote,'' may be getting a visit from
the real-life governor of the state, John R. McKernan.
   McKernan is planning a trip to California this fall to hobnob
with producers in hopes of luring more film industry business to
the state. But McKernan also has an ulterior motive: trying to land
a cameo role on the CBS mystery show.
   McKernan's possible road to stardom started when a loyal watcher
of the weekly mystery show spotted a photo of former Democratic
Gov. Joseph E. Brennan while visiting the Hollywood set recently,
and called the governor's office.
   McKernan's spokesman, Willis Lyford, said an autographed photo
of the governor was promptly dispatched to actress Angela Lansbury,
who plays mystery writer and detective Jessica Fletcher on the show.
   McKernan must first pass a photo test, however, so a few shots
of him riding a school bus with children and visiting fairs are
being sent to Hollywood for approval.
   It's ``a portfolio ... to determine if he's suitable,'' said
Lyford.

<HEAD>Air France Fires Pilot Of Jet That Crashed In Air Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air France says it has fired the pilot of the A320
Airbus jetliner that crashed during an air show in eastern France
in June, killing three passengers as hundreds of people watched.
   Michel Asseline, a senior pilot with Air France for eight years,
was fired Wednesday ``following a particularly grave failure for
which he was held responsible and which made his continued
employment with Air France impossible,'' a company spokesman said.
   The firing followed a recommendation by the Disciplinary Council
of France's Civil Aviation Authority that punitive action be taken
against Asseline and co-pilot Pierre Mazieres, an Air France pilot
for about two months at the time of the crash.
   The Council's action marked the first independent, official
conclusion that blamed the crash on pilot error.
   Air France said it would make a decision on the fate of Mazieres
before the end of the month, the spokesman said. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Transport Minister Michel Delebarre was expected to make a
decision in the next few days on whether to revoke the two pilots'
commercial pilots licenses as recommended by the Council.
   Hundreds of spectators witnessed the accident at the
Mulhouse-Habsheim air show, one of the first domestic
demonstrations of the new plane, which went into service last
spring.
   Although three people died in the crash, 137 passengers and crew
escaped.
   The sophisticated aircraft is controlled by computers rather
than mechanical cables in a system known as ``fly-by-wire.''
   Airbus, the European consortium that manufactures the A320,
invested millions of dollars in its development. It has called the
A320 the fastest-selling plane in aviation history and has received
hundreds of orders from around the world.
   The day after the crash, French transport ministry officials
called a news conference to say the pilots were flying too slow and
low in violation of normal safety regulations. They said the plane
was not at fault.
   The pilots maintained they were unfairly blamed, and said the
plane had failed to respond quickly to attempts to raise it.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Move To Change Design of Coins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With little debate, for a change, the Senate
has approved a bill to redesign the reverse sides of the penny,
nickel, dime and quarter.
   The legislation, approved on a voice vote Wednesday, also calls
for issuing special coins commemorating the centennials of six
states and the 100th birthday of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   The Senate sent the three separate bills to the House where at
least one and possibly two of them may face strong opposition. The
most controversial measure, at least in the House, calls for
modernizing the coin designs.
   The bill suggests the redesigned coins reflect such American
constitutional ideas as freedom of speech and assembly, the right
to trial by jury, the right to vote, the separation of powers, and
the right to equal protection under the law.
   The first redesigned coin to be issued would be required to have
a design commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Constitution.
That design would be replaced with another theme after a two-year
period.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the House Banking
consumer affairs and coinage subcommittee, is strongly opposed to a
general redesign of the nation's coins and says he will fight any
attempt to bring that bill to the House floor before Congress
adjourns next month.
   A second bill would require the issuing of five-dollar
commemorative coins to celebrate the centennials in 1989 and 1990
of Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington and
Wyoming.
   The bill requires that up to 350,000 coins be minted for each
state and that they be made largely of palladium, a silver-white
metallic element related to platinum.
   The measure requires that the palladium be mined and refined in
the United States.
   Curtis Prins, an aide to Annunzio, said the congressman has
``big problems'' with that provision because, he said, the only
operating U.S. palladium mine cannot produce enough of the mineral
for the coins and still meet other requirements. The only other
sources of palladium are South Africa and the Soviet Union, Prins
said.
   The third and least controversial bill, introduced by Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas, calls for the minting of a
one-dollar coin to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth
of President Eisenhower on Oct. 14, 1890.

<HEAD>Report Says Economic Growth In Third World Has Slackened</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newly industrialized economies of East
Asia are enjoying a surge of exports but economic growth in the
world's developing nations as a whole is slipping, the
International Monetary Fund said in a new report.
   The IMF, a 151-nation body based in Washington, also said in its
annual report that Third World countries' failure to reduce their
debt is the main cloud over the world economy.
   The economic outlook in Western Europe, Asia and the United
States has improved, it said, despite the continuing large U.S.
trade and budget deficits.
   In the developing world, especially among the newly
industrialized nations of East Asia, ```many countries have
benefited from vigorous export growth,'' the report said.
   ``Nonetheless ... the average growth rate in the developing
countries fell from 4.2 percent in 1986 to 3.4 percent in 1987,''
it said. This was due in part to stagnation in oil-exporting
countries, where increasing oil prices were offset by higher prices
for those countries' imports.
   ``Much of 1987 and the first part of 1988 were characterized by
continued expansion in world output and trade,'' the report said.
But, it added, ``there is no room for complacency.''
   The IMF said that besides indebtedness primarily in Africa and
Latin America, other concerns are:
   _The trade deficit and foreign debt of the United States.
   _The lack of economic growth in Africa.
   _The return to high inflation in Latin America.
   The total debt of the developing countries increased to $1.2
trillion last year from $1.1 trillion in 1986, the report said.
   Governments and international organizations such as the IMF
loaned about $34 billion to developing countries during the year,
while commercial banks and other private lenders were ``virtually
drying up'' as a source of needed new loans, the report said.
   New private lending totaled $8 billion, far short of the $43
billion still needed by the developing countries, it said.
   On the positive side, it said, ``real output in the industrial
countries expanded by over 3 percent in 1987, somewhat faster than
in 1986.''
   Efforts by the United States and its allies to reduce the value
of the dollar and increase other currencies like the yen and the
deutsche mark have paid off in helping to reduce the U.S. trade
deficit, the IMF said. And it singled out Japan for undertaking
reforms to stimulate domestic demand.
   The moves have increased imports in Japan and West Germany, but
dampened demand for imports in the United States, it said. The
dollar dropped 13 percent between February 1987 to April 1988,
bringing it near its previous lows of 1978. By mid-1988, however,
the dollar had stopped dropping and had begun rising, it said.
   Still, the U.S. ``current account'' deficit, covering the
broadest measure of trade including merchandise and services
continued to widen last year. This was due in part to increased
payments of interest and dividends on U.S. government and private
debt to foreigners.

<HEAD>New Devices Could Save Many Cardiac Arrest Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New, easy-to-use heart shock machines are a
``very, very important advance'' that improve the odds of saving
many of the 400,000 Americans who die each year of cardiac arrest,
researchers reported today.
   Researchers in Seattle found that giving the devices to
firefighters allowed them to revive heart victims who would have
died if care were left to paramedics who arrived just minutes
behind them.
   ``There is no question that this is a very, very important
advance in treating prehospital cardiac arrest victims,'' said Dr.
Donald D. Brown, who has worked with the devices at the University
of Iowa.
   The machines cost between $4,000 and $7,000 and are highly
sophisticated versions of the defibrillators, which doctors and
paramedics have used for decades. But unlike their forerunners,
these devices are so automated they require little training to
operate.
   When attached to the chest of someone who has collapsed, the
device will check the victim's heart and deliver a shock if it
finds cardiac arrest, a disastrous interruption in the heart's
blood-pumping rhythm. If given soon enough, the shock almost always
restarts the stalled heart.
   Dr. W. Douglas Weaver of Harborview Medical Center in Seattle,
who directed the study, recommended that the devices be available
in police cars, fire trucks, ambulances, office buildings, stadiums
and anywhere crowds gather.
   ``Many communities that have not been able to deliver definitive
care to cardiac arrest victims will be able to do so with the
advent of this new technology,'' Weaver said in an interview.
   Weaver's work was published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Jeremy N. Ruskin of
Massachusetts General Hospital called cardiac arrest ``the most
important public health problem in the United States.''
   The Seattle results with the automatic defibrillator ``provide
strong support for its use by those first on the scene,'' he wrote.
   ``Their conclusions are very important and very valid,'' said
Dr. Philip Podrid of Boston University Medical Center. ``This is an
electrical problem. It requires immediate response and definitive
therapy.''
   During cardiac arrest, the heart suddenly stops pumping blood
due to a disruption in its electrical signals, and the victims
falls unconscious. Unless the heart starts beating within four to
eight minutes, brain damage or death are likely.
   Most victims have not had heart attacks. So if their heartbeat
is restored quickly, they often live for years without permanent
heart damage.
   Frequently the first to respond to cardiac arrest are
firefighters or police, who administer cardiopulmonary
resuscitation but not electric shocks.
   ``You can do the best CPR in the world, and unless you can
deliver a shock in that eight-minute window, the likelihood of
survival goes down dramatically,'' Weaver said.
   In the study, Seattle firefighters were given four hours of
training in use of the new defibrillators. Firefighters who arrived
first to treat someone gave shocks to 276 patients, while 228
others got only CPR until paramedics showed up a few minutes later.
Thirty percent of those treated first by the firefighters survived,
compared with 17 percent of those given shocks by later-arriving
paramedics.
   Just how many people would be saved if the devices were widely
available is unclear. However, Weaver estimated that in communities
where only 5 percent or 10 percent of cardiac arrest victims are
saved, the devices might raise survival to 25 percent, and in areas
with more sophisticated emergency services, a third or a half might
be saved.

   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen
has found some resistance as he battles to sell defense-minded
Texans on the idea that running mate Michael Dukakis is an advocate
of a strong military.
   Bentsen was heckled constantly on Wednesday by a cadre of George
Bush supporters in a home-state audience of defense industry
employees who heard him present the Democratic ticket's position
that the Republicans put too much emphasis on space weapons and not
enough on conventional forces.
   Charges that Dukakis would weaken defense were ``wild charges
and innuendo from the vice president and his handlers,'' Bentsen
told employees of the LTV missile division. ``That's campaign hot
air, a hit-and-run attack staged for the evening news network.''
   ``If I believed there were a thread of truth in that tapestry of
partisan blame, I would not be campaigning with Mike Dukakis,'' he
said.
   Bentsen fought repeated shouts from hecklers as he delivered the
message. For a short time, one man shouted rebuttals to nearly
every statement Bentsen made, including yelling ``bull'' each time
the Texas senator listed a Dukakis position in favor of a military
program.
   The normally unflappable Bentsen fumbled over parts of his
speech, at one point calling the location of the plant ``Grand
Rapids'' instead of ``Grand Prairie'' before catching himself.
   At the end of the speech, when he asserted that Dukakis would
set higher moral standards to complement the weapons, Bentsen said
that included ``the right to speak _ of hecklers like that one.''
   Bentsen planned to announced today that a Texas business group
would work for the Democratic ticket. He was then traveling to
Shreveport, La., a campaign stop that might be shelved depending on
Hurricane Gilbert, and to Memphis, Tenn.
   It was announced Wednesday that Bentsen would debate Indiana
Sen. Dan Quayle, the Republican vice presidential nominee, on Oct.
5 in Omaha, Neb.
   Bentsen, in a statement Wednesday afternoon, said he was looking
forward to the meeting. It will be an opportunity ``to compare our
records of experience and accomplishment in the U.S. Senate,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Mouse With Human Immune System Called A New Tool Against AIDS,
Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers say they created a ``human
mouse'' by transplanting the human immune system into rodents,
providing a powerful new tool to study and combat AIDS, cancer,
herpes and many other human diseases.
   In separate studies, the scientists said they used human blood
cells or tissue from aborted human fetuses to develop mice that
produced human antibodies and T cells, the class of white blood
cells attacked by the AIDS virus as it cripples patients' immunity.
   With human immune systems, the mice should make excellent
stand-ins for people, allowing researchers to more rapidly develop
and test new drugs and vaccines against a variety of diseases, said
the scientists from Stanford University and the La Jolla-based
Medical Biology Institute.
   ``We've developed a system in which we can study human cells
directly in a small laboratory animal,'' Dr. Mike McCune, chief
author of the Stanford study, said Wednesday.
   McCune and co-author Dr. Irving Weissman also said such mice
could lead to development of better methods to transplant organs,
and reduce researchers' need to use dwindling populations of
chimpanzees for studies of human ailments.
   ``I consider it a major accomplishment,'' especially in the
fight against AIDS, said Daniel Koshland Jr., editor f the journal
Science, which will publish the Stanford study Sept. 23.
   The British journal Nature today published the other study,
conducted by Dr. Donald Mosier and others at the Medical Biology
Institute and the Veterans Administration in La Jolla.
   Dr. David Katz, the institute's president, said the researchers
succeeded in ``making a human mouse.''
   ``It is not human in the real sense because the mouse is walking
around and behaving like a mouse, only it is protected by a human
immune system,'' Katz said during a telephone interview.
   Mice and other animals normally serve as only approximate models
or stand-ins for people when researchers infect them with human
diseases and test possible new drugs and vaccines on them. Such
studies often are difficult or impossible to perform on humans for
various ethical and practical reasons.
   The deadly AIDS virus cripples the immune system, leaving
patients vulnerable to death from various infections and cancers.
But the virus doesn't infect normal mice and behaves differently in
chimps and monkeys than in people.
   However, mice with human immune systems should suffer the same
kind of AIDS symptoms as humans, making them extremely valuable for
testing possible new drugs and vaccine, the researchers said.
   Katz said Mosier's team injected mice with peripheral blood
leukocytes _ a type of white blood cell _ to successfully
reconstitute a fully functioning human immune system in mice
suffering severe combined immune deficiency, an inherited absence
of immunity.
   Such mice normally would die quickly from infections, but have
been kept alive up to eight months, he said, adding that the mice
also produced human antibodies against tetanus.
   The Stanford team gave 300 of the same kind of mice partially
functioning, temporary human immune systems _ lasting two to three
months _ by implanting them with aborted human fetal tissue
containing ``stem cells'' and other building blocks of the human
immune system, McCune said.
   With the consent of abortion patients, the scientists took liver
cells and bits of thymus and lymph glands from the fetuses, then
injected the liver cells into the mice and surgically implanted
pieces of thymus and lymph glands into the rodents.
   The same mice also can be used to study many other human viral
diseases and possible drugs and vaccines against them using ``a
human system outside the human body so you don't have to expose a
human subject to these treatments,'' Katz said.
   McCune and Katz said such diseases include certain leukemias and
other virus-caused cancers; various forms of hepatitis; and herpes
simplex, mononucleosis and other ailments caused by members of the
herpes virus family.
   The mice also could be implanted with a variety of human tissues
and wouldn't reject the tissues. McCune said that would let
scientists use the mice to study the progression of many non-viral
human diseases _ including diabetes, arthritis and cancers _ and
drugs that might treat the diseases.
   Koshland said Science released the Stanford study early because
the La Jolla study was being published and because federal
officials are considering the Reagan administration's proposed ban
on experimental use of aborted human fetal tissue.
   ``This is an excellent example of the carefully scientifically
controlled use of fetal tissue to attack major human disease
problems,'' said Koshland, who opposes the ban.

<HEAD>CBS' `48 Hours' Does Quick Switch to Live Show on Hurricane</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ferocity of Hurricane Gilbert has prompted
CBS' weekly news show ``48 Hours'' to mobilize for a live broadcast
tonight, postponing the taped report on infertility that had been
planned.
   The news show normally examines a news subject by editing 48
hours' worth of videotape into a kind of instant documentary. But
the fast-approaching hurricane didn't give CBS much time to tape
anything, so much of tonight's program will be live, said executive
producer Andrew Heyward.
   ``What we always said is that we would respond to breaking news
when we thought we could add something to it,'' Heyward said.
``This is really a kind of hybrid between `48 Hours' and
special-events coverage. We think the story is potentially so big
we're doing a special edition of `48 Hours' that looks ahead to the
story even though we didn't spend two days taping it.
   ``We'll see if it works, but the notion is that the people are
hungry for information we can provide, and we will look ahead.''
   He said the news division originally had planned to dispatch
crews to tape 48 hours of coverage when the storm hit. That would
have been turned into next week's show, which would have been a
quick turnaround.
   ``So what's really `48 hours' about it, we're doing it on less
than 48 hours' notice,'' Heyward said Wednesday. ``Soup to nuts,
this is even less. In fact, we jokingly said around here today we
should call it `4.8 hours.'''
   Dan Rather will anchor the broadcast. Reports will come from 14
correspondents who were hurriedly dispatched to the Caribbean,
where the storm has caused devastation in Jamaica; to Mexico, which
was battered Wednesday; and across the Gulf Coast areas of the
United States, which were bracing for the arrival of the storm.
   ``I don't want to sound corny, but I do think it's a genuine
public service,'' said Heyward. ``It won't be as stylish as what we
normally do, nor should it be. But we're going to deliver important
information.''

<HEAD>House Seeks To Toughen Penalties For Insider Traders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has unanimously approved a bill that
would increase fines against convicted Wall Street insider traders,
lengthen their prison terms and penalize investment firms that
permit the practice.
   The measure was passed Wednesday by 410-0, but its fate is
unclear in the Senate, where the legislation may not advance unless
the House approves a Senate-passed banking bill.
   When the House measure was debated on Tuesday, supporters cited
the steady stream of big-money insider trading cases that have
attracted widespread public attention in recent years.
   Just last Wednesday, the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. was named in a civil complaint filed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission charging insider trading, fraud and other
violations.
   ``The single drumbeats that began two years ago have threatened
to become a deafening symphony of illegality that would drown out
the voices of those honest small investors and market professionals
who seek to be heard in our securities markets,'' said Rep. Edward
Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House telecommunications and
finance subcommittee, where the bill originated.
   The legislation would expose securities companies to fines if
the firm ``knew or recklessly disregarded'' that its employees
committed insider trading violations. The fines would be up to
triple the profits gained or loss avoided or $1 million, whichever
was greater.
   Maximum criminal fines for insider trading convictions would be
boosted from $100,000 to $1 million for individuals and from
$500,000 to $2.5 million for companies. The maximum jail term would
be doubled to 10 years.
   The SEC would be allowed to award bounty payments to people
whose tips result in insider trading prosecutions. The bounties
could be as much as 10 percent of penalty imposed or the settlement
reached with the convicted trader.
   In addition, investors who lost money because of insider trading
would be allowed to seek damages from the insider traders.
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, said last week he is considering withholding similar
legislation unless House leaders reverse course and agree to move a
measure giving banks new power to underwrite securities.

   Honduran security forces early
Thursday arrested 16 Americans who demonstrated in front of the
U.S. Embassy and at a U.S. air base to protest Washington's policy
in Central America.
   Maj. Manuel Urbina, spokesman for the Public Security Forces,
said four Americans who protested in front of the embassy were
being held at the Casamata prison in the capital.
   Another 12 who staged a one-hour protest at the U.S. air base in
Palmerola, about 40 miles northwest of the capital were being held
at a police jail in Comayagua, four miles away, Urbina said.
   He said the arrests were made without resistance and the
Americans would probably be expelled.
   U.S. officials in Honduras could not be reached immediately for
comment.
   Urbina said none of the demonstrators carried passports or
identification.
   In Guatemala City, four Americans threw blood on the steps of
the U.S. Embassy Wednesday and chained themselves to the gates of
the compound in a protest against U.S. policy in Central America.
   The protests were organized by a group called Project
Independence and held one day before Central American countries
celebrate the anniversary of their independence from Spain in 1821.
   John Mateyko, a spokesman for the group in Washington, said the
protest was ``religious-based and non-violent'' against what he
called ``the immoral and dangerous policy'' of the Reagan
administration in Central America.
   Mateyko identified the four demonstrators in Tegucigalpa as John
Bach, 41, of Hartford, Conn.; Teri Allen, 30, of Hartford; Patricia
McCallum, 47, of Cambridge, Mass., and Mark Fryer, 31, of West
Creek, Pa.
   The names of those being held in Camayagua were not immediately
available.
   Mateyko identified the demonstrators in Guatemala City as
Charley Litky, 57, a Congressional Medal of Honor winner for his
service as a Roman Catholic priest in Vietnam, and Sara Story, 26,
both of Washington, D.C.; Dale Ashera-Davis, 34, of Baltimore, Md.;
and John Schuchardt, 49, of Leverett, Mass.
   ``At this time of remembering Central American independence from
Spain we've come to join with Central Americans in declaring its
independence from U.S. domination,'' a declaration read by the
group said.
   ``In eight years neither (President) Reagan or (Vice President
George) Bush seems to have figured out that that's all these people
want,'' it said.
   The demonstrators, who threw blood on the embassy steps before
chaining themselves to the gates, were demanding an audience with
the U.S. ambassador to Guatemala, James Michel.
   By Wednesday evening, the four were still chained to the embassy
gates as Guatemalan National Police officers looked on.

   The State Department says an intelligence
report that Libya is on the verge of producing chemical weapons is
``a particularly worrisome development'' in light of Libya's record
of state-sponsored terrorism.
   Department spokesman Charles Redman on Wednesday called on
nations that may be contributing to the Libyan program to halt
their aid. He said the kinds of materials used in chemical weapons
are available on the world market.
   Redman said the United States verified the alleged Libyan
activities only recently, but he provided no information on type of
weapons Libya is developing nor did he say how U.S. officials
learned of the operations.
   Redman noted that there were reports last year that Libya had

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is
insisting that fired White House aide Oliver L. North produce
hundreds of pages of classified diary pages the former Marine
lieutenant colonel has so far kept from the panel.
   The committee voted 11-8 on Wednesday to insist North comply
with a subpoena it issued five months ago.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., is seeking the full diaries for a
subcommittee investigating international narcotics trafficking
because of heavily censored references to narcotics he noticed in
copies of diaries obtained by the Iran-Contra committees.
   North, through his attorney Brendan L. Sullivan, has objected to
turning over the voluminous diaries. Kerry urged his colleagues to
pursue the papers, saying ``delay plays into the hands ... of those

   Congress has approved $8.8 billion in spending
for military construction projects in the year beginning Oct. 1.
   The appropriation came in separate votes hours apart Wednesday,
first in the House and then in the Senate, that sent the compromise
measure to President Reagan for his signature.
   The House-Senate agreement is an increase from the $8.3 billion
construction budget for the current fiscal year but is below the
$9.7 billion sought by Reagan.
   It includes $65 million for the final stage of construction of a
national test facility in Colorado for Reagan's Strategic Defense
Initiative, also known as Star Wars. Absent, however, is $31
million Reagan had sought for construction of a railroad-based

   Textile industry supporters confess they are
worried over plans to send their embattled trade bill to a
House-Senate conference committee just weeks before Congress
adjourns.
   ``The quickest way would be to get it over to the president
because you can get delayed in conference,'' Rep. Ed Jenkins,
D-Ga., a leading textile industry supporter, said Wednesday. He
expressed fear that ``we'd get it into conference and never get a
vote.''
   Designed to protect American manufacturers from foreign
competition, the bill would freeze textile and apparel imports at
1987 levels and limit growth to 1 percent annually starting next
year.
   Non-rubber footwear imports would be frozen at 1987 levels with
no provision for any increase in the share of the American market
that foreign manufacturers already command.
   Textile-state lawmakers say the bill is needed to save American
jobs. Critics counter that it would raise prices, narrow consumer
choices, bring retaliation against U.S. exports and cost more jobs
than would be saved.
   President Reagan, in an interview published in The Washington
Times on Thursday, said the version of the bill passed by the
Senate is ``purely protectionist and must be vetoed.''
   The Ways and Means Committee decided on a voice vote to send the
measure to a conference committee to resolve differences between
the House and Senate versions, dashing hopes of textile forces that
Senate changes would be quickly accepted and the bill whisked to
Reagan's desk.
   Other delays already have plagued the bill. The Senate passed
the measure last week but has been unable to send it back to the
House. Opponents have kept it bottled up on a technicality.
   The Senate was expected to vote today to break that grip and get
the measure moving again.
   An earlier version of the measure drew a Reagan veto in 1985,
and the administration has again been sprinkling the debate with
veto threats.
   So far, sponsors have failed to muster the two-thirds needed in
both chambers to override a presidential veto. But they have been
attempting to speed the bill to Reagan's desk to prevent him from
exercising a so-called pocket veto. The president can stop a bill
from becoming law merely by refusing to sign it when Congress is
not in session.
   Lawmakers have set Oct. 5 as a target date for adjournment,
although a one-week extension would not be surprising.
   Sponsors say the political price paid by critics would be higher
if Reagan were forced to wield his veto pen rather than blocking
the measure merely by stuffing it into a desk drawer.
   Lawmakers urging a conference committee said they were concerned
over four changes made by the Senate after House passage a year ago.
   One would set up a one-year pilot program providing for the
auctioning of import licenses and quotas to U.S. importing firms.
Some lawmakers said it represented too large a change from current
policy to accept without study.
   Also a focus of concern was a Senate provision that would
guarantee other countries larger textile and apparel quotas in the
U.S. market if they increased their purchases of American
agricultural goods.
   The idea is to ease concern among farm lawmakers over possible
retaliation on the part of Asian textile nations that are among the
largest purchasers of American agricultural products. But some
urban lawmakers were unimpressed.
   Only two other differences exist between the House and Senate
versions. The House bill, passed 12 months earlier, would freeze
imports at 1986 levels. Textile forces say they would not object to
the Senate version. The Senate measure also would set up a special
import quota for silk neckties.

<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gilbert damaged 80 percent of
Jamaica's homes, devastated crops and left eastern sections of the
island looking ``like Hiroshima after the atom bomb,'' said Prime
Minister Edward Seaga.
   Speaking to reporters Wednesday after a five-hour inspection
flight over the island, he estimated damage at $8 billion and said
one out of every five homes was destroyed.
   State-run Jamaican Broadcasting Corp., operating by generator,
said at least 19 people were killed when the storm whipped across
the island on Monday.
   The hurricane, the most intense on record, also killed five
people in the Dominican Republic on its sweep westward through the
Caribbean before slamming into Mexico's Yucatan peninsula Wednesday
with 160 mph winds.
   The Jamaican Embassy in Washington said 500,000 of Jamaica's 2.3
million people were rendered homeless, and the government estimated
that about 150,000 people were in distress shelters set up around
the island in sports stadiums, churches, government buildings and
movie theaters.
   In the Dominican Republic, officials reported widespread crop
damage. The country's main electricity relay station remained out
of service Wednesday, leaving half the capital of Santo Domingo
without power.
   Heavy crop damage also was reported in the islands of St. Lucia,
Guadeloupe and St. Vincent.
   Seaga told reporters the storm wiped out 100,000 of Jamaica's
500,000 homes, with another 300,000 damaged: ``We saw whole
villages where not a single building was left standing. It looked
like Hiroshima after the atom bomb.''
   The storm, which dumped up to 10 inches of rain on the island,
wiped out the island's banana crop and poultry industry and heavily
damaged the coconut industry and garden crops, Seaga said.
   Two days after the hurricane's passing, Jamaica remained without
electricity. Most regions still had no water.
   Seaga said damage was widespread along the southern coast west
of Kingston, although not as devastating as on the eastern end.
   The northern coast, where Jamaica's vital tourist industry is
based, escaped the worst of the storm, and only two of the region's
luxury hotels appeared to have suffered noticeable damage.
   In Kingston, Jamaica's capital city of 750,000, trees, zinc
roofs, telephone poles and billboards littered the streets.
Military and civilian volunteers worked in virtually every street,
pulling down collapsed roofs, sweeping up debris, and bringing food
to the homeless.
   At the National Chest Hospital, officials had to contend not
only with storm damage but with looters who stole mattresses and
other supplies.
   Seaga said he had no doubt ``that this is going to be the worst
disaster that we have experienced in our modern history.''
   He said he would hold an emergency Cabinet meeting today to
re-evaluate government reconstruction priorities and projected
costs, as well as Jamaica's requirements in international aid.
   ``Now, our first priority is to provide shelter and
sustenance,'' the prime minister said. ``It's obvious we'll have to
spend much more money than we thought initially we'd have to.''
   The United States has sent in Navy cargo planes with plastic
roof covering and collapsible water storage tanks. Offers of aid
have come from Canada, Britain, France, West Germany and Israel,
Seaga said.
   Government officials said Kingston's Norman Manley Airport,
severely damaged by Gilbert, would reopen to Air Jamaica flights
today or Friday.
   Part of the tarmac for smaller aircraft was littered with
twisted and bent planes Wednesday. A 10-seater sat against a row of
palms, its bruised nose to the ground.
   The embassy in Washington said airports were open for emergency
traffic only, and communications were extremely limited. It said it
had no reports of American victims.
   Power outages forced doctors to conduct surgery by flashlight at
many hospitals, where the winds had caused floods and torn off
roofs.
   The tiny Cayman Islands began returning to normal Wednesday with
no reported deaths, few injuries and much less damage than feared.
The islands' 23,000 people ``got on their knees and said `Thank
you,''' said local journalist Carol Winker.

   A hearing-impaired boy who apparently cannot
speak was abandoned in a church playground by a woman who then
disappeared, police say.
   The 3- or 4-year-old boy was found Saturday after an anonymous
caller said she saw a woman leave the boy that afternoon in the
playground of the First Methodist Church.
   ``He appeared to be well taken care of,'' Detective Tony Sanchez
said Wednesday. ``He can make noises but nothing understandable.''
   Officers are calling the boy David Gallup and have placed him in
state Social Services custody.
   ``I don't think he's from around here because we would have
heard something from someone by now,'' Sanchez said.
   Doctors said the boy's developmental level seemed low but that
might be attributable to his hearing impairment and apparent
inability to communicate, Sanchez said.
   His case seemed similar to that of a hearing impaired boy found
wandering the streets of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, earlier this year.
That child eventually was reunited with his mother in Mexico.

   Worried Jamaican-Americans clung to the telephone and listened
to news reports about their hurricane-ravaged homeland, but
information was scant as makeshift collection centers readied tons
of supplies for the Caribbean island.
   ``The response has been marvelous. It's always so where our
country is concerned,'' said Lancelot Evans, a spokesman for the
Jamaican Consulate in Miami.
   Hurricane Gilbert swept over Jamaica on Monday, killing at least
19 people and destroying one-fifth of the nation's 500,000 homes in
what was described by Prime Minister Edward Seaga as the country's
worst natural disaster ever.
   ``Kingston was beautiful. Now they can't even recognize it,''
said Vincent Clive Kirkland of Miami, who was waiting for the
chance to bring food and medicine to his family in St. Mary,
Jamaica.
   ``Jamaica is not like America. People do not have insurance. It
will all be their expense,'' Kirkland added. ``If there's any help
the United States can give, we're going to need it.''
   In the New York area, home to the nation's largest Jamaican
community, estimated at 300,000 to 600,000 people, a Brooklyn
health clinic began accepting food, clothing and bedding for
shipment to Jamaica. Several local Caribbean groups also set up
relief funds.
   Nicola Taylor, 27, an administrative assistant for a hotel firm,
said she has been trying since Tuesday to contact her parents and a
sister in the small town of St. Ann's, near Kingston.
   ``The calls won't go through,'' she said. ``This is driving me
up a wall.''
   The United States government, meanwhile, is sending $396,000
worth of supplies to Jamaica, the Agency for International
Development said. The supplies include 360 rolls of plastic
sheeting, 200 tents, 3,966 water jugs, 18 water tanks, 10 chain saw
kits and 9,600 cotton blankets.
   A portion of the assistance was flown by the military from a
U.S. stockpile in Panama on Wednesday.
   Jamaican officials expect Kingston's Norman Manley International
Airport to open soon for emergency flights, Evans said. When it
does, tons of food, clothing, medicine and building materials
gathered here will be sent.
   Air Jamaica as well as U.S. carriers Midway Airlines and Eastern
Airlines promised to fly supplies to Jamaica for free.
   Hundreds of doctors and nurses from Dade and Broward counties in
Florida also are on standby if the Jamaican government requests
medical assistance.
   ``We're planning now _ waiting for communication to open,'' said
Joanne Gonzalez, spokeswoman for the Jamaican United Relief
Association in southern Florida. ``Once the government requests, we
will go.''
   Some 50,000 to 60,000 Jamaicans live in south Florida. Many
jammed the consulate, waiting nervously for word of conditions back
home, while others staffed makeshift relief supply centers in
homes, offices and restaurants.
   In Oakland, Calif., residents and civic leaders began a drive to
help Oakland's sister city in Jamaica, Ocho Rios, a resort town of
10,000 near Montego Bay.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms have ignored Soviet
women, who spend their days doing back-breaking physical labor in
poor conditions but have no significant political power, women
complained in two Soviet newspapers.
   In articles published in Wednesday's edition of Pravda, the
country's leading newspaper, and the Sept. 9 edition of New Times
weekly, women complained that their country had created a ``third
sex'' _ women who do exhausting labor and are not respected as
women.
   ``I'm not calling for extremism, but most women's voices are
audible only in their kitchens,'' wrote Larisa Kuznetsov in the New
Times weekly.
   The women also complained that birth control was unavailable and
the infant mortality rate was too high.
   The glittering image of Raisa Gorbachev, the articulate, stylish
wife of the Soviet leader, has helped obscure the fact that 70
years after the Russian Revolution, many women here still must work
at demanding jobs for low or modest pay, the women said.
   In the Pravda article, entitled ``Why I Can't Be a Minister,''
Y. Barulina, an adjuster at Moscow's ZIL auto plant, wrote that
``almost 3.5 million of us toil in conditions that don't meet
occupational safety regulations.''
   Barulina said that although Gorbachev's economic reforms should
in principle improve life for Soviet women, it isn't happening.
   What's more, the typical Soviet woman, no matter how successful
at her job, is expected to bear the burden of housework, said
Barulina, who is also deputy chairman of the government-sanctioned
Soviet Women's Committee.
   ``If, let's say, I managed to make it to a minister's armchair,
what then would happen with the housework?'' she asked. ``You see,
at home, a woman minister must be a housekeeper, a wife, a mother.''
   Ms. Kuznetsova's two-page essay in the New Times, a virtual
catalog of grievances for Soviet women, contended the world's first
socialist society had spawned a ``third sex'' and went so far as to
call for the beginnings of a women's movement.
   ``In our country, for some reason, there is not a serious
women's movement,'' wrote Ms. Kuznetsova, whose byline appeared
above the story but was not further identified. ``With a program,
its right and left wings, and if you like, with its extremists,
firebrands and leaders.''
   She said widespread menial work by ``the weaker sex'' may have
become an inescapable aspect of Soviet life.
   ``After all is said and done, we have made many Eves do jobs
that Adams should do. Female labor, by no means ennobled by
redeeming technology, has insidiously wormed its way into the very
marrow of our economy,'' Ms. Kuznetsova wrote.
   As for birth control, she said, ``The situation with
contraception in our country is more or less like what it is with
personal computers _ there aren't any.
   ``Every fourth abortion on the planet is ours,'' she wrote.
``This tops the practice of developed capitalist countries by six
to 10 times.''
   Soviet infant mortality statistics are also high, 26 per every
1,000 births, Ms. Kuznetsova wrote. ``And in several Central Asian
republics the situation is completely awful: 50 or 60 (infant
deaths) per 1,000 (births).''
   The Soviet woman's vital economic role is not accompanied by any
significant political clout, Kuznetsova said.
   No women are on the 13-member Communist Party Politburo, the
nation's ruling body, and only one woman, Alexandra Biryukova, sits
on the party's No. 2 group, the Secretariat.
   ``When we repair railway lines and lift railway ties, we are, so
to say, not women at all,'' Ms. Kuznetsova said, noting that nearly
a third of all railway workers, or 65,000 people, are women. ``On
the other hand, when we want a part in decision-making, we are just
`ladies.'''
   She urged that Gorbachev's drive for ``perestroika,'' or social
and economic reconstruction, open more top government offices to
women.
   ``Many women are irked by the spate of male perestroika
eloquence. They are sick and tired of the complete absence of at
least a few small islands of material impact in perestroika,'' she
wrote. ``It is high time too that we saw women among the country's
leaders. ''

week ago to pursue her dream of studying fine arts was shot to
death after she refused to give up her purse during a robbery.
   Judith Anne Wrappe of Little Rock was shot at least once in the
chest as she struggled with the gunman early Wednesday near Pratt
Institute, where she was enrolled as a first-year graduate student,
said Deputy Inspector Charles Prestia.
   A tall man in a hooded gray sweatshirt fled on foot clutching
the bag in his arms, witnesses told police.
   ``Judith was just pursuing her dream,'' said her mother, Sue
Wrape. ``She was struggling with her dream and it looks like she
was struggling with her purse. That's typical of her,'' the mother
said through tears during a telephone interview.
   The mother uses the family's traditional spelling of their last
name.
   Ms. Wrappe, a 1987 graduate of Notre Dame University, had
arrived in New York City on Sept. 7 and enrolled at Pratt to pursue
a master's degree in fine arts. On Monday, she was hired to work as
a waitress at Manhattan's popular South Street Seaport.
   ``She was a clean-cut kid who seemed honest and had an outgoing
personality,'' said Mark Shay, the restaurant manager who hired
her. ``She did mention to someone here that it was a culture shock
moving from Arkansas to New York City.''
   ``She said she didn't feel safe in the neighborhood she was
living in,'' Shay added.
   After her first night at the restaurant, Ms. Wrappe took a
subway to Brooklyn and was one block from the dormitory where she
lived with three roommates when she was accosted, Prestia said.
   ``There was some kind of a struggle between the fellow and the
victim. She had shouted out, `Leave me alone,' when he fired one
shot, hit her in the chest, and escaped with the handbag,'' Prestia
said.
   During the commotion, a resident of a nearby building yelled out
the window at the gunman to `leave her alone,''' Prestia added.
``It was just shortly after that that he fired the shot.''
   The killer took her brown leather handbag and ran down the
street, where the bag was recovered about a block from the killing.
Police did not know if anything was taken.
   Despite Ms. Wrappe's fears, students are rarely victims of
crimes, Prestia said.
   Pratt's president, Richardson Pratt Jr., said the students are
urged not to travel alone at night. He said the school employs 37
full-time security guards who patrol the area. Six to eight of the
guards are assigned to patrol at night, he said.
   Judith had last spoken to her parents on Sunday, her mother
said. ``She was happy, and getting settled into school. ... She was
going to look for work. I guess she found it.''

   Former Olympic ice skater Tai Babilonia,
unhappy about recent performances, was hospitalized nearly four
hours after taking a large number of pills in what was termed an
accidental overdose, police said.
   Her father denied it was a suicide attempt and her publicist
contradicted a police report account of the incident.
   Miss Babilonia was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and
released four hours later Wednesday in good condition, hospital
spokeswoman Paula Correia said.
   ``I talked to her and she seemed fine,'' said Miss Correia.
   The skater left the hospital with her mother, Cleo, and skating
partner Randy Gardner, the spokeswoman said, declining to discuss
what type of pills were involved or other details. Miss Babilonia's
publicist, Michael Levine, contradicted a police account of the
incident.
   A police spokesman, Bill Frio, said the 28-year-old skating star
had earlier called her manager, Nancy Rosenberg, saying she was
unhappy about her recent skating performances and had taken a large
number of pills.
   Her mother was notified and called paramedics, who picked the
skater up at the family home.
   ``We have to take an injury report in any situation like this,
but we are treating this as an accidental overdose'' despite Miss
Bablyonia's conversation with her manager, Frio said.
   The skater's father, retired Los Angeles police Detective
Constancio Babilonia, called police to say his daughter took the
pills accidentally and that it wasn't a suicide attempt, Detective
Bruce Janis said.
   Levine said Miss Babilonia ``was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center for treatment of severe stomach cramps due to a reaction to
a non-prescription medication.''
   ``I was one of two people that saw her. She looked like she had
gone two rounds with (heavyweight boxing champion) Mike Tyson.''
   He denied it was a suicide attempt, and said the police report
about the skater's conversation with her manager was wrong.
   ``Yes, her manager spoke to her this morning, but it was a very
routine conversation,'' Levine said.
   In 1979, Miss Babilonia and Gardner were crowned world figure
skating champions in Vienna, Austria, shattering the 14-year Soviet
domination of pairs skating. They were the first Americans in 29
years to capture the title.
   Gardner and Miss Babilonia were favored to win a gold medal in
mixed-pairs figure skating during the 1980 Winter Games in Lake
Placid, N.Y. But they had to drop out of the competition because
Gardner suffered a leg injury.
   After the failed Olympic bid, the duo signed on with the Ice
Capades and performed with show until 1983, said show spokesman Tom
Abramson. The couple also was featured guest stars at the Festival
on Ice, Knott's Berry Farms' Ice Spectacular and a summer Ice Show
in Lake Tahoe, and appeared in television commercials.

   A West German fighter-bomber stalled
and plunged into the sea off Denmark during NATO maneuvers, and its
two crewmen were missing, the alliance's command said today.
   The RF-4 Phantom jet crashed off southern Denmark into Greatbelt
Strait between the Baltic islands of Zealand and Funen, Defense
Command Headquarters said.
   The jet, out of the West German air force base of Leck, was
simulating an enemy attacker when it appeared to stall at an
altitude of about a half-mile, the command said.
   Danish navy vessels and rescue helicopters scoured the crash
site Wednesday, and West German forces took over the search today.
   A total of 18,000 troops from Denmark, West Germany and Britain
are participating in the one-week ``Bold Grouse'' maneuver, which
includes practice of amphibious landings.

<HEAD>Yoko: Goldman's Lennon Bio `Totally Fiction'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A biography that portrays John Lennon as a
drug-addled, anorexic bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool to
New York City is ``totally fiction,'' Yoko Ono said in a national
radio broadcast.
   ``It's amazing that somebody took such a poetic license. I don't
see John in there ... It's a very dramatically described something,
but it's not about John,'' Ono said Wednesday night in her first
broadcast comments on the book by Albert Goldman.
   The usually reclusive Ono agreed to the interview to counter
Goldman's ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' which presents the
ex-Beatle as a violent, drug-addicted drunk who wanted to dump his
wife.
   As for Ono, Goldman shows her as a gold-digger who snorted
heroin up to the time of Lennon's death. Goldman also charges she
was responsible for Paul McCartney's 1980 marijuana bust in Japan,
had affairs while they were married and was just as intent on a
divorce as Lennon.
   Ono refuted virtually all of these charges, and countered
through taped interviews with Lennon friends and employees that
Goldman's book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes.
   ``It's totally fiction,'' Yoko said during the hour-long
program, which opened with Lennon's song, ``Gimme Some Truth,'' and
coincided with the book's national release Wednesday.
   ``These people in this book are not us. It's not John and me,''
Ono continued. ``It's unfair he's been assaulted and can't hit
back. ... For some reason this book is attempting to rob both John
and I of the basic human dignity that we're entitled to.''
   The Ono interview was taped Aug. 28 at the Dakota, where the
Lennons lived _ and Yoko still lives with their son, Sean. Lennon
was murdered by Mark David Chapman outside the Dakota on Dec. 8,
1980.
   The interview was broadcast nationwide via the Westwood One
Network; spokeswoman Laurie Wilde said an exact figure on how many
stations picked up the broadcast was not available.
   Also appearing were Sean and Lennon other son, Julian. Ono was
interviewed by longtime associate Elliot Mintz, who is described in
Goldman's book as a spy for Yoko _ a charge Mintz denied during the
show.
   ``It is, for one, very upsetting, but most of all it is lies,
untruths ... The whole thing is just sickening,'' said Julian, who
also refuted Goldman's tales of Lennon as a violent father.
   Mintz read excerpts from the book to Yoko, who then responded to
the allegations point by point. She denied that Lennon was
homosexual; that he was using drugs while living at the Dakota with
his son, Sean; that he had become a reclusive rock 'n' roll Howard
Hughes.
   She did acknowledge having a heroin problem during the late
1970s, but rejected Goldman's assertion that she had a
$5,000-a-week habit.
   The book has already drawn angry responses from friends of
Lennon and Ono McCartney, who contradicted one anecdote involving
Lennon smashing a painting in Paul's home, has urged a boycott of
the book.
   After Yoko's rebuttal, listeners were invited to dial 900-digit
telephone numbers to vote on whether the book was an accurate
portrayal of the Lennons' life. Results were not expected until
later today.
   Goldman, who conducted more than 1,200 interviews for his Lennon
book, has written controversial biographies of comedian Lenny Bruce
and Elvis Presley.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Lash Texas Panhandle; Apparent Tornado in Amarillo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms unrelated to Hurricane Gilbert lashed the
Texas Panhandle today with strong winds and torrential rains and
spawned an apparent tornado in Amarillo.
   Hurricane Gilbert's outer reaches kept rain and thunderstorms
over southern Florida and the Keys. The hurricane moved off
Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula into the Gulf of Mexico, where its 120
mph winds were expected to strengthen, and a hurricane watch was
posted for the entire Texas coast.
   The Texas Panhandle storms dropped up to 5 inches of rain south
of Amarillo late Wednesday and today. The rain pushed Lake Bennett
over its shores and flooded roads around Amarillo with up to 5 feet
of water.
   The storms generated 60 mph gusts and produced golf-ball size
hail. About a dozen homes were damaged in southwest Amarillo where
residents reported sighting a tornado late Wednesday.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms also extended across western
Kansas and eastern Colorado into western Nebraska and over
northeast North Carolina. A band of showers extended from western
Missouri and eastern Kansas to eastern North Dakota.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
over the eastern Gulf of Mexico region and Florida; showers and
thunderstorms over the northern and central Plains, the upper
Mississippi Valley, northwest Missouri and Oklahoma; and widely
scattered showers in northwest Washington state. The rest of the
country was predicted to have mostly sunny skies.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 50s over northern New England;
in the 60s along the Pacific Coast, the central Rockies, the
northern Plains, the upper Mississippi Valley and from the northern
Great Lakes to southern New England; in the 90s in southern
Florida, the lower Mississippi Valley, Texas and the inland
California valleys; and near 100 degrees in the desert Southwest.
Highs elsewhere were expected to be in the 70s and 80s.
   Early morning temperatures ranged from the 30s and 40s in the
Great Lakes, central and northern Plains and northern Rockies to
the 60s and 70s from the southern Plains and lower and middle
Mississippi Valley to the southern Atlantic Coast and lower 80s in
southern Florida.
   At 3 a.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 35 degrees at Marquette,
Mich., to 83 degrees at Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, Fla.

<TEXT>
   After returning an $819,200 contempt fine, a
federal judge told Yonkers officials and other parties in the
city's desegregation case to move quickly on any changes to a
proposed housing plan.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand, who ruled in 1985 there was
housing segregation in the state's fourth-largest city, said
Wednesday he would allow revisions in the plan, but insisted they
be finished by Sept. 30.
   Sand added that he expected both sides in the desegregation
lawsuit would get together and work things out because the city had
learned what one councilman termed ``a very expensive civics
lesson.''
   ``We must move forward with as much speed as circumstances
permit,'' said Sand, noting that the case was 8 years old and that
not a single Yonkers resident had enjoyed improved housing
opportunities as a result of the lawsuit.
   The new plan, designed to lessen the impact of 200 units of
low-income housing by mixing some of it with middle- and
upper-income units, must be approved by the Justice Department and
Sand.
   It must then be formally approved by the City Council before it
can replace the original plan Sand imposed.
   That plan was resisted by the council, prompting Sand to fine
the city $1,638,300 for contempt of court before the council
finally gave in early Saturday. In voting to approve incentives for
Sand's plan, the council asked that the substitute plan be
considered.
   Sand returned a check for $819,200 on Wednesday, essentially
refunding the fine incurred the day before the council meeting that
ended the battle.
   The refund meant that Yonkers' contempt had cost it $450,505.
Although the escalating fines had totaled $819,100 before last
Thursday, $368,595 of that had been designated for city schools.

   The dollar traded steadily in thin European
trading today and dealers expected it would retain the gains from
the previous day's smaller-than-expected trade deficit.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign exchange dealers said market activity was light, partly
because of a national holiday in Japan, and there were no signs of
central bank intervention.
   They predicted the dollar would remain well-supported by gains
won Wednesday after the U.S. government announced a July trade
deficit of $9.53 billion, down from $13.22 billion in June. The
dollar rose sharply after the unexpectedly large narrowing of the
deficit was announced.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.8749 West German marks, down from 1.8783
   _1.5810 Swiss francs, down from 1.5835
   _6.3760 French francs, down from 6.3915
   _2.1144 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1155
   _1,399.75 Italian lire, up from 1,399.50
   _1.2240 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2223
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6785, more expensive for
buyers that late Wednesday's $1.6750.
   In Tokyo, financial markets were closed for Respect for the Aged
Day, a national holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 133.95
yen, down from late Wednesday's 134.55.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $421.40 a troy ounce,
and at midmorning the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $421.50. Both bid prices were down from the
$421.75 bid late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $421.75, up slightly from $421.50
bid late Wednesday
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold remained unchanged today to close at
a bid $423.45.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.50 a troy
ounce, up from Wednesday's $6.53.

   Blacks and whites gather tonight in the
church where four black girls were killed by a Ku Klux Klansman
exactly 25 years ago in memory of the victims and the civil rights
struggle that changed Birmingham.
   ``We as a city are merely looking at ourselves, and saying that
we remember,'' said Betty Lee, a member of a biracial group that
planned the memorial service at the 16th Street Baptist Church.
   Among those scheduled to speak are the Rev. John Cross, pastor
of the church when the Sept. 15, 1963, bombing occurred, and Mayor
Richard Arrington, a black man whose election was one result of the
fight for equal rights that racked the city in the 1950s and 1960s.
   The four girls were killed minutes after a Sunday school lesson
on ``a love that forgives,'' Cross said. ``That's what we really
had to practice for the next several weeks and months and years _
and even now.''
   Although some city leaders had worked for healing prior to the
church bombing, it was that event, among numerous bombings and
civil rights demonstrations, that spurred the city to make major
changes.
   The City Council now has six blacks and three whites. Chris
McNair, father of one of the bomb victims, was elected to the
Legislature and now sits on the Jefferson County Commission.
   ``I can't erase it out of my life,'' he said of the bombing,
``but I try my best not to rely on it as a crutch.''
   In addition to killing 11-year-old Denise McNair, the bomb took
the lives of Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Dianne Wesley and Carole
Robertson, all 14.
   The girls were in a basement bathroom of the church preparing
for a special youth program when the 10:22 a.m. explosion tore
apart the side entrance to the building. A bomb had been placed
beneath steps near the bathroom window.
   Donations totaling $500,000 came from around the country. The
money paid for the girls' funerals and repairs to the church, which
had been used for civil rights meetings.
   The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who had called Birmingham the
nation's most segregated city, preached at the combined funeral of
three of the victims.
   Sarah Collins Riley, 12, was injured by the blast. In 1977 she
testified at the trial of Robert Edward Chambliss, a retired
automobile mechanic and Ku Klux Klansman. A jury convicted him in
the death of Denise McNair, and he died in prison in 1985 after
serving eight years of a life sentence.
   ``If the bombing was meant to stop or deter the civil rights
movement, it did not,'' said Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, a founder of
the civil rights movement in Birmingham and now a Cincinnati pastor.
   ``We pick up the pieces, we bury our dead ... but we keep our
faith and keep on moving,'' Shuttlesworth said. ``I think these
things do more solidifying and bring about more determination than
if they did not happen.''
   The church contains a plaque and memorial nook downstairs and a
memorial in the sanctuary with pictures of the four girls.
   Former Mayor David Vann was a leader of a 1962 movement to
change Birmingham's form of government, in which Public Safety
Commissioner Eugene ``Bull'' Connor had ordered that dogs and fire
hoses be used against demonstrators that spring.
   The city in November 1962 went from a three-member commission to
a nine-member council and mayor, and blacks, who now outnumber
whites in the city, gradually gained control of city government.
   After the church bombing, Vann said, most businesses that had
signs for blacks and whites removed them.

   Potential jurors in the divorce-fixing trial of
former Miss America Bess Myerson are being asked their opinions on
politicians' honesty, men who leave their wives for another woman
and women who get involved with married men.
   U.S. District Judge John Keenan questioned jurors Wednesday with
Miss Myerson, her co-defendants, their attorneys and members of a
news pool present.
   By the end of the day, eight of 19 prospective jurors questioned
had been accepted for the pool of 55, from which the final panel of
12 jurors and six alternates will be picked.
   Keenan was to resume questioning potential jurors today. Jury
selection, an often tedious process, is expected to take up to two
weeks.
   But the fourth-floor federal courtroom in Manhatta was jammed
Wednesday with reporters, sketch artists and spectators waiting to
see Miss Myerson and her co-defendants, even though most of the
action took place behind closed doors.
   Miss Myerson, 64, a former city cultural affairs commissioner;
her boyfriend, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso, 43, once a leading city
contractor; and the judge who handled his divorce, former state
Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel, 75, are charged with mail
fraud and conspiracy for an alleged scheme to fix Capasso's divorce.
   Miss Myerson is also charged with obstruction of justice.
   She is accused of giving a $19,000-a-year city job to Mrs.
Gabel's daughter in 1983 in return for reductions by the judge in
Capasso's alimony and child support payments.
   Miss Myerson, unescorted and wearing dark glasses, nearly
managed to slip into the courthouse unnoticed.
   Cameras are not allowed in federal courts and scores of
newspaper and television photographers were camped outside.
   She was halfway up the steps when she was spotted and instantly
surrounded by cameras and microphones.
   But the crowd parted before her as she silently entered the
courthouse, maintaining the regal bearing that helped her win the
1945 Miss America title.
   Court security officers, also surprised at her sudden
appearance, hustled onto an elevator with Miss Myerson and two
reporters.
   Miss Myerson asked if there was a cafeteria in the building.
Marvin Smilon, a reporter with the New York Post, replied:
``There's one on the fifth floor, unfortunately it's opposite the
press room.''
   That sparked laughter from Miss Myerson and everyone else in the
elevator.
   Half an hour after Miss Myerson arrived at the courtroom,
Capasso, who is serving a prison sentence for an unrelated tax
evasion conviction, was escorted into the room by marshals.
   He bent over Miss Myerson, and the couple clasped hands and
kissed each other on the cheek as 10 courtroom artists sketched the
scene.
   At the end of the day, photographers followed Miss Myerson into
the subway, and onto a subway car before it pulled out of the
station.

   Rock star Prince, who helped develop
the funky ``Minneapolis sound'' that put the city on the national
music map, got a royal welcome as he kicked off his first U.S. tour
in four years before a cheering hometown crowd.
   Prince dazzled the near-capacity crowd Wednesday night with
virtuoso guitar playing, soulful singing and quick dance steps
reminiscent of an early James Brown.
   ``Love. Can it be trusted?'' the 30-year-old singer asked at one
point in the 2{-hour performance. He led the crowd in chanting
``Love is God. God is love.''
   ``We can love. It's so much easier than hating. ... It's easier
than dying,'' he said.
   Prince frequently urged the crowd to clap and sing along.
   ``I'm from Minneapolis. I'd really appreciate it,'' he shouted.
   Performing in a theater-in-the-round setting on an elaborate $2
million stage designed for his ``Lovesexy'' tour, Prince gyrated
with his female dancer, Cat, among a giant urban playground that
included a basketball hoop and a swing set.
   The lithe Prince emerged onstage in numerous different flashy
costumes. At one point he ripped off his jacket, flipping it toward
the screaming crowd. During part of the concert he appeared
shirtless, during another segment he wore a long leather trenchcoat.
   The ``Lovesexy'' tour makes its U.S. debut following a
highly-successful European tour. The tour continues through October.

   A federal judge has barred the apparent
front-runner for president of a Teamsters local from seeking
office, ruling that his victory could restore mob influence to the
first union taken over by court-appointed trustee.
   ``Normally, the members should be free to elect incompetent,
unwise or even dishonest officials if they choose,'' U.S. District
Judge Dickinson R. Debevois said Wednesday. ``However, more than
mere competence, wisdom or honesty is involved here. There is
involved the question of the renewed subjugation of a major union
local to an organized crime group.''
   Ballots are to be mailed Nov. 4 and counted Dec. 6 in the first
contested election since the 1960s at Union City-based Teamsters
Local 560, which was placed in trusteeship in 1986 to rid it of
alleged control by members of the Gambino crime family.
   Local 560 trustee Edwin Stier is to step down after the
elections.
   The judge's ruling, which was sought by the government, was
aimed at Joseph Sheridan and Michael Sciarra, the favorite for
president of the 8,000-member local.
   ``We lost, but don't ask me why,'' an angry Sciarra said. ``I
think we're better off in Poland than in the United States of
America. It's supposed to be the United States of America, but I
don't think it is.''
   Sciarra was president and Sheridan vice president from 1984 to
1986 while the union appealed the trusteeship decision.
   The judge, relying partly on wiretaps of reputed mobsters, said
the government had shown illegalities under Sciarra, including the
continuation of sweetheart contracts, intimidation, Mafia efforts
to control union affairs, and the failure of Sciarra and Sheridan
to repudiate the local's dark history.
   Sciarra's attorney, Alan Zegas, called the ruling ``truly an
unwarranted intrusion'' into the election process and said he would
appeal.
   Zegas said it was wrong for the judge to act before the
election. If Sciarra won, the judge could then consider his
removal, Zegas argued.
   Debevoise said he had the power to act under the federal
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, under which the
government brought suit to remove the union's executive board.
   ``The public interest in racketeer-free corporations and unions
overrides the interest of stockholders of corporations or members
of unions freely to select their officers,'' he wrote.
   Russell Viggiani, a candidate for Local 560 president, said the
ruling was a disappointment because it would cast a cloud over the
outcome.
   ``I'm hoping that after this election is over, the ticket that
is elected will have the support of the entire rank and file,'' he
said.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa sat down
with government leaders today to discuss setting up broader talks
on the future of the banned labor movement.
   Walesa is taking a tough line and demanding that his independent
trade union be legalized. Solidarity was suppressed in a December
1981 military crackdown and was outlawed the following fall.
   Today's talks followed a similar meeting Aug. 31, after Poland's
worst labor unrest since the crackdown.
   Walesa was accompanied by mediator Andrzej Stelmachowski and the
Rev. Alojzy Orszulik of Warsaw. Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw
Kiszczak and alternate Politburo member Stanislaw Ciosek, the head
of a national unity group known by its Polish initials PRON,
represented the communist government.
   The labor leader traveled from his home in Gdansk to Warsaw late
Wednesday and refused to discuss a government report that he would
be meeting with officials led by Kiszczak.
   The ruling Politburo, in a statement issued by the state-run
news agency PAP Wednesday, said: ``A desire to narrow down the
talks to bargaining in line with the unfortunate principle of
`everything or nothing' is a great misunderstanding.''
   Earlier, government spokesman Jerzy Urban said Walesa would be
meeting with a group similar to the one of Aug. 31, when he
gathered with Kiszczak, Ciosek and Roman Catholic Bishop Jerzy
Dabrowski.
   That session brought Walesa and government officials together
for the first time in six years.
   Four days later, after the government promised ``round-table''
talks at which Solidarity's reinstatement would be discussed, the
last strike was called off.
   Urban said today's talks would be taking place ``in a
conciliatory atmosphere.''
   Andrzej Stelmachowski, president of the Club of Catholic
Intelligentsia, said in a telephone interview today that he could
not comment on the talks. He has been acting as a go-between in
setting them up.
   ``You must understand that the situation is very delicate now,''
he said.
   The 19-day strike wave that ended Sept. 3 idled Poland's two
biggest ports and crippled production of high-grade coal for export.
   Walesa was sharply criticized by some union members for ending
the strike without a firm guarantee that the union would be
legalized. A Solidarity conference held over the weekend in Gdansk
said that legalizing the union must precede any real dialogue on
the country's future.

   Retail sales, dragged down by a sharpest drop
in auto sales in 10 months, declined 0.2 percent in August, the
government said today.
   The Commerce Department said that sales dropped $330 million to
a seasonally, but not inflation, adjusted $133.5 billion.
   Most economists had been both expecting and hoping for the
slight decline, taking it as evidence that growth in consumer
demand has slowed, thus easing inflationary pressures in the
economy.
   It was the first overall decline in sales since April's 0.4
percent drop and followed a revised 0.1 percent gain in July, which
had originally been estimated at a stronger 0.5 percent.
   Auto sales fell 1.8 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted
$29.1 billion. It was the sharpest decline in this volatile
category since October.
   Excluding autos, sales last month rose a modest 0.2 percent
following a slight 0.1 percent gain in July.
   Sales at department and other general merchandise stores were
also weak, falling 0.4 percent in August to $15.1 billion,
following a 0.1 percent drop a month earlier.
   Analysts say hotter than usual weather in August along with
consumer indifference to new fashions in women's clothing held back
department store sales.
   Sales of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last
three or more years, were down 1.0 percent last month, held back by
autos and by a 1.2 percent drop in furniture sales.
   Furniture sales had fallen 2.1 percent in July. Rising mortgage
interest rates have cut into home buying and when home sales drop,
analysts say fewer home furnishings are sold.
   Sales of building supply, hardware and garden stores were up 0.6
percent in August.
   Sales of non-durable goods were up 0.4 percent last month,
despite the decline at department stores.
   Food and grocery stores posted a 0.8 percent gain. Sales were up
1.3 percent at gasoline stations, 1.1 percent at drug stores and
0.4 percent at specialty clothing shops. They declined 0.6 percent
at restaurants and bars.

   Hurricane Gilbert transformed this idyllic
Caribbean resort into a nightmare for thousands of stranded
tourists sheltered in cramped hotels and public buildings.
   ``Believe me, I will not come back here,'' said Pete Fournier of
Long Island, N.Y.
   His wife, Sheila, bemoaned their evacuation from the Villas
Playas Hotel. ``It had an ocean-front view, which is now washed
away,'' she said.
   Bringing winds of up to 218 mph when it hit this Yucatan coastal
city Wednesday morning, Gilbert forced about 6,000 tourists to
leave their beachside hotels and seek shelter, according to an
official with the National Civil Defense System.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 30,000
workers and residents also sought temporary shelter on the island
off the Yucatan peninsula, a popular vacation spot for Americans.
   Jennie Valdez, a U.S. consular representative in Cancun, said
she did not know how many tourists were in Cancun, but that 40,000
and 65,000 people visit the resort city each month.
   As the storm shattered windows, twisted utility poles and
flattened homes, about 150 tourists were crammed into a
20-by-50-foot room in Cancun's City Hall.
   Gilbert's fierce winds ripped police and radio antennas off the
roof above, and stiff palm fronds crashed into windows.
   However, some newlyweds took in stride the forced exchange of
beach-front views for boarded-up windows.
   ``The first two days were great,'' said Joseph Camuccio of
Philadelphia, who arrived in Cancun Sunday. He said he and his wife
had not eaten in 24 hours and were trying to figure out how to get
out of Cancun.
   Even as Gilbert closed in on Cancun, many residents resisted
attempts by authorities to move them to safer areas.
   ``There were people who did not want to leave,'' said an army
official who checked the area for stranded residents. ``It was
something new. They didn't know what a cyclone was.''
   He said most people, particularly those in low-lying areas,
changed their minds once the storm hit.
   Mexico's National Weather Service ordered the evacuation of
everyone living less than 15 feet above sea level and within 2,000
feet of the Caribbean coast.
   Some tourists said that winds made shrieking sounds at the
height of the storm. Others compared the noise to the pounding of
heavy surf.
   Broken windows in the commercial area of the tourist mecca
invited bands of young looters.
   ``They're looting all the stores,'' said Alfredo Moro Sanchez of
the state judicial police. About three or four people were
arrested, City Police Director Juan Manuel Arteaga said.
   City officials said Wednesday they knew of only two minor
injuries caused by the storm. They also reported five births during
the hurricane.

   A former member of the Chicago Board of Trade has
been convicted on charges he and three others carried out a scheme
in which one of them used a wig and other disguises to make illegal
trades worth $308,000.
   Thompson B. Sanders, 45, was found guilty of conspiracy, wire
and commodities fraud and interstate transportation of stolen
property. He could receive as much as 55 years in prison and $1.3
million in fines at sentecing Nov. 3.
   The charges stem from four trades of U.S. government bond
futures in 1986.
   The government charged that Sanders and Dan Dewey, Dan Kolton
and David Pelleu participated in a scheme in which Dewey wore a wig
and used fake credentials to gain access to the U.S. Treasury bond
trading pit at the CBOT.
   Once in the pit, Dewey set in motion trades that allowed the
four to pocket $308,000 in profits. Prosecutors said the disguise
and fake credentials allowed the four to walk away from bad trades
while claiming profits from good ones.
   The three accomplices pleaded guilty to conspiracy and wire
fraud.

   Republican nominee George Bush has closed a
16-percentage point gap and is now running neck-and-neck with
Democrat Michael Dukakis in their battle to win California voters,
according to a new poll.
   The California Poll released on Thursday showed that Dukakis' 52
percent to 36 percent lead over Bush in late July had been reduced
to 46 percent to 45 percent, a tie within the poll's 4 percent
margin of error.
   ``It's a dead heat,'' said Bill Lacy, Bush's chief operative in
the state. ``We always thought that when people started comparing
the two candidates, George Bush would do very well.''
   Anthony Podesta, Dukakis' California campaign manager, said the
poll reflects GOP attempts to paint Dukakis as an ultraliberal
Democrat.
   The Republicans ``have thrown a lot of mud,'' Podesta said,
``but the bumper stickers of August won't be what decides the
outcome in November.''
   The new poll shows Dukakis leading in Northern California and
among women voters and minorities. Bush is ahead in Southern
California and among men and non-Hispanic white voters.
   ``It's a phenomenal reversal. I've never seen anything like
it,'' said poll director Mervin Field. He cautioned that ``people
can easily change their minds.''
   ``The voters began by looking at Bush and a lot didn't like what
they saw. But they also didn't have a fix on Dukakis,'' Field said.
``Now they've begun to look at Dukakis. He's been under attack by
the Bush people for several weeks, and he hasn't handled it well.''
   The latest California Poll shows Bush is supported by 83 percent
of the state's GOP voters. Support among Democrats has grown to 14
percent from 9 percent six weeks ago.
   Meanwhile, the Massachusetts governor's strong showing among
Democrats who voted for President Reagan in 1984 has eroded.
   Six weeks ago, so-called Reagan Democrats backed Dukakis over
Bush by 55 percent to 26 percent. The latest poll shows the
breakdown is 48 percent for Dukakis and 44 percent for Bush.
   The poll was based on telephone interviews with 674 registered
voters and was conducted between Sept. 6 and Sept. 12.

   Patrick Kennedy, the 21-year-old son of
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, has become the latest member of his famous
family to win public office, soundly defeating an incumbent in a
Democratic primary for Legislature.
   In a Democratic primary for governor Wednesday, businessman
Bruce G. Sundlun won the right to oppose Republican Gov. Edward D.
DiPrete in November. In a congressional race, Democratic Rep.
Fernand St Germain held off a strong challenge.
   Kennedy, a junior at Providence College, beat five-term Rep.
John Skeffington 1,324 votes, or 57 percent, to Skeffington's 1,009
votes, or 43 percent. Kennedy wins the office because there is no
Republican opposition in November.
   ``They told me to wait my turn. Well, tonight it's our turn ...
for representation that listens to the needs of the people and not
the demands of the party bosses,'' Kennedy told a cheering crowd as
his father and other family members looked on.
   Retorted Skeffington, ``I thought they were the party bosses.''
   Kennedy called his father in for a fund-raiser and repeatedly
challenged the voter registrations of Skeffington supporters. On
Wednesday, the Massachusetts senator posed with voters for pictures
outside a polling place.
   ``I'm not nervous,'' the senator said. ``I'm proud of him. He
has worked hard. He'll do a good job.''
   Skeffington, who was endorsed by much of the local Democratic
leadership, questioned whether Kennedy was committed to the area
and suggested he was trying to use the race as a stepping stone to
Congress.
   Skeffington said he was certain why he lost. ``Naturally, it was
the Kennedy name. The Kennedy family came out in full force,'' he
said.
   St Germain held off a challenge from political consultant Scott
Wolf, who hoped to capitalize on discontent in the district and
recent ethics probes of the House Banking Committee chairman. With
all precincts reporting, St Germain had 26,185 votes, or 55
percent, to Wolf's 21,422, or 45 percent.
   St Germain, who has served 14 terms in the House, refused to
debate and managed his own campaign, driving throughout the
district on the state's east side in one of his beat-up cars.
   In the gubernatorial primary, Sundlun, a communications
executive, overwhelmed home-education activist Peter Van Daam to
oppose DiPrete, who seeks a third, two-year term. With all
precincts reporting, Sundlun had 66,231 votes, or 90 percent, to
Van Daam's 7,221, or 10 percent.
   DiPrete heads toward November defending himself against
allegations that members of his administration were allowed to
intervene in land deals involving DiPrete's sons. The governor, who
is campaigning on a theme of improving Rhode Island's economy, has
denied the allegations.

   Rickety dune shacks on Cape Cod that
provided a retreat for artists and writers such as Eugene O'Neill
and Jack Kerouac belong on the National Register of Historic
Places, says a state commission.
   With the Massachusetts Historical Commission's unanimous
recommendation Wednesday, the register must decide whether to grant
historic status to the 18 shacks and list them along with Mount
Vernon and Monticello.
   A vocal group of supporters argues that the shacks are no less
significant to the state and the nation.
   ``Just as Thoreau taught us the value of living simply, so do
the cottages,'' said Julie Schecter, a member of a Cape Cod group
fighting to preserve the shacks. ``The cottages continue to let
people live in the same way that early dune dwellers lived.''
   Three shacks were razed recently, according to Gail Cohen, who
has lobbied for their preservation. The National Park Service
planned to tear down the remaining 18, arguing that they lack
architectural significance required of buildings placed on the
national register.
   The shacks are nestled in a two-mile strip of dunes in Truro and
Provincetown at the far end of the Cape. The Coast Guard built them
around the turn of the century of rough wood and salvage material.
   They were used as shelters from harsh coastal weather. In the
1920s, as Provincetown attracted artists and writers, they became
retreats. In 1961, with the creation of the Cape Cod National
Seashore, the shacks became part of the park service domain.
   Artist Joyce Johnson of Truro, who has painted in a dune shack
off and on for 15 years, told the commission it is no surprise to
her that so many writers have done their best work there.
   ``The sometimes overwhelming awareness of nature _ the wind,
sound of the sea, songs of birds _ allow the creative forces to
clarify and congeal in ideas that might take months in another
space,'' Johnson said.
   The final decision will be made in 45 days, according to Beth
Savage, an architectural historian from the register who will be
responsible for the decision.
   ``Architectural significance is only one way you get on the
register,'' Savage said. ``If the shacks played a significant role
in the history and development of the area, then sure, there's a
possibility.''

   A jury has recommended life in prison without
parole for a man convicted of murdering five people during a
supermarket holdup in which two gunmen entered after closing time,
apparently by posing as a cleaning crew.
   The jury deliberated about four hours Wednesday before deciding
on the penalty against Marvin Jennings, 27, of Overland.
Prosecutors had sought the death penalty.
   A security guard and four employees were killed in the 1987
robbery. Six employees were ordered to lie on the floor and shot in
the back of the head; two survived, police said.
   The other suspect, Donnie Blankenship, 26, of Hanley Hills, has
yet to stand trial.

   Opposition leaders appealed today for
restraint by student activists seeking more violent means to topple
the authoritarian government of President Maung Maung.
   Tens of thousands of demonstrators again filled the streets of
Rangoon.
   Sources said one student group went to the U.S. Embassy on
Wednesday asking for weapons, and another group said it had 5,000
people ready to take up arms. An embassy official told the group
the United States could offer only moral support, said the sources,
who demanded anonymity.
   Some students have called for volunteers to undergo training in
military tactics.
   Tens of thousands of people, including several thousand high
school students, marched in the capital today. One estimate put the
total at 100,000.
   A one-legged man with a crutch led a group of about 50 ill-clad,
apparently homeless men carrying a banner that said: ``Pavement
Dwellers, Suicide Squad.''
   ``We are prepared to die for democracy. We have nothing to
lose,'' the middle-aged man told a reporter.
   The three main opposition leaders, former Brig. Gen. Aung Gyi,
former Defense Minister Tin Oo, and Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of
independence leader Aung San, issued a joint statement condemning
violence.
   ``The people including the students should continue peaceful
demonstrations and general strikes steadfastly using the weapon of
moral courage, as was the original intention,'' it said. ``Violence
arising out of impatience and overzealousness and further bloodshed
should be avoided.''
   Street demonstrations have become increasingly militant in
recent days.
   ``You run or we will kill you!'' marchers shouted Wednesday,
jabbing fists in the air as they used more militant and threatening
slogans than before. ``If they don't fall, make them fall,'' they
chanted.
   More than 100,000 people marched that day through the streets of
Rangoon.
   The student-led street protests have forced one concession after
another from Maung Maung's one-party government in recent weeks,
but the opposition has persisted in demands an interim government
be immediately formed to supervise a general election. The
opposition, which is comprised of students, Buddhist monks,
government workers and others, also has called for an an end to the
party's repression and ruinous economic policies.
   Maung Maung's government announced last weekend it would end the
Burma Socialist Program Party's 26-year monopoly on power and hold
the first multiparty elections since 1960. The polling could be as
early as late October.
   But the three opposition leaders told the state-appointed
election commission Tuesday they would not accept any polling
organized by the current government. They said they would not
support or participate in such elections, and repeated their demand
for an interim government.
   Rangoon newspapers reported today that Capt. Sai Win Kyaw of the
22nd Light Infantry Brigade held a news conference the previous day
and charged the army had been exploited by the government. He
called on all members of the army to resign.
   At least 500 soldiers slipped out of their barracks Sept. 9 and
joined the demonstrators, and others are believed disallusioned
over the high living of senior officers while combat soldiers are
sent out to fight rebels with outdated weapons.
   Meanwhile, more than 90 people, including students and workers,
sat on bamboo mats on the pavement outside City Hall and began a
72-hour hunger strike at the spot where where the military shot
dead several demonstrators Aug. 8.
   They followed about 75 protesters who ended a 48-hour hunger
strike there in the morning, and more than 1,000 schoolchildren who
completed a 36-hour fast Monday night at the Rangoon General
Hospital compound.
   In beginning the series of hunger strikes, the opposition has
revived a tactic employed several decades ago in fighting British
colonial rule.
   The country's last multiparty elections, on Feb. 6, 1960, swept
former Prime Minister Nu to power over an army-backed party. He was
toppled in the 1962 coup led by Ne Win, who isolated the nation and
pursued rigid socialist policies that made resource-rich Burma one
of the world's poorest nations.
   Massive protests began after Ne Win resigned July 23 and the
party named hardliner Sein Lwin his successor. Sein Lwin resigned
17 days later after at least 112 people died during rioting in
Rangoon Aug. 8-12.
   On Aug. 19, Maung Maung became Burma's first civilian leader
since Nu.

   Charges have been dropped against an
89-year-old woman who found $100 on a bus and tried to apply the
playground rule ``Finders, keepers.''
   Anna Philips of East Hartford was arrested Sept. 2 when she
refused to give a Connecticut Transit driver or Glastonbury police
the money found in an envelope on a bus seat on her way to cash her
Social Security check.
   The great-grandmother of 17 was charged with failure to perform
the duties of a finder under an obscure law that carries a fine of
$100 and 30 days in jail.
   Assistant State's Attorney Cornelius Shea announced in Superior
Court on Wednesday that the state wouldn't prosecute.
   ``The police are in possession of the money,'' he said. ``If the
owner doesn't come forward, the money will be given to the finder.''
   ``The ends of justice have been met,'' he said.

   NASA says it still hopes to launch
Discovery this month but is delaying setting a date because
Hurricane Gilbert could disrupt operations at the flight control
center in Houston.
   In making the announcement Wednesday, the space agency also
cited uncertainty about a small hydrogen leak detected in the space
shuttle's main engine propulsion system, a problem not considered
serious.
   Engineers solved that problem today, NASA said.
   Rear Adm. Richard Truly, NASA's associate administrator for
space flight, said Friday is the earliest a launch date would be
set. He said Sept. 26 is the earliest possible target for launching
Discovery and its five-man crew.
   The hurricane, which churned in the Gulf of Mexico today, was on
a course that could take it to the Texas coast near Houston. NASA's
Johnson Space Center is located south of Houston, 30 miles inland
from the gulf.
   ``We don't know where the hurricane is going, but we thought it
best to wait a day or so, or whatever it takes to make a
decision,'' Truly said.
   ``Even though Houston doesn't get hit, it is a threat to
Houston, and we have people there who have to turn attention to
their homes and families, just as other people along the Texas
coast are doing,'' Truly said.
   Once a shuttle is launched, the mission is controlled from the
Johnson center. Earlier storms in that area have caused flooding,
disrupting communications and computer operations at the center.
   Truly spoke to reporters at the conclusion of a two-day flight
readiness review during which more than 150 shuttle managers and
engineers and outside experts evaluated the shuttle's systems and
the preparedness of launch and flight control teams.
   Truly said he polled the 15 key NASA and contractor managers at
the conclusion of the review, ``and there wasn't a dissenting vote
to launch. ... We're in a very positive situation.''
   The review was to have established a firm launch date for the
first shuttle mission since Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986,
killing the crew of seven. Officials were considering a date
between Sept. 26 and 29.
   Truly reported the only open technical issue was a tiny leak
detected in Discovery's engine propulsion system during a pressure
check last week. He said the exact location of the leak had not
been determined.
   ``We see a small leak. We don't believe it is serious. It's the
only unknown we have right now,'' said Forrest S. McCartney,
director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Kennedy Space Center.
   McCartney said engineers believe it might be in ground support
equipment and that they felt it would be easy to isolate and
correct without affecting a late September launch.

<HEAD>Premier Plans Divorce After Heart Surgery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KERIN HOPE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou plans to
divorce his American-born wife, Margaret, when he returns to Greece
after undergoing heart surgery in London, the government said today.
   On Wednesday, the 69-year-old premier was pictured in Greek
newspapers strolling hand-in-hand with his 34-year-old girlfriend,
airline stewardess Dimitra Liani.
   Papandreou is awaiting surgery to replace a heart valve. No date
has been set for the operation at Harefield Hospital in London, but
his doctors say it probably will take place later this month.
   The Socialist premier flew to London three weeks ago for
treatment of a narrowing in the aorta, the main artery carrying
blood from the heart.
   Asked about a divorce, government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos
told Greek reporters ``when the premier returns the process of
dissolving his marriage will be set in motion.''
   Papandreou's doctors have said that if the operation is
successful he can return to Athens after a two-week recovery period
and resume work two months later.
   Mrs. Papandreou, 65, who heads a socialist feminist group, the
Women's Organization of Greece, made no immediate comment on the
divorce announcement.
   Papandreou married the former Margaret Chant of Elmhurst, Ill.,
in 1951, when he was teaching economics at the University of
Minnesota. They have four children and two grandchildren. Their
eldest son, George, 37, serves as minister of education in the
government.
   The spokesman did not say whether the premier plans to marry Ms.
Liani, who works for Greece's state-run carrier Olympic Airways.
Ms. Liani, the daughter of a Greek Army officer, is married to an
architect, Athanassios Kapopoulos.

<TEXT>
   Operators of a sludge-laden barge outsmarted 13
Greenpeace demonstrators who attempted to stop it by swinging from
ropes beneath the Triborough Bridge _ the vessel simply took
another route to sea to dump its load.
   The demonstrators tied up traffic on the bridge and the East
River before climbing back up shortly before 2 a.m. today, eight
hours after they lowered themselves from the span and unfurled a
huge banner reading, ``Stop Ocean Dumping Now.''
   Andrew Davis, spokesman for the worldwide ecological group, said
the protesters had hoped to block barges carrying treated sewage
sludge for dumping 106 miles at sea.
   They dangled some 100 feet above the water, forcing the Coast
Guard to stop all traffic from passing under the bridge, said Coast
Guard spokesman Joe Gibson.
   But the barge departed as scheduled shortly before midnight,
traveling north via Long Island Sound to the ocean instead of
south, said Lt. Cmdr. Larry Brooks.
   ``We couldn't let them transit under the bridge because of the
safety to these people,'' Brooks said. ``So they asked if it was OK
to take an alternative route and we thought it was perfectly
suitable.''
   Police Sgt. Ed Burns said 13 people who swung from the bridge
and 11 others who assisted were arrested and would be charged with
criminal trespass, disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental
administration, all misdemeanors.
   On Tuesday, five Greenpeace members were arrested after they
chained a dinghy to the rear of a sewage barge and a protester to a
mooring line, police said.

   Firefighters mopping up a 939,270-acre blaze in Yellowstone
National Park today braced for warmer weather that could heat
things up as Army reinforcements eager to join the battle against a
giant fire arrived in Montana.
   ``We have been leaning forward in the saddle,'' Col. Beau
Bergeron said as 900 soldiers from Fort Lewis, Wash., arrived
Wednesday to help fight a 247,000-acre blaze in west-central
Montana.
   Nine hundred more soldiers were to arrive today, swelling the
ranks of firefighters wrestling with the blaze to 3,000. The
soldiers might allow officials to release some of the tired regular
firefighters later today or Friday.
   Fires also burned in California, Idaho, Oregon, Washington and
Idaho.
   California's Gold Rush country in the Sierra Nevada enjoyed a
second day of favorable weather, bringing firefighters closer to
containing a 52-square-mile timber and brush fire that destroyed 97
homes and 60 other buildings.
   ``Everything is looking really good and really calm,''
California Department of Forestry spokeswoman Erin Connelly said.
   Officials said they expected to contain the fire today, and
begin sending most of the 2,778 firefighters and support workers
fighting the blaze home.
   A drifter accused of starting the fire by burning toilet paper,
initially charged with the misdemeanor of illegal burning, was to
be arraigned today on a felony count of reckless burning, said
Nevada County District Attorney John Darlington.
   If convicted, Gary Wayne Parris, 39, could be sentenced to up to
four years in prison, Darlington said.
   Wildfires have scorched more than 4 million acres in what has
been called the nation's worst fire season in 30 years.
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis was to visit
Yellowstone today to view fire damage to the 2.2 million-acre park
and meet with firefighters, residents and Western governors.
   Aides said Dukakis would meet with Montana Gov. Ted Schwinden,
Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan and Idaho Gov.
Cecil Andrus.
   Aides said Dukakis was not expected to take a position on
whether the Reagan administration was wrong to let the Yellowstone
fires burn unchecked until mid-July under the National Park
Service's longstanding ``let-burn'' policy.
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel, who toured Yellowstone last
weekend, said Wednesday the policy was being revised.
   For the 7,200 Army and civilian firefighters at Yellowstone,
Wednesday was fourth day of rainy, cold weather that has put a
damper on blazes in and around the park. But today's forecast
called for temperatures in the 70s.
   The fires in the oldest national park have grown into a single
huge blaze and have not been contained, but officials said
firefighters attacking hot spots and strengthening fire lines were
in the ``mop-up'' phase.
   ``The weather has really knocked this down,'' said fire boss
Denny Bungarz, cautioning that blazes have surprised fire crews
before. ``This is ... tricky.''
   Northeast of the park, firefighters mopped up a 93,000-acre fire
near Cooke City and Silver Gate, Mont.
   ``We're trying to get in and give it a good kick in the pants
before it kicks us back'' if conditions worsen, said fire
information officer Bob McHugh.
   At Montana's Glacier National Park near the Canadian border,
managers held firefighters off the lines for a second night
Wednesday because of the danger from falling trees, which have
killed one firefighter and injured at least a dozen.
   ``It was primarily just a patrol with engines around the
lines,'' fire information officer Stephanie Gibert said at the fire
camp.
   In north-central Idaho, firefighters burned a 2,000-acre fire
line to protect the Whitewater Ranch from a 44,950-acre blaze in
the Nez Perce National Forest. In the Challis National Forest to
the south, a backcountry landing strip was closed because of
several near-collisions between fire helicopters and private
aircraft.
   In Oregon, dense smoke hampered efforts to fight a 5,000-acre
fire in the Willamette National Forest, and some firefighters even
had trouble finding the blaze, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman
Norm Hesseldahl.
   ``It was a pretty frustrating day,'' Hesseldahl said.

   Sixteen Americans were jailed today
after staging demonstrations against U.S. policy in Central
America, a police official said.
   Police arrested the protesters in front of the U.S. Embassy in
Tegucigalpa and the U.S. air base at Palmerola, about 40 miles
northwest of the capital, said Maj. Manuel Urbina, spokesman for
the Public Security Forces. He said they would probably be deported.
   Urbina said four of the protesters were being held at the
Casamata prison in Tegucigalpa and the other 12 at a police jail in
Comayagua, four miles away.
   In a similar protest in Guatemala City on Wednesday, four
Americans threw blood on the steps of the U.S. Embassy, chained
themselves to the gates of the compound and demanded an audience
with the U.S. ambassador, James Michel.
   No arrests were reported in connection with the Guatemala
protest.
   The demonstrations were organized by a group called Project
Independence and held one day before today's celebration of the
anniversary of Central America's independence from Spain in 1821.
   John Mateyko, a spokesman for the group in Washington, said the
protest was ``religious-based and non-violent'' against what he
called ``the immoral and dangerous policy'' of the Reagan
administration in Central America.
   Mateyko identified the four demonstrators in Tegucigalpa as John
Bach, 41, of Hartford, Conn.; Teri Allen, 30, of Hartford; Patricia
McCallum, 47, of Cambridge, Mass., and Mark Fryer, 31, of West
Creek, N.J.
   The names of those being held in Comayagua were not immediately
available.
   Mateyko identified the demonstrators in Guatemala City as
Charley Litky, 57, a Congressional Medal of Honor winner for his
service as a Roman Catholic priest in Vietnam, and Sara Story, 26,
both of Washington, D.C.; Dale Ashera-Davis, 34, of Baltimore, Md.;
and John Schuchardt, 49, of Leverett, Mass.
   ``At this time of remembering Central American independence from
Spain we've come to join with Central Americans in declaring its
independence from U.S. domination,'' a declaration read by the
group said.
   ``In eight years neither (President) Reagan or (Vice President
George) Bush seems to have figured out that that's all these people
want,'' it said.

   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
said today that Israel and Hungary have agreed to gradually restore
diplomatic ties after a 21-year break and pledged close contacts
with central Europe's largest Jewish community.
   Shamir, on a private visit to Hungary, is making the first trip
by an Israeli prime minister to a Soviet bloc country other than
Romania since 1967.
   He is also the first Israeli government leader to visit Hungary
since the establishment of the Jewish state in 1948. His aide
Aviezer Pazner termed the two-day visit an ``important milestone''
for relations between Israel and the Soviet bloc, and said
diplomatic ties will be restored.
   On Wednesday, Shamir met with Communist Party leader and Premier
Karoly Grosz in the highest-level bilateral contact since all
Soviet bloc nations except Romania broke diplomatic ties with
Israel in 1967 over the Six Day War.
   Today, Shamir reported that Grosz favors ``close contact between
Israel and the Jewish community in Hungary.''
   ``Accordingly we will try to establish very close contacts,''
Shamir pledged in a lunchtime toast delivered in Hebrew to about a
dozen Jewish community leaders.
   Pazner said relations between Hungary and Israel are getting
closer and ``will result at some point in full diplomatic
relations.''
   He gave no timetable for establishing full diplomatic ties, but
said the two countries had ``reached the point when we feel the
moment of full normalization can't be too far away.''
   Pazner said there was no reason why ``Israel and Hungary and all
countries of the Socialist bloc shouldn't have normal relations.''
   Shamir's stay in Budapest was described as a private working
visit. But he met Grosz, Foreign Minister Peter Varkonyi and Deputy
Premier Jozsef Marjai.
   In September 1987, Hungary became the second Soviet bloc state
after Poland to renew low-level diplomatic relations with Israel.
Last March, economic interest sections were set up by both
countries at the Swedish Embassy in Tel Aviv and the Swiss Embassy
in Budapest.
   The movement toward renewed ties comes as Israel agreed to begin
assisting Hungary in the economic and industrial development
fields. nflation in Hungary already has reached 18 percent this
year and the country has a foreign debt of $18 billion.
   Grosz has introduced an austerity program to stimuate the
economy. In 1986, trade between Hungary and Israel totaled about
$22 million.
   The president of Hungary's state office for church affairs, Imre
Miklos, visited Israel earlier this month and Israel's Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres came to Budapest in May.
   Andras Losoenci, the president of Hungary's Jewish community,
which numbers about 80,000, said Shamir's visit to Budapest's main
synagogue, the largest in central Europe, was ``of historic
significance.''
   He recalled that 600,000 Hungarian Jews were killed by the Nazis
in World War II.
   ``It's difficult now not to think that if Israel was founded 50
years ago, and not 40, you would represent not 80,000 Jews but 1
million,'' Shamir told about a dozen Jewish community leaders in a
lunchtime toast.
   About 240,0000 Jews of Hungarian origin live in Israel.
   Shamir stopped at the synagogue and paid tribute to Raoul
Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who helped Hungarian Jews escape
the Holocaust and disappeared after being captured by the Soviets
in January 1945.
   Security was very tight during the brief visit to the memorial.

   The International Olympic Committee
today awarded the 1994 Winter Games to the Norwegian city of
Lillehammer, dashing U.S. hopes of hosting the Games in Anchorage,
Alaska.
   In the Norwegian city of 22,000, people danced in the streets
and were served free breakfast along the main street as they
celebrated the announcement.
   ``This is an enormeous challenge for all Norway and especially
for Lillehammer and the districts around,'' said Prime Minister Gro
Harlem Brundtland in Oslo, 112 miles away.
   Lillehammer has been given a preliminary budget of $312 million
to stage games, the Norwegian government said.
   The announcement was made by IOC President Juan Antonio
Samaranch following a vote by members of the organization.
   Lillehammer will become the second Norwegian city to host the
Winter Games. Oslo organized the 1952 Games.
   Mrs. Brundtland of Norway was in Seoul this week lobbying for
Lillehammer among members of the IOC. She called Norway the
``cradle of winter sports'' and praised Lillehammer's compact
sports center.
   Sofia, Bulgaria, had been widely expected to be chosen as the
first East bloc nation to hold the games based on the strong
support from its allies.
   Anchorage and Ostersund, Sweden, were the other contenders for
1994.
   When Samaranch made his announcement following a vote by the
86-member body, a group of Norwegian representatives in the crowd
shouted in joy and waved their country's flag.
   Lillehammer is the smallest of the contending cities and is
located on Lake Mjoesa, Norway's largest lake.
   The city has already begun building a sports center that offers
compact facilities that will not necessitate extensive travel by
competing teams.
   The IOC voted in 1986 to stagger the Winter and Summer Olympics,
and Lillehammer will be the first to host the new once-in-two-years
cycle.
   Sweden submitted a bid the last four times for the Winter Games
and the country has tried 12 times in all to be a Winter Olympics
host.
   The four cities made their final presentations Wednesday, using
speeches, films and slide shows to try to convince the IOC that
their bid was best. Anchorage, Lillehammer and Sofia all were
losers two years ago when Albertville, France, was awarded the
Winter Games for 1992.

   The Reagan administration's top health
official said today there are ``some good pros and some good cons''
to using aborted fetal tissue in the experimental treatment of
various diseases.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen told reporters
he has not taken a position on the controversial issue of whether
to recommend federal backing for such research and does not expect
to until a National Institutes of Health advisory committee has
completed a full review of the matter.
   Bowen's comments were his first since the disclosure last week
that Gary Bauer, a White House domestic policy adviser, had drafted
an executive order that would ban using tissue from intentionally
aborted fetuses in research.
   Bauer told Bowen in an accompanying memo that he would like the
secretary's response by last Friday because White House officials
wanted to put the ban into effect as soon as possible.
   Bowen said today that ``we have not responded'' and added that
he did not intend to make any recommendations until the NIH panel
has completed its work.
   Asked if he considered the Bauer memo an order from the White
House, Bowen said, ``I do not know whether it was a direct order
from the president and I don't know that I will know unless someone
tells me.''
   One day after the Bauer memo was disclosed, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the draft executive order was just
a starting point for discussions and did not represent an official
white House position.
   Bowen emphasized that he does not approve of abortion, but
added, ``Inasmuch as abortions are legal, being unable to utilize
the tissue ... would result in the waste of a resource that is
lifesaving and curing for several diseases.''
   At the same time he said there are some ``big dangers'' in the
widespread use of such treatment, including the ``possibility for a
sale of fetal tissue by those who intentionally become pregnant and
then have an abortion with the intent to sell the tissue. That
would be totally wrong.''
   Bowen's remarks came during an informal breakfast meeting with
reporters as the NIH panel he referred to was beginning its second
day of hearings, focusing on some of the same ethical issues raised
by Bowen.
   A ban against federal financing of such research is likely to
remain in effect for several months at least.
   The NIH panel of outside experts, consisting of medical, legal
and religious leaders, is scheduled to make recommendations Friday,
which will be passed on to a standing NIH advisory committee and,
ultimately, NIH Director James B. Wyngaarden.
   The three-day meeting of the special advisory panel that started
Wednesday was an outgrowth of a decision by the No. 2 official at
the Department of Health and Human Services, Assistant Secretary
for Health Robert E. Windom, to deny permission for NIH scientists
to transplant fetal tissue into Parkinson's patients pending a full
airing of legal and ethical questions.
   Leatrice Ducat, founder of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and
now operator of a non-profit organ exchange operation headquartered
in Philadelphia, told the group she favored much wider research
using fetal tissue for diabetes and other diseases.
   However, she said her organization does not collect and
distribute fetal tissue to researchers now ``because the emotional
climate'' which makes hospitals and other institutions where
abortions are performed ``reluctant to donate fetal tissue.''
   William F. Colliton, a retired gynecologist and obstetrician
representing Right to Life of Maryland, appeared before the panel
to oppose the research.
   ``This proposition further devalues our preborn brothers and
sisters and lends an aura of respectability to the elective killing
of these patients who today have no protection under the law,'' he
said.
   Dr. Myron Genel, a pediatrics professor and associate dean for
government and community affairs at the Yale University School of
Medicine, told the committee the Association of American Medical
Colleges and the Association of American Universities favor fetal
tissue transplant research with proper safeguards.
   ``While the decision to halt federal involvement in this
research was guided by ethical concerns, equally compelling ethical
concerns are raised by proposals to enjoin this research
permanently and thereby to preclude the alleviation of suffering
and illness in the living,'' Genel said.
   Although not spelled out, his reference to proposals for a
permanent ban apparently referred to a proposed White House
executive order distributed to federal officials. The document,
disclosed by news reports last week, had not been intended for
public consumption.
   Genel's suggestion that ethical questions also would be raised
by a permanent ban echoed the sentiments expressed earlier
Wednesday by a Swedish physician who is one of the few people in
the world to have transplanted fetal tissue into the brains of
Parkinson's patients.
   Dr. Lars Olson, professor of neurobiology at Karolinska
Institute in Stockholm, told the panel the technique also has been
used in Mexico, China, England and Cuba.
   There are no known cases of fetal tissue being transplanted as a
treatment for Parkinson's disease in the United18.

<BYLINE>MEXICO: Historic Copper Mine Back on the Market</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   MONTERREY, Mexico _ The copper-mining town of Cananea has come
to symbolize the birth of Mexico's nationalist spirit in the 82
years since a bloody strike pitted Mexican workers against an

Jessica Hahn, Rita Jenrette and Debra Murphree did. Getting
scandal-entangled women to bare all is a major coup for men's

<HEAD>Dukakis Courting Strong Defense Image But Jury Still Out</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 18th graf, Dukakis restated, to better describe position
on B-1</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afer donning a military helmet and jump suit and
taking one of the Army's 60-ton M-1 Abrams tanks out for a spin,
Michael Dukakis asked his observers for a review.
   ``What did you think?'' he asked. ``Did I look like I belonged
up there in that tank?''
   The full answer won't be in for a while, though the Democratic
presidential nominee has spent this week doing his utmost to make
the picture of himself perched atop the nation's military machinery
seem reasonable and natural.
   Stung by Republican assaults on him as weak on defense, Dukakis
sounded downright hawkish at times. He delivered three major
addresses that were an attempt to stake out positions of strength
on weapons, U.S.-Soviet relations, and national security _ all the
while presenting himself as no newcomer to toughness.
   ``We're going to have strong strategic forces, we're going to
have strong conventional forces, and we're going to clean up the
mess in the Pentagon,'' he said Wednesday in Annapolis, Md., his
final national security speech before heading West today to view
fire damage in Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., and meet with
Western governors.
   Dukakis was motivated in part by polls suggesting Republican
George Bush has succeeded in raising questions about the Democrat
on defense matters. In a New York Times-CBS News poll this week,
four in 10 voters said Dukakis would weaken the nation's defenses,
while only one in 10 said he would strengthen them.
   What emerged from Dukakis's efforts was a fairly conventional
and unstartling view of East-West relations. The expected
Democratic emphasis on arms control was coupled with tough talk
about Soviet intentions _ he called Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
a ``Leninist'' who has not abandoned Soviet world goals.
   He added to that eyes-open view of the Soviets the prospect that
``improved Soviet behavior in world affairs'' may be achieved by
holding out the carrot of enhanced economic ties and fuller
admission into the world economic community.
   On weapons systems _ the area where Bush has scored points with
his scornful assaults on the Democrat as the ``Stealth candidate''
_ Dukakis's positions appear to be still emerging.
   The Massachusetts governor's ride in the M-1 tank, in a grassy
field by a General Dynamics test and design facility in Sterling
Heights, Mich., on Tuesday, provided the pictures to go along with
his talk of military might. It fit nicely into the area of weaponry
that he most likes to discuss _ his call for improvements in
conventional forces and his accusation that the Reagan
administration has been willing to make sacrifices in personnel and
non-nuclear spending to pay for its Strategic Defense Initiative
and more nuclear arms.
   Dukakis did not, however, answer the question of how he would
modernize the land-based leg of the nation's nuclear triad (land,
air and sea). Nor did he offer specific explanation of how he holds
open the possibility of modernization while opposing the options
that are available.
   Speaking at Georgetown University in Washington on Wednesday, he
ruled out the MX missile deployed on rails as a ``Pearl Harbor
style'' target. He struck a noticeably more favorable note than
before on the proposed smaller Midgetman missile, calling it
strategically ``sound.'' But he dismissed it as too expensive _ and
three times the cost of submarine-based warheads.
   Aides said Dukakis views the question of the next generation of
land-based nuclear missiles as still evolving, and that he would
await further study of those missiles and other, lesser known and
lesser developed possible alternatives as president.
   After blasting ``Republican blue smoke and mirrors'' on nuclear
missiles, Dukakis dismissed the modernization issue this way:
   ``So I'm going to work with the Congress to find a sensible,
affordable way to maintain the effectiveness of the land-based
missile leg of the triad.''
   Dukakis committed himself to production and deployment of the
Stealth bomber, which he pointedly noted was begun under President
Carter. He visited General Electric's Ohio plant where engines for
the Stealth and other aircraft are made, and was met with a chorus
of boos from skeptical workers whose jobs depend on defense
contracts.
   Though he didn't acknowledge it, his pledge to complete the
Stealth appeared to go beyond previous qualified support for
Stealth research that left open a decision on deployment until the
plane is fully tested.
   Dukakis restated his concerns about the B-1 bomber, which he
says is too expensive and unreliable as a bomber capable of
penetrating enemy territory. He pointed to his support for the new
Trident II submarine-based missile and for advanced cruise missiles.
   On SDI, the Star Wars anti-missile defense project, Dukakis
continued to ridicule Reagan administration spending while at the
same time backing $1 billion a year worth of SDI research _ about a
quarter of current spending.
   A week earlier Dukakis raised eyebrows when, at a news
conference after addressing the American Legion, he suggested he
would deploy a Star Wars program if it was ``essential to our
national security.'' But at the same time he said Star Wars
deployment would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty
(ABM), which he said remains in the nation's best interest.
   He has taken what is essentially a middle ground, supporting
some research on the hope a successful defense against nuclear
weapons is possible through technology, while opposing larger
spending that he contends will come out of conventional forces or
other programs.
   In his Georgetown speech, Dukakis spoke of Star Wars as
undermining ``the stability of the nuclear balance.''
   ``If we're going to make our defense dollars count, we've got to
stop pouring billions and billions into this program, and do some
hard thinking about what we're trying to achieve,'' he said.

<HEAD>Israeli Troops Kill Palestinian Boy After Firebomb Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli troops shot and killed an 11-year-old
Palestinian boy after Arab assailants hurled a firebomb at their
jeep in the occupied Gaza Strip, the army said today.
   Troops also shot and wounded four teen-agers, two seriously,
after a group of Palestinian young people threw stones at them in
Nablus, hospital officials said.
   Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron announced violence in the
Israeli-occupied territories had declined in the past two weeks,
despite continuing clashes. He reported 612 cases of ``hostile
activity'' against Israeli targets, down from 1,019 in the previous
two weeks, according to the Davar newspaper.
   In Gaza City on Wednesday, assailants tossed a firebomb from the
Salah Edin mosque at troops on night patrol in a jeep, hitting the
patrol commander in the leg, the army and Arab reports said.
   An army spokesman said the Arab boy was killed when soldiers
opened fire in the direction of the firebomb. Hospital officials
said the boy was shot in the head.
   The fatality brought to 266 the number of Palestinians killed
since the Arab uprising began Dec. 8. Six Israelis also have died.
   In Nablus, an 18-year-old Palestinian was shot in the chest and
a 16-year-old in the stomach. Both were reported in serious
condition, hospital officials said. Two other teen-agers were
slightly wounded, they said.
   The army confirmed that troops shot and wounded three people
during a stone-throwing incident in the markeplace in Nablus and
was checking the report about the fourth casualty.
   In London, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres today
challenged Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to ``make up his mind''
about whether he wants peace with Israel.
   He said Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization was ``in a
confused state,'' torn between proponents of compromise with Israel
and those who wanted to destroy the Jewish state.
   At a news conference winding up a visit to Britain, Peres did
not spell out whether Israel now agreed to talk to the PLO and
accept an independent Palestinian state.
   Peres said Arafat's latest policy pronouncements, during a visit
last week to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, were
``an escape from the issue.''
   Arafat told the European Parliament's socialists that Jordan's
decision to cut its ties to the West Bank would pave the way for an
independent Palestinian state.

<HEAD>Iraq Says Use of Chemical Weapons Impossible, Hints U.N. Team Not

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with Iraq again denying chemical weapons
allegations and not welcoming U.N team. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said today it would have been
technically impossible for the Iraqi Army to use poison gas against
Kurds, as Washington has charged, and indicated Baghdad may not
allow a U.N. probe into the issue.
   Turkey said it would not agree to a U.N. request to send experts
into its country to determine whether Iraq used poison gas against
its Kurdish population.
   ``If the Kurds are Iraqis, it's an internal issue. So what is
the role of the United Nations in this case?'' Iraqi Defense
Minister Adnan Khairallah told a news conference.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar asked the Iraqi
government on Tuesday to let U.N. chemical experts conduct such an
investigation in Iraq.
   Khairallah said the offensive that drove tens of thousands of
Kurds into neighboring Turkey lasted from Aug. 27 to Sept. 5 and
cleaned out insurgents from a strip three to 12 miles wide along
the border.
   ``If it (gas) was used as the American media claims, it was
technically impossible, particularly in the mountainous area,'' he
said.
   The minister said chemical weapons create a heavy gas which
would have clung to the valleys and made it impossible for Iraqi
troops to enter the area.
   ``The area does not need to be attacked in such a way,'' he said.
   He said the strip was too narrow to use such weapons, which
``should not be used in an area of less than 50 square kilometers
(19 square miles).''
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz acknowledged on July 1 that
his country had used deadly chemical weapons in its 8-year-old war
with Iran but he claimed the Iranians had used them first.
   The United Nations and other international bodies have several
times censured Iraq and Iran for using chemical weapons in the
conflict.
   ``The general rule is not to use it,'' Khairallah said. But ``if
there is this rule, then each rule has an exception.''
   Khairallah appeared to mute Iraqi criticism of the United States
over last Friday's Senate vote to impose economic sanctions against
his country over use of chemical weapons.
   The U.N. investigation request, prompted by the United States,
Japan, Britain and West Germany, also called for a team of experts
to be sent to Turkey, where 60,000 Kurds fleeing Iraqi attacks have
been given sanctuary.
   In Ankara, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Turkey wouldn't
accept the team.
   ``Although there has been no official request made to Turkey
yet, our answer is negative for any future attempt of this sort,''
Inal Batu, the spokesman, told reporters at a weekly briefing
Wednesday.
   Batu said Turkey had uncovered no evidence of gas attacks.
   ``Turkey has repeatedly condemned the use of chemical weapons
during the Iran-Iraq war,'' Batu said. ``But, in our examination of
those given sanctuary we found no evidence to support these
claims'' of poison gas use.
   Batu said only two Kurdish refugees had returned to Iraq so far
following a proclamation of amnesty by Iraq for the Kurds.
   About 20 million Kurds who live in a region where the borders of
Turkey, Iran and Iraq converge have been fighting for independence
for the past century.
   After Iran and Iraq declared a cease-fire in their 8-year-old
war beginning Aug. 20, Iraq turned on Kurdish guerrillas. The
Kurds, claiming Iraq was bombing their settlements with chemical
gas, fled into Turkey.

<HEAD>Gain Is Fourth In A Row</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American industry operated at 83.7 percent of
capacity in August, the fourth consecutive monthly increase and the
highest level in more than eight years.
   But the slight 0.1 percentage point increase from July did not
raise concerns about inflation because it was attributed entirely
to a surge in activity at utilities producing electricity to power
air conditioners during the summer heat wave.
   The Federal Reserve Board said the overall operating rate at
U.S. factories, mines and utilities was the highest since March
1980, when it was also 83.7 percent. The 0.1 percent gain followed
a much sharper 0.6 percent rise in July.
   It was the fourth increase in a row at utilities, where rates
rose from 80.7 percent in July to 82.4 percent in August. The 86.9
percent operating rate at electrical utilities in August was last
exceeded in 1979.
   However, the operating rate for manufacturing plants eased in
August to 83.8 percent, down 0.1 percent from the month before. The
rate for the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling,
fell from 83.0 percent in July to 82.9 percent.
   Analysts have been worried by a steady rise in operating rates
at factories, fearing that prices would rise if shortages occurred
because manufacturers had to strain to produce both exports and
goods for U.S. consumers.
   Economists believe an overall operating rate of 85 percent
clearly signals a pickup in inflation.
   The rate at factories making durable goods, ``big ticket'' items
expected to last three or more years, held steady at 82.3 percent
in August, while the rate at factories producing non-durable goods
fell from 86.1 percent in July to 85.9 percent.

   Michael K. Deaver's attorneys presented
evidence today that the former White House aide's judgment and
memory were impaired by alcoholism when questioned under oath about
his lobbying activities.
   The evidence that Deaver was an alcoholic ``at all times
relevant to this case'' was offered to give the ``court
understanding of the offense behavior for which Mr. Deaver was
convicted,'' defense attorney Randall J. Turk told U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
   The former deputy White House chief of staff and close friend of
President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, is scheduled to be sentenced
Sept. 23 for three counts of lying under oath about his lobbying
activities.
   He could receive up to five years and a $6,800 fine for each of
the three convictions.
   Testimony by doctors who treated Deaver for alcoholism shortly
after he left the White House in May, 1985, would show Deaver's
memory was impaired both by alcohol withdrawal sedatives he was
given while hospitalized for two days, Turk said.
   It was during this period that Deaver had telephone contacts
with Reagan administration officials about Trans World Airlines'
attempt to stop a takeover bid by financier Carl Icahn, according
to evidence at the trial.
   Deaver was found guilty, among other things, of saying he
couldn't recall any contacts with then-Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, her deputy, James Burnley and Roger Porter, a White
House aide.
   ``Possibly all of the three contacts took place while he was in
the hospital, while he was going through acute alcohol withdrawal
and while he was sedated,'' Turk said.
   The doctors would say that Deaver's subsequent ``failure to
recall what he was doing at the time was quite understandable.''
   But independent counsel Whitney North Seymour Jr. argued that
Deaver's treatment records would show ``there is nothing to support
any finding that his memory was impaired.''
   ``Mr. Deaver's ability to recall was absolutely functioning, it
was just that he decided to select what he wanted to recall,'' said
Seymour, who is expected to call a medical expert to rebut
testimony Deaver's lawyers plan to present during the two-day
proceeding.
   Turk said that Deaver had been an alcoholic for many years
before he sought treatment and that both his parents are recovering
alcoholics.
   Before he testified in May, 1986 before a House subcommittee,
Deaver took a Valium tablet that doctors say may have impaired his
memory when questioned about his lobbying activities, Turk said.
   Deaver was convicted of one count of lying to the House Energy
and Commerce investigations subcommittee. The other two perjury
convictions stem from statements he made to a grand jury that was
impaneled after Deaver requested an independent counsel to
investigate charges he violated conflict-of-interest laws by
lobbying former Reagan administration colleagues.

(liberal) of Rome, Sept. 14: ``Just 50 days from the elections it
is still not clear which America _ isolationist, protectionist,
attacking or retreating _ President Bush or President Dukakis has
in mind.
   ``The answer ... is not in their words but in their actions.
Each is trying to conquer ... the same part of the voters. They are
both eyeing what once was called `the center' and today is defined
as the `Reagan Democrats'. ...
   ``Bush is afraid of being unmasked and seen as he really is, an
elitist and aristocratic Republican, not a reactionary one and far
away from the Reaganist populism. ...
   ``Dukakis doesn't dare to present himself as the `liberal' he
has always been, someone who believes in a reasoned but strong role
of the public hand in the economic and civic life of the nation.''

   _Monica Riedler writing in Die Presse (conservative) of Vienna,
Sept. 15: ``After weeks of discussions the two presidential
candidates, George Bush and Michael Dukakis, have agreed on holding
two TV debates, but now there is a dispute about whether the two of
them should debate standing or sitting.
   ``A ridiculous problem, but it's symptomatic of the current
election campaign in the U.S. in which real topics have hardly
played a role, while insults (have) much more.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WEST GERMANY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Sueddeutsche Zeitung (independent) of Munich, Sept. 14:
``Dukakis is vulnerable to the Republican attack on his lack of
foreign policy experience. Dukakis has the bad luck not to have
been part of the broad public majority that supported the Reagan
administration's military interventions over the years. ...
   ``That is an admirable, but dangerous weakness. ... Indeed, his
notion that foreign policy should be carried out according to
international rules of the game has no sex appeal with the voters.
   ``The more America's role in the world is brought to the fore in
the campaign, the more points George Bush will collect.''

   _Der Stern (left-leaning national news magazine), Sept. 12:
``George Bush has stepped out of Ronald Reagan's shadow. Reagan's
vice president is campaigning against his Democratic opponent with
self-confidence and media-consciousness.
   ``Mr. Bush has become much more aggressive and visible.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ISRAEL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Yediot Ahronot (conservative) of Tel Aviv, Sept. 14: ``The
reason for the relatively small gap between the two candidates is
that the middle class, even though it is generally satisfied with
its situation, is nervous and concerned about the future.
   ``The real campaign is beginning only now. The television
campaign has not yet begun and the two television debates, between
Bush and Dukakis, and vice presidential candidates Bentsen and
Quayle, have yet to take place.
   Dukakis has a reputation for being a better debater (than Bush)
and Bentsen also seems to have an advantage over the younger
Quayle. The general feeling is that if anything happens to the
president, Bentsen is far more suited to take over than Quayle.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the federal government's judicial
branch said today they want Congress to create 73 new judgeships,
but a judicial spokesman said, ``The realities are that nothing
will happen during an election year.''
   The U.S. Judicial Conference, which sets policy for the nation's
federal courts, voted to request the new judgeships as a means of
eliminating backlogs and easing workloads, spokesman David Sellers
said.
   ``Case filings have increased,'' Sellers said, noting that the
last increase in the judicial workforce was in 1984 when Congress
authorized creation of 86 judgeships.
   The conference, 28 judges who act as a board of directors for
the federal courts, approved the judgeship request in a closed
meeting Wednesday.
   The request seeks 14 new appeals court judges and 59 trial
judges, but 22 of the trial judgeships would last only five years.
   The conference in 1986 sought 56 additional trial court judges
and 13 appeals court judges _ a proposal that went nowhere in
Congress.
   The request announced today represents an adjustment of the 1986
request.
   There currently are 158 appeals court judges and 548 trial
judges.
   Sellers said the Judicial Conference also approved spending
$70,000 to $90,000 on closed-circuit television cameras to monitor
``high risk'' trials.
   He said stationary cameras capable of scanning a courtroom will
be installed in 10 or 12 major cities. The cameras will provide a
video monitor feed to a marshal's office.
   The U.S. Marshals Service proposed the security measure.
   The conference also authorized a two-year experiment in making
videotapes the formal record of court proceedings.
   The experiment, to be conducted in six trial courts and two
appeals courts, is noteworthy because federal courts ban electronic
coverage of courtroom proceedings.
   Sellers said the experiment, patterned after a program already
in place in Kentucky state courts, is aimed at determining whether
videotapes should replace written records. During the experiment,
videotaping will supplement a stenographic record.
   Public access to the videotapes is ``something that has not been
determined yet,'' Sellers said.

   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle said today he was not worried about either Michael Dukakis'
comments or a new poll concerning doubts about his qualifications
for national office.
   ``I am delighted the governor of Massachusetts wants to talk
about my qualifications for being vice president as compared to his
qualifications for being president,'' Quayle said at a news
conference.
   ``He is the one who does not have the comprehension and
understanding of national security issues,'' Quayle said. ``I will
be delighted to compare my qualifications to his.''
   Asked about a new CBS-New York Times poll, in which just
one-third of the respondents said Quayle was qualified to be
president compared to three-fifths who said Democrat Lloyd Bentsen
was, Quayle said:
   ``We're going to continue to talk about the issues of the
campaign. ... In due time the American people are going to see the
real Dan Quayle.''
   The Indiana senator also indicated he was tired of hearing
Dukakis refer to him as J. Danforth Quayle, a tactic the governor
has adopted in recent days. The name, Quayle said, comes from a
friend of his family who was killed in World War II.
   ``That is my namesake. It is not a family name,'' Quayle said.
   One day earlier, Quayle denounced demonstrators at an event in
New Mexico and declared hoarsely after a spirited shouting match
with them: ``I'm just beginning to have fun.''
   The Republican vice presidential candidate's tactic appeared to
mark a change in campaign strategy. Though such protests have
occurred on many of his appearances, most of them have been ignored
or dismissed by the candidate.
   But the event Wednesday at the New Mexico state fair in
Albuquerque turned into a display of the senator's youthful
exuberance. His aides, who acknowledged that the senator had known
the protesters would be present, appeared delighted with the
results.
   ``He just decided to take them on,'' said David Prosperi,
Quayle's spokesman.
   The Indiana senator, who had his first press conference today
since Sept. 1, has had little spontaneous contact with the media
this week during his Midwestern campaign swing.
   Instead, his media events have been limited to the staged
rallies such as those Wednesday in New Mexico and Colorado.
   In Albuquerque, Quayle was serenaded by a pair of Mexican-garbed
balladeers and heralded by a mariache band before he rose to
address a rally of several hundred state fair goers.
   Dozens of people holding Dukakis signs began chanting: ``Go home
Quayle!'' in the most vociferous protests Quayle has faced recently.
   Some held signs reading, ``Quayle Stayed Home to Feather His
Nest'' and ``Quayle Ducked Vietnam,'' a reference to allegations
Quayle pulled strings to get into the National Guard and avoid
combat in Vietnam 20 years ago.
   ``As you listen to this babble over here, you can't help but
think of the Dukakis positions,'' Quayle told the crowd. ``They
have no positions. They're loud but they don't have any ideas.''
   As his supporters cheered, Quayle warmed to the theme, his voice
growing hoarser as he shouted over the chants: ``I'm just beginning
to have fun!''
   ``They have the freedom of speech but so do we and speak we
will,'' he said.
   He denounced the Democrats and their supporters as the ``party
of doom.''
   ``All they can do is say no,'' he said.
   Asked by reporters later if he thought he overreacted to the
crowd, Quayle said, ``No ... We had a good discussion. They have
their right to free speech and so do we.''
   At an earlier rally in Colorado Springs, Colo., Quayle also ran
into hecklers. He said they ``keep walking around in circles''
while ``we have a message to talk about.''
   Quayle's message this week has been to portray Dukakis as
wrongheaded on matters of defense and national security.
   He told a Denver audience that Wednesday's test-launching by the
Soviets of an SS-25 mobile intercontinental ballistic missile
showed the United States needs to develop mobile strategic
missiles, something he said would never happen under Dukakis.
   The Soviets have two mobile ICBM missiles, the SS-25 and the
SS-24.
   The United States does not have mobile intercontinental
ballistic missiles, although two such missiles _ the Midgetman and
the Rail Mobile MX _ have been under development. U.S.
intercontinental ballistic missiles presently are in concrete silos
buried in the ground.
   Dukakis ``is opposing modernization of our land-based missile
force, while the Soviets are already ahead of us,'' Quayle said.
   ``The governor has already stated that he opposes flight testing
of our missiles so even if he wanted to develop a deterrent, his
flight test ban would prevent us from ensuring that the system
would work,'' Quayle said.

<HEAD>Senate Panel OKs Plan to Acquire Shopping Mall Site</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate panel today voted to seize a
development site adjacent to the Manassas National Battlefield Park
in suburban Virginia, rejecting several compromise plans that would
have acquired only part of the parcel.
   The Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved a measure
that would authorize Congress to acquire the entire 542-acre
William Center Development tract, close two heavily-traveled
commuter routes running through the Civil War battlefield and pay
up to $30 million for construction of new roads around the park.
   The measure, introduced by Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., and
identical to a bill that passed the House by a 307-98 vote last
month, prevailed over a compromise measure by Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., that would have acquired just 80 acres of the tract. Warner
claimed that his proposal would preserve the most important
historical aspects of the site at a cheaper price.
   However, Bumpers maintained that the entire tract was
historically significant.
   ``If we don't act to preserve that property, you can go down
there three weeks from now, and it will be gone, for all intents
and purposes,'' Bumpers said in reference to the frenetic building
pace developer John T. Hazel is carrying out on the property.
``It'll be a shopping mall.''
   Warner estimated that his measure would cost only $20 million,
while estimates for the Bumpers proposal are $60 million or higher.
Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., the committee chairman, said he
hoped the bill would reach the Senate floor by next week.
   One potential hangup for the legislation is that it has not gone
through the normal budget process, and could be subject to a
parliamentary challenge on the Senate floor. If such a challenge
arises, 60 votes will be needed to override the procedural question.
   In addition, President Reagan has already threatened to veto any
legislation similar to the Bumpers bill.
   Hazel is planning to build a 1.2 million square-foot shopping
mall, 1.7 million square feet of office space, and 560 homes
adjacent to the 4,200-acre park. Historians claim that the
development, which traffic experts say would generate 80,000 cars
per day, would ruin the historic integrity of the still-rustic
ground on which the First and Second Battles of Manassas were
fought.
   In addition, the development site includes a hill from which
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee commanded his troops in Second
Manassas. Historians also claim that Union and Confederate dead lie
in unmarked graves scattered throughout the development area.

   Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo squeezed out a 71-vote
victory today in a recount in Delaware's Democratic U.S. Senate
primary race, five days after a clerical error left his opponent
claiming to be the winner.
   Woo and his challenger, civil activist Samuel S. Beard,
requested the recount after it was discovered Monday that 2,800
more votes than were actually cast in Saturday's primary had been
credited to Beard.
   Beard had claimed victory after the polls closed, thinking he
had received 22,418 votes to Woo's 19,624.
   But a two-day recount completed early today gave Woo 20,225
votes to Beard's 20,154.
   Woo will challenge Republican U.S. Sen. William V. Roth Jr. in
November. Roth, who had no primary opponent, is seeking a fourth
term.
   ``I know I gave the most upbeat concession speech in the history
of American politics,'' Beard, referring to his remarks over the
weekend, said in conceding today.
   Woo said he lived up to his nickname of ``Landslide Woo,''
conferred after he won the race for lieutenant governor four years
ago by fewer than 500 votes.
   Woo, a 51-year-old physics professor at the University of
Delaware, was elected lieutenant governor in his first bid for
public office. He is the highest ranking Chinese-American in state
government in the United States.
   Beard, a 49-year-old millionaire who inherited his wealth, had
the backing of party loyalists and labor. He has served as chairman
for job creation commissions under the past four presidents.
   The 2,800-vote mistake occurred in a district in New Castle
County where about 280 Democrats are registered. Beard received 28
votes there, but a computer operator recorded the votes as 2,828 at
the county's department of elections, according to the county
elections director.

<HEAD>Dukakis Sounding Hawkish; Bush Boosting Economy as Issue</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Bentsen, Quayle remarks, new ad, inserting 3
grafs after lead; subs 11th graf pvs, Republican vice</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, sounding hawkish in tone, pledged his support
for a variety of weapons systems as he couterattacked against GOP
contentions that he is weak on defense. George Bush declared that
he is the only presidential candidate who can carry American peace
and prosperity into the 1990s.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis' Democratic running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
declared today in Dallas that ``the polls have turned around'' and
that Republicans' ``outrageous charges on patriotism'' had created
a backlash among voters.
   Sen. Dan Quayle, Bush's running mate, said today in Oklahoma
City that ``I will be delighted to compare my qualifications'' to
those of Dukakis, who has been suggesting voters wouldn't be wise
to put the Indiana senator ``a heartbeat away'' from the presidency.
   The Bush campaign began airing in California an anti-Dukakis ad
saying the Massachusetts governor had a chance to clean up Boston
Harbor but chose not to, raising the cost when the job eventually
is done.
   The Democratic nominee, completing three days of foreign policy
and defense speeches, charged Wednesday that the nation's military
has suffered from years of neglect under the Reagan administration.
   Dukakis promised an audience in Annapolis, Md., that the nation
is ``going to have strong strategic forces, we're going to have
strong conventional forces, and we're going to clean up the mess in
the Pentagon.''
   Bush told a raucous rally in San Francisco's Chinatown that the
November election provides the voters with a choice. ``You can
choose to keep going with the policies that have launched the
longest period of economic growth in history or you can choose to
go backward.''
   The vice president was campaigning again today in California, a
key state with the most electoral votes _ 47. He planned another
attack on rival Dukakis in an economic speech to San Francisco's
Commonwealth Club before ending the day in Ohio.
   Dukakis was flying to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming to
view fire damage to 939,270 acres of the 2.2 million-acre facility
and meet with firefighters, local residents and governors of
Western states ravaged by the blaze.
   Dukakis was not expected to take a position on the question of
whether the Reagan administration was wrong to let the fires burn
unchecked until mid-July.
   ``He's not going out there to criticize but to talk and listen
and learn ... He wants to see the fires, listen, and say that if
elected president he'll look at the fire policy,'' Dukakis
communications director Leslie Dach said.
   ``He'll be expressing support for people fighting the fire and
be shown some of the damaged areas,'' said Dukakis spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
   Aides said he would meet with Gov. Ted Schwinden of Montana;
Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado; Gov. Mike Sullivan of Wyoming, and Gov.
Cecil Andrus of Idaho.
   Republican Quayle, stumping for votes in Kansas, held his first
news conference since Sept. 1. Quayle's counterpart, Democrat
Bentsen, was appearing in Dallas and Memphis, Tenn.
   The two contenders got word Wednesday on their only vice
presidential debate, which was set for Oct. 5 in Omaha, Neb.
Bentsen said debating Quayle would give both an opportunity ``to
compare our records of experience and accomplishment in the U.S.
Senate.''
   The two encountered hostile crowds on the campaign trail as the
GOP senator from Indiana was jeered by Dukakis supporters chanting
``Go home Quayle!'' in Albuquerque, N.M., and hecklers rattled the
Democratic senator in his home state of Texas.
   ``As you listen to this babble over here, you can't help but
think of the Dukakis positions,'' Quayle said. ``They have no
positions. They're loud but they don't have any ideas.
   ``I understand you have a balloon festival coming up. The
governor of Massachusetts has a lot of hot air, why don't you
invite him?'' he said.
   Bentsen, who overcame his initial problems to respond to the
jeers in Grand Prairie, Texas, defended his running mate as a
candidate who would strengthen the military with practical weapons
instead of the ``Buck Rogers'' type of GOP program.
   Dukakis, in a speech at Georgetown University, promised his
support for development of the Advanced Tactical Fighter aircraft
and the Sea Wolf attack submarine, if elected.
   ``It's time for an end to Republican smoke and mirrors on
national defense,'' Dukakis said.
   President Reagan, campaigning for Bush in Missouri, made his
first referrence to Dukakis' recent emphasis on defense and foreign
policy, saying, ``We haven't seen such a radical transformation
since Dustin Hoffman played `Tootsie.'''
   Bush, who pitched patriotism to Hispanic workers in Fresno,
Calif., courted Asian voters in San Francisco with the words ``only
one man is pledged to build a better America through low taxes and
high opportunity, and only one man wants laws against crime,
tougher laws, and creative programs for our schools.''
   ``Only one person _ only one person can carry America's peace
and prosperity into the 1990s,'' he said. ``I am here to tell you
that I am that man.''
   The vice president received a blessing from a Buddhist monk
described as ``the great master.''
   Later, however, about 400 demonstrators gathered at Union Square
across from the hotel where Bush delivered a fund-raising speech.
The protesters chanted ``Where's George'' and ``Money for AIDS,
stop the war, U.S. out of El Salvador.'' Police said at least one
person was arrested.
   In the latest nationwide poll, an ABC News-Washington Post
survey of 1,092 likely voters, Dukakis and Bush were essentially
tied, with 48 percent supporting Dukakis for president and 45
percent backing Bush. The poll had a margin of sampling error of
three percentage points.
   The poll was conducted Sept. 7 through Tuesday, finishing two
days after two other polls that had found an eight-point Bush lead.
That indicated some movement to Dukakis in those last two days.

   Twenty-seven freight cars derailed in
a sparsely populated area early today, spilling a corrosive
chemical, and four police officers were taken to the hospital with
respiratory problems, authorities said.
   The 40-car train, which originated in New Orleans, was traveling
about 60 mph when it derailed, said CSX Corp. spokesman Lindsey
Leckie. Twenty-two of the derailed cars were loaded.
   One leaking car contained pulp mill liquor, a byproduct of pulp
mill operations; the other contained potassium hydroxide, a
corrosive chemical used in electroplating and the manufacture of
soap and varnish remover, officials said.
   The four officers were taken to area hospitals for tests.
   ``When we first came on the scene there was a lot of smoke and
all kinds of fumes coming out of there,'' said police Capt. J.C.
Green.
   Police said the cause of the 2 a.m. derailment was not known.
   CSX said propane would be transferred out of another derailed
car later today.
   Green said there were virtually no homes in the area.

   Eastern Airlines Machinists on Thursday began
voting on a contract offer seeking $161 million in wage cuts.
   Eastern is seeking cuts of 10 percent to 20 percent for
mechanics and sharper cuts for the less-skilled workers. A
maintenance worker with three years' seniority, for example, would
be cut from $13.47 an hour to $6.72 an hour. The offer would also
cut vacation time and other benefits.
   The company and its largest union have been in mediation since
January. Eastern wants the mediator to declare an impasse, leading
to a 30-day cooling-off period management said would spur a
settlement. The union believes the company wants a strike.
   The Machinists leadership scheduled the vote on the contract
offer to rebut management claims it doesn't represent rank-and-file
sentiments in negotiations. Management has said the contract vote
is another delaying tactic.
   The Machinists still represent nearly one-third of Eastern
employees, but the union and company estimate its current numbers
at about 9,000, possibly below that, because of layoffs, firings
and attrition. The union had 13,000 members when the Texas Air
Corp. took over two years ago.
   The members put their votes in sealed envelopes and turn them
into their union stewards, who will send them to union
headquarters, general Chairman Roy Anderson said.
   Workers at other company bases began voting Thursday, while
Miami-based union employees will vote Monday. The Machinists' union
office said the votes will be tallied here Sept. 23.

<HEAD>Dissident Says Soviets Should Cut Military Service Time in Half</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union should cut mandatory military
service in half because it is not threatened with attack, leading
dissident Andrei D. Sakharov said in an interview published
Thursday.
   The weekly political magazine New Times quoted the 67-year-old
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and nuclear physicist as saying the
Kremlin should cut service time, now two years, to reduce the size
of the military and use the resources elsewhere.
   ``At present, the Soviet Union is not threatened by any
aggression,'' he said. ``There are no Hitlerites now.''
   In addition to Nazi Germany's aggression under dictator Adolf
Hitler, World War II was brought on by Soviet dictator Josef
Stalin's ``mistakes and crimes'' which frightened the West, he said.
   But he said the Soviet Union _ and the West's attitude toward it
_ have changed.
   ``There is really not a single government which would threaten
the USSR with attack. There isn't! Even with a halving of Soviet
armed forces this is absolutely excluded,'' Sakharov told New Times.
   A reduction of the Soviet armed forces would help improve
conditions for scaling back conventional weapons in Europe and the
entire world, he said. A force reduction also would allow the
Soviet Union to transfer resources and manpower now used for the
military to civilian uses, he said.
   Since the United States and Soviet Union agreed in December to
eliminate their arsenals of medium-range nuclear weapons, many
Western politicians have called on the Soviet Union to cut back
conventional arsenals in which they claim the Kremlin has an
advantage.
   New Times said it interviewed Sakharov while he was in the Black
Sea resort of Dagomys at an international conference of scientists
this month.
   Sakharov, who was virtually blacklisted before Mikhail S.
Gorbachev became the Soviet leader, has been quoted with increasing
frequency in the Soviet press in the past six months.
   Last December, the weekly Moscow News published a letter from
Sakharov proposing that the Kremlin change its position on how to
cut the superpowers' long-range nuclear arsenals.
   The scientist helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb and later
was a founder of the Soviet human rights movement. He was awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975.
   In 1980, he was exiled to the city of Gorky for criticizing the
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. Gorbachev, who has waged a
campaign for openness on selected topics, allowed him to return to
Moscow in December 1986.

   Trucks, equipment and personnel from two dozen
federal agencies are standing ready to respond along the Texas
coast if Hurricane Gilbert comes ashore there, officials said today.
   ``It's fair to say that we recognize that we face the greatest
weather threat we have ever faced in our part of the country. We
want to be certain our preparation is up to the challenge,'' Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, told a briefing at the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, which coordinates disaster assistance.
   Gramm and FEMA official Grant Peterson said the paperwork has
been prepared so that President Reagan can immediately declare a
disaster and set in motion relief efforts.
   ``We are taking the hurricane very, very seriously, as we would
urge all of the citizens in the area'' to do, Peterson said.
   Maj. Gen. J.D. Smith of the Defense Department said the Pentagon
has streamlined its procedures to ensure that ``this is not a
bureaucratic, slow-moving turtle.''
   Peterson said trucks at FEMA's Denton, Texas, regional
headquarters are loaded down with gear such as communications
equipment and electric generators and are prepared to move as soon
as needed.
   He and Gramm said federal agencies will be dispatching
Spanish-speaking personnel and Spanish-language forms and pamphlets
to help communication with the large Hispanic population along the
coast.
   Private groups were also joining in the relief effort.
   The American Red Cross said Wednesday it had begun sending
emergency supplies to four hurricane ``watch'' districts being
established at several Texas cities.
   The Red Cross said thousands of blankets, cots, comfort kits and
cleanup kits were on their way to Corpus Christi, Harlingen,
Houston and Beaumont, Texas. In addition, volunteers and staff
members have been sent to San Antonio, Texas, and Birmingham, Ala.
which have been established as staging areas for deployment after
the storm hits.
   Gramm said Wednesday that an undetermined number of active duty
military personnel and equipment, including trucks, helicopters and
bulldozers, would be sent from Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas, and
possibly Fort Bliss in El Paso, he said.
   Gramm also announced that the Army Corps of Engineers had opened
an emergency office in Galveston to handle flood control and
emergency construction along the coast.
   ``The idea is the better organized we are in advance of the
potential dangers of the hurricane, the less we will have in terms
of property damage and personal injury,'' he said.
   Separately, the Agency for International Development said the
United States was sending $396,000 worth of relief supplies to
Jamaica, including 360 rolls of plastic sheeting, 200 tents, 3,966
water jugs, 18 water tanks, 10 chain saw kits and 9,600 cotton
blankets.
   A portion of the assistance was flown by the military from a
U.S. stockpile in Panama on Wednesday.
   Partners of the Americas, a group of 60 countries including the
United States and nations in Latin America and the Caribbean,
announced it had set up a special relief fund to help the people of
Jamaica and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
   The group is seeking cash donations to purchase ``roofing
materials, plastic sheeting, strong soaps, disinfectants,
mattresses, beds and bed linens,'' said William Reese, president of
the group which was established in 1964 as part of the Alliance for
Progress.
   The group is not in a position to accept clothing or food
donations, Reese said.
   Individuals interested in contributing to either relief effort
can do so through their local Red Cross chapter or send donations
to:
   _The American Red Cross, P.O. Box 37243, Washington, D.C. 20013
and
   _Partners of the Americas, Hurricane Gilbert Relief Fund, 1424 K
St., N.W., Suite 700, Washington, D.C. 20005.

   With the Christmas season approaching federal
officials said Thursday that they are intensifying their efforts to
block the importation of dangerous toys.
   The crackdown is a joint effort of the Consumer Product Safety
Commission and the Customs Service.
   ``We are serving notice to importers and foreign toy
manufacturers that the commission and the Customs Service will not
tolerate violative toys being shipped into U.S. commerce,'' said
Terrence M. Scanlon, chairman of the safety agency.
   So far this year the two agencies have blocked the entry of
478,000 toys with a retail value of $1.37 million, Scanlon reported.
   Most imports enter the country in September through November in
anticipation of the holiday toy-buying season, he said. Thus, the
two agencies are looking closer at imported toys during this
season, with a particular emphasis on toys with small parts that
may present a choking hazard and high lead levels in paint.
   The joint operation is concentrated in major importing ports,
officials said, including Atlanta, Baltimore, New York, Chicago,
Los Angeles, Miami, San Francisco, Seattle, Charleston, S.C. and
Savannah, Ga.

   Opening statements began today in a contract
dispute over publication of a collection of short stories by the
late John Cheever.
   A federal judge in New York last month halted publication of the
book, ``Uncollected Short Stories of John Cheever,'' pending
resolution of the dispute between Cheever's widow, Mary, and the
publisher, Academy Chicago Ltd.
   Academy is asking state court to uphold its 1987 contract with
Mrs. Cheever, who contends the publisher misled her on who would
have control over the book's contents.
   Mrs. Cheever, who lives in Ossining, N.Y., a New York City
suburb, was not on hand for opening statements. Judge Roger Kiley
is presiding in the non-jury trial.
   Mrs. Cheever says the book would have horrified her husband, who
won the 1979 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, because it includes early
work that was not up to his later standards. Cheever died in 1982.
   The book includes 68 stories written between 1930 and 1981.

   House Speaker Jim Wright is urging the
chamber's ethics committee to wrap up its case against him in the
next month, but one member of the panel said today that timetable
might be difficult to meet.
   ``We seem to be raising more questions than answers,'' said Rep.
John T. Myers, R-Ind., a member of the panel, formally known as the
Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. Myers said the
committee has an obligation to be thorough, and said he believed
most members see the probe taking longer than they had hoped.
   The committee met behind closed doors for the second straight
day, this time to review progress in the case with its special
counsel, Chicago attorney Richard J. Phelan. On Wednesday, the
speaker himself spent 5{ hours presenting his defense to the panel.
   ``It was very friendly, very frank, very candid and open,''
Wright, D-Texas, said of his unusual daylong, closed-door session
with the committee. Wright was accompanied by his attorney, William
Oldaker.
   ``I said, `Let's come to a resolution of it.' After all, the
facts are clear. If they discover that I have done something wrong
inadvertently, they should say that.'' But Wright said he did not
anticipate such a result.
   ``Nobody has suggested in this whole day's hearing that I did,''
he said.
   Committee Chairman Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said Wright's
testimony was completed, but he declined to say how far the
investigation had progressed.
   Wright declined to discuss with reporters the details of his
testimony, which was given under oath, but said: ``I answered every
question.''
   In a statement issued by Wright's office, he said he had given
the panel ``a factual clarification of the erroneous, incomplete
and misleading charges which have been made.''
   The committee since June has been investigating charges that
Wright received unduly high royalties on a book he wrote with help
from tax-paid staff and published through a longtime friend in Fort
Worth who had done campaign work for the speaker.
   Other allegations are that Wright improperly intervened with
federal regulators on behalf of Texas businesses and that he used a
Fort Worth condominium owned by a family with whom he had business
ties.
   ``It should be abundantly clear that the charges against me hold
no water whatsoever,'' Wright said. ``I believe that is clear to
the committee.''
   Wright also said the investigation is a reminder that ``members
of Congress do live in glass houses. ... We should be prepared to
conduct our affairs with such rectitude that people can't find
anything wrong.''
   But he said he fully expected that the investigation will be
completed by the time the House adjourns in early October. ``I do
not want it left dangling. I want it resolved,'' he said.
   He pronounced himself ``very, very happy'' to finally be called
to testify. ``I've looked forward to this for more than three
months,'' he said.
   The ethics committee has subpoenaed numerous witnesses in
connection with the complaints filed against Wright by his chief
accuser, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and already has interviewed
many of them. Wednesday's session was Wright's first appearance
before the panel.
   Wright brought with him several dozen books, which he called
``part of the documentation.'' One group of books was volumes he
said were published under 50 percent royalty agreements by
small-scale publishers. An additional 50 books on a cart wheeled
into the hearing room were by members of Congress and contained
acknowledgements of help from tax-paid staff members, the speaker
said.
   Among books on Wright's list prepared with staff help was a 1986
volume, ``Strategic Defense and the Western Alliance,'' by Sen. Dan
Quayle, the GOP vice presidential nominee. ``Man of the House,'' a
1987 book by former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., was
written with help from 32 staff members, according to the list.
   One allegation against Wright is that he made unduly high
royalties on his book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' which was
prepared in part by workers on his congressional office payroll.
Expenses of one aide, Matthew Cossolotto, to fly to Fort Worth to
complete the book were paid from Wright's congressional office
expense account.
   Wright made more than $55,000 in royalties on the book, which
was published in 1984 by a Wright friend in Fort Worth who also had
handled hundreds of thousands of dollars of campaign work for the
speaker. Wright's royalty was 55 percent of each copy's $5.95
selling price.
   The speaker said he took the books to show the ethics committee
that what he had done was ``a very ... customary thing.''

   The U.S. industrial operating rate rose for
the fifth consecutive month in August, but economists played down
the inflationary effect of the increase because it was entirely
attributable to a temporary summer surge at utilities.
   The Federal Reserve Board said Thursday that the nation's
factories, mines and utilities operated at 83.7 percent of capacity
last month, a 0.1 percentage point increase over July, when the
rate had risen a sharp 0.6 percent.
   It was the fifth consecutive increase and the highest rate in
more than eight years. Industry last operated at 83.7 percent of
capacity in March 1980.
   Economists believe an overall operating rate approaching 85
percent signals higher prices as industry strains to meet demand.
   The operating rate at utilities jumped by 1.7 percentage points
in August to 82.4 percent. The rate at plants churning out
electricity to meet the demand of air conditioners during the
summer heat wave soared 1.9 percentage points to 86.9 percent, the
highest since 1979.
   However, analysts expect the strain on utilities to ease as the
weather cools and they pointed to a slight decline in the operating
rate in the closely-watched manufacturing sector _ the first since
February _ as the more significant number in Thursday's report.
   Overall, the manufacturing rate eased from 83.9 percent in July
to 83.8 percent in August.
   The rate at factories making durable goods, ``big ticket'' items
expected to last three or more years, held steady at 82.3 percent
in August, while the rate at factories producing non-durable goods
fell from 86.1 percent in July to 85.9 percent.
   ``I think industrial capacity has peaked. That's the highest
it's going to get for awhile,'' said Michael K. Evans, a private
economist in Washington. ``That's good news for inflation
fighters.''
   Evans said the export boom of the past year, which has pushed
manufacturing operating rates up by 2.3 percentage points since
August 1987, is starting to wane.
   ``Exports are still growing, but at a more normal pace,'' he
said.
   Durable goods manufacturing held steady despite a 0.5 percentage
point jump in operating rates at steel and other metal
manufacturing plants. The August level, 91 percent, was 8
percentage points higher than a year ago.
   However, rates at auto plants fell to 70.4 percent last month,
down from 71.4 percent in July and a peak this year of 75.3 percent
in June.
   The rate for the mining sector, which includes oil and gas
drilling, fell from 83.0 percent in July to 82.9 percent.

   Republican George Bush today ripped into
Michael Dukakis' economic record as governor and said the
Democrat's pledge to do for the nation what he did for
Massachusetts sounds ``like a threat.''
   Bush told a packed ballroom breakfast at the Commonwealth Club
that Dukakis has presided over an era when Massachusetts ``taxing
and spending has increased more than in any other state.''
   ``My opponent still says he wants to `do for the nation what he
has done for Massachusetts.' That slogan is beginning to sound more
and more like a threat,'' he said.
   Bush challenged Dukakis to state whether he would repeal the
Reagan administration's 1981 tax cuts.
   `If he thinks they were such a bad idea, does he plan to repeal
the 25 percent tax cuts which I supported for the American people?
I think the American people have a right to know,'' Bush said.
   Bush ridiculed the Dukakis claim of an economic Massachusetts
miracle, saying the state ``has turned a surplus into a growing
budget deficit.''
   ``If this were the Olympics, his composite score would make him
the gold medal winner in the tax-and-spend competition,'' Bush said.
   On Wednesday night, Bush told a $1,000-a-person fund-raiser that
he he is the candidate capable of bringing the nation's current
peace and prosperity into the next decade.
   ``It is legitimate to ask what is the end purpose of economic
growth. Is it just to be rich? What a shallow ambition. Is there
really any satisfaction to be had in being the fattest country?''
   He said prosperity would bring ``greater strides in the arts and
sciences and things of the spirit but it also means just giving a
helping hand to a fellow citizen who needs it.''
   In unusually poetic comments, Bush sought to elaborate on his
vow to make America ``a kinder, gentler nation,'' a phrase he used
in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention last
month.
   He told the gathering he is ``almost haunted by the lives being
lead by the children of our inner cities.'' But he said government
can't solve their problems and that he hoped as president he could
be ``a gentle persuader to rally our people to help our children.''
   A newly published poll completed Sept. 12 showed that Bush had
overcome a deficit of 16 percentage points in late July and was
running neck-and-neck with Dukakis in California.
   According to the California Poll released Thursday, Dukakis'
lead of 52 percent to 36 percent over Bush six weeks ago had shrunk
to 46 percent to 45 percent, which is a tie within the poll's 4
percent margin of error. Poll director Mervin Field called it ``a
phenomenal reversal'' but cautioned that ``people can easily change
their minds.''
   As he spoke at the fund-raiser held at the luxury St. Francis
hotel, about 400 demonstrators gathered across the street in Union
Square. Some pushed over police barricades, spilling out into the
street, stopping automobile traffic and the city's famed cable cars.
   The protesters chanted ``Where's George'' and ``Money for AIDS,
stop the war, U.S. out of El Salvador.'' Police said at least one
person was arrested.
   At a colorful rally in Chinatown earlier in the evening, Bush
said voters must decide whether ``to keep going with the policies
that have launched the longest period of economic growth in history
or you can choose to go backward.''
   ``Only one man is pledged to build a better America through low
taxes and high opportunity, and only one man wants laws against
crime, tougher laws, and creative programs for our schools,'' Bush
told the raucous crowd. ``Only one person _ only one person can
carry America's peace and prosperity into the 1990s.
   ``I am here to tell you that I am that man,'' Bush said.
   The vice president received a blessing from a Buddhist monk
described as ``the Great Master,'' and watched as young men dressed
in costumes of yellow and red dancing dragons made their way
through the city streets.
   Bush supporters outnumbered the noisy hecklers, who chanted
``down with Bush,'' and carried signs opposing offshore oil
drilling. Some Democrats in the crowd distributed fortune cookies
with messages reading, ``Vote Dukakis,'' and ``Where was George?''
_ a refrain from the Democratic National Convention.
   California, with the largest number of electoral votes _ 47 _ is
a key battleground, and Bush is spending two and a half days
campaigning in the state.
   Earlier, at a rally in Fresno at Sun-Maid Growers, a cooperative
of 1,500 raisin growers in the San Joaquin Valley, Bush accused
Dukakis of using the phrase ``economic patriotism'' as ``a code
word for protectionism.''
   ``We will not have it,'' he told the rally of several hundred
people.

   Thousands from southern Texas to
Louisiana's bayous shuttered homes and shops, packed up livestock
and fled to higher ground today as Hurricane Gilbert roared across
the Gulf of Mexico toward the U.S. coast.
   ``This is a killer storm,'' said Gordon Guthrie, director of the
Florida Division of Emergency of Management. ``I feel sorry for
anybody wherever this hits.''
   Grocery stores ran low on bottled water, batteries, canned tuna
and bread as residents laid in supplies. Homeowners covered windows
and doors with plywood and shatter-proofing hurricane tape.
Offshore oil workers headed inland.
   Classes were canceled or cut short today in some communities.
Southwestern Bell Co., bracing for downed phone lines, loaned
cellular phones to Corpus Christi and other cities. Authorities set
up shelters and stockpiled sandbags.
   The military began flying aircraft inland from coastal bases in
Mississippi and Texas to wait out the storm at Midland
International Airport.
   ``It sounds facetious, but people can stay as long as we can
fingerprint them so we can identify them later,'' said Bob
Pinkerton Jr., mayor in the coastal resort of South Padre Island,
where 1,000 residents were told to evacuate.
   Early today, Gilbert appeared headed for Texas, possibly hitting
land by Friday afternoon. The National Weather Service issued a
hurricane warning this morning for the southern half of the
370-mile Texas coast from Brownsville to Port O'Connor, a stretch
that includes Corpus Christi. Mexico's northern coast also had a
hurricane warning.
   At noon EDT, the storm cneter was about 410 miles southeast of
Brownsville, moving west-northwest at about 15 mph, the weather
service said.
   A hurricane watch remained in effect for the remainder of the
Texas coast, from Port O'Connor north to Port Arthur.
   ``The highest probabilities that we have are in the Brownsville,
Texas, area as far as the center is concerned,'' Robert Sheets,
director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami, said on CBS's
``This Morning.'' ``If it takes the north turn, it could actually
rake a good portion of the Texas coast.''
   ``Those major destructive winds are going to be in there fairly
tight close to the center. But the impacts are going to be felt
over most of the Texas area.''
   The giant hurricane, considered one of the strongest ever, was
blamed for dozens of deaths in the Caribbean and left 500,000
Jamaicans homeless before it struck Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on
Wednesday, forcing thousands to evacuate.
   It weakened somewhat as it passed over the peninsula, falling
from a Category 5 _ the strongest rank _ to a Category 3 as top
sustained winds eased to 120 mph from 175 mph. But forecasters said
they expected it to go back up to a Category 4 now that it was back
over the gulf, with winds of at least 130 mph.
   The 1,600 students and about 200 patients at the University of
Texas Medical Branch on Galveston Island were being evacuated, said
spokeswoman Leann Teymour.
   In Louisiana, 10,000 people had orders today to leave homes
along the bayous on the state's flood-prone coastline. Grand Isle,
a barrier island resort where 2,100 people live, was evacuated
Wednesday, as were many of Plaquemines Parish's 15,000 residents.
   ``I'm scared to death,'' said Pam Quigley, who recalled the
devastation by Hurricane Celia in 1970. ``If you could have seen
Corpus Christi after Celia, you wouldn't have believed it. It was
just demolished.''
   NASA delayed announcement of a launch date for space shuttle
Discovery because the hurricane could disrupt operations at the
control center in Houston.
   Texas Gov. Bill Clements issued an emergency proclamation
allowing local authorities to suspend laws ``to preserve the
health, safety and welfare of the public,'' including such things
as the direction of highways.
   On the Bolivar Peninsula outside Galveston Bay, most beachgoers
and about 3,000 residents left by sundown Wednesday, packing the
Bolivar Ferry to Galveston all day long, said Police Chief Farris
Collier of Crystal Beach.
   ``Some of them are being stubborn and are saying they're staying
no matter what,'' he said. ``But if it hits here, they won't be
here any more.''
   ``If I wasn't the city manager, I'd evacuate myself, but I'm
required to stay,'' Galveston's Doug Matthews said today on ABC's
``Good Morning America.'' ``We've never seen anything like this
type of hurricane in the gulf. ... It's going to kill.''
   Galveston Mayor Jan Coggeshall said on CBS that her greatest
fear was that people would decide to stay and wait out the storm.
   Two Galveston residents were arrested for trying to sell plywood
for windows and doorways at an inflated price just hours after the
City Council passed an emergency ordinance designed to stem price
gouging by merchants.
   Hurricane frenzy also was apparent in Cameron Parish, La., a
thin layer of lush marsh just above sea level that has been a
frequent front door for hurricanes over the years.
   The parish of 10,000 residents boasts about 5,000 head of cattle.
   ``We'll be working all night to get them out,'' Francis Bride, a
Lake Charles physician, said as he helped shove the rumps of balky
steers into a packed trailer.
   The impact of the 450-mile-wide storm was felt even in areas not
expected to be hit by Gilbert.
   State emergency officials in Montgomery, Ala., began making
preparations to receive thousands of people who could take refuge
there from the storm.
   ``We did a survey of hotels from Montgomery to Mobile and found
that people from Mississippi and Louisiana were making hotel
reservations in large, large numbers,'' said J. Danny Cooper,
director of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.
   Florida's Gov. Bob Martinez canceled a trade mission to France
because of the storm.
   ``Once it gets in the gulf there's only one way out _ to have a
landfall,'' said Martinez. ``It's that kind of storm where you
don't sit around and have a hurricane party.''
   In Texas, Clements late Wednesday suspended elections planned
for Harris and Brazoria counties.
   In Corpus Christi, where Hurricane Allen killed two people in
1980, all five school districts called off class for today and
Friday, even though it wasn't known where or when Gilbert would
strike.
   ``We decided to close the schools in order to allow people who
want to evacuate the area time to do so,'' said Charles Benson,

   An escaping East German man was
shot and critically wounded Thursday after he reached West German
territory by swimming the Elbe River, police said.
   It was not immediately known who fired the shot, which wounded
the man in the chest as he reached the riverbank.
   Although communist East German border troops have fired on
people fleeing to the West, there have been no recent shooting
incidents along the heavily fortified border.
   Police said the man escaped near the town of Alt Garge, about 30
miles southeast of Hamburg, where the Elbe river forms the border
between the two German states.
   West German border police in Hanover said in a statement that
the 19-year-old man was already on West German territory when he
felt something hit his chest.
   Residents living near the scene told police they heard two shots
fired at about 8:15 a.m. They took the injured man to a nearby
hospital where he was listed in critical condition.
   The man's name and other details were not released in accordance
with West German practice.
   Police said the prosecutor's office in the nearby district
capital of Lueneburg began an investigation.
   More than 300 East Germans have escaped across
communist-constructed border fortifications into West Germany or
West Berlin this year.

<HEAD>Wrongful Termination Lawsuits Increasing, Think Tank Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees are more likely to sue now
when they've been fired than they were at the start of the decade,
according to a study released Thursday.
   The average employee's initial demand was slightly less than the
average payment after trial, and businesses, considering legal
expenses only, would be better off paying initial demands rather
than going to trial, the study said.
   The study was conducted by James N. Dertouzos, Elaine Holland
and Patricia Ebener of the Rand Corp.'s Institute for Civil
Justice. Rand is a non-profit, private think-tank that analyzes
national security and public welfare issues.
   The researchers reviewed nationwide case law and trial patterns
through January 1987, sampled Los Angeles Superior Court filings
since 1980 and analyzed California trials from 1980 to 1986.
   Trials were 2{ times more likely in California, Indiana,
Massachusetts, Montana and North Dakota, which Rand described as
the five states with the most liberal interpretations of the law.
   The study found that in Los Angeles Superior Court alone,
wrongful termination lawsuits grew from 90 in 1980 to 600 in 1986.
   The researchers found in the California cases that initial jury
awards averaged $650,000 but that figure was inflated by a few
multimillion-dollar judgments. The median award was $177,000.
However, post-trial reductions in jury awards to successful
plaintiffs averaged 45 percent.
   The typical California plaintiff was: 45 years old, eight years
of seniority and yearly earnings of $36,000. More than 89 percent
of plaintiffs were white, and nearly 69 percent were men. Middle
managers accounted for 39.8 percent of filings compared to 13.6
percent by executives.
   In 80.6 percent of firings the employers claimed inadequate
performance. External economic factors were cited in the other
discharges.
   Jury awards rose with the plaintiff's age, peaking at age 50.
Women's awards appeared to be ``considerably lower'' than men's,
the study found.
   Dertouzos concluded: ``Unless you have a very good case, don't
bother. Very few people are getting big payments. If you deserve to
be fired, the likelihood of getting big money is very small.''
   Attorneys collected 40 percent of plaintiffs' winnings, the
study found, and in California that meant the average lawyer's
share was $81,000. Lawyers for both sides collectively pocketed 60
percent of the money changing hands in wrongful discharge cases,
the study said.

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of demonstrators crowded
the streets of the capital Thursday to demand democracy. Sources
said the U.S. Embassy refused student leaders' requests for weapons
but offered moral support.
   Hundreds of soldiers joined the protesters, who included
homeless and handicapped people and demonstrators on hunger strikes.
   Police shot at looters and killed two people, official Radio
Rangoon said. Food is in diminishing supply as trasportation
strikes restrict deliveries to the capital.
   The almost daily protests have been peaceful since hard-line
President Sein Lwin resigned Aug. 12 and security forces returned
to their barracks. But in recent days, protesters have become more
aggressive, shouting death threats at officials of President Maung
Maung's government.
   ``(Government officials) run or we will kill you!'' some
protesters shouted on Wednesday when more than 100,000 people took
to the streets.
   The government said it would end one-party rule and hold the
first multiparty elections since 1960, possibly as soon as late
October. The opposition rejected the proposal, saying it needed
time to organize and raise funds and did not trust the government
to run fair elections.
   Among the protesters Thursday was a one-legged man with a crutch
who led about 50 other ill-clad men carrying a banner that read:
``Pavement Dwellers, Suicide Squad.''
   ``We are prepared to die for democracy. We have nothing to
lose,'' he told a reporter.
   The students who went to the American Embassy Wednesday said
5,000 protesters were ready to take up arms, said sources who spoke
on conditon of anonymity. An embassy official told the students the
United States could offer them only moral support, said the
sources. The embassy had no comment.
   At least 500 soldiers joined the demonstrators Sept. 9, some
disillusioned with the high standard of living of senior officers
and the army's outdated weapons.
   Rangoon newspapers said Capt. Sai Win Kyaw of the 22nd Light
Infantry Brigade told reporters Wednesday that the government
exploited the army, and he called on all soldiers to resign.
   About 75 people ended a 48-hour hunger strike Thursday morning
outside city hall, and more than 90 others began a 72-hour fast.
More than 1,000 schoolchildren completed a 36-hour hunger strike on
Monday night.
   State-run Radio Rangoon said one person was killed late
Wednesday when guards fired on about 150 people looting a rice
warehouse in the city's port area. Another person was killed early
Thursday when he joined a group trying to break into a medical
school in Rangoon.
   Guards have killed several other people in recent weeks as food
and other supplies continue to dwindle and looting has increased.
   Burma's last multiparty elections, on Feb. 6, 1960, swept former
Prime Minister U Nu to power.
   U Nu was toppled in the 1962 coup led by Ne Win, who outlawed
all political parties except his Burma Socialist Program Party and
pursued policies that made resource-rich Burma one of the world's
poorest nations.
   Massive protests began after Ne Win resigned July 23 and the
party named hardliner Sein Lwin his successor. Sein Lwin resigned
17 days later after rioting killed at least 112 people in Rangoon.
On Aug. 19, Maung Maung became Burma's first civilian leader since
U Nu.

   Former Sen. Eugene McCarthy, D-Minn., a

be abolished because the office ``clutters up the campaign.''
   MCarthy, speaking at the University of Maine at Farmington on
Wednesday, said the vice presidency puts people in line for the
presidency who don't belong there, such as Dan Quayle, Richard M.
Nixon and Spiro Agnew.
   McCarthy accused Quayle, the current Republican vice
presidential candidate, of ``double hypocrisy'' for serving in the
National Guard during the Vietnam War. He said Quayle was a
``militarist hiding out in the military.''

   A minister who helped arrange two

with masterminding a scheme to take out $125,000 in fraudulent
student loans.
   The Rev. James Stern of Tabernacle of Faith Baptist Church in
Los Angeles was charged Wednesday with grand theft, forgery and
conspiracy.
   Stern recruited 17 people, promising them $3,000 each in return
for applying for $6,000 government-insured loans for tuition at the
University of Sound Art in Hollywood, which trains video and audio
technicians, prosecutors said.
   Seven people were charged with taking out the loans and turning
the money over to Stern, District Attorney's spokesman Andy
Reynolds said Wednesday.
   Stern, 24, helped arranged two much-publicized meetings this
summer of gang members.

   The government says it has confiscated
more than 13,000 acres of ranch land belonging to a drug smuggler
in the biggest such seizure in U.S. history.
   The land seized Wednesday was valued at $35 million and was
owned by Frank Brady, whom investigators have linked to the
Medellin cartel of Colombia responsible for 80 percent of the
cocaine brought into the United States.
   ``All the properties seized today were utilized in drug
trafficking,'' said U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen. He said the
seizure is the country's biggest.
   U.S. marshals seized three central Florida tracts of more than
4,300 acres each.
   One tract has an airstrip with radio-controlled lights to
acccommodate landings at night or in bad weather.
   Brady was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1986 for smuggling
3,000 pounds of marijuana through his private resort in the Bahamas
and property in Astatula, near Orlando.
   He was once one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted but became an
informant who helped convict 11 people of smuggling drugs through
his ranch here.
   Brady earlier forfeited at least $5.6 million in cash and
property.

   Unhealthy air is blanketing many of the world's
cities, subjecting many of the world's 1.8 billion urban dwellers
to respiratory ailments and other health hazards, according to a
U.N. study released Thursday.
   The study, billed as the first comprehensive global assessment
of air pollution, said many countries have made progress in
reducing air pollution but that the situation is still very
serious, especially in Third World nations.
   The 100-page survey, prepared by the World Health Organization
and the U.N. Environment Program, is based on data from up to 15
years of monitoring in more than 60 countries.
   Dr. Michael Gwynne, director of the environment program's Global
Monitoring System, said the survey represents the ``most
comprehensive, detailed and informative study ever carried out.''
   The study focuses on two main pollutants _ sulfur dioxide and
suspended particulate matter. Emissions of sulfur dioxide are
estimated at up to 180 million tons per year, and emissions of
smoke and dust are estimated at more than 100 million tons a year.
   Continuous exposure, especially among children, can result in
acute or chronic respiratory problems.
   Dr. Gwynne said 625 million people, mostly in developing
countries, are exposed to ``unacceptable levels of sulfur dioxide''
and that 550 million more live just within the range of tolerable
levels set by the World Health Organization.
   He said dust and smoke are worse and estimated that about 1.25
billion city dwellers live in ``unacceptable conditions'' and 200
million more live in conditions that are ``only marginal.''
   Data from 54 cities suggest that the average annual sulfur
dioxide level during the 1980-84 monitoring period was highest in
Milan, Italy.
   But Seoul, Rio de Janeiro and Paris were also among the cities
where the average range was above WHO guidelines. Melbourne,
Australia, Tel Aviv, Israel, Toronto, Chicago and Munich were among
those with the lowest averages.
   A separate 33-city survey said sulfur dioxide concentrations
were declining in 21 cities, all in the industrialized West, while
the upward trend was strongest in New Delhi, India. In Poland, it
soared by 80 percent within a decade.
   Emissions in the Soviet Union were not included in the listing,
but the study cited an estimate of 28 million tons in 1979, well
above the United States' estimated total of 23 million tons.
   Suspended particle emissions also decreased in Western
countries, while going up spectacularly in Poland.
   In 18 out of 41 cities, the annual suspended particle emissions
average was above the WHO limit. Kuwait topped the list, which also
included New Delhi, Beijing, Jakarta, Indonesia and Manila,
Philippines. Chicago was the only Western city above the WHO limit.
   The study said nitrogen oxides, produced mainly by automobiles,
are rising in several of the larger European cities, including
London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, West Germany. It noted that most
European countries do not have the stringent standards for
automobile emissions that the United States and Japan have
implemented.
   The issue of nitrogen oxides is also of concern because of their
role in the formation of other oxidants, including ozone. The study
said there are ``worrying indications'' that ozone levels are on
the rise in ``many European and North American cities.''
   The study is less detailed on emissions of carbon monoxide,
which are believed to exceed the combined emissions of all other
major air pollutants.
   Again, most Western countries reported reduced carbon monoxide
emissions, while they were up in Poland and Hungary. Increased use
of unleaded gasoline contributed to an even sharper reduction in
estimated lead emissions in Western countries, with the United
States total down from 147,000 tons a year in 1973-75 to 21,100
tons a decade later.
   In developing countries, automobile emissions of carbon monoxide
and lead are increasingly major issues of concern, the report says.
   ``Careful urban planning is needed to ... minimize the buildup
of these pollutants,'' it says.

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's top health
official said Thursday he will not take a position on a proposed
White House ban on using intentionally aborted fetal tissue for
medical treatment until a National Institutes of Health advisory
committee has completed its review of the issue.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen told reporters
that _ while he remains personally opposed to abortion _ ``there
are some good pros and some good cons'' about using aborted fetal
tissue for experimental treatment for Parkinson's and other
diseases.
   He said ``a task force of the best minds going'' was studing the
issue at a three-day NIH meeting and that he had no intention of
taking a position until the review is completed, probably not for
several weeks.
   Bowen said he could not predict whether the issue will be
resolved during the last few months of the Reagan administration
even though a White House official, Gary Bauer, is pushing for
quick implementation of an outright ban.
   ``Inasmuch as abortions are legal, being unable to utilize the
tissue ... would result in the waste of a resource that is
livesaving and curing for several diseases,'' Bowen told reporters
at a breakfast meeting. He spoke at about the same time the NIH
panel he referred to was opening a second day of hearings to focus
on moral and ethical issues.
   Bowen said it was his judgment that ``we can't in a good common
sense way come up with an answer until we hear'' from the advisory
panel.
   ``If I had Parkinson's I think I would want some of those
(transplanted) cells,'' said Bowen, emphasizing that such a
personal observation does not eliminate the broader ethical
questions.
   He made clear he did not feel rushed to recommend an
administration position even though a Bauer memo disclosed in news
accounts last week instructed Bowen to make his comments by last
Friday.
   ``We have not responded,'' Bowen said. ``I do not know whether
it was a direct order from the president and I don't know that I
will know unless someone tells me.''
   Procedurally, the special NIH committee will make its
recommendations to a standing NIH advisory committee Dec. 1 and
that panel in turn will make a recommendation to NIH Director James
B. Wyngaarden. The NIH director reports to Bowen through Dr. Robert
E. Windom who ordered a temporary ban on federally financed fetal
tissue research pending consideration of moral and ethical issues.
   Father Don McCarthy, a Roman Catholic church leader from
Cincinnati, told the NIH committee the issue draws a clear
distinction between induced abortions and natural abortions.
   ``One might say that the American public becomes accomplices
after the fact for these induced abortions'' if its institutions
embrace policies that could tend to assign a medical value to
having an abortion, he said.
   Several witnesses and committee members used the term ``custom
pregnancy'' as short hand for the concern that a woman might become
pregnant just to produce a fetus for abortion and subsequent
research use _ either for financial reward or in hopes of helping a
sick relative.
   ``I don't think people are as callous about abortion as that
premise suggests,'' said Thomas H. Murray, director of the Center
for Biomedical Ethics at the Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland. ``If we get to that point, I'm deeply worried.''
   Murray said he was convinced that guidelines could be drawn to
insure that a woman's decision to have an abortion would be kept
totally separate from the decision to allow the remains to be used
for research.
   Robert J. Levine of the Yale University School of Medicine told
the committee his institution has drawn its own guidelines that
would exclude transplanting the tissue of an fetus into a relative
of the mother.
   He said that was done out of safety considerations _ that
whatever caused the disease in the relative might somehow be
present in the offspring's genes _ but coincidentally also serves
to negate concern about ``custom pregnancies.''
   Ezra C. Davidson Jr., head of the obstetrics and gynecology
department at King-Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles, said he was
distressed that some committee members seemed to underestimate
``the intensity of the drive for (many) women to have abortions to
resolve a very complex set of problems'' without any encouragement
from researchers or others.
   ``I just wish I had the capacity to translate the reality of
that to the people in this room,'' he said.

   For those who have ever stuffed something
down a suggestion box and thought it might as well have been a rat
hole, take heart.
   Or take Edward A. Anderson, for example.
   Anderson, 51, of Yorba Linda, Calif., has been named ``Suggester
of the Year'' for submitting nine little gems that were adopted by
his company and resulted in cost-savings improvements totaling $22
million in 1987.
   The suggestions were not only lucrative to Anderson's employer,
Hughes Aircraft Co., but they put extra money into his pockets as
well. And patents have been awarded on five of Anderson's ideas
improving on methods of assembling communications satellites.
   The company program does not provide for direct financial
rewards, but ``there's a direct relationship between your
suggestions and your salary raises,'' says Anderson.
   ``I'm motivated by a desire for recognition by the management.
When you come up with a really good idea, you know you did
something important. It's my way of keeping on top of the Christmas
tree.''
   One of his suggestions saved about 15,000 hours of labor.
Another lightened the weight of satellites, cutting down on launch
costs.
   Anderson, a senior scientist in the materials and process
laboratory of Hughes' Space and Communications Group, is a
compulsive suggester.
   In 14 years, he submitted 200 ideas. Of these, his bosses say,
100 were adopted, providing cost savings totaling $75 million.
   Anderson's selection was announced in Orlando at the annual
conference of the National Association of Suggestion Systems, which
includes administrators of suggestion systems for 900 member
companies with a combined total of 13 million employees throughout
the country.
   Runner-up to Anderson was Richard Makaiwi, who recommended the
use of a penuematic underground piercing tool for installation of
natural gas services to customers of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. of
San Jose, Calif.
   The suggestion will provide an estimated savings of more than $1
million in each of the next five years and enriched Makaiwi's bank
account by $25,000.
   Finishing third in the annual competition was Rickey D. Tison,
who works for the Air Force at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma
City. His idea led to the development of a machine part used in the
repair of the engine afterburner of an F-111 jet fighter. The
suggestion also earned Tison $25,000.
   NASS officials said the Air Force suggestion program saved a
record $309 million in fiscal 1987.
   Member companies reported savings of more than $2 billion in
1987 as a result of their employees' suggestion programs, NASS
said. Employees received a total of $150 million in award payments
for suggestions adopted.
   The oldest employee suggestion program in this country was set
up in 1898 by the Eastman Kodak Co. and is still in operation.
Shortly after that, General Electric, Westinghouse, Metropolitan
Life Insurance, Parke Davis Pharmaceuticals and others set up
systems.
   After World War II, a federal law allowed widespread
establishment of such programs in federal, state and local
government agencies.
   And, to emphasize that somebody actually reads, and counts, all
the tips, ideas and comments, NASS member companies reported that
they received 1,023,421 suggestions last year _ 13 suggestions from
every 100 eligible employees.
   Of these, 247,920 were adopted.

   It was an impromptu cattle roundup, pitting
stubborn steers against cattlemen eager to get their most valuable
assets out of town, away from Hurricane Gilbert's fury.
   As Gilbert crossed into the Gulf of Mexico, the cattle drive
began in earnest. The caravan jammed two-lane Louisiana 27, the
major highway leading out of coastal Cameron Parish, with trucks
ranging from pickups carrying two animals to 18-wheelers hauling
double-deck trailers with 50 head.
   Even Francis Bride, a Lake Charles physician, got into the act
Wednesday, helping to shove the rump of a balky steer into the rear
of an already crowded trailer.
   But that's how important cattle are in the parish, a thin layer
of lush marsh just above sea level in western Louisiana that has
been a frequent front door for hurricanes over theyears. The parish
boasts about 5,000 head of cattle, many of them registered
pure-breds.
   ``We've learned and now we move the registered stuff as the
hurricane season starts each year, and don't bring them back until
the season ends,'' said Jamey Guthrie, a cattleman also helping
Bride and others.
   It was a 1957 hurricane, Audrey, that taught the parish that
valuable lesson. Audrey left over 400 people dead and wiped out the
region's cattle industry.
   Bride, who also owns cattle in Cameron, said most of the stock
being moved at the last minute was ``commercial stuff.''
   ``We'll be working all night to get them out,'' he said.

   Mary Lee Fairbanks, second wife of actor
Douglas Fairbanks Jr., has died of cancer. She was 75.
   Mrs. Fairbanks married the actor a few months after meeting him
at a New Year's Eve party in 1939.
   ``She was a girl absolutely full of enthusiasm, excitement and
laughter,'' said Herb Swope, who had invited her to the party.
``She had a humorous view of life. She was always in good humor.''
   Fairbanks, 78, was married twice, first to Joan Crawford,
1929-1934, and then to Mary Lee in 1939.
   The marriage was also Mrs. Fairbank's second _ her first was to
A&P supermarket heir Huntington Hartford.
   Aside from her work with Hospice in Palm Beach County, Mrs.
Fairbanks lived quietly at her home here. She died Wednesday at
Good Samaritan Hospital in neighboring West Palm Beach.
   Besides her husband, survivors include daughters Daphne
Fairbanks, Victoria Fairbanks and Melissa Morant; and eight
grandchildren.
   Funeral services were scheduled Saturday.

<HEAD>Bank Hostages Freed In Britain, Robbers Escape</HEAD>

   Armed robbers abducted a bank manager
and his family, locked more than 60 people in the bank's vaults and
escaped with hundreds of thousands of dollars Thursday, police said.
   Police marksmen, unaware the robbers had fled, burst into the
National Westminster Bank in this northwestern town at noon and
freed the unharmed employees, said Chief Inspector Bill Caine of
the Lancashire Constabulary.
   Police launched a national search for the four robbers.
   Twenty police marksmen ringed the four-story bank building in
the town's center for more than two hours, backed up by 100 other
officers and a fleet of 12 ambulances. Businesses in the area were
ordered closed and evacuated.
   ``We believed the gang was armed and (we) surrounded the
building with armed officers,'' Caine said. ``No shots were fired
at any time during the incident.''
   Detective Superintendent Barrie Walmsley told a news conference
that bank manager Roger Ball, 43, his wife, Jean, and their
13-year-old daughter Vanessa were abducted and held hostage for
more than 16 hours.
   Walmsley said the ordeal began at 6 p.m. Wednesday when Ball
left the bank. He was grabbed by two masked men, blindfolded, bound
and gagged and thrown into the back of a van.
   Ball was driven to his home where four men held him, his wife,
and daughter until 4 a.m. Thursday. The three were then bound,
gagged and hooded, put in the trunks of two vehicles and driven to
the town center, where they were held in an empty store near the
bank, Walmsley said.
   Shortly after 9 a.m., Ball was told to enter the bank, inform
the 60 employees that a robbery would soon took place, and order
them to gather in underground vaults, Walmsley said.
   Ball told them his family was being threatened, and the
employees complied, police said. Gang members armed with sawed-off
shotguns and hand guns held the employees ``at threat,'' while
others stole the money, police said.
   Caine said police learned of the robbery when Mrs. Ball managed
to smash a window in the store where she and her daughter were
being held and alert passersby at about 9:45 a.m. He said customers
and security staff also contacted police when the bank did not open
as scheduled at 10 a.m.
   Caine said police marksmen entered the building, believing the
robbers were still inside, about 12:30 after obtaining a duplicate
set of keys from the bank's head office.

<HEAD>House to Vote on Waiting Period for Handgun Purchases</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Vote on gun amendment estimated around 4:30 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After intense lobbying by forces favoring and
opposing gun control, the House was ready to decide Thursday
whether a major anti-drug initiative should include a seven-day
waiting period for handgun purchases.
   Gun-owner and pro-regulation groups have fought their latest
all-out battle over the waiting period, with both sides bringing
rank-and-file police officers to lobby House members.
   The waiting period is already included in the comprehensive bill
that would add some $2 billion to the nation's $3.9 billion drug
fighting effort.
   The week-long delay would permit police where the purchaser
lives to conduct a background check, but would not require one.
   President Reagan has publicly supported a handgun waiting
period, but has not specifically endorsed the drug bill provisions
of the ``Brady Amendment.'' The measure was symbolically named
after presidential press secretary James Brady, who was shot along
with Reagan in the March 30, 1981, assassination attempt against
the president.
   Brady's wife, Sarah, has become a leading gun control
spokeswoman on behalf of Handgun Control Inc. The powerful National
Rifle Association is her main opposition.
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., has authored an amendment to
eliminate the waiting period.
   His amendment would order the Justice Department to develop _
within 180 days _ a system that would allow gun dealers to check
whether the applicant is a convicted felon.
   McCollum has said the system, which would be submitted to
Congress, could include a telephone check such as the one that
stores use to verify that credit cards are valid.
   The waiting period would require a gun dealer, within a day of a
purchaser's application, to send a sworn application from the
purchaser to the chief law enforcement officer where the buyer
lives.
   The application would include a description of the pistol; its
serial number; the name, address and birth date of the purchaser
taken from a photo identification; and a statement that federal law
does not prohibit the receipt of the gun by the buyer.
   The purchaser could pick up the weapon if nothing is heard from
his hometown police agency within seven days or the police issue a
certificate that the buyer requires the gun due to a threat on his
or her life.
   If a dealer receives a police report after the seven days
stating that the transfer would violate the law, the dealer must
notify police in his own area, and give police in the buyer's home
area all information about the transaction.
   The police agency that permitted the transaction must destroy
the records within 60 days after the date on the applicant's
statement, unless the purchase involved a violation of law.
   Violating the requirements could bring a maximum $1,000 fine and
a one-year prison term.
   States that already have at least a seven day waiting period and
a mandatory background check could enforce their laws instead of
the federal provisions. In all other cases, the federal language
would prevail.
   The bill would leave unchanged the categories of buyers who are
ineligible to purchase a handgun: convicted felons, the mentally
ill, drug addicts, fugitives, illegal aliens and those dishonorably
discharged from the military.
   The waiting period would take effect 90 days after the drug bill
became law.

   Pope John Paul II said today he was
saddened by the bloodshed that occurred during a shootout between
police and guerrillas that ended the hijacking of a busload of
pilgrims on their way to see him.
   All four gunmen and two of the hostages on the bus _ a
14-year-old girl and a 55-year-old man _ died from the Wednesday
night gun battle, the state-run South Africa Broadcasting Corp.
said.
   Three gunman and the schoolgirl died during the shootout, while
the fourth hijacker and the other passenger died today from
injuries, the SABC reported. Twenty pilgrims, including two nuns,
were injured in the shooting, papal officials said.
   The pope made his first public comment on the incident at the
end of a Mass he celebrated today to beatify a French evangelist.
Two million worshipers had been expected to attend the Mass at a
race course, but only 50,000 turned up in damp chilly weather.
   ``I have come to southern Africa as a pilgrim of peace, bearing
with me a message of reconciliation,'' the pontiff said. ``I am
saddened to learn that others on their way to join me in this
pilgrimage have been the victims of a hijack that caused such
anguish and ended in bloodshed.''
   Later the pope visited the Queen Elizabeth II hospital and met
with several of the injured.
   One of the hostages, French-Canadian nun Favrea Blanche told The
Star, a Johannesburg daily, that the shootout lasted 15 minutes and
that the hijackers had behaved politely and said they wanted peace
in Lesotho.
   The gunmen were from the dissident Lesotho Liberation Army and
had demanded a meeting with the pope and Lesotho's King Moshoeshoe
II, officials said.
   ``They spoke gently with us,'' said Sister Blanche, 63, who has
lived in Lesotho for 37 years. ``They even had pills to treat
people with headaches and tummy problems.''
   The pope resumed his five-nation southern Africa tour after a
dramatic day in which bad weather forced the papal plane to divert
to Johannesburg in South Africa, which the pontiff had been trying
to avoid.
   A heavily guarded 10-vehicle convoy took the pope to Lesotho by
road through South Africa, where racial issues had led Catholic
bishops to advise against a papal visit. Minutes after John Paul
reached Maseru, shooting broke out between police and gunmen
holding about 70 Catholic pilgrims hostage in a bus in the capital.
   ``One of our students is dead,'' said Sister Rita Brassard, an
American with the Papal Visit Office.
   ``Survivors said there were bullets everywhere. These little
grenades went off. They tried to jump through the windows,'' she
said.
   South African police, invited by Lesotho's military government,
led the assault against the gunmen after the hijackers started
shooting and tried to drive the bus into the grounds of the British
High Commission, or embassy. One gunman was taken alive. The
hijackers had complained that Britain was training Lesotho's
security forces.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquim Navarro said the pope learned of the
shooting after he returned from an evening Mass in a small church
at the tomb of the Rev. Joseph Gerard, at Roma outside Maseru.
   The ceremony to beatify Father Gerard, the first step toward
sainthood, took place under a cliff overlooking a large meadow at
the edge the city. Cows grazed in some areas cordoned off for
worshipers.
   Catholic officials said they believed cool and cloudy weather,
news of the bus hijack and the cost of temporary housing in Maseru
had cut the numbers of pilgrims far below expectations. Some tents
erected for worshipers were rented for $20 a night _ a huge sum for
many Africans.
   Father Gerard was a missionary in southern Africa in the 19th
century and was the first to take the Catholic faith to the Basotho
people. Before his death in 1914, he met little success in changing
tribal customs of polygamy and traditional medicine. He failed to
convert Moshoeshoe I, the Basotho king.
   Miracles were reported after Gerard died in 1914. A young girl
placed soil from his grave around her neck and reportedly was cured
of blindness in 1928. King Moshoeshoe II, whom John Paul was to
meet later Thursday, is a Catholic and 40 percent of Lesotho's 1.6
million people are Catholics.

   Termites taste like fish, palm grubs
resemble pork sausages, and ants can remind one of goose-liver
pate, says anthropologist Darna Dufour.
   Sound tasty? Well, Dufour says, ``in the jungle, insects are
good to eat.''
   That was the theme of her lecture on insect cuisine Wednesday at
the University of Colorado Museum. It was a prelude to the museum's
``Bug Day Afternoon'' Saturday, when children and adventurous
adults will scour fields for large grasshoppers _ not to eat but to
enter in the ``Big Hopper'' competition.
   Dufour dined on such delicacies as ants, termites, beetles and
caterpillars during a 16-month study of the eating habits of the
Tukanoan Indians of eastern Colombia.
   In her research along the Colombian-Brazilian border, Dufour
found that the Tukanoans consumed insects as a food supplement and
sometimes as a sole source of nourishment when fish weren't
available.
   Natives preferred to harvest some of the insects, particularly
termites and ants, in larvae stages ``when they're highest in fat
and protein content,'' she said. Sometimes, insects like ants are
used as a spread for bread and the ants resembled ``bacon bit sort
of things,'' she said.
   Although some caterpillars are saved, most of the insects
collected are eaten rapidly. ``It's a hand-to-mouth situation with
insects,'' she said.
   Dufour said that after overcoming some initial queasiness, she
learned to like some insects.
   While westerners are repulsed about consuming caterpillars, she
added, the Tukanoans don't particularly like some foods, either.
   Milk ``makes them want to vomit,'' she said. And eggs and
chicken are out, because chickens are seen as scavengers.

   Bob J. Crisman
went nose-to-nose with George Washington and didn't like what he
saw.
   Crismore ventured onto Mount Rushmore this week to inspect and
patch the four granite faces as part of the memorial's annual fall
maintenance program.
   In 40-degree temperatures and a gusty breeze Monday morning,
Crisman stood on the two-story nose of George Washington and dipped
his blade in a bucket of ``putty.''
   The nose had hundreds of cracks.
   He's glad when the job is done, when he no longer is hanging in
a sling seat 300 feet above ground.
   Crisman, 39, is only the fifth person to perform the maintenance
duties since carving of the memorial ceased in October 1941. He has
worked on the memorial for the past decade.
   He applies the putty _ a concoction of white lead, linseed oil
and granite dust _ each year to prevent moisture from damaging the
rock.
   For his hazardous duty, the National Park Service gives Crisman
a 25 percent ``environmental differential'' to go where few men
have gone before.
   ``When you've got time to think about it, it's neat to be here,
to be walking in the steps of the men who created this memorial,''
he said.

<HEAD>Carter Says Pledge Of Allegiance Flap is Non-Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter, taking issue with
Republican campaign attacks centered on the Pledge of Allegiance,
says he respects the flag but probably would refuse to recite the
pledge if ordered to do so by the government.
   Republican presidential nominee George Bush has criticized
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts,
for vetoing a proposed law that would have required teachers to
lead students in the flag pledge.
   Carter, in remarks to students Wednesday night at Emory
University where he is a professor, said the issue is an important
one for Dukakis.
   ``I think Dukakis was taken aback, caught by surprise, that he
didn't know what to do. I think he is in a hole now,'' said Carter,
a co-chairman of Dukakis' Georgia campaign. ``If he can explain it
away, it could give him a victory or it could cost him.''
   As for the issue itself, Carter said, ``I have great respect for
the flag, (but) if the government ... passed a law saying that I
had to pledge allegiance to the flag, I don't think I would do it.''
   He continued: ``I have always felt that I lived in a country ...
where if I wanted to worship God as a Baptist I could do so. If I
were an atheist, I could be one. If I wanted to be a Catholic but
was born a Jew, there's no condemnation ... from a government
authority.''
   Carter also expressed displeasure over the decision of his
former national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, to join the
Bush campaign as an adviser.
   ``I don't like it at all,'' Carter said, but he praised
Brzezinski for not criticizing Carter's policy after Carter left
the White House.

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's top health
official said Thursday he will not take a position on a proposed
White House ban on using intentionally aborted fetal tissue for
medical treatment until a National Institutes of Health advisory
committee has completed its review of the issue.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen told reporters
that _ while he remains personally opposed to abortion _ ``there
are some good pros and some good cons'' about using aborted fetal
tissue for experimental treatment for Parkinson's and other
diseases.
   He said ``a task force of the best minds going'' was studing the
issue at a three-day NIH meeting and that he had no intention of
taking a position until the review is completed, probably not for
several weeks.
   Bowen said he could not predict whether the issue will be
resolved during the last few months of the Reagan administration
even though a White House official, Gary Bauer, is pushing for
quick implementation of an outright ban.
   ``Inasmuch as abortions are legal, being unable to utilize the
tissue ... would result in the waste of a resource that is
livesaving and curing for several diseases,'' Bowen told reporters
at a breakfast meeting. He spoke at about the same time the NIH
panel he referred to was opening a second day of hearings to focus
on moral and ethical issues.
   Bowen said it was his judgment that ``we can't in a good common
sense way come up with an answer until we hear'' from the advisory
panel.
   ``If I had Parkinson's I think I would want some of those
(transplanted) cells,'' said Bowen, emphasizing that such a
personal observation does not eliminate the broader ethical
questions.
   He made clear he did not feel rushed to recommend an
administration position even though a Bauer memo disclosed in news
accounts last week instructed Bowen to make his comments by last
Friday.
   ``We have not responded,'' Bowen said. ``I do not know whether
it was a direct order from the president and I don't know that I
will know unless someone tells me.''
   Procedurally, the special NIH committee will make its
recommendations to a standing NIH advisory committee Dec. 1 and
that panel in turn will make a recommendation to NIH Director James
B. Wyngaarden. The NIH director reports to Bowen through Dr. Robert
E. Windom who ordered a temporary ban on federally financed fetal
tissue research pending consideration of moral and ethical issues.
   Father Don McCarthy, a Roman Catholic church leader from
Cincinnati, told the NIH committee the issue draws a clear
distinction between induced abortions and natural abortions.
   ``One might say that the American public becomes accomplices
after the fact for these induced abortions'' if its institutions
embrace policies that could tend to assign a medical value to
having an abortion, he said.
   Several witnesses and committee members used the term ``custom
pregnancy'' as short hand for the concern that a woman might become
pregnant just to produce a fetus for abortion and subsequent
research use _ either for financial reward or in hopes of helping a
sick relative.
   ``I don't think people are as callous about abortion as that
premise suggests,'' said Thomas H. Murray, director of the Center
for Biomedical Ethics at the Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland. ``If we get to that point, I'm deeply worried.''
   Murray said he was convinced that guidelines could be drawn to
insure that a woman's decision to have an abortion would be kept
totally separate from the decision to allow the remains to be used
for research.
   Robert J. Levine of the Yale University School of Medicine told
the committee his institution has drawn its own guidelines that
would exclude transplanting the tissue of an fetus into a relative
of the mother.
   He said that was done out of safety considerations _ that
whatever caused the disease in the relative might somehow be
present in the offspring's genes _ but coincidentally also serves
to negate concern about ``custom pregnancies.''
   Ezra C. Davidson Jr., head of the obstetrics and gynecology
department at King-Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles, said he was
distressed that some committee members seemed to underestimate
``the intensity of the drive for (many) women to have abortions to
resolve a very complex set of problems'' without any encouragement
from researchers or others.
   ``I just wish I had the capacity to translate the reality of
that to the people in this room,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pope Meets Injured After Bus Hijack, Denounces Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS REDMONT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MASERU, Lesotho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Thursday comforted
pilgrims injured in a bus hijacking in this mountain kingdom and
criticized militants who believe violence can solve southern
Africa's conflicts.
   ``I am saddened to learn that others on their way to join me on
this pilgrimage have been victims of a hijack that has caused such
anguish and ended in bloodshed,'' John Paul said the day after
police stormed the bus with four hijackers and 71 hostages aboard.
   All four hijackers and two passengers died, including a
14-year-old girl, officials said. Twenty others were injured.
   The pope spoke to a crowd of about 15,000 standing on a soggy
field. Organizers expected 1 million and blamed the hijacking,
rainy winter weather and expensive accommodations _ such as
$25-dollar-a-night tents _ for the small turnout.
   Speaking at an afternoon youth rally, John Paul urged his
followers to ``renounce every form of violence and hatred.'
   ``The increase of violence in the world can never be halted by
responding with more of the same,'' he said.
   In an apparent criticism of some militants, including activists
who contend passive resistance cannot overcome South Africa's
system of racial segregation, the pope said: ``There could be
nothing further from the truth. There is nothing passive about
non-violence.''
   A South African police anti-terrorist unit, working with Lesotho
security forces, gunned down the hijackers Wednesday night, 27
hours after the bus driver and the pilgrims, including nuns and
schoolgirls, were taken hostage.
   The shootout occurred only 20 minutes after the pope drove
across the border from South Africa, where his plane had been
diverted because of bad weather in Maseru.
   John Paul on Thursday visited the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital
where the injured _ 11 men and nine women _ were being treated. He
passed out Vatican medals and rosaries as he chatted with them.
   Earlier, at an open-air Mass, he beatified the Rev. Joseph
Gerard, a 19th-century French missionary in Lesotho. Beatification
is the first step on the road to sainthood.
   The Lesotho government, run by a military council that has good
relations with South Africa, said hijacking was ended with the
``inevitable and unavoidable'' cooperation of our ``one and very
powerful neighbor.''
   The government said the hijackers ordered the driver to crash
the bus through the closed gate of the British High Commission
while they began shooting. The government did not say why the
hijackers decided to move after more than a day's standoff, but
there were unconfirmed reports that the gunmen may have been
alarmed by police searchlights which suddenly were focused on the
bus.
   Several of the rescued hostages said the hijackers rigged the
bus with explosives.
   The government tried to forestall any criticism from African
countries that have accused it of being too cooperative with South
Africa. It said it uses police advisers from Britain, West Germany
and Israel and has a military training program with the United
States.
   The gunman called for a return to civilian rule in Lesotho. They
also demanded to meet the pope, King Moshoeshoe II and Britain's
high commissioner.
   King Moshoeshoe II, a practicing Catholic, skipped the
beatification ceremony without public explanation, although his
name was listed on the program.
   Queen Tabitha, however, was present as well as the chairman of
the ruling military council, Maj. Gen. Justin Lekhanya.
   The 50-year-old Oxford-educated king scheduled a meeting
Thursday evening with the pope at the royal palace. The ceremony
was to include some traditional Basotho ethnic festivities that
were canceled Wednesday when the papal plane from Botswana was
diverted to South Africa.

<HEAD>Residents Find Way To Get Reluctant Candidates Into Office</HEAD>

   You don't have to campaign to get elected
mayor or City Council member in this town of 299 people.
   ``They all say they don't want the job and, when they get
elected, they take the job,'' said City Clerk Bonnie Delvaux, who
once nearly got elected mayor against her will.
   ``The residents get all hot and bothered a week before election,
saying, `Hey, got to get some people in office,''' said council
member Pat Thorson. ``You kind of draft people.''
   Tuesday was the deadline for candidates in the town in
east-central Minnesota to get their names on the November ballot
for two council seats. Council members get $300 a year.
   No one filed for nomination, according to Delvaux, who said she
can't recall anyone seeking the nomination for the council or
mayor's job in the 11 years she's been clerk.
   ``It's a close-knit town, but nobody wants to be in charge,''
Delvaux said. ``They don't want to be the one that gets
(criticized) if the council makes the wrong decision.'' Delvaux
said.
   So, with blank ballots, elections often are last-minute,
write-in campaigns. If no one asks for their vote, residents just
decide among themselves which of their neighbors deserves the job,
Delvaux said.
   The winner usually serves, Delvaux said.
   Thorson herself didn't file and didn't run for re-election four
years ago. ``I didn't really want the job,'' she said.
   But Thorson said other council members decided she should be
re-elected and spread. ``It was so overwhelming, and it made me
feel so good, I took it,'' she said.
   But Thorson, a 10-year council veteran, vows not to take the job
again, even if elected. Jack Weinzettel, the other council member
whose seat is up for election, said he hasn't decided whether to
seek re-election.

<HEAD>Iraq Hints U.N. Team Not Welcome, Says Chemical Gas Use Was
`Impossible'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq indicated Thursday that it may not
allow the U.N. to come to Iraq to investigate allegations that Iraq
used poison gas on Kurdish rebels.
   It also said it was ``impossible'' for the Iraqi army to use
chemical weapons in the Kurds' mountainous region.
   But in Washington, Reagan administration officials said
intercepted military radio conversations between Iraqi forces
helped convince U.S. officials that Iraq had gassed the Kurds.
   Turkey meanwhile said it would not agree to a U.N. request to
send experts into Turkey to investigate the poison gas claims.
   Iraqi Defense Minister Adnan Khairallah told a news conference
in Baghdad that he didn't understand why the United Nations should
be involved in any investigation.
   ``If the Kurds are Iraqis, it's an internal issue. So what is
the role of the United Nations in this case?'' he said.
   On Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar asked
the Iraqi government to let U.N. chemical experts conduct an
investigation about chemical weapons use against the Kurds in Iraq.
   The United Nations and other international bodies have several
times censured Iraq and Iran for using chemical weapons in their
8-year conflict.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz acknowledged on July 1 that
his country had used deadly chemical weapons against Iran, but he
said the Iranians used them first.
   Khairallah on Thursday reiterated Iraqi claims that no such
gases have been used against the Kurds.
   He said it was technically impossible for the Iraqi military to
use gas against the Kurds during the anti-rebel offensive Aug. 27
to Sept. 3, shortly after last month's cease-fire with Iran began.
   The offensive caused 60,000 thousand Kurds to flee into
neighboring Turkey.
   About 20 million Kurds who live in a region where the borders of
Turkey, Iran and Iraq converge have been fighting for independence
for the past century.
   The minister said chemical weapons create a heavy gas that would
have clung to the valleys of the mountainous region and made it
impossible for Iraqi troops to enter the area.
   The U.N. investigation request, prompted by the United States,
Japan, Britain and West Germany, also called for a team of experts
to be sent to Turkey.
   But in Ankara, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Turkey wouldn't
accept the team.
   ``We trust our own experts and we expect others to do so,'' said
Inal Batu, the spokesman.
   He said the presence of a U.N. team of experts here would
signify that Turkey had a ``direct part in the affair.''
   In Washington, Reagan administration officials said Iraqi radio
conversations involving the use of gas turned up in the course of
``routine electronic surveillance'' in the Persian Gulf region.
   The radio conversations were between Iraqi aircraft and ground
bases and between different Iraqi aircraft, the sources said on
condition of anonymity.
   One official said the United States did not have what he would
call ``incontrovertible evidence'' like used gas canisters to prove
that chemical weapons had been used.
   ``But the intercepted radio messages and other signs make it
clear to us what is going on,'' said another source.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said this week he was
``quite confident'' that Iraq had used chemical weapons in its
efforts to put down a rebellion by the Kurds. But he refused at the
time to spell out the basis for the assertion.
   That assertion prompted the U.S. Senate to vote to impose
economic sanctions against Iraq. The bill must also pass the House
of Representatives before it goes to President Reagan.
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, refused to discuss
the matter on Thursday, saying he never discussed intelligence
matters.

<TEXT>
   Anchorage learned Thursday it won't be
host for the 1994 Winter Olympic Games, but the city's failed bid
didn't stop some from dreaming about 1998.
   Hundreds of people jammed the Egan Civic & Convention Center to
watch the televised announcement of Lillehammer, Norway, as the
1994 host city.
   Anchorage finished third out of four competing bids. Two years
ago, the city finished sixth in a field of seven competing for the
1992 Games.
   ``We knew getting the bid would not be an easy task. We knew
that going in, but it would have been nice to have seen us place a
little higher,'' said Dennis Branson, a member of the Anchorage
Organizing Committee's executive panel.
   Branson said he hoped the committee will reorganize and prepare
for a 1998 Winter Olympic proposal.
   ``The third time's the charm,'' he said.
   Alaska Sen. Frank Murkowski, who headed the delegation lobbying
on Anchorage's behalf before the International Olympic Committee,
said in a telephone interview from South Korea that the city's two
bids would pay off.
   ``Anchorage is an odds-on favorite next time,'' he predicted.
``I think it's an investment. I'd be terribly disappointed if there
was any thought to not going full speed ahead in 1998.''
   Gov. Steve Cowper said he would make a push for a 1998 bid.
   ``Alaskans aren't quitters. We've got what it takes to make
dreams come true. Now let's get ready for 1998,'' he said.
   Anchorage voters last month voted 2-1 in favor of the city
assuming financial responsibility for the 1994 Winter Olympics.
   But not everybody was disappointed with the choice of
Lillehammer.
   Doug Bartko of Palmer is a spokesman for Alaskans Concerned
About The Proposed Winter Olympics, which doesn't oppose the
Olympics, only their being in Alaska.
   He said his group philosophically opposes the selection of
Anchorage. ``People live here to get away from the commercialism
and hype and there is a lot of that involved in the Olympics,'' he
said.
   ``I think Lillehammer is an excellent choice,'' Bartko said.

   The most intense hurricane on record
surged toward Texas today after battering the Yucatan Peninsula
with 160 mph winds, leveling slums, pummeling posh resorts and
forcing tens of thousands to flee.
   Hurricane Gilbert, which has left nearly one in four Jamaicans
homeless, slackened somewhat as it swirled over land, but the storm
was beginning to gain strength over open water as it moved toward
the U.S. Gulf Coast with sustained winds of 120 mph.
   The storm was headed west northwest, said National Hurricane
Center director Bob Sheets. It was moving at 15 mph and dumping up
to 10 inches of rain.
   ``The area that we have the most likely possibility that this
hurricane will make landfall is in the northern part of Mexico or
the southeastern, southern part of Texas,'' he said.
   At 3 p.m. today, the center of the storm was near latitude 22.3
north and longitude 92.9 west, or about 380 miles southeast of
Brownsville, Texas, the National Weather Service said.
   Brownsville was given a 21 percent probability of being hit,
though a hurricane watch was in effect along the entire Texas coast
as well as the northeastern Mexican coast from Tampico.
   Earlier this week the storm struck the Carribean, ravaging
Jamaica, the Dominican Repubic, the Cayman Islands and Haiti,
killing at least 19 in Jamaica and five in the Dominican Republic.
   Haiti declared a state of emergency across its southern
peninsula, where at least 10 hurricane-related deaths have been
reported.
   The storm, about 450 miles wide, hit the Yucatan coast at dawn
Wednesday, thrashing beaches with 23-foot waves, uprooting trees,
knocking out electricity and water supplies and severing telephone
lines.
   Mexican officials reported at least seven injuries. There were
no reports of deaths.
   Gilbert battered the provincial capital of Merida and the gulf
port cities of Puerto Progreso, Campeche and Ciudad del Carmen,
closing airports and roads and knocking out communications and
power and innundating streets and highways.
   About 20,000 people were evacuated from Puerto Progreso and
other coastal towns, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry in
Mexico City said by telephone today. Hundreds of homes were
destroyed, he said.
   The ministry said the storm seriously damaged the luxury hotel
zone in the resort of Cancun and destroyed about a quarter of the
homes on the nearby island of Cozumel. Ham radio operators in
Mexico City also told The Associated Press they had reports of
massive damage to several hotels.
   Authorities were particularly concerned about the people trapped
on another resort island just off Cancun, tiny Isla Mujeres.
   A navy spokesman in Mexico City said he had no word on the
plight of an estimated 15,000 people stranded there. Three ferries
linking the island with the mainland were lost in the storm, but
there were no reports of casualties.
   In Campeche, boats were driven onto the street running along the
waterfront, Ramon Castillo, a night watchman at the newspaper
Novedades of Campeche, said in a telephone interview.
   ``There is no light, there is no radio, there is nothing. There
is much damage. The whole city is flooded,'' he said.
   Sheets said the hurricane was expected to hit land midday Friday
and that its sustained winds would today ``certainly increase to
130, 140 miles per hour.''
   ``It's going to have an impact over a fairly large area,''
Sheets said on CBS-TV's ``This Morning.''
   ``Those major destructive winds are going to be in there fairly
tight close to the center. But the impacts are going to be felt
over most of the Texas area.''
   The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on
record in terms of barometric pressure, which was measured at 26.31
inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane
that devastated the Florida Keys.
   In the Yucatan state capital of Merida, the storm's 160 mph
winds destroyed nearly all the thatched houses in one district,
uprooted trees, road signs and cut off water supplies, said
Gonzalez Correa, news editor of Novedades.
   A spokeswoman with the National Civil Defense System in Mexico
City said at least 20,000 people had flocked to Merida from coastal
areas.
   Civil defense officials said 6,000 tourists left beachside
motels and 30,000 local people also sought temporary shelter. U.S.
consular officials said they did not know how many tourists were in
Cancun, which receives about 50,000 visitors per month.
   The storm, spawned Saturday southeast of Puerto Rico, appeared
to have hit Jamaica the hardest. That island nation's prime
minister, Edward Seaga, said Wednesday that it destroyed about
100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes. He estimated damage at $8
billion.
   Earlier Wednesday, Gilbert was classified as a Category 5 storm,
the strongest and deadliest type of hurricane. Such storms have
maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause
catastrophic damage.
   By Wednesday night, the National Hurricane Center downgraded it
to a Category 4 and to a Category 3 by this morning.
   Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _ the
1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and Hurricane Camille,
which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed 256
people.

<TEXT>
   Afghan air raids and shellings across
the Pakistan border have killed 40 people and injured 114 since
Soviet troops began leaving Afghanistan on May 15, a government
spokesman said Thursday.
   Afghan troops violated Pakistani air space and territory 295
times from May 15 to Aug. 18, the Pakistani official charged.
   Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United States and the Soviet Union
signed a U.N.-sponsored accord on April 14 to arrange a pullout of
an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops that have been helping the
Afghan government fight U.S.-backed rebels. Half of them have gone
home, while the rest are to leave by Feb. 15.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 27
people were killed and 85 injured in Afghan artillery shelling of
Pakistani border areas. He said 13 died and 29 were injured in air
raids and bombings.
   He told reporters that more Afghan aircraft have been violating
Pakistani air space in recent weeks.
   Pakistani F-16 fighters engaged an Afghan warplane on September
7, and the army has claimed that the plane was shot down.
Afghanistan has denied the claim.
   ``Pakistan air force has proof on film that the raiding warplane
was shot down,'' the spokesman said.
   He said efforts were continuing to locate the wreckage of the
warplane.
   Asked to comment on Kabul's allegations that the Pakistani army
is helping anti-communist guerrillas fight Afghan security forces
in southeastern Afghanistan, the spokesman said ``its completely
baseless.''
   The spokesman said Islamabad might play a role in a prisoner of
war exchange, using its influence with the guerrillas to free
Soviet POWs.
   ``But there are no Soviet POWs on Pakistani territory, and if
and when there were any, we handed them over to the Soviets,'' he
said.
   A Pakistani newspaper, the Frontier Post, reported Thursday that
Pakistan is mediating between the Soviets and the rebels in
arranging the release of 300 Soviet POWs.
   ``It is premature to say that an agreement has been reached,''
the spokesman said.
   Rebel sources have never disclosed the number of Soviet war
prisoners but different resistence groups are believed to hold
around 50. They say the prisoners are being held in Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
   A man whose car crashed at high speed into
a wedding limousine, killing the bride, groom and best man, was
found guilty Thursday of three counts of criminally negligent
homicide.
   The victims' families burst into applause as the verdict was
read.
   Vincent Laezza, 21, of Selden, had also been charged with
manslaughter in the April 3, 1987, collision, but was acquitted of
that more serious charge.
   In addition to the criminally negligent homicide counts, Laezza
was convicted of one count of second-degree assault for seriously
injuring the bride's sister and attendant.
   He was acquitted of assault in the injuring of the limousine
driver.
   The maximum sentence for criminally negligent homicide is one
and one-third to four years in prison. The sentence for assault can
be 2{ to seven years.
   The crash killed Carol Zagorski Phillips and Peter Phillips less
than an hour after they were married, and Phillips' brother and
best man, John Phillips.
   Debra Zagorski, the bride's sister, and Thomas Quinn, the
limousine driver, were injured.
   The jury had listened to two weeks of testimony and had begun
deliberations Thursday morning.
   Laezza allegedly was drag racing at up to 100 mph in Lido Beach,
on Long Island, when his car hit the limousine broadside as it was
turning into the Sands Catering Hall for the wedding reception.
   The speed limit on Lido Boulevard was 35 mph, according to
prosecutor George Peck.
   Laezza was remanded to the Nassau County Jail, until his Oct. 14
sentencing. During trial, he had been free on $750,000 bail.
   During closing arguments Wednesday, Laezza's attorney, Eugene
Shaffer, had told the Nassau County jury that the limousine driver
caused the accident by making a sudden turn left, cutting across
Laezza's pathway.

   A 64-year-old West German man died
from severe burns, raising the death toll from last month's
Ramstein air show disaster to 63, a state official said Thursday.
   The victim died in a Stuttgart hospital late Wednesday, said
Juergen Dietzen, spokesman for Rhineland-Palatinate state.
   Dietzen said 153 people remained hospitalized in 46 hospitals as
a result of the Aug. 28 accident. He said at least 25 were in very
serious to critical condition.
   The accident occurred during a 10-airplane Italian Air Force
stunt team performance in which three of the jets collided. One of
the planes plowed into the crowd and exploded, and the other two
crashed a short distance away.
   The dead are 56 West Germans, a U.S. soldier and her 9-year-old
son, one French citizen, one Dutch citizen, and the three Italian
pilots.

<HEAD>Bentsen Says GOP Barbs Are Backfiring, Democrats on Upswing</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen said Thursday the
Republicans' negative campaign is backfiring and that the Democrats
are on the upswing.
   The Democratic vice presidential nominee, on a Southern campaign
swing through his native Texas, Louisiana and Tennessee, told a
rally in Shreveport, La., that GOP nominee George Bush had done
nothing for oil-producing states during his eight years as vice
president.
   ``In all candor, their energy policy is the political equivalent
of a dry hole,'' Bentsen said.
   Reciting several anti-energy positions taken by Bush and his
running mate, Dan Quayle, Bentsen mentioned Quayle's opposition to
an oil import fee, which Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis has
also opposed.
   A new Washington Post-ABC News poll showed the Democratic ticket
leading the Republicans nationwide by 48 percent to 45 percent.
Although the lead was within the survey's margin of error, Bentsen
said it reflected the Democrats' success in countering Republican
charges that they were unpatriotic and weak on defense.
   ``We've seen in the last four or five days, as we've taken these
issues on, on defense, and these ... outrageous charges on
patriotism, that the polls have turned around,'' Bentsen told
reporters. ``It's obvious that we have bottomed out and we're
beginning to come back up.''
   The Democrats grabbed a big lead in the polls after their
nominating convention in Atlanta in mid-July, but that lead
evaporated and they fell behind the Bush-Quayle ticket in some
recent polls.
   Bentsen said Republicans were trying to ``impugn the loyalty and
patriotism of the candidates'' but they had ``overreached and they
are getting a backlash.'' Bentsen said.
   ``I think they've got the problem now,'' said the senator, who
elicited a chorus of boos from his Shreveport audience when he
mentioned the GOP campaign.
   Bentsen was heckled Wednesday when he told defense workers near
Dallas that Bush had unfairly accused Dukakis of opposing most
defense programs.
   On the gun control issue, Bentsen defended Dukakis' position
while seeking to minimize his own differences with the
Massachusetts governor.
   Bentsen said he would vote against a proposed national,
mandatory seven-day waiting period for handgun purchases, which
Dukakis supports.
   ``I think that has some validity to it, but I believe it ought
to be done on a state-by-state basis because you have a great deal
of difference in the urbanization of various states,'' Bentsen told
reporters.
   ``What you might apply in Montana could be quite different from
a heavily urbanized, industrialized state that has different crime
problems,'' he said.
   Bentsen refused to say what he would do if he were elected vice
president and, as president of the Senate, had to break a tie floor
vote on the issue.
   But he said Dukakis was not the anti-gun fanatic that
Republicans claim he is.
   Although Dukakis supports gun registration and other
restrictions, ``he's a man who believes you ought to be able to own
a gun within the laws of your particular state'' to protect the
home and for hunting and recreational purposes, Bentsen said.
   ``The idea that he is going to confiscate guns without
compensation, as I read one of the charges _ that's ridiculous,''
he said.
   Bentsen's plan was to campaign in North Carolina and Florida on
Friday and Saturday and then return to Washington, but he might
alter his schedule because Hurricane Gilbert was headed toward the
Gulf Coast of Texas.
   He said he ruled out visiting Galveston, Texas, on Thursday to
view emergency preparations for the hurricane's arrival because he
did not want to contribute to the burden of local officials. But he
said he might return to his home state after the storm to assess
relief needs.

<HEAD>U.S. Faults Soviets For Slow Progress Toward Arms Reduction
Negotiations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department acknowledged Thursday
that after 19 months of trying to set up negotiations to reduce
NATO and Warsaw Pact forces in Europe differences with Moscow over
human rights were blocking progress.
   The preliminary talks in Vienna were designed to overcome a
stalemate over conventional cutbacks in troops and armor in Central
Europe. At the same, the geography was expanded to cover the
continent all the way from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains
in the Soviet Union.
   The talks opened in February 1987 with a new sense of optimism
both in Washington and in Moscow that East-West tensions could be
reduced through sizable reductions in the forces the two military
alliances have concentrated in Europe since World War II.
   But Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said U.S.
hopes that the Soviets would be willing to give equal consideration
to improvements in human rights conditions at home had not been
borne out.
   ``We have to have this balance between the arms control aspects
of this,'' the U.S. official said. ``Until we get this there is no
prospect we are going to conclude negotiations.''
   Next month will mark 15 years of inconclusive negotiations with
the Soviets over reducing non-nuclear forces in Central Europe. The
talks in Vienna were designed to break the stalemate. Hopes for
success were heightened as the United States and the Soviet Union
successfully concluded a treaty last year to abolish their
intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   But Redman said apart from human rights there were ``still a few
areas to be nailed down,'' including technical details of the broad
area to be covered by the negotiations.
   The U.S. official declined to describe the Vienna talks as
stalemated. ``I would not say that,'' Redman said. ``It's a very
active negotiations.''
   Redman said the U.S. delegation in the Austrian capital would
keep pushing for an ``early conclusion'' to the talks. But, he
said, ``it takes two sides to make this work.''
   The spokesman declined to predict whether negotiations between
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact would be
opened before President Reagan leaves office in January.
   ``There are no artificial deadlines,'' he said. ``There are just
some very important considerations that need to be met.''
   He stressed the disagreement over human rights was the principal
roadblock. ``We've been pushing hard to get this wrapped up and to
get these talks under way, if that's possible, but without
sacrificing this crucial aspect of balance,'' Redman said.
   The slow progress in Vienna is bound to be on the agenda when
Secretary of State George P. Shultz meets here next week with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.

American company aboard the European Ariane rocket has failed to
achieve a usable orbit and efforts will be made to nudge it into
its proper place.
   ``We are trying to move the satellite into its orbital
location,'' said Barbara Foelber, spokeswoman for GTE Spacenet
Corp., which owns the GSTAR 3 satellite. The spacecraft, launched
Sept. 8, was to have been used for private business communications.
   She said engineers don't know the cause of the problem. The
satellite reached the 22,300-mile altitude required and the rocket
motor fired to put it into a circular orbit. The firing apparently
was not long enough and the satellite was put into an egg-shaped
course around the Earth.
   The spokeswoman said engineers will attempt to fire small
thrusters, normally used to keep the satellite from drifting out of
position, to gently push the satellite into a path where its speed
matches the rotation of Earth. That maneuver has been performed
successfully before, notably with the Tracking and Data Relay
Satellite launched by NASA in 1983.
   The satellite, which cost $85 million to $100 million to build
and launch, was insured for $60 million, Ms. Foelber said.
   ``We currently have five satellites in orbit,'' she said. ``We
will be able to provide ... services needed'' by the company's
customers, she added.
   GTE has another in the series of GE Astro satellites scheduled
for launching in April 1991 and Ms. Foelber said the company will
try to move its launch date ahead.

   NASA's Johnson Space Center all but shut down
Thursday, with most employees sent home to prepare for a possible
assault by Hurricane Gilbert.
   The center, normally open for visitors every day but Christmas,
was closed at noon. All but a core group of employees were allowed
to go home and told they didn't have to come back until Monday,
spokesman James Hartsfield said.
   If the hurricane causes little or no damage at the space center,
Hartsfield said, it would probably have no affect on the expected
launch of the first post-Challenger flight at Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
later this month.
   There are more than 9,000 workers at the space center, including
government employees and people who work for private companies that
have contracts with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   NASA officials wanted to allow employees time to secure their
homes, get supplies or leave the area if they chose to do so
because of the threat Gilbert posed to the Texas coast. The space
center is about 25 miles from the coast.
   A core group will remain throughout the weekend at Mission
Control, the strongest building at the center and the place where
shuttle missions are controlled, Hartsfield said. Mission Control
has concrete walls and no windows.
   ``If the storm hurts that, we're really in trouble,'' he said.
   Past storms have caused flooding at the center, disrupting
communications and computer operations.
   The long-awaited launch of Discovery is expected to take place
sometime in late September, but NASA officials said Wednesday they
would wait to set an exact date until they knew more about where
the storm would go. They may announce a launch date Friday.
   At Cape Canaveral on Thursday, engineers corrected a tiny leak
in Discovery's engine system. The leak, traced to a valve, was the
only unresolved technical problem when more than 150 shuttle
managers and engineers concluded a flight readiness review on
Wednesday.
   If a later hurricane headed for the Space Center area during a
shuttle flight, NASA is prepared to fly a group of flight
controllers to White Sands Missile Range, N.M., so the shuttle
could be controlled from there. The flight controllers could get to
White Sands within a few hours.
   Hurricane Gilbert was in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday and
seemed headed for the south Texas coast, but weather forecasters
warned it could turn northward and hit the Galveston area. The
space center is located between Galveston and Houston.
   Even if the storm did not hit the Galveston area, there still
could be heavy rains and winds in the area and possible flooding.

   John Thiry says he was doing motorists a favor
when he held up a sign telling them to slow down, but police on the
lookout for speeders nearby weren't impressed with his citizenship.
   They arrested him.
   ``I stopped a lot of people from having a miserable day,'' said
Thiry, who acknowledges wracking up $2,000 in traffic fines over
the years. ``People were beeping at me. They were waving. It's
about time somebody did something.''
   Thiry, 22, of Pittsburgh was arrested Wednesday for obstructing
traffic after he stood in a street called Schenley Park Plaza with
a sign saying, ``Slow down. Police ahead with VASCAR.''
   Thiry was just ahead of where police were using a VASCAR device
to catch speeders. The device, akin to a stop watch, calculates a
car's speed by measuring the time it takes for a car to travel
between two lines painted across the street a carefully measured
distance apart.
   ``I stood there for about 20 minutes,'' Thiry said. ``That would
have been about a total of $3,000 they would have gotten people
for.''
   Thiry said Pittsburgh police often ``trap'' motorists with
VASCAR devices. ``They make you go 25 (mph) where they know 25 is
an unreasonably slow speed,'' he said. ``Try and go the speed limit
and just see what happens. See how many people pass you.''
   Police Chief Ralph Pampena said signs posted throughout the city
say police use VASCAR devices to enforce speed limits.
   ``The signs are very clear,'' he said. ``If the signs are posted
as 25 miles per hour, then that's the speed we expect people to
go.''
   Thiry said he was upset because he had been issued many tickets,
and recently lost his license for the third time and had to leave a
job as a salesman.
   The tickets included at least five in the past two years from
Pittsburgh police using VASCAR devices, plus others for speeding on
the interstate, he said. He estimated he has paid about $2,000 in
fines, but said has never been involved in a traffic accident.
   Police Sgt. Leo McCafferty and Officer William O'Rourke said
they noticed that motorists were suddenly driving slower as they
waited for speeders. They said they arrested Thiry after a motorist
informed them about his sign.
   Thiry, who was frisked by police, said he will appeal the charge
of obstructing traffic, which carries a fine of $48.50.
   ``I wasn't blocking traffic,'' Thiry said Thursday. ``I don't
think they had the right to arrest me because I wanted to warn
people. What if I was just yelling? That's freedom of speech.''
   Edward Patterson, commander of the traffic division, said the
officers acted properly in arresting Thiry.
   ``Anytime you're out in the street, you're obstructing
traffic,'' he said. ``He was standing there calling to attention to
the contents of a sign. It could contribute to an accident.''

<HEAD>Elvis Credit Card Issued By Memphis Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fans who still buy Elvis Presley
souvenirs now can pay for them with a flashy black credit card
bearing the singer's image.
   ``Give your autograph to Elvis. ... Become part of the legend,''
says a brochure advertising the Presley MasterCard.
   Applications were sent to 200,000 people around the country this
week, and Jack Soden, manager of Presley' former residence in
Memphis, said more than a million will be mailed over the next
couple of months.
   Soden said the MasterCard is being issued by Leader Federal
Savings and Loan of Memphis.
   The non-profit Elvis Presley Memorial Foundation will get half
the $36 annual fee for the MasterCard, and a portion of the 17.88
percent interest applied to card balances also will go to the
foundation, Soden said.
   He declined to say what portion of the interest charges will go
to the foundation or to estimate how much money the card will
generate.
   The foundation was set up in 1985 by executors of Presley's
estate but it has had little operating income, he said. The singer
died in 1977. Income from the credit card will support programs in
music education, for medical care for the underprivileged and for
assistance to the homeless, Soden said.
   The Elvis credit card has a black background with a drawing of
Presley in a singing pose with a guitar in his hands. The drawing
is surrounded by red and gold lights from a jukebox.
   ``The card is absolutely gorgeous,'' Soden said.
   More than 600,000 tourists and fans visit Graceland each year
and the Graceland complex, which includes a 36,000-square-foot
shopping center, takes in some $9 million a year. The estate is run
for the financial benefit of Presley's only child, Lisa Marie
Presley.

   Actor Tom Berenger, who has played a maniacal
slasher in ``Looking for Mr. Goodbar'' and a racist in
``Betrayed,'' says he enjoys playing the bad guy.
   ``I find something human in them, with the exception of `Mr.

such a slimy character with no redeeming qualities. To me it was
like playing Charles Manson. I had nightmares after I finished

   Yet when working on a role, Berenger says, he doesn't think
about his character's bad nature. ``You can't think that you're
playing a villain or you'll end up with a cartoon.''
   Berenger recently completed a script about an Irish rebellion
and included a part in it for him: ``the bad guy. Or, at least, the
insensitive one.''

   Former tennis champion Arthur Ashe was released
from a hospital Thursday after undergoing tests for a condition his
agent described as a ``severe bacterial infection'' in his head.
   The infection put pressure on nerves, causing numbness in Ashe's
arm, according to Ted Ewanciw, a spokesman for ProServ, Ashe's
agent. The 45-year-old former Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion
underwent treatment with antibiotics, which ``relieved the pressure
considerably,'' Ewanciw said.
   A spokeswoman for New York Hospital, Myrna Manners, declined to
comment except to say Ashe had been released Thursday after a
one-week stay, and that his condition had been satisfactory
throughout.
   Ashe retired from professional tennis in 1980, the year after he
underwent quadruple bypass surgery following a heart attack. He had
another heart attack and double bypass surgery four years later.
   In a telephone interview from his hospital room Monday, he said
the tests he was undergoing were unrelated to his earlier heart
problems.

   Nicotine gum can help smokers quit, but many
doctors give patients wrong instructions for its use, researchers
say.
   ``There is a widespread need for physician education about how
to use nicotine gum more effectively,'' said one of five studies on
smoking in Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Nearly 40 percent of the internists surveyed for the study said
they would prescribe nicotine gum to help patients cut down on
smoking, violating a key guideline for use of the gum.
   The first instruction on the gum package says, ``Starting now
you must give up smoking completely. Gradually cutting down on your
tobacco consumption will not work.''
   The study, based on a random survey of 208 internists in the San
Francisco Bay area, found that doctors' misconceptions about the
gum hurts efforts by smokers to quit.
   ``Misuse of the gum is most detrimental because the patients get
discouraged and don't think it works and then aren't able to quit
smoking,'' said Dr. Steven R. Cummings, an assistant medical
professor at UC-San Francisco. Cummings conducted the study with
colleagues at the University of California Medical School in San
Francisco.
   Incorrect advice from doctors also poses potential health risks,
the Cummings study concluded.
   Smoking while chewing the gum ``may produce higher serum
concentrations of nicotine than smoking alone, and this might
increase the risk of nicotine-related adverse effects,'' the report
said, while swallowing juices from the gum could increase ``the
chance of gastrointestinal side effects.''
   Most internists prescribe nicotine gum to fewer than 25 percent
of patients who try to quit smoking, the study found.
   But the gum _ a prescription drug marketed under the trade name
``Nicorette'' by Lakeside Pharmaceuticals of Cincinnati _ can be an
effective tool for some people trying to quit smoking, particularly
heavy smokers, conclude three other studies in the journal.
   One study found, however, that of 538 patients given nicotine
gum to help them quit smoking, 34, or 6.8 percent, were still
chewing it after a year.
   Those long-term gum chewers, generally heavy smokers, also
represented one-quarter of the patients who quit smoking for a
year, said the report by researchers at the University of London.
   A researcher in another study said the gum shouldn't be viewed
as a panacea.
   ``I don't think physicians ought to supply it just
willy-nilly,'' said Dr. Stephen P. Fortmann, an assistant professor
at the Stanford University School of Medicine.
   ``The gum shouldn't be seen as either a miracle or as a
necessity, but as a useful adjunct,'' Foreman said. He led a study
that found the drug effective and also that ``a large majority'' of
smokers trying to quit want self-administered, minimal-contact
treatment.
   A fifth study suggested that nicotine gum might help smokers who
consume more than 25 cigarettes daily overcome withdrawal symptoms
caused by their physical addiction.
   The manufacturer estimates 2 million people have quit smoking
using nicotine gum since it introduced in 1985. Bill Donaldson, a
spokesman for Lakeside, a division of Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals
Inc., said the company had no reports of patients becoming addicted
to nicotine from the gum itself.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Indicts Ashland Oil for Fuel Spill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury on Thursday indicted
Ashland Oil Inc. on charges it violated federal environmental laws
when more than 700,000 gallons of oil spilled into the Monongahela
River in January, fouling drinking water in three states.
   The indictment charged Ashland with misdemeanor violations of
the federal Clean Water Act and the Refuse Act. Environmental laws
do not contain felony provisions in such cases, so the misdemeanor
charges were the most stringent allowed, said U.S. Attorney J. Alan
Johnson.
   The spill occurred Jan. 2 when an Ashland Oil storage tank in
Jefferson, near Pittsburgh, collapsed as it was filled with 3.8
million gallons of oil. About 1 million gallons escaped the
containment dikes at the facility, and more than 700,000 gallons
spilled into the Monongahela River.
   The government said it was one of the largest inland oil spills
in the nation's history, affecting drinking water supplies and
plant and animal life in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia.
About 23,000 suburban Pittsburgh residents went without tap water
for almost a week.
   The criminal charges disappointed Ashland Oil ``in light of
Ashland's efforts to mitigate the spill's impact and the fact that
the company quickly accepted responsibility for the incident,''
said Ashland spokesman Roger Schrum.
   Ashland has voluntarily paid more than $11.4 million for
clean-up costs associated with the spill and to reimburse claims
from individuals, businesses and government agencies, Schrum said.
   ``We think such actions impair rather than promote environmental
compliance,'' he said.
   Ashland disassembled a 48-year-old oil storage tank at Whiskey
Island, Ohio, in 1986 and then reassembled it at its Jefferson
terminal. It was placed in service in August 1987 and then
collapsed four months later, the indictment said.
   In May, investigators for the Battelle Memorial Institute, an
independent research group that studied the accident, said a
dime-size flaw in the tank's brittle steel walls caused the
collapse. Aggravating the condition were the relative weakness of
the World War II-era steel, pressure from the diesel fuel and cold
weather.
   Johnson said the federal government still must determine if any
Ashland employees or officials violated the law.
   In a separate civil action in July, the U.S. Justice Department
filed a proposed consent decree requiring Ashland the oil company
to complete the cleanup of the spill and to reimburse the
government $680,000 for emergency response work by federal agencies.
   Ashland has agreed to the decree's terms.

<HEAD>FAA Ordered To Review Rule Forcing Airline Pilots To Retire At 60</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court has ordered the Federal Aviation
Administration to review its decision requiring commercial airline
pilots to retire at age 60, officials said Thursday.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the FAA's decision
denying 28 pilots an exemption from the retirement rule, even
though they had passed health tests to establish their fitness to
fly.
   The court ordered the FAA to reconsider its decision to deny the
pilots' request for an exemption.
   The 28 pilots, from several major airlines including United and
Eastern, had appealed the FAA's ruling last year directly to the
appellate court, contending older pilots could be given medical and
psychological tests to determine if they're fit to fly big jets.
   They also argued that their years of experience in the cockpit
would enhance safety and compensate for undetected physical
problems. The pilots presented evidence that older pilots have
fewer accidents than younger, less experienced pilots, said Alan M.
Serwer, a Chicago attorney who represented the pilots.
   ``The `age 60 rule' may be worsening the effect of a current
shortage of commercial airline pilots,'' Serwer said Thurday. ``The
airlines have lowered their standards for employment, and they're
promoting young pilots very rapidly into slots being vacated in
fairly large numbers by captains who reach the age 60 cutoff.
   ``Certain crashes of the past few years might have been avoided
had the planes' young pilots had more experience with difficult
flying conditions or with the specific aircraft they were flying,''
Serwer contended.
   He declined to provide specific examples, but said ``the FAA
itself has expressed concern about the lack of experience in the
cockpit.''
   The appeals court ruling was issued Monday and disclosed
Thursday by Serwer.
   ``We have not seen the decision yet and until we do we're not
going to have any reaction or comment,'' said Fred Farrar, a
spokesman at FAA headquarters in Washington. Farrar also declined
to respond to any of Serwer's remarks.
   United Airlines, based in the Chicago area, also declined to
comment because it hadn't reviewed the ruling, said spokeswoman
Sara Dornacker.
   The FAA instituted the age 60 retirement rule in 1960 for all
pilots flying commercial airliners that carry more than 30
passengers, Serwer said. It doesn't apply to pilots flying commuter
airline jets or planes with fewer than 30 passengers or to flight
engineers, the third person in the cockpit on large airline flights.
   In their appeal, the pilots didn't challenge the retirement rule
directly, aiming instead at the FAA's decision to deny them an
exemption to the rule based on their ability to pass flight tests
and medical screening for heart disease, stroke and other potential
health hazards.
   In the appellate court decision, Judge Richard D. Cudahy wrote
that the FAA's consideration of the petition for exemption was
incomplete. The agency, he wrote, ``failed to set forth a
sufficient factual or legal basis for its rejection of the
petitioners' claim that the older pilots' edge in experience
offsets any undetected physical losses.''
   Serwer also contended the FAA's strict enforcement of the age 60
rule was arbitrary because the agency grants ``thousands of
exemptions'' to other restrictions, even granting exemptions to
some pilots diagnosed as chronic alcoholics.

<TEXT>
   The nation will have five times as many AIDS
cases in four years, with 365,000 cases by 1992, the Centers for
Disease Control predicted Thursday.
   As of this week, 72,766 AIDS cases have been reported to the
CDC, with 41,064 patients, or 56 percent, already dead.
   By the end of 1992, the number of cases will total 365,000, and
deaths will reach 263,000, or 72 percent of the predicted case
total, the CDC said.
   The predictions came in a report summarizing the CDC's latest
quarterly report on AIDS to the White House's Domestic Policy
Council. The CDC in 1986 issued its AIDS predictions for 1991,
which call for 270,000 cases by the end of that year.
   Actual AIDS reporting has run slightly higher than predicted;
the agency in 1986 predicted 15,800 cases in 1986 and 23,000 in
1987, while the actual totals were 17,100 and 25,200, respectively.
   ``We think they're very close,'' said Dr. Tim Dondero, a CDC
AIDS specialist. ``I think the message is that, at least for the
first couple of years, this ... method gives some pretty reliable
estimates.''
   In the report released Thursday, the Atlanta-based health agency
predicts 80,000 cases of AIDS in 1992 alone, with 66,000 deaths
that year. A total of 172,000 living AIDS patients will require
medical care in 1992, at a cost of anywhere from $5 billion to $13
billion, the CDC predicted.
   The CDC also reported that its current estimate of between 1
million and 1.5 million Americans currently infected with the virus
which causes AIDS is ``a reasonable working estimate,'' based on
mathematical analysis by experts convened by the CDC in April. The
estimate has been criticized in some quarters as possibly wrong,
but the CDC has continued to state that it remains the agency's
best guess.
   The report noted that the national infection estimate has
remained the same since it was devised in 1986. ``This does not
mean that no new infections have occurred,'' the CDC said. ``The
1986 estimate was based on preliminary data, and was probably too
high (at the time).''
   Findings from several specific surveys for AIDS infection rate
would tend to confirm the current estimate, the CDC said. The
nationwide infection rate, researchers believe, is approximately
0.4 percent to 0.6 percent. Recent tests among 18,809 hospital
patients and 65,960 Job Corps entrants found infection rates of 0.3
percent and 0.4 percent, respectively.
   The report noted that more than 420 different surveys for AIDS
infection will be conducted with federal funds in the coming months
in sexually-transmitted-disease clinics, TB centers, hospitals and
other sites in 23 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C.
   Additionally, government researchers hope to have results by the
end of this year on AIDS infection tests on students at 20
participating colleges.

   One day after Premier Andreas Papandreou
was pictured in Greek newspapers strolling hand-in-hand with his
girlfriend, the government announced he had plans to divorce his
American-born wife Margaret.
   Papandreou, 69, will end his marriage when he returns to Greece
after undergoing heart surgery in London, the government said
Thursday. Doctors say the surgery to replace a heart valve will
probably take place later this month.
   A government spokesman did not say whether the premier plans to
marry his 34-year-old girlfriend, airline stewardess Dimitra Liani,
who also is married.
   Asked about marriage plans, Ms. Liani was quoted as saying, ``If
a relationship progresses that is the natural outcome, but neither
the premier nor I has divorced.''
   Divorce proceedings are under way between Ms. Liani and her
husband, Alexis Kapopoulos, a 43-year-old architect who was
formerly a prominent member of Greece's pro-Maoist Revolutionary
Communist Party.

   Convicted bomber and Mormon documents
forger Mark Hofmann was in critical condition Thursday from an
apparent drug overdose, a hospital official said.
   Utah Health Sciences Center spokesman John Dwan said a medical
helicopter was rushed to Utah State Prison on Thursday afternoon
after Department of Corrections officials said they had a
critically ill inmate.
   Dwan said Hofmann was in ``critical and unstable condition and
comatose.''
   Hofmann also suffered ``minor to moderate burns'' on his right
forearm and chest, he said. He said the cause of the burns was not
immediately known, but they were not considered serious.
   Hofmann, 33, is serving a five years to life prison term
following his a January 1987 plea agreement. Hofmann admitted
killing two people with homemade pipe bombs on Oct. 15, 1985, to
cover up his secret career as a forger of Mormon and other
historical documents.
   Juan Benavidez, state Department of Corrections spokesman, said
officers were called to Hofmann's cell about 12:40 p.m. by his
cellmate, who could not wake him up for their noon meal.
   Benavidez said Hofmann had been prescribed a sleeping
medication, but he did not know what it was, or the dosage.

   U.S. and Soviet planes jointly studied Hurricane
Gilbert on Thursday, ending concern that the two nations were
competing for airspace over the storm as it moved off Mexico's
Yucatan Peninsula.
   ``After the confusion, we have a coordinated, international
effort to take a hard look at the insides of this very dangerous
storm,'' said Don Witten of the National Weather Service office in
suburban Coral Gables. ``That's the resolution.''
   A Soviet AN-12 took off from Cuba and made contact with American
pilots to work out a deal for probing Gilbert as it headed over the
Gulf of Mexico, Witten said.
   He said the Soviet plane was operating at 12,000 feet, an Air
Force plane was at 10,000 and a civilian aircraft from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the weather service's
parent agency, was at 5,000 feet.
   In the earlier confusion, forecasters at the National Hurricane
Center in the Coral Gables weather service office, believed the
Soviet Union had permission for exclusive use of much of the
airspace over Gilbert, and center Director Bob Sheets feared U.S.
planes might not be able to gather needed advisory information.
   ``We don't know if they got their permission from Mexico, but
that would be the logical place,'' Witten said.
   There is no higher international authority for arbitration when
two planes want to fly the same international airspace, said Roger
Myers of the Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta.
   Because of the Soviet flight, the Air Force plane withdrew from
the hurricane's eye sooner than planned, but it stayed in the area
to try to make radio contact with the Soviet plane, said Pentagon
spokesman Lt. Col. Jim Jannette.
   Contact was made, and the U.S. and Soviet flight crews
``negotiated proper vertical and horizontal separation limits so
that both their missions could continue,'' Jannette said.
   The planes were studying the meteorology of the storm. The Air
Force reconnaissance plane was also gleaning needed data for
hurricane warnings, such as Gilbert's barometric pressure and top
wind speeds, said forecaster Max Mayfield.
   Gilbert, the most intense hurricane of the century until it
weakened over Mexico on Wednesday, had maximum winds of 120 mph at
noon Thursday, and was about 410 miles southeast of Brownsville,
Texas.

   Thousands of people fleeing Hurricane Gilbert's
path Thursday might wonder at George Zamiar and his two colleagues:
They were headed toward the storm, steeling themselves for a flight
into the hurricane's eye.
   Zamiar, an oceanographer with Marion-based Horizon Marine Inc.,
will be measuring Gilbert's effect on ocean currents for oil
companies with offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Despite some jitters, Gilbert ``doesn't scare me at all'' after
flying into Florence, his first hurricane, last week, Zamiar said.
``I'm concerned, but this is what I want to do. I need the job.''
   ``It's a dangerous thing,'' he said. ``There's no doubt about
that. Everybody kind of looks at you with the `you must be crazy'
look.''
   Zamiar will joined on the mission by John Marwitz, an
atmospheric scientist at the University of Wyoming and ex-Marine
George Bershinsky, who compared flying in extreme weather to combat
missions in Vietnam.
   ``It's not that much different,'' Bershinsky said. ``You develop
an extreme degree of alertness before you go into this. I don't see
any major difficulties. We're keeping our options open, so if it
gets too rough we can get out.''
   The three men planned to converge at Addison County Airport in
Dallas to plot the course of the storm before taking off early
Friday morning in a twin-engine Beech Aircraft King Air.
   The specially equipped plane rented from the University of
Wyoming is large and sturdy enough to get through the hurricane,
called one of the strongest ever, Zamiar said.
   Water and lightning from Gilbert are a greater threat than the
hurricane's top winds of 175 mph, he said.
   ``I'm certainly not a believer in when your number's up ... I'm
a believer of that school that you have to watch out for yourself
all the time, or else you'll force your number to be up.''
   Zamiar will drop 25 probes, known as expendable current
profilers, to measure the voltage induced in the water as Gilbert
passes through the Earth's magnetic field.
   The probes will be dropped on a series of runs just before,
during and after the hurricane hits the Continental Shelf, where
the gulf floor suddenly plummets to far greater depths.
   A radio component will remain above the water and send data from
the probes, which drop to the bottom of the water and develop a
water current profile reflecting speed, temperature and direction.
   The information is useful for oil companies and other groups
building projects in the gulf that must withstand extreme weather.
The 1,000-mile trip is expected to take about three hours.
   The Air Force and National Oceanographic Atmospheric
Administration fly into hurricanes to gain atmospheric data, but
``as far as I know, we are the first private company to fly into a
hurricane for purposes of research,'' Zamiar said.

<HEAD>Judges Plan Videotape Experiment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Judicial Conference on Thursday
announced plans for some federal courts to videotape their
proceedings in an experiment that, if successful, could eliminate
court stenographers.
   The experiment is noteworthy because federal courts, unlike many
of their state counterparts, ban all electronic coverage of
courtroom proceedings.
   The Judicial Conference, a 28-judge board which sets policy for
the nation's federal courts, approved the two-year videotaping
experiment in a closed meeting Wednesday, spokesman David Sellers
said.
   The experiment, to be conducted in six trial courts and two
appeals courts, is patterned after a program already in place in
Kentucky state courts.
   The conference wants to find out whether whether videotapes
should replace written documents as official records of trial and
appellate court proceedings.
   During the experiment, videotaping will supplement a
stenographic record.
   Public access to the videotapes is ``something that has not been
determined yet,'' Sellers said.
   The experiment will be monitored by a committee led by U.S.
District Judge Richard M. Bilby of Tucson, Ariz.
   Sellers said no final decision had been made on which courts
will use the videotapes, but he said federal trial judges in
Philadelphia have expressed interest. Participation of a federal
trial court in Arizona was possible because of Judge Bilby's role,
Sellers said.
   The judicial conference also reported that it is asking Congress
to create 73 new judgeships to eliminate backlogs and ease
workloads. But Sellers said, ``The realities are that nothing will
happen during an election year.''
   The last increase in the judicial workforce was in 1984 when
Congress authorized creation of 86 judgeships.
   The conference is seeking 14 new appeals court judges and 59
trial judges, but 22 of the trial judgeships would last only five
years.
   The conference in 1986 sought 56 additional trial court judges
and 13 appeals court judges _ a proposal that went nowhere in
Congress.
   There currently are 158 appeals court judges and 548 trial
judges.
   Sellers said the Judicial Conference also approved spending
$70,000 to $90,000 on closed-circuit television cameras to monitor
``high risk'' trials.
   He said stationary cameras capable of scanning a courtroom will
be installed in 10 or 12 major cities. The cameras will provide a
video monitor feed to a marshal's office.
   The U.S. Marshals Service proposed the security measure.

   Democratic Party leaders who once
dismissed Patrick Kennedy as too young and inexperienced to be
state representative said Thursday they were just being loyal to
the incumbent he defeated.
   ``I don't think anybody was against Kennedy,'' said House
Majority Leader Thomas A. Lamb, a Democrat from West Warwick. ``I
think the leadership was certainly in favor of Jack Skeffington. We
just think the world of Jack.''
   Lamb said Kennedy won't get the cold shoulder from his fellow
legislators, but said he still has an uphill battle to win their
respect.
   ``I think that he has to come to the House and he has to prove
himself,'' Lamb said. ``I hope that now they will have a
representative from the 9th District who will represent that
district well. The people will decide if he's doing a good job.''
   Skeffington, a five-term incumbent, assembled a powerful array
of General Assembly and party leaders to endorse him against the
21-year-old Kennedy, a Providence College junior and son of
Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.
   But Kennedy, making his first foray onto the political scene
where his famous family has long been prominent, handily defeated
Skeffington, 50, a funeral director in the 9th Representative
District, located in the heavily Irish and Italian neighborhood of
Mount Pleasant.
   Kennedy, who received 1,324 votes or 57 percent, to
Skeffington's 1,009 votes, or 43 percent, automaticaly wins the
office because there is no Republican opposition in November.
   House Speaker Joseph DeAngelis, a Democrat from Smithfield, said
he tried to talk Kennedy out of running last June because ``we felt
loyal towards Jack and we were going to do everything we could to
help Jack face a stiff primary.''
   But DeAngelis predicted that when the Legislature opens in
January there won't be ``animosity or resentment'' toward young
Kennedy.
   During the campaign, Skeffington rattled off a list of
supporters, including Secretary of State Kathleen Connell,
Providence Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr. and Lt. Gov. Richard Licht.
But Licht and Ms. Connell said they supported Skeffington because
he was endorsed by the party.
   ``It was a classic story of a young man taking on a veteran, and
in this instance, the energy and the excitement that Kennedy
brought to the contest won,'' Ms. Connell said.
   Skeffington blamed his defeat on the fanfare over the Kennedy
name and the campaign waged on Kennedy's behalf by numerous family
members, including Kennedy's father; his cousin, Massachusetts Rep.
Joseph Kennedy, and cousin John Kennedy Jr., the son of the late
president.
   In other results of Wednesday's Democratic primary, Rep. Fernand
J. St Germain, the House Banking Committee chairman who has served
14 terms, narrowly survived a challenge from Scott Wolf, a
political consultant making his first try for office. St Germain
got 55 percent of the vote.
   State and national Republican officials said they were
optimistic about their candidate Ronald K. Machtley's prospects
against St Germain in November. ``We'll throw everything we can in
it,'' said Rich Galen, spokesman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee in Washington. ``He is at the top of the
list of vulnerable Democrats.''
   And businessman Bruce G. Sundlun won the right to oppose
Republican Gov. Edward D. DiPrete in November.

   ``Duke Ellington's Sophisticated Ladies'' will
become the first American-Soviet co-production of a Broadway
musical, officials announced Thursday.
   The music and dance revue of songs by the late Duke Ellington
opened on Broadway in 1981. A new, $5 million production opens Oct.
1 in Moscow for two weeks, and then will tour.
   ``Ellington's music is very popularand very familiar to our
audiences,'' Eugene Tomach, director of the Soyuzteatr organization
in Moscow, said at a news conference.
   Duke Ellington led his band on a Soviet tour in the early 1970s.
   Mercer Ellington, who now leads the Ellington Band, helped
choose 16 Soviet musicians for the show's 20-piece orchestra.
American Frank Owens will conduct and play piano. Trumpeter Jon
Faddis and saxophonist Norris Turney, who played in his band before
Duke Ellington's death in 1974, also will be in the show's band.
   The cast will include tap dancers Hinton Battle and Gregg Burge
from the original Broadway cast and Donna Wood, a former dancer in
the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.
   One Soviet dancer is being trained to be in the 19-member cast.
   The Americans provide cast, director, choreographer, staff and
crew. A Soviet fashion designer will create costumes. Sets will be
designed by a Paris-based artist and constructed in Tbilisi in the
Soviet Union.
   After Moscow, the show will perform in Leningrad and Tbilisi,
then Paris, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Australia, New Zealand,
Singapore, Hong Kong and, in 1990, San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Washington, New York and London.

<TEXT>
   A Senate panel on Thursday voted to seize a
development site adjacent to the Manassas National Battlefield Park
in suburban Virginia, rejecting a compromise under which only part
of the parcel would be acquired.
   The Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted 11-8 to approve
a measure that would authorize Congress to acquire the 542-acre
William Center Development tract, close two heavily-traveled
commuter routes through the Civil War battlefield and pay up to $30
million to build new roads around the park.
   The measure, introduced by Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., is
identical to a bill that passed the House last month.
   It prevailed over a compromise measure by Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., that would have acquired just 80 acres of the tract. Warner
said his proposal would preserve the most important historical
aspects of the site at a lower cost.
   However, Bumpers maintained the entire tract was historically
significant.
   ``If we don't act to preserve that property, you can go down
there three weeks from now, and it will be gone, for all intents
and purposes,'' Bumpers said. ``It'll be a shopping mall.''
   Committe chairman Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., said he hoped
the bill would reach the Senate floor by next week. President
Reagan has threatened to veto any legislation similar to the
Bumpers bill.
   Developer John T. Hazel is planning to build a 1.2 million
square-foot shopping mall, 1.7 million square feet of office space,
and 560 homes adjacent to the 4,200-acre park.
   Historians claim the development would ruin the historic
integrity of the still-rustic ground on which the First and Second
Battles of Manassas were fought.
   In addition, the development site includes a hill from which
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee commanded his troops in Second
Manassas. Historians also claim that Union and Confederate dead lie
in unmarked graves scattered throughout the development area.

   The House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee approved legislation Thursday that would extend the U.S.
territorial limit to 12 nautical miles, the first change since 1793
when President Thomas Jefferson declared a three-mile protection
zone along the U.S. coast.
   The committee also approved legislation that would require that
foreign fishing vessels stow their gear when passing through the
200-mile U.S. economic zone and carry transponders so satellites
could track their location.
   Those proposals were attached to a new U.S.-Soviet fishing
treaty and were sought by Washington state lawmakers after seven
Japanese trawlers were videotaped fishing in American waters off
Alaska in January.
   Along with the change in the territorial limit, the measure also
includes an expansion of the so-called U.S. contiguous zone from 12
nautical miles to 24 nautical miles.
   The measure was approved on a voice vote.
   Rep. Mike Lowry, D-Wash., sponsor of the bill, said the
expansion of the territorial limit will allow the United States to
exercise complete control over a broader area and was essential for
national security reasons.
   The new limit will force foreign intelligence vessels to stay
further offshore, said Lowry.
   ``By moving our territorial sea from three miles to 12 miles,
the ability of Soviet ships to monitor and detect the movement of
U.S. submarines is lessened,'' said Lowry.
   The expansion of the contiguous zone will allow the United
States to enforce such things as its customs laws and pollution
regulations over a broader area, said Lowry.
   Lowry said the expansion would ``enhance our nation's ability to
intercept and board vessels which may be carrying contraband or
drugs off our coast.''
   ``With a 24-mile contiguous zone, the Coast Guard would be able
to board a foreign-flag vessel out to 24 miles, without seeking the
consent of the foreign flag nation. This would clearly enhance our
nation's drug enforcement authority,'' he said.
   Lowry said that both zones would be ``consistent with customary
international law'' and that the Reagan Administration was
considering such changes through an executive order.
   The new requirements for foreign fishing vessel passing through
the U.S. economic zone were approved just weeks after reports in
the Japanese press of a organized black market in Japan for fish
caught illegally in American waters.
   American fishermen estimate that Japanese trawlers have caught
illegally more than 100,000 tons of fish worth an estimated $250
million off Alaska since the first of the year.
   Rep. Don Bonker, D-Wash., said present law allows the Coast
Guard to take action against foreign trawlers only if they are
caught illegally fishing in U.S. waters.
   ``Many of these vessels are alerted to the presence of the Coast
Guard and haul up their nets before they are discovered,'' said
Bonker.

   Three men accused of murdering a U.S. drug
agent will have bloodstained hands forever, haunted by their guilt
like Shakespeare's Macbeth, a prosecutor told jurors Thursday.
   In the culmination of an eight-week trial, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Jimmy Gurule began his closing argument with a quotation
from the play, declaring: ``Will all great Neptune's ocean wash
this blood clean from my hand?''
   The defendants are charged with the slayings of Enrique Camarena
and his associate, Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   In a hushed courtroom, Gurule methodically laid out the case the
government has made in eight weeks of testimony against Raul Lopez
Alvarez, 28, and Rene Verdugo Urquidez, 36, both charged with
murder; and Jesus Felix Gutierrez, 38, charged as an accessory
after the fact.
   Felix is accused of helping Mexican drug kingpin Rafael Caro
Quintero flee to Costa Rica after Camarena and Zavala were killed.
   ``It is as a result of their participation whether direct or
indirect ... that their hands remain stained with the blood of
these two individuals,'' the prosecutor said.
   He spoke of Camarena as ``a hero whose only fault was that he
did his job too well.''
   ``He paid the ultimate price,'' said Gurule. ``He gave his life
for his job, for his country. He paid the price in the most savage,
barbaric, unbelievable manner. Beaten and beaten and beaten until
his life slowly slipped away, drained from his body.''
   Caro, who is jailed in Mexico, has been portrayed as the
mastermind behind Camarena's torture murder. Camarena was abducted
outside the U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara on Feb. 7, 1985. The
bodies of him and Zavala were found a few weeks later, buried on a
remote ranch.
   Gurule suggested to jurors that Caro marked Camarena for death
after a Drug Enforcement Administration raid on one of Caro's
marijuana plantations cost the drug baron $55 million and a second
raid netted 10,000 pounds of marijuana worth up to $5 billion.
   ``He has to blame somebody. DEA is responsible for these
losses,'' said Gurule. ``Somebody had to pay, and in this case it
was DEA agent Enrique Camarena.''
   With little physical evidence in the case, Gurule used charts to
outline circumstantial proof that the defendants were connected to
the deaths, noting evidence, for example, that put one defendant
near the scene of Camerena's abduction.
   Attorneys for the three defendants have contended they had no
role in the killings. If they discussed it with others, they said,
it was only because they read about it in the newspapers.
   Key pieces of evidence in the case were two tapes _ an audio
recording of Camarena being tortured and a videotape of Lopez
describing the Camarena killing to an undercover DEA agent who
posed as a drug dealer.
   Gurule dwelled on the brutal nature of the killings, describing
Camarena's crushed skull and Zavala's fractured ribs.
   ``It was as if someone was jumping up and down on his (Zavala's)
chest and crushed his chest cavity into his lungs,'' he said of
Zavala.

<HEAD>Engine Failure Ruled Out As Prime Cause Of Delta Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal investigators Thursday ruled out
engine failure as the primary cause of the crash of a Delta Air
Lines jet last month, saying there was no evidence the engines
suffered a mechanical breakdown prior to impact.
   The Aug. 31 crash as the Boeing 727 was attempting to take off
from the Dallas-Fort Worth airport killed 14 of the 108 people
aboard. The three pilots survived, but none was able to shed light
on the cause of the crash in initial interviews.
   Early speculation on the cause of the accident centered on the
plane's three engines because witnesses saw flames coming from an
engine and one of the pilots was heard on the cockpit recorder to
refer to ``engine failure'' shortly before the crash.
   But the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday a
detailed examination of the three Pratt & Whitney JT8D engines at
the company's facilities in Connecticut ``indicated there was no
evidence of pre-impact failure.''
   ``There was evidence that all engines were running as commanded
and capable of producing full power at the time of impact,'' the
NTSB said in a brief statement.
   The findings also seemed to rule out the possibility that an
object or bird was sucked into an engine since that would have been
evident when the engines were disassembled.
   NTSB spokesman Mike Benson said the findings do not necessarily
rule out a compressor stall or series of stalls that could have
been caused by a disruption of air flow through the engine as a
result of other problems. Such a disruption could result from the
aircraft having an unusual angle.
   But the NTSB said there was only slight rotational damage found
in one of the three engines and that was in an area of heavy damage
due to the crash. Generally, serious compressor stalls or a series
of stalls leave evidence of damage, but not always, according to
aviation experts.
   According to investigators, the cockpit voice recorder tape from
Delta Flight 1141 includes at least five noises that could be
engine compressor stalls, but all of them occur after the plane
already was having serious problems remaining aloft.
   The NTSB's statement did not address the continuing questions of
what might have caused an engine compressor stall _ if one or more
occurred _ or why the aircraft failed to climb after reaching
adequate liftoff speed.
   Investigators have focused on whether the plane had the proper
wing flap setting. For takeoff, the flaps at the trailing edge of
the wings should have been extended to 15 degrees to gain proper
lift.
   The cockpit recorder includes an acknowledgement by co-pilot
Carey W. Kirkland that the flaps had been set for proper takeoff
and it shows no evidence of an alarm going off that should have
warned of an improper setting.
   But investigators found the flap control level in the retracted
position. The position of the jack screws on the wings also
indicated the flaps were retracted. Kirkland has told investigators
he does not remember anything about the flight after the plane
pushed back from the gate.
   A two-hour interview earlier this week of the pilot, Capt. Larry
Davis, who was at the controls durign the takeoff, shed little
light on what may have caused the crash, investigators said.
   Davis said he recalls one of the other pilots stating the flaps
were properly extended, but doesn't recall checking the flap
indicators to verify if they indeed had been set.
   He said he heard two ``loud bangs or explosions'' seconds after
liftoff and that the plane began to roll, according to Lee
Dickinson, the NTSB board member overseeing the investigation.
Dickinson quoted Davis as saying he previously had experienced
engine compressor stalls ``but nothing like this.''

   The stunning reversal of Delaware's
Democratic Senate primary ended Thursday as Samuel S. Beard, who
had already begun campaigning as his party's nominee, conceded
defeat to Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo.
   Beard, who appeared to have won Saturday's primary by nearly
3,000 votes, pledged his support of Woo at a news conference
shortly after the recount gave Woo a 71-vote victory, 20,225 to
20,154.
   Woo faces Republican incumbent William V. Roth Jr., who is
seeking a fourth term and did not have primary opposition.
   ``I am happy to be here today to concede to S.B.,'' Beard said,
pledging his support to the party and Woo's campaign.
   ``Together, we're going to go out and beat Bill Roth,'' said
Beard, who was named an honorary co-chairman of the campaign.
Explaining how he planned to go out and thank the voters, Beard's
voice cracked and his eyes filled with tears.
   ``Saturday night, I know that I gave the most upbeat concession
speech in the history of American politics,'' said Beard, a
millionaire civic activist.
   Woo joked that he had lived up to his nickname of ``Landslide
Woo,'' noting that when he was elected lieutenant governor four
years ago, he won by less than 500 votes in a race that also
required a recount.
   ``Sam, no one knows more than I the emotional roller coaster
your family has been through in the past few days,'' Woo said.
   He called Beard a ``formidable opponent,'' adding he would be
``even more formidable as an ally.''
   Both requested the recount Monday after a computer keypunch
operator mistakenly gave Beard 2,800 votes too many. Beard thought
he had won with 22,418 votes to Woo's 19,624.
   The 2,800-vote error occurred in a voting district of New Castle
County, where about 280 Democrats are registered. Beard received 28
votes in the district, but the votes were recorded as 2,828 in the
computer at the county's department of elections, according to Paul
T. Hart, county elections director.
   Woo, a 51-year-old physics professor at the University of
Delaware, was a political newcomer when elected lieutenant govenor
four years ago. He became a champion of Asian-Americans nationwide.
   Beard, a 49-year-old activist who inherited his wealth, had the
backing of party loyalists and labor. Beard has served as chairman
for job creation commissions under the past four presidents.

<HEAD>Lawyers Say Alcoholism Impaired Deaver's Memory</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates thruout with more testimony</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers trying to minimize the perjury
sentence Michael K. Deaver faces contended Thursday that alcoholism
impaired the former presidential aide's memory during sworn
testimony about his lobbying.
   Defense lawyer Randall J. Turk said there was medical evidence
that ``at all times relevant to this case'' Deaver was an alcoholic
and that the disease impaired his memory.
   It clouded Deaver's memory both at the time of the lobbying
contacts and when he was later questioned about them under oath by
a grand jury and a House subcommittee, Turk said.
   The former deputy White House chief of staff and close friend of
President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, faces a possible five-year
term and a $6,800 fine for each of three perjury convictions.
   Deaver was found guilty late last year of lying by saying he
couldn't recall certain contacts with former Reagan administration
officials for high-paying lobbying clients.
   Sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 23. The evidence was offered
to give ``the court understanding of the offense behavior for which
Mr. Deaver was convicted,'' Turk said. Medical testimony about
Deaver's condition was not offered during the trial because the
defense rested without calling any witnesses.
   More testimony was scheduled on Friday.
   Turk said doctors would testify that Deaver's memory might have
been impaired because he took a Valium tablet before questioning in
May 1986 by the House Energy and Commerce investigations
subcommittee. The panel and a grand jury investigated Deaver's
lobbying for possible ethics-law violations.
   Deaver's willingness earlier that year to pose holding a
telephone in a rented limousine near the U.S. Capitol for a Time
magazine cover photo for a story about his lobbying shows how
alcohol had impaired his judgment, Turk said.
   The cover headline said: ``Who's this man calling? Influence
peddling in Washington.''
   ``His trust of Time magazine staggers the mind,'' Turk said,
noting that Deaver would not have allowed Reagan to expose himself
to the press that way.
   Dr. William Argy testified Deaver had been drinking up to a
fifth of Scotch whisky a day before his first treatment for
alcoholism in June 1985 at Georgetown University Hospital. The
alcohol detoxification occurred several weeks after Deaver left the
White House staff.
   Deaver remained sober for five months but began drinking in
December 1985 and his daily consumption had reached as much as a
pint of vodka or a bottle of wine before his second hospitalization
in October 1986, Argy said.
   Deaver's wife, Carolyn, told the doctor her husband consumed
``bottles and bottles of wine'' the weekend before the first
treatment in 1985 _ an episode that confirmed her belief he had a
drinking problem, Argy testified.
   A Roman Catholic priest who operates an alcoholism treatment
center in Havre de Grace, Md., testified that the former
presidential aide complained of blackouts when he was admitted for
a month's stay in 1986 following his second hospitalization.
   But on cross-examination by prosecutors, the Rev. Joseph Martin
noted that treatment records showed Deaver ``enjoyed a nightly game
of Trivial Pursuits'' _ a board game that tests players' memory on
a broad range of subjects.
   The priest praised Deaver's successful two-year fight against
alcoholism, saying: ``I don't know if I could sit in the chair
where he is, facing what he is facing with the serenity and
equanimity'' that he has.
   ``He will weather what happens and he will continue going to AA
(Alcoholics Anonymous) until he dies,'' said the priest, the first
of several witnesses Deaver's lawyers planned to call during the
two-day proceeding.
   The defense is trying to convince U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson that alcoholism should be a mitigating factor in
determining Deaver's sentence.
   But independent counsel Whitney North Seymour Jr. argued that
Deaver's treatment records show ``nothing to support any finding
that his memory was impaired.''
   ``Mr. Deaver's ability to recall was absolutely functioning, it
was just that he decided to select what he wanted to recall,'' said
Seymour.
   Among other things, the former White House aide was convicted of
perjury when he told a grand jury he couldn't recall contacting
government officials such as then-Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole and others on behalf of private lobbying clients.
   The telephone contacts with Mrs. Dole and White House aide Roger
Porter occurred when Deaver was in the hospital ``while he was
going through acute alcohol withdrawal and while he was sedated''
with tranquilizers, Turk said.
   The doctors would say that Deaver's subsequent ``failure to
recall what he was doing at the time was quite understandable,'' he
added.
   But Seymour was able to show that the call to Mrs. Dole took
place only 45 minutes after Deaver had received his first
tranquilizer _ a 25-milligram dose of Librium.
   A telephone log produced at the trial showed Deaver spoke with
Mrs. Dole at 5 p.m. that day. Deaver took the Librium at 4:15 p.m.
and a 20-milligram dose of Valium at 5:45 p.m., said Argy, reading
from treatment records.
   Porter spoke with Deaver the next day, according to trial
testimony.

129 combat missions over North Vietnam. He left the active Air
Force in 1969 to become an airline pilot and joined the South
Dakota Air National Guard in 1970.
   Killey has received numerous awards and decorations, including
the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Meritorious Service Medal and
the Air Medal with 13 Oak Leaf Clusters.
   The one-star general will move from Rapid City, S.D., to
Washington to assume his new post. The four-year term does not
require Senate confirmation.

<HEAD>Clews Blames Commissioner For Problems</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carter Clews, a Federal Trade Commission
staffer fired and then re-hired in a dispute over political
activity, on Thursday blamed his troubles on Commissioner Andrew
Strenio.
   Clews was returned to the FTC payroll Wednesday, after
complaining that his resignation a week earlier had not been
submitted voluntarily. That departure came in the wake of a dispute
over letters the press aide sent out critical of Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   Clews was given a choice of resigning or being fired when
concerns were raised that the letters may have violated the Hatch
Act, which bans political activity by federal workers.
   But Commission General Counsel Robert Paul said Clews was
reinstated on Wednesday, at least until an investigation could be
completed into the facts surrounding the letters.
   Clews, meanwhile, issued a statement blaming Strenio, a
Democrat, for his problems.
   He charged that Strenio was engaged in a witch-hunt and was
trying to turn the commission into a ``covert arm of the Dukakis
campaign.
   ``If he had one iota of honor he would admit his culpability and
resign from office,'' Clews said.
   Strenio, in a statement issued by his office, said, ``Mr. Clews
claims that his dismissal or resignation from the Federal Trade
Commission somehow was caused by pressure from me. That is
incorrect.
   ``I did not propose, nor was I consulted about, dismissing Mr.
Clews or demanding his resignation. Indeed, I did not learn of his
departure until after he left.
   ``I am concerned about certain letters sent from the office of
public affairs and have requested an investigation. However, I am
reserving judgment on what action, if any, is appropriate until
after that investigation is completed,'' the statement said.
   Paul had reported that Clews was being returned to the payroll,
but would remain on administrative leave until the matter could be
settled.
   That prompted Clews to announce that he would not accept the
pay, instead saying he would divide the money among charities until
the matter can be settled.
   Commission Chairman Daniel Oliver and the other commission
members will likely have to make a final decision on the case.

   Schoolgirls who survived a bloody bus
hijacking sang hymns Thursday at a Mass celebrated by Pope John
Paul II but still felt the terror from the night before, when
police stormed the bus in a hail of bullets.
   One survivor said the hijackers, opposed to the military
government, sang and prayed with the 71 hostages before shooting at
the captives and lobbing grenades when police moved in to end the
27-hour ordeal on Wednesday night.
   Three hijackers and a 14-year-old girl were killed immediately.
On Thursday, a second passenger died of a bullet wound to the head
and the fourth hijacker died, the South African Broadcasting Corp.
said.
   Officials said 20 people were injured by bullets and by shrapnel
from the hijackers' grenades.
   Some of the hostages said they saw the hijackers setting up some
type of explosive device.
   The independent South African Press Association, quoting
``well-placed sources who watched the saga at close range'' said a
explosive device, to be triggered electronically, was found fixed
to the door of the bus.
   The government, which earlier denied South African forces were
invited to help end the hijacking, said South African police and
Lesotho soldiers assaulted the bus after the gunmen ordered the
driver to crash into the grounds of the British High Commission, or
embassy.
   Vitilina Quoaoho, 18, said the hijackers ``told us to lay under
the chairs and they ordered the driver to pass through the locked
gate'' of the embassy.
   ``We saw a big light (a flare fired by police) and then the
soldiers started shooting at the bus and the men (the hijackers)
were shooting at us,'' she said.
   ``We were very frightened. We are still frightened,'' she said,
with her friends echoing her words. As they spoke, men and women,
singing hymns to the beat of drum, walked by to take communion
during a brief, sunny moment in a Mass that had been punctuated by
thunder, rain and cold winds.
   The schoolgirls and several nuns who were aboard the bus were
among a crowd of about 15,000 who gathered at the Maseru racecourse
to see the pope beatify a French missionary who worked in Lesotho
until his death in 1914.
   Four of the girls, wearing plastic bags as rainhats and blue
uniforms from Pope John XXII High School, said that during the
hijacking police appeared ready several times to fire at the bus
during the journey to Maseru from the hijack point at Quacha's Neck.
   ``The men (the hijackers) prevented them, saying, `If you shoot
you will be shooting your own people,' '' said one of the girls.
   One unanswered question was why the hijackers suddenly tried to
force the bus into the British embassy compound.
   It happened less than a half hour after the pope's motorcade,
with police escort, had driven through the capital. He arrived by
road from South Africa, where his plane was diverted due to bad
weather in Maseru.
   Monica Morori, 36, who injured her feet jumping from the bus's
shattered windows during the shootout, said the hijackers were
joining passengers in singing and praying.
   Two of the hijackers were in their late teens and two were grown
men.
   After the Mass, the pope rode through the capital's main street
to the Queen Elizabeth II hospital, where he gave medals and
crucifixes to some of the injured, including children and two nuns.
   The pope urged his followers at Thursday's youth rally to
``renounce every form of violence and hatred.''
   ``The increase of violence in the world can never be halted by
responding with more of the same,'' he said.
   In an apparent criticism of some militants, including activists
who contend passive resistance alone cannot overcome South Africa's
system of racial segregation, John Paul said: ``There could be
nothing further from the truth. There is nothing passive about
non-violence.''
   The pope commented Thursday on the bus hijacking, remarking, ``I
am saddened to learn that others on their way to join me on this
pilgrimage have been victims of a hijack that has caused such
anguish and ended in bloodshed.'' One of the nuns he visited,
Sister Florina Nyogar, who had a bruised face, later told a
reporter how she felt during the shooting.
   ``We saw that it was our end, and we accepted to die,'' she said.
   She said reports from the government that the hijackers refused
to accept food for the hostages were inaccurate.
   ``We didn't feel like eating or drinking, we only felt like
praying,'' she said.
   Several hostages said the hijackers, who brandished a
Soviet-designed AK-47 automatic rifle, pistols and hand grenades,
claimed to be members of the Lesotho Liberation Army, a dissident
group that for years was based in South Africa but staged few
operations.
   Lesotho's ruling military council also blamed the dissident
group for the hijacking. The group's political commissar, Matladi
Sehlabaka, told The Star newspaper of Johannesburg that his
organization was not responsible.
   ``We could not have undertaken such an operation because we are
on talking terms with the Lesotho regime,'' Sehlabaka said.
   The hijackers reportedly demanded an end to military rule and
asked for a meeting with the pope and King Moshoeshoe II.
   The organization was also opposed to the leftist government of
the late Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan, who was ousted by the
current military council in a bloodless coup in January 1986.

   Hungary has agreed to renew full
diplomatic ties with Israel after a 21-year-old break, Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir said upon his return from Budapest Thursday.
   He suggested others in the Soviet bloc may follow suit.
   Shamir also said the Soviet Union has diverged from its
staunchly pro-Arab position in the Middle East conflict and was
``looking for solutions that would take (Israel's) needs into
consideration as well.''
   The statement marked a turnabout for the hardline Israeli
leader, who has accused Moscow of scheming to trap Israel by
pushing for an international Middle East peace conference. Shamir
opposes such a conference, and Israeli officials have said that
even if one was convened, Moscow could not take part until it
renewed diplomatic relations.
   Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, met in Budapest with
Prime Minister Karoly Grosz and other leaders. His two-day private
visit was the first to Hungary by an Israeli premier.
   Before leaving, Shamir held an emotional meeting with Hungarian
Jews and pledged ``very close contacts'' with members of Central
Europe's largest Jewish community.
   Shamir told reporters upon arriving in Israel, ``The Hungarian
prime minister concluded that we are approaching normal relations
at a very fast pace.''
   He said no timetable was set for restoring ties but that ``we
are heading for positive developments in the near future.''
   Hungary and all other Soviet bloc nations except Romania cut
diplomatic ties with Israel after it captured lands of the bloc's
Arab allies in the 1967 Middle East war. For years, Israel has
worked quietly to restore the links.
   Shamir said Grosz told him the issue of ties with Israel
frequently came up in his talks with other East European officials,
including Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Shamir suggested that other East European nations may upgrade
their ties with Israel, saying in response to a reporter's
question, ``You should not be suprised if there will be news.''
   Israeli officials said Budapest could not have acted without
Soviet approval and that the step appeared to signal a new stage in
the warming of relations with the Soviet bloc.
   This year the Soviet Union met a key Israeli demand in
permitting a growing number of Jews to leave the country.
Emigration figures in August reached an eight-year monthly high,
with 1,864 Jews allowed to leave. Moscow also has begun allowing
Soviet Jews to visit relatives in Israel.
   The Kremlin has exchanged consular delegations with Israel and a
Soviet chamber orchestra now is touring Israel as part of improved
cultural links between the two countries.
   A year ago, Hungary followed Poland in setting up an interest
section in Tel Aviv, establishing the lowest possible level of
diplomatic relations.
   Shamir said Grosz briefed him on Soviet positions on the Mideast
and other issues.
   In Hungary, official reports made no reference to any planned
restoration of diplomatic ties between Israel and Hungary.
   Hungary's official news agency MTI said the two leaders reviewed
bilateral ties ``and possibilities for the further development of
contacts.''
   MTI quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Laszlo Kovacs as saying one
reason for ``increasingly higher level contact'' with Israel was
the desire to promote Middle East peace.
   Israel promised to assist Hungary in economic and industrial
development, Israel radio said.
   Inflation in Hungary reached 18 percent this year, and the
country has a foreign debt of $18 billion.
   Hungary's Jewish community numbers about 80,000, and about
240,000 Jews of Hungarian origin live in Israel.

   Peace crusader Abie Nathan landed in
Israel Thursday after meeting illegally with PLO chief Yasser
Arafat in Tunis, and authorities greeted him with a police summons.
   Nathan, 61, was ordered to report to police for questioning
Friday for violating a law banning contacts with PLO officials. The
activist insisted the trip had the blessing of the Israeli army.
   ``Come to see me tomorrow if I'm in prison,'' Nathan told dozens
of reporters as he arrived at Ben Gurion International Airport near
Tel Aviv.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, troops shot and
wounded nine Palestinians during clashes, Arab doctors said. The
army said troops fatally shot an 11-year-old Arab boy overnight
after a patrol was attacked by a firebomb in Gaza City.
   The death brought to 266 the number of Palestinians killed since
the uprising against Israeli occupation began Dec. 8. Six Israelis
also have died.
   Nathan said he did not carry a message from Arafat to Israeli
leaders but would request meetings with Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres to brief them on the
session with the PLO chief in Tunis this week.
   Shamir accused Nathan of violating Israeli law, and a Foreign
Ministry official reacted sarcastically to Nathan's remark, saying
such a meeting ``would have to be done in jail.''
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also accused
Nathan of helping Arafat ``in his public relations campaign.''
   He apparently was referring to a Wednesday news conference in
Strasbourg, France, during which the PLO leader surprised his
audience by wishing Israelis a peaceful New Year, repeatedly using
the Hebrew phrase ``Shana Tova.'' The Jewish New Year began Sunday.
   Nathan said he urged Arafat to make the gesture, but he said the
PLO chief's willingness to comply was a symbol for his readiness to
recognize and negotiate with Israel.
   ``Who would ever have dreamed that anyone could convince Arafat
to say `Shana Tova'?'' Nathan told reporters. ``It was my idea. I
told him how to say it.''
   Nathan also said he presented Arafat with the names and photos
of five Israeli soldiers missing in action and was given assurances
that the PLO would try to help bring about their release.
   Nathan said Israeli army officials provided the list after he
told them he would try to meet Arafat in Tunis.
   Deputy army spokesman Col. Raanan, responding to Nathan's claim,
said the names of missing soldiers are available to anyone who
asks. ``I don't think he got any special blessing from the army.''
   Nathan also presented Arafat with a peace plan calling for
mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO. The peace activist
said Arafat promised to study the proposal.
   During an address to socialist members of the European
Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday, Arafat said the PLO accepted
all U.N. resolutions, including 242 and 338, which recognize
Israel's right to exist.
   But Peres, speaking to reporters in London at the end of a
two-day visit, said the PLO was in a ``confused state,'' torn
between proponents of compromise with Israel and rejectionists who
still dreamed of the destruction of the Jewish state.
   Peres did not spell out whether Israel now agreed to talk to the
PLO and accept an independent Palestinian state. Israel has refused
to negotiate with the PLO, saying it is a terror organization.
   A 1986 Israeli law bans meetings with representatives of terror
groups, including the PLO, and Nathan could face up to three years
in prison for meeting with Arafat.
   In 1966, Nathan flew a private plane to Port Said, Egypt, in an
unsuccessful attempt to hold peace talks with Egyptian President
Gamal Abdel Nasser. At the time, Israel and Egypt were still
officially at war.

<HEAD>New Pollution Findings Could Reduce Anti-Pollution Burdens for
Many Cities</HEAD>

   Recent findings about auto pollution could
make it easier for many cities to meet federal clean air standards,
the head of the Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday.
   The findings could double the effectiveness of planned agency
regulations to control the volatility of gasoline and the recovery
of gasoline fumes.
   Only in the past year has the agency begun to study what is
called ``running loss,'' the evaporation of gasoline from the tank
and other fuel system components while the car is moving.
   Gasoline fumes react in sunlight with nitrogen oxides from all
fuel combustion to produce ozone, which is harmful to the lungs.
Ozone is the constituent of urban smog that makes the chest feel
tight.
   Proposed regulations _ discussed for years, and frequently
postponed for reworking _ had been calculated to reduce urban
gasoline emissions by 10 percent or 15 percent, EPA Administrator
Lee M. Thomas said at luncheon for reporters.
   A new calculation of running loss suggests the effectiveness of
the planned regulations ``could be as much as twice that,'' Thomas
said.
   This could mean cities close to compliance with federal clean
air standards will have an easier time meeting the requirements and
may not have to launch programs to inspect auto exhausts and
pollution control systems, he said.
   ``I mean the marginal cities where reductions in hydrocarbons of
zero to 25 percent'' would be required, Thomas said.
   Thomas said he could not say which close-to-compliance cities
might comply under the planned regulations, but those most favored
would be areas with peak concentrations ``in the 0.14 (parts per
million) range'' and below.
   The federal standard calls for limiting peak ozone to 0.12 parts
per million and limiting excursions above that to no more than one
hour per year.
   EPA's list of non-complying areas contains 68 urban and rural
areas, 38 of them with peaks of 0.14 ppm and below.
   Federal regulations have long governed how much unburned
gasoline could be emitted in exhaust and how much could be
evaporated while the car is stationary, but EPA has ignored
evaporation while running in the belief that the amounts escaping
vapor recovery systems were negligible.
   Gasoline volatility has risen throughout the 1980s, and greater
volatility brings increased emissions through evaporation.
   Exxon Corp. scientists revealed in May that their own and EPA
tests showed vapor recovery systems on cars were being overwhelmed
on hot days, releasing to the atmosphere perhaps 25 times as much
gasoline as was permitted in exhaust.
   The proposed regulations will remove most of this important and
previously unknown source of ozone.
   EPA scientists said at the time it was an important discovery
but they had not had a chance to calculate what the new findings
would mean for urban ozone pollution. Thomas' disclosure Thursday
was the first such assessment.
   Thomas said he planned to republish the regulations in final
form for public comment in plenty of time to adopt them before the
Reagan administration leaves office.

<TEXT>
   Firefighters at
Yellowstone National Park on Thursday began building ``water bars''
on hiking trails so the precipitation that has fallen on the park
this week would not erode the paths.
   The logs placed across hiking trails divert runoff from melting
snow, park officials said.
   As some 7,200 firefighters and 1,200 soldiers worked to take
advantage of continued good weather, Democratic presidential
candidate Michael Dukakis and the governors of Wyoming, Montana,
Colorado and Idaho got a firsthand look at the destruction wrought
by fires that have consumed about 1 million acres of the nation's
oldest park since July.
   ``I can't remember a year in my lifetime when the weather seemed
to be more important to us in many ways, the drought, the heat, and
now a massive hurricane bearing down on us are reminding us not
only of our mortality but of the importance of pulling together and
caring for each other,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis said he was ``awestruck by what's happened here.''
   About 9,000 firefighters, including soldiers brought in from
military bases in the West, have been tackling the fires at the 2.2
million-acre park. Crews received a break this week with lower
temperatures, rain and snow.
   ``This week is a lull in the battle, it's quiet and nothing is
really going on,'' said fire information officer Bob Valen at
Yellowstone.
   There was no such luck for firefighters in Montana, Oregon and
Idaho.
   Soldiers began relieving weary firefighters on the smoldering
Canyon Creek fire in west-central Montana, while afternoon winds
and higher temperatures kept crews busy on a blaze in Glacier
National Park.
   Forecasters, meanwhile, predicted another Canadian cold front
may hit Montana this weekend, bringing rain or even snow at higher
elevations.
   ``With just a little bit of luck, maybe we could get enough
(precipitation) to put the doggone fires out,'' said National
Weather Service meterologist Jack Poppe.
   Temperatures rose into the 80s Thursday on the 32,200-acre Red
Bench fire in Glacier Park, where nearly 1,000 firefighters were
trying to complete the final mile of fire line and prevent the
flames from escaping.
   The fire has destroyed 21 homes and numerous outbuildings,
killed one firefighter and injured up to a dozen others since
raging out of control Sept. 6.
   In Oregon, Willamette National Forest crews worked on a
4-day-old fire that grew to 6,350 acres overnight and put out so
much smoke firefighters sometimes couldn't find the fire, said U.S.
Forest Service spokesman Norm Hesseldahl.
   ``It was a pretty frustrating day,'' he said. ``One of the
fellows told me he was standing on the dam at Hills Creek Reservoir
and couldn't see the dam, the smoke was so thick.''
   Idaho still has about 300,000 acres of forest fires, and several
wilderness and forest areas have been closed to public entry until
the fire danger eases.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Henry C. Wallich, a governor of the Federal
Reserve Board from 1974 to 1986, died Thursday. He was 74.
   An announcement released by the Federal Reserve said he died at
George Washington University Medical Center following an extended
illness.
   Appointed by President Richard Nixon on March 8, 1974, Wallich
was regarded as the seven-member board's expert on international
economics. During the Carter and Reagan administrations, he was
considered an ally of then-Chairman Paul Volcker. Wallich resigned
Dec. 15, 1986, citing ill health.
   Under President Dwight Eisenhower, he served from 1958 to 1959
as an assistant to Treasury Secretary Robert B. Anderson and from
1959 to 1961 as a member of the President's Council of Economic
Advisers.
   Born June 10, 1914 in Berlin, Wallich was educated in Germany
and Oxford University in England and he earned a doctorate in
economics at Harvard University.
   During the 1930s, he was a securities analyst in New York City
and was in the export business in Argentina and Chile.
   From 1941 to 1951, he was on the staff of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York before becoming a professor of economics at Yale
University from 1951 to 1974. He took a leave of absence for his
appointments in the Eisenhower administration.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan's choice of Lauro F. Cavazos
of Texas to become the nation's next secretary of education was
approved Thursday by a Senate committee, clearing the way for
expected easy confirmation by the full Senate.
   ``I expect him to be confirmed unanimously,'' said Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas. ``I would be very surprised if anybody voted
against Larry.''
   The Labor and Human Resources Committee recommended unanimously
that the Senate confirm Cavazos, who would become the first
Hispanic ever to serve in a presidential cabinet. A Senate vote was
likely early next week, staff members said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the committee chairman, praised
Cavazos after the panel voted. He said the Texan would bring
``fresh leadership and a new dedication to excellence in education
_ and a less-confrontational approach to this all-important issue.''
   If confirmed, Cavazos, who has been president of Texas Tech
University in Lubbock since 1980, would succeed William J. Bennett
in the Cabinet post and would serve until the president elected in
November takes office in January.
   Gramm said he believed Cavazos would be retained in the Cabinet
if Vice President George Bush, the Republican presidential nominee,
wins the November election. If that is the case, said Gramm, the
Texan would ``clearly have an opportunity to have great impact on
every school child in America.''
   Cavazos told the Senate panel last week that he would push for
increased education spending and focus on meeting the educational
needs of all Americans.
   ``It is vital we have a Department of Education that speaks up
for every citizen in the area of education,'' he said.
   Reagan disclosed his selection of Cavazos on Aug. 9. Bennett had
announced May 9 that he would resign from the Cabinet in
mid-September. Bennett took office as education secretary in
February 1985, succeeding T.H. Bell, who had been in the Reagan's
original Cabinet and served from 1981 through 1984.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain fell Thursday on much of the central United States, and
Hurricane Gilbert sent clouds and showers to the central Gulf of
Mexico coast.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued into mid-afternoon from
Oklahoma across eastern South Dakota, from southwest Minnesota
across northwest Arkansas and eastern Florida.
   Rain from Hurricane Gilbert reached from Louisiana to the
Florida panhandle.
   Heavier rainfall Thursday included 1.75 inches at Kansas City,
Mo., nearly 1{ inches at Sioux Falls, S.D., nearly 1\ inches at
Oklahoma City and more than an inch at New Orleans.
   Hurricane warnings remained in effect along the lower Texas gulf
coast from Port O'Connor to Brownsville. A hurricane watch was
posted from Port O'Connor to Port Arthur.
   A frost warning was posted for northeast New York and much of
Vermont for Thursday night.
   The low temperature in the nation Thursday was 21 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged
from 51 degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 103 degrees at Palm
Springs, Calif.
   Orlando, Fla., reached 96 degrees, breaking a record for the
date set in 1987.
   The outlook for Friday called for rain with lower temperatures
in Montana, where rain will become snow in the mountains;
rainshowers and thunderstorms will extend from the southeast half
of Texas across the central Gulf of Mexico coast to the Florida
Panhandle, the upper Great Lakes, the lower Ohio Valley, western
Tennessee and western Alabama.
   Skies will be cloudy over the northern Plains and the northern
Pacific coast. Skies will be generally sunny over the remainder of
the nation.
   High temperatures will be in the 50s for northern Maine and
northeast Minnesota; in the 60s and 70s from southern Maine across
North Carolina, the Great Lakes, the Mississippi Valley and much of
the northern half of the plains, the Rocky Mountains, the Pacific
Northwest and the California coast.
   High temperatures across southern Texas will be in the mid to
upper 70s; in the 90s for the lower two-thirds of the Florida
peninsula and from northeast and southwest Texas; and near 105 in
the desert Southwest.

<HEAD>Board Association Panel Calls For Alternatives to Collective
Bargaining</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Local school boards should find supplements or
alternatives to collective bargaining with teacher unions to bring
about education reforms, a National School Boards Association panel
said Thursday.
   ``While most public school systems participate in collective
bargaining with their teacher organizations, the adversarial nature
of these discussions has worked against cooperation and candor in
some instances,'' the panel said in a 44-page report.
   The panel was convened last year by the association's
then-President Jonathan T. Howe, who is a local school board member
in Northbrook, Ill., ``to look into how we get into these
situations'' of strikes at the opening of school terms each
September.
   The report comes on the heels of Carnegie Foundation survey
released this week showing that teachers believe they have little
role in key classroom decisions and want more authority and
responsibility.
   Howe said he agreed with the foundation's conclusions that
teachers should have more to say about such things, but not through
collective bargaining by their unions.
   ``Collective bargaining today is what I call P-M-P _ power,
money and process,'' he said. ``These are the three items that
normally get discussed at the bargaining table. It is nearly
impossible to discuss working cooperatively for the benefit of
school children after hours of debate solely on pay scales,
benefits and length of contract.''
   Howe said union-heralded education reform efforts in Dade
County, Fla., and Rochester, N.Y., ``came about not through
collective bargaining but through a waiver of collective bargaining
to bring about change.''
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said Howe's conclusion that collective bargaining entails
only power, money and process contradicts examples of reforms cited
in the report in school systems in Dade County, Rochester, Toledo
and Pittsburgh.
   ``The idea that innovative education reform initiatives in
Rochester and Miami could have taken place without the strong
backing of local AFT affiliates or a strong contract is just plain
wrong,'' Shanker said.
   He called collective bargaining the best way for communicating
between teachers and school administrators because it ``insures
that whatever dialogue occurs is held on equal ground.''
   The association's report said the two major themes surfacing in
several recent calls for education reform are restructuring schools
and ``empowerment of teachers.''
   But it defines ``empowerment'' as sharing information _ not
power _ with teachers, designing instructional programs in
cooperation with them and assigning them a share of the
responsibility for fostering excellence.

   Three anti-apartheid leaders
taking refuge in the U.S. Consulate after escaping from detention
said Thursday they do not trust the government's promise not to
rearrest them.
   Colleagues of the activists, who had been detained without trial
for at least a year, said they may ask the United States to serve
as guarantor for an agreement that the three would remain free and
unrestricted if they leave their sanctuary.
   Firoz Cachalia, an associate of the three, said the government's
promises ``are not worth the paper they're written on.'' He said
the activists were likely to remain in the consulate until firm
guarantees could be obtained.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said Wednesday the activists
would not be arrested if they left the consulate. A spokesman for
Vlok, Brig. Leon Mellet, said the three were now ``normal, free
people'' and would have been released shortly if they had not
escaped.
   The activists have not indicated when or if they will leave the
consulate, on the 11th floor of a Johannesburg office building.
They have rejected proposals to leave the country in exchange for
freedom.
   The three said in a statement Thursday: ``It is clear that the
minister (Vlok) intends placing us under severe restrictions. We
consider bannings and house arrest just another form of detention.''
   ``The crucial question is what kind of freedom does the minister
envisage for us?'' they said. ``Is it the freedom he has imposed on
Albertina Sisulu and Raymond Suttner or is it the freedom which he
himself or any other Nationalist Party member enjoys?``
   Suttner, a white activist, was placed under severe restrictions
when he was released this month after 27 months in detention. Mrs.
Sisulu, wife of jailed African National Congress leader Walter
Sisulu, is barred from making public statements and from most
political activities.
   The banned ANC is the leading guerrilla organization fighting
white minority rule in South Africa.
   The escapees are Murphy Morobe, acting publicity secretary of
the banned United Democratic Front; Mohammed Valli Moosa, the
front's acting general secretary; and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of
the banned National Education Crisis Committee.
   Morobe, detained since July 1987, and Khanyile, detained since
December 1986, are black. Valli Moosa, arrested with Morobe, is
Indian.
   They slipped away from two police guards Tuesday while
undergoing physiotherapy at a hospital.
   The activists' lawyer, Krish Naidoo, said he had received no
official word from the government that the men were free. The
government said assurances to that effect were given to U.S.
officials.
   Prominent anti-apartheid leaders consulted with the trio
Thursday and Morobe was visited by his wife and two children.
   U.S. officials have said the activists will not be forced to
leave the consulate despite a worldwide U.S. policy of not formally
granting asylum in diplomatic offices.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods since June 1986, when the government declared a
state of emergency to control widespread black protests.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   Protesters armed with clubs and
firebombs battled riot police Thursday at an anti-government
demonstration, and at least 48 people were injured, reports said.
   The melee started when riot police stopped about 600 students
and dissidents from marching off the campus of A-ju University in
Suwon, 25 miles south of Seoul, the Korean news agency Yonhap
reported. It said four students were arrested.
   Protesters shouted slogans opposing a government ban on what
they called legal demonstrations when the Olympic Games open in
Seoul Saturday.
   Yonhap said police refrained from using tear gas because Suwon
is designated as a ``Peace Zone.'' Police and school authorities
declined to comment.
   Authorities have banned all street demonstrations in ``peace
zones'' in Seoul and other cities, which have Olympic venues and
related facilities.
   Yonhap said demonstrators organized the rally at the A-ju campus
to protest an earlier police action in which a student was
seriously injured after being hit by a tear gas canister Sept. 7
during an anti-Olympic, anti-government demonstration at a nearby
university campus.
   Protests during the past week have been small and attracted
little support, with the great majority of South Koreans and most
students ignoring demands the Olympics be shared with communist
North Korea to help promote reunification of the divided Korean
peninsula.

<TEXT>
   George Bush, taking aim at one of his
opponent's main bragging points, said Thursday that Michael
Dukakis' economic policies have hurt Massachusetts and would
``knock the foundations'' from under the national economy.
   He also renewed his public hope that Lt. Col. Oliver North, a
key figure in the Iran-Contra affair, be found innocent of the
federal charges he faces.
   Bush said Massachusetts has lost 26,000 jobs in the past five
years while Dukakis has been governor _ a contention at odds with
federal figures that show a big increase during the period though
jobs in manufacturing have decreased by about that number.
   And, in a comment two days before the opening of the summer
Olympic Games, he said Dukakis should be crowned the ``gold medal
winner in the tax-and-spend competition.''
   On economics, Bush quoted his Democratic presidential rival as
saying he wants ``to do for the nation what he has done for
Massachusetts.'' The vice president added, ``That slogan is
sounding more and more like a threat.''
   Winding up a two-day campaign drive in California, where the
presidential race is neck and neck, Bush delivered a speech before
San Francisco's Commonwealth Club, whose members include
businessmen, lawyers and politicians.
   ``Under my opponent, Massachusetts has lost _ lost _ 26,000 jobs
since 1983, more than any other state in the country,'' Bush said.
   Government figures indicate the state has gained more than
230,000 jobs in the past five years. The text of Bush's speech said
``manufacturing jobs,'' and aides said that was what the campaign
would stand by. Government figures do show a loss in manufacturing
jobs, more than made up for by increases in other areas.
   Bush said that under Dukakis, ``taxing and spending in
Massachusetts has increased more than in any other state,'' and
that the state has amassed a $7.4 billion dollar debt.
   Dukakis, responding to the Bush remarks while on an inspection
tour of five-damaged Yellowstone National Park, said:
   ``My state has more jobs than people to fill them. We're very
proud of what we've done. ... We've not only built a strong
economic future but we've balanced budgets 10 years in a row.''
   On a different subject, Bush was asked about North by a student
at a Concord, Calif., high school. Asked whether he would pardon
North, Bush said: ``The question is for me _ pardon imputes guilt,
and therefore I have refused to speculate on this because I want to
see this man have a fair trial. I hope he's found innocent. ...
   ``In my description anybody that shed his blood in Vietnam with
two or three purple hearts is a hero for that,'' Bush said. ``Now
did he make some mistakes? Maybe so. But you're not going to see me
picking on Ollie North.''
   At the same question-and-answer session, a girl needled him
about flubbing the date of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor,
and a boy asked if Bush didn't want to ``deck'' Dukakis for teasing
him on the same issue.
   Bush told the boy, ``When you make a mistake like that, I expect
somebody to jump on me.''
   And when the girl asked him ``When was Pearl Harbor?'' he joked
about being in Connecticut instead of California, teased her about
never having made a mistake in her life, then waxed serious.
   ``I remember because I fought for my country in war...and I hope
we'll never have another one,'' the former bomber pilot said.
   Later, aboard Air Force Two, Bush said he would study debate
tapes from President Reagan in preparation for his own encounters
with Dukakis ``because I think it's important ... to say what you
feel in your heart more than reel off some statistics.''
   Bush relaxed and sipped on a glass of wine as he told reporters
his goal in the debates is to ``project what I am, warts and all.''
   Responding to an account in a forthcoming book about President
Reagan that said some aides expressed serious doubts about the
president's mental ability to carry out his duties during the
Iran-Contra crisis, Bush said:
   ``I was there. I saw the president. This is so offensive to me.
It's so grossly unfair to a very successful president. It really
offends me.''
   Bush said Dukakis as governor has tried to raise taxes five
times, most recently this summer with a $180 million increase in
business taxes, sales taxes and personal income taxes.
   When taxpayers rebelled, Dukakis was forced to sign a repeal,
Bush said. ``This, by the way, is one of the `five tax cuts' that
he boasts about in his campaign _ gospel, gospel truth,'' Bush
said, calling the other four inconsequential.
   Bush said that under Dukakis, Massachusetts has had the second
fastest increase in state taxes per capita of all 50 states. ``When
it comes to increasing state spending, per capita, my opponent is
at the top of the list, leading (the) 50 states.
   Michael Boskin, a Stanford University professor who is a Bush
economic adviser, said the tax-increase ranking was based on an
increase in tax revenue during Dukakis' past five years.
   In general, that increase was caused by higher income, not
higher tax rates, he said.
   Bush also said that under Dukakis, Massachusetts has ranked 40th
in job growth and 45th in manufacturing job growth.

<HEAD>British Shooter Says IRA Member Died For Ignoring Warning To Stop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIBRALTAR (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of four British commandos who shot and
killed three unarmed IRA guerrillas in March told a coroner's
inquest Thursday that one of the three made a suspicious movement
and then failed to heed a warning to stop.
   Another soldier, who took no part in the actual shooting, backed
up the first witness' account that the man, Sean Savage, 24, looked
like he was reaching for a weapon.
   The Special Air Services commando who shot Savage said the Irish
Republican Army member would still be alive if he stopped when
warned.
   The commando, identified only as ``Soldier D'' for security
reasons, said Savage instead moved his hand aggressively toward a
jacket pocket, spurring him and his partner to fire.
   ``We gave Savage an option,'' said the commando, hidden from
view by a curtain during his testimony.
   ``If he had stopped, I'm telling you he would be alive now. He
was given more than enough time. We had no need to give him a
warning _ we gave him the benefit of the doubt.''
   He was cross-examined by Patrick McGrory, the attorney for the
IRA members' families.
   A third soldier said he saw Mairead Farrell, 31, fall to the
ground, but saw no move on her part _ such as lifting her arm in
the air _ to surrender.
   News reports and a documentary by Independent Television in
Britain have quoted witnesses to the March 6 shooting in Gibraltar
as saying Farrell tried to surrender but was shot down.
   The testimony came on the eighth day of an inquest by Gibraltar
Coroner Felix Pizzarello and an 11-man jury into the shooting
deaths of Savage, Farrell and Daniel McCann, 30, by the elite
anti-terrorist unit of the British military.
   Critics of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
claimed the deaths were evidence of an unofficial shoot-to-kill
policy against IRA members on missions against British targets.
   The IRA has acknowledged the three were members of its
organization and that they were on active service when killed.
   A senior British intelligence officer testified earlier that the
soldiers believed the three were planning to set off a car bomb in
this fortress colony with a remote-control radio device.
   ``Soldier D'' said he shot Savage nine times in all, the last
two into Savage's head. He denied shooting Savage repeatedly in the
head after the IRA man fell to the ground or putting his foot on
Savage's chest and shooting him.
   McGrory suggested such action would be ``sheer murder.''
   ``Well, it wouldn't be a nice thing to do,'' the soldier said,
prompting laughter.
   ``Is that the best thing you can say? That it wasn't a very nice
thing to do?'' McGrory asked.
   ``Well, it wasn't, was it,'' the soldier responded.
   Soldier D denied being ``in a frenzy'' at the time.
   ``I carried on shooting until he was no longer a threat,'' he
testified.
   ``Soldier M,'' another witness, said he saw McCann, Farrell and
Savage together before Savage separated himself from the others
minutes before the shootings.
   He said he noticed two soldiers closing in on McCann and
Farrell, then heard gunfire and saw Farrell falling to the ground.
   John Laws, the attorney for the Crown and Gibraltar Police
Commissioner Joseph Canepa, asked Soldier M whether he saw Farrell
raise her hand to surrender.
   Soldier M said he had not.
   Another surveillance team member, identified as ``H,'' said he
saw McCann and Farrell in front of a filling station after they
separated from Savage.
   ``They stopped and appeared concerned,'' H said. ``Soldiers A
and B went into a rigid pose and there was firing. I moved behind
soldiers C and D.''
   Soldiers A through D did the actual shooting.
   ``Savage stopped and spun around and there was an expression of
surprise in his face,'' H told the inquest.
   ``I feared he would be armed and that he would use his weapon
indiscriminately at myself and other bystanders.''
   ``I then heard shots fired by soldiers C and D.''
   The two shooting sites are within a clear line of sight about
200 feet apart near the British colony's border with Spain.
   H said he ``had no doubt that the move made by Savage
constituted a threat to soldiers C and D.''
   The inquest will resume Friday.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Food and Drug Administration
told Congress on Thursday that his agency was moving toward banning
a chemical that once was used widely as a propellant in hairsprays.
   Dr. Frank E. Young stopped short of saying his agency definitely
would make final a three-year-old proposal to prohibit use of the
product, methylene chloride.
   But he told the House Small Business Committee's regulation
subcommittee that based on the data his agency has gathered so far,
``We feel all the evidence indicates it is a hazardous substance.''
   The FDA should announce its final decision on the substance by
the end of the year. Other government agencies also would have to
consider the proposal before it becomes official.
   The FDA, believing the substance is a carcinogen, proposed
banning use of the product in 1985.
   ``Just the introduction of this for just a few seconds in the
air in the bathroom every morning'' is a risk, Young told the
lawmakers.
   The cosmetics industry has conceded that the chemical is
hazardous for cosmeticians who might use it several times a day,
but has argued that it is safe for consumers. But since the
government first proposed to halt the substance's use, the industry
has reduced dramatically its reliance on it.
   The Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance, representing 200
companies that use, distribute and produce chlorinated solvents,
issued a statement saying the FDA overestimates the potential
health risk presented by exposure to methylene chloride.
   Alliance President Paul A. Cammer said a recently updated study
of Eastman Kodak Co. workers exposed to the substance for an
average of 22 years found no increase in overall cancer mortality
resulting from exposure to the chemical.
   Heinz J. Eiermann, director of the FDA's Division of Color and
Cosmetics, said that ``less than 2 percent or 1 percent'' of the
hairspray now in use contains the product.
   ``For all practical purposes, it has been eliminated,'' he said
during a break in the subcommittee meeting.
   Eiermann said the agency was moving toward issuing a final rule
on the product to prevent its use in the future.

<HEAD>Former London Theater Manager, 74</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Donald Albery, a top London theater manager
for 20 years who encouraged playwrights Samuel Beckett, John
Osborne and Brendan Behan, died Wednesday at his home at Monte
Carlo, his family reported. He was 74.
   Albery staged some of the most successful and controversial
plays of that era, and a number of hit musicals, including
``Oliver.''
   He gave Graham Greene his first theatrical chance, staging
Greene's ``The Living Room'' in 1953.
   Albery was chairman and managing director of The Wyndham
Theaters Ltd. until he sold his five theaters _ the Albery,
Criterion, Piccadilly, Wyndham's and the Warehouse _ on his
retirement in 1978.
   He was known for his enterprise in finding and promoting new
plays, his wide-ranging taste, his shrewd eye for commercial
success and his willingness to take risks.
   Although Beckett's ``Waiting for Godot'' was largely ignored at
its London debut in 1955 at the Arts Theater, Albery spotted its
potential. When he staged it at the Criterion later the same year
critics hailed it, establishing Beckett's name in Britain.
   Albery was born into a family with longstanding theatrical ties.
His grandfather was a playwright, his grandmother an actress and
theater manager and his father was one of the most influential
figures in London's theaterland in his own day.
   Albery served his theatrical apprenticeship as general manager
of London's Sadler's Wells Ballet from 1941-45 and began presenting
plays in 1953.
   He took many of director Joan Littlewood's pioneering Theater
Workshop productions to London's West End, the theater district,
after initial East End runs and turned them into big box office
hits. They included Shelagh Delaney's ``A Taste of Honey'' and
Behan's ``The Hostage,'' both staged by him in 1959.
   Albery maintained close links with New York theaters. He gave
American playwright Edward Albee's ``Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?'' its first run in London's West End in 1966.
   He was knighted in 1977.
   Three times married, he leaves a widow, and by previous
marriages three sons and a daughter.

   The chief Philippine negotiator in U.S. bases
talks said Thursday the two sides are close to agreement on how
much cash the United States should pay to use the bases, but remain
sharply divided on non-cash compensation and other issues.
   ``We are still far apart, although we both agree that our hard
components thus far are not far from each other,'' Philippine
Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said in an interview. He defined
``hard components'' as the cash and commodities Congress would be
asked to appropriate as part of the bases agreement.
   He did not say how much aid is proposed, but congressional
sources have said U.S. negotiators offered close to $500 million,
including a doubling of direct bases-related aid to $360 million
for fiscal 1989. Manglapus declined to say how much the Philippines
wants, but said other issues are as important as the demand for
compensation which Manila news reports have put as high as $1.2
billion a year.
   Manglapus said he was not surprised when U.S. Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci told him Wednesday that the United States is
prepared to move its bases out of the country if pushed to pay too
much.
   Carlucci's warning was echoed by Secretary of State George P.
Shultz, who said Thursday the United States may be forced to seek
alternative sites for the bases.
   Speaking to the local chapter of The Asia Society, which seeks
to promote U.S.-Asian friendship, Shultz said it would be
preferable for the United States to maintain its presence at the
bases, but ``there are alternatives which we are having now to
examine.''
   He gave no further details, but other officials have indicated
that the Untied States is exploring the possibility of relocating
elsewhere in East Asia, including Guam.
   Shultz acknowledged that the negotiations on compensation and
other issues ``basically aren't going very well'' and said the
Philippines is overestimating the amount of resources the United
States can provide as compensation.
   Manglapus said his country also is preparing for such a
possibility and said no decision has been made on whether to
conduct negotiations for U.S. access to the massive Clark Air Base,
Subic Navy Base and other facilities after the current agreement
lapses in 1991. The talks now in recess in Manila cover only the
agreement's final two years and not the long-term future of the
bases.
   Manglapus said the Philippines recognizes that the United
States, in its own interest, might one day decide to pull out of
the Philippine bases.
   Carlucci showed ``a considerable amount of open mindedness'' on
bases issues, Manglapus said, describing their meeting as ``very
positive.''
   He said unresolved issues include the storage of nuclear weapons
on the bases, ownership of improvements to the bases, procurement
policies and the write-off of debts for military equipment.
   He said the negotiating panels have agreed to seek ``creative
ways'' to increase non-cash benefits to the Philippines, including
other debt write-offs and increased purchases of Philippine
products, but nothing has been resolved.
   ``We have not gotten anything out of the American panel,'' he
said, criticizing U.S. negotiators for attempting to put the cost
of U.S. operations in the money package, including salaries paid to
Filipino employees and travel expenses incurred by U.S. officials.
   The foreign secretary, who said he is discussing the bases issue
with a variety of U.S. officials but not conducting negotiations
while in Washington, said his private communications with officials
of neighboring Asian governments reveal none of the quiet support
for U.S. bases that American officials claim.
   ``They either say nothing, or they say the opposite,'' said
Manglapus.
   He said the Philippines has been reminding other Southeast Asian
nations of the ``lonely role'' it is playing in hosting the bases.
   Surveys of Filipinos show only a small percentage of outright
opposition to the bases, he said, but a large number of people say
they would want the bases out if the Americans do not improve the
bases agreement, including additional compensation.

   While coastal residents either move to higher ground or shore up
their homes to ride the storm out, insurance companies are bracing
for an onslaught of claims in the wake of Hurricane Gilbert.
   Temporary catastrophe offices will be opened in Texas to help
residents and businesses begin the process of adjusting and paying
losses, according to the Insurance Information Institute.
   ``The catpool will also have personnel in the field,'' said Don
Manthe, chairman of the Texas Catastrophe Property Insurance
Association, or TCPIA, known as catpool. ``We will move our mobile
office to the landfall area jut as soon as it's safe.''
   The catpool provides windstorm and hail coverage for many
coastal residents. It paid $156 million in losses in 1983 as a
result of Hurricane Alicia.
   In Louisiana, where some home owners sought additional storm
coverage and new flood insurance this week, it was too late for
many to buy protection against the hurricane.
   Most insurance companies stopped writing storm-damage coverage
by Wednesday morning. And homeowners gave up the idea of buying new
flood insurance after learning that a new policy would not take
effect for five days.
   ``I personally turned down a half-million-dollar risk,'' said
Randy Maddox, president of Morrison Insurance Agency in New
Orleans. The independent agency represents Aetna and the Hartford
and a number of other companies.
   Maddox said he even turned down his own father's request for
additional coverage. ``It doesn't matter who it is,'' he said.
   Several large companies, including State Farm and Allstate,
stopped doing new business at 10 a.m. Wednesday. Others stopped
Tuesday afternoon.
   Gabrielle Rostran, office manager at the Angelo Leone State Farm
agency, said 30 or 40 customers called Wednesday seeking additional
storm coverage or flood insurance.
   The information institute said flood damage as a result of
hurricanes is covered under special flood insurance policies issued
under the National Flood Insurance Program, which is operated by
the federal government.
   Hardship cases will be settled first, the institute said in a
statement.

<TEXT>
   A buyer for a government defense
contractor was indicted Thursday on charges he accepted kickbacks
in return for helping a Massachusetts company obtain an inflated
contract for Trident nuclear submarine parts.
   U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr. said Robert P. Wasco, 58, of
East Lyme, was charged with two counts of mail fraud and one count
of violating the federal anti-kickback law.
   Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics Corp., is the only
contractor that makes the multimillion-dollar Trident nuclear
submarines for the U.S. Navy.
   The federal grand jury indictment alleges Wasco recommended that
the contract for a submarine part be awarded to Vorias Engineering
of Middleton, Mass., at more than three times what Electric Boat
usually paid for it.
   Soon after Vorias was awarded the $350,000 contract in January
1983, the company paid for vacations for Wasco and his wife in the
Caribbean and in Hawaii, the indictment said.
   If convicted on all three counts, Wasco could be sentenced to up
to 20 years in jail and fined up to $750,000, Twardy said. Wasco is
scheduled for arraigment Sept. 27 in U.S. District Court in New
Haven.

<HEAD>Friend Says Homeless Couple Loved Each Other</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A homeless woman accused of shooting to death
her companion over a bottle of vodka truly loved the man, a drifter
friendly with the couple testified Thursday.
   Robert and Kathlynn T'Souvas had ``a lot of arguments, but they
would end affectionately,'' David M. Bozic, 42, told an Allegheny
County coroner's hearing into the shooting death of T'Souvas.
   T'Souvas, 39, was shot once in the head along the Monongahela
River on Sept. 3. His 36-year-old companion, who took his name but
was not married to him, is charged with criminal homocide in his
death.
   As a 19-year-old soldier from San Jose, Calif., T'Souvas was
accused of taking part in the 1968 My Lai massacre. He was charged
but never tried in the deaths of two Vietnamese civilians.
   Bozic, who was with the T'Souvases on the day of the slaying,
said he allowed the couple to move into his makeshift ``lean-to''
shelter under the Smithfield Street Bridge.
   He said he believed the couple was ``really close _ they loved
each other.''
   Bozic said he doesn't believe Kathlynn T'Souvas shot T'Souvas,
as police charge. However, police said the woman told them she shot
T'Souvas after an argument over a bottle of vodka he held between
his legs.
   Police said T'Souvas' blood alcohol level was 0.26, more than
twice the level of 0.10 for legal intoxication. Police said Ms.
T'Souvas said the couple were drinking all day with Bozic as they
used his .22-caliber revolver to shoot at cans and rats along the
riverbank.
   Bozic said he and the woman waited overnight before reporting
T'Souvas' death to authorities.

<TEXT>
   George Bush said Thursday he hopes Oliver North is found
innocent of charges in the Iran-Contra affair and declined to rule
out a pardon if the former White House aide is convicted. Michael
Dukakis toured Yellowstone National Park and said he was
``awestruck'' by the summer's fire damage.
   Bush seized the role of campaign aggressor for the day, saying
that under Dukakis, Massachusetts has fared poorly on jobs
creation. He derisively awarded his Democratic rival a gold medal
in the ``tax and spend'' competition.
   But the vice president's attack was marred when he omitted a
word from his prepared text and said Massachusetts had lost jobs
since 1983. Official figures show the state has lost manufacturing
jobs _ as Bush's prepared speech said _ but overall employment has
risen by more than 200,000 jobs.
   Dukakis' aides in Massachusetts rushed to criticize Bush's
claim, but the governor himself at first said, ``I'll be responding
to that sometime next week.''
   Later in the same session with reporters, without further
prompting, he said: ``If this nation had 3 percent unemployment
(the rate in Massachusetts) and had 10 years of balanced budgets
and had the record that we have, we could be looking forward to a
future of strength and optimism and jobs for everybody.''
   ``My state has more jobs than people to fill them,'' he said,
asserting that the Reagan administration has left a ``fiscal mess''
in Washington.
   Later, en route to Los Angeles, he added, ``What Mr. Bush has
given us is a mountain of debt, record deficits, a record trade
deficit and an economic future that does not bode well for the
American people.''
   Bush was on the attack in the battle of the television
commercials, as well, airing an ad in environmentally minded
California that accused Dukakis of permitting the harbor in Boston
to become the dirtiest in America. Dukakis ran advertisements
touting his own record on crime fighting and other issues.
   Both campaigns were pointing toward the first campaign debate, a
90-minute televised session in Winston-Salem, N.C., on Sept. 25.
   Bush's office released a schedule showing the vice president
with limited campaigning outside Washington next week and large
blocks of time at home.
   Dukakis also will have a curtailed travel schedule next week,
and aides disclosed that Washington attorney Bob Barnett would join
the group of advisers preparing him for the debate. Barnett played
the role of a Bush stand-in when Democrat Geraldine Ferraro was
preparing for the vice presidential debate in the 1984 campaign.
   Bush said Thursday aboard Air Force Two that he would study
tapes of President Reagan debating ``because I think it's important
... to say what you feel in your heart more than reel off some
statistics.''
   ``What I'd like the bottom line to be is that I come out for
what I am, warts and all,'' he said.
   The topic of the Iran-Contra affair arose when Bush fielded
questions from high school students in California and was asked
whether he would pardon North.
   ``The question is for me _ pardon imputes guilt. And therefore I
have refused to speculate on this because I want to see this man
have a fair trial. I hope he's found innocent. I'm not one of the
North critics. I'm not one of these people that are jumping all
over this guy,'' he said.
   ``So I hope he's found innocent and then I'd have to make a
determination later on as to the equity in that nature.''
   Earlier, Bush ripped into Dukakis in a speech in San Francisco.
   ``The fact is the so-called Massachusetts miracle is really the
Massachusetts mirage. And right now that state is approaching a
fiscal fiasco that might best be described as a budgetary Three
Mile Island ... facing a budgetary meltdown,'' he said.
   Bush said that under Dukakis, ``Massachusetts has lost _ lost _
26,000 jobs since 1983, more than any other state in the country.''
   But Bush's own text said Massachusetts has lost manufacturing
jobs, while federal figures show the state has gained jobs overall.
Spokesman Mark Goodin said Bush was ``referring to manufacturing
jobs'' when he spoke.
   Despite Dukakis having presided over several tax cuts, Bush said
that during his rival's tenure, Massachusetts has had the second
fastest increase in state taxes per capita of all 50 states. ``When
it comes to increasing state spending, per capita, my opponent is
at the top of the list, leading (the) 50 states.
   ``If this were the Olympics, his composite score would make him
the gold winner _ gold medal winner in the tax and spend
competition,'' he said.
   Bush renewed his pledge not to raise taxes as well as his call
for a cut in the tax on investment profits. He said Dukakis has
tried to raise taxes five times, most recently this summer with a
$180 million increase in business taxes, sales taxes and personal
income taxes.
   Dukakis, rarely seen wearing anything other than a dark suit and
red necktie, visited Yellowstone dressed in khaki pants, a brown
suede jacket and boots that looked nearly new.
   He said he was ``awestruck by what's happened here.''
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen said as he
campaigned through his native Texas that the Democratics' fortunes
have bottomed out after a rough patch and were on the rebound.
   ``We've see in the last four or five days, as we've taken these
issues on, on defense and these...outrageous charges on patriotism,
that the polls have turned around,'' he told reporters.
   Many polls in recent days have found a slight advantage for
Bush, although a Washington Post-ABC survey conducted Sept. 7-13
reported Dukakis with 48 percent support and Bush with 45, a
statistical dead heat.
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle was in
Oklahoma City during the day, where he indicated he was tired of
having Dukakis refer to him as ``J. Danforth Quayle.''
   He said the name Danforth comes from a friend of his family who
was killed during World War II. ``It is not a family name,'' he
said.

   Moslem kidnappers holding four educators
issued a photograph Thursday of two of their American hostages with
a handwritten statement setting out conditions under which their
captives might be freed.
   The offer, from the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine organization, was in a note delivered to a Western news
agency in Beirut. The note included a Polaroid picture of Alann
Steen, 49, of Boston, and Jesse Jonathan Turner, 41, a native of
Boise, Idaho. The men have been held for nearly 20 months.
   The picture showed Steen and Turner, smiling broadly, resting on
a mattress with a flowered pattern and a violet pillow. Each was
holding a cigarette. Both wore navy blue outfits and had long hair.
Steen was clean-shaven while Turner had a bushy beard.
   Steen; Turner; Robert Polhill, 54, originally of New York City,
and Mithileshwar Singh, 60, an Indian who is a legal resident alien
of the United States, were kidnapped on Jan. 24, 1987, from the
campus of the U.S.- affiliated Beirut University College by gunmen
posing as riot police.
   The statement, written in Arabic, hinted that the Moslem group
would free its hostages if the U.S. administration undertook an
initiative within one week in support of the Palestinian uprising
in Israeli-occupied territories. The uprising began Dec. 8.
   Official U.S. policy is that Washington will not bargain under
such conditions.
   The hostages' wives, who still are living at the campus, were
not available for immediate comment on the new statement. Telephone
calls at the college go through a switchboard, which closes at 11
p.m., an hour before the statement was delivered.
   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine is believed to be
sympathetic to the Palestinians as well as Iran's revolutionary
patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The four educators are among 17 foreigners missing and believed
held hostage in Lebanon. The 17 include nine Americans, three
Britons, an Indian, an Irishman, an Italian and two unidentified
men.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped in Beirut
on March 16, 1985.
   The statement said, ``Our organization plans to undertake a
positive initiative to ease the issue of the hostages. But it needs
adequate reactions by international forums toward the rights of our
Moslem (Palestinian) people in their struggle against the Zionist
enemy.
   ``The U.S. administration should be the first among the
governments that should declare a clear, positive stance toward the
rights of our people in harmony with its claims of defending human
rights.''
   It concluded, ``At this sensitive stage of the uprising led by
comrade strugglers in the interior (of the occupied territories),
we offer this intiative and expect from the governments concerned a
response within one week of the publication of this statement. We
then will be ready to advance further in this initiative.''
   The term ``ease the issue of the hostages'' usually indicates
willingness to free the captives.
   The statement said the group's offer was timed to coincide with
the 10th month of the uprising against Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   ``Every day and every month of the history of this uprising is
proving that the element of faith is growing greater,'' the
statement said.
   ``From this concept, the organization of Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine declares its blessing for all the factions
of the Moslem Palestinian people as well as the entire Islamic
nation.''

   An Ethiopian Airlines jetliner with
104 people aboard crash-landed Thursday at Bahar Dar airport, and
an undetermined number of people were injured, the Ethiopian
television reported.
   The state-owned TV did not report any deaths from the 12:45 a.m
(5:45 a.m. EDT) crash-landing of the Boeing 737.
   The jetliner was on a domestic flight from Addis Ababa to the
Red Sea port of Asmara with a stopover at Bahar Dar, 186 miles
north of the capital, Addis Ababa.
   The cause of the accident was not reported.
   The TV station said those injured were flown to the hospital in
Asmara, 248 miles to the north, and also to Addis Ababa. The report
did not indicate the nature of the injuries, whether the aircraft
sustained damage or the nationalities of those aboard.
   Bahar Dar is in northwestern Ethiopia at the shores of Lake
Tana, the source of the Blue Nile, and the picturesque region is
frequented by tourists.

   Michael Dukakis, viewing
the devastation caused by fires in one of the nation's most popular
parks, resisted being drawn Thursday into another long-distance
spat with presidential rival George Bush.
   ``I'll be responding to that sometime next week,'' said Dukakis,
when asked his reaction to Bush's latest attack on the Dukakis
claim that under his governance, Massachusetts has undergone an
economic ``miracle.''
   Bush said that people and business were leaving Massachusetts
and that ``my opponent ranks first in spending increases, second in
tax hikes.''
   ``If this were the Olympics his composite score would make him
the gold medal winner in the tax and spend category,'' Bush said.
   When the questioner said ``but Mr. Bush said it today,'' Dukakis
just smiled and replied, ``Good luck to Mr. Bush.''
   After responding to a number of questions about the fires and
gun control, Dukakis apparently thought better of his refusal to
respond to Bush.
   Without further prompting, he said: ``If this nation had 3
percent unemployment (the rate in Massachusetts) and had 10 years
of balanced budgets and had the record that we have, we could be
looking forward to a future of strength and optimism and jobs for
everybody. My state has more jobs than people to fill them.''
   He compared conditions in Massachusetts with ``what's happened
under Mr. Bush and the administration of which he's been a part and
... the kind of fiscal mess I'm going to inherit as the next
president of the United States.''
   After flying from West Yellowstone, Mont., to Los Angeles,
Dukakis showed less reluctance to join the fray with Bush.
   ``Anybody who'd compare my state's economy with Three Mile
Island must be suffering meltdown,'' he told reporters at the
airport. ``What Mr. Bush has given us is a mountain of debt, record
deficits, a record trade deficit and an economic future that does
not bode well for the American people.''
   Dukakis was briefed by officials at the fire-blackened national
park on efforts to contain the blazes. Bob Barbee, superintendent
of the park, said afterward, ``We're not out of the woods yet.''
   The briefing took place on a road overlooking the Madison River
and a blackened hillside.
   The Democratic presidential candidate, rarely seen wearing
anything other than a dark suit and red necktie, dressed for the
occasion in khaki pants, a brown suede jacket and boots that looked
nearly new.
   Joining him were four Democratic governors _ Mike Sullivan of
Wyoming, Ted Schwinden of Montana, Roy Romer of Colorado and Cecil
Andrus of Idaho.
   Dukakis was told that fires had burned over 1.5 million acres in
the park and near it.
   Dukakis said he was ``awestruck by what's happened here.''
   ``I can't remember a year in my lifetime,'' he said ``when the
weather seemed to be more important to us in many ways ... the
drought, the heat, and now a massive hurricane bearing down on us
are reminding us not only of our mortality but of the importance of
pulling together and caring for each other.''
   Questioned about his position on gun control, Dukakis said he
believes hunters and sportsmen had a right to own guns and use them
``in a legitimate and responsible way.''
   ``I think people who want to protect themselves in their homes
should be able to do so subject to the appropriate state laws,'' he
said. ``Let me remind you, Mr. Bush was voting for gun control when
he was in Congress.''
   He refused to enter a controversy over the way the fires have
been handled, saying, ``Put out the fires first and make dure
they're under control.'' Then, he added, there would be time to
review the policies.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush and Democrat
Michael Dukakis are in a virtual dead heat in Kentucky's
presidential race, according to a new poll.
   However, the Bluegrass State Poll published in Friday's
Louisville Courier-Journal also showed that Bush is attracting the
kind of support that has resulted in Republican victories in six of
Kentucky's last eight presidential elections.
   Bush edges Dukakis 47 percent to 45 percent in the poll
conducted Sept. 6-10, but the vice president's lead is rendered
meaningless by the poll's four-point margin of error.
   Nearly 80 percent of likely Republican voters said they intend
to vote for the vice president and nearly one-third of likely
Democratic voters said they plan to support him.
   The newspaper interviewed 586 likely voters by telephone who
either said they would vote for a candidate or were uncertain but
leaning toward a candidate.
   Kentucky offers nine electoral votes in the Nov. 8 general
election..

   You don't have to tell Louisiana old-timers what to do when a
hurricane begins brewing in the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``Because of the size and strength of this storm, we didn't have
to be told to leave,'' said Linda Toupuisaid, who along with her
husband runs the T&T Grocery in Holly Beach, La., where by mid-day
Thursday fewer than 25 of the coastal town's 100 residents were
still around. ``It could take a northerly course. If it's any time
to pack up for one, this is the one.
   ``This is the first time we've packed up in years,'' said Mrs.
Touchet, whose living quarters are in the rear of the grocery.
   Their back yard is beach and the Gulf of Mexico, where Hurricane
Gilbert, packing winds of 120 mph, was moving slowly toward the
north-northwest.
   Isolated squalls from Gilbert's northern edge knocked out power
Thursday morning in parts of Grand Isle, a resort community on a
barrier island of the Louisiana coast. Mayor Andy Valence warned
some 2,000 residents who evacuated Wednesday not to return too soon.
   ``We're asking all of those people to stay put where they are
because Grand Isle won't be a very nice place to be today,'' said
Valence.
   Tides were expected to reach 5 feet above normal all along the
coast and Valence said Louisiana 1, the only route from Grand Isle
to the mainland, was certain to flood.
   Some 20,000 people had been ordered to evacuate the state's
coast by Thursday afternoon, but many hadn't waited for marching
orders.
   And in Cameron, Hayes Picou felt no more pressure in making an
evacuation decision for the hurricane-savvy parish.
   ``You just take the data available and like any other job, you
make a decision,'' the 39-year-old parish civil defense director
said as he ordered what he called a precautionary evacuation of the
remainder of the population of 10,000.
   ``Sixty-five percent have already gone,'' he said. ``That's
enough data right there. Should you second-guess 65 percent of the
people?''
   By 6 p.m., about 75 percent of the population had left. Most of
the others said they would stay put unless the storm takes a turn
to the north.
   Picou said it was as total an evacuation as he'd seen in this
coastal parish since Hurricane Audrey swept a tidal wave through
the marsh, killing 500 people.
   Audrey is burned into the minds of the population and people are
educated to the danger of hurricanes from birth, said Picou.
   In fact, Hurricane Gilbert became a classroom exercise for the
eighth grade at Grand Caillou Middle School this week.
   ``We're teaching it while it's here,'' said teacher David
Duplantis, who took advantage of the weather to teach how air
currents develop into hurricanes.
   ``Everybody's saying it's the worst one yet,'' said Melissa
Guidry, 13, who lives in a trailer along Bayou Grand Caillou in
Dulac. ``If it's worse than Juan, then I guess I'm scared.''
   ``There was one parent who just left here, she said they were
taking their children to Tennessee,'' said Principal Danny Smith,
who used a hurricane tracking map to plot Gilbert's progress.
   Others plan ahead for these things, including one man who told
school secretary Joyce Trahan he was putting his pirogue _ a
flat-bottom canoe _ on top of his car.
   ``He said, `I'm gonna drive north and when I get to someplace
where somebody asks me what that is on top of my car, I'll know
I've gone far enough,''' the secretary said.

   Six people died when Hurricane Gilbert,
the strongest storm on record, battered the Yucatan Peninsula and
left this city on Thursday littered with boats and seaweed hundreds
of yards from shore.
   Along the northern Mexican gulf coast, authorities evacuated
fishing villages and towns as Gilbert churned in that direction
with 120 mph winds. On Wednesday morning, when the hurricane
slammed into the Caribbean resort of Cancun, winds topped 160 mph.
   The storm left much of Yucatan without communication,
electricity or drinking water. Airports were shut, most roads were
blocked and supplies were running low. Campeche's governor declared
the state a disaster area Thursday afternoon and appealed for
relief supplies.
   Thousands of tourists in resort areas were stranded, many
surviving on cookies and milk handed out in shelters.
   In Campeche, the state capital on the peninsula's west coast,
``there is no light, there is no radio, there is nothing,'' said
Ramon Castillo, a nightwatchman at the newspaper Novedades de
Campeche.
   ``The whole city is flooded. Everything is dark,'' he said.
``I've lived here all my life and I have never seen bad weather
like this. People are scared.''
   The storm lifted boats from their moorings and clumps of seaweed
and deposited them on Campeche streets hundreds of yards from the
seashore. Much of the city was flooded and littered with uprooted
trees.
   Later Thursday, the storm moved toward northeastern Mexico and
the southeastern coast of Texas.
   ``It's still moving west-northwest, which is good news for Texas
but not so good news for the northern part of Mexico,'' said
National Hurricane Center director Robert Sheets in Coral Gables,
Fla.. He said it appeared the storm was strengthening.
   Luis Montiel, spokesman for the Tamaulipas state government,
said people were evacuated from fishing villages and towns on the
northern coast into shelters in Matamoros, a city of 400,000 about
12 miles inland near the Texas border city of Brownsville.
   Farther south, the oil port of Tampico, population 700,000,
evacuated people from low-lying marshy areas to higher ground, said
Montiel, speaking in a telephone interview from the state capital
of Ciudad Victoria.
   Twenty-four-foot waves from the hurricane pounded the popular
resorts of Cancun and Cozumel early Wednesday, inflicting heavy
damage on hotels and stranding thousands of tourists.
   As the 450-mile-wide storm charged into the Gulf of Mexico, it
drenched the Yucatan state capital of Merida and the gulf port
cities of Puerto Progreso, Campeche and Ciudad del Carmen.
   Many areas in Yucatan remained cut off from the outside world,
so there were no comprehensive reports on injuries and property
damage. Authorities were particularly concerned about Isla Mujeres,
a tiny resort island just off Cancun.
   A navy spokesman in Mexico City said he had no word on the
plight of an estimated 15,000 people stranded in Isla Mujeres.
Three ferries linking the island with the mainland were lost in the
storm.
   The government news agency Notimex said the navy was looking for
eight Cuban boats that were in Mexican waters before the storm. It
was not known how many were aboard.
   In Campeche, two babies drowned as residents of a poor,
low-lying neighborhood tried to flee, said Omar Cantu, editor of
the Novedades de Campeche.
   Four people died when a wall collapsed on them in the town of
Dzidzantun north of Merida, Yucatan Gov. Victor Manzanillo Shaffer
told reporters in Merida.
   He said the storm did millions of dollars worth of damage on the
peninsula. Manzanillo said 20,000 people had taken refuge in
shelters in Merida and crop damage was extensive.
   He said the storm changed the coastline, with familiar beaches
vanishing and new ones appearing.
   The state of Yucatan has a population of about 1.2 million. The
entire Yucatan Peninsula, which also includes the states of
Quintana Roo and Campeche, has a population of about 2 million.
   A top government official said the army was taking a portable
communications tower and a ground satellite dish to Cancun. He said
the government hoped to have telephone, radio and television
communications restored Friday.
   The Interior Ministry said three trucks loaded with food,
medicine and clothing were en route to Cancun.
   The ministry also said the storm seriously damaged the luxurious
hotel zone in Cancun and destroyed about a quarter of the homes on
the nearby island of Cozumel.
   However, ministry subsecretary Jorge Carrillo Olea later said
there was no ``serious damage'' to the hotel zone. He also
described the flooding in Campeche as minor.
   Local officials said 11,000 tourists and residents were
evacuated from Cancun. Earlier reports put the figure at 36,000.
The storm hit just before the height of the tourist season.
   ``We're just watching and waiting,'' said Joyce Gripshover of
Covington, Ky., whose daughter and son-in-law were at the Kentucky
Association of Realtors convention in Cancun. ``What else can you
do?
   The storm, spawned Saturday southeast of Puerto Rico, appeared
to have hit Jamaica the hardest. That island nation's prime
minister, Edward Seaga, said Wednesday that it destroyed about
100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes. He estimated damage at $8
billion.
   At least 41 people died when the storm hit Jamaica, Haiti and
the Dominican Republic earlier this week.

   The first black mayor of Birmingham said
Thursday night the deaths of four girls in a church bombing 25
years ago ``was not the end but the beginning of a story we are
still writing together.''
   Richard Arrington, in his third term as the mayor of a city once
bitterly divided racially, spoke at a service held in memory of the
victims of the Sept. 15, 1963, bombing at the 16th Street Baptist
Church.
   Arrington told the racially mixed congregation of about 1,400
that ``the torch that we raise tonight is raised by two hands _ one
black and one white.''
   Arrington described Birmingham as a city of change and said the
bombing by a Ku Klux Klansman ``was a tragedy of a community and a
tragedy of a people. So immense was that tragedy that it resounded
around our globe.
   ``We have the power to transcend that tragic event. We are
determined it will have a redeeming quality.''
   A plaque in the church contains pictures of four girls with the
inscription: ``May men learn to replace bitterness and violence
with love and understanding.''
   The present pastor of the church, Rev. James E. Young, said
Birmingham ``has provided spiritual and moral leadership to the
world for the past quarter century.''
   Referring to the church bombing and to other civil rights
problems, Young described the 1960s as ``years of silent tears''
and told the congregation, ``We are here to worship the God who
brought triumph out of tragedy.''
   Thursday night's service was sponsored by a biracial committee
that sent invitations to other community groups that read: ``In
embracing our history there is healing.''
   Arrington and black and white ministers spoke in memory of
Cynthia Wesley, Addie Mae Collins and Carol Robertson, all 14, and
Denise McNair, 11, who were preparing for a youth program when the
explosion killed them a quarter-century ago.
   More than 40 earlier bombings had occurred in Birmingham during
the civil rights struggles of the late 1950s and early 1960s, but
no one was killed in those.
   The church bombing galvanized the city.
   ``All of us are victims, and most of us are innocent victims,''
said the mayor at the time, Albert Boutwell.
   A citywide moment of prayer was observed at noon the next day,
but lowering of racial barriers took much longer.
   ``Be concerned not only with who murdered them, but with the
philosophy of life that murdered them,'' Martin Luther King Jr.
said at the combined funeral of three of the girls.
   All visible barriers now are gone in Birmingham, which has six
blacks and three whites on its City Council.
   A retired automobile mechanic and Ku Klux Klansman, Robert
Edward Chambliss, was convicted in 1977 of murdering Miss McNair.
He died in prison after eight years.
   Miss McNair's father, Chris McNair, a former state legislator
and now a Jefferson County commissioner, said he still is not
satisfied.
   ``I think there are others out there who roam just as free as I
am who will never be brought to justice,'' he said.
   McNair said that although segregation in politics and business
has ended, it bothers him that most churches still are either white
or black.
   ``Mankind needs the church or the synagogue,'' he said. ``This
is needed. This is part of man's inner being. If they can't come
together at that time, then how are they going to come together in
genuineness at any other occasion? I have to doubt it.''

   Mario Biaggi, the popular Bronx congressman who
gave up his seat after his racketeering conviction, was handily
defeated by a state assemblyman Thursday in one of three primary
races overshadowed by political corruption charges.
   Biaggi, implicated in the far-reaching Wedtech scandal, resigned
from Congress too late to have his name removed from the ballot in
a three-way race with state Assemblyman Eliot Engel and former
Assemblyman Vincent Marchiselli.
   With 473 of 494 precincts reporting, Engel had 12,731 votes, or
50 percent; Marchiselli had 6,407 votes, or 25 percent; and Biaggi
had 6,370 votes, or 25 percent.
   The name of another Bronx congressman, Robert Garcia, came up in
testimony in the Wedtech case, but he has not been charged with any
wrongdoing. In a district where winning the Democratic nomination
is tantamount to election, Garcia easily defeated opponents Pedro
Espada and Ismael Betancourt.
   With 347 of 360 precincts reporting, Garcia had 15,855 votes, or
60 percent; Espada had 7,165 votes, or 27 percent; and Betancourt
had 3,340, or 13 percent.
   State Senate Minority Leader Manfred Ohrenstein, a 28-year
veteran of the Legislature, held off a well-financed Democratic
primary challenge in Manhattan from Joseph Rose, 29, the son of a
wealthy developer.
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Ohrenstein had
11,270 votes, or 53 percent, and Rose had 10,056 votes, or 47
percent.
   Ohrenstein has been charged with illegally putting campaign
workers on the Senate payroll during the 1986 elections.
   In other races, in suburban Westchester County, former Cuomo
administration official Nita Lowey defeated Hamilton Fish 3rd and
businessman Dennis Mehiel for the right to oppose Republican Rep.
Joseph DioGuardi in November.
   With 464 of 493 precincts reporting, Lowey had 9,730 votes, or
44 percent; Fish had 7,988 votes, or 36 percent; and Mehiel had
4,580 votes, or 21 percent.
   In the Buffalo area, Jack Kemp gave up his congressional seat to
make his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential
nomination. In the Democratic primary there, David Swarts, the Erie
County clerk, defeated businessman George Hasiotis.
   With 463 of 490 precincts reporting, Swarts had 9,596 votes or
70 percent, and Hasiotis had 4,197 votes or 30 percent.
   Massachusetts also had a primary Thursday, but there were few
statewide races. On Cape Cod, Republicans Jon L. Bryan defeated
Martha P. Keyes competed for the right to challenge Democratic Rep.
Gerry Studds, who along with Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank, is
one of the two openly homosexual members of Congress.
   With 57 of 189 precincts reporting, Bryan had 2,390 votes, or 56
percent, to Keyes' 1,844 votes, or 44 percent, according to
unofficial returns.
   Bryan, a USAir pilot who teaches management and marketing at
Bridgewater State College, and Keyes, an English teacher, made
their first political race. In neighboring Rhode Island, Patrick
Kennedy, 21-year-old son of Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
won election Wednesday to the state House by defeating five-term
Rep. John Skeffington. There was no Republican candidate.
   And Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, the House Banking Committee
chairman, narrowly survived a Democratic primary, capturing 55
percent of the vote against Scott Wolf, a political consultant who
was making his first bid for office. St Germain will face
Republican Ronald K. Machtley in November.
   In Delaware, final results of a recount showed that Lt. Gov.
S.B. Woo won last Saturday's Democratic Senate primary by 71 votes
over civic activist Samuel S. Beard. Initially, a clerical error in
the vote tally had shown Beard winning. Woo will face three-term
Republican Sen. William V. Roth Jr. in November.

   Biaggi, first elected to Congress in 1968, was convicted of
various charges in two federal cases over the past 18 months but
did not resign until after his conviction in August in the Wedtech
case. Had he remained in office, he could have faced expulsion by
his colleagues.
   By that time it was too late for candidates to get on the ballot
for the primary and it was thought Biaggi would get votes Thursday
because of his popularity and because a Biaggi victory would give
the remains of the borough's political machine the chance to pick a
successor in a special election.
   Biaggi already holds the Republican line for the November
election.
   Garcia stepped up his schedule late in the primary when it
became apparent that Espada, a community health center director,
represented a serious challenge. Betancourt had lost in two earlier
primary bids.
   In the northern suburbs of Westchester, Fish was the first
member of his politically active family to seek office as a
Democrat. Fishes have been active in the GOP since the party was
founded and Fish's father, Hamilton Fish Jr., represents a
neighboring district in Congress that had previously been
represented by the young Fish's grandfather.

Thursday, and police were empowered to force stores to open quickly
to avoid shortages.
   The area contains more than 1 million of this Caribbean island
nation's 2.3 million people and embraces four of Jamaica's 14
parishes, or counties, on the badly hit east coast _ Kingston, St.
Andrew, St. Catherine and St. Thomas.
   Seaga said in a nationwide radio broadcast that the one-month
``period of public emergency'' was put into effect ``to enable
normalcy to resume in the shortest possible time and to allow the
rebuilding process to begin.''
   He continued a dusk-to-dawn curfew established in Kingston
earlier this week to prevent looting.
   At least 26 people were killed when Hurricane Gilbert, the
strongest storm this century, swept through Jamaica on Monday, the
government-run Jamaica Information Service reported. Officials fear
the toll will mount as communication is re-established with the
interior.
   Five people were reported killed in the Dominican Republic and
10 in Haiti, where the military government declared its own state
of emergency on the wrecked southern peninsula.
   Seaga said the international airport at Montego Bay had reopened
to all traffic and the Norman Manley International Airport at
Kingston will resume full operations shortly. Three commercial
airlines were flying out of Kingston airport Thursday.
   The information service said a period of public emergency is the
equivalent of a declaration of a disaster area in the United States
and is not a state of emergency ``in any form whatsoever.''
   Under the emergency regulations, police can force gas stations
and all stores selling food, hardware, drugs and fuel to open
Friday morning and all other stores to open as soon as electricity
is available.
   ``The failure of shops to reopen has placed an unbearable burden
on official sources to provide meals through centers of refuge,''
Seaga said.
   Women and children carried plastic containers of water on their
heads and stood in line at service stations for kerosene with which
to cook what food could be found.
   A helmeted soldier with a rifle and a German shepherd guard dog
stood outside the Hometride Bakery and Food Centre, controlling the
number of people allowed inside.
   ``There is a possibility, a very real possibility, of a (food)
shortage, particularly of chicken,'' said Jean Lewis, director of
public affairs for the Jamaican Information Service. ``Supermarkets
are still pretty well stocked, but how long that will remain the
case is another matter.''
   It was sunny and humid in the capital, which was still littered
with zinc roofing, toppled utility poles and other storm debris.
   A government spokeswoman said there had been some looting right
after the hurricane winds died down, but it appeared to be under
control.
   The capital's two radio stations broadcast advisories to boil
water and not to touch downed telephone or power lines, and passed
along personal messages to remote regions of the country.
   By Thursday only 10 percent of Jamaica's telephones were back in
service. said Marge Boberschmidt, a spokeswoman for American
Telephone and Telegraph.
   AT&T secured a single telephone line in Jamaica Wednesday night
and began relaying one-page messages from stranded Americans to
worried friends and relatives back home.
   Ms. Lewis estimated 93 percent of the island was still without
electricity. Stores and hotels used gasoline-powered generating
plants. The 18-floor Pegasus Hotel, popular with visiting
businessmen, was dimly lit and without elevator service.
   Seaga estimated the hurricane damage in Jamaica at $8 billion.
Relief supplies began arriving Thursday for some of the country's
half-million homeless.
   Sports stadiums, churches, government buildings and movie
theaters were used to house an estimated 150,000 people, the
government said.
   The government has said about 500,000, or more than one-fifth of
the Jamaican population was homeless. Seaga estimated 100,000 of
the island's 500,000 homes were completely wiped out and an
additional 300,000 had roofs ripped off or other severe damage.
   Gilbert strengthened from a tropical storm into a hurricane
Saturday night 160 miles south of Puerto Rico. It skirted the
Dominican Republic and Haiti on Sunday, plowed straight through
Jamaica on Monday, brushed past the Cayman Islands Tuesday and
slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday morning. The hurricane
on Thursday was headed toward northern Mexico and southeastern
Texas.

   More than 50,000 people fled rising
floodwaters Thursday as Hurricane Gilbert battered the Yucatan
Peninsula and its posh resorts. Two babies drowned.
   Gilbert, the strongest storm on record, left much of the Yucatan

were closed, most roads were blocked and supplies were running
short.
   Looting was reported in the resort city of Cancun on the east

to evacuate their homes for fear of burglars.
   Later Thursday, the storm continued on its west-northwest path
heading toward northern Mexico and the coast of Texas.

   President Reagan said Thursday there is ``no

during the Iran-Contra crisis, and the White House denied any
serious thought was given to removing him from office by
constitutional means.
   ``It's total nonsense,'' said White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater. ``It speaks more to the state of mind of some of the
staff here than it does about the president.''
   Fitzwater was referring to White House aides who were
interviewed by James Cannon, a longtime associate of Howard H.
Baker Jr., on the weekend in 1987 when Baker replaced Donald T.
Regan as White House chief of staff.
   In a new book by two newspaper reporters, Cannon is quoted as

<HEAD>Parallel To Elections Seen In Choices Of Jewish Holy Days</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   These are the ``days of awe'' for Jews, and some
of their leaders compare it to the time preceding national
elections, which also involves making critical choices.
   The 10 High Holy Days commenced Sept. 12 on Rosh Hashana, the
traditional start of a new year, and last through next Wednesday,
Sept. 21, Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.
   It's a period of self-examination, repentence for faults and
rededication to God's goodness, compassion and justice.
   ``Behold I set before you this day life and death, blessing and
curse. Choose life, that you and your children may live.'' That
Scriptural meditation runs through the occasion.
   Theodore Ellenoff, president of the American Jewish Committee,
notes that both the United States and Israel are approaching
national elections in which they also will ``set their courses for
the future.''
   He notes that Jewish tradition says the blast of the shofar, or
ram's horn, heard in synagogues on the holy days, will also signal
the arrival of the Messiah to bring world peace and harmony.
Ellenoff adds:
   ``In the forthcoming elections, American and Israelis have the
responsibility to take the first small step toward fulfillment of
that Messianic dream.''
   The dream is expressed in the prayers of the holiday worship:
``Open for us the gates of righteousness. Open the gates that yield
... blessing and brotherhood, compassion and kindness, devotion and
dignity ... justice and joy...
   ``Hasten the advent of Messianic redemption.''
   Rabbi William Berkowitz, national president of the American
Jewish Heritage Committee, suggested that Jews engage in a
``spiritual election campaign'' about basic decisions for their own
lives.
   ``We can take inspiration from this year's presidential election
campaign, which confronts fundamental issues and demands clear
choices,'' he said.
   ``So too, must American Jewry engage in a kind of spiritual
election campaign in which they confront the fundamental issues
facing the Jewish community and in turn engage in some basic
choices.''
   The Rabbinical Council of America, representing Orthodox
Judaism, said the forthcoming presidential election involves the
economy, human rights and defense, and urged Jews to vote in it.
   Rabbi Moses A. Birnbaum, president of the New York Board of
Rabbis, says Jews have ``always cherished one ideal'' _ the
``obligation upon us literally to `repair the world,' the vision of
a world healed _ by us.''
   ``As we wish each other life, let us wish each other the courage
and strength to turn the vision into reality,'' he said.
   Citing the recurrent prayer at holiday services, ``Inscribe us
into the Book of Life, O You who delight in life,'' Birnbaum said
``no prayer is more important'' for Jews and all humankind.
   ``But we live in days when life is often cheap, more often
corroded by cynicism and corruption. We see _ if we have the
courage to look _ so many countless lives made unlivable by poverty
and disease and homelesness.
   ``We see _ if we do not turn away _ lives inflamed by prejudice
and hatred and fantaticism. We witness millions of lives snuffed
out by senseless wars and bloody persecution.''
   He said surmounting these anti-life conditions demands not only
prayer but ``our unflagging determination to work for justice and
equality for all God's children.''
   Mazon, a Jewish hunger reponse, urged Jews to donate money saved
by fasting on Yom Kippur ``to feed those who fast not on account of
faith, but because of famine.''
   Saying 40,000 children will die of hunger on the day of Yom
Kippur, as happens daily, the organization said that when ``we are
given the opportunity to sustain life itself, it is not only an
opportunity, it is a mandate.''

   Bishop Peter Rogness of the Southeastern Wisconsin Synod of the

would not be sanctioned to perform homosexual marriages.''
   Bartos says that while bishops are influential, church
conventions and not bishops set policy, and conventions have not
specified whether congregations can authorize homosexual marriages,
leaving open the door for congregations to decide about it.

<HEAD>Tribute to Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly on Showtime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's something kind of poignant about
watching wealthy rock stars pay homage to those two monumental
influences, Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly, both of whom died
basically penniless. But at least they know who they owe.
with the just-released album, Showtime has produced
an inspired video tribute to the folk legends, featuring
performances by and interviews with Bruce Springsteen, U2, Pete
Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, Little Richard and John Cougar Mellencamp,   To
go along 
among others.
   ``The All-Star Tribute to Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly''
premieres Saturday with additional playdates Sept. 20, 26, 30 and
Oct. 9 and 11. Robbie Robertson is the narrator. The success of the
film was probably never in doubt since it comes from director Jim
Brown and producer Harold Leventhal, the team responsible for the
Emmy-winning 1982 documentary, ``The Weavers: Wasn't That a Time.''
   Though it was Bob Dylan's idea that spawned the CBS record,
``Folkways: A Vision Shared,'' and therefore the Showtime special,
he doesn't appear on camera. But, against a backdrop of old still
photographs that show how much Dylan tried to emulate Woody
Guthrie, down to the cigarette hanging from his lip, he talkis has been
using against Bush in recent campaign appearances.
   ``Michael Dukakis balanced 10 budgets in a row and still cut
taxes five times,'' the announcer in the 30-second
``Responsibility'' ad says.
   The ad also refers to the rate of personal income growth in
Massachusetts, which is twice the national average, and the
governor's successful effort to win passage of the first state law
guaranteeing health insurance to virtually all workers.
   ``That's why America's governors, both Democrat and Republican,
voted Michael Dukakis the most effective governor in the nation,''
the announcer says.
   Dukakis campaign aides declined to say how much the campaign was
spending on the new round of ads, to be supplemented by a new
commerical paid for by the Democratic National Committee.
   The naming of John Hancock's David D'Allesandro to head the
Dukakis ad team was characterized by several Dukakis aides as a key
move in an effort to bring more direction to advertising strategy.
   The move was orchestrated by John Sasso, the Dukakis confidant
who recently returned as vice chairman of the Democratic campaign,
said Dukakis media adviser Francis O'Brien.

   For 90 minutes, with no notes, no managers and no neutral
corners, George Bush and Michael Dukakis meet one week from tonight
in a presidential debate. It is a high-risk political arena and in
a close, volatile election campaign, the debate and a mid-October
rematch could be pivotal.
   This Great Debate, like those that have gone before, is likely
to defy the long-rehearsed efforts of the candidates to take
control of its course and outcome. Over the 28 years since the
first nationally televised debates, the most telling issues
generated have not been on topics the candidates chose but have
involved image, style _ or error.
   The unpredictable, unmanageable nature of the debates seemed to
concern Vice President Bush and his Republican camp more than it
troubled Dukakis. The Democratic nominee wanted more debates, four
instead of two, and a less controlled format, without a panel of
questioners.
   In the debate over ground rules, Bush chairman James A. Baker
III got his way: Fewer debates, in the middle of the heaviest
television sports schedule of the year, with a panel of three at
each debate to put questions to the candidates.
   Bush and Dukakis meet next Sunday, Sept. 25, at Wake Forest
University in Winston-Salem, N.C. Their second debate will be in
Los Angeles Oct. 13 or 14. In between, on Oct. 5, the vice
presidential candidates, Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and
Republican Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana are to debate in Omaha, Neb.
   The Dukakis camp had proposed that there be only a moderator,
not a panel of questioners, so that the two presidential candidates
would confront and question each other.
   That kind of one-on-one meeting has been proposed by producers
and spurned by candidates before, out of concern that a
challenging, questioning debater would come on too strong for the
taste of the voters. As a result, the format in which candidates
are questioned, answer in turn, then get time for rebuttals, has
become the standard.
   Bush obviously wasn't interested in any new-look ventures.
Debates have not produced his finest moments in politics. He sat
silent and frustrated in Nashua, N.H., in 1980 while Ronald Reagan,
then a rival for the Republican nomination, took command of the
microphone _ and their presidential primary debate. It's hard to
remember anything about his 1984 debate with Democratic vice
presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro _ except that the next day,
Bush awkwardly remarked that he had ``tried to kick a little ass.''
   Primary campaign debates multiplied in the race for the 1988
nominations. Everybody wanted one, which produced a roster of more
than 40 debates and candidate forums.
   Bush took part in seven debates with his rivals for the
Republican nomination.
   Dukakis has had more warmups, including 21 campaign debates on
his way to the Democratic nomination. Between his two tours as
governor, after Massachusetts voters denied him renomination a
decade ago, Dukakis spent part of his time moderating a debate
program on public television.
   ``I have respect for him as a debater,`` Bush said during
negotiations on their debates. `` ... We're talking about the
technical thing in debate, where I think he is very good _ probably
far better than I am.''
   That fits one of the favored tactics of 1988, lowering
expectations. Or at least trying to do so; the ploy is not likely
to work in a campaign debate, at least not in the match of a
two-term vice president against a governor of Massachusetts.
   If lowered expectations do serve any candidate in the debate
sequence, it is more likely to be Quayle, belittled by Dukakis and
the Democrats. In the vice presidential debate, a standoff with
Bentsen would work to Republican advantage.
   But efforts at advance positioning and control have proven
fruitless in prior presidential debates. This will be the fifth
campaign featuring candidate debates since John F. Kennedy and
Richard M. Nixon faced off seven presidential elections ago. Bush
will be the fourth Republican presidential nominee to debate,
Dukakis the fourth Democrat.

   From the first, they have been styled ``The Great Debates.''
Libraries of briefing books, hours of cram courses and rehearsals
have gone into them. For all of that, they have produced neither
great oratory nor breakthroughs on major issues. Instead, they have
offered televised summations of the standard speeches and positions
the candidates serve up daily in their campaign travels, and some
have turned on mistakes in style or substance.
   The major impact on those campaigns has been one of impressions,
rather than of words. A haggard Nixon, his late-day beard darkening
his cheeks. A fumbling Gerald R. Ford. A defensive Jimmy Carter. A
rambling Ronald Reagan, his age apparently showing.
   Those impressions tended to take shape after the debates, in
reflection rather than in the performance.
   Reagan was 73 during his last re-election campaign. Age became
an issue after an uncharacteristically fumbling TV performance in
Louisville, Ky., against Walter F. Mondale. It never was mentioned
directly in that debate. When it was, in a second debate in Kansas
City, Reagan punctured it with a wisecrack that worked. An age
problem? No, said Reagan, ``I am not going to exploit for political
purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience.''
   The era of the televised debate began in Chicago on Sept. 26,
1960, Nixon versus Kennedy. Nixon, then vice president, held a
narrow lead in the polls, and overruled some of his advisers to
debate the lesser-known Kennedy.
   Nothing either man said counted nearly as much as the way Nixon
looked that night. He'd used powder to cover his beard; it streaked
as he perspired in the hot TV lights. Kennedy looked trim and fit.
Small screen, black and white television magnified the images. That
debate, first of four, gave Kennedy a lasting lift and he won a
hairbreadth election.
   The debates were said to have created a tradition future
candidates surely would follow. None did, for 16 years.
   President Lyndon B. Johnson wasn't interested in giving his
Republican challenger the equal billing of a debate in 1964, when
the polls anticipated his landslide election. Barry Goldwater, the
Republican nominee, excused him in advance, saying a president
shouldn't debate because ``he might just slip and say something
inadvertently that could change the course of history.''
   Nixon was the Republican nominee in 1968 and again in 1972. He
was the favorite and he'd learned his lesson about debating.
   But in 1976, Ford, president by appointment and lagging behind
Carter, needed a jump start for his campaign. He sought it with a
debate challenge. He and Carter met three times, and Ford made one
magnified mistake. In the second debate he said ``There is no
Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a
Ford administration.'' Pressed by a questioner, he insisted on it.
   Eventually he corrected the statement. But it hurt, perhaps not
so much for content as for the way it fit the snide claims of
Ford's critics that he was prone to err and bumble.
   Carter said later that he wouldn't have won without the debates.
   Four years later, Carter was the underdog, pressing for
one-on-one debates with Republican Reagan. They finally met in
Cleveland, one week before the election. That was the night a
relaxed Reagan, in his element, played the long-suffering victim
whenever Carter attacked. ``There you go again,'' he would say.

   Within months, NASA had a new administrator and other top
officials, the directors of three major field centers involved with
the shuttle left, and all those involved in the decision to launch
were replaced.
   There were wholesale resignations and duty changes at Alabama's
Marshall Space Flight Center, which oversees the booster rocket
contract, and at Morton Thiokol Inc. in Utah, which builds the
boosters. NASA established a new safety and quality control office.
   Astronauts and former astronauts were placed in key decision
making positions, as recommended by the commission, to give the
flight crews a larger voice in what was happening.
   Rear Adm. Richard Truly, a former astronaut who made two shuttle
flights, now heads the shuttle program. Robert Crippen, who has
made four flights, now heads a new Mission Management Team and it
will be he who makes the final go-no go decision to launch in the
waning minutes of the countdown.
   Engineers at Marshall and Morton Thiokol redesigned the rocket
joint, adding a third O-ring, better insulation, a heater and a
capture lip to prevent a gap opening under the pressure of ignition.
   NASA also took the time to redesign parts that it said needed
improvement on the orbiter, the external tank and the main engines.
In all, 56 major changes and more than 400 lesser ones have been
made to the vehicle. The program to redesign all three shuttles so
far has cost about $2.4 billion.
   Reagan ordered a replacement shuttle for Challenger, at a cost
of $2.8 billion, and the new craft is starting to take shape at a
Rockwell International facility in California.
   Among the changes to the orbiter is the addition of an emergency
escape system featuring a blowout cabin hatch and a 12-foot
aluminum and steel telescoping pole. The hope is that in case of a
problem during a landing attempt while the shuttle is in gliding
flight, the astronauts could slide down the pole and then parachute
to safety. The system would not be of use in a Challenger-type
accident.
   NASA had hoped to launch Discovery last February, but technical
problems and delays in testing new systems slipped the date to
June, then to August and September.
   Said Forrest S. McCartney, director of the Kennedy Space Center:
``After the Challenger, everyone was encouraged to go back and look
at everything they could think of and see what could be done to
reduce the risk. They did a very thorough and comprehensive job of
that. The stigma of another Challenger is one that everyone is very
conscious of.
   ``So the reason it's taking us so long to get back to flying
again is that we're doing everything we know to reduce risk to the
minimum,'' he said. ``We've initiated more checks and balances than
we ever had before.''

<HEAD>New Engine Not Perfect, But Good Enough To Fly Shuttle Again,
Experts Say</HEAD>

   When NASA engineers set out to develop a new
design for the space shuttle rocket boosters, they had to do it
fast, do it cheap and do it right.
   The result, say most experts, is a rocket that is just short of
the best design possible, but certainly good enough to get America
back into space and keep it there until better rockets are built.
   ``If you started with a clean sheet of paper, there are things
you could do'' to improve the rockets, said Russ Bardos, NASA's
director of shuttle propulsion. But he added: ``I'm perfectly
comfortable with what we have on there now.''
   Space shuttle Discovery stands poised to ride into space before
the end of the month on redesigned solid rocket boosters developed
in a crash program that lasted 31 months, required hundreds of
thousands of man hours and cost the nation $800 million.
   Better rocket engines will be built, said Bardos, but it will
take an additional four to five years and require even more money.
   The redesign program started after the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger
explosion that bared serious problems with the boosters that 24
times previously had sent astronauts into orbit.
   Engineers deep in the structure of NASA had known as early as
1984 that leaking seals on the boosters threatened disaster. A
quiet program to develop a new booster design had been started at
the Marshall Space Flight Center and at Morton Thiokol, the Utah
manufacturer of the rocket.
   In the meantime, NASA expressed confidence in the boosters, and
withheld any concerns from the public and even from the astronauts.
The shuttles kept flying.
   A member of the Rogers Commission, which investigated the
Challenger accident, later described the decision to continue
flying as playing ``Russian roulette'' with a flawed and dangerous
system.
   The game ended when Challenger exploded and seven astronauts
died.
   A new team was named to correct the flawed boosters and some
members of the group later said they were amazed to find how little
data there was about about the internal workings of the rockets.
What appeared to be a simple steel tube filled with propellant was,
in fact, a complex machine.
   ``There was so much we didn't know,'' said Bardos. ``It needed a
lot of design work and changes.''
   The shuttle boosters are the largest solid-fueled rockets ever
made. Two are used to launch the shuttle and each is 149.16 feet
long and 12.17 feet in diameter. Loaded with 1.1 million pounds of
propellant, each boosters weighs 1.3 million pounds and produces
about 3.3 million pounds of thrust at launch, providing more than
two-thirds the lifting power to get the shuttle airborne.
   Because the boosters are so massive, they are manufactured in
four segments. Each of the steel casings are filled with a mixture
of chemicals that cure into a tough, rubber-like solid. The
segments are shipped to the Kennedy Space Center where they are
assembled.
   When the segments come together, they join at what is called a
field joint. It was a failed field joint that leaked and destroyed
Challenger.
   The field joints used for Challenger had a metal lip, called a
tang, that fit into a deep metal groove called a clevis. One side
of the clevis housed two O-rings, or rubberized seals. Bolts held
the clevis and tang together.
   When the propellant was ignited inside the rocket, a pressure of
up to 900 pounds per square inch and temperatures of several
thousand degrees immediately surged against the joint. The surge
was supposed to force the O-rings to seal the joint.
   However, engineers learned early in the shuttle program that the
sudden pressure actually caused the heavy steel casings to balloon
out, an action called ``rotation.'' This caused the joint to open
slightly. If the action was severe enough, the O-rings could lose
their capacity to seal.
   Low temperatures also affected the O-rings. When chilled, the
rubberized material became hard and sealed more slowly.
   When Challenger was launched, the boosters had been chilled by
sub-freezing temperatures overnight. Photos of the launch showed
that superheated gas escaped immediately from the lower field joint
on the right-hand booster. The rocket gases later melted through a
brace to free one end of the shuttle's massive fuel tank. The tank
ruptured and Challenger exploded just 73 seconds after launch.

   NASA engineers already had developed a new joint to correct the
rotation problem. The joint included a metal lip, called a capture
feature, that was added to the inside of the tang. This joint
resembles a handshake, with a new ``thumb'' on the tang giving
extra strength.
   The booster redesign team brought this new joint out of the
laboratory and, with modifications, it became the new field joint.
   The modifications were important. A third O-ring was added.
Heaters were installed to keep the joint temperature at a constant
75 degrees. And a J-shaped slit was formed in insulation coating
the inner surface of the joint. This slit caused pressure to
actually close the joint further, forming still another seal.
   John Thomas, who headed the NASA redesign team, also directed
the redesign of the nozzle-to-case joint of the booster. This joint
had no role in the Challenger disaster, but engineers realized it
might be even more flawed than the field joint.
   The new nozzle joint added another O-ring and a new sealing slit
in the insulation. Thomas, over the objections of some engineers,
also added 100 bolts to further strengthen the nozzle-to-case seal.
   Each element of the new design was tested hundreds of times,
using subscale models or with full-scale joints filled with partial
propellant loads.
   At one point, engineers pressurized water inside the rocket
until the casing burst. Thomas said the test reached twice the
normal operating pressure and none of the joints ever leaked.
   And, finally, five full-scale rocket motors, loaded with more
than a million pounds of propellant, were fired at the Thiokol site
in Utah. In a firing in August, the engineers intentionally cut
insulation and O-ring seals to test how the joints would behave
with assembly flaws. There was not a leak.
   Thomas said early firings revealed some problems that were later
corrected. But there were none, he said, that would endanger an
astronaut crew.
   The massive redesign effort has been closely monitored by an
independent panel of the National Research Council.
   In a report issued Sept. 9, the NRC agreed with Bardos _ the new
rocket is not perfect, but it seems to be good enough.
   ``More might have been accomplished if the program were
unconstrained by the need to return to flight as soon as possible
and by limitations in budget,'' the NRC report said. ``But such
constraints were practical necessities and our impression is that
they were not unreasonable...''
   The new boosters, said the report, have ``enhanced safety and
reliability.'' But it warned: ``Risks remain, however. Whether the
level of risk is acceptable is a matter that NASA must judge.''
   Thomas, Bardos and others said that judgment has been made after
one of the most intense efforts ever mounted by the space agency.
   ``We're ready to fly,'' said Thomas.

<HEAD>Discovery's Primary Task: Deploy $100 Million Satellite</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Besides proving that NASA can fly
astronauts safely again, the first post-Challenger mission's most
important task is to deploy a $100 million communications satellite
to increase the agency's ability to monitor shuttle flights.
   The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, once deployed, will help
ground controllers keep track of shuttles and other unmanned
spacecraft orbiting the Earth. Coverage provided by the TDRS is
more continuous than the space agency's current worldwide network
of ground-based communications tracking systems.
   A similar satellite was deployed in 1983 and is in orbit, but a
nearly identical one was destroyed in the Challenger explosion Jan.
28, 1986.
   Discovery also will be carrying 11 scientific experiments that
lend themselves to being conducted in the weightlessness of space.
Two are projects that were designed by students and were packed
away aboard Challenger before its fatal flight. Another is an
experiment to grow crystals of a protein the AIDS virus uses to
infect human cells. Researchers hope the results will help them
develop better drugs to fight the disease.
   But the satellite is the prime cargo. Its deployment is
important to NASA because it will roughly double the time a shuttle
can be monitored, said Frederick W. Weber, vice president of
Contel's technical services division. The Fairfax, Va.-based Contel
owns and operates the satellite for NASA.
   ``The urgency is to get the second one up there so we can have a
full system,'' Weber said. ``To provide full coverage we need two
spacecraft in orbit.''
   The satellite now in place provides coverage for about 45
percent of a shuttle's orbit. It has had some minor breakdowns but
is still operating at 98 percent capacity, said Jim Elliott, a NASA
spokesman at Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.
   The TDRS relays signals and data between a spacecraft or another
satellite and a ground terminal at White Sands Missile Range, N.M.,
where it then is routed to the appropriate NASA facility.
   Once the second TDRS is up and operating _ scheduled to take
place about two months after deployment _ the two satellites will
be able to relay data equal to a 20-volume encyclopedia in one
second, said Jim Elliott, NASA spokesman at Goddard Space Flight
Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   The TDRS satellite can provide multiple access and support
communications from 26 spacecraft simultaneously.
   Before the first satellite was put in orbit, shuttles had to
communicate with the ground through NASA's network of tracking and
communications stations around the world. Communications were
possible only when the spacecraft's orbit came into the range of an
individual tracking station.
   The TDRS satellite is scheduled to be deployed about six hours
into the mission, although there are five later times it could be
done if problems arise.
   The satellite and an inertial upper stage boooster rocket,
stored in Discovery's cargo bay, will be propelled from the orbiter
into space by a spring-loaded ejection device at a speed of 4
inches per second.
   Later, the satellite is thurst into a higher orbit by the
booster rocket. The booster's first burn is scheduled to take place
an hour after the satellite is deployed and the second and final
burn will follow 5{ hours later. The booster and satellite separate
about 13 hours after launch.
   The satellite, booster and their carrying cradle weigh about
45,000 pounds, making it the heaviest payload to be carried aboard
a shuttle, Johnson Space Center officials said. The satellite
itself weighs about 5,000 pounds, is 57-feet wide and has two
50-pound antennas that look like giant umbrellas.
   The TDRS is to be placed in orbit at 178 degrees West Longitude,
22,300 miles over the Pacific Ocean near the Gilbert Islands. At
that altitude, it will be in what is called geosynchronous orbit,
meaning that it moves with the Earth, always staying in the same
position above the planet.
   The first TDRS satellite, which is over the Atlantic Ocean off
the northeast coast of Brazil, will become an in-orbit spare by the
time four satellite have been deployed early next year.

<HEAD>Major Milestones From Disaster to Resumption of Spaceflight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Since the Challenger accident on Jan. 28, 1986, grounded the
shuttle fleet, there has been a top-to-bottom rebuilding of the
U.S. space program. Here are milestones in the return to
spaceflight:
   
   1986
   
   Jan. 28: Challenger, Flight 51-L _ the 25th shuttle mission _ is
engulfed in a fireball 73 seconds after liftoff. Its crew of seven,
including school teacher Christa McAuliffe, is killed. Within days,
the cause is believed to be a plume of flame escaping from a joint
in the right booster rocket.
   Feb. 3: President Reagan appoints an independent commission,
headed by former secretary of state William P. Rogers, to
investigate.
   Feb. 20: Richard H. Truly, a Navy admiral and former astronaut,
is appointed head of NASA's spaceflight program, the first of a
series of top-level changes in the space agency's management.
   March 7: An underwater search results in the discovery of the
Challenger crew cabin containing the bodies of the astronauts.
   April 18: Titan 34-D, carrying a military payload, explodes five
seconds after launch from Vandenberg AFB, Calif.
   May 3: Delta rocket, carrying a $57 million weather satellite,
loses power 70 seconds after launch, veers out of control, and has
to be destroyed. It is the third straight launch failure of the
U.S. space program.
   May 15: Arnold Aldrich, manager of the shuttle system, tells
Congress that target date for next launch _ that of Discovery _ is
July 15, 1987.
   May 30: An Ariane-2 rocket fails and the West is left without
launch capacity.
   June 9: The Rogers commission blames the disaster on a leak
through a faulty seal in Challenger's right booster that allowed
hot gases to breach the fuel tank. The bottom booster-tank
attachment gave way, hydrogen streamed from the failed tank and the
shuttle was enveloped in a fireball. The commission criticizes
NASA's launch decision, its internal communications breakdowns and
a history of overlooking problems with the boosters.
   June 17: Jane's Spaceflight Directory says the Soviets hold an
``almost frightening'' lead in space over the United States.
   June 19: NASA announces one of the first of many changes
affecting its cargo schedule, dropping plans to use the liquid-fuel
Centaur rocket for interplanetary launches from the shuttle.
   July 14: NASA administrator James C. Fletcher announces February
1988 as new date for resumption of manned flights, blames delay on
difficulties in redesigning the booster.
   July 16: Lawrence B. Mulloy, a key NASA official involved in the
Challenger launch decision, retires rather than accept a transfer
within the agency.
   July 28: NASA discloses the Challenger crew used three of the
air packs aboard, indicating some remained conscious after the
shuttle disintegrated.
   Aug. 12: NASA announces new booster rocket design, using a third
O-ring seal and latching feature.
   Aug. 15: Reagan gives OK to building a replacement for
Challenger and tells NASA to carry no more commercial satellites,
in order to build private launch industry.
   Sept. 5: A Delta rocket, carrying an SDI payload, is launched
successfully from Cape Canaveral.
   Nov. 5: Aldrich, one of the few officials involved with the
Challenger launch still at the space agency, is named No. 2 man in
the shuttle program. Program controls are pulled into headquarters
in major reorganization.
   Dec. 29: Four of the astronaut families agree to settle all
potential claims against government. The amount is disclosed 14
months later to be $7.7 million total, with Morton Thiokol
contributing $4.6 million.
   
   1987
   
   Jan. 9: The 5-man crew of STS-26, the first post-Challenger
mission, is named. Frederick H. Hauck, 45, is the commander.
   Jan. 14: The National Research Council reports NASA can't safely
meet Feb. 18, 1988, launch target.
   Jan. 20: NASA says it will put escape hatches on the shuttle.
   Feb. 5: Jesse Moore, who gave final approval for Challenger
launch, resigns from NASA.
   March 26: An Atlas-Centaur rocket, one of two remaining, is
launched during electrical storm at Cape Canaveral, goes out of
control, and is destroyed along with military communications
satellite it is carrying.
   April 21: NASA announces it can't meet Feb. 18, 1988, launch
target.
   May 6: Jane Smith, widow of Challenger pilot Michael Smith,
files $1.5 billion suit against government, Morton Thiokol and
Mulloy.
   May 17: Fletcher announces a mixed-fleet plan to acquire
expendable rockets to lessen dependence on the shuttle for
satellite launches.
   May 20: NASA schedules first post-Challenger flight for June
1988.
   June 15: General Dynamics is the first company to enter the
private launch business by announcing it will build 18
Atlas-Centaurs over five years.
   Aug. 30: The redesigned booster rocket is tested successfully at
Morton Thiokol's Utah facility.
   Sept. 15: Arianespace has first successful launch in 16 months.
   Oct. 26: Air Force launches its first Titan 34D since same type
of rocket blew up April 18, 1986. It carries a secret payload,
probably a spy satellite.
   Nov. 23: National Research Council recommends additional testing
of solid-fuel rocket, which might require postponing June launch.
   Dec. 23: A part of the redesigned shuttle booster rocket motor
breaks off during test firing.
   Dec. 29: NASA says it can't meet June 2 Discovery flight date
because of booster test failure.

won't be before Aug. 14.
   May 4: Explosions level the plant of Pacific Engineering in
Henderson, Nev., one of two U.S. makers of ammonium perchlorate, a
key component in the shuttle boosters. With only four flight sets
of boosters on hand, NASA worries whether there will be enough fuel
to meet 1989 flight schedule.

reported.
   The Commerce Department said the merchandise trade gap shrank to
$9.53 billion in July from a revised June deficit of $13.22 billion.
   The Reagan administration lost no time in hailing the huge

   The Federal Reserve reported Wednesday that the August increase,
the 11th consecutive month without a decline, followed a revised 1
percent July advance, which had been the strongest showing since
last October.
   The August increase was in line with expectations and analysts

   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
has told Congress he sees no need for a blanket ban on mergers of
the biggest banks and securities firms, but is going along with
such a ban in order to win passage of legislation permitting banks
to underwrite securities.
   Greenspan said Wednesday that he and fellow Fed governors ``see
no threat to the system if those (merger) activities were to take
place.''
   But he said they did not believe it was wise to press the issue
for fear of hurting chances for repealing the Glass-Steagall Act,
which separated commercial from investment banking in 1933.

drought in the nation's farm belt came to an end, according to a
private research group.
   The Conference Board, a business-financed non-profit group, said
Wednesday its Consumer Confidence Index climbed to 119.2 in August,
up nearly 6 points from July and 3.5 points from June.
   The monthly survey, which covers 5,000 U.S. households, is
conducted for the board by National Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo,
Ohio.
   ``The strong increase in consumer confidence was largely due to
a better mood in America's farm belt,'' said Fabian Linden,
executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center.
   Linden said improved weather conditions and government support
payments to affected farmers led to last month's gains.
   ``Confidence also is up in the rest of the nation, spurred by
the continuing vigor of the economy,'' he said.
   The survey found that more people said they planned to buy homes
and major appliances last month than in July. Some 4.1 percent had
home-buying plans in August, up from 3.5 percent in July, and 34
percent planned a major appliance purchase, compared with 30
percent in July.
   However, less people were planning to buy a car, dropping to 7.2
percent last month from 8.9 percent in July.
   The survey found that 32 percent of consumers polled thought
business was ``good,'' up from 28 percent in July. Nearly 22
percent felt the the economy would get better, compared with 20
percent the previous month.
   In addition, 20 percent of those surveyed thought jobs would
increase in the next six months, up from 18 percent in July.

<HEAD>U.S. Oil Production Continues Decline In August</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. oil production declined again in August and
imports remained strong as uncertainty over prices left little
incentive for boosting domestic output, according to the American
Petroleum Institute.
   Meanwhile, deliveries of refined petroleum products rose 2.2
percent from a year earlier, the largest yearly increase since the
first three months of the year, the trade group said Wednesday.
   Refineries reached 88 percent of capacity, the highest monthly
utilization rate in nearly 10 years.
   Some analysts said the surprising number in the trade group's
monthly report was the healthy 11.7 percent increase in deliveries
of distillate fuel oil, which includes home heating oil and diesel
fuel, despite the severe summer drought in the nation's midsection.
Analysts said much of the demand was channeled into inventories and
not consumed.
   Deliveries of gasoline rose 1.3 percent and of kerosine jet fuel
0.8 percent last month, while residual fuel oil deliveries fell 2.6
percent, the report said.
   Crude oil production averaged 8.1 million barrels a day, 0.8
percent less than the 8.2 million barrels produced daily in August
1987.
   Alaskan daily production remained near the 2 million barrel
level it has held since late last year, but production in the lower
48 states declined about 175,000 barrels a day from a year ago and
more than 1.1 million from early 1986, the report said.
   ``The lower crude oil prices and increased price uncertainty of
the past several months have no doubt reduced the amount of well
servicing that is economic to undertake,'' the trade group said.
   The partial recovery in well servicing that began last year
appears to be eroding, the report said, with only about half of the
wells restored following the 1986 oil price crash.
   ``When you're getting $16 to $18 for oil, you can't put as much
enhanced recovery investment into servicing,'' said Bob Baker, an
analyst with Prudential Bache Securities Inc.
   Although imports declined between 3 percent and 5 percent in the
last two months, lower production and higher consumption have
pushed imports up more than 500,000 barrels a day over the last
eight months as a whole.
   The trade group said total inventories, which include crude oil
and its refined products, were up 0.2 percent in August from July
and up 1.6 percent from a year earlier.
   Residual fuel oil inventories were down 3.5 percent compared to
last month and 15.1 percent lower than a year ago.
   Crude oil stocks were down 5.3 percent compared to July and down
0.8 percent from August 1987.

<HEAD>Lobster Pound To Test Nationwide TV Sales Venture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JONESPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With Maine's rockbound coast in the
background, Captain Owen Beal hauls a trap over the side of his
lobster boat and makes his pitch to television viewers in a thick
Down East accent.
   ``You can have your lobster within 24 hours from Maine's clear,
cool ocean waters,'' says Beal, in a 60-second spot scheduled to
debut within the next month on cable TV stations in various major
U.S. markets.
   Beal, clad in a yellow slicker, tells viewers that all they have
to do is dial a toll-free telephone number if they want ``the
tastiest lobsters in the world'' on their dinner table.
   The ads will mark a 30-day trial of what is billed as the first
television sales and distribution network to guarantee home or
office delivery of live Maine lobsters anywhere in the nation
within 24 hours.
   The venture represents a merger of modern high-tech
telemarketing systems and a 75-year-old lobster pound operated in
this small eastern Maine fishing village by Sidney Look, the fourth
Look generation to run the business.
   The idea originated two years ago when Ed Dugay of Cherryfield,
a pilot who flies spotter planes for herring fishermen, brought
Maine products such as lobsters, blueberries and sardines as gifts
on a visit to his brother in Nashville, Tenn.
   ``He's involved in a lot of telemarketing,'' Dugay said of his
brother, Mike, and ``a lightbulb went on.'' The two brothers hit
upon the TV marketing plan and approached Look with it.
   ``It's a great marriage really. Sid has three lobster pounds and
a lot of inventory, and we're kind of acting as consultants,''
Dugay said Wednesday.
   Operators in Dallas will process telephone orders and feed them
into a computer. Between midnight and dawn, the data will be
transmitted along telephone lines to a recently-installed bank of
computers on the second floor of Look's shingled packing house at
the end of a wharf.
   At the start of the workday, the orders are printed out and the
lobsters are packed. At the same time, credit card numbers debit
customers' accounts and copies of the orders appear on the main
Federal Express computer in Memphis, Tenn.
   A truck arrives at 4 p.m. to pick up the lobsters, which are
shipped from Bangor International Airport before sunset.
   Launching the business from this village of 1,200 in a remote
section of the Maine coast forced the Dugays to overcome some
hurdles. Overnight shippers had no daily Federal Express service to
Jonesport before the inauguration of Look's Lobster Line.
   Likewise, Jonesport had no touch-tone phones, relying on rotary
dials or communication through an operator. Because computers
require touch-tone systems, Dugay had to add a conversion device to
the modem linking his phone line to the computer.
   Dugay says the markets for the initial ads still are being
selected, but he expects Denver and Chicago to be among them. The
minimum order will be for six, 1-pound to 1\-pound lobsters, at a
total cost of $89, plus $10 for shipping and handling.
   If the lobster line proves successful, Dugay says he is prepared
to offer other eastern Maine products, including quahogs, mussels
and blueberries.

<HEAD>Inventories and Incentives Color 10-Day Sales Figures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early September sales of domestically-made cars
and trucks were down by 9 percent from a year earlier, according to
automakers, but analysts say last year's incentives and reports of
relatively low inventories in 1988 make year-to-year sales
comparisons difficult.
   The companies reported Wednesday they sold 243,337 vehicles
during the Sept. 1-10 sales period this year, compared with 267,397
vehicles during the same period last year. There were eight selling
days in both periods.
   ``There is so much noise in the data that it's not a terribly
meaningful comparison, this year vs. last year,'' said Mary Ann
Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. of New York.
   During early September 1987, dealers were in the thick of
incentive battles, offering such enticements as 1.9 percent
financing and cash rebates to get buyers into showrooms and reduce
bulging inventories.
   ``In addition, in the last report on inventories the industry
was down a shade below 60 days,'' Sudol said. ``It could be that
there are scattered shortages in the showrooms.''
   For the early September period, car sales fell 12.6 percent to
155,131 this year, compared with 177,512 during the period last
year. There were 1.9 percent fewer trucks sold during the period
this year compared with last year _ 88,206 vs. 89,885.
   Analyst Ron Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. of San
Francisco said despite the coloring that last year's incentives put
on sales comparisons, sales appeared to be strong.
   ``Sales are pretty decent,'' he said. ``The sales are at the
same rate they were last month.''
   General Motors Corp. showed the largest decline in early
September sales, an 18 percent drop, falling to 74,640 cars during
the period this year compared with 91,075 cars during early
September 1987.
   Ford Motor Co. sales fell 11.6 percent to 45,318 cars from
51,243 during the same period last year. Chrysler Corp.'s decline
was 10.2 percent, to 20,357 in early September from 22,659 a year
ago.
   Chrysler had some of the biggest incentives during the August
and September last year.
   Honda of America Manufacturing Inc. showed a 41.3 percent
increase to 9,660 cars early this month from 6,835 during the same
period last year, but a dealer sales drive may have something to do
with that, Glantz said.
   ``Dealers have a sales push going on in order to be eligible for
larger quotas in the new model year,'' he said.
   For the year to date, automakers reported sales of about 8.4
million U.S.-made vehicles, 7.1 percent more than the 7.8 million
sold through Sept. 10 last year. There were 214 sales days through
Sept. 10 of this year, one more than the same time last year, so
the percentage change was for the daily sales rate.

<HEAD>Harvard Raising $30 Million for Companies To Commercialize
Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A complex scheme by Harvard University
to share in profits from the research findings of its faculty
members poses an ethical obstacle course for the university,
academics say.
   Harvard's decision to seek $30 million for companies to
commercialize the school's medical research comes eight years after
the university scrapped a plan to co-invest in a professor's work
after the agreement was deemed ethically dangerous.
   Phillip Sharp, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology biology
professor who in 1978 helped found Biogen Inc., one of the first
biotechnology start-up companies, said Wednesday that Harvard needs
``lots of walls'' to guarantee that the lure of forming companies
does not impede faculty and research decisions.
   ``Does Harvard's financial expectation in starting new ventures
have a risk in influencing what goes on in terms of their search
for truth and new research?'' Sharp asked. ``If that relationship
is too strong, then it has the potential of influencing who Harvard
recruits as faculty.''
   Harvard said the new program safely distances the university
from deciding what research would be marketed.
   ``There is by definition no conflict because Harvard is not the
decision maker as to where the investments would be made,'' said
Harvard Vice President John Shattuck.
   Under the plan, Harvard would raise money from six to eight
outside corporate investors to develop health care businesses under
a limited partnership called Medical Science Partners. That
partnership would be run by another limited partnership headed by
Andre L. Lamotte, a former drug industry executive, and Ion Inc., a
Harvard subsidiary.
   Harvard would get 10 percent of any company profits, which would
be reinvested in medical research.
   Administrators said the new scheme would raise sorely needed
money to supplement Harvard Medical School's $350 million research
budget and speed up development of medical innovations.
   The new investment structure, formally established this month,
differs from those at other universities because Harvard is
involved directly in raising the money used to start up the
companies.
   Most research universities have licensing offices that patent
and market professors' work through existing companies and then
divide royalties among the university, the department and the
professor.
   Stanford University last year earned $9.1 million through
licensing fees, tops in the nation, while MIT made about $3
million. Washington University in St. Louis has a 50-50 agreement
with an outside venture capitalist who selects research with
commercial promise.
   ``We don't co-invest with our faculty in new companies because
that could raise potential conflicts if you invest in Professor A
but not in Professor B,'' Stanford spokesman Bob Beyers said.
``Let's say Professor A gets a bigger lab or higher salary or more
graduate students. There are problems there.''
   Faculty members stand to receive research support in the Harvard
deal. They are not required to use the fund to market their work.
University conflict of interest guidelines urge scientists not to
compromise their research and teaching activities in relationships
with industry, including the fund.
   ``The big difference is they're creating that very large fund
that there's going to be pressure to invest in good research,''
said Edward MacCordy, associate vice chancellor for research at
Washington University.
   ``The key to look at is what influence on the inventor is there
going to be,'' he said. ``If the inventor still pursues the
research he wants to pursue and has the alternative of seeking
support for that anywhere he wants to, then there's no impact.''
   Shattuck said the limited partnership would be run directly by
Lamotte, a former executive with the U.S. affiliate of the French
drug company Merieux. Harvard Medical School recruited Lamotte, who
would negotiate with the medical school for rights to researchers'
work.
   ``He comes to Harvard to seek to patent and purchase discoveries
just as anyone else would,'' Shattuck said. ``It is an arm's length
relationship with Medical Science Partners.''
   In 1980, Harvard agreed to form a company along with biochemist
Mark Ptashne and take about 15 percent ownership share but backed
out after university President Derek Bok said the risk of judging
researchers based on the marketability of their work was too great.
   Ptashne, who still is at Harvard, found outside venture capital
sources to form Genetics Institute Inc.
   Many present biotechnology firms also were founded by professors
who realized a lucrative market for transferring technology from
the lab to the marketplace since the early 1980s. One example is
Genentech Inc. of San Francisco, formed by University of California
professors.

Business</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $1.3 billion plan to split Playtex
Holdings Inc. into two companies will enable each one to focus on
their own areas of business, while giving a big return to investors
who bought Playtex in 1986, says Chairman Joel E. Smilow.
   On Wednesday, the Stamford-based company said it would divide
into two separate companies under a series of buyout transactions
led by two groups each headed by Smilow.
   The deal would separate Playtex' family products businesses from
its intimate apparel operations, allowing their respective
managements to operate more independently of each other.
   The group led by Smilow, members of Playtex Holdings management
and Thomas H. Lee Co., a Boston-based investment firm, agreed to
pay $9.60 in cash and $1 in face value of a new issue of preferred
stock for each of the company's 50 million outstanding,
privately-held common shares, a total of about $530 million.
   The Smilow-Lee group also will acquire or redeem Playtex
Holdings' outstanding debt and preferred stock worth $770 million.
   A second group, led by Smilow and members of Playtex Apparel
Products Inc. management, then would acquire that business for $380
million in cash.
   Smilow said the deal does several things including give ``a
wonderful return'' to shareholders, who invested about $10 million
to acquire Playtex in 1986, and creating two separate companies,
each focused on their own areas of business.
   Playtex Holdings acquired the businesses of International
Playtex Inc. from subsidiaries of BCI Holdings Inc. in a $1.25
billion leveraged buy-out on Dec. 12, 1986, retaining Playtex'
intimate apparel and family products businesses while selling its
cosmetic and fragrance units for $350 million.
   The company last year made an aborted attempt to sell its family
products division, which makes products such as Playtex tampons, to
Johnson & Johnson Inc. for $726 million.
   Management owns 28 percent of Playtex Holdings stock, with the
rest held by institutional investors, BCI Holdings and the
investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Playtex Holdings had 1987 sales of $614.4 million, including
$310.4 million from the intimate apparel division. Overall
operating profit was $154.8 million, including $46.4 million from
intimate apparel.
   Smilow, who also is Playtex' chief executive and president, said
the sale of the apparel business would allow Playtex Holdings to
concentrate on its family products and hair care businesses. It
also would allow management of the separate businesses to operate
more independently of each other, while keeping current top
management, namely Smilow and vice chairman Hercules Sotos, in
command.
   After the transactions, management will own 40 percent to 50
percent of the family products group and 100 percent of the apparel
business, Smilow said.
   The transactions are subject to the execution of definitive
agreements, finalizing financing arrangements and obtaining any
necessary approvals.
   Thomas E. Lee Co. is a Boston-based private investment firm
specializing in leveraged transactions and has participated in more
than 60 management buy-outs.

<HEAD>Alcoa White-Collar Workers To Participate In Profit-Sharing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Aluminum Company of America says a
profit-sharing plan involving 7,000 white-collar employees in
domestic aluminum operations will go into effect this year, a move
opposed by the United Steelworkers union.
   Officials of the Pittsburgh-based company said Wednesday that
the plan would create a profit-sharing pool when the company's U.S.
operations exceed a return of 6 percent on assets. Employees would
share 17 percent of profits above that threshold, they said.
   Alcoa officials said individual payouts would vary with profits
and the number of employees involved. The plan is retroactive to
Jan. 1, the company said.
   Alcoa said the payout could amount to about 7 percent of each
employee's base salary if second-half 1988 profits equal first-half
profits.
   In contract talks three weeks ago, the company offered a
profit-sharing plan to union employees that would amount to up to
$1,300 for blue-collar workers, based on Alcoa's expected 1988
profits.
   The United Steelworkers said it rejected the plan as inadequate
and said it opposed the company's plan to extend it to white-collar
workers.
   On Aug. 24, the USW and the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers
unions broke off early contract negotiations with Alcoa after
rejecting offers that included profit-sharing, an immediate
ratification bonus, lump sum bonuses annually, an improved medial
insurance option and increased pension benefits.
   USW negotiator George Becker said the talks ended because Alcoa
would not address several key issues, including wage and pension
increases.
   The unions sought new contracts to recover concessions
negotiated in 1986, when the aluminum industry faced difficult
economic times.

<HEAD>Auditors Find Huge Amounts Of Financial Irregularities</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China's state auditors in the past five years
uncovered more than $10.8 billion in financial irregularities,
including widespread misuse and embezzlement of public funds, an
official daily said today.
   The China Daily said the nation's 50,000 auditors, who were
commissioned in 1983, found the state treasury lost about $2.8
billion as a result of improper handling of funds.
   It said that in checks of 8,000 schools and 2,000 government
offices involved in education, funds totaling $113.5 million were
diverted into non-educational uses.
   Poverty relief funds amounting to $48 million were misused or
embezzled in 995 counties and 700 export-oriented firms evaded
taxes or otherwise carried out malpractices equal to $183.7 million.
   An investigation of 12 hotel projects in Beijing found that $62
million was raised illegally.
   The report said auditors had saved the state $270 million in the
past two years by preventing money from being spent on unnecessary

   Directors of the Washington Public Power
Supply System were upbeat about building two nuclear plants even as
they secretly discussed abandoning the billion-dollar projects, the
jury in the WPPSS fraud trial has been told.
   ``We claim, and we will prove, that these false statements were
made fraudulently, intentionally, recklessly and negligently,''
said one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs, Tom Barr, during
opening arguments Wednesday.
   Attorneys for the 19 defendants were expected to make opening
arguments today in the lawsuit over WPPSS' $2.25 billion default in
1983 after halting the projects. It's the largest default in
municipal bond market history.
   The defendants deny fraud claims, saying poor judgment may have
been used, but that WPPSS and defendant utilities hired expert
advisers and acted in what they believed were Northwest power
consumers' best interests.
   The U.S. District Court trial, moved here from Washington state
due to pretrial publicity, is expected to take months.
   Attorney Paul Bernstein, representing some of the 24,000 bond
buyers who sued, told the 20 jurors Wednesday they would hear tapes
of WPPSS directors behind closed doors talking about terminating
the plant projects in early 1980.
   Bernstein said that Don Clayhold, a utility official who was a
WPPSS director, was taped saying, ``If we scrapped the projects, we
probably wouldn't be able to pay off the debts.''
   Another WPPSS director, the late William Hulbert, said shutting
the plants ``would break every small utility in the Northwest,''
Bernstein told the jury.
   But the same directors, talking to a representative of the bond
agency Moody's, painted a bright enough picture of the projects
that WPPSS retained its A-plus rating, he said.
   Barr said the utilities that oversaw WPPSS made promises in
official bond statements that they never intended to keep. Barr
represented Chemical Bank of New York, which sued on behalf of the
24,000 bond buyers.
   The defendants are 16 Washington state utilities, all of them
WPPSS directors, two engineering firms and a financial adviser to
WPPSS. Seven other utilities settled out of court with the
plaintiffs.
   WPPSS was formed in 1957 by public utilities to build and
operate major electric plants in Washington, Idaho and Oregon.
   In the 1970s, it embarked on an ambitious plan to build five
nuclear plants, but was plagued by cost overruns and delays. Only
one plant was completed and is operating.
   Barr said Wednesday the defendant utilities claimed there was a
need for more electricity in the Northwest when there was not, and
continually changed estimates of what building plant Nos. 4 and 5
would cost.
   Had the projects been honestly represented, he said, WPPSS would
never have been welcomed at the bond market.
   Barr said the utilities soon realized after construction of the
two plants had begun that they had acted recklessly. But, he said,
they went ahead in the belief that the federal Bonneville Power
Administration would assume debts for the plants, as it had done
for WPPSS plant Nos. 1, 2 and 3.
   That would have reduced the utilities' obligation by two-thirds,
he said.
   Barr noted that in the first of 14 bond sales, in 1977, the
plants' cost was estimated at $3.37 billion. By mid-1981, the cost
had jumped to $11.8 billion and dates for completing that plants
had slipped several years.
   Barr said the utilities' ultimate ``ace up the sleeve'' was to
litigate their way out of their predicament.
   ``They intended first to go to court and to get their state
courts to get them out of their promises,'' he said, adding that
that strategy worked.
   In 1983, the Washington Supreme Court ruled that utilities that
had signed contracts with WPPSS for construction of plants 4 and 5
lacked authority to make those agreements. The court said the
utilities could not obligate customers to pay for plants that might
never be built.

<HEAD>Judge Allows Partial Merger of Detroit Newspapers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM IRWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents have promised to appeal a federal court
decision upholding the partial merger of the Detroit Free Press and
Detroit News under a joint operating agreement approved last month
by then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   In a ruling Wednesday, U.S. District Judge George Revercomb
rejected contentions by a group of Detroit advertisers and readers
that the morning Free Press, owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., was not a
failing newspaper entitled to antitrust exemptions under the 1970
Newspaper Preservation Act.
   The judge said he would allow a month-old court order
temporarily blocking the deal to expire at 7:15 p.m. on Saturday.
   But David C. Vladeck, a lawyer who represented Michigan Citizens
for an Independent Press, said the group planned to appeal
Revercomb's decision and would ask the appeals court to extend the
stay blocking the partial merger.
   The group claims the agreement would result in higher prices,
unnecessary job losses and diminished journalistic quality. Its
case was argued in Washington by Public Citizen, a consumer group
founded by Ralph Nader.
   ``We feel the arguments we've already made are very
persuasive,'' said William Schultz, a lawyer for Public Citizen.
``We feel it's a very strong, case and we have a very good chance
in the Court of Appeals.''
   Officials of the Detroit Newspaper Agency, which would oversee
the two newspapers' combined operations, were scheduled to meet
today in Washington to decide whether to enact the agreement before
an appeals court heard the case, the Free Press reported.
   Revercomb had dismissed in Wednesday's ruling contentions that
Meese ``arbitrarily and capriciously'' ignored findings by the
Justice Department's antitrust division and an administrative law
judge that the dailies did not qualify for a joint operating
agreement.
   ``The court finds that the attorney general was not unreasonable
in finding that the Free Press _ a newspaper that has incurred and
will continue to incur losses that would already have led to its
demise were it not owned by a large corporate parent _ is a failing
newspaper,'' the judge wrote in a 17-page opinion.
   David Lawrence, publisher of the Free Press, said in a
statement: ``This is a good day for the future of the Free Press. I
can only hope that the pain and uncertainty of the past almost 2{
years will be over before too long.''
   Knight-Ridder had threatened to close the Free Press if the
joint operating agreement was not approved.
   The consolidation of the two newspapers' business, advertising,
circulation and production departments would result in layoffs of
between 600 and 800 employees _ compared with 2,200 if the Free
Press shut down.
   The Free Press has lost $100 million in the last nine years and
the afternoon News, purchased by Gannett Co. Inc. in 1986, has also
sustained significant operating losses in the last decade.
   According to the Audit Bureau of Circulation, the Free Press had
a daily circulation last year of 638,720 daily compared with The
News' 678,720. On Sundays, The News held a slightly larger lead _
839,319 to 724,342.

<HEAD>Board of Trade Commodities Trader Convicted in Disguise Scam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury has convicted a former member of
the Chicago Board of Trade on charges that he and three others used
a wig and other disguises to make illegal trades worth $308,000.
   Thompson B. Sanders was found guilty of 11 counts of conspiracy,
wire and commodities fraud and interstate transportation of stolen
property. He faces as much as 55 years in prison and $1.3 million
in fines at his Nov. 3 sentencing by U.S. District Court Judge
Marvin D. Aspen.
   But Sanders, who did not testify in his own defense, said he
would appeal the conviction.
   ``Maybe it was a mistake not taking the stand,'' he told
reporters outside the courtroom. ``I thought there was enough
evidence standing by itself that I'd be found not guilty.''
   The charges stem from four trades of U.S. government bond
futures at the CBOT in 1986.
   The government charged that Sanders and three accomplices _ Dan
Dewey, Dan Kolton and David Pelleu, all of whom pleaded guilty to
one count of each of conspiracy and wire fraud _ participated in a
scheme in which Dewey wore a wig and used fake credentials to gain
access to the U.S. Treasury bond trading pit at the CBOT.
   Once in the pit, Dewey set in motion four trades that allowed
the four to pocket $308,000 in profits. Prosecutors said the scheme
allowed the four to walk away from bad trades while claiming
profits from good ones.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Plunges In July; Report Cheers Markets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Retail sales declined last month, providing further evidence
that the economy is slowing and inflation pressures are easing.
   The Commerce Department reported today that retail sales
declined 0.2 percent, or $330 million, to a seasonally adjusted
$133.5 billion in August, pulled down by the sharpest drop in auto
sales in 10 months.
   Sales of women's apparel and furniture also declined while food
and gasoline sales were up slightly, the government said.
   Many economists said the report indicated that growth in
consumer demand has slowed.
   Meanwhile, the lowest monthly merchandise trade deficit since
December 1984 has encouraged financial markets that the United
States is on the way to solving its trade imbalance.
   The Commerce Department's report Wednesday that the trade
deficit fell to $9.53 billion in July from a revised $13.22 billion
in June was considered significant because it included a big drop
in imports.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed
17.60 to 2,100.64 on Wednesday, closing above 2,100 for the first
time since it stood at 2,107.40 on Aug. 8. Bond prices rose
modestly and the dollar rallied.
   A decline in the nation's demand for imports could mean the
economy is cooling off somewhat, which would reduce pressure on
interest rates. The prospect for lower rates is good for the stock
and bond markets.
   Lower rates could be bad for the dollar by reducing the returns
on dollar-denominated assets. But the dollar rose, apparently
because the drop in the deficit indicated the dollar did not need
to weaken much to help erode the trade deficit.
   The dollar's rise occurred despite the Federal Reserve's
attempts to restrain it.
   Good news on trade preceded a leap in oil prices, triggered by
mounting concern that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries would succeed in cutting its oil production.
   After touching a nearly two-year low last week, the near-month
contract for West Texas Intermediate has soared about $1.65 a
barrel, rising 84 cents on Wednesday to $15.40 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   In a second report Wednesday, the government said industrial
output rose a moderate 0.2 percent in August, pushing production up
a healthy 5.3 percent over a year ago. Much of this gain reflects
the boom in export sales that American companies have enjoyed.
   In other economic news Wednesday:
   _Sales of U.S.-made cars and trucks fell 9 percent in early
September, according to figures automakers released Wednesday, but
changes in incentives made the figures difficult to compare with
those of a year earlier.
   _The Conference Board, a private research group, said consumers
felt more confident about the economy last month than in the
previous two months after a devastating drought in the nation's
farm belt came to an end.

<HEAD>Iraq Says It Won't Lower Oil Output; Might Increase Production</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto, one name, is correct</NOTE>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq will not agree to lower its output of oil
even if other OPEC members ask and may even increase production,
the country's oil minister said in an interview published Thursday.
   The minister, Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, told the Al-Watan
newspaper that Iraq would not rule out increasing its output from
2.7 million barrels a day as part of an effort to rebuild its
shattered economy after eight years of war with Iran.
   Iraq has refused to abide by a quota of 1.5 million barrels a
day set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
because its Persian Gulf enemy has been allowed to produce 2.3
million barrels a day.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto has held talks with several
members of the cartel recently, including Iran, who are opposed to
raising Iraq's official quota to parity with Iran.
   However, the newspaper Thursday said Chalabi's latest statements
indicate Baghdad no longer is interested in gaining parity with
Iran or in accepting any assigned quota.
   ``We sacrificed and lost a lot in the eight years of hostilities
during which we could not produce our output quota,'' the minister
was quoted as saying.
   ``Therefore, we are not prepared to sacrifice more as we now
have our construction commitments and debt which we should repay.''
   The minister declined to estimate by how much Iraq might
increase its oil exports, saying it would ``depend to a large
extent on the state of our ports.''
   ``But our output will be larger when the second stage of the
Iraqi-Saudi pipeline is completed in September 1989,'' he said.
   The pipeline to the Red Sea and another via Turkey to the
Mediterranean were oil export outlets Iraq used after its ports
were damaged and shipments through the gulf blocked by the war.
   Oil prices have risen sharply in recent days after a steady
decline in previous weeks prompted by fears of a world oversupply
of oil. The sharp rise in prices started Monday was fueled by
reports suggesting that OPEC could be closer to limiting production.
   Chalabi dismissed as ``baseless'' charges that Iraq was
responsible for the overall decline in oil prices, saying: ``Iraqi
production did not change whereas oil prices dropped by 30
percent.''
   OPEC is producing at least 3.5 million barrels a day more than
its self-imposed collective quota of 15 million barrels. Crude is
selling between $14 and $15.50 a barrel on world markets. OPEC's
benchmark price is $18.
   The New York-based Petroleum Intelligence Weekly reported in
August that Iraq was exporting 500,000 barrels of oil a day to the
United States.
   Chalabi said that talk of a U.S. embargo of Iraqi oil because of
Iraq's alleged use of chemical weapons against Turkish refugees did
not worry him.
   ``Iraq will be able to find markets for selling its oil, and
consequently our oil exports will not be affected by any embargo,''
Chalabi said.

   Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A. says prices on all
but two of its 1989 models will be 3.2 percent more on average than
comparably equipped 1988 models.
   The 1989 prices released Wednesday do not include its luxury
Maxima car and four-wheel-drive Pathfinder vehicle. Prices for
those models will be released next month, the company said.
   Nissan Vice President and General Manager Robert Thomas said the
increases were caused by economic conditions and product
improvements.
   The company did not release a model-by-model price breakdown,
but said its new 240SX, which goes on sale Monday, will have a base
price of $12,999.

   The stock market was mixed today in an
ambivalent response to new signs of a slowing economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.13 to 2,102.77 in
the first half hour.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 357 up, 465 down and
557 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 18.42 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that retail sales
declined 0.2 percent in August, after a downward-revised 0.1
percent increase in July.
   That buttressed recent evidence that economic growth has slowed
since midyear, apparently taking some of the pressure off the
Federal Reserve to try to restrain the pace of expansion.
   But analysts said investors weren't inclined to commit
themselves heavily to stocks, in part because interest-bearing
investments still offer high yields relative to inflation and to
prospective returns on stocks.
   Hospital Corp. of America was delayed in opening following word
that members of its top management proposed a leveraged buyout at
about $47 a share.
   Other hospital management stocks moved up in sympathy. National
Medical Enterprises rose 1\ to 21| and American Medical
International was up | at 16{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.10 to 152.23. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .12 at 298.23.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 17.60 to
2,100.64, closing above 2,100 for the first time since it stood at
2,107.40 on Aug. 8.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 on the

   Big Board volume totaled 177.22 million shares, against 162.49

   Oil futures prices were lower in early trading
today as support factors that strengthened the market in recent
days began to fade.
   Speculation that Hurricane Gilbert would temporarily disrupt
gasoline supplies along the Gulf of Mexico coast had fueled a surge
in energy prices since Monday.
   But early indications today suggested the hurricane might not
disrupt oil and gasoline supplies to the extent previously thought.
   ``People are afraid the hurricane is not going to slam into the
refineries afterall,'' said Peter Beutel, an analyst with Elders
Futures Inc.
   In addition, statements that Iraq would not lower its oil output
and instead might raise production also dampened prices, analysts
said.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale unleaded gasoline
for October delivery was trading about 1.57 cents lower at around
45.45 cents a gallon shortly after the market opened. Gasoline had
soared 3.21 cents a gallon on Wednesday to settle at 47.02 cents on
top of a 1.19 cents rise in Tuesday's session.
   The October wholesale heating oil contract was down about 1.22
cents at 42.85 cents a gallon after rising 2.24 cents a gallon to
settle at 44.07 cents Wednesday.
   The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, was lower, trading between $15.03 and 15.18 a
gallon today. On Wednesday, it soared 84 cents a barrel to close at
$15.40 and trading volume was 160,363 contracts, the highest since
a record 175,383 contracts were traded last Dec. 17.
   On Monday, crude prices had plunged briefly to $13.75, nearly a
two-year low, before rebounding and have generally moved higher
since then.
   The price boosts stemmed partly from speculation that Hurricane
Gilbert, which is approaching the Gulf coast, would disrupt
gasoline output at refineries along the Texas-Louisiana border as
well as offshore oil production. Analysts said although the storm
had not damaged the Gulf oil fields, up to 1 million gallons a day
of gasoline could be lost if production was halted to wait out the
storm.
   The approaching hurricane increased demand for gasoline at both
the wholesale and retail levels and caused long lines at gas pumps
in Texas. But analysts said they did not anticipate any immediate
increase in retail prices.
   ``If the hurricane comes in and does damage it will have an
effect on retail prices,'' said Andrew Lebow, senior broker and
analyst with E.D.&F. Man International Futures Inc. ``But right now
the impact is localized and there is no impact at the pump.''
   The overriding element in the market Wednesday involved
OPEC-related developments, including an announcement that the
cartel's price monitoring committee would meet later this month,
which signaled a possible cutback in OPEC production.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto announced the cartel's price
monitoring committee would meet Sept. 25-26.
   Although members of the committee _ Saudi Arabia, Venezuela,
Algeria, Indonesia and Nigeria _ cannot take pricing or production
action, they can call a meeting of the entire 13-member
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The prospect of such a meeting was enough to move the market,
although most traders remained cautious.
   ``It indicates that OPEC is going to take some action,'' Lebow
said.
   Reports Wednesday also indicated some members of OPEC had
reduced their output. The market turned bearish last week on
reports that OPEC was producing 20 million barrels of oil a day, or
more than 1 million barrels above the level the market could
absorb. Wednesday's reports indicated OPEC production was down to
about 18.5 million barrels, said Peter Beutel, assistant director
of Elders Futures Inc.

   The United States doesn't have the world's
biggest phone company anymore. Or the biggest banks. Or even the
world's biggest stock market.
   But it still has the world's biggest computer company.
International Business Machines Corp. towers over almost every
facet of the world information industry, which is burgeoning in
size to rival oil and autos.
   Even with the dollar at depressed levels, IBM's $54 billion in
revenue last year was more than triple that of its closest Japanese
competitor, Fujitsu Ltd., which pulled in $16 billion.
   Now, though, even Big Blue is adjusting to a new age of limits.
Like the United States as a whole, the computer giant is
discovering that the rules of the game are changing. It has
encountered fierce new competitors on unaccustomed battlefields and
found its old weapons inadequate.
   This past week, nine smaller rivals ganged up to adopt a new
data pathway for personal computers, rejecting the one IBM had
hoped to establish as an industry standard.
   In adjusting, IBM has cut jobs (without layoffs), trimmed
expansion plans and learned to be less imperious with customers.
   IBM clearly intends to stay on top of the heap, but it has
learned painfully that too-rapid growth has its drawbacks.
   ``They're being hit from all sides by the Japanese as well as
smaller American companies that are faster on their feet and don't
suffer the problem of bureaucracy,'' said Bernard Slade, a former
IBMer who is a senior management consultant with United Research
Co. in Morristown, N.J.
   Being big means IBM can afford to spend $5.4 billion a year on
research, development and engineering, more than the entire revenue
of all but 75 of the Fortune 500 companies.
   It also means IBM is the only company that offers products in
everysegment from personal computers to mainframes to software.
That gives it an advantage in the coming era of ``systems
integration,'' when customers will focus on tying their equipment
into a smoothly running whole.
   But size isn't everything, as General Motors Corp. and the
Defense Department well know.
   John F. Akers, the 53-year-old former Navy fighter pilot who
heads IBM, has been striving to streamline the company by reducing
staff and moving more people into jobs that deal directly with
customers.
   The chairman and chief executive was asked in June at a news
conference in London whether the decentralization was an
acknowledgement that being big had its problems.
   ``No question about it,'' he said.
   Akers told the London reporters he wants IBM people to take more
risks and act more like entrepreneurs at every level of the
company, ``which by its very nature suggests we are going to make
more mistakes in the future than we have in the past.''
   One sign that IBM has not entirely changed its strategy is its
continued commitment _ restated this past week _ to grow over the
long term at the same rate as the overall industry in each of the
areas in which it participates.
   ``Long term'' could be the key phrase because it gives the
company leeway to hold back on expansion when it is prudent to do
so.
   Trying to match a 20 percent industry growth spurt in a single
year could seriously discombobulate a company of IBM's size.
   IBM's profits fell in 1985 and 1986, the first case of
back-to-back earnings declines since the Great Depression, and many
analysts attributed it to overstaffing and overbuilding in the
early 1980s, when the company overestimated its growth potential.
   IBM is determined not to let that happen again, says Marc
Schulman of Salomon Brothers Inc. in a recent research report.
   ``We believe that the company has determined that it is not in
its interest to attempt to maintain or increase market share at all
times in all markets,'' Schulman wrote.
   Most observers agree IBM is nimbler than other big companies and
they praise the company's no-layoff tradition, which has endured in
spite of the effort to become leaner and meaner.
   ``It's created a higher degree of esprit de corps, a better
environment for people to work, and a higher degree of
professionalism because people have been wedded to the company,''
said Slade, who spent 16 years at the company.
   ``In essence, IBM has been warehousing employees until such time
as they become necessary,'' said Salomon's Schulman.
   Being IBM means carrying a lot of baggage_ product lines such as
mainframes that made it into the giant of today but will be
relatively less important in the future.
   ``The biggest piece of baggage they have to drag around is
compatibility with the 370 (series) mainframe user base,'' which
accounted for about $28 billion of IBM's $54 billion in revenue
last year, including related add-ons, software and maintenance,
said David H. Andrews, president of ADM Inc. in Cheshire, Conn.
   ``They can't do anything to radically disturb that (mainframe
business), but it doesn't provide much opportunity, either,'' said
Andrews, whose company provides consulting to IBM corporate
customers.
   IBM's size gives it the potential, at least theoretically, to
force competitors out of business. Indeed, the Justice Department
filed an antitrust suit against IBM in 1969 and didn't drop the
action until 1982 under the Reagan administration.
   Although IBM no longer has to tiptoe the way it once did, it is
still on warning not to emphasize its size in its advertising.
   The kind of practices that helped IBM grow in the past _ and
drew the scrutiny of antitrust lawyers _ are the same ones that are
inhibiting the company today.
   Critics say IBM intentionally segmented the market with a
variety of incompatible computers so that it could manipulate
prices, lowering them in the segments under attack from rivals
while keeping fat profit margins in segments where it faced less
competition.
   IBM says it made different kinds of computers to satisfy
different kinds of customers. In any case, the lack of
compatibility left an opening for competitors such as Digital
Equipment Corp., which uses a single operating system in its entire
Vax line.
   If IBM makes it easy for its computers to interconnect with each
other and competitors' models, it will open its sheltered accounts
to the fiercest competition ever. It is a risky strategy, but the
alternative is to stick with a steadily dwindling group of IBM
loyalists.
   IBM is taking the risk _ spending $200 million this year alone
on the AIX base software that is one key to the highly competitive
``open systems'' of the future.
   IBM's strategy of cutting costs, decentralizing and plunging
into the competitive market of open systems indicates that the
people running the giant realize they are in a new era and are
determined to adapt to it.
   ``IBM's grand plan,'' said ADM's Andrews, ``is to ensure growth
and dominance in the 1990s.''

   Guinness PLC said its profit after taxes rose 19
percent in the first half of 1988 from a year earlier, helped by a
large reduction in the interest charges on its debt.
   The big British liquor company reported Thursday that its profit
for the first six months of the year rose to 111 million pounds, or
about $186 million, from 93 million pounds, or $156 million, in the
same period a year earlier.
   Earnings per share increased to 13.1 pence, or 22 cents, from
11.1 pence, or 19 cents.
   For nearly two years, Guinness has been embroiled in a scandal
surrounding its 1986 takeover of Distillers Co. PLC, a British gin
and whisky maker.
   Guinness has admitted that its former management arranged for
third parties to repurchase Guinness' stock, apparently to boost
its share price and make its cash and stock offer for Distillers
more attractive than a rival bid. Seven men face criminal charges
in the case, including Ernest Saunders, Guinness' former chairman
and chief executive.
   Guinness' revenue in the first half jumped 16 percent _ to 1.14
billion pounds, or around $1.92 billion, from 986 million pounds,
or $1.66 billion.
   Interest charges paid by the company fell 33 percent in the
period, to 24 million pounds, or $40 million.
   The decline reflects the reduction in Guinness' debt as it has
received the proceeds from the sale of several peripheral
businesses outside its core spirits and brewing operations.
   ``In the first half of 1988, we made considerable progress in
furthering our declared strategy to build on our core businesses of
spirits and brewing,'' Guinness Chief Executive Anthony Tennant
said.
   The company didn't provide separate quarterly results. It isn't
required to do so under British law.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened slightly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade as fears eased about Hurricane
Gilbert's potential threat to Southern soybean crops.
   Crop futures prices had risen moderately Wednesday as the raging
storm approached the Gulf of Mexico. But analysts said today it
appeared the hurricane would skirt the central section of Texas'
southern coast, reducing the potential for serious crop damage.
   Some concern remained that Gilbert would spawn storms in the
Midwest, where weekend showers moving in from the West already were
expected to slow the corn and soybean harvest _ a prospect that
should support prices, analysts said.
   ``The farmers could be out of their fields for a few days,''
said Jerry Gidel, grain market analyst with the Chicago-based G.H.
Miller division of British-owned LIT America Inc.
   The Agriculture Department's rejection of several bids for
subsidized U.S. wheat sent wheat prices lower this morning, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 3{ cents to 4\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $4.09 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 2} cents lower with September at $2.84 a bushel; oats
were unchanged to 3{ cents lower with September at $2.68 a bushel;
soybeans were 2{ cents to 7{ cents lower with September at $8.75 a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .68 cent lower to .27 cent higher with October
at 69.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .40 cent
lower with September at 79.55 cents a pound; hogs were .27 cent
lower to .20 cent higher with October at 37.95 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .27 cent to .50 cent lower with February
at 47.80 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher on Wednesday while pork futures
were mixed.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Flat to Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices were unchanged to higher in calm
trading early today, continuing to draw support from Wednesday's
encouraging report on the nation's trade deficit for July.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year issue was up about \
point, or $2.50 for every $1,000 in face value, at midday. Its
yield, which moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator
of interest rate trends, slipped to 8.95 percent from 8.97 percent
late Wednesday.
   Analysts said the advance in bond prices touched off Wednesday
by the trade report was steady but not robust.
   ``The bond market does not seem to have a whole lot of upside
potential,'' said John Sebastian, executive vice president of
Clayton Brown & Associates, an investment firm in Chicago.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that the U.S. merchandise
trade deficit fell to $9.5 billion in July from a revised $13.2
billion shortfall the previous month.
   The July figure represented the lowest monthly imbalance since
December 1984 and was far less than the $11.5 billion to $12.5
billion most analysts had anticipated.
   Analysts said they were encouraged by the fact that the improved
trade picture was due largely to a drop in imports rather an
increase in exports. They said that suggested the economy may be
slowing down, thereby easing fears of inflation.
   The bond market shrugged off the news toturday, declared today that
presidential rival Michael Dukakis is
an Olympic champion ``in the tax-and-spend competition.'' Dukakis
traveled to Wyoming to view damage and praise firefighters at
Yellowstone National Park.
   Bush said at a breakfast of the Commonwealth Club in San
Francisco, ``My opponent still says he wants to do for the nation
what he has done for Massachusetts. That slogan is beginning to
sound more and more like a threat.''
   Dukakis has indeed pointed with pride to his state's economic
condition. However, Bush said of the governor: ``The judges have
made their final decision. ... If this were the Olympics, his
composite score would make him the gold medal winner in the
tax-and-spend competition.''
   Meanwhile, Dukakis' Democratic running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
declared today in Dallas that ``the polls have turned around'' and
that Republicans' ``outrageous charges on patriotism'' had created
a backlash among voters.
   Sen. Dan Quayle, Bush's running mate, said today in Oklahoma
City that ``I will be delighted to compare my qualifications'' to
those of Dukakis, who has been suggesting voters wouldn't be wise
to put the Indiana senator ``a heartbeat away'' from the presidency.
   The Bush campaign began airing in California an anti-Dukakis ad
saying the Massachusetts governor had a chance to clean up Boston
Harbor but chose not to, raising the cost when the job eventually
is done.
   The Democratic nominee, completing three days of foreign policy
and defense speeches, charged Wednesday that the nation's military
has suffered from years of neglect under the Reagan administration.
   Dukakis promised an audience in Annapolis, Md., that the nation
is ``going to have strong strategic forces, we're going to have
strong conventional forces, and we're going to clean up the mess in
the Pentagon.''
   Bush told a raucous rally in San Francisco's Chinatown that the
November election provides the voters with a choice. ``You can
choose to keep going with the policies that have launched the
longest period of economic growth in history or you can choose to
go backward.''
   The vice president was campaigning again today in California, a
key state with the most electoral votes, 47, before ending the day
in Ohio.
   Dukakis was flying to Yellowstone to view fire damage to 939,270
acres of the 2.2 million-acre facility and meet with firefighters,
local residents and governors of Western states.
   Dukakis was not expected to take a position on the question of
whether the Reagan administration was wrong to let the fires burn
unchecked until mid-July.
   ``He's not going out there to criticize but to talk and listen
and learn ... He wants to see the fires, listen, and say that if
elected president he'll look at the fire policy,'' Dukakis
communications director Leslie Dach said.
   Republican Quayle, stumping for votes in Kansas, held his first
news conference since Sept. 1. Quayle's counterpart, Democrat
Bentsen, was appearing in Dallas and Memphis, Tenn.
   The two contenders got word Wednesday on their only vice
presidential debate, which was set for Oct. 5 in Omaha, Neb.
Bentsen said debating Quayle would give both an opportunity ``to
compare our records of experience and accomplishment in the U.S.
Senate.''
   The two encountered hostile crowds on the campaign trail as the
GOP senator from Indiana was jeered by Dukakis supporters chanting
``Go home Quayle!'' in Albuquerque, N.M., and hecklers rattled the
Democratic senator in his home state of Texas.
   ``As you listen to this babble over here, you can't help but
think of the Dukakis positions,'' Quayle said. ``They have no
positions. They're loud but they don't have any ideas.
   Bentsen, who overcame his initial problems to respond to the
jeers in Grand Prairie, Texas, defended his running mate as a
candidate who would strengthen the military with practical weapons
instead of the ``Buck Rogers'' type of GOP program.
   Dukakis, in a speech at Georgetown University, promised his
support for development of the Advanced Tactical Fighter aircraft
and the Sea Wolf attack submarine, if elected.
   ``It's time for an end to Republican smoke and mirrors on
national defense,'' Dukakis said.
   President Reagan, campaigning for Bush in Missouri, made his
first referrence to Dukakis' recent emphasis on defense and foreign
policy, saying, ``We haven't seen such a radical transformation
since Dustin Hoffman played `Tootsie.'''
   Bush, who pitched patriotism to Hispanic workers in Fresno,
Calif., courted Asian voters in San Francisco with the words ``only
one man is pledged to build a better America through low taxes and
high opportunity, and only one man wants laws against crime,
tougher laws, and creative programs for our schools.''
   ``Only one person _ only one person can carry America's peace
and prosperity into the 1990s,'' he said. ``I am here to tell you
that I am that man.''
   Later, however, about 400 demonstrators gathered at Union Square
across from the hotel where Bush delivered a fund-raising speech.
The protesters chanted ``Where's George'' and ``Money for AIDS,
stop the war, U.S. out of El Salvador.'' Police said at least one
person was arrested.
   In the latest nationwide poll, an ABC News-Washington Post
survey of 1,092 likely voters, Dukakis and Bush were essentially
tied, with 48 percent supporting Dukakis for president and 45
percent backing Bush. The poll had a margin of sampling error of
three percentage points.
   The poll was conducted Sept. 7 through Tuesday, finishing two
days after two other polls that had found an eight-point Bush lead.
That indicated some movement to Dukakis in those last two days.

<HEAD>Small Business Has a Banking Gripe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Small-business owners and executives aren't
exactly overjoyed about their relationships with bankers, and are
particularly steamed up about what they feel are excessive lending
rates.
   To which you might respond: So what else is new?
   Agreed, the small-business view does not break new ground, but a
study just completed draws dire consequences from it, particularly
the inference that the dispensing of services in America may be
declining.
   The study, by the NFIB Foundation, found that just 60 percent of
all small-business loan applicants left their banks satisfied, a
finding the foundation felt was so important it led to its major
conclusion.
   William Dennis, Jr., senior research fellow, explains that
conclusion:
   ``Not long ago, the United States lost preeminence in
manufacturing due to the decline in product quality. Since that
time American industry has struggled mightily _ sometimes
successfully and sometimes not _ to regain lost markets.
   ``The 60 percent figures raises the specter that the same
process may be occurring in services.''
   This conclusion is made despite what some bankers claim is an
explosion of new and valuable products from lending institutions in
the aftermath of deregulation. But the survey concludes differently.
   According to John Sloan, president of the National Federation of
Independent Business and a former banker, the results of
deregulation ``are virtually invisible.''
   Although the study, which involved more than 1,900 businesses,
found some evidence of greater competition for small-business
accounts, Sloan states that ``small-business owners have not only
seen little in the way of improved services or benefits, they have
actually been hit with higher interest rates.''
   The Washington-based federation has more than 500,000 business
members, some with sales in the scores of millions of dollars, a
dimension that hardly qualifies them as ``small.''
   Just what is ``small'' has always been a subject of dispute,
with some analysts limiting it mainly to proprietorships, while
others define the category so broadly as to include any business
other than the 1,000 largest.
   Stating that small business is enormous by any measure, Dennis
offers these statistics:
   _More than 17 million federal income tax returns containing some
type of business income were filed in 1986, and more than 4 million
businesses employed people.
   _Approximately 99 percent of all businesses are classified as
small. ``In fact, most small businesses are very small. Nearly 60
percent of all employers have only one to four employees. Ninety
percent have less than 20.''
   _Small business produces about 38 percent of the gross national
product, and nearly half of the nation's gross business product,
constituting more than $1.5 trillion of goods and services every
year.
   _Small companies have created most of the 34 million new jobs in
the United States since 1970. ``Smaller firms now employ over half
the private sector workforce.''
   Small business, in short, is a vital economic force _ one of the
world's largest. By some estimates, says Dennis, it is the world's
third largest economy, trailing only the United States as a whole
and the Soviet Union.
   And yet, the study suggests, it is not being serviced properly
by banks.
   An example:
   Diversity within the small-business population implies that
small-business financial conditions and demands for financing must
also be highly diverse.
   But, Dennis observes, ``with lending authority often physically
removed from a small-business owner's branch, and transaction costs
for custom loans comparatively high, `cookie cutter banking'
appears increasingly in vogue.''
   Almost all transactions, he continues, are cut from the same
pattern, the result of tension between ``the small business need
for individualized borrowing and the banks' demand for greater
uniformity in lending.''

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A playful bit of English tradition went on the
auction block Thursday.
   The owner of Hamleys of Regent Street, one of the world's
oldest, biggest and most famous toy shops, said the flagship store
and the Hamleys name will be sold, with hopes the new owner will
expand the business worldwide.
   ``We are selling a major piece of English heritage,'' said
Graham Watson, a spokesman. ``That history and heritage can be
exploited by the right buyers.''
   Major American retailers have expressed an interest in buying
the 228-year-old store, which holds a royal warrant as a toy and
sports merchant to Queen Elizabeth II, said the owner, Lowndes
Queensway PLC.
   The company said the sale would give a new owner the opportunity
to develop the Hamleys name by franchising or licensing it for use
in major international retailing centers; developing a Hamleys
brand of high quality toy, clothing and other products for sale
around the world; and through sponsoring prestigious events such as
the Wimbledon tennis tournament.
   Lowndes Queensway said it is selling Hamleys to concentrate on
its furniture and carpet businesses.
   The company set an Oct. 3 deadline for bids and said it expected
to announce a purchaser at the end of next month.
   ``It is a unique brand and a unique opportunity and we believe
the price will reflect that uniqueness,'' said Watson, who is a
director of Noble Grossart Ltd., the firm that is handling the sale.
   Lowndes Queensway shut down 10 other Hamley stores throughout
Britain this year after the chain's previous owner, Harris
Queensway PLC, failed in an attempt to expand domestically.
   Lowndes Ventures PLC, a holding company, acquired Harris
Queensway last month, saying it would return Harris Queensway to
its core businesses of furniture and carpet retailing. Hamleys is
the first unrelated business being sold.
   ``The future for Hamleys lies not in opening stores throughout
the U.K. (United Kingdom), but is to have Hamleys stores and
Hamleys goods in places like New York, Paris and Rome,'' Watson
said.
   Located on Regent Street, one of London's finest shopping
streets, Hamleys boasts an extensive range of merchandise _ more
than 25,000 product lines.
   Founded in 1760 by toymaker William Hamley, the retailer
currently is making a pre-tax profit equivalent to about $3.4
million on annual sales of about $31 million, Watson said.
   Watson said many of up to 40 inquiries Lowndes Queensway already
has received came from parties overseas.
   ``The ownership of Hamleys may become foreign at the end of this
exercise,'' he said.

   Share prices rose Thursday in moderate trading on
the London Stock Exchange, as the market awaited some new British
inflation figures.
   ``We're in a period now where we're always waiting for the next
indicator so we're not seeing any real underneath interest except
in speculative situations,'' one analyst said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index edged up 4.2
points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,769.3. The index was up as much as
10.7 points at mid-morning before sliding back in a jittery market.
   Volume was 435.3 million shares, up from 394.6 million shares
Wednesday.
   Traders said shares slipped from higher levels on rekindled
worries over the possibility of rising interest rates.
   They said the market was unsettled by Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's remark Wednesday that the British retail
sales price index for August, to be released Friday, will show a
``significant increase.''
   The Financial Times 30-share index rose 5.5 points to 1,422.0.
The Financial Times 500-share index rose 3.19 points to close at
1,001.80.

   To Wall Street's known and alleged insider

has become an accursed synonym for trouble.
   The lanky, 38-year-old head of the Securities and Exchange
Commission's enforcement division, who once drove a truck for the
family business, leads a team of lawyers and investigators that has
stunned the financial world with the biggest crackdown on
securities law abuse in history.
   It's an effort that has made Wall Street felons Dennis Levine
and Ivan Boesky household words. It has forced the most venerable
brokerages to re-evaluate and tighten their own compliance and
ethics codes. Moreover, it is likely to lead to tough new laws on
insider trading and other frauds.
   To Lynch, a 6-foot-2 father of two young sons who works 11-hour
days and weekends for an annual salary of about $72,000, a fraction
of what he'd earn in a private practice, this is the reward for
taking on the role of top SEC cop.
   ``It took a couple of years for me to get to the point where I
enjoyed it,'' he said in a telephone interview Thursday from his
office in Washington. ``For the forseeable future I see myself
staying right here.''
   Lynch and his crew made perhaps the biggest splash of their
careers Sept. 7 with a 184-page civil complaint against Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., its celebrity high-yield bond financier
Michael Milken and other employees, accusing them of secretly
scheming with Boesky to violate a litany of securities laws and
cheat Drexel's own clients.
   The complaint, which marked the most aggressive SEC enforcement
action ever undertaken against an investment firm, capped a nearly
two-year probe of Drexel, implicated by Boesky when he settled
insider trading charges with the SEC in 1986 and paid the
enforcement agency a record $100 million.
   Drexel has asserted its innocence and assembled a scrappy legal
team to fight the accusations, which may not be resolved for years.
   In accordance with SEC policy, Lynch would not elaborate on the
allegations against Drexel, which is still under investigation. But
those who know Lynch say he's a tenacious legal adversary who
shouldn't be underestimated.
   ``He's a fine individual and an outstanding lawyer. I'm proud of
him,'' said Stanley Sporkin, a former SEC enforcement chief who
hired Lynch in 1976. ``He's a very quiet, reserved person who goes
about his job and does it.''
   Sporkin, now a federal judge in Washington, said Lynch impressed
him soon after joining the division by taking on a tortuously
complex securities law violation case involving a West Coast firm
with an aggressive defense lawyer.
   ``From that point on,'' recalled Sporkin, ``I knew I could rely
on him. When he told me there was something there, there was
something there.''
   Lynch grew up in rural New York, attended Syracuse University
and graduated from Duke University Law School in 1975, but wasn't
sure he wanted to make a career out of law.
   He wound up driving a truck in Florida for his brother's
business before spending a year in private practice and
subsequently joining the SEC.
   Quickly rising through the enforcement division, from staff
attorney to branch chief to assistant director, he developed a
reputation as one of the shrewdest SEC lawyers around, especially
because of his talents at uncovering ``paper trails'' of fraud and
bargaining for information.
   ``I've certainly always enjoyed the investigative process,''
Lynch said. ``I like putting the puzzle together. I also have to
say I like negotiating deals, even if eventually a deal's not
reached.''
   Lynch got the division's top job in early 1985 and became the
youngest enforcement chief in SEC history. Although some securities
lawyers say privately that Lynch happened to be in the right place
at the right time to lead the crusade against Wall Street greed,
others say he was crucial to the effort.
   ``Without him, this wouldn't have gotten done,'' said Edward
Herlihy, a New York attorney and a former SEC assistant enforcement
chief who had been Lynch's superior in the late 1970s. ``I think
less-able people than Gary Lynch would have stubbed their toes.''
   Lynch's colleagues say he personally pierced the veil of secrecy
surrounding the Bahamas branch of a Swiss bank where convicted
insider trader Dennis Levine maintained a bank account to handle
his illicit deals.
   Faced with exposure, Levine cooperated with the SEC and federal
prosecutors, becoming the key figure that led them to Boesky.
   Softspoken and modest, with gray-flecked hair that belies his
age, Lynch also is credited with restoring sapped morale at the
enforcement division, which had watched Lynch's predecessor, John
Fedders, depart amid scandal.
   After Fedders' resignation, prompted by charges that he had
beaten his wife, Lynch managed to keep many talented SEC lawyers
from leaving for higher-paying jobs in private practice.
   Lynch is not without critics in the government, however. Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House subcommittee on
oversight and investigations, has chided Lynch and his staff for
not aggressively pursuing other securities law abuses besides the
highly publicized insider trading cases.
   Others have criticized Lynch for allowing Boesky to settle
insider trading charges for only $100 million and permitting him to
sell large positions before the charges against him were announced
in November 1986 _ in effect letting Boesky trade on inside
information about his impending demise.
   Lynch rejects such criticisms, saying that under his tenure the
SEC has pursued more enforcement cases than at any other time in
history.

   The stock market barely budged today,
registering little response to new signs of a slowing economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up .36 to 2,101.00
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers and losers ran about even in the overall tally of New

prompted talk that the danger of an ``overheating'' economy was

   But analysts said investors still weren't inclined to commit
themselves heavily to stocks, in part because interest-bearing
investments still offer high yields relative to inflation and to
prospective returns on stocks.
   Hospital Corp. of America jumped 6~ to 44 on word that members

<TEXT>
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said
Thursday it had reached agreement to share information with the
British government in an effort to better coordinate regulation of
the futures industry.
   CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm said that the agreement reached with
the Securities and Investment Board of the United Kingdom would
allow for exchanging information about U.S. futures firms operating
branches in London and British firms which solicit American
customers.
   Among other things, she said British regulators had agreed to
accept financial data filed with the CFTC by U.S. firms and would
drop requirements for essentially duplicative filings from those
firms' London offices.
   Under the agreement, the CFTC and the American industry's own
policing organizations agreed to alert British regulators about
developments which would signal a firm could be in financial
trouble.
   British regulators agreed to share information about financial
problems detected in the London offices of U.S. firms or with
British firms soliciting business from American investors.
   The CFTC said that about 20 U.S. futures firms operate London
offices.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Close Lower After Technical Rally Fails</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed broadly lower
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade after an attempt to rally
soybean prices to last week's highs fizzled, prompting a rapid
last-minute sell-off.
   The mid-session buyers, led by brokerage-house and
commodity-fund traders, ``all ended up scattering to the winds in
the last final seconds,'' said Jerry Gidel, an analyst in Chicago
with the G.H. Miller division of the British-owned trading company
LIT America Inc.
   Gidel said fears of crop damage from Hurricane Gilbert _ a major
factor in Wednesday's price rally _ had largely dissipated on
expectations that the storm would skirt most of the Texas coastline.
   Higher cash prices for U.S. soybean meal and rumors that the
Soviet Union may have bought up to 500,000 metric tons of Argentine
soybean meal also contributed to the mid-session rally, Gidel said.
   But analysts said the midday buyers turned sellers when they
found no support for soybean prices above $8.90 for September
delivery and $9.03{ for November delivery.
   At the close, wheat was 5\ cents to 7 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $4.08 a bushel; corn was 2
cents to 5{ cents lower with September at $2.82 a bushel; oats were
1 cent to 4{ cents lower with September at $2.67 a bushel; soybeans
were 5 cents to 9 cents lower with September at $8.73 a bushel.

<HEAD>Citing Health Reasons, Harrison Resigns As President of Troubled
Utility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Public Service Company of
New Hampshire, the first major investor-owned electric company
since the Depression to seek bankruptcy protection, has resigned
due to health reasons, the utility announced Thursday.
   Robert Harrison, 56, joined the state's largest power company 31
years ago and became president in 1981.
   He had been vice president since 1973, overseeing finances for
the building of the company's $5.6 billion Seabrook nuclear plant,
which was completed two years ago but remains unlicensed because of
evacuation-planning obstacles.
   At a special meeting Wednesday, the utility's board of directors
named John Duffett, its chief operating officer and a 32-year
veteran of the company, to succeed Harrison.
   Duffett, 60, becomes the fifth president in the utility's
62-year history. The directors also named William Scharffenberger,
67, as board chairman, a position that had been unfilled.
   Scharffenberger, who is president and chief executive officer of
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., has ``extensive experience in
corporate reorganizations,'' Public Service said in a statement.
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh, based in Wheeling, W.Va., has been under
Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection since April 1985.
   Delays in licensing the Seabrook project forced Public Service
to seek protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy laws on Jan. 28.
   Scharffenberger said the board expects a smooth transition of
leadership that would not delay filing of a reorganization plan
with the bankruptcy court. Public Service has until Dec. 27 to file
such a plan.
   Harrison, who has a history of heart disorders, will retire
under the company's disability benefits program, the company said.
   ``He has been under a lot of stress, and his doctor has ordered
him to relieve himself of that stress,'' a company director, Philip
Dunlap, said in an interview Thursday.
   In a statement, Harrison said he was ``deeply disappointed that
it is necessary to leave in the midst of the restoration of PSNH's
financial health.''
   Harrison was active in obtaining financing for Seabrook, which
Public Service began building in 1976.
   But as construction began, so did protests which blossomed into
mass demonstrations that made Seabrook a symbol of the nation's
anti-nuclear movement.
   Public Service's financial condition worsened as construction
continued, and in 1979 a state law went into effect that bars the
company from charging ratepayers for Seabrook before the plant
operates commercially. The utility, which originally owned 50
percent of the project, reduced its share to 36 percent after 1979.
   The first of two planned Seabrook reactor was completed but a
second officially was canceled in 1986.

<HEAD>Asia-Pacific Region To Have Strongest Growth in 1990s, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Asia-Pacific region will be the fastest
growing economic area in the world in the 1990s, a study predicted
Thursday.
   But unlike past years when exports from Japan, Korea, Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Singapore to the rest of the world fueled the
region's progress, the engine of growth in the next decade will be
trade among the area's 12 nations, the report said.
   The 60-page study was prepared by SRI International, a research
firm, and released by the worldlwide accounting firm KPMG Peat
Marwick.
   ``The United States and Western Europe will not support further
large increases in Asia-Pacific exports,'' the report said.
``Therefore, the region will have to depend to a greater extent
than in the past on trade within the region and on development of
their domestic economies.''
   It forecast the annual growth rate for the region would average
about two percentage points higher than the world as a whole over
the 1990s.
   Among the report's predictions for the region:
   _China will have the fastest growing economy, averaging 6.7
percent a year, but its per-capita income will still be the lowest
of the 12 nations.
   _The newly industrializing countries _ South Korea, Hong Kong,
Singapore and Taiwan _ will continue to experience strong growth,
but at a slower pace than during the past several decades. South
Korea is expected to have average growth of around 6.5 percent a
year, with the other three ranging between 5.5 percent and 6
percent.
   _Growth in Thailand and Malaysia will average 5 percent a year.
   _Indonesia and the Philippines will continue to have the weakest
economies, with average annual growth rates of 4 percent and 3
percent, respectively.
   _The three developed countries in the region _ Japan, Australia
and New Zealand _ will have the slowest growth rates. Japan will
lead the trio with an average annual growth rate of slightly more
than 3 percent a year.

<HEAD>Ameritech Chairman Calls for End of Divestiture Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress should lift restrictions preventing
the seven regional Bell telephone companies from making
telecommunications equipment and providing information services,
the chairman of Ameritech said Thursday.
   ``No other single initiative could do more to get this country's
telecommunications policy back on track,'' said William L. Weiss,
head of the Chicago-based Bell company whose subsidiary phone
companies serve Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.
   At a Washington news conference, Weiss said business
restrictions placed on the Bell companies five years ago as part of
the American Telephone & Telegraph Co. divestiture are not serving
the public interest.
   He called it unfair to prevent the companies from making their
own equipment, contending their removal from the marketplace
through the breakup of AT&T has resulted in dominance by foreign
manufacturers and a $2.6 billion trade deficit for
telecommunications equipment at the end of 1987.
   Weiss said he would urge House members to pass a resolution
introduced by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., to lift the manufacturing
ban and allow the regional companies to sell information services
such as financial planning, spreadsheet analyses and electronic
directories provided for computers.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene earlier this year modified the
AT&T consent decree to allow the Bell companies to transmit
information services, but he refused to permit them to originate
the information themselves. He said the Bell companies' control of
local phone networks would give them an unfair advantage over
information-services competitors.
   But Weiss said, ``Supporters of the information services
restriction imply that the restriction is the only way to ensure
fair competition. These people aren't opposed merely to unfair
competition. They prefer no competition, period.
   ``Let it be clear, however, that in their dash to protect their
markets, they are also keeping many critical information services
from the American people and many benefits from the American
economy.''

   The president of Porsche Cars North American
Inc. leaving the company after he disagreed with directors on
organizational changes.
   John Cook, president of the Reno-based company, will leave
immediately under a mutual agreement with the directors of the firm
who want ``a directional change in marketing,'' according to a
statement released Wednesday.
   ``The board of directors decided the sales and marketing
functions of the company should report directly to the president
and Mr. Cook disagreed with that in concept,'' she said.
   Senior executive vice president Frederick Schwab will serve as
interim director of the U.S. subsidiary of West Germany's Porsche
AG until Cook's successor is named, the company said.
   Cook and Schwab could not be reached for comment.
   McKinley said the management shake-up isn't related to the
lagging American sales of Porsche automobiles, down about 18,000
cars a year following a peak of more than 30,000 in 1986.
   Cook joined Porsche Cars North America as president and chief
executive officer in 1985, the year Porsche AG took back
distribution from Volkswagen of America and established
headquarters in Reno.

   Assets of the nation's 452 money market mutual
funds fell $347.4 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $266.58 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $241.3 million drop in the funds' assets the
previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 223 general purpose funds fell $53.5 million to $84.92
billion, assets of 103 broker-dealer funds fell $127.5 million to
$113.1 billion, and assets of 126 institutional funds fell $166.4
million to $68.56 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds in the
week ended Tuesday to 7.39 percent from 7.37 percent the previous
week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 7.31 percent from 7.23 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
34 days, from 33 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to 6
percent as of Wednesday from 5.97 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, were unchanged at 5.12 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.70
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.68 the
previous week. Yields were 8 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.98
percent; 8.28 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.25 percent; and
8.56 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.55 percent.

   The dollar turned mixed Thursday against most
key currencies as dealers assessed the impact of improved U.S.
trade figures for July.
   Gold prices declined. Republic National Bank in New York quoted
bullion at $418.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $429.80
late Wednesday.
   Currency dealers said the dollar fluctuated within a tight range
most of the session following Wednesday's rally that stemmed from a
report showing the U.S. trade deficit fell to $9.5 billion in July
from $13.2 billion in June.
   The government attributed the improvment largely to a sharp drop
in imports.
   ``The trade numbers gave a boost to the dollar but the fact that
imports are down indicated continued evidence of a slowing down of
the economy,'' said James T. McGroarty, a trader at Discount Corp.
in New York. ``That's why we have such a mixed picture. You can say
the dollar is in a holding pattern.''
   Traders said that concerns about possible central-bank
intervention to buffet the dollar's rise also were responsible for
holding the the U.S. currency in check.
   The financial markets were closed in Tokyo for a national
holiday. But in London, the dollar fell to 133.90 Japanese yen from
134.55 yen at Wednesday's close in Tokyo. In New York, the dollar
stood at 133.775 yen, down from 134.275 Wednesday.
   The dollar rose in London against the British pound, which
slipped to $1.6675 from $1.6750 late Wednesday. Sterling fetched
$1.6790 in New York, down from $1.67935 late Wednesday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York compared with levels late
Wednesday: 1.87475 West German marks, down from 1.8770; 1.58235
Swiss francs, up from 1.58165; 1.2225 Canadian dollars, down from
1.22415; 6.37625 French francs, down from 6.3865; and 1,398.70
Italian lire, down from 1,398.75.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Wednesday:
1.8775 West German marks, down from 1.8783; 1.5820 Swiss francs,
down from 1.5835; 6.3790 French francs, down from 6.3915; 2.1160
Dutch guilders, up from 2.1155; 1.2225 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2223; and 1,398.87 Italian lire, down from 1,399.50.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
fell $2.70 to $418.60 a troy ounce.
   In London, gold fell to a late bid`of 6417.75 a troy ounce, down
from $421.75 late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold fell to $417.50 an
ounce from $421.50 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $423.45 an ounce,
unchanged from Wednesday's close.
   Silver prices were weaker. On the New York Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery fell to $6.467 a troy ounce from $6.489
Wednesday. Silver slipped to a late bid of $6.44 an ounce in
London, down from $6.53 Wednesday.

   The stock market pulled back near the close of a
drifting session Thursday, registering little response to new signs
of a slowing economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which spent much of the
day hovering around Wednesday's closing levels, finished with an
8.36 loss at 2,092.28.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
665 up, 766 down and 520 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 161.20 million
shares, down from 177.22 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 194.60 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported Thursday morning that retail
sales declined 0.2 percent in August, after a downward-revised 0.1
percent increase in July.
   That buttressed recent evidence that economic growth has slowed
since midyear, apparently taking some of the pressure off the
Federal Reserve to try to restrain the pace of expansion.
   News the day before of a larger-than-expected decline in the
nation's trade deficit, and in particular of a decline in imports,
also prompted talk that the danger of an ``overheating'' economy
was subsiding.
   But analysts said investors still weren't inclined to commit
themselves heavily to stocks, in part because interest-bearing
investments still offer high yields relative to inflation and to
prospective returns on stocks.
   Hospital Corp. of America jumped 6| to 43} on word that members
of its top management proposed a leveraged buyout at about $47 a
share.
   Other hospital management stocks moved up in sympathy. Humana
rose | to 26{; National Medical Enterprises 1\ to 21|, and American
Medical International } to 16|.
   Zayre gained 2 to 25 and Ames Department Stores dropped ~ to
16]. Ames said it agreed to buy Zayre's 388-unit discount store
division in a deal it valued at about $800 million.
   Other major retailing issues showed little effect from the
August sales report. Sears Roebuck was down [ at 36{; J.C. Penney
dropped | to 48[, and K mart was unchanged at 36[.
   Macmillan Inc. climbed 2 to 86{. Maxwell Communication Corp.
raised its bid for the company, which has agreed to a buyout by an
investor group for $85 a share.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $9.27 billion, or 0.35
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .53 to 151.60.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 1.45 to 307.94, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.18 at 268.13.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 1.15 to 382.70. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 297.70, down .65.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Are Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply moved in opposite directions in the week ended Sept. 5, the
Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,036.8 billion, up from $3,034.1 billion the previous
week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$3,848.6 billion from $3,849.6 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $783.1 billion from a revised $782.7 billion
the previous week.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   The Fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for
annual growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent,
which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5
percent. The Fed has not set a specific target range for M1 since
early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $358 million in
the week ended Sept. 7, compared with a gain of $568 million a week
earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $552 million a day
in the week ended Sept. 7, down from $577 million in the previous
week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $281.1 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $281.8 billion two weeks earlier.

   General Motors Corp. on Thursday recalled about
30,500 cars, trucks, vans and school buses for safety-related
inspections and repairs.
   GM said it was aware of just one accident and no injuries
involving the vehicles.
   About 8,000 1988 Buick Regals were being recalled for inspection
and possible replacement of a brake hose which could wear through
and result in a reduction of braking capability, the automaker said
in a written statement.
   GM said about 21,000 1985 and 1986 Chevrolet and GMC P-30 trucks
and G-30 vans were being recalled to repair a control arm in the
front suspension. The arm could crack, resulting in a loss of
steering control, the company said.
   The 1,500 1987 and 1988 model Chevrolet and GMC school buses,
all equipped with gasoline engines, were being recalled because of
possible problems in the location of air brake lines. The lines may
have been put too close to exhaust systems, causing wearing and a
partial or complete loss of brakes.
   The company said the only accident of which it was aware
involved a P-30 truck and did not result in an injury.
   Repairs will be performed for free.

<HEAD>Cotton Futures Plunge As Worries About Hurricane Damage Recede</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cotton futures prices plummeted the permitted daily limit of 2
cents a pound Thursday on the New York Cotton Exchange as fears of
hurricane damage to the Texas cotton crop receded.
   On other markets, prices for future delivery of oil, precious
metals, grains, soybeans, livestock and stocks all declined.
   Cotton for October delivery had gained 2.6 cents a pound during
the previous two days on speculation that Hurricane Gilbert would
strike the Louisiana or northern Texas coastline and damage cotton
crops in the Mississippi Delta region.
   But the huge storm appeared to be tracking further south on
Thursday and was expected to do little harm to the cotton crop,
analysts said. Sell orders poured into the Cotton Exchange, sending
some contracts down the limit in the morning. Prices recovered at
midday but closed limit-down in a second round of heavy selling.
   ``There was a lot of selling coming in, partially profit-taking,
partially establishing new positions, which says there is no need
for cotton to be at these levels,'' said Ernest Simon, cotton
specialist in New York with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Furious winds and driving rain still were forecast for the
southern Texas coastline but most of the cotton in that area
already has been harvested, analysts said.
   The hurricane poses the worst threat to cotton plants with open
bolls that expose the white fibers to the elements.
   ``Any rain will stress the cotton, discolor it and dirt will get
inside,'' said Judith Ganes, an analyst in New York with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. ``Not only can the crop lose quantity, but the
quality is diminished.''
   Simon said the only exposed cotton was in western Texas. Most of
the cotton in the state's north-central and west-central regions
had not opened yet, and growers there want rain, he said.
   Cotton settled 1.90 cents to 2 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in October at 54.85 cents a pound.
   The prospects of a major disruption of oil refining along the
Texas-Louisiana coast also diminished with the changing hurricane
forecasts, sending energy futures prices down sharply on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 46 cents to 50 cents
lower with October at $14.90 a barrel; heating oil was 1.16 cents
to 1.37 cents lower with October at 42.70 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .48 cent to 1.39 cents lower with October at 45.63
cents a gallon.
   The drop in energy prices reinforced the prevailing bearish
attitude among gold futures traders on New York's Commodity
Exchange, where prices dropped to their lowest levels in more than
17 months.
   Credit-tightening moves by the Federal Reserve and central banks
in Europe have weakened inflationary pressures and dampened
investor demand for gold, said George Anagnos, metals analyst with
Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   The Commerce Department's report that retail sales declined 0.2
percent last month ``simply confirmed the precedent of recent
economic statistics, which suggest the economy is growing in a more
tempered and sustainable fashion,'' he said.
   Gold settled $2.70 to $3.50 lower with the contract for delivery
in October at $419.80 a troy ounce; silver was 2.2 cents to 3 cents
lower with September at $6.467 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures finished broadly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade after an attempt to rally soybean prices to last
week's highs fizzled, prompting a rapid last-minute sell-off.
   Fading fears of crop damage from Hurricane Gilbert also fueled
the decline, analysts said.
   Wheat settled 5{ cents to 6} cents lower with September at $4.07
a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 5 cents lower with September at
$2.82\ a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 4{ cents lower with
September at $2.65 a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 10 cents
lower with September at $8.72{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures settled mostly lower in line with lower cash
prices. Trading was cautious ahead of Friday's seven-state
cattle-on-feed report from the Agriculture Department.
   Hog futures also were pressured by lower cash markets but frozen
pork bellies finished higher in a technically inspired rally,
analysts said.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .18 cent lower with October at
70.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent lower to .12 cent
higher with September at 79.75 cents a pound; hogs were .60 cent
lower to .20 cent higher with October at 37.95 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .03 cent to .50 cent higher with February
at 48.72 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures retreated modestly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled 1.65 points lower at 267.80.

<HEAD>Drive To Boost Production Could Be Affected By Limited Supplies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's ambitious drive to boost livestock and
poultry production could be held back by a limited availability of
feed supplies, an Agriculture Department report said Thursday.
   The current five-year plan for increasing the output of meat by
18 percent from 19.3 million tons in 1985 to 22.75 million metric
tons by 1990 is meeting with some success, the report said.
   ``The limiting factor in Chinese livestock and poultry
production gains will be feed supplies,'' the report said. ``In
turn, feed grain imports will be constrained in the next two to
three years by China's ability to earn sufficient foreign exchange
for these purchases.''
   China is an important but sometimes erratic market for U.S.
farmers, and the livestock sector is watched closely for signs that
more grain and feed sales may be developing.
   One of the problems cited in the report, which was included in
the October issue of Foreign Agriculture magazine, is this year's
rise in world grain prices, caused by tighter supplies resulting
primarily from the U.S. drought.
   ``Should world commodity prices remain high, the Chinese
government is likely to squeeze exports of corn and soybeans out of
the domestic market in order to earn badly needed foreign
exchange,'' the report said.
   In 1985-86, it said, China exported more than 6 million tons of
corn from its northern provinces while importing 400,000 tons into
the south.
   ``As in the past, China will continue to export soybeans for
foreign exchange and barter with Japan, the U.S.S.R. and other
Asian countries,'' the report said.
