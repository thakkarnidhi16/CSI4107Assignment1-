   Moderator: Andrea Mitchell has a question for you, Governor
Dukakis.
   Dukakis: I beg your pardon.
   Moderator: Andrea Mitchell has a question for you, sir.
   Q: While we're talking about issues, so let's return to
something you said earlier about the modernization of land-based
missiles. You said that you didn't rule it out but that there are
limits to what we can spend. And then, you went on to talk about a
much more expensive part of our defense strategy, namely
conventional forces. Do you somehow see conventional forces as a
substitute for our strategic forces? And in not talking about the
land-based missiles and not committing to modernizing, do you
somehow believe that we can have a survivable nuclear force based
on the air and sea legs of our triad?
   Dukakis: I think we ought to be looking at modernization. I
think we ought to be exploring less expensive ways to get it on
land, and we ought to make sure that we have an effective and
strong and credible nuclear deterrent. But we also need
well-equipped and well-trained and well-supported conventional
forces. And every defense expert I know, including people in the
Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense
spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress
has now approved and the President has signed, there's no way that
you can do all of these things and do them well. That's why tough
choices will be required, choices I'm prepared to make, Mr. Bush is
not prepared to make.
   But Andrea, I think we can go far beyond this as well because we
have opportunities now, step by step, to bring down the level of
strategic weapons and get a test ban treaty, negotiate those
conventional force reductions. I would challenge Mr. Gorbachev to
join with us in limiting and eliminating regional conflict in the
Middle East, in Central America. Let's get him working on Syria,
their client state, and see if we can't get them to join Israel and
other Arab nations, if at all possible, and Arab leaders, in
finally bringing peace to that troubled region. And I think that's
one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can
make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East.
   Let's go to work and end this fiasco in Central America, a
failed policy which has actually increased Cuban and Soviet
influence. The democratic leaders of Central and Latin America want
to work with us. I've met with them. I know them. I've spent time
in South America. I speak the language; so does Senator Bentsen. We
want to work with them and build a new relationship, and they with
us. But not a one of those key democratic leaders support our
policy in Central America. And we've got to work with them if we're
going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for
the people of this hemisphere, and go to work on our single most
important problem, and that is the avalanche of drugs that is
pouring into our country and virtually destroying those countries.
   Those are the kinds of priorities, for national security and for
foreign policy, that I want to pursue. Mr. Bush and I have major
differences on these issues --
   Moderator: Governor --
   Dukakis: -- and I hope very much to be president and pursue them.
   Moderator: Mr. Vice President, you have one minute.
   Bush: In terms of regional tensions, we have now gotten the
attention of the Soviet Union. And the reason we've gotten it is
because they see us now as unwilling to make the very kinds of
unilateral cuts that have been called for, and to go for the
discredited freeze. My opponent had trouble, criticized us on our
policy in Angola. It now looks, because of steady negotiation, that
we may have an agreement that will remove the Cubans from Angola.
   We see the Russians coming out of Afghanistan. That wouldn't
have stopped if we hadn't been willing -- wouldn't have even
started, the Soviets coming out, if we hadn't even been willing to
support the freedom fighters there. And the policy in Central
America regrettably has failed because the Congress has been
unwilling to support those who have been fighting for freedom.
Those Sandinistas came in and betrayed the trust of the revolution.
They said it was about democracy. And they have done nothing other
than solidify their Marxist domination over that country.

   Moderator: Anne Compton for Governor Dukakis.
   Q: Governor, nuclear weapons need nuclear material replenished
on a regular basis. And just this week, yet another nuclear
manufacturing plant was closed because of safety concerns. Some in
the Pentagon fear that too much priority has been put on new
weapons programs, not enough on current programs, and worry that
the resulting shortage would be amounting to nothing less than
unilateral nuclear disarmament.
   Is that a priority that you feel has been ignored by this
administration? Or are the Pentagon officials making too much of it?
   Dukakis: Well, it's a great concern of mine, and I think of all
Americans, and perhaps the vice president can tell us what's been
going on. This is another example of misplaced priorities.
   The administration, which wants to spend billions on weapons
systems that we don't need and can't afford, and now confronts us
with a very serious problem in plants that are supposed to be
producing tritium and plutonium and providing the necessary
materials for existing weapons.
   Yes, if we don't do something about it, we may find ourselves
unilaterally -- if I may use that term -- dismantling some of these
weapons. What's been going on? Who's been in charge? Who's been
managing this system? Why have there been these safety violations?
Why are these plants being closed down? I don't know what the
latest cost estimates are, but it's going to be in the range of
twenty-five, fifty, seventy-five, one hundred billion dollars. Now,
somebody has to bear the responsibility for this.
   Maybe the vice president has an answer, but I'm somebody who
believes very strongly in taking care of the fundamentals first,
before you start new stuff. And that's something which will be a
priority of ours in the new administration, because without it we
cannot have the effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent
we must have.
   Moderator: Mr. Vice President, you have one minute.
   Bush: That is the closest I've ever heard the governor of
Massachusetts come to support anything having to do with nuclear.
That's about as close as I've ever heard him. Yes, this Savannah
River plant needs to be made more safe. Will he join me in
suggesting that we may need another plant, maybe in Idaho, to take
care of the requirements -- nuclear material requirements for our
Defense Department. I hope he will.
   This sounds like real progress here, because we've had a big
difference on the safe use of nuclear power for our energy base. I
believe that we must use clean, safe nuclear power. I believe that
we -- the more dependent we become on foreign oil, the less our
national security is enhanced. And, therefore, I've made some
proposals to strengthen the domestic oil industry, by more
incentive going in to look for and find and produce oil, made him
some incentives in terms of secondary and tertiary production. But
we're going to have to use more gas, more coal, and more safe
nuclear power for our energy base. So, I am one who believes that
we can and must --
   Moderator: Mr. Vice President --
   Bush: -- do what he's talking about now.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Bring Up Personal Losses As They Tackle Abortion
Question</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Debate Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Both George Bush and Michael Dukakis recounted
poignant stories about children they had lost as they sought during
Thursday night's debate to justify their opposing views on abortion.
   Bush was asked why a woman should be forced to carry a fetus to
term if she knows it will be born with an illness that consigns it
to a brief, pained existence.
   Bush, who opposes abortion except in cases of incest, rape or
when a mother's life is endangered, began his answer by cautioning:
``I hope it doesn't get too personal, or maudlin. Bar and I lost a
child, you know that. We lost a daughter, Robin.''
   The child died of leukemia before she turned 4.
   Bush said that if the baby were alive today, ``that child could
stay alive for 10 or 15 years, or maybe for the rest of her life.
And so, I don't think that you make an exception based on medical
knowledge at the time. I think human life is very, very precious.''
   Dukakis, in his response to Bush's answer, said he and his wife,
Kitty, ``had very much the same kind of experience that the Bushes
had. We lost a baby _ lived about 20 minutes after it was born.''
   But Dukakis went on to say that ``isn't the real question that
we have to answer ... who makes the decision, who makes this very
difficult, very wrenching decision.''
   He continued: ``I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise
of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that
decision. Who are we to say, `Well, under certain circumstances
it's all right, but under other circumstances it isn't?'''
   Mrs. Dukakis, who became pregnant early in 1964, believes she
must have had German measles during the first trimester of her
pregnancy. The day after a checkup during her seventh month of
pregnancy, she went into premature labor. The baby girl, who lived
just 20 minutes, was anencephalic and would have been gravely
handicapped had she survived.

<HEAD>LOS ANGELES: about now.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Anne Compton has a question for you.
   Q: Mr. Vice President, as many as 100 officials in this
Administration have left the government under an ethical cloud.
Some have been indicted, some convicted. Many of the cases have
involved undue influence once they are outside of government. If
you become president, will you lock that revolving door that has
allowed some men and women in the government to come back and lobby
the very departments they once managed?
   Bush: Yes, and I'll apply it to Congress too. I'll do both. I'll
do both, because I think, you see, I am one who _ I get kidded by
being a little old fashioned on these things, but I do believe in
public service. I believe that public service is honorable. And I
don't think anybody has a, has a call on people and their
administrations going astray. His chief education advisor is in
jail. He's in jail because he betrayed the public trust. The head
of education.
   And yet, this man, the governor, equated the president to a
rotting fish. He said that, ``A fish rots from the head down,'' as
he was going after Ed Meese. Look, we need the highest possible
ethical standards. I will have an ethical office in the White House
that will be under the president's personal concern. I will see
that these standards apply to the United States Congress. I hope I
will do a good job as one who has had a relatively clean record
with no conflicts of interest in his own public life _ as has the
Governor _ to exort young people to get into public service.
   But, there is no corner on, on this sleaze factor, believe me.
And it's a disgrace, and I will do my level best to clean it up,
recognizing that you can't legislate morality. But, I do believe
that with my record in Congress having led the new congressmen to a
Code of Ethics through major, main emphasis on it in full
disclosure, that I've got a good record. And there are more, if you
want to talk about percentage appointments, more members of
Congress who have been under investigation, percentage wise, than
people in the executive branch. And so it isn't want _ state
governments have had a tough time. His. Some of his college
presidents aren't exactly holier than thou. So let's not be
throwing stones about it. Let's say, ``This isn't Democrat or
Republican, and it isn't liberal or conservative. Let's vow to work
together to do something about it.
   Q: Governor, you have one minute to respond.
   Dukakis: Well, I would agree that integrity is not a Republican
or a Democratic issue. It is an American issue. But, here again, I
don't know which George Bush I'm listening to. Wasn't this the Mr.
Bush that supported Mr. Meese? Called James Watt an excellent
secretary of the Interior? Provided support for some of these
people, supported the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme
Court of the United States? We've had dozens, we've had dozens and
dozens of officials in this administration, who have left under a
cloud, who have left with a special prosecutor on their arm.
They've been indicted, convicted.
   This isn't the kind of administration we need and one of the
reasons our selection of a running mate is so important and is such
a test of the kinds of standards we'll set is because it tells the
American people in advance of the election just what kind of people
we're looking for. I picked Lloyd Bentsen. Mr. Bush picked Dan
Quaid, Dan Quayle. I think that says a great deal to the American
people about the standards we'll set and the quality of the people
that we will pick to serve in our administration.

<HEAD>LOS ANGELES: our administration.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Moderator: To each of you candidates, regrettably, I have to
inform you that we have come to the end of our questions. That's a
pity. Before I ask the candidates to make their closing remarks, on
behalf of the Commission on Presidential Debates, I would like to
thank all of you for joining us this evening. Governor Dukakis,
yours is the first closing statement, sir.
   Dukakis: Twenty-eight years ago, as a young man, just graduated
from law school, I came to this city, came clear across the country
to watch John Kennedy be nominated for the presidency of the United
States, right here in Los Angeles.
   I never dreamed that someday I would win that nomination and be
my party's nominee for president. That's America. That's why I'm
proud and grateful to be a citizen of this country.
   Twenty-six days from today, you and millions of Americans will
choose two people to lead us into the future as president and vice
president of the United States. Our opponents say, ``Things are
okay. Don't rock the boat. Not to worry.'' They say we should be
satisfied.
   But I don't think we can be satisfied when we're spending $150
billion a year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it
going to foreign bankers, or when 25 percent of our high school
students are dropping out of school, or when we have two and a half
million of our fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are
homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country, or
when Mr. Bush's prescription for our economic future is another tax
giveaway to the rich.
   We can do better than that. Not working with government alone,
but all of us working together. Lloyd Bentsen and I are optimists,
and so are the American people. And we ask you for our hand -- for
your hands and your hearts and your votes on the 8th of November so
we can move forward into the future. Kitty and I are very grateful
to all of you for the warmth and the hospitality that you've given
to us in your homes and communities all across this country. We
love you, and we're grateful to you for everything that you've
given to us. And we hope that we'll be serving you in the White
House in January of 1989. Thank you, and God bless you.

<HEAD>LOS ANGELES: bless you.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Moderator: Vice President Bush, your closing statement, sir.
   Bush: Sometimes it does seem that a campaign generates more heat
than light. And so let me repeat, I do have respect for my
opponent, for his family, for the justifiable pride he takes in his
heritage.
   But we have enormous differences. I want to hold the line on
taxes and keep this, the longest expansion in modern history, going
until everybody in America benefits. I want to invest in our
children, because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler
nation. And by that, I want to have child care where the families,
the parents, have control.
   I want to keep our neighborhoods much, much better in terms of
anti-crime. And that's why I would appoint judges that have a
little more sympathy for the victims of crime and a little less for
the criminals. That's why I do feel if some police officer is
gunned down that the death penalty is required. I want to help
those with disabilities fit into the mainstream.
   There is much to be done. This election is about big things, and
perhaps the biggest is world peace. And I ask you to consider the
experience I have had in working with a president who has
revolutionized the situation around the world. America stands tall
again and, as a result, we are credible and we have now achieved a
historic arms control agreement.
   I want to build on that. I'd love to be able to say to my
grandchildren, four years after my first term, I'd like to say,
``Your grandfather, working with the leaders of the Soviet Union,
working with the leaders of Europe, was able to ban chemical and
biological weapons from the face of the Earth.''
   Lincoln called this country the last, best hope of man on earth.
And he was right then, and we still are the last, best hope of man
on earth. And I ask for your support on November 8th, and I will be
a good president. Working together we can do wonderful things for
the United States and for the free world.
   Thank you very, very much.

<HEAD>Politicians Say Both Candidates Improved; Few See Dukakis
``Knockout''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Politicians from both parties said the rival presidential
candidates seemed more at ease in Thursday's debate than in their
first encounter, but most agreed that Michael Dukakis failed to
deliver the ``knockout'' he needed against Vice President George
Bush.
   ``In the debate itself, there was no clear winner, but in the
continuing war, Bush continues to lead,'' said Republican Rep. John
Rowland of Connecticut. ``This was Dukakis' chance for a knockout
blow, and he merely danced in the ring.''
   Democratic Sen. Alan Dixon of Illinois said Dukakis ``won on
issues answers'' about Social Security, gun control and the
environment.
   But Dixon also said, ``There was no, `You're no Jack Kennedy'
tonight,'' referring to a remark _ seen by many as a telling blow _
that Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen made in his debate with Republican
vice presidential candidate Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle.
   One Democrat who gave the edge to Bush was former Sen. Thomas
Eagleton of Missouri, who was George McGovern's running mate in
1972 until he withdrew from the ticket after it became known he had
undergone shock treamtents for psychiatric problems.
   ``The one home run I heard was Bush's,'' said Eagleton. ``When
they asked who their heroes were, Dukakis was wandering all over
the stage. Bush, with two minutes to think about it, came up with
some solid candidates and ended up with the president.''
   Jack Richardson, Hawaii state Democratic Party chairman, agreed
there was ``no knockout blow by Governor Dukakis, but the governor
definitely won.''
   And a knockout blow was just what some observers said Dukakis
needed. With pre-debate polls giving Bush a narrow lead among
voters nationwide and a strong lead for electoral votes, analysts
had seen Thursday's final face-to-face contest as perhaps Dukakis'
best chance to change voters' minds before the election Nov. 8.
   ``Dukakis had to do something dramatic and I don't think he did
it. I don't think he laid a glove on Bush,'' said Ellen Sauerbrey.
GOP state delegate from Maryland. ``I think barring some unforeseen
gaffe in the next couple weeks or a major world-shattering event. I
think the election is over. This was Dukakis' last chance to really
turn public opinion.''
   ``It's over. The election is over,'' agreed Claibourne Darden,
an Atlanta-based political pollster. ``Bush did extremely well,
much better than he did last time, which wasn't real good ...
Dukakis also did well, attempting to add _ and was successful to a
moderate extent _ a human feeling and sense of emotion to his
character. Both were successful, and consequently, the odds of
George Bush losing have become extremely little.''
   Most Republican observers were clearly delighted about Bush's
performance _ and even found room to praise Dukakis.
   ``Let me pay my respects to Michael Dukakis for a very fine
debate, but on the political points, I think Bush clearly won,''
said Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y.
   Said Gordon Durnil, chairman of Indiana Republican Party: ``That
was the absolute best debate performance by anyone I've sever seen
by George Bush. It was a home run for him.''
   ``Both candidates were more relaxed and perhaps more confident
than before,'' said Massachusetts Republican state Sen. David
Locke, the state Bush co-chair. ``However, Governor Dukakis,
despite performing well, failed to provide the American people with
any reason to change the direction in which we're going.''
   But some elected officials were not excited by what they saw
from either candidate.
   Montana's Democratic Gov. Ted Schwinden said: ``I honestly don't
know who the winner is. But I know who the loser is _ the ones of
us who watch.''
   ``It's getting to the point of who's the best actor on stage and
that's a long way from answering who will be the next president,''
Schwinden said.

   Police using federal and local laws to create
``drug free zones'' around schools swept through neighborhoods
Thursday and arrested 83 people and confiscated drugs and guns
including an AK-47 assault rifle.
   The 12-hour sweep was conducted by 250 police officers who posed
as drug buyers near 15 elementary and junior high schools.
   ``People are shocked to learn that most heavy drug trafficking
areas in Los Angeles are around our schools,'' said District
Attorney Ira Reiner after the sweep.
   The youngest person arrested was 14 and perhaps the craftiest
was a 17-year-old alleged drug dealer who had adults working for
him, said Deputy Chief Glenn Levant.
   Ten guns, including the assault rifle, were seized along with
155 grams of rock cocaine, the smokable form also known as crack,
Levant said.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner said 29 of those arrested during the
action will be investigated for violating a federal law against
selling illegal drugs within 1,000 feet of a school. The charge
carries a minimum sentence of one year in prison and a maximum of
40 years.
   The remaining cases will be investigated by the district
attorney, he said. He estimated that about 35 percent of the
suspects are gang members.
   ``This is a program designed to foster and create drug-free
zones around our schools,'' Bonner said.

<TEXT>
   Presidential rivals George Bush and Michael
Dukakis Thursday night gave American voters a review of familiar
themes, providing little drama in a debate that apparently went the
Republican way.
   Drama was not what Bush needed to protect his lead in the polls;
it was Dukakis who needed a high voltage performance to propel his
Democratic candidacy. It never happened.
   As in their first debate, the Republican vice president was more
animated and smiled more easily than did his Democratic rival, a
fact that polls suggested tilted viewers his way during their Sept.
25 confrontation.
   ABC's instant poll following this second televised confrontation
indicated a lopsided preference for Bush, and an Associated Press
panel of debate experts likewise delivered a verdict for the
Republican. The first time around the same judges decided for
Dukakis.
   In a sense, it was clear the two candidates had learned from the
first debate that they would be judged on two levels, not only on
what they said but how they said it, on such intangible factors as
body language.
   Bush rarely looked directly into the television camera and as a
result appeared looser and more relaxed. In contrast, Dukakis
consistently stared directly into the camera which made him appear
stiff.
   Both campaigns moved to take the initiative on the issue field
before the candidates ever stepped on stage.
   An hour before the first question was posed, Bush aides passed
out among the press seven pages of material anticipating some
Dukakis points and attempting to refute them.
   They were followed soon after by Dukakis aides who passed out 13
pages entitled ``The Record of Vice President Bush; Missions
Assigned; Missions Failed.''
   Once the debate began, the candidates were on familiar terrain.
   ``Liberal, liberal, liberal,'' was Bush's favorite way of
referring to his Democratic rival.
   ``If I had a dollar, George, for every time you used that label,
I'd qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want
to give away,'' said Dukakis, getting off one of his best lines of
the evening.
   The first question to Dukakis concerned his opposition to the
death penalty and he quickly shifted the subject to drugs and made
his familiar pledge to wage ``a real war and not a phony war
against drugs.''
   And, of course, the debate no sooner ended than the partisans of
both candidates swarmed into the press room to declare their
favorite the winner and to claim the ``liability factor,'' about
which much was made after the first debate.
   Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston of California said Dukakis
``overcame, the impression some people have had that he's too cold.
... He's not a cold guy, he's a warm guy.''
   Former deputy Treasury secretary Richard Darman, who played the
role of Dukakis during Bush debate preparations, said that on the
question of likability, he thought Dukakis ``didn't help himself
tonight, probably that he hurt himself a little bit.''
   How people judge smiles, body language, gestures and tone of
voice and how it affects their decisions on how to vote is one of
the great mysteries of politics.
   Before the final debate, Dukakis claimed victory for his ticket
in the first two confrontations _ his own with Bush and the meeting
between Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen and his
GOP rival Dan Quayle.
   But if that were correct, the opinion polls were suggesting that
despite Democratic victories in the debates, Republicans were
gaining in the polls.
   Quayle is viewed by the Dukakis campaign and its supporters as
one of their strongest assets, an issue of great concern to voters.
   But Quayle didn't prove to be a compelling issue in the final
debate.
   The first question to Bush dealt with his choice of a running
mate and he responded with a strong defense of his choice that
echoed some of the words he used to defend the Indiana senator
during the first debate.

   George Bush won his second and final debate
with Michael Dukakis by hammering at foreign policy issues, an
Associated Press panel of debate judges said Thursday night.
   Some 639 voters polled by ABC News immediately after the debate
also gave the nod to the vice president, with 49 percent saying
Bush won and only 33 percent giving the edge to Dukakis; 18 percent
called it a tie. The survey had a 4 point margin of error.
   The AP panel scored it a 145-141 win for Bush, reversing the
outcome of the first presidential debate, which the AP judges
scored 144-141 for Dukakis. Five of the six judges called Bush the
winner; one sided with Dukakis.
   ABC also asked its survey group before and after the debate who
they planned to vote for. Beforehand they favored Bush, 53-43, with
4 percent undecided. Afterwards, they backed Bush 54-44, with 2
percent still undecided.
   Among the AP judges, Donn Parson, director of graduate study in
the University of Kansas' Department of Communication Studies,
said, ``Dukakis did a very poor job in answering the foreign policy
issues. Bush made good use of Dukakis' support for a nuclear
freeze.''
   James J. Unger, director of the National Forensics Institute at
American University in Washington and chairman of the AP panel,
said, ``George Bush won it. ... Dukakis' concern for an election
breakthrough too often led to a debate breakdown on issues such as
deficit control, defense policy and social programs.''
   William Southworth, director of forensics and professor of
speech at the University of Redlands, Calif., said it was
``catastrophic'' that Dukakis could not counter Bush's argument
that you must negotiate out of strength with the Russians. The
question was raised ``about six different ways ... and Dukakis
still had no answer,'' Southworth said.
   Melissa Maxcy Wade, the director of forensics at Emory
University in Atlanta, said, ``Bush was playing a foreign policy
theme, a world peace theme that went through the whole thing. ...
Bush is not an organized debater, but tonight his confidence made a
difference.''
   Steven P. Mancuso, director of intercollegiate forensics for the
University of Michigan, the sole judge to pick Dukakis, said he
thought the Massachusetts governor ``successfully countered Bush's
use of the label `liberal' ... and painted Bush as being
complacent.''
   James M. Copeland, national executive secretary of the National
Forensic League in Ripon, Wis., said, ``At the end of the debate,
whether you liked it or didn't like it, you knew what Bush's
position was. ... Dukakis just seemed to lack focus.''
   Copeland added, ``The whole debate was truly a mess. As a debate
coach for 25 years, I'm sorry to say that Bush certainly spoke the
truth when he said there should be no more debates. There certainly
should be no more like this last one.''
   The AP judges last week called Democrat Lloyd Bentsen the
winner, 148-125, over Republican Dan Quayle in their vice
presidential debate.
   The judges watched the debate on television, using a scorecard
modeled after the American Forensic Association Debate Ballot for
collegiate and scholastic debates.
   They awarded one to five points in each of six categories:
reasoning, evidence, organization, refutation, cross-examination
and presentation. A 1 was poor; 2 fair; 3 average; 4 excellent, and
5 superior.
   Each judge could award a maximum of 30 points. A perfect score
would have been 180.
   Here are the candidates' combined scores:

<TEXT>
   Ian Smith, Rhodesia's last white prime
minister, remains convinced nearly a decade later that he was right
to fight a futile and bloody battle to avert black rule in what is
now Zimbabwe.
   ``You think just because I haven't been killed, there's a
democracy?'' Smith says of his southern African homeland.
   Zimbabwe is widely regarded as a black African success story
under President Robert Mugabe, the guerrilla leader who took over
in 1980 in a British-mediated settlement granting independence to
its last African colony.
   Smith once grabbed world headlines but now lectures to small
audiences. In Brighton, a few hundred white Rhodesian emigres and
members of pro-South African lobbies gathered at a fringe meeting
organized by right-wing legislator John Carlisle during this week's
annual convention of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative Party.
   Mugabe's permission of his old arch-enemy to stay in Zimbabwe
with his wife and children is seen as a sign of magnanimity.
   ``Maybe there's a certain amount of reciprocity,'' says Smith.
``According to our laws, Mugabe and (ex-guerrilla leader Joshua)
Nkomo and the rest of them should have been killed by us and I
didn't kill them.''
   Smith was born in Rhodesia and grew up staunchly loyal to
Britain. He served as a Royal Air Force fighter pilot in World War
II. His face is still partially paralyzed by war wounds.
   But when Britain began dismantling its African empire and
pressure mounted for black majority rule in Rhodesia, Smith led his
country to secede from Britain. The price for Rhodesia's 6.7
million blacks and 275,000 whites was 15 years of punitive
international sanctions and a seven-year civil war that cost 30,000
lives.
   Now the gaunt, graying figure has sallied out from his farm in
central Zimbabwe to add a personally risky footnote to his
oft-written political obituary.
   A year ago Smith was suspended from Zimbabwe's Parliament, where
he held one of a handful of seats reserved for whites. These have
since been abolished and Smith has resigned.
   He was suspended for making supportive remarks about neighboring
white-ruled South Africa. Some of Mugabe's associates are calling
for a ban on him returning home from his present lecture tour in
the United States and Britain.
   In his speech, the sense of grievance, the certainty of being
right in a hostile world, is unshaken. Smith denounces sanctions
against South Africa, recalls ruefully embargoes against Rhodesia
and talks about communist subversion and terrorist incursions.
   The audience rises in an emotional ovation, and admirers surge
forward to shake his hand. Just for a moment, nothing seems to have
changed for the politician who once said Rhodesia would not have
black rule ``in a thousand years.''
   At 69, Smith is a man with no visible signs of self-doubt.
   But two-thirds of the white minority he led have left the
country, while some of his close white political associates now
belong to Mugabe's governing party.
   ``Perhaps it was convenient,'' he says.
   Lord Carrington, who as British foreign secretary devised the
peace settlement, wrote in memoirs published last month that during
the negotiations he told an impatient Smith: ``Perhaps you might
recollect that but for you nobody in Rhodesia would be being
killed.''
   Smith denies Carrington said it. ``But even if he had said it, I
would have reminded him that the first terrorist incursions across
our border were in 1961 ... and they killed innocent civilians and
children.''
   As he turns to leave, there's a hint that Smith suspects he may
not end his days in the country where he was born.
   ``It's my country. There's been five generations of my family in
Zimbabwe. I hope I can go on living there, but there may be
circumstances of course which preclude that. I love the country.''

<TEXT>
   After a week of riots that left hundreds
dead, President Chadli Bendjedid has unveiled a series of reforms
that he says will allow Algerians to change the constitution and
bring this restless nation closer to democracy.
   Bendjedid announced the measures, including a Nov. 3 referendum
that could end the only legal political party's grip on power,
after lifting a six-day state of emergency and curfew imposed as
riots swept the country.
   Despite Wednesday's announcement, however, new reports said at
least 10 people were killed during demonstrations in Tizi-Ouzou,
the provincial capital of Kabylie, in the Berber region about 10
miles east of Algiers.
   An estimated 176 people have been slain during six days of
rioting, according to Information Minister Bachir Rouiz. But
unofficial totals set the number of dead at more than 500, with
more than 1,000 injured.
   More than 3,000 demonstrators and agitators rounded up by police
were being held in temporary detention centers.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse reported that about
10 people were slain Wednesday following a clash between pro- and
anti-Bendjedid demonstrators in Tizi-Ouzou.
   The agency said anti-Bendjedid demonstrators joined a march by a
group supporting the president, then moved toward a police station
where police were gathering. It said shots were fired shortly
before 4 p.m., and 10 people were slain.
   The district governor of Tizi-Ouzou, Amara Ahmed Salah, denied
there were casualties and said security forces fired only warning
shots, AFP said.
   Algeria's ambassador to France, Messaoud Ait-Chaalal, also
denied on French television that people were killed. Any injuries,
he said, ``were the result of groups of demonstrators among
themselves.''
   The reports came as Bendjedid set forth a three-point plan for
``greater democratization,'' according to Algeria's official news
agency.
   The first step calls for a Nov. 3 referendum for voters to
consider a constitutional change making the prime minister, named
by the president, answerable to Algeria's parliament.
   The prime minister would have enormously increased power,
without interference from the sole legal party, the National
Liberation Front.
   Currently, the prime minister has no specified duties under the
constitution and the parliament is widely regarded as a
rubber-stamp assembly. The current premier is the Front's Abdelhami
Brahimi.
   As a second step, Bendjedid announced measures for a ``greater
democratization of political action,'' to be placed before the
congress of the ruling party before the end of the year. He did not
elaborate.
   As a final step, Algerians would be asked to approve, in another
referendum, modifications these changes would bring to the nation's
constitution. No date was announced for this referendum.
   The reforms were announced two days after the president promised
the nation, in a televised address, that demands would be met with
economic and political reforms.
   Bendjedid predicted major changes in the Algerian leadership to
rid the nation of ``people who were not at the height of their
duties,'' but he gave no details.
   The unrest, which began Oct. 4, was spurred by Algeria's
economic crisis. Demonstrators protested food shortages and rising
prices and demanded an end to Bendjedid's austerity program.
   Algeria's hobbled economy was further weakened by the fall in
oil prices. More than 95 percent of the country's exports come from
oil and natural gas.
   In addition, government officials have admitted that a
demographic explosion does not augur well for this nation of 25
million people, 60 percent of whom are under 20 years of age.

   The third fire to hit the downtown Central
Library in less than three years was a freak accident caused by
construction materials ignited by a welding torch during
renovation, a Fire Department official said Wednesday.
   The fire late Tuesday afternoon occurred as the 62-year-old
library was undergoing a $152 million renovation following two
disastrous arson fires that destroyed hundreds of thousands of
books in 1986.
   The material was cut by a welding torch on the fourth floor and
dropped through a hole into the basement where it ignited a large
rubbish pile, said Inspector Ed Reed.
   The Fire Department termed it a ``freak accident,'' Reed said.
``All precautions were being observed by the company on the site.
It's highly unlikely that it will occur again.''
   The fire was confined to the northwest corner of the basement
but smoke spread throughout the building. Reed said there did not
appear to be any structural damage. The extent of potential damage
to the library's huge murals, which were being cleaned of the smoke
damage from the 1986 blazes, was being determined.
   Except for the murals, all the library's books and other
valuables had long since been removed for the renovation.

   A woman who used her retirement money to
buy thousands of defective rubber gloves in an attempt to exploit
the growing concern over AIDS admits her business judgment was full
of holes.
   Today, 60-year-old Justine Spiros has 600,000 latex gloves in
her basement, and apparently no way to get rid of them _ let alone
recover her $61,000 outlay to buy them in the first place.
   The grandmother of five said she first realized her business
venture might be getting out of hand when she started looking for
samples to send to prospective customers.
   ``I found gloves with fingers off, with big holes, tears,
stains, streaks and lumps,'' Ms. Spiros recalled recently.
   Things went downhill from there.
   Ms. Spiros can't sell the gloves because huge numbers are
defective, and the seller won't give her a refund.
   She can't even throw them away because the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration is investigating her problem and may impound them.
   ``I wake up at 3:30 in the morning worrying,'' she said. ``It's
such a horrible situation.''
   Ms. Spiros got into the business because with growing concern
about blood-transmitted diseases _ especially AIDS _ demand for
gloves was high and supply was short.
   She already was marketing disposable electrodes out of a home
office that features a washer-dryer alongside a copying machine,
and sanitary gloves looked like a hot new area.
   ``Everyone wanted gloves,'' Ms. Spiros recalled. ``No one could
get enough. I figured they'd sell immediately.''
   She borrowed $41,000 from her own retirement account to cover
part of the cost of her first shipment of 600 cartons.
   After having problems finding enough good samples to use in
drumming up business, Ms. Spiros was forced to recall the one and
only shipment that ever left the basement _ 2,000 gloves sent to a
San Francisco-area ambulance company.
   She hasn't considered her next step, but she's certain no more
gloves will leave her door.
   ``I have my reputation to think of,'' Ms. Spiros said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON Today: Democratic Push on Social Security Is An October
Habit</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a simple, stinging campaign ad _ a pair
of hands tearing up a Social Security card.
   That was 24 years ago, and Barry Goldwater still recalls it with
anger, saying in his memoirs that it was ``a repellent lie'' for
the Democrats to charge he would have destroyed Social Security if
he had been elected president in 1964.
   There's a somewhat milder reprise of that television ad in this
campaign, as Democrat Michael Dukakis tries to cast Vice President
George Bush in the Goldwater role.
   It shows a Social Security card with pieces disappearing while
Republican Bush is accused of favoring benefit cuts. ``Vote for the
man you know will protect Social Security and make sure it's there
when you need it,'' the Dukakis campaign commercial urges.
   The issue is back, with the volume relatively low so far but
with the Democrats likely to turn it up in the waning days of the
campaign. A push on Social Security hardly would qualify as an
October surprise. It has become an October habit.
   Dukakis raised the Social Security flag in his first debate with
Bush on Sept. 25, asserting that ``if he's serious about what he's
saying, then the only place he can go to balance that budget is to
raid the Social Security trust fund and he tried that in 1985 and I
think he's going to try it again.''
   The topic may come up again tonight as Bush and Dukakis meet in
their second and final campaign debate.
   Both presidential nominees have declared Social Security off
limits in budget-cutting efforts. Bush specifically exempts it from
his proposed ``flexible freeze'' budget plan.
   But that fits the tested Democratic theme, which is to argue
that Republicans always say they are solidly behind Social Security
before the election, and renege afterward.
   Democratic Sen. Lloyd Benten spelled that out in the vice
presidential debate. ``I know too well what their track record is
... and we should be concerned about that kind of an effort once
again after the election is over.''
   Bentsen accused Sen. Dan Quayle, Bush's running mate, of voting
eight times to cut Social Security benefits. Quayle replied that
what he'd voted for, and what Bentsen himself had twice voted for,
was to delay cost-of-living increases.
   Bush voted in 1985 to break a Senate tie and impose a one-year
freeze on increases in Social Security benefits. In the end,
nothing was frozen.
   Dukakis supported a 1985 National Governors' Association policy
statement that included a freeze in Social Security cost-of-living
increases. The Dukakis campaign says the Massachusetts governor
first voted for an amendment that would have exempted Social
Security, but his side lost. None of it was binding anyhow.
   So there is enough history, and enough ambiguity on both sides
to push most other topics off the campaign agenda. Not this one.
   Bush is trying to anticipate, and undercut, the long-tested
Democratic issue by calling it more of the same. ``Here again, my
opponent is using what can only be described as irresponsible scare
tactics _ the same shopworn ones his party trots out every time
they fall behind, usually about three weeks before an election,''
he said in Seattle on Monday.
   It may look shopworn, but is also is shop-proven. After the
Republicans lost control of the Senate in 1986, Sen. Bob Dole of
Kansas blamed the loss of the majority he had led on the Democrats'
chorused campaign on the Social Security issue.
   The Republican administration had sought to slow cost-of-living
increases, and had recommended reductions in ancillary benefits,
rearming Democrats on the issue. It has been a troublesome topic
for President Reagan since he came to national politics _ after
calling Social Security the flagship of the liberal cause and
siding with 1964 Goldwater suggestions that it be made voluntary.
   Writing about his own campaign in his new book, ``Goldwater,''
the former Arizona senator said the point he tried to make was that
Social Security was not actuarily sound, a point Reagan repeated
during his 1976 and 1980 Republican campaign. That argument was
better mathematically than politically.
   Goldwater also warned that Social Security taxes would
inevitably escalate and would one day rival the burden of federal
income taxes for many Americans. That seemed improbable in 1964,
but not now.
   President Ford took on the issue in 1975, proposing ceilings
that would have curbed Social Security cost-of-living increases by
almost half, and telling Congress that it would have to restrain
that and other transfer payments, programs in which the government
makes payments to individuals. He got nowhere.
   A month ago, Robert Strauss, co-chairman of a bipartisan
commission that will offer economic advice to the incoming
president, said that if deficits really are to be eliminated ``we
have to go to Social Security, Medicare and entitlements
generally,'' along with defense spending curbs. Strauss is a
veteran Democratic campaigner and fund-raiser, and a former party
chairman.
   He later said that wasn't a commission idea but, rather, his own
view of the cold, hard truth.
   The hard political truth is that neither candidate is going to
permit, let alone propose, any talk of significant curbs or changes
in Social Security. It's a given.
   Quayle made that point after accusing debate rival Bentsen of
trying to scare the elderly on the issue.
   ``This program is not a Republican program, it's not a
Democratic program,'' Quayle said. ``It's a program for older
Americans that program is actuarily sound to the turn of this
century.''

<HEAD>77-Year-Old Woman Survives Eight Days in Ravine Beside Dead
Husband</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 77-year-old woman spent eight days
trapped in a ravine beside her dead husband after their vehicle
plunged off a highway, but she managed to survive the ordeal.
   Helen Heinrich was listed in critical condition Wednesday, three
days after she was rescued by three men who were looking for
crayfish in a nearby creek.
   Heinrich was driving home from breakfast in Santa Cruz with her
husband of 55 years, Rudolph, when the brakes failed and their car
plunged off the highway into a wooded ravine, she told Highway
Patrol officers in a bedside interview.
   Rudolph Heinrich, 83, died of massive internal injuries shortly
after the crash, authorities said.
   Before she was rescued, Helen Heinrich managed to survive
without food or water for eight days, lapsing in and out of
consciousness.
   One of three men who stumbled upon the wreck said the woman
seemed paralyzed when they found her.
   ``Her eyes were open and blinking and the fingers on her right
hand were moving,'' said Mike Schaffer, 19. ``Otherwise, she was
doing nothing.''
   ``I don't think anyone would have found them for a long time if
we hadn't just happened to go down there,'' he said.
   No one could see the car from the road because of heavy brush,
said police Officer William Waterhouse.
   Officers initially thought the woman had lain injured for only
one day next to her dead husband, but an investigation and
interview with Heinrich, who first remembered the crash Tuesday,
revealed the extent of her ordeal.
   After the car plunged 120 feet Sunday, it tumbled, rolled and
came to rest on its wheels, Waterhouse said.
   Heinrich, who suffered internal injuries, cuts and bruises and a
fractured elbow, crawled out of the wreck and collapsed, said
Waterhouse. When she was found, she was weak and extremely
dehydrated.
   ``She's a strong woman and she just hung on,'' he said. A
spokesman at San Jose Medical Center said Heinrich's most serious
medical concern is kidney trouble related to the dehydration.

   For months, news reports in Britain and the United States have
said carbon-14 tests conducted by three laboratories determined the
shroud was made in the 14th century.
   Professor Luigi Gonella, scientific adviser to the Cardinal of
Turin, said late last month he was told the news reports were
correct.
   But he said at the time that Roman Catholic Church officials
still had not seen the results and were angry because they were
being ``accused of trying to hide the results, accused of taking
part in a conspiracy to hide the truth, of being afraid of the
truth.''
   The archdiocese in Turin said Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero
will release the results of the tests at a news conference today
attended by Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro.
   The shroud _ 14 feet, 3 inches long and 3 feet, 7 inches wide _
bears a faint yellowish negative image of the front and back of a
man whipped, speared, nailed to a cross and crowned with thorns.
   For centuries it has been revered by some as the burial cloth of
Jesus and dismissed by others as a clever forgery.
   The Roman Catholic Church never claimed the shroud was a holy
relic but treated it with respect because of the possibility it
could be.
   Laboratories at the University of Arizona, the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology at the University of Zurich and Oxford
University conducted the carbon-14 tests on postage-stamp size
pieces of linen snipped from the shroud in April.
   The tests give a scientific basis for the age of the shroud but
do nothing to solve the enduring riddle of how the image was
created.
   American scientists who subjected the linen to its most rigorous
chemical, computer and photographic analysis concluded in 1981 that
it was ``a real human form of a whipped and crucified man and not
the product of an artist.''
   They speculated it resulted from chemical changes in the linen
while it was in contact with a body. Such changes could be
duplicated to a degree in the laboratory, they said. But they added
no method could adequately explain the shroud's image.
   Gonella bristled last month at news reports that a medieval date
for the shroud meant it was a fake or a fraud.
   ``It could be a genuine work of Christian art,'' he said.
   The carbon-14 tests were supposed to be conducted as a blind
study. Each of the three laboratories was given one piece of the
shroud and one piece of linen with a known date. The labs were not
to know which was which, but the distinctive herringbone pattern of
the shroud could have given its sample away.
   Scientists have said the triple carbon dating should reveal the
age of the cloth within a 200-year range.
   The first mention of the possible existence of Christ's shroud
came from French crusader Robert of Clari who wrote that he saw it
in 1203 in the imperial palace in Constantinople.
   But the first actual records of the Shroud of Turin trace it
only to Lirey, France in 1354.
   The shroud was bequeathed to the pope by former King Umberto II
of Italy upon his death in 1983.

   Military bases built to protect stagecoach
routes from attacking Indians or the nation's East Coast from
British gunboats may finally be closed under legislation which the
Pentagon says could save up to $5 billion a year.
   ``Congress handed, begrudgingly, the administration an axe. They
shouldn't hesitate to cut the dead wood from our domestic basing
structure,'' said Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, chief author of the
bill.
   The measure easily cleared the House and Senate on Wednesday and
was sent to President Reagan, who is expected to sign it.
   The Pentagon estimates that $2 billion to $5 billion a year can
be saved if it is permitted to pare down the list of 3,800 U.S.
military installations.
   The bill sets up a complicated procedure which essentially cuts
through the thicket of laws enacted by Congress. Legislators,
loathe to permit the loss of jobs which accompanies base closings,
have blocked any facilities from being shut in the last 11 years.
   ``It's been 28 years since we've had a two-term }O@LlOZO@_greater than_
leaving the White House while the other party
controlled Congress,'' said Armey. ``Only under this political
configuration could a base-closing bill like this get through
Congress.''
   The bill endorses a Pentagon-appointed commission which has been
meeting for months, trying to put together a list of bases to be
closed. The current panel would be expanded to 12 members by the
bill.
   The panel will make its recommendations by Dec. 31 and Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci would have until Jan. 15 _ five days
before he leaves office _ to either accept or reject the entire
list. If Carlucci approves, Congress would have until mid-April to
overturn the proposal, but only by approving a resolution which
could then be vetoed by the incoming president.
   No base closures would begin before 1990.
   Among the bases long cited by critics as facilities which should
be closed are Fort Douglas, Utah, built more than a century ago to
protect stagecoach routes; Fort Monroe, Va., built inside a moat to
defend against the British invasion in the War of 1812; and Fort
Sheridan, Ill., where the major features are a golf course and two
beaches on Lake Michigan.
   Another potential facility which may be closed could be Loring
Air Force Base in northern Maine, a Strategic Air Command base
which the Air Force proposed closing in 1975.
   It was that proposal which prompted Congress to erect stiff
hurdles against base closings. None of Maine's four-member
congressional delegation voted for the bill Wednesday as the Senate
approved it, 82-7, and the House voted for it 370-31.
   Before the plan to close Loring aroused congressional opposition
in 1977, the Pentagon generally was allowed to do as it pleased in
trimming the mobilization stemming from World War II. Between 1961
and 1977, the Defense Department closed 3,600 installations.
   ``We are addressing one of the great sacred cows in this country
and in this body,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   ``There is something in the heart of every politician that loves
a dam, or a harbor, or a bridge, or a military installation,''
Gramm said. ``Though they may hate the purpose, though they may
vote against defense, they want the money coming into the area and
they defend to the death the continuation of a base.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
said, ``We know we cannot afford excess bases that we don't need,
(but) we all also understand the reality and the sensitivity of the
communities in America that are so dependent, in some cases, on
these bases, at least in the short run, and we know that reflects
itself here in the Congress.''
   Armey said, ``the beauty of this bill is that it protects
individual members of Congress from political punishment at home
and from political intimidation from the administration.''
   ``I'm sure the list will include bases in Democrat districts,
Republican districts, conservative and liberal districts,'' he said.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said, ``I have no idea'' whether the commission
will recommend the closing of any of the numerous bases in Virginia.
   But Warner pledged that ``I'm willing to take the heat if it
becomes a matter of necessity in my own state, if one of these
installations has to be closed in order to cut the waste from the
national defense.''

<HEAD>Reagan Threatens Special Session Over Contras</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan plans to summon Congress into
a special session to vote on renewed military aid to the Nicaraguan
Contras if he believes the Sandinista government is moving to mop
up remnants of the rebel forces.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, speaking with reporters
Wednesday evening, confirmed earlier reports by sources that Reagan
had settled on a special session as his conditional plan for
seeking new military aid for the Contras.
   Fitzwater described it as a fall-back position to ensure the
Contras' survival into the next U.S. administration, should
Nicaragua's leftist government attack the remnants of the rebel
movement in an effort to eradicate it.
   The White House spokesman acknowledged that there is no chance
to obtain further money for the rebels before the 100th Congress
adjourns. Lawmakers are eager to return home to campaign, and hope
to complete their regular session by the week's end.
   Reagan has the power under the Constitution to call Congress
back to Washington after adjournment. If he thought it necessary to
save the Contras, he would ask Congress to release $16.5 million in
stockpiled weaponry now stored in Honduran warehouses, Fitzwater
said.
   Reagan is expected to make the threat in a statement as early as
today, according to well-placed sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity. They said it is intended as a dual message to Congress
and to the Sandinistas that the president will be scrutinizing
activities in Nicaragua during the remainder of the year when
Congress will not be in session.
   ``The point is to send the message, `Don't you try anything,
'cause I ain't leaving town,'' said one source familiar with White
House planning.
   Under a Pentagon money bill Reagan signed earlier this month, a
procedure was established for expedited congressional consideration
of a new request for military aid for the rebels.
   Despite the gestures, support for the Contras remains at a low
ebb in Congress and even their strongest supporters question
whether the rebels could ever be regrouped into an effective
fighting force.
   From a peak of nearly 18,000 rebel troops inside Nicaragua early
this year, the number has dwindled to fewer than 2,000, according
to intelligence estimates.
   ``They are now reduced to refugee status,'' said Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill.
   Many of the rebels have fled to camps just inside neighboring
Honduras, and others have scattered elsewhere.
   Reagan's hope is to keep up Contra morale and preserve the
potential for reviving the rebels if vice president George Bush
wins his presidential campaign and wants to continue to make the
Contras an arm of his Central America policy, according to the
sources. Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis opposes use of the
Contras as a foreign policy tool.
   The Contras have been without U.S. military support since
February, when it was ended in deference to efforts to forge a
long-term cease-fire between the two sides. The rebels now are
receiving some $27 million in humanitarian aid under the Pentagon
appropriations measure.
   Under the law, Reagan could trigger an expedited vote on the
stockpiled weaponry if he certifies to Congress that two of three
conditions are met: that the Soviet Union continues to funnel
unacceptable levels of military hardware to the Sandinistas; that
the leftist government is violating terms of a regional peace
accord; or that the Sandinistas have launched an unprovoked attack
on the rebels.
   Administration officials maintain that the first two of those
conditions already exist. ``The president will say if anything
approaching the third (condition) occurs, I will call Congress back
into session,'' said one source familiar with the White House
planning.
   ``The idea is to send as strong a warning as he possibly can,''
the source said.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a Contra supporter, is expected to
offer an amendment to an anti-drug measure now before the Senate
that would reiterate the warning to the Sandinistas and express
congressional willingness to go along with new military aid if
developments warrant, Capitol Hill sources said.
   ``It's the right kind of signal to send to (Nicaraguan
President) Daniel Ortega and the Democrats wh3vtra aid,'' said
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``The issue hasn't gone
away. The president is right to insist that it stay a priority on
the national stage.''

<TEXT>
   Sundstrand Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to
federal fraud charges and pay a $115 million settlement for
overbilling the Pentagon for airplane parts over seven years,
federal prosecutors said Wednesday.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said the settlement includes ``tens
of millions of dollars'' in penalties against the Rockford-based
aerospace contractor.
   ``You have a company that set out to defraud the government,''
he said at a news conference. ``The only way that type of activity
can be deterred is through swift legal action.''
   Valukas would not estimate the cost of Sundstrand's actions to
the government.
   A further investigation of individuals at Sundstrand will be
completed in two or three months, he said, noting the plea
agreement calls for the company to cooperate in that probe.
   Evans W. Erikson, Sundstrand chairman and chief executive
officer, said the plea agreement was a ``major step toward putting
this unfortunate chapter behind the company.''
   A letter from Erikson distributed to Sundstrand employees
Wednesday explained the agreement and told them ``every employee is
reponsible for conducting business activities in a manner that does
credit to Sundstrand.''
   Sundstrand makes flight-data equipment, engine start-up systems
and other electronic equipment for military and commercial aircraft.
   The Defense Department accounts for 42 percent of the company's
$1.4 billion in annual sales.
   ``Sundstrand has provided a good-quality product for a long
period of time. Unfortunately, we've been paying too much for it,''
Francis Holland, regional commander of Defense Contract
Administration Services, said at the news conference.
   Sundstrand may be barred from further contracts with the Defense
Department pending an investigation, spokesman Larry Wilson of the
department's Defense Logistics Agency said from Washington.
   Wilson said before the company would do business with the
government again the Defense Department would check changes in
Sundstrand's accounting system that would prevent a recurrence.
Also, he said any high-ranking officers involved in the defraud
should be suspended.
   Sundstrand has agreed to plead guilty to a four-count criminal
information produced by a federal grand jury in Rockford.
   The document accuses the company of submitting intentionally low
bids on contracts from 1980 to 1986 and then concealing the extra
costs in general overhead costs.
   ``In essence, if Sundstrand had a $100 million bid on a contract
(that cost $150 million) and had a fixed price for that bid, the
additional $50 million in overruns were hidden in the overhead
account and billed improperly back to the government in a concealed
fashion,'' Valukas said.
   The company also was accused by the grand jury of conspiring to
undermine the contract-bidding process by spending more than
$100,000 on Defense Department personnel, buying liquor, meals,
theater tickets and related items in efforts to gain greater access
to them.
   Some government employees are being investigated for allegedly
accepting the gratuities, Wilson said.
   Another count accused the company of defrauding the Internal
Revenue Service by writing off as ``scrap'' parts it had shipped to
another company.
   The fourth count said the company had billed as ``general and
administrative costs'' charges for liquor, babysitting, saunas,
country club dues and other amenities for its executives.
   In its annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
earlier this year, Sundstrand said the ``government has advised
that it intends to charge the company with criminal violations'' in
Rockford and Seattle.
   Sundstrand operates a subsidiary, part of its Advanced
Technology Group, in Redmond, Wash., near Seattle.
   The agreement announced in Chicago resolved the Rockford
violations, Valukas said. Sundstrand also agreed to pay an
additional settlement of $1.02 million to resolve a criminal
investigation of its Seattle-area subsidiary, the company said.
   The company said it already had paid $11.3 million ``to settle
administratively all other outstanding government accounting
disputes involving Sundstrand Data Control Inc.,'' its subsidiary
in Washington state.
   Sundstrand began putting money in reserve two years ago to cover
settlement costs and legal expenses.

<HEAD>Two Percent Gain in Corn and Soybean Harvests Estimated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This fall's corn harvest is expected to total
4.55 billion bushels, or 2 percent more than the Agriculture
Department had forecast last month.
   The newest estimate is still 36 percent below last year's crop
total, reflecting the fierce drought that hammered the midcontinent
over the summer.
   Soybean production should be about 1.5 billion bushels, the
Agriculture Department's Agricultural Statistics Board said
Wednesday.
   That also represented a 2 percent upturn compared to last
month's estimate. The latest figures were based on surveys made
Oct. 1.
   A month ago, USDA estimated corn production at 4.46 billion
bushels and soybean production at 1.47 billion bushels.
   Corn is the largest and most important crop grown by American
farmers and as a feed is essential to meat, poultry and dairy
production.
   Soybeans, which provide high-protein meal and quality vegetable
oil used in food processing, also are vital to U.S. food production.
   Wheat production was reported at 1.8 billion bushels, about the
same as last month.
   The average yield for corn was estimated at 80.2 bushels per
acre. That represented a steep drop from last year's figure of
119.4 bushels per acre.
   The report said the ``all crops'' production index as of Oct. 1
averaged 89 percent of the base year of 1977, up 1 percent from
September.
   Crop production averaged 106 percent of the base last year. The
record was 117 percent reached in 1981, 1982 and 1985.

   A new coalition of farm and environmental
groups is calling for reduced spraying of chemical pesticides on
crops.
   ``We are drenching our food and drowning the nation in an ever
increasing amount of ag chemicals,'' said John O'Connor, director
of the newly launched National Toxics Coalition.
   The coalition whose supporters include the American Agriculture
Movement and the National Farmers Union is placing special stress
on supply management in crop production as a prelude to scaling
back pesticide use.
   Under a supply management system, limits would be placed on how
much each farmer could take to market. Farm prices would go up and
offset production losses resulting from cutbacks in pesticide use.
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, is probably the best known Capitol Hill
advocate of a supply management system, which would mark a sharp
departure from most current farm programs. The idea was shelved
early in this session of Congress but most likely will get another
airing after lawmakers return in January.
   Environmentalists have been campaigning for 26 years for curbs
on the use of pesticides, citing among other things evidence that
more than 50 of the basic ingredients in pesticides cause cancer in
laboratory animals.
   A bare-bones pesticide bill won approval last month but even
supporters of the measure say more needs to be done in the next
Congress.
   Coalition members call the joining of forces by farm and
environmental groups in the pesticide battle a major step forward.
Not taking part, however, are the American Farm Bureau and most
traditional farm groups as well as politically influential producer
groups such as the corn, soybean and wheat grower associations.
   The coalition issued a 35-page report, which reviewed the
problem and called for integrated pest management programs,
involving scouting fields to make sure spraying does not take place
unnecessarily, reduced spraying and tilling procedures designed to
reduce damage from pests.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group distributed a
report saying congressional candidates received $4 million in
campaign contributions from pesticide manufacturers over the last
five years.
   It said heavy contributions were received by members of the
Senate Agriculture Committee and suggested a ``strong correlation
between chemical company ... contributions to a politician and that
politician's vote on regulation of the chemical industry.''
   Group spokesman Rick Hind said the companies were ``applying
agricultural techniques to Capitol Hill _ they sow campaign
contributions and reap legislation that allows them to operate with
minimal government oversight.''

   A tobacco-state congressman is calling for an
FBI investigation of tobacco exports wrongly certified as 100
percent American and then sent overseas under government credit
guarantees.
   ``The harm that this corrupt blending practice has caused the
American tobacco farmer is inestimable,'' Rep. Robin Tallon,
D-S.C., said in a letter Wednesday to Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh.
   The credit guarantees are supposed to be available only for
American tobacco exports. Under the program, the government would
pay if the overseas purchaser failed to provide the exporter with
his money.
   Congressional and USDA investigators found that 14 of 19
exporters monitored sent shipments under the program that were
certified as 100 percent American but which actually were blends of
U.S. and foreign tobaccos.
   Tallon acknowledged in an interview that the U.S. attorney's
office in Raleigh, N.C., which already is investigating the case,
most likely could call on the FBI for help if needed. But he said
he was unsure if there was a sizeable enough staff in Raleigh. He
said it was important to call on Thornburgh for a full-scale probe.
   ``The question begs to be answered: Who's trying to cover up
what?'' Tallon said. ``I'm saying, bring in the FBI and see if
anyone else gets caught in the loop.''

<HEAD>Economists: Boost Savings And Investment Or See US Influence Wane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American living standards and world influence
will decline unless the next president sets ambitious national
goals to boost savings and investment, a group of leading
economists said today.
   The seven economists, led by Nobel Prize winner Robert Solow
called for a a new ``investment economics'' to replace the
supply-side economics of the Reagan years.
   ``Such an economics would, for the first time, see America set
the great national goal of matching our competitors' savings and
investments rates by the year 2000,'' the economists said in a
``White Paper on America's Future.''
   ``If current trends continue into the 1990s, America could at
best face a Great Britain-like scenario of generations of gradual
decline in relative living standards and national influence,'' the
economists wrote. ``At worst, our present path could provoke a
financial crisis and dramatic reduction in domestic and global
well-being.''
   The economists said the mountain of debt the country has run up
in the 1980s, both as a result of the federal budget deficits and
the huge trade deficits, threatened America's future standard of
living.
   ``We are unaware of any historical precedent that has seen a
nation indefinitely borrow and consume its way to prosperity. And
we note that the world today is filled with the descendants of
once-great powers that tried this path and failed,'' the economists
said.
   They said their proposal should be seen as an alternative to
supply-side economics, which attempted to boost investment
indirectly by cutting marginal tax rates, or older economic
theories which tried to boost investment indirectly through
boosting demand.
   The national agenda the economists recommended would set a goal
by the year 2000 of matching the 11 percent national savings rate
of the United States' biggest economic competitor, Japan. In 1986,
net savings in the United States hit a low in the post-World War II
period of 1.7 percent, one-tenth of the Japanese rate. It edged up
only slightly to 2 percent of total economic output last year.
   The economists said it was critical to boost total savings to
provide the capital American businesses need to invest in new plant
and equipment and boost U.S. productivity.
   One primary way to boost savings is to reduce the federal budget
deficit since the deficits represent a large drain on financial
markets, the economists said.
   They said the budget deficit, which totaled an estimated $150
billion in the fiscal year which ended Sept. 30, should be reduced
by $40 billion in the current fiscal year with similar reductions
in following years.
   The economists also called on policies to boost business
investment, increase savings by individuals and increase government
spending on education to upgrade the quality of the American
workforce.
   In addition to Solow, other economists who worked on the report
were Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of the WEFA Group, a private
economic consulting firm; Pat Choate, top economist at TRW; Paul
Krugman; Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor;
Robert Reich, Harvard economics professor; Lester Thurow, dean of
the MIT business school, and Laura Tyson, economics professor at
the University of California at Berkeley.
   A book published Wednesday by the Council on Foreign Relations
also pinpointed the critical need for the next president to reduce
the federal budget deficit, saying any delay could threaten
disastrous results for the United States on world financial markets.
   ``The next president will face more difficult constraints and
more difficult choices than any of his predecessors over the last
40 years,'' said C. Michael Aho, one of the authors of ``After
Reagan: Confronting the Changed World Economy.''
   ``If he doesn't have a credible economic policy, markets could
react, sending the dollar plunging and interest rates soaring,''
Aho told reporters at a briefing.
   Aho and his co-author, Marc Levinson, pointed to the worldwide
collapse of stock markets last Oct. 19 as a warning of what can
happen if investors lose confidence.
   ``We are going to have to slow down our excess consumption and
start servicing our debt,'' he said.
   The authors recommended cutting the federal budget deficit over
the next four years through a combination of tax increases and cuts
in defense spending and benefit programs such as Social Security
and Medicare.

   A House-approved government ethics bill
contains the first-ever restrictions on lobbying by former members
of Congress, and the bill's sponsor says Senate approval is likely.
   The restrictions are contained in legislation to tighten federal
rules against influence peddling by former top officials of the
government.
   The House passed the measure 374-19 on Wednesday, sending it to
the Senate. Approval in that chamber is 90 percent likely, said
Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., the bill's author.
   Frank said ``some of the senior members aren't too excited about
the bill. But there is a sense that it is not right for Congress to
apply laws to others from which it is exempt.''
   For the first time, conflict-of-interest rules would be applied
to members of Congress and their top staff members.
   Former members and their staffs would be banned for one year
from contacting the legislative house in which they served. The
bill would cover lobbying, along with any communication done for
pay to influence federal decisions, including writing letters,
filing motions, or seeking grants.
   The legislation also proposes a lifetime ban on former executive
branch members from advising anyone on a matter in which the
employee was ``personally and substantially'' involved.
   The changes are aimed at closing the ``revolving door'' through
which government employees leave for higher-paid civilian jobs
based on access to their former government colleagues.
   The most often-cited example is that of Michael K. Deaver,
President Reagan's former chief of staff, who began lobbying the
White House for his clients shortly after he resigned from the
government.
   Deaver was convicted of lying about his lobbying activities, but
never was charged with substantive violations of the current law
restricting post-employment lobbying in the executive branch. He
was sentenced to three years' probation and 1,500 hours of
community service, and fined $100,000.
   ``This is a very collegial place; we work with each other every
day,'' Frank said. ``I don't want to go from working with someone
one day to being lobbied by them the next day. We're talking about
a cooling-off period _ a transition time before we change
relationships.''
   Opponents said the restrictions were too broad and argued that
there had been no examples of abuses or improper influence being
wielded by former lawmakers.
   The bill would create exemptions from the lobbying ban for
former lawmakers who make speeches or offer personal advice to
former colleagues.

<HEAD>Hakim Seeking To Bar Lawyer From Testifying Against Him</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arms dealer Albert Hakim is trying to invoke
attorney-client privilege to bar a Geneva-based lawyer from
testifying against him and three co-defendants in the Iran-Contra
case.
   Defense lawyers are seeking a court hearing to determine if any
of the information that lawyer and financial adviser Willard Zucker
gave Iran-Contra prosecutors violated his attorney-client privilege
with Hakim, according to papers ordered unsealed Wednesday by U.S.
District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.
   A U.S. citizen, Zucker operates a Swiss company called Compagnie
de Services Fiduciares SA (CSF) that helped move thousands of
dollars generated by the U.S.-Iran arms sales through offshore
shell companies and bank accounts to prevent the funds from being
traced.
   Zucker, a former Internal Revenue Service attorney, received
immunity from prosecution in return for cooperating with the
investigation of independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, according
to the court papers.
   In the motion ordered unsealed by Gesell, Hakim contends that
his longstanding business relationship with Zucker is protected not
only by attorney-client privilege but by confidentiality imposed on
Zucker by Swiss privacy laws.
   The defense is trying to force Walsh to detail the information
he received from Zucker so defense lawyers can determine if Zucker
breached the privlege.
   The information ``is meant to provide the basis for further
action by the court that may well result in the suppression of any
effort by the government to introduce at any trial either the
testimony of Mr. Zucker or any information derived directly or
indirectly from government contacts with Mr. Zucker.''
   ``Production of such information may lead Mr. Hakim to request
that the court impose sanctions upon the government for
prosecutorial misconduct,'' the defense said.
   While ``Hakim is reluctant to make allegations of improper
behavior'' against prosecutors or Zucker, his lawyers said ``the
sequence of known events, however, raises a spectre of impropriety
that merits full illumination through the court's process.''
   The defense also threatened to try to suppress any testimony by
Zucker at the trial of former National Security Council aide Oliver
L. North, the first defendant scheduled to be tried on the
Iran-Contra conspiracy charges.
   No date has been set for North's trial.
   Hakim is charged with conspiring with his former business
partner, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, North and
former national security adviser John M. Poindexter to illegally
divert proceeds from the arms-for-hostage deals to the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   Additionally, Hakim and Secord are charged with conspiring to
pay illegal gratuities to North, including an offer to create a
fund to finance the college education of the retired Marine
officer's children. Zucker is an unindicted co-conspirator with
Hakim and Secord, according to the court papers.
   The aim of the conspiracy was to ``give things of value'' to
North to encourage him to stay on the National Security Council
staff and help ensure that Hakim and Secord ``would continue to
receive opportunities for substantial revenues and profits in
connection with lucrative activities referred to them by North,''
said the indictment.
   According to the indictment, Zucker traveled to Philadelphia in
March 1986 to discuss the plan with North's wife, Elizabeth.
   Hakim told the congressional committees last year that he
suggested the meeting, relating that Zucker had told Mrs. North an
anonymous admirer of her husband wanted ``to help out with the
university and educational expenses of the children.''
   The congressional committees said they found no evidence the
fund was ever set up, though $15,000 was transferred to an account.
The transmittal order bore Zucker's handwritten notation ``Mrs.
Bellybutton.''
   Hakim's lawyers said that they protested in writing to Walsh and
Zucker after learning late last year that the Geneva-based attorney
was talking to prosecutors. But neither Zucker nor prosecutors
acknowledged such cooperation, the defense said.
   Zucker's cooperation came to light earlier this year in
pre-trial hearings following the indictment.
   ``Mr. Hakim has long utilized the services of Mr. Zucker and CSF
in the conduct of his legal and business affairs,'' defense lawyers
said. ``In so doing, he has often entered into confidential
communications with Mr. Zucker for the purpose of security both
opinions on law and legal services.''
   ``Mr. Hakim has insisted that all communications with respect to
those services remain confidential,'' defense lawyers N. Richard
Janis and Lawrence H. Wechsler said in their pleading.
   The defense claimed that as a Swiss fiduciary, Zucker ``owes
certain duties of loyalty and confidentiality to Mr. Hakim, the
abrogation of which might render him subject to prosecution in
Switzerland.''

<HEAD>Methadone Substitute Discovered for Heroin Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yale University researchers working with the
National Institutes of Health say they are optimistic that a
methadone substitute they discovered will prove more effective in
getting heroin addicts off all drugs.
   If true, it could have a significantly help curb the spread of
AIDS among drug abusers and their sexual partners.
   Thomas R. Kosten and associates at the university's school of
medicine are conducting a six-month study with 120 subjects to see
whether they can duplicate the promising results from a one-month,
pilot study involving 41 addicts.
   ``I think this can be a major treatment advance for us in
working with these drug addicts who are spreading AIDS on the
streets,'' Kosten said Wednesday at a seminar.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus
most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood
products or semen from infected persons.
   It is now spreading faster among intravenous drug abusers than
any other segment of the population because of their tendency to
share needles that have traces of another person's blood on them.
   The president's AIDS commission concluded that curbing
intravenous drug abuse _ and having a federal law barring
discrimination against people with the AIDS virus _ are the two
main keys to fighting the epidemic that threatens to kill a million
or more people already believed to be infected.
   The drug Kosten is working with is buprenorphine, which has been
used in Europe for about 10 years as a prescription pain reliever,
although not in drug treatment programs.
   The pilot study by Kosten and Herbert D. Kleber, financed by the
National Institute on Drug Abuse, found that buprenorphine was as
effective as methadone at blunting the subjects' craving for heroin.
   But unlike heroin or methadone, buprenorphine appears to be
virtually non-addicting and does not pose the risk of overdose,
said Kosten.
   The biggest potential payoff, however, is that the pilot test
subjects did not experience the severe withdrawal symptoms common
to users of heroin and methadone when either drug is stopped.
   ``What we are going for, eventually, is to get people drug free
and that is a problem with methadone,'' said Kosten.
   A longstanding criticism of methadone treatment is that it
essentially switches one addiction for another __ albeit to a legal
one normally administered in a controlled setting.
   But Kosten noted that the ``potential for (methadone) abuse is
not nil.''
   Although methadone is normally dissolved and taken in liquid
form under observation at drug treatment centers, it also sometimes
is illicitly injected as a street substitute for heroin.
   Although it is possible buprenorphine could be injected in
nonclinical settings, it appears to open a new avenue to weaning
addicts from the physical trauma of withdrawal from either heroin
or methadone.
   The idea is to eliminate the withdrawal hurdle, making it easier
for addicts to get off all injectable drugs and eliminate their
continued exposure to AIDS-contaminated needles.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A properly functioning $40 million Navy
Trident test missile was destroyed by mistake last month when a
range safety officer incorrectly concluded it was veering out of
control, according to the chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee.
   ``There's always someone who doesn't get the word and in this
instance it was the man with his finger on the destruct button,''
said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.
   Aspin said that although the missile was following the intended
flight path after its Sept. 19 launch from the Air Force's Eastern
Space and Missile Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., it appeared to
the safety officer that it was about to leave the range safety
corridor.
   Aspin said the missile was ``properly functioning'' and that the
safety officer destroyed it ``through what amounted to a
misunderstanding.''
   Vernon Guidry, a spokesman for the Armed Services Committee,
said the missile was valued at $40 million.
   The incident occurred during the 15th in a series of 19
land-based tests of the missile which is designed to be fired by
the U.S. Trident submarine fleet. Aspin said the Air Force is
working to prevent a recurrence.
   With 15 tests accomplished, the series shows two outright
failures and one only partial success, Aspin said. All other
flights went as planned.
   The destruction of the 15th missile by mistake was counted as a
``no test'' because the missile itself did not malfunction, Aspin
said.
   Aspin said a review of the Trident test program showed that the
13th flight on July 7 was a failure and the missile was destroyed
in flight.
   The cause of this failure is under review, Aspin said.
   The next test on Aug. 20 was a success.
   Aspin said the July 7 launch and other earlier malfunctions had
different causes, now believed to be corrected.
   ``Overall, test results indicate the missile is still meeting
its objectives,'' Aspin said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Says Long N-Reactor Delays Could Hurt US Security</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prolonged delay in restarting nuclear
weapons reactors could jeopardize national security, say Pentagon
officials who expressed relief at an Energy Department announcement
that it planned to resume production of tritium early next year.
   ``Obviously, the sooner the better as far as we are concerned,''
a Pentagon official said Wednesday. ``Tritium is absolutely
essential for the production of warheads'' on modern thermonuclear
weapons, said the official, speaking on condition that his name not
be used.
   ``If (the reactors) are not started for several years, then we
might begin to have trouble,'' said the source. Officials at the
Defense and Energy Departments said that for security reasons they
could not specify the exact amount of tritium that the government
has and needs, or when a shortage would become critical.
   In a related development, Energy Department spokeswoman Gail
Bradshaw said tests showed no health threat to three workers
exposed to radiation at a nuclear weapons facility, the Rocky Flats
plutonium processing plant in Golden, Colo., on Sept. 29. The plant
has been closed by the government for safety reasons.
   Energy Secretary John S. Herrington, seeking to defuse criticism
of lax safety standards at nuclear facilities, announced Tuesday
that one of three tritium-producing reactors at the Energy
Department's Savannah River Plant, in Aiken, S.C., will begin ``a
phased start-up'' in December, culminating in January.
   The three reactors at Savannah River, first brought into
operation in 1954, have been closed down since August for safety
and maintenance checks, and Herrington announced new operating
procedures to reduce the danger of a mishap.
   The Energy Department manufactures nuclear warheads for the
Pentagon, and its Savannah River reactors are the sole source of
plutonium and tritium for bombs.
   Herrington told a congressional panel last Feb. 23 that ``we are
awash in plutonium.''
   A delay of several years in renewing the production of tritium
is possible because of problems at Savannah River. The government
does not plan to start construction of a new generation of nuclear
weapons reactors until the early 1990s for completion around the
turn of the century.
   Due to safety problems, the Savannah River reactors will be
operated only at half power, energy officials say.
   Tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen, is used to increase the
efficiency of nuclear warheads, allowing engineers to produce
smaller and lighter weapons, said Tom Cochran, a physicist and
co-author of ``The Nuclear Weapons Handbook,'' a detailed analysis
of the U.S. arsenal.
   Tritium, however, has a short halflife. Half of any quantity of
tritium will degrade in 12.3 years, meaning that 5.5 percent of the
sample will degrade per year.
   That means the government needs to replenish the tritium modules
on each of its estimated 22,000 warheads to assure that they have
the anticipated explosive power, said Cochran.
   The tritium module on each warhead is replenished every eight to
10 years, said a Pentagon source.
   Tritium is so important for modern thermonuclear weapons that a
group of physicists recently suggested banning its production as a
means of forcing arms cuts by the United States and the Soviet
Union.
   ``Tritium is unique among nuclear weapons materials in its
potential to drive nuclear arms reductions if both sides agreed to
a halt in its production,'' said the proposal, which appeared in
the Sept. 2 edition of Science magazine.
   The proposal was written by J. Carson Mark, former leader of the
theoretical division of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico, and Thomas D. Davies, Milton M. Hoenig and Paul L.
Levanthol.
   Neither the Soviet Union nor United States has accepted the
proposal to cease tritium production. And W.G. Sutcliffe, a
scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, wrote in the
same edition of Science that banning tritium production could
``leave the United States in a vulnerable position'' because it is
not known exactly to what degree the Soviets depend on it.

   Thirty-four 1989-model autos will be slammed
into a barrier at 35 mph to help the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration judge how the occupants would fare in the
event of an actual crash.
   All auto models are crash-tested by their manufacturers to
ensure they comply with federal safety standards, but the results
are held secret by the companies.
   The 35 mph test conducted under the government's public
crash-test program, intended as a guide to consumers, is 5 mph
faster than the speed required for compliance with the safety
standards, the agency said Wednesday.
   The results will be measured by dummies wired with instruments
that show the force on the head, chest and upper legs. The dummies
will be protected by seat belts or air bags.
   Passenger cars to be tested under the public crash-test program
are the Audi 80, Chevrolet Caprice, Chrysler Fifth Avenue, Dodge
Daytona, Dodge Spirit, Eagle Medallion, Eagle Premier, Ford Probe,
Ford Thunderbird, Geo Metro 2-door and 4-door, Honda Civic CRX,
Hyundai Sonata, Lincoln Continental, Mercury Tracer, Mitsubishi
Galant, Mitsubishi Mirage, Nissan 240 SX, Nissan Maxima, Peugeot
505, Plymouth Acclaim, Toyota Corolla, Toyota Cressida and
Volkswagen Fox.
   Pickups, vans and multi-purpose passenger vehicles to be tested
are the Chevrolet Astro, Chevrolet S-10 Blazer, Ford Bronco II,
Isuzu Trooper II, Jeep Cherokee, Mazda van, Mitsubishi van, Suzuki
Sidekick, Toyota pickup and Toyota van.

<HEAD>VA Denies it Fudged Hospital Death Data</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans Administration's chief medical
officer denies a published report that he ordered changes in a
study of death rates at VA hospitals to avoid bad publicity.
   ``That is not only grossly inaccurate but is a totally
outrageous accusation,'' John A. Gronvall said of the report in The
Washington Post on Tuesday.
   Gronvall, the VA's chief medical director, said the results of a
sophisticated statistical analysis ``were and are intact.'' The VA
said the methods in the analysis were praised by the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
   ``The Post accuses me of `directing researchers to produce a
smaller number of questionable hospitals,'' Gronvall said in a
statement issued by the VA. ``I personally initiated this study so
that if we found problems in VA's quality of care we could correct
them.''
   The Post said the initial study had found that as many as 12
percent of VA facilities had excessively high death rates and that
the rate was dropped to just 3.5 percent by using a more rigorous
statistical standard in a revised study.
   The Post said Gronvall acknowledged in an interview that he
ordered VA officials to come up with a lower percentage because he
feared the VA could not withstand the criticism that would follow a
comparison with mortality rates at private hospital.
   Terry L. Thomas, a VA epidemiologist who directed the study, was
quoted by the newspaper as saying she wasn't too happy with it.
   The VA said, however, that she was misquoted.
   ``There was absolutely no pressure applied to me to change
results,'' she is quoted by the VA. ``I never made the remark
attributed to me that I `wasn't too happy' ... or that I saw `too
many red flags.'''

<HEAD>FAA Says Air Traffic Error Possibly Responsible for Close Pass</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials are investigating the
possibility that an air traffic control error led a commuter plane
to fly too close to Air Force One while President Reagan was
traveling from Philadelphia to Newark, N.J.
   White House and Federal Aviation Administration officials
stressed that the president was in no danger during the incident
Wednesday afternoon, with the FAA saying the two planes came no
closer than two miles horizontally and 500 feet vertically.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president was
not aware of the incident until later.
   Fitzwater said the FAA had indicated to White House officials
``that the operational error was related to the air traffic control
system.''
   FAA spokesman Bob Buckhorn said the incident occurred at 2:35
p.m. EDT, northwest of Trenton, N.J.
   ``We're investigating a possible operational error with a Bar
Harbor Airlines aircraft,'' Buckhorn said. ``We are not talking
about a near miss. Preliminary reports indicate there may have been
an operational error.''
   Buckhorn said the error involved a ``separation violation. In
that particular area the separation should have been three miles
and it was allowed to close to two miles.''
   Weinberg said Air Force One pilot Col. Robert Ruddick felt that
no one aboard the presidential plane was endangered.
   Bar Harbor Airlines spokesman Steve Mason said Continental
Express flight 3494, an ATR-42 aircraft, was en route from
Baltimore to Newark with 33 passengers and three crew members
aboard when the incident occurred.
   ``It's our understanding that our airplane was in its normal
flight path when it passed a little over a mile from Air Force One
which was making some sort of change in routing to allow another
aircraft to pass first,'' said Mason. The airline is based in
Bangor, Maine.
   In September 1987, an escort helicopter in Reagan's entourage
headed from New York City to Newark International Airport flew
within 500 feet of a private plane after a communications mixup
kept the copter's pilot from contacting air traffic controllers.
   Earlier this year, an Army private was convicted of lying to
officials investigating an August 1987 incident in which the pilot
entered prohibited airspace and flew too close to a helicopter
carrying Reagan to his ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif.

   Czechoslovakia's new premier,
sworn in a day after the most sweeping leadership changes in 20
years, displayed less enthusiasm than his predecessor for reforms
sweeping the Soviet Union.
   Premier Ladislav Adamec was sworn in Wednesday along with his
Cabinet. He replaces Lubomir Strougal, 64, who resigned Monday
after 18 years as premier and also gave up his seat on the ruling
Communist Party Politburo.
   President Gustav Husak, replaced as party chief in December by
Milos Jakes, administered the oath. Husak had led the party since
1968, when Alexander Dubcek was ousted and his liberal ``Prague
Spring'' cut short.
   ``We must carry out the program of restructuring,'' Adamec said
in an acceptance speech, according to a report by the official news
agency CTK. But he added: ``We have no magic wand with which we
could change things overnight.''
   Adamec's remarks appeared to confirm expectations that he would
not have Strougal's enthusiasm for the ``perestroika,'' or
restructuring being promoted by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in
his country.
   Czechoslovakia has paid lip service to Gorbachev-style reforms
but has not attempted an extensive overhaul of its economy or
social structure. One of Adamec's first jobs will be to work out a
program for submission to the next session of parliament.
   The country has fared well in comparison to Hungary and Poland,
whose large foreign debts and stagnant economies have reduced
living standards, but economic growth has slowed recently.
   Adamec, a 62-year-old former premier of the Czech Republic and
deputy federal premier, often has criticized poor economic
performance. He said Wednesday the government wants to function as
a ``unified economic center'' with firm control over all branches
of the economy.
   Jakes said Tuesday the Politburo membership had been increased
from 12 to 15 ``temporarily'' to aid in ``restructuring ...
ideological work itself.'' He spoke to the closing session of the
two-day Central Committee meeting at which the personnel changes
were made.
   His speech as reported by CTK emphasized the need to strengthen
the ``leading role of the party.'' He said the leadership must
fight ``shortcomings, bureaucracy, inertia and conservatism'' and
cooperate more closely with the Soviet Union.
   Jan Fojtik, the party's new chief ideologist, said personnel
changes were necessary to change the government's style, overcome
inertia and revamp the sluggish national economy.
   Last April, the Cabinet was reduced from 26 members to the
current 20 by combining several ministries.
   Ten members of Adamec's government are new to the federal
Cabinet, including Jaromir Johanes, who replaced veteran Bohuslav
Chnoupek as foreign minister. Johanes had been Chnoupek's deputy
since July 1987 and previously served as ambassador to Canada and
the United States.
   The Czech and Slovak parliaments chose new premiers Wednesday.
Frantisek Pitra replaced Adamec in the Czech republic and Ivan
Knotek was named in Slovakia to succeed Peter Colotka, who resigned
his government and party posts Monday along with Strougal.
   Pitra and Knotek automatically become deputy federal premiers.

   Kenneth Lain's discovery of a hidden $75,300
treasure while following a trail of cockroaches has officials
bugged.
   Tempe officials have been unable to decide who should get the
money and have asked the Superior Court to make the decision.
   Lain, 25, said he found the money June 12 while hunting bugs in
his rented home here.
   ``I was just getting some chores done and I thought, `I'm really
going to get these guys,''' said the account executive for a credit
bureau. ``I decided to spray under the air-conditioning vent
because it looked buggy under there.''
   When Lain stuck a mirror into the air-conditioning vent to check
on what was inside, he saw a white, dusty bag.
   ``I thought it was a bag of toys some children had left, because
it was quite heavy,'' he said.
   It was full of $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills.
   ``You're filled with adrenalin,'' he said of his reaction.
``You're shaking all over.''
   Under Arizona law, Tempe is required to give the money to ``any
person who makes a valid claim'' if the true owner has not claimed
it within 50 days.
   Receipts from a Chicago restaurant were found in the bag, but
that led investigators nowhere. Investigators also contacted
several previous owners and renters of the house, but nobody knew
where the money came from.
   Fifty days went by, but Lain still could not celebrate.
   His landlord filed a claim with Tempe police, saying that
because the money was found on his property, it belonged to him.
   No hearing date has been set in Maricopa County Superior Court.

   Dr. Seuss author Theodore Geisel, who
created such children's best sellers as ``The Cat in The Hat'' and
``Green Eggs and Ham,'' will be getting a creative ``thank you''
from a group of Arvada school children.
   The sixth-graders at Campbell Elementary School are mailing a
book containing Seuss-like characters to the famous author as
thanks for allowing his works to be displayed at Denver's
Children's Museum.
   Six students were selected to create the book because of their
strong writing and illustrating abilities. Among the things they
came up with:
   _The Cusslater, a machine that cleanses the abusive vocabulary
of children who call other children names.
   _The Spitasaurus, which spits on people who spit on their
friends. The Spitasaurus, a rainbow-striped giraffe, gives good
children a ride. But spitters only get a dose of their own bad
behavior.
   _The automatic dresser for teachers, which helps them get ready
more quickly in the morning.
   The monthlong Seuss exhibit here includes more than 300 rough
sketches, paintings, color proofs and posters.

   The source of a 13-year-old prank in stained
glass at the University of Washington has been uncovered: The
architect did it.
   University spokesman Tom Griffin says architect David Wright is
responsible for a portrait of George Washington at the school's
Health Sciences cafeteria that bears the inscription, ``Num Me
Vexo?''
   For non-Latin scholars that means, ``What, Me Worry?'' And, yes,
it was inspired by Alfred E. Neuman, the grinning, big-eared symbol
of Mad magazine.
   Wright was the designer of the south campus center where the
stained glass portrait of Washington hangs.
   Griffin's research answered questions raised by a weekly
newspaper story that called ``Num Me Vexo?'' the strangest Latin
inscription in Seattle. Griffin said the inscription came about
because students, who paid for the building in the 1970s, wanted a
picture of a revolutionary there.
   Washington was selected and ``Num Me Vexo?'' was Wright's
contribution. He asked a friend for the Latin translation and had
artist Michael Kennedy add it to the portrait, Griffin said.
   Wright said Wednesday that no questions were raised at the time
of installation, although a university official did ask him about
the window's significance about six months later.
   Wright said he got rid of the official by explaining the
portrait was taken from a $1 bill, while the Latin inscription was
meant to convey confidence in the currency.
   Wright also said he was pleased his joke was finally discovered.

   Few know precisely what was said when the
great communicator sat down with the green candidate.
   But one can imagine what happened when President Reagan sat down
to talk privately with embattled vice presidential candidate Dan
Quayle.
   To hear White House chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein tell it,
the president did most of the talking and the senator, running
nationwide for the first time, did most of the listening.
   Duberstein said Quayle had sought out Reagan to get a few tips.
He said the president obliged with delight, inviting the senator to
the White House on the Saturday before his debate with Democrat
Lloyd Bentsen.
   ``I don't think it's so much that he's (Reagan) a mentor, but
Sen. Quayle wanted to talk to the president who had done so well in
debates _ the great communicator _ to get his advice on techniques,
camera angles,'' he said.
   ``They talked generally about what the president had done in his
debates, more so than what Sen. Quayle should do, but what worked
for Reagan,'' Duberstein said, declining to elaborate.
   When Quayle gave a less than dazzling performance last week, few
in public life were more in a position than Reagan to spring to his
defense. The president can look back to the political firestorm he
created in his initial 1984 debate with Democrat Walter F. Mondale
by giving erratic and stumbling answers to several questions.
   Reagan has been dropping Quayle's name incessantly since the
Omaha, Neb., debate. Before that, the president had barely alluded
to the young Indiana senator since he lauded Vice President George
Bush's choice during a campaign rally on Aug. 24 in Los Angeles, a
week after Quayle was selected.
   White House officials sought to minimize notions that Reagan
began speaking out more fiercely for Quayle only after the Omaha
debate. But the presidential speech record and Reagan's own
off-the-cuff remarks show otherwise.
   Reagan, for instance, was quick to assail as ``a cheap shot''
Bentsen's putdown of Quayle's statement comparing himself with John
F. Kennedy.
   When Quayle boasted Wednesday that ``I am my own campaign
handler,'' and said he was breaking away from Bush campaign
managers, Reagan noted that ``very often in a campaign, there's got
to be debate about what's the right thing to do.''
   A similar break occurred after Reagan's spotty performance four
years ago.
   Both Reagan and Quayle emerged from their initial debate tests
with supporters complaining that they had been over-programmed by
their campaign handlers. Reagan broke away from his handlers four
years ago _ as Quayle says he has done now.
   ``What have you done to Ronnie?'' The Washington Post quoted
Nancy Reagan as saying to White House aides when the president left
the Louisville, Ky., stage. Reagan's close friend and confidant,
Paul Laxalt, said that the next time around, ``we will let Reagan
be Reagan.''
   That 1984 faceoff also had stirred up the ``age issue'' _ the
flip side of an issue that has dogged Quayle.
   In Reagan's case, the question was whether the president was too
old for another term, rather than whether he was mature enough to
shoulder this responsibility.
   Quayle's youth seems to intrigue Reagan, who so often has spoken
to audiences of young people as he stumps for Bush and Quayle.
Perhaps he sees Quayle as the ultimate heir to the Reagan
revolution.
   ``Reagan seems to be fascinated'' with Quayle, said Democratic
campaign consultant Robert Keefe. ``He's (Reagan) just a pleasant,
not-too-serious kind of guy. And that description also fits Quayle.
I can see that he and Reagan would get along well.''
   As for Quayle's fondness for Reagan, Keefe said, ``Remember that
he came in to the Senate on Reagan's coattails in the president's
landslide election in Indiana in 1980.''

   Leaders of black organizations are kicking off
a coast-to-coast tour in an effort to boost the minority vote and
halt Reagan administration policies that they believe have hurt
blacks.
   Minorities can have an effect on the presidential and
congressional elections Nov. 8 ``if our people recognize our stake
in protecting ourselves from the train that is coming down the
track,'' Walter Fauntroy, a Democrat who is the non-voting delegate
from the District of Columbia, said at a news conference Wednesday.
   The campaign is expected to center on at least 15 states and 44
cities, he said, adding that the aim is to convince blacks to
``vote now as never before.''
   Although many of the black leaders' activities will be
non-partisan, the group has received $50,000 from the Democratic
National Committee and includes members from former Democratic
presidential candidate Jesse Jackson's National Rainbow Coalition,
said Fauntroy, who heads the National Black Leadership Roundtable.
   If black voters cannot get excited about voting for Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis, ``let's get angry about what policies have
been implemented'' by the Reagan administration in the past eight
years, Fauntroy said.
   Blacks must vote ``if for no other reason than to slam the door
on eight years of Reagan-Bush policies that would be continued by a
Bush-Quayle-Reagan administration,'' Fauntroy said.
   Martin Luther King III said church leaders would be involved in
local efforts to back up the black leaders' tour, which is expected
to begin Friday in Baltimore and end Nov. 7 in San Diego, Calif.
   Black leaders are being asked to join the tour that also is to
stop in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Michigan, Ohio,
Illinois, Tennessee, Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama,
Louisiana and Texas. Other states could be added later.
   Comedian and political activist Dick Gregory said his message to
black voters would be simply ``You don't got no choice'' but to
vote.

<TEXT>
   Dan Quayle's public break with some of
his handlers in the George Bush camp may be more a matter of style
than substance, but the Republican vice presidential candidate
clearly is exhibiting some independence these days on the campaign
trail.
   The Indiana senator declared Wednesday that he was fed up with
the rigid control and anonymous sniping from Bush aides and is now
``my own handler.''
   ``It was a very controlled environment. I don't operate very
well in a controlled environment,'' Quayle told reporters on his
campaign plane en route here.
   But whether there'll be any real changes in his campaign or
whether _ as the Democrats are suggesting _ this new tack is the
ultimate in handling by master strategist James A. Baker III, is
not yet clear.
   As Quayle travels to Oklahoma and Arkansas today, his campaign
is being watched closely to see what if any changes the candidate
has to offer.
   Quayle has been much more relaxed and accessible to the press
this week than at any previous time in his campaign, chatting with
reporters on his plane and allowing himself to be questioned on an
impromptu basis at campaign stops. But he still has not had a
formal news conference in more than a month.
   On Wednesday, Quayle even started shouting back at hecklers in
Rapid City, S.D., calling them ``SDI naysayers'' when they objected
to his support for the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   On his plane, Quayle cited his SDI comments as an example of his
new ``controlled spontaneity.''
   And he kept up his good-natured jabs at the press, waving a
lethal-looking pick ax he was given at the rally and saying, ``I've
got a few targets for this. Where's the media when I'm looking for
them?''
   Such freewheeling gestures would not have been seen on this
campaign in the past. But they do not necessarily mean true
independence.
   His schedule is still determined by Bush strategists, and even
Quayle said he would continue to read the speeches prepared for
him. Those are cleared, at least in early draft form, by the Bush
campaign.
   His aides, many of them Baker intimates, are openly delighted
that Quayle's declaration of independence has become news.
   They reject the suggestion from Michael Dukakis' camp that the
new Dan Quayle is yet another Baker ploy to prop up a weak
candidate.
   ``Coming from the campaign that has used every ploy in the book
to prop up their own weak candidate at the top of the ticket, they
should know,'' said Quayle's spokesman, David Prosperi.
   Quayle seems delighted at the new turn of events.
   ``I'm going to have fun, and I'm going to say what's on my
mind,'' he said.
   He said he was ``not mad at anybody in the Bush campaign,'' but
he has previously expressed irritation at published reports quoting
unidentified Bush aides as calling him a liability for the ticket.
Over the weekend, he complained to Baker about the sniping.
   Quayle told reporters he will still coordinate with Bush
officials and ``stay in close communication with them.''
   ``They're going to suggest things that I say, suggest things
that I do, and I'm going to take that under consideration,'' he
said.
   ``I've done it their way this far and now it's my turn,'' he
added.
   He stressed that he had cordial relations with Baker, the
campaign chairman. The two men spoke at length on Tuesday night.
Baker said he understands ``why he (Quayle) would be steamed'' over
the sniping by Bush aides.
   Baker also said that anyone caught criticizing Quayle will be
fired.
   ``If I could find out who was putting them out, we'd have fewer
people working in the campaign,'' the Bush campaign chairman said.
``We're going to make a little effort'' to find out who on the
staff provided those anonymous criticisms to the news media.
   Quayle's unhappiness with the sniping came to a head last
Friday, two days after the debate, when anonymous Bush aides were
quoted as saying he had not done well in the debate with Democrat
Lloyd Bentsen and was a liability to the ticket.
   ``I think there is a snapping point that everyone goes through
and it snapped about Friday sometime, last Friday,'' Quayle said.

   President Reagan is urging those
Democratic voters who put him in the White House to vote again for
the Republican candidate and even consider joining the ranks of the
Grand Old Party.
   Reagan campaigned at a $20-a-plate, Italian-American dinner on
Wednesday, pitching the cause of George Bush and Dan Quayle to
several thousand voters, in an area where many Democrats crossed
party lines to vote for the GOP candidate in 1980 and 1984.
   The president, munching on pasta and salad, beamed amid the rows
and rows of diners as dozens stood to snap his picture and one man
leaped to his feet and boomed out, ``President Reagan, We love
you.''
   The president, never one to shy away from a good audience,
confided in his speech that he wanted ``to tell you something I
have never said before. You know I am a former Democrat.''
   The president loves to regale his fans _ particularly those he
hopes to snare for Bush _ with his own conversion from a follower
of Franklin D. Roosevelt to leader of the nation's conservative
forces.
   ``And it is often said that the once-proud Democratic party of
F.D.R. and Harry Truman is dead and gone _ that the Democratic
Party has been taken over by the left. ... But there is something
you should know _ the party of F.D.R. and Harry Truman couldn't be
killed,'' Reagan said.
   The president argued that ``the party that represents people
like you and me, that represents the majority of Americans, this
party hasn't disappeared _ the fact is we are stronger than ever.''
   ``You see, the secret is, that when the left took over the
Democratic Party, we took over the Republican Party,'' Reagan said,
evoking a round of hearty cheers and lengthy applause from his
audience.
   Reagan boasted that due to this revolution, the Republican Party
has become ``the party of working people, the family, the
neighborhood, the defense of freedom, and, yes, the American flag
and the Pledge of Allegiance to `one nation under God.'''
   ``The party that so many of us grew up with still exists, except
today it's called the Republican Party, and I'm asking all of you
to come home and join me,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan's trip took him to two hotly contested Northeastern
states _ Pennsylvania and New Jersey _ where Bush and Democrat
Michael Dukakis are slugging it out for a combined total of 41
electoral votes.
   After urging a group of high school students to help get out the
vote for Nov. 8 in suburban Philadelphia earlier in the day, Reagan
attended a Republican fund-raising reception and had lunch with
Archbishop Anthony J. Bevilacqua of Philadelphia.
   He then flew to New Jersey for another fund-raiser in Newark
before attending the Italian-American event in West Orange.
   Asked at one point how important the Bush-Dukakis debate tonight
will be, the president replied: ``I think we have to wait and see
the debate. I know who the winner is already.''
   Federal Aviation Administration officials said that as Reagan
was en route to New Jersey, Air Force One and a commuter plane may
have flown too close to one another, but the president was in no
danger.
   The president's plane and a Bar Harbour Airlines plane came no
closer than two miles horizontally and 500 feet vertically, but
should have been three miles apart, said FAA spokesman Bob
Buckhorn. The FAA is investigating the incident, he said.

<HEAD>Islam Information Ministers Want Different World View of Moslems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Information ministers from 43
Islamic lands met for two days at this Red Sea port with the
objective of removing barriers to the non-Moslem world and of
improving the exchange of news among themselves.
   The director general of the Islamic Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, Professor Abdelhadi Boutaleb, told the
ministers that the world's estimated 800 million Moslems must be
educated against outside influences that included ``foreign media''
characterizations of ``backwardness, ignorance and fanaticism as
the main features of our peoples.''
   However, the communique issued at the end of the conference _
attended by representatives from all the nations within the Islamic
Conference Organization except Iran and the Maldives _ barely noted
concern over anti-Moslem sentiment.
   It endorsed instead known Moslem views on Palestinian
self-determination, Lebanon, Afghanistan, South African apartheid,
an Iran-Iraq peace accord and other issues.
   The communique, without mentioning Iran by name, singled out
that country for harsh criticism for activities detrimental to
Islam's image.
   It said the meeting ``expressed its opposition to extremism and
violence which have projected Islam as though it were a religion of
bloodshed, war, dissension and violation of mosques and other
peaceful places of worship.''
   The reference in part appeard to be to the riots last year
involving Iranian pilgrims to Mecca in which more than 400 people
died.
   Sharifuddin Pir Zadeh, the Pakistani secretary-general of the
Organization of Islamic Conference, complained at a closed session
on Tuesday that reports from Western news agencies ``ignore or
deliberately distort'' Islamic issues.
   Saudi Arabia does not as a rule grant entry to foreign
journalists. Western news agencies appeared to be the only outside
media allowed to cover the conference, except for a U.S. television
crew from Cairo.

   The lecterns, stage and backdrop were
familiar fixtures for George Bush and Michael Dukakis as they made
their separate ways today around Pauley Pavilion, the UCLA
basketball arena quickly turned into a forum for a presidential
contest.
   The two candidates were each visiting the hall today for about
90 minutes _ the length of tonight's second and final presidential
debate _ to get acquainted with the surroundings and the doubly
backed-up sound systems.
   Moderator Bernard Shaw and the three panelists, whose
microphones had only one backup, were also holding a practice
session of their own and were counting on having time enough to
fire off at least 22 questions.
   To make sure that the television lighting was uninterrupted
along with the sound, organizers of the event made sure that every
fixture aiming a TV spotlight had a backup light, said Ed Fouhy,
executive producer of the bipartisan Commission on Presidential
Debates.
   Fouhy said Wednesday that preparations had gone fairly smoothly
since UCLA was selected last Friday for the debate site because it
was ``a big time university with a big time staff.''
   The 34,000-student university is accustomed to mega-events,
having hosted gymnastic competition for the 1984 Olympics as well
as serving as the Olympic village to house the athletes. Last
year's visit by Britain's visiting Prince Andrew and the Duchess of
York was another exercise in tight security and logistics.
   The sprawling, palm tree-dotted University of California campus
was chosen after the League of Women Voters withdrew as debate
sponsor in a dispute with the Bush and Dukakis campaigns. The
league had planned to hold the debate in the old Shrine Auditorium.
   The debates commission, established by both campaigns to handle
the first presidential debate in Winston-Salem, N.C., on Sept. 25,
and the vice presidential debate last week, was asked to sponsor
the Los Angeles event.
   With the commission sponsorship came the red-carpeted stage, the
deep blue backdrop and oak lecterns that were inaugurated in
Winston-Salem. The fixtures were trucked in straight from Omaha,
Neb., where they were used for the debate between Lloyd Bentsen and
Dan Quayle.
   On Wednesdady, the Los Angeles City Council voted 11-2 to give
$25,000 to help fund the debate. Among those dissenting was
Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who said ``I would have supported it if
it was open to the public.''
   As it stands, the audience of 1,500 people in the 12,000-seat
arena will consist of selected Republicans and Democrats as the
debate is played out for the more important television viewers.
   The basketball court was carpeted in blue and partitioned off to
create a cozier atmosphere and better TV look.

<HEAD>Government Asks Unity After Right-Wing Groups Bolt From Pinochet
Fold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chile's interior minister went on
television calling for unity among right-wing backers of a failed
referendum on President Augusto Pinochet who want another candidate
in next year's election.
   ``We repeat our call on those who supported the government in
the referendum to remain united because that is the basis of our
strength, which will be decisive for the future of our nation,''
Interior Minister Sergio Fernandez said Wednesday.
   He insisted the government has no plans to negotiate with the
opposition, which is proposing to change the constitutional
timetable to allow an earlier open presidential election and
Pinochet's departure from power.
   National Renewal, the largest right-wing party, said Tuesday
night a Pinochet candidacy in the open election scheduled for next
year ``has no chances whatsoever of success.''
   The Independent Democratic Union, a far-right party that was
among Pinochet's staunchest supporters in last week's plebiscite,
also dismissed a possible candidacy for the 72-year-old president
and army commander.
   On Oct. 5, Chileans were asked to vote ``yes'' if they supported
Pinochet remaining in power until 1997, and ``no'' if they favored
open elections on Dec. 14, 1989. The general took power in a bloody
1973 coup that deposed an elected leftist government.
   Last week's plebiscite resulted in 3.9 million votes for the
opposition and 3.1 million for Pinochet.
   Legal experts disagree on whether the 1980 Constitution allows
Pinochet to be a candidate. They contend that presidents cannot
succeed themselves.
   The general, who remains secluded at an army retreat near
Santiago, has not commented on the issue. But he also has not
discouraged nationalist groups and military and government officers
who have suggested he should run.
   Those supporting a Pinochet candidacy point at the strong
personal support he received from voters in the referendum.
   Pinochet's wife, Lucia, was quoted by a pro-government newspaper
as urging her husband's supporters to form a ``movement so that the
president will change the Constitution and can be re-elected.''
   Defense Minister Adm. Patricio Carvajal said Pinochet could
easily become a candidate if he resigned shortly before the
election in favor of an interim president.
   Pinochet is to remain in power until March 11, 1990, when the
winner of the open election takes office.
   But opposition leaders, strengthened by their victory in the
referendum, want the Constitution changed to move up the election
and Pinochet's departure.

<HEAD>Two New Political Parties Form</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two more political parties have registered
with the government, but diplomats say pro-democracy forces now may
be too splintered to defeat the ruling party in national elections.
   State-run Radio Rangoon said Wednesday that the Union Karen
League and the United Peace Democracy Party registered with the
election commission, bringing the number of new parties to 14.
   The Union Karen League is the first party representing an ethnic
minority.
   The Karen, one of a dozen major ethnic minority groups among
Burma's 38 million people, number about 2 million. Karen guerrillas
have been fighting the central government for more than four
decades.
   Upon seizing power Sept. 18, a military government under
hard-liner Gen. Saw Maung suppressed anti-government demonstrations
but declared it would allow the formation of political parties and
general elections in about three months.
   Western diplomats in Rangoon say the sudden emergence of small,
weak opposition parties rather than one united group may spell
defeat for pro-democracy forces.
   The opposition groups will face the National Unity Party, which
under a different name has ruled for 26 years. Saw Maung's
government says the party is no longer synomymous with the state
and arrangements are reportedly being made to transfer state-owned
buildings, funds and vehicles once held by the party back to the
government.
   Western diplomats and some opposition leaders say they doubt
free and fair elections can be held under current circumstances. By
the government's own admission, about 450 people have been killed
since Sept. 18 in Saw Maung's drive to quell demonstrations.
   The nationwide uprising against the repressive government began
in late July and involved massive street protests, a general strike
and a bloody backlash in which army troops killed hundreds.
   While Rangoon has remained relatively calm in recent days,
thousands of students have fled to the Thai-Burmese border, seeking
refuge and military training from the Karen and other ethnic
minorities up in arms against the Rangoon government.
   The minorities have been fighting for greater autonomy from the
central government and have announced their support for the
pro-democracy side.
   Rebel officials say about 9,000 students and others have joined
their side and some are being given basic guerrilla training at
bases along the frontier.
   Karen leader Gen. Bo Mya has said his insurgent group, the Karen
National Union, has 17,000 troops.

<HEAD>Government Considers Filing Charges Against Ex-Mayor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Authorities say they are
investigating the former mayor of Port-au-Prince for allegedly
masterminding the massacre of worshipers during a Sept. 11 church
service.
   The slaughter at the St. Jean Bosco Roman Catholic Church came
shortly before a coup by rank-and-file soldiers against the
government of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who was forced into exile.
   Franck Romain, the mayor of this capital city, sought refuge in
the Dominican Embassy during the purge.
   Coup leaders said they were revolted by the massacre and accused
Romain and Namphy of engineering it. St. Jean Bosco's pastor was a
frequent critic of the Namphy government.
   Hospital officials say at least 12 parishoners were killed and
70 wounded when thugs armed with knives and guns randomly shot and
stabbed parishioners. The government and radio stations have put
the number of dead at 13.
   Yves Barbot, second-in-command at the Ministry of Justice, said
Wednesday that the government had ``initiated penal action against
Franck Romain and his accomplices.'' But he said it was premature
to say whether Romain would be tried.
   Barbot said the magistrate handling the case had three months to
decide to indict Romain.
   Romain was elected mayor in fraud-ridden elections run by Namphy
on Jan. 17. During the 29-year Duvalier family dictatorship, Romain
served as police chief and army colonel.
   Prosecutor Jacaman Charles said in an interview with the Voice
of America, broadcast in Haiti Tuesday, that Romain would soon be
summoned to appear in court, but he did not say when.
   President Joaquin Balaguer of the Dominican Republic said
earlier this month that the Haitian government has refused to issue
an exit visa to Romain.
   Arnold Antonin, head of the National Network for the Defense of
Human Rights, said Wednesday that indictment of Romain would be the
first step toward demanding his extradition from the Dominican
Embassy. Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the Caribbean
island of Hispaniola.

<HEAD>Brazilian Leader Pledges to Stop Amazon Destruction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Brazilian officials, vowing not to be
pressured by economic interests, have promised to stem the
widespread burning of Amazon jungle that already has destroyed an
area larger than California.
   President Jose Sarney has unveiled a plan aimed mainly at
stopping uncontrolled forest burning by farmers and ranchers.
   ``We must create nationwide consciousness that we are all
passengers in the adventure of Man on Earth,'' Sarney said
Wednesday in a ceremony announcing the program. ``The era of
unlimited natural resources is over.''
   The program, called ``Our Nature,'' calls for a temporary end to
government tax and financing benefits for large-scale cattle
ranching in the northern Amazon and a ban on exports of unprocessed
tropical timber.
   Environmentalists have charged that the clearing of vast Amazon
tracts by the primitive slash-and-burn method has released hundreds
of tons of noxious gases into the atmosphere.
   They say this is contributing to the greenhouse effect, the
gradual warming of the Earth's atmosphere by a concentration of
pollutants that act like a blanket, trapping the sun's warmth.
   Brazil's government-run Space Research Institute said about
77,000 square miles of land were cleared by the slash-and-burn
method in 1987 and forecast a similar amount for this year.
   The program also includes a recommendation to Brazil's Congress
to cut mercury imports. Free-lance gold prospectors throughout the
Amazon use the highly toxic element to separate gold from river
silt and then throw the waste into the water.
   ``This program is going to shake up powerful economic
interests,'' said Antonio Jose Guimaraes, president of Brazil's
federal Forest Service. ``But the government is resolved to carry
it out.''
   Earlier laws designed to colonize and develop the impoverished
Amazon Basin, which covers an area equal to roughly two-thirds of
the continental United States, permitted land developers to burn
off 50 percent of their properties _ the fastest and cheapest way
to clear land _ and then gave them tax deductions for doing so.
   The World Bank has estimated that since 1978 this type of
land-clearing in the Brazilan Amazon has destroyed 240,000 square
miles of natural tropical rainforest cover, an area larger than
California.
   Interior Minister Joao Alves said the tax break suspensions were
temporary, because the government is working out a plan to
determine which parts of the Amazon can be used for farming and
ranching and which must be left alone.
   Private developers complained about the plan even before it was
announced.
   Orlando Mariutti, who has three projects on a total of 136,000
acres in the western state of Mato Grosso, told the newspaper Folha
de S. Paulo that ``Cutting tax incentives will hold back
development of the Amazon.''
   Large developers in the region, he said, ``generally preserve
more than the 50 percent of the land required by law.''

<HEAD>Congress Completes Action on Medical Waste Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House completed congressional action on
legislation to control the kind of infectious medical waste that
fouled Atlantic Coast beaches this summer.
   The bill, sent to the White House by a voice vote Wednesday,
would require the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a
system for tracking such waste from its creation in medical
facilities to its final disposal.
   Initially, the system would apply only to 10 states:
Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and the Great Lakes
states of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin and
Minnesota.
   The program, however, could become national in scope because any
other state could decide to have its medical waste covered by the
plan and gain authority to act against incoming waste not meeting
the tracking requirements.
   The Senate approved the measure last Friday after making several
minor changes to an earlier House version.
   Congress acted after waves of used syringes, vials of
AIDS-infected blood and other hospital waste that washed up on
beaches along the East Coast, Lake Michigan and Lake Erie during
the summer. The waste became a health problem, closing some beaches
because of the threat of hepatitis and other diseases.
   Under terms of the bill, the EPA would have to set up a system
to track dangerous waste from hospitals, labs and clinics to its
disposal.
   Included in the paper-trail tracking system would be blood,
hypodermic needles, scalpels and surgical and laboratory waste that
had been in contact with infectious agents. They would have to be
segregated from other medical waste and tracked to make sure they
reached a proper disposal facility.
   Lawmakers had accused the EPA of failing to use its regulatory
authority to resolve the problem.
   In 1978, the EPA announced plans to regulate medical waste, but
six years later said it lacked evidence those wastes were causing
enough harm to justify regulations.
   Instead, the EPA released a package of advice to hospitals on
handling and disposal. Since then, the agency has formed a task
force to re-examine the issue.

   Walter Mondale says he may have been
qualified to be president of the country, but couldn't see himself
as president of the University of Minnesota.
   ``I've told the selection committee that I will not be a
candidate,'' the former vice president said Wednesday. ``You know,
I love our university, what it's meant to me and to so many of us
... but I just could not persuade myself that this was the best
role I could play. It's a different world, you know, administering
an academic community, and it just didn't seem the right thing for
me to do.''
   Gov. Rudy Perpich had promoted Mondale as the successor to
Kenneth Keller, who resigned as university president in March. The
governor said persuading lawmakers to approve his budget requests
for the university would have been easier with Mondale at the helm.
   Mondale, who returned to Minnesota to practice law after his
unsuccessful 1984 Democratic presidential bid, said he has no plans
to run for political office in the future.

   Geraldo Rivera and the Tribune Co., which

California father who contends he was wrongly accused of child
sexual abuse on the program.
   Brian Otter accused Rivera and the Chicago-based Tribune Co. of
aiding and abetting Otter's ex-wife, April Curtis, in concealing
the whereabouts of their daughter and subjecting him to severe
emotional distress.
   Otter's attorneys, Jeffrey Leving and Elliot Zinger, filed a
lawsuit Monday in San Bernadino County Superior Court, the
California county in which the father lives, Leving said Tuesday.
   Tribune Co. spokeswoman Martha Lindeman and Rivera spokeswoman
Lynn Lazaroff declined to comment Wednesday on the lawsuit, saying
they hadn't received a copy of it.
   The lawsuit states that Otter has been cleared by San Bernardino
courts of his ex-wife's allegation that he sexually abused their
daughter, Leving said.
   Leving said Ms. Curtis and her daughter appeared on the
``Geraldo'' show broadcast July 18, during which Ms. Curtis
repeated her allegations.

   Three alleged South African agents have
pleaded innocent to charges of murder, terrorism and sabotage in
connection with a car bomb attack on African National Congress
officials.
   The three Zimbabwean nationals _ two whites and a black _ on
Wednesday denied involvement in the Jan. 11 car bombing outside a
house in Bulawayo, administrative capital of western Matabeleland
province and Zimbabwe's second-largest city.
   The explosion killed the man driving the car and seriously
injured an unnamed ANC official inside the house. The ANC is the
main guerrilla organization fighting the white-minority government
in neighboring South Africa.
   Paramilitary police armed with automatic weapons patrolled the
High Court building in downtown Harare as the defendants _ Kevin
Woods, 36, Michael Smith, 34, and Philip Conjwayo, 54 _ were
brought to the hearing in a convoy of armored cars escorted by
troops with submachine guns.
   Acting Attorney-General Andrew Chigovera told Judge President
Wilson Sandura an unemployed man hired to drive the booby-trapped
Renault 5 car died in the blast and one unnamed ANC official among
six occupants of the house in the Bulawayo suburb of Trenance was
seriously injured.
   Chigovera said Woods resigned as a member of Zimbabwe's Central
Intelligence Organiztion security police in 1986, three years after
South African security services recruited him to gather information
on South African refugees living in Zimbabwe.
   Smith is a former soldier in the Rhodesian Light Infantry and
Conjwayo was a onetime agent of the Rhodesian Special Branch.
   The prosecutor said the state will provide evidence Conjwayo
hired Obert Mwanza at a Bulawayo employment agency to drive a
Renault 5 saloon car wired with explosives to the suburban house.
The explosives were allegedly detonated by Smith in a nearby car
using a remote control device, killing Mwanza.
   The three defendants were arrested Jan. 15.
   The state named 16 witnesses it will call in the first major
trial against alleged South African agents since white-ruled
Rhodesia became black-governed Zimbabwe April 18, 1980.
   The uprecedented security cordon at the courthouse follows an
attempt June 30 by alleged South African commandos to free the
Zimbabweans on their way to a remand hearing from Chikurubi Maximum
security prison near the capital Harare.
   A stolen Zimbabwe airforce helicopter was used in the abortive
rescue bid.

<HEAD>General Close To President Garcia Resigns; Reports Say He Warned
Of Coup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading army general who backs President
Alan Garcia has resigned from his post, and reports said he was
forced out after warning of a possible coup.
   A one-day national strike to protest the economic policy was
planned today by the Communist-run General Confederation of
Peruvian Workers, the nation's most powerful labor organization.
   Violence surged on the eve of the strike. A student was shot and
killed at a campus protest and suspected leftist guerrillas burned
a city bus.
   The joint military command on Wednesday confirmed the
resignation of Gen. Victor Raul Silva, commander of army operations
at Peru's disputed border with Ecuador, but did not comment further.
   An army general, speaking on condition his name not be used,
told The Associated Press that Silva was made to resign because he
warned support for a coup was growing within military circles. The
general denied a coup was being planned and said Silva's charges
brought dishonor to the armed forces.
   La Republica, a Lima daily linked to Peru's moderate left,
charged Wednesday in an unattributed report that Silva's discussion
of a coup forced the military to abort a takeover Saturday.
   Silva served for two years as military aide to Garcia, who began
a five-year term in July 1985.
   A growing economic crisis in Peru has produced widespread rumors
of a pending military takeover, but both government and military
spokesmen have publicly dismissed those rumors.
   The powerful military has toppled three democratically elected
governments since 1948. It last ruled from 1968 to 1980.
   Harsh austerity measures imposed by the center-left Garcia
government in early September to slow inflation, growing at a
record annual rate of nearly 1,000 percent, have led to protests.
   Police said an anthropology student was shot in the head at San
Marcos University in Lima during a clash Wednesday between riot
police and about 150 students protesting the austerity measures.
   The police denied charges by University Rector Jorge Campos Rey
that officers fired the bullet, saying instead that the gunshots
came from inside the campus grounds.
   About 35 students were arrested in the clash, police said.
   In the other incident, four hooded young men armed with
submachine guns and revolvers burned a bus after ordering its
driver and 35 passengers off, police said.
   Passengers said the assailants identified themselves as members
of the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group, and warned they
would step up violence Thursday in support of the strike.
   The incident occurred on the Pan American Highway on Lima's
northern outskirts.

   Hundreds of people, some clutching
rosaries, have been visiting a woman who says the cross-shaped
marks that suddenly appeared on her body were drawn by the Virgin
Mary.
   Lina Karabashi, 18, said Wednesday she fasted for three days at
Mary's request because she ``promised me she will give me communion
today.''
   The Iraqi woman said the Virgin Mary drew three crosses on her
body Saturday as she rested at Hussein Medical City, where she
underwent foot surgery Oct. 2. She has had 19 operations since her
left foot was crushed in an accident when she was 6.
   Scores of people visited Mrs. Karabashi in her hospital room.
Her Jordanian husband, Samir, said hundreds more have come to their
home since her release Tuesday. Some brought rosary beads for her
to bless.
   Mrs. Karabashi said the Virgin Mary has visited her 10 times
since Saturday and has has had ``long'' conversations with her.
   ``This is really amazing, terrifying,'' said Elham Azar, who
visited her Wednesday at the stone-built house in the city's Jebel
Webdeh neighborhood.
   Miss Azar, 30, said the crosses ``look real to me ... I am sure
it is a miracle.''
   Roman Catholic church officials in Amman were more cautious.
   ``We cannot yet determine if this phenomenon is sacred,''
pending further investigation, said a church official who insisted
on anonymity.
   An Associated Press reporter who visited Mrs. Karabashi in the
hospital on Sunday saw reddish crosses on the left side of her
neck, left arm and upper chest. The biggest, on her chest, measured
6 inches by 6 inches and the others 2 inches by 2 inches.
   On Wednesday, the two left side crosses had disappeared, while
new ones had appeared on the right side of her neck and right arm.
   The crosses darkened and faded in color as visitors watched.
   A doctor who had treated the woman but refused to give his name
said the crosses ``were not external or caused by any scratches.''
He declined to say what could have made the crosses appear.
   Church officials have said that if medical examinations cannot
provide a scientific explanation, ``then a specialized team from
the Vatican would examine the case.''
   Mrs. Karabashi said she had a similar experience when she was 7
_ a light appeared from a portrait of the Virgin Mary as she was
praying, but she said the light faded when she went to touch it.

   The 100th Congress, the reluctant Congress,
isn't quite ready to go home.
   Despite growing election pressures to get home and campaign,
Congress may have to remain in town into next week to deal with the
year's hottest campaign topic _ drug abuse and the war against it.
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., delivered the bad news
to anxious-to-campaign colleagues Wednesday night. ``It is doubtful
the drug bill will be ready to be voted on before next Tuesday or
Wednesday,'' he told groaning House members at a night session.
   Over in the Senate, Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.,
tried late Wednesday night to get agreement on how to proceed with
the bill. His plan wasn't even out of his mouth before Sen. William
Armstrong, R-Colo., interrupted to say he would be ``dumbfounded''
if Byrd could get everyone to agree to any single plan of attack.
   Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas warned that at the rate the
Senate was moving, ``we're going to need a week and half more on
the drug bill. ''
   ``I'm not running this year. I'll be right here,'' Dole added.
   ``The best thing we can do for the country is to shut the
Congress down and go home and make the people safe until next
January,'' said Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah.
   Even if the Senate passes the massive bill by Friday, Foley said
it would take days to iron out differences between the Senate and
House versions. That would propel the Congress into the third week
of October.
   Election Day for all 435 House seats, and 33 Senate seats, will
be only three weeks away next Tuesday. Members of the House and
Senate had hoped to be back home by early October, or this coming
weekend at the latest.
   Instead, with the weekend approaching, the Senate spent much of
the day in repeated recesses and time-eating quorum calls. That
left the Senate floor free for senators to come in and talk about
issues dear to their hearts, their states or both.
   In fact, Congress could have gone home at midnight Friday, Sept.
30, the end of fiscal 1988. At that time, it finished work on the
13 appropriation bills needed to keep the government operating
through fiscal 1989. No must-pass legislation remained.
   But the session resumed the following week, working on what
members refer to as ``cats and dogs,'' non-pressing bills of
particular interest to individual members. This week, the Senate
passed a tax bill, but even that faces a tough battle in
negotiations with the House.
   Looking at the 100-odd amendments to the drug bill, Byrd told
his colleagues he understood the ``proclivity on the part of
senators to try to load everything onto these last-minute trains
that are leaving the station.''
   ``I hope we will not let this debate on the drug bill
deteriorate into a political sideshow where we will all be taking
political potshots, where we will be trying to indicate who can be
the toughest, and who can be the John Wayne of the drug war,'' Byrd
said.
   He urged fellow senators to try to limit amendments, ``then, say
no more amendments, just debate this bill, and go home.''
   Across the Capitol, Foley told reporters, ``We are watching with
interest what the Senate is doing.''

<HEAD>Energy, Ecology Officials Defend Controversial Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>

   The government says it will fire up Mexico's
first nuclear power plant next week, but critics are demanding a
national referendum on the twin-reactor project.
   Jose Luis Alcudia, the assistant energy secretary, told the
Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday that the Laguna Verda reactor is
ready for low-level operational testing.
   Officials maintained that the plant poses no threat to the
environment and that testing would begin next week.
   ``The environmental controls of the nuclear plant are
guaranteed,'' assistant ecology secretary Sergio Reyes Lujan told
the chamber.
   But opposition lawmakers disputed their testimony and called on
the government to hold a national referendum on the plant.
   The plant, 200 miles east of Mexico City in Veracruz state, has
been ready for the loading of radioactive fuel since December,
according to the federal Electricity Commission.
   But President Miguel de la Madrid postponed the start-up in an
apparent attempt to calm protests by environmental groups and to
minimize the issue during Veracruz state's municipal elections.
   The elections, held Oct. 2, were largely won by the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party. Newspapers have since carried a
flurry of unconfirmed reports that the loading is imminent.
   Officials of the Energy Department, state-owned Federal
Electricity Commission and Urban Development and Ecology Department
spoke to senators on Tuesday and testified in the Chamber of
Deputies on Wednesday.
   Alcudia said the plant is part of a long-range plan to diversify
energy sources.
   The first of the two 657-megawatt reactors is ready for
low-level power tests and that there are no technical obstacles to
loading fuel, he said.
   Sen. Porfirio Munoz Ledo of the leftist National Democratic
Front and leaders of the Group of 100, an ecological group of
artists and intellectuals, walked out of Tuesday's session, the
newspaper La Jornada said.
   Munoz Ledo questioned the economics of the plant considering the
decline in income from oil exports. He also questioned the safety
of the plant.
   ``Why the rush to load the reactor?'' he asked.
   Construction on the plant began in 1973. The second of the two
reactors is to be ready by 1991.

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis tended to last-minute
preparations for the second and final round of their presidential
campaign debates as polls suggested that the Democratic nominee
must deliver a solid punch tonight to overcome his Republican rival.
   The two White House contenders, in a day filled with sports
metaphors _ and even a sporting event _ hinted Wednesday at their
strategy for their face-to-face confrontation.
   ``Fastball, curve, slider _ maybe a knuckler,'' Dukakis said
when asked what he planned to toss at Bush tonight.
   The vice president said he hoped to show the American people
``what my heartbeat is, what I really care about.''
   Neither Bush nor Dukakis planned any campaign appearances today.
The two candidates were conducting walk-throughs of the debate area
before their 9 p.m. EDT clash at Pauley Pavilion, better known as
the home of the University of California at Los Angeles basketball
team.
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle was
campaigning in Montana, Oklahoma and Arkansas while his
counterpart, Lloyd Bentsen, was on Capitol Hill, urging Democrats
in Congress to wrap up their session quickly and hit the campaign
trail for the Democratic ticket.
   Polls released Wednesday showed the GOP nominee leading solidly
in the state-by-state race for Electoral College votes, although
nationwide surveys suggest a close race.
   An ABC News-Washington Post 50-state poll found Bush leading
firmly in 21 states with 220 electoral votes _ 50 shy of the total
needed to win the presidency. Dukakis led in three states and the
District of Columbia for 30 electoral votes.
   The poll of 9,778 likely voters was conducted from Sept. 21
through Monday. Margins of error ranged from five to 10 percentage
points in each state where 100 to 500 voters were interviewed.
   States in Bush's column included Texas and its electoral prize
of 29 votes, and New Jersey, with 16 electoral votes. California,
with the biggest electoral prize of 47 votes, was leaning toward
Bush as was New York and its 36 electoral votes, according to the
ABC-Post poll.

   However, a survey released today by The Buffalo News found
Dukakis holding a 9 percent lead over Bush _ 49 percent to 40
percent _ in New York state, including a commanding 62 percent to
28 percent lead in the New York City area.
   Political-Media Research Inc. of Washington, D.C., conducted the
survey of 850 registered voters Monday and Tuesday. The poll had a
margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.

   The ABC-Post poll also conducted a standard national survey of
1,187 likely voters and found Bush leading Dukakis 51 percent to 45
percent. The survey, conducted Oct. 5 through Tuesday, had a margin
of error of four percentage points.
   A CBS News-New York Times poll had nearly the same result: 50-45
for Bush. That survey of 1,009 probable voters was done Oct. 8
through Monday and also had a four-point margin of error.
   Horserace polls indicate popular strength nationwide, but the
Electoral College decides the winner.
   Bush called the state-by-state survey ``interesting and
encouraging,'' but said he would stick to his strategy. Dukakis
adviser Ron Brown disputed GOP claims that Bush has the backing of
the South, West and Rocky Mountain states, and said the Electoral
College race is still close.
   ``I think you see a scenario, a very reasonable, rational
scenario, that indicates this thing is nowhere near over,'' Brown
said.
   Aides to Dukakis believe a solid showing by the Democratic
nominee in the 90-minute, prime-time encounter with Bush will help
propel their candidate to the lead in the close race.
   Unlike the first presidential debate on Sept. 25, when
candidates and aides tried to set low expectations, Dukakis was
predicting a win.
   ``We're ahead 2-0 and we're going to make it a clean sweep,''
Dukakis said, referring to his debate with Bush and Bentsen's
confrontation with Quayle.
   Bush also expressed confidence heading into the debate, telling
reporters on Wednesday: ``We do seem to be looking a little
stronger politically these days.''
   Quayle, campaigning in Montana, advised his running mate to
``hit it over centerfield,'' and added, ``He'll do very well.''
Bentsen said Dukakis should ``hang loose.''
   The vice president said he would cite fewer statistics in the
debate and talk more about ``how I would like to lead this country,
where I'd like to see us be in the '90s if I'm elected president.''
   Bush then headed off to Dodger Stadium where he watched the Los
Angeles Dodgers defeat the New York Mets 6-0 to capture the
National League pennant and win a spot in baseball's World Series.
   ``Great night. I'll tell you, once in awhile you luck into
something really fun,'' Bush told reporters who accompanied him to
the game. ``Can't say that, once in awhile, we don't get a break in
life.''

   The military is shutting down the Biggin Hill air
base in southern England, which played a key role in repelling Nazi
air attacks during the Battle of Britain.
   On Wednesday, Roger Freeman, a junior undersecretary at the
Defense Ministry, said the Royal Air Force will close the base in
the next few months.
   The RAF stopped flying at Biggin Hill in 1959 and turned it into
an officer and aircrew selection center. Freeman said the center
would move to the RAF College at Cranwell in eastern England ``as
part of our continuing search for economy and efficiency.''
   From July to October 1940 Nazi Germany tried but failed to wipe
out British air defenses ahead of an anticipated sea-borne invasion.
   Despite major losses, heavily outnumbered British fighters from
Biggin Hill and other bases wore down the Germans in daily battles
over southern England as crowds on the ground gathered outdoors in
bright summer sunshine to watch the savage dogfights overhead.
   The British, backed by an early warning system based on the
newly discovered principle of radar, had 700 fighters against
Germany's 2,800 planes.

   Michael Dukakis debates presidential rival
George Bush for the second and final time tonight in what could
prove the crucial test of whether the Democrat can reassert himself
in the race for the White House.
   Dukakis was spending most of today in final preparation for the
showdown, taking a brief afternoon break to visit the University of
California at Los Angeles auditorium where he and the Republican
vice president will meet face-to-face at 9 p.m. EDT in a nationally
broadcast encounter.
   Dukakis has been loose and upbeat heading into the debate
despite the widely held belief that a strong performance is vital
to his hopes of overcoming what polls show is a close horserace but
a strong Bush lead in the Electoral College count.
   ``We're going to win, period,'' was the Massachusetts governor's
optimistic assessment Wednesday when asked if he thought it
possible that he would win the popular vote but lose the presidency
to Bush in the electoral count.
   That comment came during a game of catch with press secretary
Dayton Duncan, during which Dukakis, using baseball metaphors,
joked about his planned repertoire for the debate.
   ``Fastball, curve, slider _ maybe a knuckler,'' he said when
asked what he planned to throw at Bush tonight.
   Candidates and aides generally try to lower their expectations
going into a debate but Dukakis predicted a win.
   ``We're ahead 2-0 and we're going to make it a clean sweep,'' he
said, claiming victory in his prior debate with Bush and the recent
matchup between the vice presidential nominees, Democrat Lloyd
Bentsen and Republican Dan Quayle.
   Quayle, the conservative Indiana senator, will be a prime
Dukakis target in tonight's encounter, with the Democratic nominee
looking to both question Quayle's qualifications to step in as
president and Bush's judgment in selecting the 41-year-old senator.
   ``Gingerly,'' Dukakis said with a broad grin when asked how Bush
should handle debate questions about Quayle.
   Aides said Dukakis also planned aggressive responses to any
questions about the Massachusetts prison furlough system, a
favorite Bush target in his effort to paint Dukakis as soft on
crime.
   Dukakis aides believe their candidate has gained some momentum
in recent weeks, particularly through the vice presidential debate,
and hope a strong performance tonight will give Dukakis a boost to
carry him through the final 25 days of the campaign.
   In that period Dukakis will target the Northeast, the industrial
heartland, the West Coast and selected Southern, border and Midwest
and Rocky Mountain states in hope of breaking the GOP's electoral
lock.
   ``I think you see a scenario, a very reasonable, rational
scenario, that indicates this thing is nowhere near over,'' said
senior Dukakis adviser Ron Brown, who said most targeting decisions
would be made within a few days after the debate.
   Dukakis was attending a rally with supporters after the debate
and also attending two private receptions. He was campaigning
Friday in California and Washington state, including a joint
appearance with Bentsen in Sacramento.

   Gov. Madeleine Kunin couldn't ask for a
better backdrop as she seeks a third two-year term: the nation's
lowest unemployment rate, surging revenues and a doubling of state
aid to schools in four years.
   Yet, Kunin's re-election next month is not assured.
   The Democratic incumbent is favored to defeat Republican Michael
Bernhardt for the two-year post, but a poll for Bernhardt last
month found one-third of the voters undecided, with Kunin leading
Bernhardt 38-32 percent.
   Of even greater concern to Kunin was the fact that, according to
the survey, the number of people who disapproved of her performance
had climbed to 38 percent.
   The governor has belatedly acknowledged that the challenge by
Bernhardt is more serious than first anticipated. ``I think this is
going to be closer than what most people think,'' Kunin said
recently.
   Close elections are nothing new for Kunin. The state's first
female governor was elected in 1984, narrowly defeating the
then-attorney general by gaining 50.02 percent of the vote.
   Two years ago, she gained 47 percent of the vote in a three-way
race and forced the election into the Legislature, as the
Constitution requires when no one receives a majority of the
popular vote.
   Kunin believes Bernhardt's inroads have come through negative
campaigning. ``It has an effect in every race,'' she said. ``I
think we have seen that nationally. I don't think I am immune.''
   But Bernhardt believes his campaign is catching on because
Vermonters are tired of being told what to do by the state. The
centerpiece of his campaign is a pledge to erase many of the rules
and regulations drawn up during the Kunin administration.
   ``The role of state government is a helping hand, not an iron
fist,'' said Bernhardt as he and Kunin met last week in their first
televised debate.
   To Bernhardt the election is a ``referendum on what Vermonters
want as a form of government. Do we want a continuation of the
direction you have taken us in, state control, big state spending,
more mandates, or do we want a government founded on people?''
   This is Bernhardt's first bid for statewide office. A
businessman from Londonderry, he has served in the Vermont House
for eight years, most recently as the Republican leader.
   Kunin says she is proud of what her administration has
accomplished and believes she will do well if she can ``get the
word out on what we have done,'' especially in the area of the
environment and education.''
   ``I am glad I am a strong environmentalist; that I have put my
neck out on these laws and I am going to fight to put them there
and not backtrack,'' she said.
   Chief among the environmental successes cited by the governor is
a highly controversial law adopted this year designed to ease
development pressures in this state of 548,000 people.
   Passage of the law stemmed from growing fears among many that
development, primarily vacation homes and resorts, was threatening
to destroy the small-town simplicity of the nation's most rural
state.
   Bernhardt, although supportive of the growth law in concept, has
tried to tap Vermonters' love of the small town by painting the
Kunin growth bill as an attempt to rob local governments of their
powers.
   He says the law gives too much say over local planning to
regional planning commissions and the state. Kunin disputes that,
saying towns can elect whether or not to participate in the
planning.
   Kunin's greatest asset is the strength of Vermont's economy.
Vermont, with its small population, has always had a very high per
capita tax burden. New England's recent economic boom has changed
that, raising income and lowering tax burden. Even so, state
coffers are so full that aid to education has doubled in four years.
   The latest unemployment rate was 1.7 percent, the lowest ever
recorded by a state under the present calculation system and the
nation's best.
   ``I'm proud of what we have done,'' said Kunin. ``We have gone
from deficit to surplus; we have a record low unemployment rate,
and we have done it all while protecting our environment.''

   As George Bush readies for his second and
final debate with Michael Dukakis, the Republican presidential
nominee is voicing optimism about his chances in the prime-time
confrontation and on Election Day.
   ``We do seem to be looking a little stronger politically these
days,'' the vice president said Wednesday as polls suggested he
held a solid electoral vote lead over his Democratic opponent.
   An ABC News-Washington Post 50-state poll showed Bush leading
firmly in 21 states with 220 electoral votes _ 50 shy of the total
needed to win the presidency. Dukakis led in three states and the
District of Columbia for 30 electoral votes.
   Bush planned no public appearances today before the debate. He
was planning a morning walk-through of Pauley Pavilion on the
University of California at Los Angeles campus and then was
spending the rest of the day preparing for the debate with aides.
   On Wednesday, Bush said that in the debate, he would seek to
make it clearer to Americans ``what my heart beat is, what I really
care about.''
   Aides to the Republican nominee said they expect a surprise
assault from Dukakis.
   ``He's the one who has to figure out some way to get his
campaign started. He's not been able to do it. Desperate men do
desperate things,'' Bush adviser James Lake said of Dukakis.
   Lake head up a team of Bush aides and advisers in Los Angeles to
put a favorable spin on the vice president's performance, and he
was warming up even in advance of tonight's event.
   ``Dukakis is not able to break out of the rut he is in,'' Lake
said Wednesday.
   Bush's campaign chairman, James A. Baker III, told reporters
that the campaign will be prepared against any possible surprise
tactic by Dukakis.
   Added Baker: ``I think that if the vice president does what he
did the first time, that is appear presidential and draw the
contrast between himself and Governor Dukakis, that's what we'd be
looking for.''
   Bush's press spokeswoman, Sheila Tate, said, ``He's pretty good
at dodging and weaving. I don't think we'll worry too much about
unexpected blows.''
   Today, ``we expect more batting practice with his team'' of
debate advisers, including Baker, media consultant Roger Ailes and
former Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, according to Ms.
Tate.
   On Wednesday night, Bush took time out to attend the final game
of the National League Championship Series between the Los Angeles
Dodgers and the New York Mets. The Dodgers defeated the Mets 6-0 to
win the pennant and a berth in the World Series.
   ``Great night. I'll tell you, once in awhile you luck into
something really fun,'' Bush told reporters who accompanied him to
the game. ``Can't say that, once in awhile, we don't get a break in
life.''
   Bush watched the game with his wife, Barbara, and campaign
chairman Baker in a box belonging to Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley.
   The ABC-Post poll of 9,778 likely voters was conducted from
Sept. 21 through Monday. Margins of error ranged from five to 10
percentage points in each state where 100 to 500 voters were
interviewed.

   A cancer that causes pink to dark purple spots
on the skin of some people with AIDS may be triggered in part by a
single gene of the AIDS virus, according to a study published today.
   Researchers who added the virus gene to the genetic material of
mice found that the animals later developed a skin disease that
resembles the cancer, called Kaposi's sarcoma.
   The study may help in developing new therapies for Kaposi's,
said study co-author Gilbert Jay, chief of the cell physiology
section of the National Cancer Institute.
   Since Kaposi's appears in some people not infected with the AIDS
virus, the virus does not seem to play a role in all cases, he said
in a recent telephone interview.
   Jay reports the work in today's issue of the British journal
Nature with researchers from the institute and the University of
California, Davis.
   Kaposi's sarcoma is a generally uncommon cancer that appears
with unusual frequency in acquired immune deficiency syndrome, with
about 95 percent of AIDS-related cases among homosexual men.
Scientists have not explained those patterns, nor an apparent
recent decline of Kaposi's in new AIDS cases.
   Current treatment controls Kaposi's but does not cure it, and
the disease itself only rarely kills AIDS patients, said Alvin
Friedman-Kien, professor of dermatology and microbiology at the New
York University Medical Center.
   He called the study exciting, but said it still does not explain
the concentration of AIDS-related Kaposi's in homosexual men, since
all infected people are exposed to the AIDS virus.
   The mouse study focused on the ``tat'' gene of the virus, which
normally switches on other viral genes to speed reproduction.
Researchers injected fertilized mouse eggs with the gene plus the
genetic switch that normally activates it. The eggs were then
implanted in female mice.
   Many of the resulting newborn carried the gene in every cell of
their bodies. But it appeared to be active only in skin cells.
   Thirty-three of 37 male mice with the gene developed patches of
extensive cell proliferation in the skin, and about 15 percent of
the male mice developed skin tumors.
   The patches and tumors resembled Kaposi's sarcoma, which is
generally not seen in mice, researchers said. No female mice showed
the lesions or tumors, just as human Kaposi's is concentrated in
men, researchers said.
   Tumor cells showed no evidence of an active tat gene. Perhaps an
active tat gene induces a cell to produce some kind of substance
like a growth factor that encourages cancer in a second cell, Jay
said.
   So the cancerous cell itself would not have an active tat gene,
and the virus would have caused the disease indirectly, he said.
   Late last month, Dr. Robert Gallo of the cancer institute
confirmed press reports that institute researchers had found a
protein they called ``growth factor X'' that may let Kaposi's
spread.
   AIDS researcher Jay Levy of the University of California, San
Francisco, said the mouse study will ``offer a direction in terms
of understanding the way a potential cancer can occur without a
virus being directly present or expressed in the cancer.''
   In a second Nature paper, researchers from the National
Institutes of Health reported that a protein found on the outside
of the AIDS virus killed mouse brain cells in the test tube. Such a
process in people may help account for mental troubles such as
memory loss and dementia often seen in people with AIDS, they said.

   K mart is recalling two types of squeeze toys
and some telephone-shaped rattles which could pose choking hazards
for children.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday some
81,000 ``Baby's First Squeeze Toys'' and about 75,000 ``Baby's
First Playball'' squeeze toys, plus about 33,000 plastic
``Telephone Receiver Rattles'' are being recalled.
   All three products went on sale in late 1987, the agency said.
The squeeze toys cost about $1 and the rattles $2. Parents were
urged to remove all three toys from use and to return them to K
mart for a refund.
   Baby's First Squeeze Toy came in three shapes: telephone
receiver, barbell and dumbbell, while the playball came in the form
of a baseball, basketball or soccer ball.

   American and Soviet officials are setting up a
``hotline'' to prevent accusations against each other's countries
from escalating into worldwide propaganda campaigns, Charles Z.
Wick, head of the U.S. Information Agency said.
   ``Agreement to work toward the establishment of an `early

of U.S.-Soviet information talks in Moscow Sept. 26-28, said Wick.
   The ``early warning system'' would be ``designed to give the
United States a mechanism to challenge disinformation efforts
before they become part of a worldwide campaign,'' Wick said in a
speech Wednesday at the National Press Club.
   Wick said the Soviets have ``curtailed dramatically''
circulation of disinformation, but recalled hearing only a few days
ago a Moscow Radio broadcast about ``Western countries buying
children from impoverished South American countries and treating
them as slaves.''

   The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen and
most major currencies in Tokyo on Thursday while share prices
dipped on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   After opening at 127.90 yen, sharply down from the previous
day's close of 129.65, the dollar moved in a range of 127.75-128.35
yen. It closed at 127.98 yen, down 1.67 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the main index
in the Tokyo Stock Exchange, lost 136.07 points, or 0.50 percent,
to close at 27,273.30.
   Exchange dealers attributed the dollar's decline to market
perceptions that the U.S. economy was slowing down and to
nervousness over the August U.S. trade report scheduled to be
released later Thursday in Washington.
   ``The market appears to be over-reacting a bit, but there were
various elements since last week which could push the dollar
down,'' said Toshikazu Kotoge, a dealer at Yasuda Trust Bank in
Tokyo.
   Kotoge cited the lower-than-expected level of U.S. employment
rates released last week and growing speculation that the U.S.
trade deficit was worsening as negative elements affecting the
market last week.
   Kyodo News Service quoted Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa as
saying the yen's appreciation had been ``somewhat too steep.
   ``If the fluctuation is too wide for one day, it better be tamed
down,'' Miyazawa was quoted as saying.
   Miyazawa denied speculation that the United States had changed
its policy of favoring a dollar stronger than the current levels,
Kyodo reported.
   But dealers said it was unlikely the dollar would dip below the
125-yen level, as market players were likely to start buying the
dollar at that rate.
   The dollar's opening Thursday morning was the lowest since June
22, when the currency opened trading at 126.70 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, securities dealers said
uncertainties in the foreign exchange market sidelined investors.
   ``Most export-oriented shares are down because of the strong
yen, but domestic shares are doing all right,'' said Ichitaro
Watanabe of Nikko Securities Co. ``But either way, the market is
not going to move too much today (Thursday) ahead of the release of
U.S. trade numbers.''

<HEAD>Contractor Agrees To $115 Million Settlement For Defrauding
Pentagon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A defense contractor agreed to a $115 million
fine in the largest Pentagon fraud settlement after admitting it
billed the Defense Department for things like babysitting, country
clubs and servants for its executives, officials said.
   In agreeing to plead guilty to defrauding the Pentagon by
overbilling for airplane parts, Sundstrand Corp. also said its
employees wined and dined Defense Department officials and then
submitted those expenses for reimbursements, U.S. prosecutors said
Wednesday.
   No company or Pentagon employee has been charged in the
overbillings, which spanned from 1980-86, but Sundstrand agreed to
cooperate with investigators, said U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas. The
investigation should be completed by January, said Valukas, who
declined to estimate how much Sundstrand's actions cost the
government.
   ``It was the object of the conspiracy to improve Sundstrand's
ability to market hardware to the Defense Department by giving
gratuities to Defense Department personnel and their spouses while
concealing (their) identity,'' the government said.
   Sundstrand employees gave an estimated $100,000 worth of liquor,
meals, motel rooms, golf outings and tickets to the theater,
hockey, football and baseball games, the government said. They then
submitted expense reports identifying the Defense Department
workers they entertained only as a ``customer'' or ``government
employee,'' the complaint said.
   Some government employees are being investigated for allegedly
accepting the gratuities, said Larry Wilson, a spokesman for the
department's Defense Logistics Agency.
   The company also admitted it submitted fraudulent claims to the
Defense Department for what it called ``general and administrative
costs'' on its contracts.
   These claims included millions of dollars in unallowable costs
for such things as ``liquor, babysitting, gifts, travel by
executives' spouses, cigarettes, candy, saunas, golf, tennis,
country club dues, movies, jewelry, clothes, ... snowplowing at
executives' homes, radar detectors, ... entertainment, ... and
servants for executives and their spouses,'' the government said.
   Evans W. Erikson, Sundstrand chairman and chief executive
officer, said in a statement the agreement to plead guilty at an
undetermined date was a ``major step toward putting this
unfortunate chapter behind the company.''
   Sundstrand makes flight-data equipment and other electronic
equipment for military and commercial aircraft. It also makes the
``black box'' equipment installed on aircraft to preserve flight
information in the event of a crash.
   Rockford-based Sundstrand had set aside $130 million in
anticipation of settling the federal investigations, said company
spokesman Claude Vernam.
   Sundstrand said it already had paid or agreed to pay a total of
$127.3 million to settle overbillings in Illinois and Washington
state.
   The Defense Department accounts for 42 percent of Sundstrand's
$1.4 billion in annual sales, and Sundstrand acknowledged that it
could be suspended or barred from future work on federal contracts.
   ``What you have, in a sense, is a tragedy,'' Valukas said at a
news conference. ``You have a company that set out to defraud the
government.
   ``The only way that type of activity can be deterred is through
swift legal action,'' Valukas said.
   The penalty set for the company is the largest single Pentagon
fraud settlement ever, Valukas said.
   The previous record was in March, when Bell Helicopter Textron
Inc. agreed to return $90 million to the government to settle
allegations it fraudulently overcharged the Army on helicopter
spare parts, according to the Pentagon.

<HEAD>Aquino Says No Fixed Timetable For Charging Marcos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philippines will file criminal
charges against Ferdinand Marcos for alleged offenses committed in
office but no specific time had been set, President Corazon Aquino
said today.
   Mrs. Aquino also said Marcos, who was president of the
Philippines for 20 years but fled to exile in Hawaii in 1986, will
be allowed to return to the Philippines to answer the charges.
   Mrs. Aquino issued a statement to reporters one day after a
Filipino official indicated the government might delay filing
charges against the ousted president until U.S. authorities decide
whether to prosecute him.
   ``Sometime in the future, we will file a criminal case or cases
against Mr. Marcos,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``At that time, we will
have to allow him to return to face the trial. No definite time
frame can be given as of now for this.''
   The Philippine government alleges Marcos and his associates
stole up to $10 billion before his administration was toppled in
the 1986 uprising that swept Mrs. Aquino to power.
   Filipino officials have filed no criminal charges against Marcos
for fear he would demand his right to return home for trial.
Philippine law bars criminal trials in absentia.
   On Tuesday, the Los Angeles Times said the U.S. State
Department's legal officer, Abraham Sofaer, recommended Marcos be
offered a deal to avoid prison by surrendering millions of dollars
allegedly embezzled during 20 years in power.
   The newspaper said U.S. officials feared Marcos would seek to
embarrass American and Filipino authorities by disclosing improper
or illegal conduct if he were indicted.
   The plea bargain proposal reportedly involves an investigation
of Marcos by U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani in New York into
alleged illegal money transfers and other activities.
   On Wednesday, Mateo Caparas, chairman of the Presidential
Commission on Good Government, said the Aquino administration would
not ``seek to obstruct justice in other lands'' or permit filing of
charges here ``to be used as an excuse by Mr. Marcos to escape his
indictment abroad.''
   Caparas said efforts by Marcos to return were ``either an excuse
to get out of America or a part of his campaign to destabilize the
present government.'' The official said Marcos could face charges
here even if he accepted a U.S. plea bargain.
   Caparas' commission is in charge of recovering money allegedly
taken by Marcos. He told reporters that Mrs. Aquino had asked him
to issue the statement.
   Mrs. Aquino has repeatedly refused to allow Marcos to return to
the Philippines, citing national security.
   Today, Mrs. Aquino said she was confident that her government
would ``be able to handle the return of Mr. Marcos when the time
for it comes.''

<TEXT>
   President Richard von Weizsaecker
is urging fellow West Germans to recall the horrors of Auschwitz,
rejecting attempts to compare the Nazi Holocaust with other
atrocities in human history.
   ``What is it supposed to mean for us, whether Auschwitz can
stand up to a comparison of the horrifying destruction of other
peoples?'' Weizsaecker said in the northern Bavarian city of
Bamberg on Wednesday.
   ``Auschwitz remains unique. It happened in the name of the
Germans, by Germans. This truth is irrefutable, and it won't be
forgotten,'' he said.
   In recent years, West Germans have come to use the name of the
Nazis' Auschwitz death camp synonymously with the Holocaust.
   Weizsaecker addressed a national conference of prominent
historians, as towns and cities across West Germany plan solemn
ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the infamous 1938
``Crystal Night'' violence aimed against Jews.
   The comments by the highly popular West German president on
Wednesday marked the first time he has entered a bitter public
debate over whether the Nazi killings of 6 million Jews and
hundreds of thousands of others stand alone in history.
   Conservative historians led by Ernst Nolte of West Berlin argue
the Holocaust can be ``relativized'' by comparisons with
Stalinist-era atrocities and other mass-killings in history.
   Jewish leaders angrily claim the conservative historians'
ultimate goal is to diminish the horrors of Adolf Hitler's Nazi
regime in the eyes of future generations.
   Speaking of the Nazi era, the 68-year-old president said: ``It
(Germany) was led by criminals, and it let itself be led by
criminals.''
   ``It (the German people) knows this, especially where it would
rather not know,'' he said in a copy of the speech distributed to
the news media by his office in Bonn.
   During the Nazi era, Weizsaecker's father, Ernst von
Weizsaecker, was the No. 2 official in the Foreign Ministry and was
sent to prison for his conviction at one of the Nuremberg war
crimes trials. However, the president often has defended his father
in public, saying he did his best to head off World War II.
   The West German president spoke exactly four weeks before the
50th anniversary of ``Crystal Night,'' when hundreds of Jewish
synagogues were burned down, thousands of Jewish homes and
businesses plundered, and 30,000 Jews sent to concentration camps.
   It took the name ``Crystal Night'' because of the shards of
broken glass during the action Nov. 9-10, 1938. German Jewish
leaders have begun referring to it as the ``Pogrom Night,'' saying
that is a more appropriate word for it.
   Commemorative plaques are being erected at important Jewish
buildings, panel discussions are being held and a major ceremony is
scheduled in Frankfurt to mark the 50th anniversary.

   South and North Korean delegations met
for the first time since the Olympics today, but failed to make
progress in their efforts to find ways to reunite their divided
land.
   Each side accused the other of blocking progress during the
two-hour meeting, but agreed to resume talks on Nov. 17.
   ``The northern side took an insincere stand throughout, and
there was no progress,'' Lee Han-dong, a South Korean delegate,
told a news conference.
   ``The South's position was basically the same as before and they
made no concessions at all,'' said the chief North Korean
negotiator, Chon Kum Chol.
   Today's meeting was aimed at arranging formal talks between the
two Koreas' legislatures on reuniting the peninsula.
   North Korea, slightly revising its earlier stand, suggested that
the proposed legislative talks include one-third of the lawmakers
from the north, or 218 people, and one-half of the south's
lawmakers, or 150 people.
   South Korea came up with a new proposal calling for largely
ceremonial opening and closing ceremonies attended by all members
of the two sides' legislatures and a smaller ``select'' committee
charged with actual negotiations.
   Previously, North Korea had called for a joint meeting of the
nearly 1,000 members of the two sides' parliaments. South Korea has
sought a smaller meeting, saying it would allow for more practical
negotiations.
   The nations first began discussions on Aug. 21 on possible
formal talks between their parliaments, but made no major progress
in four meetings. In the fourth session on Aug. 26, each accused
the other of blocking agreement, but they agreed to resume the
discussions after the Olympics.
   South Korean delegates, elated by their country's success
hosting the games, said just prior to today's talks that they would
be more willing to compromise.
   But afterward, South Korea's senior delegate Park Joon-kyu told
reporters: ``The North Koreans remain unchanged for the past 30
years. My feeling is that they need time to study our proposals.''
   Park said he thought that ``the atmosphere (of today's meeting)
is a little better now, after the Olympics.'' He said the North
``might have sensed our sincerity.''
   But bitterness over the games was still evident today.
   ``The Olympics are supposed to be a festival of peace and
goodwill,'' Chon said. By hosting the Olympics alone, he said South
Korea ``had split the nation.''
   North Korea had demanded that it co-host the Olympics, but the
International Olympic Committee rejected the bid, saying the
Olympics are awarded to a single city and cannot be shared.
   The peninsula was divided in 1945 into communist North Korea and
capitalist South Korea. They fought the bloody three-year Korean
War in 1950-53.

   A snake-swallowing act has come under fire
from the Utah Humane Society, which says it may ask the Legislature
to outlaw the practice.
   Ron Stewart's reptile-gobbling performance came five months ago
during the ``What's the Craziest Thing You Would Do for a
Motorcycle'' contest. The competition was sponsored by the
Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. of Logan-Ogden, KJQ Radio and Newgate
Yamaha.
   In its fall newsletter, the society denounced Stewart's act,
which placed third. The contest was won by 21-year-old Jenise
Merrill of Ogden, who covered herself in liquid cow manure and
rolled in cornflakes.
   ``If they want to make idiots of themselves, that's their
business,'' said Katharine Brant, the society's director of
development. ``But when it involves animals who can't defend
themselves, that's when we step in.''
   The animal-protection group reported that the snake was eaten
alive, but Stewart, 25, said the reptile actually was killed
shortly before he ate it.

   Karen guerrillas have recaptured
outposts seized by Burmese government troops more than four years
ago, a rebel official said today.
   The rebels Wednesday captured several hills at Methawaw on the
western bank of the Moei River that separates Burma and Thailand,
said the official who asked not to be named. Fighting for the
strategic hills began Sept. 26.
   The Karens, the strongest armed opponents of the Rangoon
government, lost the area in April 1984 to the Burmese army.
   The Karen official also said rebel camps on the Thai border were
preparing for government attacks.
   Burmese leader Gen. Saw Maung ``regards us as his enemy so his
orders may involve more attacks on our camps,'' he said, referring
to Thay Baw Bo and Kle Day camps that house more than 4,000
students and other Burmese.
   Students were at the forefront of recent, pro-democracy
demonstrations in Burma, but were driven underground by Saw Maung's
troops, who by official count have killed about 450 people since a
Sept. 18 military coup.
   Several thousand have fled to the Thai-Burmese border seeking
refuge and military training from ethnic minorities, including the
Karens, who are also fighting the central governemnt.
   The official said he had no details on casualty figures and
reported no fighting today between the rebels and the army.
   ``We didn't encircle them this time because that involves heavy
losses of lives on both sides,'' he said. ``For retreat, we left
them a way out.''

be yet to come.
   This once-quiet rural northeast Oklahoma town's City Council is
seeking a grand jury investigation into months of claims of
misconduct by ex-Police Chief Charles Crawford and counterclaims of
racial bias.
   ``I'm sure that this thing is not over yet,'' said Mayor Steve
Tilley, whose town of 3,000 residents includes about 150 blacks.
``It may drag on for years.''
   Crawford, who has been married 11 years, said city officials who
opposed having a black chief conspired to oust him, using
allegations that he had affairs with white police dispatchers to
raise the ire of the City Council.
   ``The only difference in these days and the old days is that
people don't use ropes anymore,'' said Crawford, referring to
lynchings in the old South. ``They use a lot of trickery and
politics to keep you exactly where they want you.''
   No criminal charges have been filed against Crawford, who was
police chief for nine years, but allegations in testimony to city
investigators included sexual involvement with dispatchers, sexual
harassment of other female employees, preferential treatment for
some residents and harsh handling of others.
   City Manager Paul O'Keefe, who serves at the council's
discretion, fired Crawford last Thursday, saying only that he did
it ``for the good of the service.'' O'Keefe is out of town and
unavailable for comment until Friday, officials said.
   A day after Crawford's firing, police Lt. Dave Pillars and
Officer Randy Walling were forced to resign, leaving a police force
of two. Tilley said the resignations were accepted because ``they
went along with what their chief said and did.''
   Both officers said they were shocked when asked to resign. ``If
someone had told me six years ago my career was going to end like
this, I wouldn't believe them,'' Pillars said.
   On Monday, Municipal Judge Bill Hall resigned after
acknowledging he had signed blank warrants later used by police in
arrests. Blank warrants were found during the council's
investigation of Crawford.
   Hall denied wrongdoing, saying the Crawford controversy that led
to his resignation was the result of ``a gross misunderstanding of
certain facts.''
   Osage County District Attorney Larry Stuart is reviewing the
council's 350-page investigative report and said state
investigators may be called in if necessary.
   The council requested that a grand jury review its report, but
Tilley said he does not believe a panel will be called. District
Judge J.R. Pearman said he does not expect to rule on the grand
jury request before next month.
   Crawford, 45, has denied all the allegations, saying disgruntled
fired employees, unidentified accusers and jealous women are making
the charges.
   Tilley denies anyone on the five-member council, all white,
conspired against Crawford because he is black, but said at least
two council members who initially called for the investigation and
his resignation have not hidden their dislike for Crawford.
   Tilley said testimony presented to city investigators accusing
Crawford of sexual relationships with four unidentified juvenile
women led to his firing. But the claims, which came in interviews
with city investigators, were supported by little evidence, he said.
   ``It's kind of like why have your house fireproofed if you've
never had a fire,'' Tilley said. ``When your dealing with the
public, with a man in his position, you have to take every
precaution.''
   Crawford said city officials have refused to identify his
juvenile accusers so that he can disprove their claims.
   Crawford, who grew up in Hominy along with 18 brothers and
sisters, was suspended with pay Sept. 6, two weeks after former
dispatcher Becky Rulo, 27, contacted a Tulsa newspaper and
councilman Foster Johnson with claims that she is carrying
Crawford's baby. She filed her paternity lawsuit against Crawford
on Monday, saying she is four months pregnant.
   Two taped telephone conversations between Crawford and Miss Rulo
prompted the council's call Sept. 8 for an investigation of the
department, Tilley said. Crawford, who has two children and has
served as a foster parent for 10 years to dozens of children, said
he will take a blood test to prove he is not the father of Miss
Rulo's child.

   Kidnappers in Lebanon have increasingly fewer
reasons to hold British hostages and the prospects for their
release continue to improve, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe said
today.
   Howe said an easing of tensions in the Middle East should
improve the climate for the release of the hostages.
   ``I think that if we continue to see progress towards a calmer
state of affairs in all the troubled areas in the Middle East, then
the reason _ and there is no justifiable reason _ that people are
being held hostage, begins to disappear,'' Howe said.
   Howe met four former French hostages Wednesday in Brighton,
where his Conservative Party is holding its annual convention. He
spoke today on British Broadcasting Corp. television.
   ``There are reasons to believe that the prospects (of release)
are getting better rather than worse,'' he said. ``But I don't want
to raise false hopes. I have no news today or tomorrow of any
significant change in the position.''
   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals believed
held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists: Anglican
Church envoy Terry Waite, journalist John McCarthy and teacher
Brian Keenan. Keenan, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, has dual
British and Irish nationality.
   Howe reiterated that while Britain continued to ``press and
probe and search'' in every way possible to secure their release,
``it would not be right to engage in deals or bargains or surrender
to blackmail.''
   Nine Americans are among the foreign hostages missing in Lebanon.
   The longest held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped on March
16, 1985.

<HEAD>Magazine Ranks High-Stress, Low-Stress Cities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of cities cited by Psychology Today
magazine as the most stressful in the country reacted angrily to
the ranking, while the mayor of the nation's least stressed burg,
State College, Pa., was pleased.
   ``That's ridiculous,'' responded Little Rock, Ark., Chamber of
Commerce President Paul Harvel on Wednesday to his city's ranking
as the fifth most stressful place.
   Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Assistant City Manager Pete Witschenhe
said: ``I've lived in other areas of the country. My impression is
there isn't any more stress here than any other urban area.'' The
Fort Lauderdale area was ranked 12th most stressful, joining
several other Florida cities on the list.
   The article, written by Robert Levine, a California State
University psychologist in Fresno, Calif., ranked 286 metropolitan
areas based on rates of crime, suicide, alcoholism and divorce.
   The study, published in the magazine's November issue, provided
instant celebrity status to State College.
   ``I think people got a charge out of this,'' said State College
Mayor Arnold Addison. He attributed the low-stress rating of the
small city, known by its residents as Happy Valley, to the fact
that it's the home of Penn State University.
   Reno, Nev., was portrayed as the stress capital of the nation.
   Sgt. Karl Schmidt of the Reno Police Department said the
``divorce capital of the world'' was being unfairly penalized for a
high burglary rate resulting from tourists leaving valuables in
cars or hotel rooms.
   Levine said the 10 lowest-stress places were: State College;
Grand Forks, N.D.; St. Cloud, Minn.; Rochester, Minn.;
McAllen-Pharr-Edinburg, Texas; Altoona, Pa.; Bloomington, Ind.;
Provo-Orem, Utah; Utica, N.Y.; and Akron, Ohio.
   The 10 most stressful were: Reno; Las Vegas, Nev.; Miami;
Lakeland-Winter Haven, Fla.; North Little Rock-Little Rock; Panama
City, Fla.; Odessa, Texas; Jacksonville, Fla.; San
Francisco-Oakland; and Los Angeles-Long Beach, Calif.
   Levine and fellow researchers Kuni Miyake and Marta Lee said the
criteria they used to rank the cities are ``both causes and effects
of social stress, clearly an important element in psychological
well-being,'' he said.
   Previous studies unfairly ``assume that people who live under
better environmental, economic and cultural conditions are more
satisfied with their lives,'' he said.
   But psychologists, he said, ``have long recognized that
favorable living conditions don't always produce subjective
well-being.''
   He noted that ``the West and South, known for their mild
climates and easy living, ranked highest and second highest
respectively on all four types of pathology.''
   Art Ellick, executive director of Community Service Council of
Broward County, Fla., a human service umbrella agency, said parts
of Florida have earned the stressful ranking. Many whose lives are
on the brink of crisis are lured to south Florida by its of mild
climate and economic prosperity, he said.
   But when they arrive, without the support of family or friends,
their problems explode, he said.
   Others agreed that south Florida's mix of new arrivals, low
wages, high housing costs and rootlessness add up to trouble for
many and could lead to higher rates of alcoholism, divorce, crime
and suicide.
   ``It's really different down here, and I can understand why
there are suicides and alcoholism,'' said Todd Barton, who moved to
the Fort Lauderdale area from Alabama six months ago.
   ``There are so many pressures down here,'' he said. ``It forces
people into social disorder and deviant behavior.''
   Darlene Bowling, 18, a restaurant cook in Altoona, which was
ranked the sixth least-stressful city, said a little more stress
might do the western Pennsylvania town good.
   ``I don't like it,'' she said of Altoona's relaxed atmosphere.
``I want something more wild.''

<HEAD>Foreign Ministry Denies Israeli Reports of Warming Relations</HEAD>

   China's Foreign Ministry denied today reports
from Jerusalem that the two countries, which have no diplomatic
relations, are upgrading political, trade and cultural ties.
   Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua, at a weekly briefing, said
``there's no such a thing'' when asked about a statement by Israel
Foreign Ministry Director-General Avraham Tamir that full
diplomatic relations will be established ``in the very near
future.''
   Tamir said on Israel television Wednesday that diplomatic ties
with China depend on progress in Middle East peace talks, and would
be realized soon because the peace process cannot be stopped.
   China now allows some trade with Israel and Israeli Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres has held talks with his Chinese counterpart
at the United Nations the past two years.
   But China also has close relations with the Palestine Liberation
Organization and many Arab states, and says it will not normalize
relations with Jerusalem until Israel returns land occupied since
the 1967 Middle East War.
   Spokeswoman Li, asked about Israeli media reports confirmed by
Tamir that Israel would set up an academic center in Beijing, said:
``As far as I know there's no such a thing as establishing academic
centers in Israel or China.''
   She also gave qualified denials to Israeli reports that Yitzhak
Minervi, top economic official in the Foreign Ministry, recently
signed a trade agreement in Beijing, and that a Peking opera
delegation would soon visit Israel.
   ``So far as I know there's no such a thing,'' she said about the
Minervi visit, adding ``China has no economic and trade relations
with Israel. There's no such a thing either about the visit of the
Peking opera delegation to Israel.''

   Wintry weather slapped the East today with snow in four states
and freezing temperatures that snapped records in four cities.
   Frost and freeze warnings were posted from the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys to the Appalachians, and scattered frost was
expected as far south as Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama.
   Snow showers fell in northeast Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania and
northern New York state. Scattered snow showers fell in sections of
Vermont.
   Temperatures were in the upper teens and 20s across the upper
Great Lakes region, and in the 20s from southeast Ohio to the
central Appalachians.
   In Marquette, Mich., two low-temperature records were set in a
matter of minutes. Just before midnight Wednesday, the mercury
plunged to 20 degrees, setting a record for the date that was 5
degrees below the old mark set in 1967. By early today, the
temperature dropped to 19 degrees, a record for Oct. 13. The
previous record was 22 degrees set in 1974.
   Temperature records for Oct. 13 were also set in Columbus, Ohio;
Green Bay, Wis.; and Greer, S.C.
   Today's forecast called for rain across much of the Pacific
Northwest, snow showers over northern New England and mostly sunny
skies in the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 50s or 60s over
much of the country east of the Mississippi River; the 40s from the
northern and eastern Great Lakes to central New England; the 30s in
Maine; the 70s and 80s in much of the nation West of the
Mississippi; the 60s from the Pacific Northwest to the central
Pacific Coast; and the mid-90s in southwest Arizona.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 18
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 79 degrees at Blythe, Calif., and
Phoenix.

   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping said today China and
the Soviet Union are likely to hold a summit next year, according
to diplomatic sources. It would be the first such meeting in 30
years.
   Deng, in a meeting with Finnish President Mauno Koivisto, also
expressed confidence that long-strained relations between China and
the Soviet Union will improve, sources in the Finnish delegation
said.
   China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen is to travel to Moscow
later this year to discuss the proposed summit between Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Chinese leaders, and it is
generally believed Gorbachev will visit Beijing next year.
   Deng's statement was the first by a Chinese to predict that the
summit, the first since Nikita Khrushchev came to China in 1959,
will likely take place next year.
   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua said at a briefing today
that it was still too early to name a time or place for the summit.
   ``The timing for the meeting between the top leaders of the two
countries depends on whether the conditions are ripe or not,'' she
said. ``Now is the time for the creation of the conditions.''
   She said Deng and the Foreign Ministry held similar views on the
summit, but declined comment on Deng's prediction that the meeting
would take place next year.
   The Finnish sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Deng also brought up the ``three obstacles'' China has cited as
holding up the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations and said
Soviet support for Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia remains the most
serious.
   The other two are the Soviet military presence in Afghanistan
and the heavy Soviet troop concentration on the Sino-Soviet border.
   The two sides met to discuss the Cambodian question in Beijing
in August, and Qian is expected to take up the issue again in
Moscow in a bid to narrow differences on how to bring peace to
Cambodia.
   The sources said Deng did not say whether Qian will set a date
for the summit during his talks in the Soviet Union.
   A Xinhua News Agency report on the meeting today made no mention
of the summit.
   It only quoted Deng as saying political and economic relations
between China and the Soviet Union will never be the same as those
of the 1950s, when Moscow dominated Beijing. Deng said a new type
of relation with the Soviet Union will be based on principles of
peaceful coexistence, equality and mutual benefit and will not harm
the interests of any other country.
   China and the Soviet Union split over ideological differences in
1960 and have remained at political odds despite improving
economic, academic and cultural relations in recent years.
   Gorbachev has urged China to bury past differences and called
for dialogue between the two sides.
   The summit is likely to take place in Beijing because Deng, 84,
no longer travels abroad. Deng has retired from most of his party
and government posts, but is still the undisputed leader of the
nation in terms of setting policies.
   Gorbachev would also hold talks with Premier Li Peng and
Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, the two men
responsible for the day-to-day running of the government and the
ruling party.

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis tended to last-minute
preparations for the second and final round of their presidential
campaign debates as polls suggested that the Democratic nominee
must deliver a solid punch tonight to overcome his Republican rival.
   The two White House contenders, in a day filled with sports
metaphors _ and even a sporting event _ hinted Wednesday at their
strategy for their face-to-face confrontation.
   ``Fastball, curve, slider _ maybe a knuckler,'' Dukakis said
when asked what he planned to toss at Bush tonight.
   The vice president said he hoped to show the American people
``what my heartbeat is, what I really care about.''
   Neither Bush nor Dukakis planned any campaign appearances today.
The two candidates were conducting walk-throughs of the debate area
before their 9 p.m. EDT clash at Pauley Pavilion, better known as
the home of the University of California at Los Angeles basketball
team.
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle was
campaigning in Montana, Oklahoma and Arkansas while his
counterpart, Lloyd Bentsen, was on Capitol Hill, urging Democrats
in Congress to wrap up their session quickly and hit the campaign
trail for the Democratic ticket.
   Polls released Wednesday showed the GOP nominee leading solidly
in the state-by-state race for Electoral College votes, although
nationwide surveys suggest a close race.
   An ABC News-Washington Post 50-state poll found Bush leading
firmly in 21 states with 220 electoral votes _ 50 shy of the total
needed to win the presidency. Dukakis led in three states and the
District of Columbia for 30 electoral votes.
   The poll of 9,778 likely voters was conducted from Sept. 21
through Monday. Margins of error ranged from five to 10 percentage
points in each state where 100 to 500 voters were interviewed.
   States in Bush's column included Texas and its electoral prize
of 29 votes, and New Jersey, with 16 electoral votes. California,
with the biggest electoral prize of 47 votes, was leaning toward
Bush as was New York and its 36 electoral votes, according to the
ABC-Post poll.

   However, a survey released today by The Buffalo News found
Dukakis holding a 9 percent lead over Bush _ 49 percent to 40
percent _ in New York state, including a commanding 62 percent to
28 percent lead in the New York City area.
   Political-Media Research Inc. of Washington, D.C., conducted the
survey of 850 registered voters Monday and Tuesday. The poll had a
margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.

   The ABC-Post poll also conducted a standard national survey of
1,187 likely voters and found Bush leading Dukakis 51 percent to 45
percent. The survey, conducted Oct. 5 through Tuesday, had a margin
of error of four percentage points.
   A CBS News-New York Times poll had nearly the same result: 47-42
for Bush. That survey of 1,009 probable voters was done Oct. 8
through Monday and also had a four-point margin of error.
   Horserace polls indicate popular strength nationwide, but the
Electoral College decides the winner.
   Bush called the state-by-state survey ``interesting and
encouraging,'' but said he would stick to his strategy. Dukakis
adviser Ron Brown disputed GOP claims that Bush has the backing of
the South, West and Rocky Mountain states, and said the Electoral
College race is still close.
   ``I think you see a scenario, a very reasonable, rational
scenario, that indicates this thing is nowhere near over,'' Brown
said.
   Aides to Dukakis believe a solid showing by the Democratic
nominee in the 90-minute, prime-time encounter with Bush will help
propel their candidate to the lead in the close race.
   Unlike the first presidential debate on Sept. 25, when
candidates and aides tried to set low expectations, Dukakis was
predicting a win.
   ``We're ahead 2-0 and we're going to make it a clean sweep,''
Dukakis said, referring to his debate with Bush and Bentsen's
confrontation with Quayle.
   Bush also expressed confidence heading into the dbate, telling
reporters on Wednesday: ``We do seem to be looking a little
stronger politically these days.''
   Quayle, campaigning in Montana, advised his running mate to
``hit it over centerfield,'' and added, ``He'll do very well.''
Bentsen said Dukakis should ``hang loose.''
   The vice president said he would cite fewer statistics in the
debate and talk more about ``how I would like to lead this country,
where I'd like to see us be in the '90s if I'm elected president.''
   Bush then headed off to Dodger Stadium where he watched the Los
Angeles Dodgers defeat the New York Mets 6-0 to capture the
National League pennant and win a spot in baseball's World Series.
   ``Great night. I'll tell you, once in awhile you luck into
something really fun,'' Bush told reporters who accompanied him to
the game. ``Can't say that, once in awhile, we don't get a break in
life.''

<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng criticized reports that China,
faced with soaring inflation and economic turmoil, has abandoned
the modernization of its economy, the official news media reported
today.
   Li denied at a meeting of the State Council, or cabinet, that a
recently announced program to cool off the overheated economy is a
setback for China's market-oriented reforms.
   He said ``some domestic figures and members of the foreign
press'' have suggested that China's decision to ``improve the
economic environment and rectify the economic order'' over the next
two years means a halt in the reforms.
   ``All these doubts or hesitations show that such people have not
yet arrived at a full understanding of the relationship between the
key tasks of creating economic stability and bolstering reform,''
he said.
   Li's comments were made Tuesday and carried today by the
official Xinhua News Agency.
   The agency quoted him as saying soaring prices have ``made many
people uneasy'' and ``are affecting social security and people's
confidence in reform'' and that a period of stability is needed to
keep the reforms on track.
   Li told the ministers they must ``change their work style and
establish a strict responsibility system.'' The council and its
departments must take the lead in reducing construction of office
buildings, hotels and meeting halls, controlling consumer funds and
rooting out corruption in government.
   He told the State Planning Commision to take charge of cutting
investment, the Finance Ministry to control financial deficits and
purchasing by government groups, and the Materials Ministry to
punish government-backed companies profiteering in hard-to-get
materials.
   Last month, the Communist Party Central Committee outlined the
two-year period of belt-tightening to bring under control an
economy hit by overspending, serious shortages of raw materials and
consumer goods, and an inflation rate of at least 20 percent.
   Li's warning to the State Council comes after past failures by
the central government to reduce the frantic pace of construction
around the country that has far outstripped the nation's financial
capabilities.
   Capital investment has grown at a rate of 18.8 percent over the
past three years, a major factor in shortages and inflation that
threaten to disrupt senior leader Deng Xiaoping's 10-year program
of reducing the role of central planning and running the economy
based on market principles.

<HEAD>Lawyer Says Army's Ban on Homosexuals Unjustified</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army's exclusion of homosexuals from
service is unjustified and caters to ``private bigotry,'' a lawyer
for a discharged gay soldier told a federal appeals panel in a
historic discrimination case.
   But the government, defending the ban, said the Army had the
right to follow ``society's moral judgments'' against homosexuals.
   In a packed courtroom, an 11-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals heard more than an hour of arguments Wednesday in
reconsidering a decision by a smaller panel of the court that the
Army's ban on homosexuals was invalid.
   The 11-member panel did not issue any decision Wednesday.
   In its 2-1 decision, the three-judge panel declared that
homosexuals, as a historically persecuted group, were entitled to
the same strict constitutional protections against discrimination
given to racial and religious minorities. It was the first federal
appellate court to reach those conclusions.
   The lawyer for former soldier Perry Watkins of Tacoma, Wash.,
told the 11 judges Wednesday that the Army has no more
justification in barring homosexuals than it did in locking up
Japanese-Americans in World War II.
   ``There was no evidence to support the Army's assertion that all
Japanese-Americans were not loyal. There is no evidence to support
the Army's assertion that all homosexuals cannot effectively serve
the military,'' said James Lobsenz, an American Civil Liberties
Union lawyer.
   The Army's goal in excluding homosexuals, Lobsenz said, is ``to
cater to private bigotry.''
   But Justice Department attorney E. Roy Hawkens said the Army had
the right to follow ``society's moral judgments'' against
homosexuals.
   ``Congress has given the military broad authority to determine
what is appropriate conduct,'' he said. The confined military
environment ``provides the opportunity for (homosexual) conduct,
which is disruptive,'' Hawkens argued.
   Hawkens also contended that a 1986 U.S. Supreme Court ruling
upholding a Georgia anti-sodomy law had foreclosed broad
constitutional protections for homosexuals, an argument Lobsenz
disputed.
   In its February ruling, the three-judge appellate panel said the
Georgia sodomy case had only denied constitutional protection for
homosexual acts, and had not ruled out protections based on sexual
orientation.
   But the legal effect of that ruling was set aside when an
11-judge panel of the court agreed to hear the government's appeal.
   Watkins, now 40 and unemployed, told reporters he would be happy
to return to the Army if he won the case. A personnel sergeant with
high job evaluations, he was four years short of pension
eligibility when he was discharged in 1984.
   Lobsenz argued that the Army had made a binding promise to
Watkins by letting him re-enlist repeatedly after he informed
authorities of his homosexuality when he was drafted.
   During that time, Defense Department regulations prohibited the
enlistment or re-enlistment of homosexuals, but did not require
immediate discharge of a soldier whose homosexuality was discovered
while in the service, Lobsenz said.
   But the regulations were changed in March 1981 to require
discharge of homosexuals in service. Watkins applied for
reenlistment soon afterward and was rejected. He was discharged
after an initial federal court ruling in his favor was reversed.

   The daughter of a judge charged with conspiring
to fix Bess Myerson's lover's divorce said she tried to wreck her
car out of despondency during a 1{-year job search before the
former Miss America hired her.
   More than 100 spectators crowded into the courtroom Wednesday to
see Sukhreet Gabel testify for the prosecution at the conspiracy
trial of her mother, former state Supreme Court Justice Hortense
Gabel, 75; Miss Myerson, 64, and her lover, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso,
43.
   Ms. Gabel, 39, speaking about her 18-month job search, said she
was ``despondent, despairing and depressed'' until being hired in
August 1983 by Miss Myerson, the city's then-cultural affairs
commissioner.
   Prosecutors claim Miss Myerson circumvented normal city hiring
procedures to give Ms. Gabel the $19,000-a-year job as her special
assistant. In return, they charge Ms. Gabel's mother cut Capasso's
temporary alimony and child support payments to his estranged wife,
Nancy.
   Miss Myerson also is charged with obstruction of justice for
allegedly trying to get Ms. Gabel to lie to a federal grand jury.
   Calm and relaxed at first, Ms. Gabel appeared grim under
questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney David Lawrence as she
described her depression during her prolonged job hunt.
   Ms. Gabel said she dropped out of a doctoral program in
sociology at the University of Chicago in March 1982.
   A year later, still unemployed, Ms. Gabel said she deliberately
drove recklessly from New York to Chicago.
   ``I purposefully drove over the speed limit in miserable
weather,'' said Ms. Gabel, adding ``I drove in hopes I would meet
with an unfortunate accident.''
   Ms. Gabel said she later admitted herself to a hospital for
``evaluation and treatment for severe clinical depression'' and
stayed there for about seven weeks.
   Ms. Gabel said she met Miss Myerson at a dinner party at her
parents' Manhattan apartment in June 1983 and, unsolicited, Miss
Myerson offered to find her a job in her department a few weeks
later.
   Ms. Gabel said that she testified before the grand jury in March
and May of 1987, with immunity from prosecution, but called federal
prosecutors in June 1987 because she ``felt there were certain
things that had not come up'' before the grand jury.
   She said she waived her immunity from prosecution and agreed to
let the FBI tape her phone conversations with her lawyer.
   During that period, she said, she taped conversations with her
mother twice _ once when she called home, trying to locate the
lawyer and once ``completely inadvertently.''
   Ms. Gabel also said she took ``about four'' shopping bags of her
mother's documents to federal prosecutors.
   She said she had her mother's permission to show the documents
to lawyers but it was unclear from her testimony whether her mother
understood she was going to show them to prosecutors.
   Last summer, Mrs. Gabel's lawyer tried to suppress the evidence
gleaned from the documents, claiming it constituted an illegal
search, but U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan ruled against that
argument.

   A book and drawings by 19th century French poet
Charles Baudelaire sold at an auction for a total of $1.6 million,
the Druout auction house announced.
   The National Library bought the book ``My Naked Heart'' for
$350,000 at Salle Druout, the premier French art auction house.
   Several drawings with China ink and feather issued by Baudelaire
were sold to the Orsay Museum. They included ``Portrait de Jeanne
Duval,'' sold for $99,000, ``A Wife for Asselineau'' for $104,000
and another ``Jeanne Duval'' for $72,000.
   The items were sold from the Armand Godoy collection. Godoy was
a minor French poet but major collector who was born in Havana in
1880 and died in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1964.
   Baudelaire, 1821-1867, is known for his collection of poems
published as ``The Flowers Of Evil'' in 1857. His poetry, classical
in form, introduced symbolism by establishing symbolic
correspondence between sensory images.
   He was said to be obsessed by death and debauchery.

   A high-rise building fire that apparently began
in the offices of a music-video cable television company injured 17
firefighters and two other people early today, authorities said.
   Flames leapt from windows as about 150 firefighters battled the
blaze, which was reported at the 25-story Central Park Plaza
building in Manhattan shortly before 2 a.m. and under control at
3:18 a.m., said a Fire Department spokesman, John Mulligan.
   No one was in the office building at the time of the fire, he
said.
   Those injured included 17 firefighters and two members of Fire
Patrol, an insurance company group, Mulligan said. Most suffered
smoke inhalation and several were taken to area hospitals, he said.
   One firefighter suffered more serious injuries, apparently from
a fall as well as from smoke, and was taken to New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, Mulligan said. His condition was
not immediately available.
   Mulligan said the fire apparently began in offices occupied by a
company called VH1 or Video Hits 1, a producer of cable TV
programming. The other side of the floor is occupied by the MTV
(Music Television) Network.
   The Fire Department was investigating the blaze.

<TEXT>
   A grave discovered on a small, uninhabited atoll
in the Marshall Islands was believed to contain the remains of one
of five Hawaii fishermen who disappeared nearly 10 years ago,
authorities said.
   The grave and what remained of the men's 17-foot fiberglass
boat, the Sarah Joe, were found on Sibylla Island last month by a
U.S. National Marine Fisheries worker and an archaeologist studying
green turtles and sea birds, Coast Guard Capt. Jim Cushman said
Wednesday.
   Two forensics experts and a 27-member Coast Guard shore group
were sent to the island, located 2,054 nautical miles from Hawaii,
after officials in Honolulu were notified late last month, Cushman
said.
   ``It (the grave) was located some yards above the high water
mark,'' he said. ``It was a cairn of rocks with a crude cross on
top of it.''
   The partial remains, comprising about 60 percent of a skeleton,
including a lower jawbone, were found in the shallow grave, Cushman
said. A skull was not recovered, he said.
   A 2{-day search of the island, measuring about three miles by
less than half a mile, and nearby islands turned up no other human
artifacts, Cushman said.
   The island was described as uninhabitable, with no water or
vegetation, he said.
   The remains were transported last week to the Army's Central
Identification Laboratory in Honolulu, where an attempt to make a
positive identification will be made once medical records of the
five men are obtained, said Capt. Paul Bethke. It is possible the
remains might not be associated with the Sarah Joe, he said.
   The Sarah Joe was reported missing Feb. 11, 1979, after it
failed to return from a one-day fishing trip off Hana, Maui.
   A search for the boat was suspended after five days following a
56,000-square-mile search involving aircraft from the Coast Guard,
Navy, Marine Corps, civil air patrol and commercial and private
aircraft.
   Registration numbers on the boat's hull and the boat's
manufacturer's number were used to identify the Sarah Joe, said
Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler.

   Defense attorneys in the abruptly reduced
McMartin preschool molestation case welcomed the prosecution's
reduction of charges and said they will push for dismissal of 60 to
70 per cent of the allegations.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders, acting on a prosecution
request, on Wednesday dismissed 27 counts, nearly a third of the
charges, against Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin
Buckey.
   Those counts were based on claims of molestation made by three
child witnesses who failed to testify. Prosecutors also sought
dismissal of eight other charges linked to children who did testify.
   The prosecution said the absentees were too traumatized to come
to court. The defense contended the youngsters were purposely
excluded because their testimony was too bizarre to be believable.
   It was the second time in the tumultuous five-year history of
the McMartin case that prosecutors moved to substantially diminish
the scope of their charges.
   In 1986, after a two-year preliminary hearing, District Attorney
Ira Reiner moved to dismiss charges against five former teachers
originally arrested. He said evidence against them was ``incredibly
weak.''
   Instead of alleging that 41 children had been molested, the
prosecutors then scaled it down to 14 children. Wednesday's
alteration reduced it yet again to a total of 11 children. Only
nine of those testified at the trial.
   Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin said the eight pending
dismissal requests are based on ``a review of the evidence,''
indicating an apparent finding of insufficient proof.
   ``We conformed the pleadings to what was testified to in
court,'' he said.
   Defense attorney Danny Davis said he and co-counsel Dean Gits
will urge Pounders today to throw out more charges, claiming the
acts of molestation alleged by at least four children occurred
beyond the six-year statute of limitations for prosecution.
   ``If the statute of limitations argument holds, we'll see 60 to
70 per cent of the case (thrown) out,'' he said. ``We have a little
math game to play.''
   Pounders recessed the case until this afternoon in order to
study law on the subject.
   Buckey, 30, and his 61-year-old mother had been charged with 100
counts of molestation and conspiracy until Wednesday. Then
prosecutors unveiled a new complaint which contained only 65 counts
- 52 accusations against Buckey and 12 against Mrs. Buckey as well
as one joint charge of conspiracy.
   The move came after the last witnesses had testified in the
17-month prosecution case. The defense is scheduled to begin Monday.
   Ms. Rubin and Deputy District Attorney Roger Gunson asked
Pounders to approve substitution of the new complaint. He did not
immediately accept it but dismissed 27 of the original charges and
delayed ruling on the eight others until arguments are heard.
   Some children who had been toddlers when they attended the now
defunct McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach were pre-teen-agers
by the time they testified. Davis and Gits based their statute of
limitations challenge on the four oldest witnesses who they contend
were at the school before Raymond Buckey worked there.

<HEAD>Government Wins Key Vote to Scrap Secret Balloting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Ciriaco De Mita's coalition today won a
crucial vote to abolish most secret balloting in Parliament. De
Mita had threatened to resign if the measure failed.
   The Chamber of Deputies voted 323 to 58 in favor of the measure
during balloting that itself was secret. The main opposition
Communist Party said it would abstain.
   The proposal needed 316 votes to pass.
   The Christian Democrat leader staked his 6-month-old coalition
on the reform measure, which is aimed at eliminating one of the
principal causes of Italy's government instability.
   De Mita indicated last week that he would resign if the measure
was rejected. Socialist leader Bettino Craxi, whose party is the
second largest in the coalition after the Christian Democrats,
pushed hard for passage.
   The Senate will now take up the reform measure.
   Italy was one of the few Western democracies where most
parliamentary votes were secret and citizens had no certainty about
how their representatives voted on issues.
   The open vote is expected to strengthen the executive system and
create a more stable political climate in a country that has had a
succession of revoling-door governments. De Mita's is Italy's 48th
post-war government.
   Previously, governments have been plagued by lawmakers who used
the secret ballot to vote against their party line, particularly to
ensure passage of pet spending projects.
   De Mita's predecessor, Giovanni Goria, resigned after his
government was repeatedly defeated in attempts to trim Italy's
budget deficit, which now stands at $87 billion.
   The Communists, who had wanted to limit open voting to financial
measures, said they would abstain in an attempt to show up
government party deputies who vote against their own coalition.
   The five parties have 377 seats in the 630-seat Chamber of
Deputies.
   Under the chamber's reform, voting still will be secret when
dealing with special government bodies such as the organized crime
commission, when the vote involves a specific person, or when it
deals with such issues as abortion or personal liberties. Proposed
substantive changes to the constitution also be would excluded from
open ballots.
   But the majority of chamber votes, especially on financial
issues such as the annual budget, will be open.

<HEAD>U.S. Attorney Files Suit Over Pollution Of Everglades, Lake
Okeechobee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal suit charges that the state has allowed
water pollution to endanger and possibly destroy federal wildlife
areas in the Everglades and Lake Okeechobee.
   The Everglades system ``is an international environmental
treasure,'' said U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen. ``The degradation
over a number of years is a tragedy. They will be lost to future
generations.''
   The suit filed by Lehtinen Wednesday charges the state
Department of Environmental Regulation and the South Florida Water
Management District with allowing the operation of pumps without a
permit, failing to maintain water quality standards and violating
contracts to supply clean water to Everglades National Park.
   Dan Thompson, general counsel to the state Department of
Environmental Regulation, said he hadn't seen the suit, but added,
``We don't know what to make of it. We are strongly supportive of
trying to improve the environment.''
   The suit is an attempt to force the state and the water district
to end a nine-year standoff with dairy farmers and sugar-cane
growers, whose agricultural runoff is polluting rivers and canals
that feed the environmentally sensitive Everglades, which covers
much of South Florida.
   Thompson disputed Lehtinen's contention that his agency has the
legal authority to make farmers comply with water quality standards.
   Lake Okeechobee, at 700 square miles the nation's largest
fresh-water lake outside of the Great Lakes, has for years been
receiving pollution.
   Levels of phosphates and nitrates as much as 120 times higher
than natural levels are pouring into the area, producing
fish-killing algae blooms in the lake and changing the face of
Everglades National Park, according to park Superintendent Michael
Finley.
   ``This action is a pre-emptive strike _ what we are talking
about without action is ecological collapse,'' Finley said. He
described the damage already done as ``almost irreparable.''
   The park provides sanctuary to rare and endangered wildlife,
such as the Florida panther, Southern bald eagle, woodstork,
American crocodile and Cape Sable sparrow.
   Finley said the agricultural pollutants are slowly moving south
through rivers and canals in ``a cancer descending on the park''
and the adjoining Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge.
   Water district officials said that others _ including federal
agencies _ are part of the pollution problem.
   ``Both the state and federal governments were involved in the
development of Lake Okeechobee and the rest of South Florida's
surface water and drainage system,'' said John Wodraska, executive
director of the district, who is also named in the suit. He added
that the district is working on an anti-pollution plan.

<TEXT>
   A former farm hand accused of killing a
young cotton grower who had employed him turned himself in to
police, and friends and neighbors finished harvesting the farmer's
400-acre crop.
   Felix A. Williams, 29, of Gilliam was booked for second-degree
murder and held on a $150,000 bond for allegedly stabbing Tommy
Hutto, 26, of Belcher during an argument Monday.
   Williams also was booked with aggravated battery for allegedly
stabbing Hutto's wife, Terri, in the hand when she tried to
intervene, said Caddo Parish sheriff's investigators.
   Hutto's sister, Dianna White, said Williams took three checks
from Hutto's farm account book Friday, forged one, and cashed it.
She said Hutto closed the account as soon as he realized checks had
been stolen and then told the sheriff's office of the theft.
   Williams came to Hutto's home Monday when he realized
authorities were looking for him, and the fatal argument began,
White said.
   When word spread Tuesday about Hutto's death and the plight of
his widow, farmers and neighbors from the northwest Louisiana area
showed up to pick his 400 acres of cotton.
   ``Tommy was such a nice, hard-working man,'' farmer Tommy
Stinson of Belcher said Tuesday. ``Twenty-six years old, just
getting started. Several people quit picking their own cotton to do
this.''
   ``We didn't ask a soul,'' Stinson said. ``Everybody just sent
their men, machines and trailers, and the farmers pulled the cotton
to the gin.''
   They picked about 200 acres of Hutto's crop Tuesday, and came
back for the rest Wednesday.
   Retired farmer Dan Logan, now in his 80s, had especially fond
memories of Hutto. Hutto was only 19 when Logan contracted with him
to farm 100 acres of Logan's land.
   Progressive Farmer magazine featured a story of the tie between
Logan and Hutto in its July issue.
   ``In three years, he was successful _ had his tractors paid for
and was farming 400 acres,'' Logan said.

<HEAD>Givens Suffered Miscarriage in June, Doctor Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Robin Givens' doctor has released a
letter stating that she suffered a miscarriage in early June when
she was in her second month of pregnancy.
   But the letter from Dr. Sheldon Cherry, a Manhattan
gynecologist, did not address the question of whether Givens was
pregnant when she married world heavyweight boxing champ Mike Tyson
in February.
   Givens filed for divorce Oct. 7. However, Tyson is reportedly
considering seeking an annulment on the grounds that he married
Givens believing she was pregnant when she was not.
   The letter was released Wednesday through divorce lawyer Raoul
Felder, who is representing Givens.
   Felder had said Tuesday he would get a medical report from
Cherry that would prove Givens was pregnant when she married Tyson.
But on Wednesday, Felder denied that Givens had told Tyson that she
was pregnant before April.
   However, Tyson announced in Tokyo in March that Givens was
pregnant.
   Felder, a prominent Manhattan divorce lawyer, and his California
associate Neal Raymond Hersh said they were hired by Givens on
Sunday. She was originally represented by celebrity divorce lawyer
Marvin Mitchelson, who won the ``palimony'' case against the late
actor Lee Marvin.
   On Tuesday, Givens' lawyers said they will seek an out-of-court
property settlement but indicated there is still a chance the
marriage can be saved.
   Felder insisted that Givens is not a gold digger seeking Tyson's
assets, which are valued at about $40 million.
   Givens' divorce suit was filed in California because, Felder
said, the couple spent 70 percent of their eight-month marriage
there.
   California is a community property state, which means a
divorcing couple's assets are divided evenly. But Hersh said that
``a settlement out of court in a community property state can be
anything two people want.''

<TEXT>
   The National Geographic Society, after a
century of recording the world, is changing it.
   The society announced today that its world maps will be changed
to a new projection _ that is, a new way of looking at the Earth's
surface.
   For more than a half-century, the group's wall maps have been
produced in the Van der Grinten projection, an arrangement based on
a circle that gives the proper shape and size to land near the
Equator, but distorts land at the far north and south.
   In the future, the group will use the Robinson projection, based
on an ellipse, which is less distorted at the poles.
   ``It's a more realistic view of the world. We believe that its
balances of size and shape are the most reasonable for a general
reference map,'' said John B. Garver Jr., chief cartographer for
the society.
   Both projections are compromises, since any flat map distorts
some part of the Earth, mapmakers point out.
   In developing a map projection, cartographers try to find the
best compromise between the relative size and shape of continents,
their relationships with one another and the oceans separating them.
   The popular Mercator projection, for example, is based on a
rectangle and distorts northern and southern areas much more than
either the Robinson or Van der Grinten methods. Mercator has been
popular, however, because it can be used by navigators to plot
their travels as straight lines. No other map allows that.
   National Geographic maps, however, are not used as navigational
charts, thus that group strives to find better ways to portray the
world.
   ``A poorly chosen map projection can actually be harmful. We
tend to believe what we see, and when fundamental geographical
relationships such as shapes, sizes, directions and so on are badly
distorted, we are inclined to accept them as fact if we see them
that way on maps,'' the American Cartographic Society has commented.
   Robinson's map is considered superior to the Van der Grinten
because it is less distorted at areas distant from the Equator.
   For example, on Van der Grinten maps, Greenland appears to be
554 percent larger than it really is, while it is distorted by only
60 percent on the Robinson projection.
   On Van der Grinten maps, the Societ Union appears 223 percent
too large and the United States seems to be 68 percent bigger than
it really is. On the Robinson maps, the Soviet Union is just 18
percent larger than it should be, while the United States is 3
percent smaller.
   The Van der Grinten projection was adopted by the society in
1922. It was patented in 1904 by Alphons Van der Grinten, an
American engineer. Arthur H. Robinson, one of this nation's leading
cartographers, developed his projection while writing a textbook in
the 1950s, but says the ideas were first developed while working in
the map division of the Office of Strategic Services during World
War II.

   A massive electric power blackout
struck Manila and the main Philippine island of Luzon today in what
a spokesman for the electric company described as a systems
blackout.
   Power was restored to scattered areas of the city and in Baguio,
130 miles north of the capital, officials said. They said they
hoped to restore electricity to 60 percent of the island by Friday
morning.
   The power failure struck Manila about 5:20 p.m., causing massive
traffic jams at the height of the evening rush hour.
   ``It's a systems blackout, meaning no power plant is in
operation,'' Francisco de Leon, spokesman for the Manila Electric
Company, told radio station DZRH. ``We're trying to find out what
happened.''
   Officials said operations at Manila's Ninoy Aquino International
Airport were unaffected because emergency generators were used to
power runway and terminal lights as well as communications
equipment.
   But private television station GMA said there was no power at
Malacanang Palace, President Corazon Aquino's office compound.

<TEXT>
   The patriarch of a nomadic, backwoods
Texas family responsible for some of the nation's first serial
killings hanged himself with an extension cord in his prison cell,
authorities said.
   Sherman Ramon McCrary, 62, died Sunday at the Fremont
Correctional Facility, just an hour after he spoke with guards
making their rounds at the medium-security prison.
   ``I'm just old and tired and tired of doing time,'' he said in a
suicide note to the prison superintendent that was left in his cell.
   McCrary was serving a life sentence for the 1971 murder of a
Lakewood doughnut shop employee. He would have been eligible for
parole in 1997.
   He and his family were suspected in 21 other murders, mostly of
young women in a series of ``doughnut shop'' killings, primarily in
Colorado and Utah, nearly two decades ago. The slayings were
considered among the nation's first serial killings.
   Seventeen years ago, police from Florida to Oregon were battling
to get McCrary into their courtrooms on murder charges by the time
he was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of 20-year-old Leeora
Looney of Thornton.
   McCrary and his son-in-law, Carl Taylor, were serving time in
California's Folsom Prison in 1972 when Colorado authorities
implicated them in Looney's death. Looney, a waitress at a Lakewood
doughnut shop, was kidnapped, strangled, raped and shot in the head.
   Looney's death matched a string of rape-murders committed by the
family. Lakewood police Detective Joe Fanciulli said McCrary's wife
Carolyn, son Danny, and Taylor's wife Ginger all watched quietly as
Looney was raped and killed.
   He also recalls McCrary's and Taylor's attitudes when they
confessed. ``They'd consider killing a person the same way you and
I would consider stepping on an ant. They were classic sociopaths.
Absolutely no regard for human life,'' Fanciulli said.
   For the next five years, Fanciulli, now a Lakewood police
sergeant, made the Looney murder and the McCrary clan a full-time
job. He worked with other departments around the country and
co-authored a book on McCrary, ``Death Roads.''
   McCrary confessed to Lakewood police of murdering three women in
Texas, but the statements were not admissible under Texas law. Sgt.
A.L. Morris of the Potter County, Texas, sheriff's department
visited McCrary a year ago, hoping to persuade the 62-year-old to
confess again, but McCrary refused.
   Lou Hesse, superintendent of the Fremont Correctional Facility
where McCrary was housed, described him as a good inmate.
   ``He didn't have any disciplinary problems and had a good
relationship with the staff and inmates,'' Hesse said.

   City officials hope they pulled the plug on
much of the drug dealing at Venice Beach this week by disconnecting
25 pay telephones used almost exclusively by local traffickers.
   ``It was a significant problem,'' police Capt. Jan Carlson said.
``Some dealers tied up two to four phones at a time.''
   City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who represents Venice, asked
General Telephone Co. to remove all but six of the 31 phones along
a one-mile stretch of Ocean Front Walk after residents complained.
   ``I don't think drug dealers want to stand in line to make their
calls,'' said the councilwoman's spokesman, Rick Ruiz. ``And with
so few lines available, maybe they'll go away.''
   The tactic appears to be working, residents and merchants said.
   James Hoyt, who works at an Ocean Front Walk art gallery, said
the drug dealers are starting to disappear.
   ``You should see the looks on their faces,'' he said. ``It's
like, `Hey, where are the phones?' There's no place for anybody to
hang out anymore.''
   The phones were yanked out after a previous plan to shoo away
the push-button pushers didn't work.
   General Telephone had tried to placate residents and police last
month by replacing the regular phones with models equipped to allow
only outgoing calls.
   But it turned out that most dealers wear beepers and have little
need for incoming calls.
   Duane Nightingale, a GTE district manager, said the company went
along with the second plan because ``we wanted to be good
citizens,'' even though the phones made a lot of money.
   He foresees only one problem: that the thousands of Venice Beach
tourists will have a hard time finding a phone.
   ``People are going to want telephones and they're not going to
be there,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The head office of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International has denied any involvement in laundering
Colombian cocaine profits and pledged its full cooperation with
federal authorities.
   Representatives in BCCI's central offices in London said
Wednesday that the financial institution ``is wholly unaware of any
alleged violation and denies all allegations against it.''
   ``The bank ... will do everything in its power to assist the
concerned authorities in resolving these serious allegations,''
bank managers said in a statement.
   U.S. Customs Service agents announced Tuesday that
Luxembourg-based BCCI Holding, two of its subsidiaries and nine
bank officials were among 85 accused of participating in an
intercontinental ring which allegedly laundered $32 million in
profits for the Colombian cocaine trade.
   Federal agents alleged that $14 million was funneled through
BCCI.
   ``The amount of $14 million hardly suggests that it could have
helped a bank of $20 billion to enhance its financial position,''
the London BCCI office said.
   BCCI, founded in 1972, has 14,000 employees and reserves of $1.5
billion, and operates in 73 countries.
   Forty-one suspects have been taken into custody. Undercover
agents posed as financiers during a two-year sting that involved
operations in 10 cities in the United States, London and Paris.
   During hearings for defendants arrested in Tampa, prosecutors
said Syed Aftrab Hussain, BCCI's operations officer in Panama,
showed agents how to use BCCI to better service drug clients.
   Prosecutors allege that Hussain was part of a group of BCCI
officials who courted drug accounts. They said the group was led by
Amjad Awan, 41, of Coral Gables, assistant director of BCCI's Latin
American Division.
   Comments by prosecutors during Awan's hearing Tuesday raised
questions about the Colombian drug trade's ties to Panama's
military ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Jackowski said that Awan, who
managed BCCI's Panamanian office between 1981 and 1985, was a
witness last February in a U.S. Senate subcommittee investigation.
   Noriega's former political adviser and top aide Jose Blandon
reportedly testified that Noriega sold his influence to Colombian
cocaine cartels and that some of the money got to him through BCCI.

   The government today lost its 2{-year battle to
stop three London newspapers from publishing excerpts from
``Spycatcher,'' the memoirs of former intelligence agent Peter
Wright.
   For the press, the ruling was a victory after prolonged legal
wrangling that turned ``Spycatcher'' _ a best-seller in the United
States and Australia _ into a test case of freedom of speech versus
national security.
   The five judges of the Law Lords, Britain's highest court,
unanimously upheld a ruling by the Court of Appeal that The
Guardian, The Observer and The Sunday Times could publish the
excerpts.
   The judges lifted temporary injunctions barring publication, but
only after criticizing Wright for violating the lifetime secrecy
oath he took when he joined MI5, Britain's counterintelligence
agency.
   They said he ``flagrantly'' breached his oath and was ``as
guilty of treachery as heinous as that of the spies'' he wrote
about. Only the fact that the book was so widely available
elsewhere convinced them to allow publication in Britain, they said.
   Publishers William Heinemann said they will notify the
government they plan to publish 200,000 paperback copies of the
book in Britain. The publishers earlier agreed to provide such
notice to allow the government time to intervene.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said the government felt vindicated
by the decision because it upheld its view that former security
agents remain bound by their secrecy oath.
   But opposition Labor Party spokesman Ray Hattersley said the
government ``made Britain a laughingstock from America to
Australia'' by pursuing the case.
   Lord Keith of the Court of Appeal said he voted for publication
primarily because the book is available outside Britain and its
contents are widely known.
   ``It is absolutely terrific,'' said Peter Preston, editor of the
Guardian. ``This has gone on for 2{ years and been heard by 23
judges. It is smashing to win hands down at the end.''
   The government estimates its legal battle has cost $994,750, but
legal experts say it could be as much as $5 million.
   The book describes Wright's experiences during 20 years with
MI5, Britain's counterintelligence agency. Among other things,
Wright claims that the late Roger Hollis, an MI5 chief, was a
double agent working for the Soviets _ a claim the government says
has never been substantiated.
   It alleges the security service eavesdropped on foreign
embassies, bungled operations, stole documents, plotted to
assassinate Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and to
destabilize Harold Wilson's Labor Party government in the 1970s.
   Wright retired to Tasmania, Australia, in 1976 and could not
immediately be reached for comment. An attempt by the British
government to suppress publication in Australia failed, and it has
been published there.
   Wright, 73, has said that his book, which has sold 1.4 million
copies in 40 countries, revealed nothing that could jeopardize
national security.
   The British government maintains it has pursued its case to
uphold the principle that former intelligence agents are bound by
their lifetime oath of secrecy and to prevent similar books from
being published.

<HEAD>EPA Finds Way Around Clause Outlawing Some Food Additives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says it
will define a one-in-million chance of getting cancer as
effectively zero, permitting it to sometimes disregard a legal
provision that outlaws cancer-causing additives in food.
   Paradoxically, the agency says this could reduce the pesticide
threat in the diet by speeding the introduction of pesticides that
are weak causes of cancer but safer than those being used today.
   Though EPA doesn't regulate most food additives, it does
regulate pesticides. Federal law defines as an additive any
pesticide residue on food that is concentrated by processing.
   A cancer-causing residue may be permitted on raw food if EPA
finds that the benefit of pesticide use outweighs the risk.
   When the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1958 was passed,
it included a provision, called the ``Delaney clause'' after the
bill's main sponsor, then-Rep. James J. Delaney, D-N.Y., banning
any food additive shown to cause cancer in man or animal.
   Up to now, EPA has interpreted the clause to require it to
refuse to establish a permitted residue level for new
cancer-causing pesticides that become more concentrated in
processing, and to refuse to issue pesticide licenses for such new
chemicals.
   But in the early 1980s the agency became aware that new data
gathered in its massive review of old pesticides licensed under
looser standards would forbid the licensing of those chemicals if
they were to come up again.
   Jack Moore, the agency's acting deputy administrator, admitted
to reporters Wednesday that the agency was reluctant to face the
implications of the new data at first.
   Even today, a ``zero risk (policy) is totally infeasible as we
sit here ... There would be so many pesticide uses being curtailed
we'd cause dramatic and deep disruption in the food supply,'' Moore
said.
   Moore said the policy change will permit EPA to decide the fate
of 73 currently licensed old pesticides for which there is some
evidence of cancer-causing power. At least 50 concentrate residues
in processing.
   There are at least a dozen chemicals known to be weak causes of
cancer that have been proposed for new or additional uses on food,
though not all have current license applications pending, he said.
   ``If you don't let (the new chemical) on the market there'll
never be an opportunity'' to retire the old one, either through
regulations or competitive pressure, Moore said.
   Janet Hathaway, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, and Jay Feldman, coordinator of the National Campaign
Against the Misuse of Pesticides, both said EPA was indeed obliged
to use the Delaney clause against old pesticides if new data
justified it.
   ``We are horrified,'' said Ms. Hathaway, who accused EPA of
``completely gutting the Delaney clause.''
   ``You need legislation if you're going to go this route,'' she
said. In fact, her group supported in principle an unsuccessful
bill this summer aimed at similar changes in the law.
   Feldman said EPA's new policy failed to consider the cumulative
risk from all pesticides. ``We're talking about significant
exposure,'' he said.
   If a pesticide has a better than one-in-a-million chance of
causing cancer, EPA will not permit any residue in processed food.
If the only residue is on the raw crop, EPA will apply risk-benefit
calculations, giving greater weight to benefits to the food supply
as a whole than it did in the past.
   If the maximum risk of cancer is one in a million or less, the
agency will treat the chemical as if it were not a cause of cancer.
   The change in EPA policy is in line with one of the
recommendations of a National Academy of Sciences panel last year.
   Generally, federal agencies are permitted to disregard
congressional directives that lead to results counter to what a
statute intended. In specific cases, the courts may rule against
them, as happened to the Food and Drug Administration when it tried
to apply the same one-in-a-million standard to food coloring.
   The federal appeals court that decided the case noted that its
decision might not apply to pesticides.

   Hijackers clutched grenades and a
gun and randomly battered terrified passengers after seizing a TWA
airliner in 1985, a former American hostage testified.
   Choking back tears, Robert G. Brown also told a court that he
feared his family believed that he was the U.S. Marine reported
slain during the ordeal.
   ``I was afraid that my wife and children thought I was dead,''
said Brown.
   Brown testified Wednesday during the trial of Mohammed Ali
Hamadi, who is charged with air piracy and murder in the June 14,
1985 hijacking. The Athens-to-Rome flight was diverted to Beirut
and 39 Americans were held for 17 days.
   U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was shot by the hijackers and
tossed out on the runway in Beirut to die. The hijackers had
screamed ``Marine'' at Stethem while he was beaten and before he
was shot, witnesses have said.
   The trial, in a heavily guarded courtroom in a Frankfurt prison,
recessed today until Oct. 21.
   Brown, 45, described the first minutes after the jetliner was
seized.
   ``One man had a pistol in one hand and a grenade in the other,''
Brown said referring to Hassan Ezzeddine, Hamadi's alleged
accomplice.
   ``The other man (Hamadi) had a hand grenade in has hand. I saw a
(grenade) pin on the floor of the plane, which to be honest with
you, frightened the hell out of me.''
   He said the hijackers ran through the plane, striking passengers.
   ``I was able to see numerous times the brutality that both of
the hijackers inflicted on the passengers. They were hitting them
right and left.''
   Brown said that he was later taken off the plane in Beirut and
held by other captors as the hostage ordeal continued. He said he
was first taken to a ``slum house where we were interrogated.
   ``We were taken later to an underground prison. For the first
seven days we did not brush our teeth, or wash or change our
clothes. There were no newspapers and no news.''
   Brown said the hostages were moved again to a third location
where they were allowed to wash and read magazines. The husky
ex-Marine said it was then that he believed his family thought he,
not Stethem, had been slain.
   ``At this time I realized that my wife had been told I was
killed because I had been a Marine and it was published that a
Marine had been killed,'' he said.
   Hamadi has admitted taking part in the hijacking, but denies
shooting Stethem.
   Brown, who said he worked for a medical equipment company, was
not asked by the court to reveal his residence under court
guidelines for the protection of witnesses.
   At the time of the hijacking, Brown listed his residence as
Stow, Mass.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in 1987 after customs
officials found explosives in his luggage.

<HEAD>Latest Central Library Fire Could Delay Building's 1992 Reopening</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire caused by renovation work at the
arson-ravaged Central Library could delay the building's reopening
if historic murals in the lobby were damaged, officials said.
   ``We're concerned _ terrified as a matter of fact _ that there
is enough smoke damage to put another film on the murals,'' city
librarian Wyman Jones said Wednesday.
   Construction materials in the basement were ignited Tuesday by
hot scraps that had been cut by a welding torch, said fire
Inspector Ed Reed.
   Except for the murals, which were recently cleaned at a cost of
$400,000, all of the library's books and other valuables had been
removed.
   If the murals _ painted in 1920 and depicting California's
history _ need another cleaning, the library's scheduled reopening
date in 1992 could be delayed, Jones said.
   The fire broke out as the 62-year-old library was undergoing a
$152 million renovation following two disastrous arson fires that
destroyed hundreds of thousands of books in 1986.
   The renovation had not reached the point of installing fire
sprinklers, fire and library officials said.
   The first of the two arson blazes that gutted the library was
set April 29, 1986, and spread quickly, destroying 375,000 books
and causing $22 million in damage. A second fire struck on Sept. 3,
1986, and destroyed 25,000 books.

   Patrick J. Kennedy, the son of Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, spent $66 for every vote he
received in his successful bid for a state House seat, campaign
finance reports show.
   Kennedy spent $87,694 to unseat five-term Rep. John M.
Skeffington Jr. in last month's Democratic primary. All but $5,904
of that sum came from him or his family, according to the report
filed Wednesday with the state Board of Elections.
   Skeffington has not yet filed his report. Robert Doorley,
Skeffington's campaign chairman, said the incumbent spent between
$38,000 and $40,000.
   Kennedy, 21, received 1,324 votes to 1,009 for Skeffington in
the district on the west side of Providence. He does not have a
Republican opponent in November.
   Kennedy's pay as a state representative will be $5 per
legislative day, up to a maximum of $300.
   ``All of our money is there and it's all out in the open,''
Kennedy said. ``I make no secret of the fact that I have been given
a lot. I hope I can be a force for good at the Statehouse.''
   Kennedy said the big spending was necessary to counter
Skeffington's support from Democratic Party leaders and a
last-minute advertising campaign supporting Skeffington that was
paid for by the National Rifle Association.
   He said $15,000 of the sum went to lawyers who pursued
challenges to the registrations of about 170 voters.

   Bishop Frank Rodimer says five nuns who
remain barricaded in a monastery to protest changes in their way of
life are causing a scandal in the Roman Catholic Church.
   Rodimer, the head of the Paterson diocese, said Wednesday that
the nuns could be relieved of their vows if the standoff at the
Morris Township monastery does not end.
   ``It's a possibility,'' he said at a news conference. ``But I
don't foresee that. ... They've broken the vow of obedience, and I
suppose it's a scandal in that sense.
   ``My hope is that they'd be able to come around and live
together in peace.''
   The Vatican has asked the Rev. Kevin Culligan of Milwaukee, a
Carmelite priest, to help resolve the dispute. The nuns also belong
to the Carmelite order.
   Rodimer denied claims by the nuns that he was trying to close
the Monastery of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel, but
added that their actions could end the Carmelite order in the
diocese.
   The nuns barricaded themselves in the monastery's infirmary on
Oct. 4 in protest of changes including the introduction of sweets,
radio and television.
   ``Very profound issues,'' Rodimer said sarcastically.
   He said nuns didn't have electricity or telephones in the 16th
century, but that the protesters never objected to those additions
to the order's life.
   ``For all the sisters to remain together and remain seriously at
odds with one another would be a course of action that could,
potentially, lead to the closing of the Carmel, an outcome that no
one wants,'' he said. ``People cannot pray together unless they can
live together in charity.''
   The protesters have said that all 13 nuns at the monastery
should strictly adhere to the traditional Carmelite life, which
stresses prayer and silence.
   One of the barricaded nuns, Sister John of the Cross, has said
the nuns were upset after Rodimer took the ``highly irregular''
move of putting Mother Teresa Hewitt in charge of the monastery
without consulting the nuns who live there. She said the nuns are
supposed to elect their own prioress.
   Culligan is to meet with the prioress and all of the nuns
individually to hear their views on the dispute, Rodimer said. The
bishop said he will make a final decision on how to resolve the
matter.

<HEAD>Moslems And Christians Appoint Rival Security Chiefs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Moslem government today appointed a
Shiite Moslem as acting chief of security today after rejecting a
Christian appointed by the rival Christian government.
   Police Superintendent Assad Taqsh was named acting chief of
security by Abdulla Rassi, interior minister in interim Prime
Minister Salim Hoss' Syrian-backed Cabinet, which is predominantly
Moslem.
   A Moslem politician, speaking on condition of anonymity,
described the naming of two rival security chiefs as the ``most
dangerous step in the direction of formalizing Lebanon's
partition.''
   The country's de facto partition into sectarian cantons followed
Parliament's failure to elect a successor to President Amin
Gemayel, whose six-year term expired Sept. 22.
   The Hoss government rejected the appointment of Police Brig.
Gen. Nadim lteif to the post of security chief by army commander
Gen. Michel Aoun and his Cabinet, the rival Christian government.
   Aoun on Tuesday appointed lteif, a Greek Catholic, chief of
security after dismissing Jamil Nimeh, a Gemayel supporter.
   The double appointment to the position of chief of security, who
issues passports in Lebanon, may present a legal problem.
   ``Who would issue the Lebanese passports now? Lteif or Taqsh?''
asked the Moslem politician.
   ``The Moslems would presumably have passports signed by Taqsh
and the Christians' passports would be issued by lteif. I wonder
which of the two passports would be accepted by foreign
countries?'' he said.
   Taqsh's appointement came shortly after U.S. Ambassador John
McCarthy held separate talks in west Beirut with Hoss and
Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Moslem, on ways to
break the political deadlock.
   Parliament has failed three times since Aug. 18 to elect a
successor to Gemayel after Christian deputies boycotted sessions to
prevent the needed 51-member quorum from gathering. The Christians
wanted to block the election of a pro-Syrian candidate as president.
   Gemayel appointed Aoun to head an interim military government
pending the election of a president. Syrian-backed Moslem leaders
rejected Aoun's appointment and declared support for Hoss, who had
been premier under Gemayel.

<HEAD>Text Of Citation For Nobel Literature Winner Naguib Mahfouz</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the citation
from the Swedish Academy, which awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in
literature to Egyptian writer Naguib Mahfouz on Thursday:
   Nobel Prize winner in literature, 1988: Naguib Mahfouz, who,
through works rich in nuance _ now clear-sightedly realistic, now
evocatively ambiguous _ has formed an Arabian narrative art that
applies to all mankind.
   Mahfouz's great and decisive achievement is as the writer of
novels and short stories. His production has meant a powerful
upswing for the novel as a genre and for the deveopment of the
literary language in Arabic-speaking cultural circles. The range is
however greater than that. His work speaks to us all.
   Mahfouz really made his name with the big Trilogy (1956-57). In
the center is a family and its vicissitudes from the end of the
1910s to the middle of the 1940s. The series of novels has
autobiographical elements. The depiction of individuals relates
very clearly to intellectual, social and political conditions. On
the whole through his writings Mahfouz has exerted considerable
influence in his country.
   The theme of the unusual novel ``Children of Gebelawi'' (1959)
is man's everlasting search for spiritual values. ... Different
norm systems are confronted with tension in the description of the
conflict between good and evil.
   ``A Houseboat on the Nile'' (1966 _ not yet translated into
English) is an example of Mahfouz's impressive novellas. Here
metaphysical conversations are carried on in the borderland between
reality and illusion. At the same time the text forms itself into a
comment on the intellectual climate in the country.
   In the volume of selected stories ``God's World'' (1973) ... the
artistic treatment of the existential questions is forceful and the
formal solutions often striking.
   There has been a tendency to divide Mahfouz's writings into a
number of periods, e.g. a historical, a realistic and a
metaphysical-mystical. Naturally this has not happened without
reason. However, the illumination throughout of human life in
general should also be emphasized.

   Scientific tests on the Shroud of Turin
indicate it is no more than 728 years old and cannot be the burial
cloth of Christ, the archbishop of Turin announced today.
   But the shroud is not necessarily a fake, the archbishop's
scientific adviser said.
   Scientists are ``95 percent'' sure of the accuracy of tests
dating the shroud between 1260 and 1390, the archbishop, Cardinal
Anastasio Ballestrero, told a news conference. ``I see no reason
for the church to put these results in doubt,'' he said.
   Luigi Gonella, the scientific adviser, bristled at suggestions
the shroud is a forgery.
   ``A forgery is for the specific purpose of deceiving people. It
could be possible, but there is no proof,'' Gonella said. ``This
could be a medieval icon. We don't even know how it was made.''
   The shroud _ 14 feet, 3 inches long and 3 feet, 7 inches wide _
bears a faint yellowish negative image of the front and back of a
man with a thorn mark on the head, flogging lacerations on the
back, bruises on his shoulders and knees, and wounds in the side,
wrists and feet.
   For centuries it has been revered by some as the burial cloth of
Jesus and dismissed by others as a clever forgery.
   Ballestrero repeated that the Roman Catholic Church never
claimed the shroud to be a holy relic. But he and Gonella said the
image on the shroud has great symbolic importance.
   Ballestrero said he personally saw the shroud as the
``revelation of the face and the body of Christ.''
   ``The church believes in the image and not in the history
because this image of Jesus Christ in fact is very interesting and
the people believe deeply in Jesus,'' Ballestrero said.
   News reports for weeks have said the carbon-14 tests dated the
shroud to the Middle Ages and therefore it could not be Christ's
burial cloth.
   Gonella today attacked those reports, especially in the British
press, and said they made the ``unfair insinuation that the church
was afraid of science and was trying to hide (the) results.''
   He added that ``the church does not fear science. It agreed to
do these tests. The results confirm that the shroud is medieval. As
for history, it is a date, but for the faith, the shroud is the
face of Christ and those things don't change.''
   Laboratories at the University of Arizona, the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology at the University of Zurich and Oxford
University conducted the carbon-14 tests on postage-stamp size
pieces of linen snipped from the shroud in April.
   The tests give a scientific basis for the age of the shroud but
do nothing to solve the enduring riddle of how the image was
created.
   American scientists who subjected the linen to its most rigorous
chemical, computer and photographic analysis concluded in 1981 that
it was ``a real human form of a whipped and crucified man and not
the product of an artist.''
   They speculated it resulted from chemical changes in the linen
while it was in contact with a body. Such changes could be
duplicated to a degree in the laboratory, they said. But they added
no method could adequately explain the shroud's image.
   The carbon-14 tests were supposed to be conducted as a blind
study. Each of the three laboratories was given one piece of the
shroud and one piece of linen with a known date. The labs were not
to know which was which, but the distinctive herringbone pattern of
the shroud could have given its sample away.
   Scientists have said the triple carbon dating should reveal the
age of the cloth within a 200-year range.
   The first mention of the possible existence of Christ's shroud
came from French crusader Robert of Clari, who wrote that he saw it
in 1203 in the imperial palace in Constantinople.
   But the first actual records of the Shroud of Turin trace it
only to Lirey, France in 1354.
   The shroud was bequeathed to the pope by former King Umberto II
of Italy upon his death in 1983.

<HEAD>Hotel Owner Says He Will Sell Nazi Material</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hotel owner with an extensive collection of
Nazi memorabilia who came under fire for hosting Hitler birthday
parties says he has painted over a controversial mural and will
sell the artifacts, rather than put them on display.
   Imperial Palace owner Ralph Engelstad also said he will sell his
collection of World War II German vehicles instead of opening a
wing of his automobile exhibit for them.
   Engelstad reported his decision to get rid of his
multimillion-dollar collection in a letter Tuesday to the Jewish
Federation of Las Vegas. He had met with with Mayor Ron Lurie the
day before.
   ``I now feel I have done what I can and apologized for what I
cannot do,'' Engelstad said in the letter.
   Alan Hilburg, a Dallas public relations specialist in ``crisis
communication'' who is representing Engelstad, said, ``I think what
he has tried to do is arrive at a solution that meets the needs of
the entire Las Vegas community and will allow Las Vegas to get back
to business.''
   Last week, Engelstad apologized for the Hitler parties he held
for employees, saying they were ``stupid, insensitive and held in
bad taste.'' He denied that he had any sympathy for Hitler or Nazi
ideology.
   He said then that he was still considering opening his private
``war room'' collection of Nazi and Axis memorabilia to the public.
   ``Over the weekend he spent quite a bit of time wrestling with
this and decided it (selling the collection) was the best thing to
do,'' said Hilburg.
   The resort owner has already had the mural in the ``war room''
painted over and is making plans to get rid of his collection, the
spokesman said.
   In his letter to the Jewish Federation, Engelstad complained of
``a degree of unfair treatment'' by the media, but acknowledged he
had not been successful in convincing the community that his
apology was ``heartfelt and sincere.''
   ``I realize that what was missing in my apology was an
acknowledgement of the specific hurt and pain felt by the Jewish
community over this issue,'' he said. ``And I am prepared to
publicly do that.''
   Engelstad also is under investigation by the state Gaming
Control Board for allegations that he ordered the destruction of
Imperial Palace security records and other documents that have
become a point of contention in a civil lawsuit.
   Gaming agents recently inspected the ``war room'' as part of an
investigation into Engelstad's suitability as a casino owner. Last
week, they found a printing plate at the hotel used to make
hundreds of bumper stickers bearing the words ``Hitler Was Right.''
The board wants to know if Engelstad ordered the bumper stickers
printed.

<HEAD>Tories Promise More Tax Cuts, Lower Inflation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIGHTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury chief Nigel Lawson today
promised more tax cuts ``when it is prudent'' and forecast a drop
in inflation next year.
   But in his address to his Conservative Party's annual
convention, he warned that interest rates, now at 12 percent, would
remain high for ``quite a while.''
   The third day of the gathering in this English seaside town was
highlighted by a promise of more cash for nurses _ whose pay
dispute is one of the most serious now facing the government _ and
birthday greetings to Prime Minister and party leader Margaret
Thatcher, who turned 63 today.
   Lawson, who is chancellor of the exchequer, the equivalent of
treasury secretary, said inflation, now running at 5.7 percent,
would begin to drop next year.
   He also pledged to cut the basic income tax rate, now 25
percent, to 20 percent ``as and when it is prudent.'' But interest
rates, which had been raised to dampen a consumer spending boom
brought on partly by Lawson's previous tax cuts, would remain high
``for quite a while,'' he said.
   Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke delighted delegates with an
offer of $235.45 million to boost nurses' pay and spare the
nation's health authorities from having to cut back services.
   This year, many nurses joined in an unprecedented one-day strike
for higher pay, and because they enjoy considerable public
sympathy, their demands have put Mrs. Thatcher's budget-cutting
strategies to a severe test.
   Clarke denied he had caved in to the nurses, saying they were
``worth every penny of it.''
   Hundreds of delegates rose to their feet and started singing
``Happy Birthday'' as Mrs. Thatcher arrived in the convention hall.
   Mrs. Thatcher looked genuinely surprised as an electronic organ
blared out the song and party members shouted out good wishes.
   Dressed in a blue checked suit, she smiled broadly when Tory
Party senior vice-chairman Sir Stanley Odell handed her a large
bouquet.

   Teachers in this lower Michigan district
returned to work today after negotiators agreed on binding
arbitration to end a strike that affected 3,000 students.
   A state-appointed fact-finder is expected to issue a ruling to
settle the strike by the 150 teachers within 30 days, said Tom
Parmeter, spokesman for the Hartland Education Association, which
represents the teachers in the Livingston County district, halfway
between Detroit and Lansing.
   Teachers are seeking a 7.9 percent pay increase while the
district offered 6 percent, Parmeter said Wednesday.
   A teacher with a master's degree and 11 years experience makes
$34,000, Parmeter said.
   Strikes by teachers continued today in seven districts in
Arkansas, Illinois and Pennsylvania, affecting 32,000 students.

   Authorities in the southern republic
of Montenegro today banned street rallies after demonstrations by
nationalists escalated into anti-government protests.
   Belgrade newspapers said three Communist Party leaders probably
would be ousted during a meeting of party leaders Monday. The
bosses have promised a shake-up aimed at ending the economic crisis
and ethnic conflict.
   The ruling Politburo sharply denounced attacks on the late
President Josip Broz Tito. Some prominent intellectuals blame Tito
for the problems.
   Inflation stands at 217 percent, unemployment at 15 percent and
the foreign debt is $21 billion. Living standards have fallen by at
least one-half since 1980, according to official figures.
   In addition, ethnic Serbs have been agitating for more Serbian
control over the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vovodjina,
alleging harassment by the majority ethnic Albanians.
   Some of the biggest rallies have occurred in the southern
republic of Montenegro.
   A statement from the republic's ruling Politburo urged citizens
to stay away from ``scheduled mass demonstrations'' this weekend.
The statement was carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency.
   Tanjug also quoted Marko Orlandic, a Montenegrin member of the
national Poliburo, as saying: ``The state presidency of Montenegro
has introduced urgent measures to stop all gatherings which could
jeopardize the security situation, property and lives of citizens.''
   In Montenegro's capital, Titograd, numerous riot police were on
patrol this week.
   Security has been stepped up among police, army and civilian
defense units in at least some regions of the country, according to
sources who asked not to be identified.
   Belgrade dailies reported at least two scheduled nationalist
rallies were called off in Serbia and Montenegro this week. This
appeared to be a reaction to a warning from President Raif
Dizdarevic on Sunday that further unrest could provoke unspecified
emergency measures.
   The Communist leadership is meeting in each of Yugoslavia's six
republics and two autonomous provinces this week to prepare for
Monday's Central Committee session in Belgrade.
   The announcement of the probable ouster of three top leaders
from the party's Central Committee was made during a meeting of top
Communists in the northern republic of Slovenia on Wednesday,
Belgrade newspapers reported today.
   The reports identified the three _ all from the republic of
Slovenia _ as Stane Dolanc, currently Yugoslavia's vice president,
Marjan Orozen, head of the official trade unions, and Janez
Zemljaric, one of the nation's two vice premiers.
   They were the first people named as being likely to be removed
during the meeting of the 165-member Central Committee.
   Stefan Korosec, a national Central Committee secretary, was
quoted in Belgrade newspapers as telling the Slovene Central
Committee that the three men ``are among those who are likely to be
replaced.''
   He added that several other leaders from Yugoslavia's other
republics would lose their posts but said he did not want to name
them.
   Dolanc has frequently been named in recent weeks as a leader
Serbian nationalists wanted to see fall. The Serbs allege Dolanc
was not tough enough on ethnic Albanians after racial riots erupted
in Serbia's province of Kosovo in 1981, when Dolanc was interior
minister.
   Zemljaric has been involved in economic policy for much of the
1980s, when inflation spiraled out of control.
   As head of the trade unions, Orozen is also a target for
criticism amid growing worker unrest over austerity measures that
are slashing wages but failing to stem price hikes.
   On Wednesday, Slovene Communist leader Milan Kucan criticized
Serbian Communists and nationalist rallies.
   The attack followed a strong defense of the rallies Tuesday by
Serbian Communist Party leader Slobodan Milosevic, who has support
among the hundreds of thousands who have attended the gatherings.
   In Belgrade, Ivica Racan, a member of the Politburo from the
republic of Croatia, today said attacks on Tito amount to attacks
on Yugoslavia's political system. He spoke during a meeting of
party leaders.
   A 19-member Committee in Defense of Intellectual Freedoms, in a
statement to the Yugoslav leadership June 27, said Tito was to
blame for creating an undemocratic, repressive political system
``which has thwarted the progressive development of the society.''
   Tito, who died in 1980 after ruling for 35 years, is revered by
Yugoslav authorities and public criticism of his policies can be
prosecuted.
   ``There can be no way out of the present economic, political and
moral crisis affecting Yugoslav society without a thorough critical
evaluation of past Yugoslav policies,'' the statement said.
   According to Tanjug, Racan said several government organizations
and officials have denounced the committee's statement, calling for
political or even criminal responsibility of the authors.

   A small plane crashed on a
fog-shrouded hill as the pilot prepared for an instrument landing,
authorities said, and all three people aboard were killed.
   The final communication between the single-engine Piper Cherokee
and the Santa Maria Airport tower came at 10:06 a.m. Wednesday when
the pilot asked for routine landing instructions, said Federal
Aviation Administration spokesman Fred O'Donnell.
   The plane was found nearly an hour later on a hill called
Solomon Peak, about five miles southeast of the airport and 150
miles northwest of Los Angeles. There were no survivors, said Santa
Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Keith Collum.
   The pilot was identified as Theodore Talbot Culpepper, 67, of
San Luis Rey Downs, and the passengers were identified as Raymond
Kawano, 50, of Oceanside, and Ronald W. Fisk, 33, of San Diego,
said Deputy L. Hess of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's
Department.
   ``The two passengers had hired Culpepper to fly them to Santa
Maria on agricultural business,'' Hess said.

   The Chrysler Museum will get a $1.6 million
endowment and the majority of a family trust fund from the estate
of Walter P. Chrysler Jr., but a major portion of the art works now
on loan to the museum will go to a nephew, according to a museum
official.
   David Steadman, director of the museum, disclosed the provisions
of the will Wednesday. Of the 785 works on loan, 768 will go to
Jack Forker Chrysler Jr., a nephew and ``the only male of his
generation bearing the Chrysler name,'' Steadman said.
   Steadman said, however, only between 10 percent and 15 percent
of the works going to Jack Chrysler have ever been displayed at the
museum. He said the majority of the Chrysler collection, including
the most valuable and important works, already were the property of
the museum through previous Chrysler donations.
   The museum will get ownership of the remaining 17 American and
European paintings on loan, plus the endowment and 76 percent of
the family trust fund, thought to be less than $10 million,
Steadman said. That fund was established by Walter P. Chrysler Sr.,
founder of the Chrysler Corp.
   Steadman declined to put a value on the 17 new paintings,
including Albert Bierstadt's ``The Emerald Pool,'' Walt Kuhn's
``American Beauty,'' Robert Motherwell's ``The Golden Fleece'' and
John Hoppner's ``Portrait of Mrs. John Farthing.''
   Chrysler, 79, who died last month, had not discussed the
provisions of his will with the museum, Steadman said.
   ``I never had a clue about anything about Walter,'' he said.
``He was a very complex individual.''
   Steadman estimated that since 1971 Chrysler had donated about
$100 million worth of art to the museum.

<HEAD>Leaders: Women's Civil Rights Roles Will Help With Future
Strategies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The status of women remains a critical issue for
the civil rights movement, says Coretta Scott King.
   ``Human survival in the future will depend on the political
empowerment of women,'' the widow of Martin Luther King Jr. said
Wednesday at the opening of a a four-day conference on ``Women in
the Civil Rights Movement.''
   ``We women stood in the background and held things up, to keep
them going, over the years,'' Mrs. King said. ``We have a
tremendous job to do each time we communicate with younger people
to help them understand what the conditions were so that they can
appreciate the progress that's been made and is continuing.''
   About 75 people joined Mrs. King and civil rights figure Rosa
Parks at the opening session at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where
King and his father preached. Mrs. Parks sparked the modern civil
rights movement by her refusal to move to the back of a segregated
bus in Montgomery, Ala., in 1955. The subsequent bus boycott by
blacks in Montgomery was led by King, then a young preacher.
   Dorothy Height, president of the National Council of Negro
Women, said a forum to address issues concerning black women is
important in the current political climate.
   ``The righteous indignation that poured out across this country
is not there,'' she said. ``And we've got a job to do.''
   Mrs. King noted that women hold 23 of 435 House seats and two of
100 Senate seats. Only one of those 25 women, Rep. Cardiss Collins,
D-Ill., is black.
   Organizers of the conference, being held at the nearby Martin
Luther King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, say it is the
first national conference on women's role in the civil rights
movement and will be used as a forum to address issues that affect
women worldwide.

<TEXT>
   Novelist Naguib Mahfouz of Egypt, who
chronicled man's search for values in stories set from the Nile
delta of the pharaohs to the busy streets of modern Cairo, today
won the 1988 Nobel Prize for literature.
   The 76-year-old retired civil servant, who once had his work
banned in his native country, was the first Arabic-language writer
to win the award.
   ``I am happy, extremely happy, for myself and for Arab
literature,'' Mahfouz was quoted as saying by the government's
Middle East News Agency in Cairo.
   ``I remember at this moment my professors, Egyptian writers who
deserved this prize before me. ... It was a complete surprise
because I had no idea I was even nominated to win it,'' he was
quoted as saying.
   The 18-member Swedish Academy, which awards the prize, cited
Mahfouz as an author ``who, through works rich in nuance _ now
clear-sightedly realistic, now evocatively ambiguous _ has formed
an Arabian narrative art that applies to all mankind.''
   Mahfouz, a self-effacing coffeeshop habitue, produced a
half-century of literature. The academy said his work ``has meant a
powerful upswing for the novel as a genre and for the development
of the literary language in Arabic-speaking cultural circles.''
   ``The range is, however, greater than that. His work speaks to
us all,'' it said.
   Publishers and cultural page writers had urged that the academy
give this year's prize to someone other than a male from Europe or
the United States. The 87-year-old prize carries a $390,000 cash
prize.
   Speculation had included South African novelist and apartheid
critic Nadine Gordimer; American author Joyce Carol Oates; V.S.
Naipaul, a writer of Indian origin; and the perennially mentioned
Graham Greene of Britain.
   Last year's winner was exiled Soviet poet Joseph Brodsky.
   Sture Allen, the academy's secretary, said no one in the academy
read Mahfouz's works in the original Arabic. He declined to say
whether the decision was unanimous, but said the Egyptian writer
was one of five on the final list.
   Mahfouz set his early novels in the time of the pharaohs, but
his later works move to the crowded alleys of modern Cairo, said
the academy.
   Mahfouz, who spends an hour each day in bazaar coffee shops,
once said he considered his writing ``probably ... fourth or fifth
rate.''
   Although he ranks among Egypt's most popular writers, Mahfouz's
realistic, almost Dickensian portrayals of the wretched conditions
under which his country's poor live have made his popularity less
than unanimous.
   His 1967 novel, ``Miramar,'' attacked then-President Gamal Abdel
Nasser's domestic and pan-Arabist policies. The characters _ guests
at an Alexandria hotel _ pay lip service to the ideals of
revolution while privately holding them in contempt.
   The academy singled out Mahfouz's 1959 work ``Children of
Gebelawi,'' which was banned in his own country.
   The book's characters were based on Adam and Eve, Moses, Jesus,
Mohammed and a modern scientist.
   The academy described the work as ``an allegory of humanity's
historic destiny under the great monotheistic founders of
religion.''
   Arabic has between 150 and 200 million native speakers, but they
are concentrated in about 21 countries, many with small literate
populations.
   His major work was the Trilogy, completed in 1957, a 1,500-page
semi-autobiographical work.
   Twelve of Mahfouz's 40 novels or volumes of stories have been
translated into English, and a smaller number have been published
in German, French and Swedish.
   He also has written short stories, plays and more than 30 film
scripts based on his novels.
   Mahfouz worked in culture-related posts for the Egyptian
government until his retirement in 1971.
   His first novels were written at a time of nationalist foment in
Egypt before the 1952 revolution led by Nasser, who died in 1970.
The academy said these novels, set in ancient Egypt, were ``social
utopias written from the need of national identity.''
   The literature prize, begun in 1901, is one of five established
by the estate of Alfred Nobel, who left a fortune from his
invention and marketing of explosives. A sixth, the economics
prize, was added by the Bank of Sweden in 1968.
   Other Nobel prizes will be announced next week: medicine on
Monday, economics on Tuesday, and physics and chemistry on
Wednesday. The peace prize was given Sept. 29 to the U.N.
peacekeeping forces.

   Vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen
returned to the Capitol today and urged his Democratic colleagues
to get down to work for their party's national ticket.
   The Texas senator met with House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas,
and then spoke at a closed-door meeting of House Democrats. He
received loud applause several times in what attendees described as
a ``fire-'em-up'' address.
   He then strolled over to the Senate, where reporters were
allowed in for the beginning of his session with Democrats there.
   Bentsen received a standing ovation when introduced by Senate
Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. With a slip of the tongue,
Byrd seemed to express the feelings of many senators that Bentsen _
not Michael Dukakis _ should head the ticket.
   ``My colleagues, it's my pleasure to present to you the next
president _ the next vice president,'' Byrd said to roars from his
fellow Democrats.
   With Congress close to adjourning for the year, and attention
focused on tonight's final presidential debate, Bentsen took time
out from campaigning to spend most of the day in Washington.
   ``It's a call to arms,'' said Joe O'Neill, Bentsen's chief of
staff.
   The Democratic ticket this year has had much more support from
locally-elected officials than Walter Mondale did four years ago.
But aides say a total commitment is needed to squeeze out a victory.
   ``We can win this thing, but it's got to be everybody pulling
together,'' said O'Neill.
   Enter Bentsen, who regardless of his position on the ticket, has
tremendous clout because of his chairmanship of the Senate Finance
Committee. He declined to elaborate on what pitch he would throw to
get the Democrats in Congress moving.
   ``Oh, I don't want to tell them ahead of time,'' he said.
   Bentsen said he would be calling Dukakis on the telephone today
to wish him luck in the debate. He expressed confidence in the
Massachusetts governor, but denied there was any more pressure on
the Democrat than there is on Bush.
   ``I think it's important for both of them _ no more important
for Mike than it is for Bush,'' he said.
   Asked what advice he'd have for Dukakis, he said, ``I'm going to
say just what he said to me. Be yourself.''
   ``Hang loose,'' he added.
   Dukakis is not known for ``hanging loose,'' and has often been
criticized for being cold and aloof. Bentsen scoffed at reporters'
questions on that topic.
   ``He's going to do good, let's watch it, he'll do great,'' he
said.
   Bentsen planned to fly tonight to Houston to watch the debate
and then attend a post-debate rally there. On Friday, he's
scheduled to fly to California for a joint rally with Dukakis.
   On Wednesday, Bentsen campaigned in Missouri and Arkansas,
highlighting issues such as economic nationalism and Bush's choice
of Dan Quayle as a running mate which the Democrats hope Dukakis
can hammer home during the 90-minute, nationally broadcast debate.
   Bentsen told a crowd outside the courthouse in Columbia, Mo.,
about Quayle's assertion that ``America is still the envy of the
world.''
   ``But not because of people like Dan Quayle and George Bush, who
refuse to stand up for the American economy,'' he said.
   ``Today I read in the newspaper that Dan Quayle says he's going
to be his own campaign manager ... be his own ``Dr. Spin
Control,''' he said. ``That may be his pitch, but I'll bet it's
thrown George Bush a real curve ball.''
   Bentsen said Bush's choice of Quayle was another example of how
the vice president ``swings and misses.'' In the war against drugs:
``No runs, no hits, no progress,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Even moderate use of cocaine during the first
three months of pregnancy may lead to an increased risk of
spontaneous abortion and premature birth, a researcher says.
   The long-term effects of this so-called ``recreational'' use of
cocaine early during pregnancy are not yet known, said Dr. Kenneth
Jones, a birth defects specialist at the University of California,
San Diego.
   Earlier studies of women who use cocaine heavily, often in
combination with other drugs, suggest that cocaine can produce
abnormal behavior in 3-day-old infants and can lead to increased
risk of bleeding in the brain, which may or may not be related to
the behavioral difficulties, Jones said Wednesday night at the
annual meeting in New Orleans of the American Society of Human
Genetics.
   ``These are the most important things we know about prenatal
cocaine. We don't know how they (the infants) are going to do when
they grow up,'' he said in an interview. ``To label them
neurological cripples is unfair.''
   The infants show irritability and emotional distress when
handled or dressed, Jones said, adding that standard tests to
assess their health show that the infants have an impaired ability
to interact with their environment.
   In his ongoing study of modest cocaine users _ those who said
they used less than one gram of cocaine per week and said they used
no other drugs _ Jones found that 17 of the 73 women, or 23
percent, had spontaneous abortions.
   Thirteen women, or 18 percent, gave birth prematurely.
   Jones emphasized that the results are preliminary and that the
study has not been subjected to the scientific scrutiny that
customarily takes place before an article is accepted for
publication in a medical journal.
   Studies of heavy cocaine users have shown that they often
experience detachment of the placenta from the uterus, which can
produce spontaneous abortion if it occurs early in pregnancy or can
produce abrupt birth if it occurs later in pregnancy.
   This detachment and the behavioral problems associated with
cocaine use in pregnancy might all be consequences of the effects
cocaine has on the blood vessels, Jones said.
   Cocaine causes the blood vessels to tighten and narrow and
results in an increase in blood pressure. These changes could
trigger placenta separation and bleeding in the brain, Jones said.
   Further studies are necessary to assess these problems more
carefully, but such studies are difficult because many women who
use cocaine also use other drugs, and therefore it is difficult to
determine precisely which problems are associated with cocaine
rather than the other drugs, Jones said.
   Additionally, because cocaine use is presumed to be harmful
during pregnancy, researchers may suffer from a subtle bias in
which they seem to see more harm than can actually be proven to
occur from cocaine use during pregnancy.
   ``They may see things in the data that aren't there,'' he said.

   A jet tanker crash that killed six crewmen
and injured 10 other people probably was not weather-related, Air
Force officials said, but one serviceman said strong wind had
rocked the plane.
   ``The wind was blowing so hard. He (the pilot) tried to land but
the plane was rocking back and forth. The wings were going up and
down,'' said the crew chief of a nearby B-52 bomber.
   The witness, who spoke to the Detroit Free Press on the
condition his name not be used, was working on his plane about 300
yards from the site where the KC-135 Stratotanker went down Tuesday
at Wurtsmith Air Force Base.
   The Air Force has begun its investigation of the crash and it
could take months to complete, Air Force Capt. Robin Crumm said.
Air Force spokesmen have said weather probably played no part in
the crash.
   The crash was the worst accident involving the KC-135 since
March 13, 1987, when another jet tanker crashed near Fairchild Air
Force Base in eastern Washington, killing seven people.
   Flags across Oscoda, near the base in the northeastern Lower
Peninsula, flew at half-staff. A private memorial service was
scheduled for 10 a.m. Friday at the base chapel.
   ``Most of us knew the people on the plane,'' Staff Sgt. Pat
Hoover, a jet engine mechanic, said Wednesday. ``There's a lot of
emotion around the base.''
   One of the victims, plane commander Capt. Jeffrey Giles, 27, had
been married only one month and had just moved into a house with
his wife, Lorraine Giles.
   ``They were a neat couple with the whole world out in front of
them, and just as happy as they could be,'' said Kim Fullerton, who
sold them the house.
   The crash also killed Capt. Gerald Earhart, 33, of Montague;
co-pilot Capt. David B. Greene, 26, of Lakewood, Colo.; 2nd Lt.
Scott J. Szuter, 29, of Kirtland, Ohio; Airman 1st Class Robert L.
Parham, 23, of Fayetteville, N.C.; and Capt. William G. Russell,
33, of Panama City, Fla.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union appointed its first
deputy foreign minister, Yuli Vorontsov, its new ambassador to
Kabul, an Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman said today.
   The appointment of such a high-level official appeared to be
designed to emphasize the importance the Soviet Union will continue
to place on Afghanistan despite withdrawing its troops, Western
diplomats said.
   ``It puts a guy with a great deal of clout here to show how much
they support the place,'' one of the diplomats said on condition of
anonymity.
   The Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman, when asked why Moscow had
chosen someone of such high rank, said only that it meant
Afghanistan was an important country. Under briefing rules, the
spokesman is not identified.
   The spokesman also denied claims made in neighboring Pakistan
that the Moslem guerrillas battling Afghan troops shot down five
Afghan air force planes and helicopters last week.
   The U.S.-supported guerrillas have their headquarters in
Pakistan.
   Vorontsov will replace Nicholai Igorytchev, a member of the
Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee, whose departure
appeared quite abrupt.
   Igorytchev's farewell reception took place at midday today,
barely 24 hours after the invitations were received at other
diplomatic missions in Kabul. Such invitations are usually sent out
about two weeks in advance.
   The appointment of a new Soviet ambassador comes at a time when
both Moscow and the Soviet-style government in Kabul have been
stepping up diplomatic pressure to end the fighting between Afghan
government forces and U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas.
   Under an accord signed in Geneva on April 14, the Soviet Union
is to complete the pullout of its troops from Afghanistan by Feb.
15, 1989. The withdrawal started May 15 and is now at the halfway
point with an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 soldiers remaining in
Afghanistan.
   Soviet forces intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979.

   A major nuclear weapons test today
registered 5.8 on the Richter scale and shook high-rise hotels and
apartment buildings in this gaming capital, 80 miles from ground
zero.
   The 5.8 reading on the measure of ground motion at the National
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo. was one of the
highest from a nuclear test in some time, according to center
spokesman Russ Needham.
   The 7 a.m. blast prompted calls to operators at some Las Vegas
resorts, with guests asking if there had been an earthquake.
   The test, code-named Dalhart, was the 11th conducted this year
at the Nevada Test Site and the 686th announced blast at the remote
desert site since testing began there in January 1951.
   The nuclear device was buried 2,100 feet beneath the surface of
Yucca Flat.
   Energy Department spokeswoman Barbara Yoerg, who was in a
control building 12 miles from ground zero at the time of
detonation, said the building was still swaying perceptibly 20
seconds afterward.
   Ms. Yoerg, who has been at the site for many of the blasts, said
today's was one of the strongest she has felt.
   She said the test had an explosive force of less than 150
kilotons, the limit set by U.S.-Soviet treaty. The shot would have
been near the upper limits based on the Richter reading and the
building motion described by Nevadans.
   Dora Rosso, a switchboard operator at the Energy Department
office west of the Las Vegas Strip, said, ``Venetian blinds started
moving side by side, then we could feel the chair moving side by
side.''
   ``This is the first one we've felt in a long time at ground
level,'' she said. ``You were very aware of it. There was a
quivering motion for about a minute.''

<HEAD>Notes Show Peary Faked Claim He Reached North Pole</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newly uncovered notes kept by Robert E. Peary
show the explorer claimed to be the first person to reach the North
Pole even though he knew he hadn't come closer than 121 miles, an
astronomer and historian says.
   The new evidence indicates Peary knew exactly how far away he
was and turned back when supplies ran low and warming weather
threatened to make the floating ice too dangerous, Dennis Rawlins
said in an interview today.
   Peary had been under pressure to publicly declare his 1909
expedition a success, said Rawlins, who uncovered a previously
sealed file in the Johns Hopkins University library.
   ``My feeling is his reaction was he had to make the claim
because he had published a book in 1907 saying he got close and it
didn't sell at all,'' Rawlins said.
   ``He had the task of hoaxing the world while under the harshest
spotlight, all the while accusing his archrival (explorer Frederick
A. Cook) of faking the very same attainment. The amazing thing is
he had the guts and the intelligence to pull it off.''
   Rawlins' findings, published Wednesday in the Washington Post,
are the latest salvo in an 80-year geographical dispute over
whether Peary was the first to reach the North Pole, and, if not,
whether he knew how far off the mark he had been.
   The Peary controversy erupted almost immediately after the
explorer lodged his claim because he did not provide evidence, such
as the records of his sextant readings, to show he had been at the
pole.
   A slip of paper with Peary's sextant readings and other
navigational calculations, apparently written while he was at his
northernmost point during the expedition, was suppressed by Peary
and then was sealed and placed in the National Archives along with
his other papers many years after his death in 1920.
   In 1984, Peary's descendants unsealed the papers, containing
mostly numbers that remained undeciphered until Rawlins obtained
them.
   Peary's scrawled calculations, understandable only to someone
familiar with navigation by the stars, show the explorer came no
closer to the pole than 121 miles, according to Rawlins.
   Despite the cover-up, Rawlins says Peary still discovered the
northernmost point of land in the world, Cape Jesup in northern
Greenland, and ranks as the greatest U.S. polar explorer. In
addition, Peary should be credited with completing a difficult
400-mile crossing over land through an obstacle course of drifting
ice floes.
   ``There had to have been a core of integrity to him or he
wouldn't have kept this record,'' Rawlins said. ``The reason I
believe he kept it was because he was so justly proud of the
greatest journey in the history of Arctic exploring.''
   Long before finding the new evidence, Rawlins had suspected
Peary missed his mark. In 1970, based on Peary's diaries and
testimony from his companion on the trip, Matthew Henson, he wrote
an article in the U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings making a strong
case that Peary's claim was fraudulent.
   In 1973, Rawlins published a book, ``Peary at the North Pole:
Fact or Fiction?,'' providing additional evidence against Peary's
claim.
   In the September issue of National Geographic magazine, a
British Arctic expert wrote that new knowledge of Arctic weather,
currents and ice drift and analysis of Peary's documents indicate
he missed the mark by 30 to 60 nautical miles.

<TEXT>
   A 50-state survey involving nearly 10,000 likely
voters has found George Bush leading solidly in the presidential
race that counts _ the state-by-state contest for electoral votes.
   Surveys have found a close race between Republican presidential
nominee Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis across the nation as a
whole. But the ABC News-Washington Post poll examined their
standings in each state, where the election actually is decided.
   The result: Bush led firmly in 21 states with 220 electoral
votes _ just 50 short of the total needed to win, ABC reported
Wednesday. Dukakis was ahead in three states and the District of
Columbia, for 30 electoral votes.
   Voter sentiments can change before the Nov. 8 election and some
polls have indicated different outcomes than the ABC-Post survey,
which was notable for its size and scope.
   Bush called the survey ``interesting and encouraging,'' but said
he would stick to his strategy. He told ABC: ``If polls are
encouraging it makes me feel good, but I also remember when they
weren't.''
   The poll was conducted among 9,778 likely voters in the 50
states and the District of Columbia from Sept. 21 through Monday.
Margins of error varied with differing sample sizes in each state,
and ABC would not disclose them.
   ABC and the Post also conducted a standard national survey that
put the race at 51 percent for Bush to 45 percent for Dukakis. A
CBS News-New York Times poll Wednesday had nearly the same margin
for Bush: 47-42.
   National polls measure sentiment across the nation as a whole.
But in the election each state gives its electoral votes to the
winner in that state, so state-by-state standings are more relevant.
   Such surveys rarely are done because polling in all the states
requires a far larger sample than surveying the nation as a whole.
The ABC-Post poll interviewed 100 to 500 voters in each state.
   Sampling error was high for the poll with the margin of error
for each state ranging from five to 10 percentage points. Pollsters
for the network said they had large enough samples to characterize
the state races.
   Those they put firmly in Bush's column included Texas, where
recent state polls have given him a 10-point lead; New Jersey,
where he led by eight points in a state poll last week; and Ohio,
where he led in a state poll a month ago by just four points. The
states they said were leaning toward Bush included New York, where
most other recent polls have shown a slight Dukakis lead; and
California, where most recent polls have found a tie.

   A survey released today by The Buffalo News found Dukakis

   Political-Media Research Inc. of Washington, D.C., conducted the
survey of 850 registered voters Monday and Tuesday. The poll had a
margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.

Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin.
   _Firm for Dukakis: Hawaii, Massachusetts and Minnesota, and the
District of Columbia.
   _Leaning for Dukakis: Illinois, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Vermont.
   The CBS-Times poll, meanwhile, found increasing doubt about Sen.
Dan Quayle's qualifications to serve as president. By a 2-1 margin,
probable voters in the poll said they would worry about Quayle, the
Republican vice presidential nominee, if he had to take over as
president.
   The poll indicated the concern was keeping the race a close one
in terms of the contest nationally. When respondents were asked
their preference if they could vote for president only, without a
running mate, support for Dukakis dipped from 45 percent to 41
percent. Bush's remained at 50 percent.
   The CBS-Times poll was done Oct. 8 through Monday among 1,009
probable voters; The smaller, national ABC-Post poll was done Oct.
5 through Tuesday among 1,187 likely voters nationwide. Both had
four-point margins of error.

   State health officials say the weekend shutdown of
a plutonium processing building at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons
plant raises doubts on the facility's ability to clean up the
pollution it creates.
   Officials with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the
Colorado Department of Health said Wednesday that the closure would
prompt them to take a closer look at the plant operator's plans to
remove pollution there.
   ``The question is one of the competence of the people
involved,'' said Mike Sattler of the health department.
   Rockwell International Corp. operates the plant for the U.S.
Department of Energy.
   ``The shutdown and ongoing cleanup operations are separate
issues, but our visibility may increase as a result of it,'' said
EPA's Nat Miullo. ``We may have more frequent inspections of the
plant. We have to be more visible.''
   State officials and the EPA are studying 107 polluted sites at
the plant and designing plans to clean them. Rocky Flats officials
are providing most of the information about the sites and
recommending cleanup operations.
   The area of most immediate concern is known as the 881 hillside,
where chemical pollution has tainted groundwater and threatens
Woman Creek.
   DOE officials in Washington on Saturday stopped operations in
Building 771, where Rockwell manufactures triggers for the nuclear
weapons and recovers plutonium from contaminated materials and old
parts.
   The shutdown resulted from an incident earlier this year when
three men went into a restricted area without respirators. The
incident posed no health threat to the men, DOE officials said.

   A jury has ordered a restaurant to pay
$225,000 to a former employee whose legs were badly burned by
steaming soup.
   The judge ruled Mr. Laff's Riverfront Restaurant violated
child-labor laws in hiring Mildred Arena of Jensen Beach, then 15,
and allowing her to work excessive hours without proper
documentation. She spilled a pot of soup on her legs while working
more than two years ago.
   ``I could take all the money in the world and nothing could heal
my scars. Nothing could make up for this,'' Ms. Arena, 17, said of
the scars on her right ankle and thigh.
   She said a customer bumped her arm, causing her to spill the
soup and fall.
   She is to receive the money in December, after her 18th birthday.
   The civil trial went to the jury Wednesday after Circuit Judge
Martha Warner told the panel Mr. Laff's had violated labor laws.
Because of that, the judge said, the restaurant was liable for 100
percent of Ms. Arena's injuries and the jurors were to decide the
amount of the award.
   ``Then we have no defense,'' attorney Rick Rodgers told the
judge. ``Our only defense was her own negligence.''
   Ms. Arena's attorney, Richard Kibbey, asked for no less than
$200,000 for pain, skin grafts and mental anguish.

<TEXT>
   Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jim Dunn
has filed suit against his own party, saying a national GOP
committee crippled his campaign by breaking a promise to contribute
$638,000.
   The former congressman said he filed the lawsuit in U.S.
District Court in Lansing on Wednesday as a last resort to get the
money in time to pay for television ads before the Nov. 8 election.
   The Democratic incumbent, Sen. Donald Riegle, holds a 2-1 lead
over Dunn in the latest polls.
   Dunn's lawsuit names as defendants the Republican National
Committee and one of its arms, the National Republican Senatorial
Committee. It seeks an emergency injunction ordering the senatorial
committee to come up with about $438,000 for his campaign.
   Dunn, an East Lansing home builder, said he had received
$200,000 from the committee, but had been told he wouldn't get the
rest, even though his financially strapped campaign couldn't afford
television ads without it.
   Dunn has spent $250,000 of his own money on his campaign and
said the promise of $638,000 from the senatorial committee was one
of the reasons he decided to enter the race.
   He said he didn't know why the senatorial committee had reneged
on its promise. ``They won't return my phone calls,'' he said.
   Tom Mason, a spokesman for the senatorial committee in
Washington, said it would have no direct comment on the lawsuit or
the commitment to Dunn.
   ``We don't like to fight in public with any of our guys. We
think it doesn't help anybody ... on the other hand, we don't
criticize them for anything they do if they think it will help
their campaign,'' Mason said.

   A petrochemical complex in southern Taiwan
remained closed Thursday, a day after angry fishermen protesting
industrial pollution invaded the site and switched off the
electricity, officials reported.
   The 2,000 fishermen said chemical pollutants from the Linyuan
Industrict District, about 200 miles south of Taipei, have
destroyed their fishing grounds, said Yang Shih-chien, head of the
Industrial Development Bureau.
   Some fishermen remained at the complex Thursday to prevent
workers from entering its 18 factories, officials said.
   On Wednesday, the fishermen attacked several guards and workers,
who suffered minor injuries, and destroyed some factory equipment,
officials said.
   Lee Ching-chung, deputy director of the Environmental Protection
Bureau, blamed the pollution on a water waste treatment plant.
   The fishermen want the factories to pay them $25 million in
compensation.
   The companies, including one operated by the state-run Chinese
Petroleum Corp., are major producers of ethylene, propylene and
other raw materials for textile and plastic industries.

   The United States and the Soviet Union today
signed a five-year agreement providing for joint research programs
to combat AIDS, drug abuse, alcoholism and polio.
   Signing for the Soviet side, Valentin Pokrovsky, president of
the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, expressed hope that the
ceremony will mark the ``beginning of a wonderful long road which
we will travel together.''
   Samuel O. Thier, president of the National Institute of
Medicine, signed for the United States. The ceremony at the
National Academy of Sciences featured champagne toasts and numerous
expressions of friendship and good will.
   The initial plans call for several joint activities in 1989,
including a symposium in the United States on AIDS research and a
meeting in the Soviet Union on the health effects of radiation.
   At a news conference Wednesday night, Pokrovsky said the last
summit meeting between President Reagan and Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev and the ``general political atmosphere'' have
contributed to closer cooperation. He wore a lapel pin displaying
the Soviet and American flags.
   He said AIDS and nuclear radiation are two logical areas for
cooperative research.
   Pokrovsky said American experts are particularly interested in
learning about the Soviet experience following the disaster at the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant in April 1986. Dozens of persons are
reported to have died in that accident.
   ``It would be gross negligence not to research in detail all
aspects of this accident,'' Pokrovsky said.
   At the same time, he said, Soviet doctors are eager to learn
more about how the American medical community deals with the AIDS
problem.
   He said there has been only one Soviet fatality since March 1987
as a result of AIDS, but 81 persons who are not yet sick have been
diagnosed as carrying AIDS antibodies. He acknowledged that the
percentage of Soviet citizens who have been tested for AIDS is
relatively small _ 11 million.
   There have been about 300 cases of non-Soviet citizens in the
Soviet Union afflicted with AIDS, primarily students from African
countries where there is a high incidence of the disease, Pokrovsky
said.
   While the AIDS problem ``has acquired almost catastrophic
dimensions'' in the United States, he said, it is only a
``localized infection'' in the Soviet Union.
   He suggested that one reason is that Soviet drug users are far
less susceptible to AIDS than their American counterparts.
   ``The incidence of drug abuse through a needle is very low in
the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   The research on drug abuse and alcoholism, Pokrovsky said, will
focus on the circumstances of addiction, possible genetic origins
and the effects on future generations.

   The United States today began airlifting food
and medical supplies to thousands of sick and starving people in
famine-ravaged southern Sudan after the Sudanese government agreed
to let the aid go thruough, the State Department said.
   The airlift got underway after a meeting in Khartoum of Sudanese
Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi, U.S. Ambassador G. Norman Anderson
and Walter Bollinger, an official of the U.S. Agency for
International Development.
   The agreement breaks a deadlock between the Sudanese government
and foreign aid donors. State Department spokesman Charles Redman
said food and medical supplies are being airlifted to prepositioned
storage points.
   The relief plan was drawn up by a team from the State
Department's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, the Sudanese
government and other donors, including private groups, according to
a cable from the U.S. ambassador in Khartoum. A copy was obtained
by The Associated Press.
   The cable quoted the Sudanese prime minister as saying:
   ``I have followed the work of the team which is helping us deal
with some of our problems. We appreciate that good work and feel it
enhances the friendly relations between our people and the people
of the United States.''
   The Sudanese government, which has fought an intermittent war
with Christians and Animists in the south who resisted the
imposition of Islamic law, had resisted delivery of food supplies
into rebel areas.
   Lately, however, the rebel Sudaense People's Liberation Army,
commanded by U.S.-educated Col. John Garang, has fired on relief
planes and convoys, making assistance difficult. The rebels are
backed by the Marxist government in Ethiopia.
   The United States has good relations with Sudan, which received
$100 million in American aid last year. In Africa, only Egypt gets
more U.S. economic assistance.
   Bollinger was quoted in the cable as saying the relief plan
``reflects a joint effort on the part of the United States and The
Sudan to provide essential food and medicines to thousands of
people who face death from hunger and disease.''
   The English-language newspaper Sudan Times reported on Wednesday
that troops and rebels weree fighting house-to-house in the
besieged southern Sudanese town of Torit and that Roman Catholic
Archbishop Paride Taban had sent a plea: ``We implore you to pray
for peace.''
   The army meanwhile confirmed reports by the People's Liberation
Army that the rebels had captured Ikotos, a town near Torit. It
said soldiers made a ``tactical withdrawal'' from the town.
   The army claimed its 108-man garrison had inflicted many
casualties among more than 3,000 rebels attacking from three sides
but gave no figures for casualties. The rebels said Friday that 62
soldiers had died in the three-day battle and that 300 had fled
into Uganda.
   The fall of Ikotos gives the rebels control over three towns
that form a triangle around Torit, capital of East Equatoria
province, 85 miles east of Juba, the largest city in the south.
Liberation Army fighters captured Kialla and Katire weeks ago.
   The Sudan Times said street fighting was reported this week in
Torit and that the archbishop has been sending appeals for food and
other relief supplies for the besieged populace.
   ``This is my last message to you,'' Taban's message read,
according to the newspaper. ``We implore you to pray for peace.''
   He said Catholic agencies in his diocese have nothing else to
offer Torit's thousands of hungry people, but the town has given up
on expecting help from the outside, the newspaper reported.
   Bollinger was quoted in the cable that reached the State
Department today as saying ``critical food shortages brought on by
civil strife in the South, heavy rains and other problems have
driven thousands of people from the countryside into towns were
resources have been streatched beyond limit.''
   He added: ``The U.S. is pleased to be able to join others in the
donor community in assistant the government of Sudan in its efforts
to support the men, women and children who are at risk.''
   The relief operation began with planes carrying food and medical
supplies from storage points in in Kadugli, outside Abyei, to Al
Muglad and Babanusa to the West, the cable from Khartoum said.
   Ambassador Anderson reported that flight operations will begin
to other locations in southern Kordofan, which has been isolated
and where hundreds of thousands of displaced people face possible
starvation.
   In addition to the food supplies, the cable said, the relief
plan also calls for drugs and medical supplies to assist 250,000
people for three months.
   Last week, the State Department and the Agency for International
Development deplored recent attacks on relief efforts by insurgents
in the South.
   AID said nine Kenyan drivers and assistants had been killed or
were missing and several relief trucks had been disabled or
abandoned. The U.S. agency accused the People's Liberation Army of
trying to shoot down a civilian relief aircraft carrying American
supplies to Juba on Sept. 25.
   ``We deplore these outrageous actions which target trucks and
planes that are undertaking humanitarian missions,'' State
Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said. ``We call on all
parties to the conflict in Sudan to avoid interference with the
movement of emergency relief operations so that the hungry might be
fed and the sick attended.''

<HEAD>Jury Deadlocks on Drunken Riding Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAYNESVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trial of a man charged with drunken
driving _ on horseback _ has ended in a deadlocked jury.
   ``If they're going to take your license for riding a horse, they
ought to make you have tags and a license for it,'' said defendant
Barry Michael Treadway after the mistrial Wednesday.
   Assistant District Attorney Art Jacobson said he believed some
of the jurors were troubled about applying the drunken driving law
against a horseman. He said he had not decided whether to pursue
the case.
   Treadway, 26, of Canton had been convicted in District Court
last month, and the jury was impaneled to hear his appeal.
   Treadwell was arrested about 2 a.m. July 24 by city police who
found him sitting atop a horse in the parking lot of Homer's Keg
Room.
   Officers testified Monday that Treadway was ``fussin' and
cussin''' and appeared intoxicated when he dismounted.
   Treadway said he was not the man who had been seen riding the
horse around the parking lot.
   The horse's owner, who had been at a horse show nearby, asked
Treadway to hold the horse while he stepped inside to use the
telephone, the defendant said.
   Treadway admitted drinking four to five beers at the horse show
several hours before his arrest, and a Breathalyzer test at the
police station indicated a blood alcohol level of 0.10, the legal
minimum for intoxication.
   Treadway's conviction in District Court netted him a seven-day
jail term, $500 fine and loss of his driver's license for four
years. He risked losing his license for up to five years if
convicted in Superior Court, but said he appealed _ in part _ to
fight a law he considered unfair.

   California sea lions are threatened by
a mysterious illness marked by seizures so violent some have bitten
off teeth, according to the California Marine Mammal Center.
   So far, 28 sea lions stricken with the new malady have been
found on beaches and trucked to the center, located at an old Army
fort in Marin County, said center spokeswoman Mary Jane Schramm.
   Twenty of the sick mammals were found on the San Luis Obispo
County coast while others were scattered as far north as Santa Cruz.
   Eight sea lions have died, including one that had a very high
level of lead in its body.
   Schramm said the center is testing for lead poisoning as well as
arsenic, cadmimum, copper, iron and zinc. Other tests are designed
to find natural toxins or other compounds in the food chain.
   The first sick sea lion arrived April 30 at the center, which
was already packed with sea lions suffering from leptospirosis.
Schramm said that 105 sea lions have been diagnosed with that
disease since June 1, and more than half have died.

   Army troops were responsible
for the massacre of 10 peasants last month, the attorney general's
office said today.
   Carlos Lazo, of the Attorney General's Human Rights Department,
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that his office
requested the arrest of four soldiers implicated in the Sept. 21
slayings.
   The armed forces first said the dead were guerrillas, but then
changed its version to say eight civilians were killed in a
guerrilla ambush and army troops killed two of the ambushers.
   Lazo said the federal judge in San Sebastian, 30 miles east of
San Salvador, was asked to issue warrants for the arrests.
   San Sebastian's jurisdiction covers the village of San
Francisco, where, according to residents, soldiers of the Jiboa
battalion used grenades and rifle fire to kill seven men and three
women suspected of collaboration with leftist guerrillas.
   ``We have asked the judge to order the arrest of four people,
all soldiers in the Jiboa battalion,'' said Lazo. ``Sufficient
evidence exists to justify their detention; the testimony of the
relatives, the neighbors. The local and international press knows
that those who killed them (the victims) were soldiers.''
   Lazo said residents of San Francisco reported up to eight
soldiers were involved in the slayings and that more arrests could
be requested. He said no officer has been implicated.
   The slayings were the first massacre of such magnitude
attributed to government forces in four years.
   A 9-year-old civil war pitting leftist guerrillas against
government forces has killed an estimated 65,000 people, most of
them civilians.

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright today advised his
party's presidential candidate, Michael Dukakis, to get rid of his
slick commercials and ``be himself, relax and say it like it is''
for the final 26 days of the campaign.
   ``People who know Mike Dukakis like him,'' Wright told
reporters, ``as a human being, warm, with feelings and
convictions.''
   He said the Massachusetts governor should ``get rid of these
commercials that try to hawk the candidate like toothpaste or soap
flakes. ... When that happens, we're going to win.''
   Wright, D-Texas, called his comments ``constructive
suggestions'' and not criticism of the Dukakis media machine, but
added: ``I think the media advisers (not just for Dukakis, but in
general) are too clever by half.''
   He told a story of having bought a block of 30 minutes on
television in one congressional campaign where he faced strong
opposition, against the advice of media experts who told him no one
would listen for that long.
   ``You can't tell me that people won't listen to something
serious,'' Wright said. ``This is serious business. This is the
future of America.''
   And he called the efforts of Vice President George Bush to base
the GOP campaign on matters like the American flag and the
Massachusetts prison furlough system ``petty and silly and cheap
and trivial.''
   ``All the states have furlough programs, and he (Dukakis)
inherited that from a Republican predecessor,'' Wright said. To use
it as campaign fodder is ``unworthy of a presidential campaign.
Perhaps if you were running for sheriff ...'' Wright said.
   ``And for any party to claim the American flag as its exclusive
property surely is beneath the dignity of a nation like this. This
is America _ we're too big to spend our time on all this little
petty stuff.''

<HEAD>Students Hold March To Protest Sexual Attacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of University of Illinois students
held a candlelight march and rally to protest a series of sexual
attacks on campus and the sexism that organizers said lies at the
root of the problem.
   ``Sexism, making women sex objects, is closely tied to the
degradation of women, which ultimately can lead to rape,'' said
Laurel MacLaren, one of the students who put together Wednesday
night's demonstration.
   The rally was called to ``raise the awareness'' of students to a
string of 13 sexual attacks since April by what police have labeled
a serial rapist.
   About 500 students, most holding candles, took part in the march
and the rally at the university's Urbana campus.
   ``I've been raped as many of the women on this campus have,''
student Jenny Keller said at the rally. ``We're not asking for
pity. ... We're demanding respect ... for the strength it takes to
go through this experience.''
   The rally also called attention to an increasing number of
``acquaintance rapes,'' in which the two people know each other,
MacLaren said.
   Another speaker at the rally, Jeff Jochims, president of the
university's Inter-fraternity Council, called on university
officials to solve ``the No. 1'' problem on the campus and ``make
sure this place is safe.''
   Rally organizers also condemned one of the traditional rites of
college life, the panty raid.
   ``We're working to change the image of fraternities,'' Jochims
said.
   Last month, a campus sorority, Gamma Phi Beta, signed a criminal
complaint against the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity after fraternity
members raided the sorority house and attempted to throw a sorority
member into a shower, Jochims said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Geographic Society finally
changed its view of the world on Thursday.
   And still had it flat.
   Society officials unveiled a new world map, drawn by a
projection method that differs radically from the one it has used
since 1922, and said they would distribute 10.5 million copies with
the December issue of the National Geographic magazine.
   ``After more than a half-century of using the Van der Grinten
projection, the National Geographic Society is adopting the
Robinson projection, which we believe more clearly portrays the
world as it really is,'' said John B. Garver Jr., chief
cartographer for the society.
   Both Robinson and Van der Grinten are known as compromise
projections, according to the American Congress on Surveying and
Mapping.
   ``You can't have what you want. You would like to have all the
right sizes and all the right shapes,'' said Arthur H. Robinson,
developer of the new map.
   But because any flat map distorts some parts of the Earth,
mapmakers have to try and find a balance between the relative size
and shape of continents, their relationships with one another and
the oceans separating them.
   Garver said that Robinson's projection has less distortion in
the size of land masses located far from the Equator, making
countries such as Canada and the Soviet Union appear closer to
their real size.
   In addition, by reducing the size distortion of land areas the
Robinson map shows more of the Earth's surface as water. That also
is a more accurate portrayal, since 71 percent of the planet's
surface is
   water.
   Robinson, a professor emeritus at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, began developing his mapping ideas during World
War II, refined them in the 1950s and produced his projection in
1963.
   ``I hesitate to say this, but it is pretty much an artistic
process rather than a scientific one. You try to get the most
realistic view of the world,'' said Robinson. ``I worked with the
variables until it got to the point where, if I cnaged one of them,
it didn't get any better. And so, I stopped.''
   Based on an ellipse, the Robinson projection has lines of
longitude curving toward the poles, as does the Van der Grinten
that it replaces. But the poles are points on the Van der Grinten
maps and lines on Robinson's projection.
   The Van der Grinten projection, developed in 1904 by American
engineer Alphons van der Grinten, is based on a circle. It was
adopted by the society in 1922.
   Probably the best known map projection is the Mercator,
developed some 400 years ago, which has straight lines of longitude
and latitude forming a grid on a rectangular map.
   It became popular because it allows navigators to plot their
courses as straight lines, the only map on which this can be done.
However, it greatly distorts the size of land areas away from the
equator.
   National Geographic maps, however, are not intended as
navigational charts, leaving the society free to try to find better
perspectives as to the sizes of major areas.
   ``A poorly chosen map projection can actually be harmful. We
tend to believe what we see, and when fundamental geographical
relationships such as shapes, sizes, directions and so on are badly
distorted, we are inclined to accept them as fact if we see them
that way on maps,'' the American Cartographic Association has
commented.
   Robinson's map is considered superior to the Van der Grinten
because it is less distorted at areas distant from the Equator.
   For example, on Van der Grinten maps Greenland appears to be 554
percent larger than it really is, while it is only distorted by 60
percent on the Robinson projection.
   On Van der Grinten maps the Soviet Union appears 223 percent too
large and the United States seems to be 68 percent bigger than it
actually is. On the Robinson maps the Soviet Union is just 18
percent larger than it should be, and the United States is 3
percent smaller.

   Lake Tahoe has dropped below the level
of its outlet for only the fifth time in 54 years, cutting off its
flow into the Truckee River.
   The Truckee provides water for Reno residents, Pyramid Lake and
Fallon-area farmers. Federal Watermaster Garry Stone said Thursday
that water from Donner Lake and from various creeks and streams
will keep the Truckee flowing downstream from Tahoe.
   Through Reno, 30 miles downstream from Tahoe, the current flow
is a sluggish 10 cubic feet per second.
   Stone said talks are continuing on whether to seek permission to
pump from Tahoe. That last occurred in the Dust Bowl year of 1934.

   One Art Deco hotel is now in ruins, but
the Miami Design Preservation League says that no more Deco
buildings will fall in Miami Beach's South Beach section.
   ``We know that we have had many successes in getting the world's
attention for the Art Deco District,'' Nancy Liebman, the group's
acting director, said shortly after the 39-year-old three-story
Senator Hotel was razed Wednesday to clear the way for a parking
lot.
   ``We are proud that we have changed the laws so that this can
never happen again,'' she said.
   The city of Miami Beach amended its ordinances after the Royale
Group, which owned the Senator, got a permit to destroy it, Liebman
said.
   ``The preservation board now has the authority to deny
demolition of important structures,'' she said.
   The Senator featured etched glass that had appeared in books and
magazines around the world. Royale said it was required to provide
parking as a condition to obtain loans for refurbishing other
properties it owns in the Art Deco district.

<TEXT>
   Naguib Mahfouz, winner of the 1988 Nobel
Prize for Literature, is a habitue of bazaar coffee shops and once
called his writing ``fourth or fifth rate.''
   Although he ranks among Egypt's most popular writers, Mahfouz's
realistic, almost Dickensian portrayals of the wretched conditions
under which his country's poor live have made his popularity less
than unanimous.
   One book of his was banned from Egypt, and another attacked
then-President Gamal Abdel Nasser's domestic and pan-Arabist
policies.
   Widely translated, he writes in Arabic but has little respect
for Arab writers, including himself. Once asked to rate his work,
Mahfouz said: ``Probably like the rest of modern Arabic literature,
fourth or fifth rate.''
   He spends an hour a day in the coffee shops of Khan Khalili,
soaking in the ambiance of one of the Middle East's oldest and
largest bazaars.
   He is widely popular throughout the region but does not relish
public acclaim.
   Mahfouz was born in Cairo in 1911, the youngest child of a
lower-middle-class family. He showed no interest in foreign
literature before he entered the King Fuad I University in 1930,
but his strongest influences in college became the
turn-of-the-century British social realist novelists and Victorian
writers.
   Scholars generally place Mahfouz's writing in three periods:
   The first featured ``Trilogy,'' a 1,500-page partly
autobiographical work he completed in 1952. That period entailed
three historical novels and then a series on social themes,
detailing the struggles of Egyptian society.
   Mahfouz's second period began in 1959, when he turned away from
social realism toward metaphysical allegory. The specialists
Marsden Jones and Hamdi Sakkut wrote in 1978 that in this period
Mahfuz ``forsook ... man in society for man in time.''
   Beginning with ``Miramar'' in 1967, which took aim at Nasser's
domestic and pan-Arabist policies, Mahfouz's third period shows a
synthesis of the first two periods.
   Mahfouz's novels are more historical chronicles than political
treatises, their only political meaning being a tangential
reflection of conditions that politics cause.
   Nevertheless, after Nasser's Free Officers Movement overthrew
the Egyptian monarchy in 1952, Mahfouz showed his displeasure by
stopping writing for seven years.
   His 1959 allegory ``Children of Gebelawi,'' which included
characters based on Adam and Eve, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed and a
modern scientist, was banned because it contained religious themes
deemed unacceptable in Arab society.
   Although he writes in Arabic, his knowledge of ancient Arabic
literature is slight. He much prefers writers of the English

<HEAD>U.S. Embargoes Tuna From Four Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imports of yellowfin tuna from four nations
will be embargoed starting Oct. 16 because those countries have not
shown that they are following rules to prevent the accidental
killing of porpoises, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration announced Thursday.
   The embargo affects tuna from Ecuador, Panama, Venezuela and the
Pacific island nation of Vanuatu.
   The United States imported about $30 million worth of yellowfin
tuna from these countries last year, officials said.
   Yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific tend to swim with
porpoises, and when fishermen try to net the tuna porpoises can
become trapped and drown. Beginning last March, the United States
required foreign countries to provide evidence that their fishermen
make efforts to protect porpoises, as the U.S. fishing fleet is
required to do.

   Jessica McClure, the toddler who cried and
softly sang a nursery rhyme while trapped 58 hours in an abandoned
well, shows little sign of her ordeal one year after her daring
rescue, her doctor says.
   And Midlanders are still proud of how their community responded
to the little girl's plight while the nation watched and waited.
   Jessica, now 2{, lost her right little toe and the tip of her
big toe because of her ordeal. She walks normally and doesn't seem
to suffer from emotional problems such as nightmares or phobias,
said orthopedic surgeon Charles Younger.
   ``She's a pretty extroverted, personable child,'' Younger said.
``I think she's an intelligent child. Obviously, when she was 1{
and she was singing `Winnie-the-Pooh' in the well, I think a lot of
people thought she wouldn't be able to do that.''
   It is that image _ of a toddler crying for her mother and
bravely singing while trapped in a dark, narrow shaft _ that
captured the imaginations of rescue workers and millions of
television viewers.
   Jessica fell into the 8-inch-wide abandoned well shaft Oct. 14,
1987, and was wedged 22 feet underground. The water well was in her
aunt's back yard, where she was playing.
   Midland firefighters and paramedics feared the shaft would
collapse on top of Jessica if they tried to dig directly to her.
Private drilling companies and engineers rushed to help and
suggested using high-speed, diamond-tipped drills to bore through
the hard rock surrounding the well.
   While paramedics blew warm air into the shaft to keep Jessica
warm, drillers worked around the clock to break through the rock,
their progress agonizingly slow. They sank the parallel shaft, then
broke through from below the toddler.
   When the gauze-wrapped girl was rushed to the surface on the
night of Oct. 16, rubbing her eyes in the glare of floodlights,
Midlanders poured into the streets honking their car horns.
   The crowd at the Midland High football game that night roared
when the announcer interrupted the contest to relay the news.
   ``I look upon it like many Midlanders do, and that's with
pride,'' said Darlene Gifford, co-chairman of the Midland Spirit
Committee. ``Not only that we did it and brought her out alive, but
that we all got together to do it.''
   The spirit committee organized a celebratory parade a few weeks
after Jessica's rescue, and commissioned a commemorative bronze
plaque that Jessica is scheduled to unveil Saturday in downtown
Midland.
   The 4-foot-high, 6-foot-wide plaque depicts Jessica being
plucked out of the well. It is meant as a thank-you to companies
that donated drilling equipment and other heavy machinery, and to
the hundreds of volunteers who drilled the hole, handed out food
and drinks and supervised the effort.
   ``We'd had some pretty tough times with the oil business, and it
kind of distanced us from our problems,'' Mayor Carroll Thomas said
of the 2{-day drama. ``It made us realize we have friends and
neighbors.''
   The rescue and Jessica's recovery are remembered with fondness
and nostalgia.
   ``Jessica's room,'' Midland Memorial pediatric nurse Cindi
Walker said, lightly tapping her fingers on Room 330's door as she
walked past. ``Most of the people we put in here get excited
because it was Jessica's room.
   ``She was so cute. She was really tolerant of all the things we
had to do. Most kids don't like it when we have to poke and stick
things in them, but she didn't mind much.''
   Jessica was hospitalized for more than a month and underwent at
least six operations on her right foot, which had been jammed
between her head and the wall of the well. The foot was so damaged
from lack of circulation that doctors considered amputating it. She
also had a pressure wound on her forehead.
   Her doctor said cosmetic surgery has made the forehead scar
inconspicuous. Younger also said the missing toe won't have much
effect.
   The McClure family's spokesman, Pete Snelson, said Jessica and
her parents, Chip and Cissy, are recognized just about everywhere
they go.
   ``People are nice to them,'' Snelson said. ``But their privacy
was taken away.''
   The McClures have declined most interview requests.
   Following the rescue, the Town Council ordered that all
abandoned wells be capped or plugged and a state official
criticized Jessica's aunt for inadequately supervising the
youngster before the accident.
   Two groups of volunteers have negotiated movie rights to the
story of Jessica's rescue. Snelson said it will be difficult for
moviemakers to capture the depth of emotion Midlanders felt during
the frenzied rescue effort.
   ``It was a very cohesive force, an outpouring of a common
objective,'' he said. ``It sort of made the economic problems fade
into the background. It gives off a good feeling when you're in
town. It's been an uplifting experience.''

Thursday.
   Affected are fuzzy squeeking duck ornaments and wooden Hansel
and Gretel ornaments, used on packages gift-wrapped by the company
in 1987 and early 1988.
   The duck could present a choking hazard, while the Hansel and
Gretel contains more lead in its paint than allowed by law, the
commission said.
   Consumers who received the ornaments as part of a gift-wrapped
parcel should return them to the nearest Nieman-Marcus store for a
refund of the wrapping charge.

<TEXT>
   The graceful sight of Canada geese slicing through
the sky in their ``V'' formation has become a foreboding sight in
the Northeast.
   ``They're very pretty to look at. Unfortunately they leave
problems behind,'' says Elaine Moore, a selectman in the town of
Stoneham where police on horseback conducted daily goose roundups
this spring.
   In Stoneham, like many other towns across the region, the birds
were welcomed when they started fluttering in about six years ago.
   ``They would cross Main Street and you would see the mother and
the little goslings behind her. The traffic would stop and let
these sweet little things go across the street,'' Ms. Moore said.
   The welcome soon wore out as the birds chewed up golf courses,
lawns and landscaped office parks, leaving behind liberal
smatterings of their pungent calling cards.
   Over the past six years more and more geese have appeared in the
Northeast, with more birds stopping short in their journey south.
Homegrown flocks have also grown.
   A Canadian expert on the wild geese said one reason for the
upsurge in local gaggles is the creation of ideal breeding grounds
in parks and on golf courses: areas of short, fertilized grass
surrounding a body of water.
   ``If you wanted to make a place for geese, you could not do
better than that,'' said Harry Lumsden, who worked for 40 years for
Canada's Ministry of Natural Resources in Ontario and now is a
private consultant.
   ``We make the mistake of allowing the geese to get the idea that
this park or this golf course is a nice safe place with good
food,'' he said.
   In Stoneham, a town of 23,000 about 10 miles north of Boston,
residents complained of being kept awake by the honking and had to
shoo birds from their lawns with brooms. The town reservoir was
clogged with droppings and police resorted to horseback roundups in
May to corral the birds at a downtown intersection, Ms. Moore said.
   George Haas, migratory bird specialist at the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service's Boston office, said geese can be found along the
coast from Maine to Florida, but the highest concentrations are
from Maryland northward.
   Winter population inventories from last year showed 76,900 in
New York, 90,200 in New Jersey, 6,900 in Connecticut and 13,600 in
Massachusetts, Haas said. Federal officials aren't able to
determine exactly which geese are migrating and which have settled
in a state, he said.
   The federally protected birds face few predators and are smart
enough to outwit many hunters during the limited season, he said.
   Several states have implemented hunting seasons, Haas said. In
Massachusetts, about 3,000 birds were bagged in an experimental
season last year.
   One of the more innovative goose-control methods is the SS
Bytex, a radio-controlled miniature boat. The boat has been in
action since last spring, buzzing around a pond at Bytex Corp. in
Southborough to scare off geese, said owner and self-styled
``goosebuster'' Norman Heifetz.
   Lumsden said farmers in Ontario can apply for permits to kill
nuisance birds, but scaring the birds away from prime grazing
grounds with constant noisemakers is usually the most effective
method.
   ``Get after those birds in mid-May and don't give them a
moment's peace,'' he advised.

   Free advice to Michael Dukakis from House
Speaker Jim Wright: Get rid of your slick commercials, forget your
media advisers and simply talk to the American people.
   ``He's got to seize every opportunity that he has, be on any
talk show he can be on, get rid of these commercials that try to
hawk the candidate and party like toothpaste or soap flakes,''
Wright told reporters in answer to a question Thursday.
   ``People who know Mike Dukakis, they like him, they trust him,
they admire him, they respect him as a person, as a human being, a
warm individual with feelings and convictions,'' the Texas Democrat
said.
   He said Dukakis, trailing George Bush in the polls as Election
Day nears, should go on television and talk directly to the voters,
just as Wright said he did when he faced a critical House race in
Texas.
   ``Get on the tube and look people in the eye and talk with them
earnestly and let them get to know Mike Dukakis,'' Wright said.
``That's what we need to do, and when that happens, we're going to
win.
   ``I think the media advisers are too clever by half, and I've
always believed this,'' Wright said.
   In a personal example, he spoke of a major threat he had in a
campaign once.
   Against the recommendations of his advisers, Wright said, he
bought 30 minutes of television time to speak to voters in his
district.
   ``All the professionals, the cynics, the consultants said, `Oh,
no, you cannot hold them for 30 minutes. God almighty, they'll tune
you out,''' he said. Instead, he said, he program brought 2,000
phone calls offering help.
   ``They can't tell me that people won't listen to something
serious,'' he said. ``You don't have to get into a slogan and make
it into a cheap contest of carnival barkers. This is a serious
business.''
   Taking a shot at George Bush's Republican campaign, he said,
``For any party to try to claim the American flag as its exclusive
property surely is beneath the honor and the dignity of a nation
like this.''

   The presidential press conference has fallen
into ``a serious state of disarray'' under Ronald Reagan, who has
held relatively few such sessions, a Harvard commission says. But
Reagan's spokesman today said the report gave too much emphasis to
how many sessions are held.
   The panel of journalists and scholars urged the next president
to ``take his lumps on a more frequent basis.'' In its study on how
to revive White House news conferences, the panel also called for
making them routine _ and mostly daytime _ events.
   ``The longer presidents go without a press conference, the
greater the suspicion that there is something to hide, and the
greater the pressure becomes for holding press conferences,'' the
Harvard Commission on the Presidential News Conference said in a
report Wednesday.
   ``When, ultimately, the president holds a conference, it is
liable to be a hostile affair in which both the president and the
press look bad. It would seem better, on balance, for the president
to take his lumps on a more frequent basis.''
   Asked today to respond to the report's criticism of the
irregularity with which Reagan has held news conferences, White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the administration's
record. But he said, ``I don't think any president in good
conscience would ever commit to numbers on anything.''
   ``What I'm trying to say is that ... there is a diversity of
ways to communicate with the general public besides a press
conference,'' Fitzwater added. ``We've held the press conferences
that we think are appropriate. We've held other kinds of press
interviews that we think are useful, and in the final analysis, you
can be the judge.''
   The commission also said that reporters must behave better. The
public will quit paying attention if it believes reporters'
questions are unfair, irrelevant or overly aggressive, it said.
   The panel recommended that presidents meet with the media twice
a month during daytime hours and limit televised evening news
conferences to six a year.
   Daytime news conferences would ``reduce the temperature and
encourage more substantive and useful exchanges,'' the panel said.
   The 16-member commission, appointed by the Joan Shorenstein
Barone Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy of Harvard's
John F. Kennedy School of Government, was co-chaired by Marvin
Kalb, director of the center, and Frederick W. Mayer of Duke
University.
   The commission said the presidential press conference, a
75-year-old institution, ``is not aging well.''
   ``Once a forum for a vigorous exchange between the president and
the press, the institution has withered,'' the panel said. ``It is
now in a serious state of disrepair.''
   The commission gave this history of the institution:
   THEODORE ROOSEVELT: According to legend, he invited some
reporters who were waiting in the rain to come inside and hear him
out. The sessions, however, were not really news conferences: ``The
reporters simply stood and listened while the president talked to
them, often while being shaved by the White House barber.''
   WOODROW WILSON: He initiated the news conference. He felt
presidents should be obliged to answer reporters questions just as
British prime ministers field questions from the opposition in the
House of Commons.
   WARREN HARDING: Wilson's successor met with the press twice a
week for most of his presidency, but required that the questions be
submitted in advance in writing.
   CALVIN COOLIDGE: If he didn't like a written question, he'd
crumple it up and throw it away.
   HERBERT HOOVER: He met with reporters more than twice a week at
the start, but after the 1929 stock market crash, he held less
frequent, short and uninformative meetings.
   FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT: He met in warm sessions with reporters
almost twice a week for 13 years around his desk or, at Warm
Springs, Ga., around his car. He often flattered reporters,
impressed them with the depth of his knowledge, sometimes bullied
them, once sent a reporter to sit in the corner wearing a dunce
cap. He didn't insist on written questions, but sometimes put
answers off the record and usually could only be paraphrased by
reporters, not quoted directly.
   HARRY S. TRUMAN: He moved the press conference into a more
formal setting. Most of what he said was on the record, and
sometimes his spunky, spontaneous answers got him in trouble.
   DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER: He allowed television cameras in, changing
forever the nature of news conferences, although live telecasts
were not permitted.
   JOHN F. KENNEDY: His press conferences, marked by wit, ``became
the standard against which subsequent presidents would be judged _
or judge themselves.'' He had a briefing book prepared and
practiced answers.
   LYNDON JOHNSON: Kennedy was a tough act to follow, and Johnson,
to avoid questions when his Vietnam policy came under challenge,
took to making long opening statements. One study found his opening
statements consumed more than a third of the time.
   RICHARD NIXON. He averaged only six a year. During the Watergate
crisis, when he went for five months without a press conference,
the press became so hostile that he once stalked off without
awaiting the usual closing ``Thank you, Mr. President.''
   GERALD FORD: He ``had difficulty dampening the press cynicism
that had developed during the Johnson and Nixon administrations.''
   JIMMY CARTER: He kept to a two-a-month pledge for a year and a
half, but ended up averaging half that many, holding fewer during
the Iran hostage crisis. He moved them to the evening out of
frustration with the way the television news shows edited his
remarks at daytime news conferences.
   REAGAN: He pledged to hold news conferences once a month, but
has held only 45 in more than 7{ years in office and once let 5{
months pass without one. ``The president, although successful in
the short run in dodging difficult questions, suffers from the
perception that he is not really in charge of his own White House.''

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Thursday
reported progress toward 1990 goals for childhood immunization, but
said adults are not showing up as they should for their shots.
   Phil Horne, program management officer for the CDC's
immunization division, said the problem is especially acute among
the elderly.
   In its weekly report, the agency said 97 percent of the children
entering kindergarten in 1986 had been immunized against
diphtheria, measles, mumps, whooping cough, paralytic polio,
rubella and tetanus. The goal was 95 percent.
   The goal was 90 percent immunization against the same diseases
for children 2 and under. ``It appears likely that this objective
will not be met,'' the report said.
   It said measles outbreaks among preschoolers, although
stabilized in recent years, indicate the immunization level at that
age is inadequate.
   CDC figures show mumps in 1987 at the highest level since 1979,
with 12,848 cases. Illinois and Tennessee, which had the highest
number of cases, did not start enforcing laws requiring preschool
mumps immunization until 1987 and 1988 respectively.
   The report said the 1990 target for reductions in diphtheria and
polio appear to have been met and that there is substantial
progress toward goals for tetanus and rubella.
   ``School is the most forceful instrument we have now to assure
immunization,'' Horne said. ``But laws differ from state to state.
They are not consistent.''
   He said some states do not require some immunizations or may
exempt some students on medical or religious grounds.
   ``There is a general perception by the adult population that
immunizations are childhood activities,'' Horne said. ``There is a
feeling that if they were immunized as a child, they do not need to
be immunized as adults.''
   He said only about 20 percent of the target population for
influenza vaccines get the needed annual vaccinations and that
about 10 percent of the target group has the one-time-only
pneumonia shot.
   The target groups for both shots, he said, include people over
65 or adults with any debilitating illness.
   Horne said the National Coalition for Adult Immunizations,
formed out of concern for the adult vaccination figures, is trying
to get the word out through volunteer organizations and hopes to
include its pitch with Social Security checks.
   He said it is difficult to measure success.
   ``With school enterers we can require a statement of proof of
immunization for entry into school,'' he said. ``Most industries
would not require a similar statement, for example, for new
employees.''
   Vaccinations of target groups for hepatitis B, he said, range
from an estimated 5 percent to 40 percent to 50 percent, with the
high end including health care professionals such as dentists and
those who handle human blood products.
   The report identified users of illicit injectable drugs and
homosexual men as target populations less likely to be vaccinated.

   The Senate, beginning working on a $2.6
billion drug bill, today debated an effort by liberal senators to
strip a provision providing the death penalty for drug offenders
who kill.
   ``I don't believe our society should ever be one to say, `This
one lives and this one dies,''' said Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.,
the amendment's sponsor.
   Hatfield's proposal would substitute a mandatory life sentence
without possibility of parole for the death penalty. It would also
require mandatory life imprisonment for many violent drug offenses
for which the bill would impose 20-year sentences.
   Leaders of both parties seemed to have worked out a plan
allowing the chamber to begin shaping the bill into its final form.
Lawmakers held several meetings this morning to work out the final
problems.
   Democratic and Republican leaders reached agreement late
Wednesday on a procedure for winnowing a list of more than 100
amendments _ many of them controversial _ down to about 56. The
Senate was expected to decide whether to accept the plan today and,
if adopted, begin debating the legislation.
   Lawmakers who helped shape the formula warned that if the
procedure was not adopted, Congress might adjourn for the year
without drug legislation to show the voters.
   ``If people want to fight over the margins in the next few days,
we'll probably end up going home with nothing,'' said Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga.
   The bipartisan bill would authorize additional money for
federal, state and local law enforcement agencies and for alcohol
and drug abuse programs. Sixty percent of the money authorized by
the measure would be directed to treatment programs and 40 percent
would be for law enforcement.
   But the legislation lacks a mechanism to pay for the very
programs it would create. Lawmakers expect the government to be
able to scrape together $450 million to finance the measure during
the next year, far short of the $1.4 billion that would be needed
for that period.
   The bill also would allow capital punishment for some drug
offenders who commit murder, lengthen sentences for drug offenders
who commit violent crimes, and crack down on money laundering by
requiring better record-keeping by institutions that sell cashier's
and traveler's checks.
   With all 435 House seats and 33 Senate seats being contested
Nov. 8, legislators have been eager to adjourn for the year and
campaign with a tough drug measure to boast about. Congressional
leaders have been hoping to end the 100th Congress by Friday.
   But those plans _ and ultimate passage of the drug legislation _
have been jeopardized by amendments waiting in the wngs that were
likely to spark volatile debates.
   House leaders already have warned representatives to be prepared
to work next week. Senior members of the Senate told their
colleagues that the drug measure could be completed by Friday if
things go smoothly, or next week if disputes persist.
   ``If that's what senators want, that's all right with me,'' said
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``I'm not running this
year.''
   Under the agreement to pare down the list of amendments, about
30 of the proposals would be folded into the legislation. Those
would include provisions stiffening penalties for some drug
offenses, giving authorities more weapons for combating child
pornography, and making a newly created federal ``drug czar'' a
member of the White House National Security Council.
   A red-hot dispute over a proposal limiting the rights of
convicted criminals to appeal their sentences on procedural grounds
would be settled by having Congress revisit the issue next year.
   Eight other amendments would be voted on separately, including a
provision that is expected to lose that would eliminate the bill's
death penalty language.
   Eighteen other amendments would be considered if Senate leaders
from both parties agreed to put them to votes.
   The House on Sept. 22 passed a similar bill containing the death
penalty and many provisions eroding the rights of suspects in favor
of law enforcement authorities. President Reagan has said he
prefers the House legislation.
   Before the measure can be sent to the president for his
signature, the two chambers will have to fashion a compromise bill.

<HEAD>US Seeks $12 million From Chile in Letelier Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is asking the
government of Chile for $12 million in compensation for that
country's alleged role in a 1976 terrorist incident in Washington
that claimed the life of Chilean opposition leader Orlando Letelier.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said that since last
April, the United States has been pursuing claims against the
Chilean government filed by relatives of Letelier and of an aide
who was killed in the same incident, Ronni Karpen Moffitt.
   ``Their claims against the government of Chile for the deaths of
Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffitt are now as a matter of U.S.
international law considered the U.S. government's own claims,''
Redman said.
   ``Doing this is a serious step because it reflects a decision by
the U.S. government that the claims are meritorious and that the
failure to make compensation constitutes an injury to the United
States.''
   Redman said there was no breakdown on how much of the claim was
for the victims' relatives and how much for the U.S. government to
cover the cost of investigating the killings.
   Letelier and Ms. Moffitt died in a car bombing on Sept. 21,
1976, in Washington's fashionable Embassy Row section. It was one
of the most notorious politically motivated terrorist incidents in
U.S. history.
   Redman said he did not believe the Chilean government had
responded to the U.S. demand for compensation. However, The New
York Times, which disclosed the U.S. action in Thursday's editions,
said Chile had rejected the request because it denied
responsibility for the killings.
   The United States has maintained that the killings were carried
out by Chilean secret police agents.
   Letelier was Chile's ambassador to the United States under
President Salvador Allende, whose government was ousted in a 1973
military coup.
   Letelier, who also served as defense minister and foreign
minister, was detained by Chile's military authorities for an
extended period after the coup and was living in Washington at the
time of his death. He was an outspoken opponent of the military
government in his country.

   Mayor Pete Sferrazza says life in this 24-hour
city where divorces are easy and slot machines clang in both
casinos and supermarkets isn't as stressful as one researcher
claims.
   In fact, the twice-divorced and three-times married (twice to
the same woman) mayor says the high suicide, divorce, crime and
alcoholism rates that led to the title ``may be a measure of
release of stress.''
   ``I don't think it's an accurate picture of what life is like in
Reno,'' Sferrazza said of the ranking reported in Psychology Today.
``Living here, I know we have a small-town environment, and I know
it's far less stressful.''
   California psychologist Robert Levine reported in the November
issue of Psychology Today that Reno was the nation's most stressful
city and Las Vegas was right behind it, compared to 284 other
cities in the nation.
   Nevada Gov. Richard Bryan, who was born in Las Vegas, replied,
without a bit of stress in his voice, ``folks who reach that
conclusion need some counseling themselves.''
   ``People vote with their feet and tens of thousands of people
have moved to Nevada because of its beauty and many recreational
opportunities,'' he said.
   Levine counters: ``Moving to a new area often appeals to people
who are having trouble in their lives ... so they move to a place
where conditions are most attractive, bringing their pathology with
them and driving up the rates of divorce, suicide, alcoholism and
crime.''
   Pathology!
   ``That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard,'' said Tara
Hartsoch, who works in the promotions department of Harrah's Reno
hotel-casino. ``I've lived here five or six months and I think it's
very relaxed. Now Portland (Ore.) was stressful.''
   No, says lifelong Reno resident Sheryl Dembeck, Los Angeles is
much harder on the nerves than the Biggest Little City in the World.
   ``My husband lived in Los Angeles and he says he loves it here
in Reno because it's so calm,'' Mrs. Dembeck said. ``Sure, you've
got your 24-hour lifestyle and it can get fast-paced here. But then
you can go to the mountains or to the lake and get away.''
   Mrs. Dembeck works in the Washoe County clerk's office where all
local divorce filings are handled. The consensus from the nine
clerks is that divorce isn't always a stressful thing.
   ``Some of them are real happy about it,'' she said. ``But the
last time the mayor came in he seemed a little stressed, if you ask
me.''
   Levine, a psychology professor at California State
University-Fresno, said that failed marriages aside, Reno and Las
Vegas still top the list of stressful cities as far as
psychological well-being goes.
   ``Even without the divorce figures, which are inflated by the
presence of so many people who come to Nevada just to get a
divorce, the two cities would still be highest in overall
pathology,'' he said.
   Las Vegas Mayor Ron Lurie agreed that life can be stressful in
the gambling capital of the world, but ``I don't think we're any
different than any other city.''
   ``I'm stressed all the time,'' he said. ``I just work on nervous
energy. You have to have a good attitude about it.''
   According to Levine's survey, State College, Pa., was the least
stressful city in the nation.

<TEXT>
   Time and breathing room were running
out Thursday for three gray whales trapped in Arctic ice, and
biologists said they had been unable to contact an icebreaker to
give aid.
   The California gray whales apparently were swimming from the
Beaufort Sea to their winter grounds off the coast of Mexico when
they got caught in the ice east of Point Barrow a week ago, said
Geoff Carroll, a biologist for the North Slope Borough.
   He said the whales' movement kept open two holes about the size
of basketball courts about 450 feet offshore, but those openings
shrunk as temperatures plunged. On Wednesday, Barrow's minus 13 set
a record low for the date.
   A bowhead whale, larger and better adapted to ice than its gray
cousin, might break through the 6-inch ice, Carroll said. But he
held little hope for the trio of trapped mammals.
   ``Apparently, they got over into the Beaufort Sea and stayed too
long,'' he said.
   The borough's Department of Wildlife Management tried repeatedly
to get in touch with an ice-breaking vessel that a government
survey crew reported seeing from the air, but radio messages went
unanswered again today, biologists said.
   Another icebreaker, the Coast Guard's Polar Star, began working
its way to the Northwest Passage this week after ice off the
northern Alaska coast blocked the vessel's intended route to the
west. The Polar Star was too far from the whales to help them,
Coast Guard spokesman Andy Connor said Wednesday. The Coast Guard's
second icebreaker, the Polar Sea, is in port in Seattle.
   Carroll said the whales were stuck near Plover Point, a spit
extending southeast from Point Barrow. They appeared in the holes
about every four minutes, he said.
   ``They eat a lot and they have to keep moving,'' Carroll said.
``I'm sure they're going to eat everything that's there before very
long.'' He said the whales eat plankton from the ocean floor.
   The population of California gray whales has been expanding,
Carroll said, and in recent years the animals have been migrating
over a larger area. Near Point Barrow, the first gray whales of the
season usually are observed early in June, he said.
   The beluga and bowhead whales that also inhabit those waters
spend their winters in the Bering Sea, Carroll said.

   Ewing Kauffman, co-owner of the Kansas
City Royals and chairman of a pharmaceutical company, is sweetening
the pot for about 300 high school students he already has agreed to
send to college.
   Michael Herman, president of the Kauffman Foundation, announced
an added incentive for members of a freshman class who are enrolled
in Project Choice. The sweetener will pay each student $50 a
semester for attending classes regularly at Westport High School.
   ``If you're not in school then you can't become an academic
success,'' Herman told several hundred students and their parents
at the school Wednesday night. Many of the families are poor.
   Project Choice, started last spring and administered through the
foundation, guaranteed a college education for members of last
year's eighth-grade class at Westport Middle School who meet
requirements.
   Students must graduate from high school in four years, attend
school regularly and avoid parenthood and drug and alcohol abuse.
Parents must take an active part in their child's education.
   The foundation will pay tuition, fees, books and room and board
for college or vocational school.
   Kauffman, 72, founder and chairman of the board of Marion
Laboratories, recently made Forbes magazine's list of 400 richest
Americans. His net worth was listed at $740 million.

   Helen Hayes, known as the first lady of
American theater, got the gift of a drama scholarship fund in her
name for her 88th birthday.
   Friends of the actress, Col. Barney Oldfield and his wife, Vada,
said the fund, established in his will, will give $1,000 each year
to a student at the University of Nebraska. Miss Hayes' birthday
was Monday.
   Oldfield and Miss Hayes first worked together as judges for the
Great Steamboat Races on the Mississippi River in the early 1980s.
   ``She is the most remarkable woman, and happens to be a great
star, but she also is the kind of person who is an inspiration,''
said Oldfield, who graduated with his wife from the university in
1933.

   Ann Robinson is delighted the ``War Of The
Worlds'' television series that began this week has remained true
to some of the characters in the movie released 35 years ago.
   Robinson is playing Sylvia Van Buren just as she did in the
movie of the story of a deadly invasion by Martians that terrified
believing radio listeners 50 years ago.
   The makers of the series, a current-day version of the story,
didn't have to ask Robinson twice.
   ``I was thrilled to death,'' Robinson said recently from her
home in Los Angeles. ``When I was 5, my father and I listened to
``War Of The Worlds'' on the radio. In 1953, I got to star in the
movie and in 1988 I'm in the television series.''
   In the movie, Robinson was the love interest of Gene Barry, the
movie's star.
   In the series, her character was committed to a mental hospital
for the past 35 years because no one believed she had witnessed an
alien invasion. She escapes when she hears the aliens are back.

   West German actress Nastassja Kinski and her
family have been granted permission to live in Fribourg state in
Switzerland, a local official said Thursday. Geneva authorities
denied the request earlier.
   Jean-Pierre Gianini, head of the office for residence permits,
said they decided the actress would contribute to the local economy
and culture.
   Swiss newspapers reported Thursday that Ms. Kinski plans to
start a film production company in Fribourg, and to work on behalf
of the Swiss Red Cross.
   Geneva authorities this summer rejected Ms. Kinski's request,
saying there was no guarantee she would contribute to the local
economy. Swiss states are limited in the number of residence
permits they can grant to foreigners.
   Ms. Kinski is married to producer Ibrahim Moussa and has two
children.

   Was she or wasn't she is still an open question
in the latest bout between actress Robin Givens and heavyweight
boxing champ Mike Tyson.
   The actress has produced a letter from her doctor saying she
suffered a miscarriage in June during her second month of
pregnancy. It still leaves open the question of whether she was
pregnant when they married in February.
   Tyson is reportedly considering seeking an annulment on the
grounds that he married Givens believing she was pregnant when she
was not. Givens filed for divorce Oct. 7 in California, a community
property state.
   She initially hired California celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin
Mitchelson, but on Sunday switched to Manhattan lawyer Raoul Felder.
   Felder insisted Wednesday, when he released the letter, that
Givens is not merely seeking Tyson's assets, valued at $40 million.

   Actress Stephanie Zimbalist isn't sure she likes
the trappings of fame. One thing is sure _ she doesn't miss
co-starring in ``Remington Steele.''
   ``Believe me, I'm very grateful to `Remington,''' the
31-year-old actress said in an interview in the latest issue of US
magazine. ``But it makes my skin crawl when people tell me, `Don't
worry, you'll get another series.' Their expectations have little
to do with mine.''
   Ms. Zimbalist's latest acting job was in a made-for-television
movie, ``Agatha Christie's The Man in the Brown Suit.'' She
portrays, she said, a ``cheerful, vivacious and ... perky''
character who bears little resemblance to herself.
   Ms. Zimbalist, the daughter of actor Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and the
granddaughter of acclaimed violinist Efrem Zimbalist Sr. and opera
star Alma Gluck, concedes that she's in a bit of a ``trough.''
   ``It's just that I got so burned out on `Remington,''' she said.
``I got a real bad taste for acting and fame, especially. The cost
just seemed too high a price to pay.''

   Country singer Kenny Rogers, who says performing
on stage is addictive, hopes to stay hooked for as long as his
idol, Frank Sinatra.
   But at age 50, Rogers has decided to do it his way, which means
less touring, more time with his family and a new challenge _ a
one-hour talk-and-entertainment show on daytime television.
   ``Part of success for a man is knowing when you've done your
best and it's time to move on,'' Rogers said in an interview in the
November issue of McCall's magazine.
   Concert touring is a habit that's too hard to kick, he said, but
he wants to scale back. He wants more time for other things, but
also fears that fans ``have got to be getting sick of me.''
   For those who aren't, Rogers has a new album coming out in
January. And, he said, he'll keep singing for ``as long as anyone's
listening.''
   When in doubt, Rogers said, ``I've pulled back and said, `What
would Sinatra do?' There aren't many role models for people at my
level, and he's one of mine.''

   Officials from North and South Korea on
Thursday failed to agree on measures to reunite the peninsula and
ended a fifth round of talks with each side blaming the other for
the deadlock.
   After two hours of haggling at this truce village inside the
Demilitarized Zone separating their nations, delegates agreed to
meet again Nov. 17.
   ``The northern side took an insincere stand throughout, and
there was no progress,'' Lee Han-dong, a South Korean delegate and
parliamentarian, told a news conference after the meeting.
   Chon Kum Chol, the chief North Korean negotiator, said: ``The
South's position was basically the same as before, and they made no
concessions at all.''
   The two Koreas, meeting for the first time since the Olympics
ended Oct. 2 in Seoul, made some changes in their positions, but
neither side showed willingness to make major concessions.
   Delegates first shook hands over a new conference table and
exchanged small talk. Previously, the table was so wide they could
not reach across for handshakes.
   The cordial mood quickly dissipated as both sides exchanged
testy statements, accusing each other of insincere efforts to find
ways reunite the Korean Peninsula, which was divided in 1945.
   Thursday's meeting, the fifth since Aug. 21, was called to
prepare for proposed main talks between the Koreas' legislatures on
non-aggression and other peace measures.
   North Korea suggested the main talks include one-third of the
lawmakers from the North, or 218 people, and half of the South's
lawmakers, or 150 people. That was a change from previous meetings,
at which North Korea demanded a joint meeting of all the nearly
1,000 lawmakers of the two sides.
   South Korea wants a smaller meeting. It called for largely
ceremonial opening and closing sessions attended by all legislators
of both sides and a smaller session for the actual negotiations.
   The two sides differ widely over the proposed agenda.
   The communist North is putting more emphasis on a non-aggression
statement. Seoul officials say the statement seeks the withdrawal
from South Korea of 42,000 U.S. troops stationed there.
   The South wants to discuss the possibility of setting up a
summit between the nations' leaders. North Korean delegates oppose
this as an agenda item.
   The first talks were held Aug. 21. The sides began far apart and
neither has made significant concessions. At the fourth session
Aug. 26, both sides blamed each other for blocking progress but
agreed to meet again after the Olympics.
   North Korea accused South Korea on Thursday of ``having left a
stain on the nation's history by hosting the Olympics alone in
Seoul.''
   ``The Olympics are supposed to be a festival of peace and good
will,'' Chon said. By having the Olympics alone, he said South
Korea ``split the nation.''
   North Korea wanted to share the Olympics, but the International
Olympic Committee said the Games are awarded to a single city and
cannot be shared.

   A $1.5 million exhibit at the site of the

   Fund-raising and construction is nearly complete and details of
the exhibit and historical display will be announced Nov. 22, the

chairwoman of the Dallas County Historical Foundation.
   The exhibit will be on the sixth floor of the Dallas County

as the Texas Schoolbook Depository in 1963 when Kennedy was shot as
he rode in a motorcade just outside the building.
   The Warren Commission determined that Lee Harvey Oswald fired
the shots from the sixth floor of the building.
   Ms. Adams said patrons will enter the building through a new
ground-level visitors center and ride an elevator to the exhibit
featuring films, videos and information about Kennedy's life and
the 1960s. The display opens Feb. 20, 1989.

accounts and off-shore shell companies that were conduits for
millions of dollars generated by the arms deals, according to court
papers.
   Zucker, a U.S. citizen who has lived in Switzerland for 20
years, operates a financial consulting business in Geneva that has
long overseen Hakim's banking interests in that country.
   A former Internal Revenue Service lawyer, Zucker has received
immunity from prosecution for his role in the Iran-Contra affair,
and is listed as a prospective witness by independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh.
   Zucker's business, Compagnie de Services Fiduciares, S.A. (CSF),
kept the financial records of the arms deals and set up a series of
dummy corporations and Swiss bank accounts for the arms
transactions.
   Hakim had ``long utilized the services of Mr. Zucker and CSF in
the conduct of his legal and business affairs,'' defense lawyers
said. ``In so doing, he has often entered into confidential
communications with Mr. Zucker for the purpose of securing both
opinions on law and legal services.''
   ``Mr. Zucker is a member of the bar who rendered legal services
to Mr. Hakim, and Mr. Hakim has insisted that all communications
with respect to those services remain confidential,'' defense
lawyers N. Richard Janis and Lawrence H. Wechsler said in a
pleading that was ordered unsealed Wednesday by U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell.
   An accounting of the information Zucker provided Walsh ``may
well result in the suppression of any effort by the government to
introduce at any trial either the testimony of Mr. Zucker or any
information derived directly or indirectly from government contacts
with Mr. Zucker'' Hakim's lawyers said.
   Defense lawyers threatened to try to prevent Zucker from
testifying not only against Hakim but his three co-defendants in
the Iran-Contra conspiracy case: former national security adviser
John M. Poindexter, ex-White House aide Oliver L. North and Hakim's
former business partner, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord.
   The four are charged with conspiring to defraud the government
by diverting profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sale to the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   Separate trials have been ordered for each defendant.
   Prosecutors said in a pleading filed Thursday they were ready to
begin North's trial in January. They opposed further delays in
pre-trial proceedings sought by North, contending the defense was
merely trying to delay the trial.
   Zucker's testimony would provide key evidence against all four
defendants about the clandestine network of Swiss bank accounts and
off-shore dummy corporations through which arms-sale profits were
diverted to the Contras.
   His testimony would also support a charge that Hakim and Secord
conspired to pay illegal gratuities to North, including the
creation of a $200,000 investment account at CSF and the
installation of a $13,800 security fence around the former White
House aide's home in Great Falls, Va.
   Zucker, an unindicted co-conspirator in this count of the
indictment, met with North's wife, Elizabeth, in Philadelphia in
March 1986 and later with Washington attorney David Lewis, the
indictment says.
   Lewis told congressional investigators that Zucker wanted him to
pass money to Mrs. North that would be disguised as compensation
for her role in a real estate deal. Lewis, who declined to become
involved, testified that Zucker told him the money was owed North.

<TEXT>
   Police today arrested a teen-ager and
charged him with setting one of two dozen fires that have plagued
the White Mountain area recently. The arrest came one day after a
former firefighter was accused in several other blazes.
   Lawrence Coulter Jr., 19, of Jefferson, was charged with setting
a fire earlier this month at a vacation home in Dalton, two towns
away from Jefferson, the scene of most of the fires, police said.
   Someone at a neighboring home saw a man walking from the house
about the time of the fire and took down the man's license plate
number, but state Police Lt. Gary Sloper declined to say if the
plate was traced to Coulter.
   On Wednesday, police charged Lance Lalumiere, 23, of Jefferson
with setting one fire in Jefferson and said they will seek
indictments charging him with 15 others. LaLumiere was charged with
setting fire to his brother's house in August.
   Jefferson has been plagued by 21 arson fires since May. During
the period, there have been at least three suspicious fires in
nearby towns _ the one Coulter is charged with setting and two in
August in Lancaster.
   Despite Lalumiere's arrest, Jefferson residents are doubtful
their siege is over.
   ``We'll sit up at night 'til we hear more. We'll go on the way
we have been,'' said Donna Hartford, whose family narrowly escaped
a fire that destroyed their home in July.
   ``This is at least something. They have done something, but I
don't feel comfortable.''
   Her unease was echoed by others in the community of 850, and
Sloper said five of the town's 21 suspicious or confirmed arson
fires apparently were set by someone other than Lalumiere.
   No one has been killed or seriously injured in the fires that
have blackened pockets of Jefferson's 52 square miles of scenic
meadows, woods and hills. But there have been close calls among the
village's 363 residences.
   The fires began with a grass fire on May 5; a barn was the next
target, and by late May the first occupied building had been struck.
   As the toll of destruction mounted, many families began sleeping
in shifts and abandoned vacation plans. Some residents began night
patrols. Police feared vigilante violence. One child packed all her
precious possessions and mailed them to relatives in other states,
afraid her home would be next to burn.
   Sloper said Lalumiere, a restaurant dishwasher, had been a
suspect for some time.
   ``It's taken a great deal of time and effort to ... make sure
(we had) more than a reasonable amount of evidence to present,'' he
said.
   Lalumiere reported the fire at his brother's home and was there
trying to put it out when firefighters arrived, authorities said.
The fire damaged the front of the building.
   Lalumiere was asked to resign from the fire department after he
moved to another town briefly. Jefferson requires volunteer
firefighters to live within its borders.
   He entered no plea during his arraignment in Lancaster, routine
in felony cases in New Hampshire. He was being held in Belknap
County jail in lieu of $50,000 cash bail.
   But in an interview two days after the fire at his brother's
house, Lalumiere told the weekly Coos County Democrat: ``All I
tried to do was save my brother's house and this is the thanks I
get.''
   ``I have nothing to hide,'' he added.
   Despite the dramatic news, many residents said their fears and
doubts remain.
   Some townspeople who know Lalumiere said they do not believe he
is capable of single-handedly setting the fires and eluding the
elaborate police surveillance in the town since summer.
   Also, some point out that at least two fires occurred after
Lalumiere was under constant police surveillance.
   ``Explain the two fires that happened after Lance was under
24-hour surveillance,'' Hartford said. ``We've all been up today,
thinking there might be something more than (Lalumiere's arrest),
but now it's kind of blah.''
   Lalumiere has been staying at a motel in Jefferson since August.
William Perkins, who has lived there since his home burned in May,
said he also doubts Lalumiere is involved.
   ``I think they've got the wrong fish in a cage,'' Perkins said.
   Lalumiere's parents, who live in Jefferson, did not answer
knocks at their door Wednesday afternoon.
   One resident who spoke under condition of anonymity out of fear
of reprisals, said she would not rest easy until every fire is
explained and every arsonist convicted.
   ``Until then,'' she said, ``I leave my light on and I'm going to
stay up with a gun.''

<HEAD>Shroud Debunked as Christ's Burial Cloth, But Mystery Remains</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TURIN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Shroud of Turin is only about 700 years
old and cannot be the authentic burial cloth of Jesus Christ as
believed by millions over the centuries, the archbishop of Turin
said Thursday.
   Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero's announcement that he accepted
the results of dating tests conducted by three laboratories ended a
debate over the origin of the cloth that has raged for hundreds of
years.
   But another mystery remains unsolved: how the shroud came to
bear the image of what scientists have called a real human form of
a whipped and crucified man.
   Rejecting attempts to brand the shroud a fake, Ballestrero
stressed that for the Roman Catholic church, the linen cloth
remains a venerated object and a powerful symbol of faith.
   ``The church believes in the image and not in the history,
because this image of Jesus Christ is very interesting and the
people believe very much in Jesus,'' he said.
   Ballestrero told a news conference at the headquarters of his
archdiocese that carbon-14 tests by labs in the United States,
Britain and Switzerland concluded with 95 percent accuracy that the
shroud cannot be more than 728 years old, dating to between 1260
and 1390.
   ``I see no reason for the church to put these results in
doubt,'' the cardinal said.
   The Vatican's official newspaper L'Osservatore Romano did not
comment on the announcement, but printed the text of the cardinal's
statement on page two.
   Vatican Radio, in reporting the news, said ``The chapter is not
closed,'' noting that the problems of the image on the cloth still
remain.
   Although the church has never claimed it as a holy relic, the
shroud has been revered for centuries by millions who believed it
was the actual cloth that Christ was wrapped in after he died on
the cross. Others called it a clever forgery.
   The sheet _ 14 feet, 3 inches long and 3 feet, 7 inches wide _
bears a faint, yellowish negative image of the front and back of a
man with a thorn mark on the head, lacerations from flogging on the
back, and bruises on the shoulders.
   For years, church officials refused to let scientists study the
cloth.
   U.S. scientists who subjected it to rigorous chemical, computer
and photographic analysis in 1981 concluded that it was ``a real
human form of a whipped and crucified man and not the product of an
artist.''
   Luigi Gonella, scientific adviser to the cardinal, said the
American scientists found the image resulted from chemical changes
in the linen while it was in contact with the body.
   Gonella said the church was particularly angered by claims that
since the shroud dates to medieval times it must be a fake.
   ``A forgery means it was made for the specific purpose of
deceiving people,'' Gonella said. ``This is possible but there is
no proof of that. It could be a medieval icon. We don't even know
how it was made.''
   ``Believers will be hurt much more by the comments about the
results than by the results themselves,'' Gonella added.
   Pope John Paul II finally gave the go-ahead for testing in 1986.
   In April, the shroud was taken from its red silk wrapping inside
a silver chest on an altar in Turin's cathedral. Postage-sized
samples of the cloth were snipped off for the carbon-14 testing.
   Carbon-14 is widely used to date archaeological finds. It is a
radioactive isotope whose half-life _ the time required for
disintegration of half its atoms _ is known. Thus the amount of
carbon-14 present in an object can reveal its approximate age.
   The laboratories that conducted the tests were at the University
of Arizona; the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology at the
University of Zurich; and Oxford University. All dated the shroud
to between 1260 and 1390, Gonella said.
   Ballestrero said church officials in Turin received official
results from the three labs on Sept. 28 and delivered them
personally to the Vatican the next day. Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro flanked the cardinal at the news conference.
   Witnesses from as far back as the 12th century reported seeing
the shroud in the imperial palace at Constantinople. The trail was
then lost until more than a hundred years later in 1354, when the
shroud was traced to Lirey, France.
   The cloth arrived in Turin in 1578, and has remained in its
silver chest here ever since. King Umberto II of Italy bequeathed
it to the pope upon his death in 1983.
   The shroud has occupied public attention so much it was even the
subject of a 1986 Broadway musical. The show, called ``Into the
Light,'' opened to negative reviews and closed after a week.

<HEAD>Dukakis Hoping to Gain in Debate; Bush Looks to Protect Lead</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Debate begins at 9 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush and Michael Dukakis polished
their lines one final time Thursday in advance of their prime-time
debate, the Republican looking to protect his lead in the polls and
the Democrat hoping for a breakthrough to transform the
presidential race in its final weeks.
   There was no underestimating the stakes as the two would-be
presidents pointed toward their 90-minute, 9 p.m. EDT face-off on
the UCLA campus, their second and final debate of the campaign.
   Pre-debate polls gave Bush a narrow lead among voters nationwide
with a little less than four weeks remaining to the election.
State-by-state breakdowns indicated the vice president's Electoral
College advantage was more formidable, although several large
battleground states _ enough to tip the balance of the election _
appeared unsettled.
   Debate sponsors were looking for a television audience in the
tens of millions for the second and final clash between the
Republican vice president and the Democratic governor of
Massachusetts.
   The audience included vice presidential candidates Lloyd Bentsen
and Dan Quayle, who held their only debate of the campaign eight
days ago in Omaha, Neb.
   The debate scenery, a red-carpeted stage, with a blue backdrop
and oak lecterns, was the same one used in the first Bush-Dukakis
debate in North Carolina last month and again in the vice
presidential debate in Nebraska. This time it was uncrated and
erected in Pauley Pavilion, home of the UCLA basketball team.
   The format for evening was identical to that of the earlier
clashes, with the candidates responding to questions from a panel
of reporters, but having no formal opportunity to question each
other.
   The panelists were moderator Bernard Shaw of Cable News Network,
Andrea Mitchell of NBC, Ann Compton of ABC and Margaret Warner of
Newsweek magazine.
   Neither Bush nor Dukakis campaigned during the day, although
both met with aides and arranged to view the debate set a few hours
before the event began.
   Dukakis took his customary morning ``power walk,'' with hand
weights. Bush planned no pre-debate events outside his hotel other
than his private walkthrough at the debate site.
   Meanwhile, Bentsen spent the morning in Washington, urging his
colleagues in Congress to get behind the national ticket. ``I was
asking for their support and commitment and their leadershiop in
their own states and we had a very enthusiastic meeting,'' he said
after meeting in closed session with Democratic members of the
Senate.
   Quayle, who campaigned in three states, took time out to
telephone Bush with his advice: ``Hit it over centerfield.''
   From both campaigns the word was that the biggest task of the
two presidential candidates in their final debate was to define
where they would lead the country.
   Bush said Wednesday he wanted to help Americans ``understand
what my heartbeat is, what I really care about.''
   Dukakis said, ``One of the nice things about debates is they get
people out from behind the balloons and out of the flag factory and
it gets them to address the issues.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas offered Dukakis advice from a
distance: Get rid of his slick television commercials and talk
straight to the voters.
   ``He's got to seize every opportunity that he has, be on any
talk show he can be on, get rid of these commercials that try to
hawk the candidate and party like toothpaste and soap flakes,''
said Wright.
   The Commission on Presidential Debates took over sponsorship of
the encounter after the League of Women Voters abruptly backed out
after complaining that the candidates had refused to relinquish
control over such details as the format and membership of the panel
of questioners.
   Repeated national opinion surveys have said a majority of voters
question Quayle's qualifications to succeed to the presidency and
suggest the Indiana senator could cost the Republican ticket votes
on Nov. 8.
   But a Washington Post-ABC state-by-state survey of 10,000 likely
voters, made public on the eve of the debate, said Bush led solidly
in 21 states with a total of 220 electoral votes _ just 50 short of
the total needed to win. Dukakis was firmly ahead in only three
states with 30 electoral votes. The survey was conducted over a
three-week period beginning Sept. 21.
   Debate preparations for Bush and Dukakis followed the same
pattern they used before their first confrontation at Wake Forest
University in Winston-Salem, N.C.
   Dukakis rehearsed with Washington attorney Robert Barnett acting
as a stand-in for Bush.
   Former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman took the role of
Dukakis during the Bush preparations.

<HEAD>Author of Banned Book Sends Critical Letter To Gandhi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A novelist whose latest book was banned
in India accused the government of bowing to religious
fundamentalists and denounced the ban in an angry letter to Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   Indian newspapers on Thursday published Salman Rushdie's letter,
which urged a lifting of the ban on ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Rushdie, 41, is a British citizen of Indian descent and lives in
London. He won the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious
literary award, for his first book, ``Midnight's Children,'' a
broad satire on post-independence India.
   ``Satanic Verses'' has also been nominated for the Booker Prize,
which is announced Oct. 25. Rushdie's second novel, ``Shame,''
earned wide acclaim.
   ``Satanic Verses'' was banned Oct. 5 after complaints from
Moslem members of Parliament. They said they feared Moslem
militants might use the book to incite communal riots.
   The book is sharply critical of religious fundamentalism and
makes veiled references of the prophet Mohammed and the Koran, the
sacred book of Moslems.
   The complicated story, which mixes elements of realism and
fantasy, focuses on two Indian characters. The benevolent one acts
as a messenger for Mohammed, the founder of the Islamic religion.
The other is satanic and manipulative.
   In the letter carried on the front pages of major Indian daily
newspapers, Rushdie accused Gandhi of denying the right to free
expression at the behest of religious fundamentalists.
   ``The right to freedom of expression is at the very foundation
of any democratic society, and at present, all over the world,
Indian democracy is becoming something of a laughingstock,''
Rushdie wrote.
   ``When ... self-appointed guardians of Muslim sensibilities say
that no civilized society should permit the publication of a book
like mine, they have got things backwards. The question raised by
the book's banning is precisely whether India, by behaving in this
somewhat South African fashion, can any more lay claim to the title
of civilized society,'' the author said.
   The prime minister was touring northern India on Thursday and
his office had no comment on Rushdie's letter.
   The ban has been widely criticized in India and abroad. Indian
newspapers have been particularly outspoken.
   The conservative daily, The Hindu, criticized the ban as a
``Philistine decision'' while the anti-government Indian Express
called it ``thought control.''
   Under the ban, the Ministry of Finance barred importation of the
book or sale of it. There was no hearing before the decision was
made.
   In an interview published Thursday in The New York Times,
Rushdie said, ``The idea that the Minister of Finance should decide
what books should be read and not be read is not acceptable in a
free country.''
   ``It seems to me that the government has grown very week in
India while the power of religious extremists seems to have grown
very strong,'' he was quoted as saying. ``The book is not the
issue. This is an attempt to manipulate the government.''
   ``The Satanic Verses'' was published Sept. 22 in Britain and is
scheduled to be published in the United States in February.
   Six people, including playwright Tom Stoppard and novelist
Kingsley Amis, signed a telegram to Gandhi protesting the ban.
   The protest telegram, which was sent last week, said: ``We
consider that the banning of a serious work of literature
represents a very grave threat to freedom of expression in your
country, and strongly urge you to ensure that the ban is lifted.''
   The other signers were poet Stephen Spender; Philip Spender and
Sally Laird, the director and editor, respectively, of Index on
Censorship, a British-based journal on free speech issues; and
Kevin Boyle, director of Article 19, a second anti-censorship
organization.

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito's jaundice worsened Thursday, and
doctors gave him another blood transfusion to fight his anemia,
court officials said.
   Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda said the
87-year-old emperor discharged more blood. Two court physicians
were spending Thursday night watching over the world's oldest
living monarch.
   Doctors say Hirohito's enlarged pancreas apparently has blocked
his bile duct, sending bile into his bloodstream and causing
jaundice.
   The emperor's kidney and liver functions also appeared to be
worsening, news reports said.
   With the 0.4-pint transfusion Thursday, Hirohito has received
more than 15{ pints of blood since his condition worsened 24 days
ago.
   Court officials have not confirmed or denied reports that he has
cancer in the area of his upper intestine.
   Officials of the governing Liberal Democratic Party said Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita would resume trips outside of Tokyo to
campaign for a tax reform plan, Kyodo News Service reported.
   Takeshita suspended the trips after Hirohito's condition became
serious, but decided to resume them next week because his condition
apparently stabilized, Kyodo said.
   Concerts, festivals, political meetings, sports meets and other
events have been canceled because of Hirohito's illness. Some
Japanese have criticized the cancellations as an overreaction.
   Some courses at Tohoku University in Sendai in the northwest
were canceled Thursday after about 50 students built barricades and
began a strike. They said Hirohito's illness was being used to
build sympathy for and strengthen the imperial system, Kyodo said.
   Some Japanese fear a strengthened imperial system could bring a
resurgence of the nationalism and militarism that characterized
Japan during World War II.
   The militarists who controlled Japan during the war used
Hirohito's name to rally public support for Japan's invasion of
other Asian countries.
   Japan's postwar constitution defines the emperor as ``the symbol
of the state'' and gives him no real political power.

   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping said Thursday that a
summit ending China's nearly 30-year estrangement from the Soviet
Union could be held in 1989, Finland's foreign minister reported.
   The minister, Kalevi Sorsa, said Deng made the comment in a
meeting with visiting Finnish President Mauno Koivisto.
   In a statement to The Associated Press and in comments at a news
conference in the northern Chinese city of Xian, where he flew from
Beijing, Sorsa revised his earlier report that Deng said a summit
would be held in 1989.
   He said Deng told the Finnish delegation that if the upcoming
visit to Moscow by Chinese Foreign Qian Qichen goes well, ``there
might be a summit next year.''
   Despite the qualification, Deng's statement was the first time a
Chinese leader speculated publicly on the date for a summit. It was
the most positive in a series of increasingly optimistic remarks by
Chinese officials on chances for normalization of relations between
the two Communist giants.
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is ready to meet with China's leader
``anytime, any place'' but no date has been fixed yet.
   Gerasimov indicated the Soviets had agreed in principle to a
meeting with the Chinese leadership, and said they had sought such
a meeting for some time.
   ``Our suggestion was to have the Sino-Soviet summit some time
ago. Obviously we suggested it be held anytime, any place,''
Gerasimov said. ``As to when and where it would be held, it has yet
to be dealt with.''
   China and the Soviet Union were close allies in the 1950s, but
split in the early 1960s over ideological and strategic differences.
   China announced last month that Qian would visit Moscow this
year for talks that could clear the way for normalized relations.
The exact date has not been set for what will be the first working
visit of a Chinese foreign minister to Moscow in 32 years.
   The last Chinese-Soviet summit was in 1959, when Nikita S.
Khrushchev visited Mao Tse-tung in Beijing. Among other things, Mao
was angered by the Soviet assumption that it should dictate policy
to China as a ``big brother'' in revolution.
   The official Chinese news agency, Xinhua, said in its report on
the Deng-Koivisto meeting that Deng stipulated relations with
Moscow could not return to the alliance of the 1950s, with Moscow
in a dominant position.
   Xinhua did not mention Deng's comments on a possible summit.
   China long has said there are three obstacles to normal
relations with the Soviet Union: the Soviet troop presence in
Afghanistan, the heavy Soviet troop concentration in Mongolia on
China's border, and Soviet-allied Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia.
   The Soviets pulled some troops out of Mongolia in 1987 and began
to withdraw from Afghanistan this year. An official in the Finnish
delegation said Deng reitered in his meeting with Koivisto that
Cambodia is now the main obstacle.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Deng did
not comment on the status of Chinese-Soviet talks on Cambodia.
Premier Li Peng said in September that the two sides were
``relatively close'' but still had points of disagreement.
   Vietnam invaded neighboring Cambodia in 1978 and ousted the
Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge. It maintains an estimated 120,000
troops there to support the government it set up under Heng Samrin
and battle Chinese-aided Cambodian guerrillas.
   China maintains that Vietnam could not continue its occupation
without Soviet financial help.
   Finnish officials said Deng did not discuss where a summit would
be held. Beijing is considered the likely venue because Deng, 84,
no longer travels abroad. He has retired from most of his party and
government posts but still retains final authority in setting
policy behind the scenes.

   Professors and students at the
University of Zimbabwe joined forces Thursday to protest alleged
police brutality against anti-government demonstrators and the
expulsion of a Kenyan.
   The political science department issued a statement supporting
the faculty of the law school, which earlier this week denounced
police action during student protests in September and called for a
review of the deportation on Friday of Shadrack Gutto, a
Kenyan-born lecturer at the school.
   Hundreds of riot police with dogs, batons and tear gas broke up
the Sept. 29 demonstrations by thousands of university students
protesting alleged government corruption in Zimbabwe.
   Hospital officials said scores of police and students were
injured in clashes and more than 480 people were arrested in the
bloodiest violence since Zimbabwe won its independence from Britain
in 1980. Students said police attacked them without warning.
   On Oct. 6, the Home Affairs Ministry gave Gutto 48 hours to
leave the country. The Kenyan, who for six years taught at the law
school and advocated radical socialist policies, was accused of
being an illegal immigrant. He flew to London on Friday.
   The political science faculty said in Thursday's statement they
were ``greatly disturbed'' at police treatment of student
demonstrators and Gutto's deportation ``without due process.''
   The president of the University's Students Representative
Council, Edgar Mwembwe, said Thursday that police attacks on
protesters were like ``police brutality in South Africa.''
   On Wednesday, the law school faculty issued a statement
protesting police behavior and requesting a meeting with President
Robert Mugabe to discuss the expulsion of Gutto. Some students and
professors said they believed the Kenyan was kicked out because
authorities believed he fanned the unrest.
   Mugabe has defended his government against corruption charges,
saying there was no evidence justifying the protests.
   Students and lecturers have been major supporters of Mugabe's
Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front) and its
socialistic policies since the president led Zimbabwe to
independence on April 18, 1980.
   But student leader Mwembwe said the demonstrations were ``not
the end but just the beginning of what is to come _ the capaign
against corruption, negligence of duty, betrayal and paying of lip
service to the goals and aspirations the nation has set towards
socialism.''
   He insisted no faculty members, including Gutto, were involved
in the September protests.

<HEAD>Aquino Says Government Will File Charges Against Marcos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>

   President Corazon Aquino said
Thursday the government will charge Ferdinand Marcos with crimes
allegedly committed during his 20 years as president.
   Mrs. Aquino also said Marcos, who fled to exile in Hawaii in
1986, will be allowed to return to the Philippines to answer the
charges. Philippine law prohibits criminal trials in absentia.
   ``Sometime in the future, we will file a criminal case or cases
against Mr. Marcos,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``At that time, we will
have to allow him to return to face the trial. No definite time
frame can be given as of now for this.''
   She issued the statement one day after a Filipino official
indicated her government may delay filing charges against the
ousted president until U.S. authorities decide whether to prosecute
him.
   The Philippine government claims Marcos and his associates stole
up to $10 billion before his administration was toppled in the 1986
uprising that swept Mrs. Aquino to power.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that the U.S. State
Department's legal officer, Abraham Sofaer, recommended that U.S.
authorities allow Marcos to surrender millions of dollars he
allegedly embezzled in return for avoiding prison.
   The plea bargain proposal reportedly involves an investigation
of Marcos by U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani in New York into
alleged illegal money transfers and other activities.
   On Wednesday, Mateo Caparas, chairman of the Philippines'
Presidential Commission on Good Government, said Marcos simply
wants to return to the Philippines to evade prosecution in the
United States.
   Caparas, who said he was speaking for Mrs. Aquino, said the
government would not permit filing of charges here ``to be used as
an excuse by Mr. Marcos to escape his indictment abroad.''
   Caparas' commission is in charge of recovering money allegedly
taken by Marcos.
   In other developments, the military said two Filipino guards at
the U.S.-run Clark Air Base were killed and another wounded in a
shootout with police outside the facility.
   Police said the shooting erupted late Wednesday about 100 yards
from the main gate of Clark Air Base after a city patrolman noticed
three passengers in a jeep who appeared to be carrying concealed
weapons.
   The patrolman reported the sighting to a passing patrol car,
which stopped to search the passengers. The guards, who were in
civilian clothes, drew pistols and shooting broke out, the report
said.
   It was unclear from the report who fired first.
   The dead were identified as Philippine Air Force Sgt. Ramon
Estrada and Sgt. Carlos Bellan, who were assigned to the Clark Air
Base Command, a Filipino unit which provides security at the
installation.
   The wounded sergeant, also assigned to the command, was
identified as Henry Bernal. He was taken to a hospital on the base.

   Independent Czech journalists have set up
a committee to support a Catholic publisher jailed by authorities
for circulating underground litererature, an emigre source reported
Thursday.
   A group of 88 publishers and journalists signed an appeal for
Ivan Polansky that was published in Prague on Wednesday, according
to the London-based Palach Press, an independent publisher of news
on Czechoslovakia.
   The Supreme Court of the republic of Slovakia on Aug. 30 upheld
a four-year sentence against Polansky, 52, a Catholic activist,
saying he was guilty of ``subversive activity,'' the state news
agency CTK reported.
   ``Independent publishing is a legitimate act of civil defense
against the rulers' total manipulation of society,'' the statement
was quoted as saying.
   ``We cannot and will not be silent over the fact that Ivan
Polansky has, in a way, been sent to prison and serves his sentence
for us all,'' the committee said.

   A display of 1,000 Soviet books at a superpower
book swap, featuring everthing from Russian science fiction to
``Dr. Zhivago,'' represents a new chapter in literary glasnost,
organizers said Thursday.
   The display, ``The U.S.S.R.: Perestroika and Glasnost,'' has
drawn a steady stream of browsers curious about life and literature
in the Soviet Union, said Evgueny G. Semenikhin, who is traveling
with the exhibit.
   Included are works by Boris Pasternak, whose classic ``Dr.
Zhivago,'' was banned for many years in the Soviet Union.
   ``For our country which was closed, so to say, for a long time
this process has a tremendous influence on the whole population of
the country and especially the creative intelligencia,'' Semenikhin
said.
   Perestroika, or restructuring, refers to economic and political
reforms instigated by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Glasnost
describes a new policy of government self-criticism and openness in
expression.
   Soviet literature still carries the Iron Curtain-image of
propaganda-laden tomes and censorship, but glasnost has changed
that, said Semenikhin, deputy chief of the Soviet State Committee
for Publishing and Printing. The committee and the U.S. Information
Agency are co-sponsors of the exchange.
   ``I am in book publishing for about 15 years and I think that
censorship exists everywhere, including the U.S., because here you
have economic censorship. It still exists (in the USSR) but now
it's absolutely incomparable with what it was two to three years
ago,'' he said.
   Georgy Ginzburg, an art photographer and publisher also
traveling with the exhibit, pointed to Pasternak's books and other
previously banned novels as tangible evidence of glasnost.
   ``They're publishing all of this which was under the table,'' he
said.
   Many notable works, however, remain under the table, such as
Alexander Solzhenitsyn's ``The Gulag Archipelago.''
   Glasnost also has opened doors for artists, Ginzburg said.
   ``We have a group of artists who used to be considered
non-conformists. Now we're publishing books on these new artists,''
he said.
   Marshall Goldman, associate director of Harvard University's
Russian Research Center, called the exchange an interesting
development.
   ``In the old days you would have these exchanges and it would be
mostly propaganda. That's different now, there's some substance,''
he said.
   ``I think they're doing it for an ulterior motive and that's to
get money (by selling publishing rights), but that's good,''
Goldman said. He said he recently visited Moscow and learned of
plans to open a bookstore selling Western novels for rubles, a
departure from the current practice of selling them for hard-to-get
American dollars.
   ``We're talking about some very interesting things,'' he said.
   The U.S. side of the superpower book swap is called
``Many-Booked America'' and is a big success in Minsk, Semenikhin
said.
   He said there are no official visitor tallies, but interest has
been constant at the Soviet exhibit, which opened at the Boston
Public Library Tuesday after a visit in Washington D.C. The exhibit
makes a final stop in Los Angeles Oct. 31-Nov. 11.
   Thursday morning, about a dozen people circulated through the
racks of books in Russian and English, looking through the hundreds
of titles.
   John Connolly of South Boston, making his second trip to the
exhibit, said he was impressed by the diversity.
   ``When you read what books they have to offer, they're no
different. The people are the same, it's just the governments that
are antagonistic,'' he said.
   ``I just hope it keeps up because this being on the edge of war
is not very good,'' Connolly said.
   Books on display include the American classics of Mark Twain and
James Fenimore Cooper as well as books on religion, politics,
science, sport and children's stories.
   ``The range is great,'' said Jane Manthorne, assistant director
of the library. She said there has been no protest from Boston's
sizable dissident community, although one man handed a library
official a cryptic note referring to torture in the Soviet Union.
   ``Maybe the idea of glasnost is convincing even the
dissidents,'' she said.

   The unemployment rate in Britain was 8 percent in
September, down from 9.8 percent in the same month of 1987.
   An estimated 2,266,900 people were unemployed last month, less
than the 2,772,200 people who were out of work in September 1987,
the Department of Employment reported.
   It said the number of people unemployed last month was less than
the reported figure, which was swollen by a postal strike that
prevented people from notifying the department they had found work.

<HEAD>Horse Deaths Raise Fear of Epidemic In Spain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-three horses have died recently in
the southern region of Andalusia, prompting fears of an epidemic
that could force a change of venue of the equestrian events at the
1992 Olympic Games.
   The Agriculture Ministry said Thursday that scores of sick
horses have been tested to see if they have African horse sickness,
but results are not expected until next week. If they are found to
have the disease, it would be the second outbreak in 14 months in
Spain.
   The ministry said the government has taken the precaution of
importing 7,500 doses of vaccine for African horse sickness from
South Africa, where the illness is endemic.
   Gerard de las Casas, a government health official from
Andalusia, said preliminary tests of 150 sick horses turned up
negative results for the disease, but he said the horses are so
sick they will have to be put to death.
   De las Casas said the regional government has prohibited entry
into southern Spain of horses from North Africa as well as the
movement of all horses within the Andalusian region.
   African horse sickness is also known as equine plague. It is a
viral disease transmitted by insects. Symptoms include fever and
fluid retention, and death may occur quickly from fluid-filled
lungs. There is no known cure, but vaccinations have proved
effective.
   The Madrid daily El Pais quoted a Spanish Olympic Committee
official as saying that another outbreak of the illness could
result in Spain being cited as a country where the disease is
endemic.
   The 1992 Summer Olympic Games are to be held in Barcelona.
   The official, who was not identified, was quoted as saying that
an outbreak could force the equestrian events to be held elsewhere,
since equestrians would not want to bring horses to a country where
the disease is endemic.
   The last outbreak of African horse disease in Spain occurred in
August 1987 in central Spain.
   The most recent horse deaths occurred last week at the swank
Sotogrande resort in Cadiz province and in eight sites in
neighboring Malaga province, the Agriculture Ministry said.
   The Andalusia government said Thursday it canceled a special
show of Andalusian horses set for Seville during the Oct. 17-21
state visit of Queen Elizabeth II, the first state visit to Spain
by a British monarch.

<HEAD>Blast Shakes Buildings in Las Vegas, 80 Miles Away</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States detonated a major nuclear
device deep beneath the Nevada desert Thursday, sending a shudder
through high-rise hotels 80 miles from ground zero.
   ``It was a big one,'' said Energy Department spokeswoman Barbara
Yoerg, who was in a building at a control point 12 miles from
ground zero. ``The building was still swaying 20 seconds after
detonation.''
   The 5.8 reading on the Richter scale of ground motion at the
National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., was one of
the highest readings from a nuclear test in some time, according to
center spokesman Russ Needham.
   Thursday's 7 a.m. blast prompted calls to operators at some Las
Vegas resorts, with guests asking if there had been an earthquake.
   The test, code-named Dalhart, was the 11th conducted this year
at the Nevada Test Site and the 686th announced shot at the remote
desert site since testing began there in January of 1951. The last
previous test was Bullfrog on Aug. 30.
   The nuclear device was buried 2,100 feet beneath the surface of
Yucca Flat.
   The test was announced as having an explosive force of less than
150 kiltons, the upper limit set by U.S.-Soviet treaties. The blast
was thought to be near the upper limit because of the Richter
reading and because managers of high-rise buildings in Las Vegas
were warned two days before the blast not to have workers in
precarious positions at the time of detonation.
   Such warnings are issued only when the blast is expected to
reach near the upper limit.
   The Energy Department used to announce all tests as having a
force of less than 20 kilotons, or as having 20 to 150 kilotons.
That policy was dropped earlier this year and all tests are now
simply listed as less than 150 kilotons.
   The atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945 had an
explosive force of 13 kilotons.
   Ms. Yoerg, who has been at the site for many of the blasts, said
Thursday's shot was one of the strongest she has felt.
   ``It was like when you were a kid, being up in a tree on a
narrow branch, and having a strong gust of wind sway the tree,''
she said. ``You were swaying side to side.''

   The lead attorney has withdrawn from the
case of a couple who claim in a $100 million lawsuit that their
healthy baby was deliberately switched for a sickly one at a
Florida hospital 10 years ago.
   Marvin Ellin, a Baltimore lawyer, pulled out of the high-profile
case Wednesday, just as the FBI in Tampa closed a monthlong
investigation, saying it found no evidence that federal kidnapping
laws were violated.
   Ellin and attorney LaVonna Vice didn't explain their decision to
withdraw, but said it was unrelated to the strength of the case.
Ellin said only the couple, Ernest and Regina Twigg of Langhorne,
Pa., were authorized to say why he was breaking from their case.
   Representation of the Twiggs, who are battling in two Florida
courts, was turned over to William Post, a Seminole, Fla., attorney
hired by Ellin.
   Post said the case would continue uninterrupted.
   The Twiggs believe their biological daughter was swapped for
another baby shortly after birth in Hardee Memorial Hospital in
1978 and that records were altered to hide the switch. Arlena, the
child they raised, died in August after heart surgery.
   The Twiggs say they want their real daughter back and believe
she is a 9{-year-old Sarasota girl. They have asked a state judge
in Sarasota to order the girl to undergo a genetic test to
determine her parents. There has been no ruling.
   Arthur Ginsburg, a lawyer representing the Sarasota girl's
father, said he would investigate the Twiggs' fitness as parents
before allowing the girl to undergo tests.

<TEXT>
   An international banker arrested by the U.S.
Customs Service last week had told Congress earlier that he managed
a $20 million secret bank account for Panamanaian ruler Manuel
Antonio Noriega, according to Senate testimony made available
Thursday.
   The witness, Amjad Awan, an officer of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International (BCCI), said the account was used to make
cash payments to Panamanian politicians and to pay travel and creit
card expenses for Noriega and his family.
   Awan said he flew to Panama monthly to report to Noriega on the
status of his account.
   ``I made an effort to cultivate him,'' Awan told investigators
on Sept. 30 at a private session of the Senate Foreign Relations
subcommittee on terrorism and narcotics.
   Senators attending the session were told Awan's testimony would
be closely held because of ``our concern for Mr. Awan's life,''
subcomittee counsel Jack Blum said in the testimony released by the
office of Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
   A spokesman for Kerry, the subcommittee chairman, said that
following Awan's arrest the panel voted unanimously to release the
testimony and send a copy of it to the Justice Department.
   Awan was indicted this week on charges of money laundering. His
bank, which is based in Luxembourg, was charged in an indictment
handed down in Tampa, Fla., with laundering $14 million in
narcotics profits for members of Colombia's Medellin drug cartel.
   In his Senate testimony, Awan, 41, a native of Pakistan who
holds British citizenship, denied any knowlege of money laundering
and said his bank made an effort to avoid any contact with illicit
cash. He also said he had no knowlege of whether or not Noriega
received drug payments.
   But he said he made an effort to solicit accounts from Noriega
and in 1982 received from him a deposit of ``several hundred
thousand dollars'' in cash.
   ``He was head of (Panamanian) intelligence at the time and told
me that this was a secret account, a secret service account,'' Awan
said. ``I was told that the account should be kept in a highly
confidential and secret manner.''
   Awan said the balances in Noriega's account went up and down but
at one point reached a high of ``$20 million, maybe $25 million.''
   He said he paid cash out of the account only after receiving a
note signed by Noriega, preceded by a telephone call ``telling me
to expect the person to come in to get these funds.''
   To whom was the money paid? Awan was asked.
   ``Politicians,'' he replied. ``This was during the time of the
elections in Panama.''
   He said the expenses for Noriega's trips abroad also were paid
out of the account, as were personal expenses charged to credit
cards held by Noriega, his wife and their three daughters.
   Awan said that when he reported to Noriega on his account, the
Panamanian was not interested in his balance but wanted to know how
money had been spent.
   ``When I told him that this month we debited $50,000 to your
account, he wanted to know what that $50,000 consisted of. So it
was basically the airline bills, hotel bills, VISA card debits ...
limousines, reservations, theater tickets, schools, hospitals.''
   The St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times on Thursday quoted an
unidentified Justice Department official who worked on both the
Noriega and banker cases as saying: ``We have never been able to
identify a Noriega bank account outside of Panama. We would like to
hope this account would be a breakthrough.''
   He said U.S. investigators hope to obtain detailed records of
the account by the end of the week after the necessary paperwork is
completed.
   Records and sworn testimony presented earlier this year to
Senate investigators have shown that ``there's no doubt that BCCI
definitely handled Noriega money,'' the official told the Times.
   Both Noriega's and BCCI's alleged involvement in laundering drug
proceeds were also described in other Senate subcommittee testimony
by Leigh Ritch and Steven Kalish, two convicted Tampa-based
smugglers who are alleged to have laundered at least $4 million
through Panamanian banks.
   A week after his Senate testimony, Awan and four of other BCCI
officials were arrested in Tampa in a Customs Service sting
operation. They had been drawn to Tampa in response to a faked
wedding invitation sent by an undercover customs agent who had
known them in the two years he posed as a money launderer.

<HEAD>U.S. Official: Iran Uninterested In Dealing With Unauthorized
Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran has told the United States it is not
interested in dealing with unauthorized individuals over the
release of American hostages, a top diplomat said Thursday.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy said the Iranian
message had been part of communications between the two countries
conducted through Switzerland and other countries that have
diplomatic ties to Iran.
   The United States has not authorized any individuals to strike
deals with Iran over the release of the hostages, held by
pro-Iranian militants in Lebanon, he said.
   ``We have made sure through those same channels I referred to
that the government of Iran has received that same message, and
they realize our position and they affirm they are not interested
in dealing with private citizens and unauthorized individuals,''
Murphy said in testimony before the House subcommittee on Europe
and the Middle East.
   Murphy did not say when that communication took place.
   Former Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr said earlier this
month that an emissary for Vice President George Bush had
negotiated the release from Lebanon of Mithileshwar Singh, a U.S.
resident from India. Secretary of State George Shultz last week
denied that and other reports about negotiations with Iran.
   Murphy said the United States has repeatedly made clear to Iran
that the continued detention of Americans in Lebanon would preclude
any improvement in relations between the two countries.
   ``There will be no deals made for their release,'' he said.
``They must be returned forthwith.''
   Asked about reports that the hostages may be held by Palestinian
groups, Murphy said the United States did not have any evidence
that the Americans are in the hands of anyone but Lebanese faithful
of the Hezbollah, or Party of God. Hezbollah is closely allied with
Iran.
   In addition to the return of the nine American hostages, Murphy
said, the United States is seeking an end to terrorist activity
sponsored by Iran against targets abroad and an end to its
``intimidation'' of U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf region.
   Murphy said Iran already has adopted ``a softer tone towards
regimes in the region'' as part of its attempt to lift its
international isolation. Iran had launched both physical and verbal
attacks against Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other pro-Western Arab
governments for their support of Iraq and what it called their lax
adherence to strict Shiite Moslem principles.
   ``They're not abandoning the revolution, but they're obviously
less aggressive about exporting it. And we welcome that,'' Murphy
said.
   Iran has already complied with one U.S. condition for
improvement in relations by adopting a de facto cease-fire that
ended its seven-year war with Iraq, Murphy said.
   He said the recent changes in Iran's position are ``not a
180-degree turn, but we hope they're moving toward improved
relations.''
   The United States is willing at any time to launch a direct
dialogue, he added, but Iran is not yet ready.

   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski on
Thursday gave the opposition a second chance to join his government
and proposed a communist-dominated Cabinet to parliament for
approval.
   Rakowski told the Sejm, Poland's parliament, that he had
reserved four spots for the ``constructive opposition,'' including
a post as deputy premier and the Labor Ministry.
   ``The citizens to whom I proposed these posts refused to accept
them,'' Rakowski said in his first major policy address.
   ``One can look at these refusals according to the saying, `It's
never too late.' Due to all this, I leave all those posts vacant.
The doors remain open,'' he said.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said acceptance of government
posts by the opposition depended on whether the government could
bring about change and accept the banned union.
   ``I'm not interested in the government and in power. I'm
interested in structural changes and Soldarity ... If there is
pluralism and Solidarity, those people who refused to accept
government posts will have an open road,'' Walesa said.
   Rakowski bumped several senior members reponsible for the
government's failing economic reform program and proposed a new
generation of younger, little-known party officials to oversee
economic affairs.
   Deputy Prime Minister Czeslaw Sadowski, the government's
economic planning chief, and Deputy Prime Minister Zbignew
Szalajda, who had charge of the industry sector, lost their
portfolios.
   Economist Andrzej Wroblewski, 38, was nominated to head the
important finance ministry. Dominik Jastrzebski, 46, was proposed
as Minister of Foreign Economic Cooperation, essential as Poland
tries to increase its exports.
   Rakowski proposed nine new ministers, five from the governing
Polish United Workers' (Communist) Party, one from the Peasants'
Party, and two from the Democratic Party. Both parties are allies
of the communists.
   Isabella Planeta Malecka, the proposed health minister, was the
only woman and only non-party member nominated.
   Rakowski, however, retained three senior communist officials in
key positions _ Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, Foreign
Minister Tadeusz Olechowski and Defense Minister Florian Siwicki.
   Parliament will convene Friday to vote on the proposed
candidates.
   Rakowski acknowledged that Poland found itself in a difficult
situation, but held out hope that planned talks between the
government and the opposition could lead to change.
   ``We approach it with the best of will. We are aiming for
reasonable compromise which would ensure the maximum of possible
change,'' Rakowski said.
   Authorities promised the talks following strikes in August,
Poland's worst labor unrest in seven years.
   The talks, scheduled to begin next week, will discuss the
political and economic crisis and consider the future of
Solidarity, which was the Soviet bloc's only recognized trade union
until it was suppressed in 1981.
   When he was named the new prime minister, Rakowski said he hoped
to form a government of people with ``reformist attitudes'' that he
hoped would broaden the communist-dominated government and gain
society's support.
   Parliament approved Rakowski, former party propaganda chief and
Solidarity foe, on Sept. 27.
   Rakowski replaced Zbigniew Messner, whose entire Cabinet
resigned Sept. 19 after fierce criticism for mishandling the
economic reform program.

<HEAD>Shroud a Subject of Debate For Centuries</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Shroud, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Shroud of Turin has been the focus of scientific and
religious debate for centuries, the mysterious object of Christian
veneration and even the subject of a short-lived Broadway musical
comedy.
   What it wasn't, Roman Catholic Church officials conceded
Thursday, was the burial cloth of Jesus Christ.
   The history of the Shroud of Turin goes back only about 800
years, when a crusading knight said he saw it in Constantinople. It
never has been traced to the Holy Land.
   The Catholic Church never claimed it was Jesus' burial cloth,
and many critics have dismissed the linen cloth and its image as a
clever forgery.
   An early debunker was Pierre d'Arcis, bishop of Troyes. In a
1389 letter, he told Clement VII, the papal claimant in Avignon,
that the bishop who preceeded him in Troyes knew who painted it.
   The shroud, bequeathed to the pope by ex-King Umberto II of
Italy upon his death in 1983, has been kept in the cathedral at
Turin since 1578.
   Through records, the shroud can be traced to Lirey in France in
1354. In 1453, the royal family of Savoy got the shroud and kept it
at the castle of Chambery, where fire damaged it in 1532.
   There are references to a burial cloth of Christ as early as the
5th or 6th centuries, and coincidences have been found between the
shroud and 7th-century Byzantine art and liturgy.
   Witnesses including William of Tyre in 1171 and Robert of Clari
of the fourth crusade in 1203 reported seeing the shroud in the
imperial palace at Constantinople. The trail then is lost until the
shroud appears in France.
   The official church position has been that the shroud was a
``cherished object'' that must be given the respect due a relic.
   Wrapped in red silk under protective glass and an iron grill,
the shroud is kept on an altar in a silver chest that has only
rarely been opened in the last century.
   In an indication of the reverence accorded to the cloth, an
estimated 3 million people came to view it in 1978 when it was
exhibited in Turin on the 400th anniversary of its arrival. It was
the first time the shroud had been exhibited in 45 years.
   Perhaps the most significant occasion was in 1898, when a man
named Secundo Pia was allowed to photograph it.
   The result was sensational.
   The image on the shroud is similar to a photographic negative,
so the negative on Pia's photographic plate gave the world its
first positive image of the man on the shroud.
   Pia's work confounded skeptics: Why would a medieval forger
paint a negative image _ an image that produced a perfect positive
visible only centuries later when photography was invented?
   The mystery lived on, compounded by the Vatican's refusal for
years to allow the shroud to be tested. In 1986, Pope John Paul II
finally gave the go-ahead for testing but only on snippets of the
cloth, not on the image.
   Scientists continued to produce theories concerning the shroud.
In January 1982, Alan Whanger, a Duke University professor,
compared images of Christ on a 6th century Byzantine icon and a 7th
century coin with those on the shroud and said there were
astonishing similarities.
   Whanger theorized that the icon and the coin were copied from
the facial imprint on the shroud more than 800 years before the
cloth turned up in France in the 14th century.
   In March 1982, an Italian physician used the shroud to theorize
that Christ died of a heart attack on the cross and not of
suffocation as previously believed.
   Dr. Luigi Malantrucco said a large spot on the shroud was caused
by blood and serum from profuse bleeding after Christ was stabbed
by a soldier, as accounted in the Gospel according to St. John. If
Christ had earlier died of suffocation, then his blood would have
coagulated, Malantrucco said.
   The shroud even was the subject of a 1986 Broadway musical
titled ``Into the Light,'' focusing on the relationship between a
young boy and his father, a research scientist investigating the
cloth. Starring Dean Jones, the show opened to mostly negative
notices and closed after six performances and 14 previews

   A juror who says she was fired because
she was chosen for the 7{-month-long trial that led to the
conviction of Colombian drug lord Carlos Lehder Rivas is suing her
former employer.
   Neither the name of the juror or the employer was revealed in
the lawsuit. A federal court order required that the identity of
jurors in the high-security federal trial remain secret.
   The title of the case is ``Juror 157 vs. Corporate Defendant,
Ms. Defendant and Mr. Defendant,'' described as the president and
chairman of the company being sued.
   The lawsuit was filed Wednesday under federal statutes designed
to prevent people from being fired because of jury duty. The juror
is seeking reinstatement with full seniority, back pay plus
interest, civil fines of $1,000 for each violation of the law,
attorneys' fees and court costs.
   During the jury-selection process, the juror said she was a
mother of four who worked for an insurance company and had never
served on a jury.
   The juror said in the suit the president of the company told her
that her jury service would not create a problem. But after the
jury was selected, the lawsuit alleged, she was asked what she
``could do to get out of this.''
   After the first week of the trial, the juror was told that she
was being placed on a leave of absence without pay, but could
return to work when the trial ended, she said.
   In February, the juror received a letter saying her group health
insurance benefits were being terminated, the lawsuit said. On May
23, she called her employer and said she was ready to return to
work, but according to her lawsuit she was told she had been
replaced and had no job.
   Jury selection for Lehder's trial began in October; the jury was
seated in November. The trial lasted until May, when Lehder was
convicted of conspiracy, importation and possession of cocaine and
operating a continuing criminal enterprise.
   On July 20, Lehder, 39, who was identified as being one of the
founders of the violent Medellin cartel, was sentenced to life in
prison without parole plus 135 years and was fined $325,000.

   Authorities banned street rallies
Thursday in the southern republic of Montenegro and the police
chief of that area resigned after police used clubs and tear gas to
break up anti-government protests.
   In Belgrade, Communist Party leaders debated the legacy of late
leader Josip Tito, who has been blamed for forming a decentralized
government unable to deal with the country's worst economic crisis
in four decades.
   The weekend protests in Montenegro were the latest in almost
daily rallies driven by hundreds of thousands of Serbs pressing for
more control over Serbia's autonomous province of Kosovo. The
province's Slav minority, which is mainly Christian, allege
harassment by the mainly Moslem ethnic Albanian majority.
   Communists in several regions of Yugoslavia have stepped up
security alerts for the police, army and civilian defense units
following last weekend's events, said sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The ban and the resignation of Montenegro's interior minister,
Lazar Djodjic, were apparently moves to defuse three months of
protests. Demonstrators also are protesting 217 percent inflation,
15 percent unemployment and wages of less than $100 a month.
   The rallies, backed by Serbian Communist Party chief Slobodan
Milosevic, have angered communist leaders in other republics.
Supporters of the ambitious Serbian leader have referred to him as
``the second Tito.''
   At the Belgrade meeting of the ruling party Politburo, Milosevic
and federal party chief Stipe Suvar angrily clashed over a June
statement by 19 intellectuals which blamed Tito's policies for the
country's present troubles.
   Suvar said the document was an ``assault on Tito by Serbian
nationalists'' and said Serbia's communists had failed to criticize
the document, according to the state-run news agency Tanjug.
   Milosevic said Suvar's comments were ``uncalled for'' since the
Serbian party was the first to denounce the intellectuals'
statement.
   Dusan Ckrebic, a prominent member of Serbia's leadership, said
Suvar's remarks were unacceptable because they represent serious
accusations against Serbia's leaders.
   The latest dispute forms the backdrop to a meeting Monday of the
Communist Party's policy-setting Central Committee where several
changes are expected in the leadership.
   Three senior Communists _ Yugoslavia's vice president, the head
of its official trade unions and a deputy premier _ were named
Thursday as leaders likely to lose their seats on the 165-member
Central Committee.
   The three were listed by a senior Communist member of the
Central Committee at a meeting in the northern republic of
Slovenia, according to Belgrade newspapers Thursday. The official
was not identified.
   The three include Stane Dolanc, who was seen as No. 2 to Tito in
the last years of Tito's undisputed 35-year rule. Tito died in 1980.
   Serbian nationalists criticize Dolanc, 62, as not tough enough
toward ethnic Albanian nationalists during 1981 racial riots in
Kosovo. Dolanc was interior minister at the time.
   Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics, is now
pushing for more control over Kosovo and Vojvodina provinces.
   The other two men named as likely to lose their seats were
Marjan Orozen, head of the national trade union organization, and
Janez Zemljaric, a deputy premier.
   In Montenegro, where nationalist unrest turned into
anti-government protests by workers and students last weekend, the
republic's Communist Party Politburo announced ``urgent measures''
to stop demonstrations scheduled for this weekend.
   The authorities did not specify what ``urgent measures'' meant.
   Protesters have demanded the resignation of the republic's
leadership.

<HEAD>East Germany To Announce Payments To Holocaust Victims, Bronfman
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany is likely to announce
next week it will pay reparations to survivors of the Nazi
Holocaust, the head of the World Jewish Congress said Thursday.
   Edgar M. Bronfman, president of the New York-based Jewish
organization, said he would meet with East German leader Erich
Honecker on Monday in East Berlin to discuss the payments.
   ``In principle, what I'm going to be doing there is hopefully
getting the East German government to agree that East Germany too
has some responsibility for what took place in Germany during the
Second World War, particularly the Holocaust,'' Bro Asked by The Associated
Press if he expected the East Germans
would tell him during his visit that they have decided to make the
reparations payments, Bronfman said: ``Yes, I believe so.''nfman said.
  
   A final decision on the payments to victims of Nazi Germany
would mark a major change in the communist country's policies.
   Since the end of World War II, East Germany has argued it bore
no responsibility for Nazi atrocities because the nation was not
founded until 1949.
   West Germany signed an agreement in 1952 with the World Jewish
Congress to compensate Holocaust victims, and since then has paid
out more than $48 billion to survivors and their families. We East
Germany had been considering paying a up to $100 million to
Holocaust survivors and victims' families.
   ``For them now to take the proper moral position and say `Yes,
we will pay some reparations,' even if it is a token amount, will
be good news for the entire world,'' Bronfman said.
   He said East German reparations to survivors of Nazi atrocities
would be an important step in reminding the world what happened
during the Holocaust.
   ``Our position is it's not a question of just money, but that
the Holocaust has to be taught not just to Germans, but to
everyone,'' Bronfman said.
   Bronfman said he has resisted East German attempts to link
reparations to trade agreements with the United States.
   ``I know they are looking for trade agreements with the United
States, and I have said you cannot tie any payments you're going to
make to the victims of the Holocaust to any boons you might get
from the U.S. government,'' Bronfman said.
   Bronfman was in Bonn for a conference of the East-West Forum,
which he heads. The New York-based group consists of Western
intellectuals and politicians who meet to discuss developments in
East-West relations.

   Two paintings by Dutch masters Frans
Hals and Jacob van Ruisdael were stolen at gunpoint from a small
museum early Thursday, police said.
   An armed man seized the caretaker and his wife at about 1:30
a.m. and forced them to let him into Mrs. van Aerden's Hostel
Museum in this central Dutch town, according to police spokeswoman
Ingrid Verbeek.
   She said the thief fled with two paintings _ a canvas by Hals
titled ``The Laughing Boys With The Beer Mug,'' worth at least
$438,000, and a Ruisdael painting, ``Forest Landscape With
Flowering Elder,'' for which no value was given.
   The couple, who lived on the premises, was released unharmed,
she said.
   The Hostel Museum, a privately owned museum built in 1670, is
part of a historic complex that houses nine elderly women and is
named after its founder, Maria van Aerden, Ms. Verbeek said.
   Its collection includes about 25 other paintings and a room with
period furniture, Ms. Verbeek said.
   Frans Hals, thought to have been born between 1580 and 1585, is
regarded as one of the most prominent Dutch landscape and portrait
painters.
   Jacob van Ruisdael, born in 1628, came from a family of painters
and art dealers from the city of Haarlem near Amsterdam.
   The disappearance of the two works comes after the theft in May
of three paintings by Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cezanne and Johan
Jongkind, from Amsterdam's Municipal Museum. Burglars smashed a
ground-floor window to get to the paintings, which were recovered
10 days later by an undercover police agent offering to buy them
for $1.1 million.
   That incident sparked a nationwide debate on the lax security in
the nation's museums. A recent government report severely
criticized security measures at museums that house the nation's
most valuable art works.

<TEXT>
   With a champagne toast, the United States and
the Soviet Union signed a five-year agreement Thursday which calls
for cooperative research programs to combat AIDS, drug abuse,
alcoholism and polio.
   Valentin Pokrovsky, president of the Soviet Academy of Medical
Science and head of a five-member Soviet delegation, expressed hope
that the agreement will mark the ``beginning of a wonderful long
road which we will travel together.''
   Signing for the United States at a brief ceremony at the
National Academy of Sciences was Samuel O. Thier, president of the
U.S. Institute of Medicine. He said the talks leading up to the
agreement were cordial and he predicted an ``extremely pleasant''
experience for both sides if the current atmosphere is maintained.
   The initial plans call for several joint activities in 1989,
including a symposium in the United States on AIDS research and a
meeting in the Soviet Union on the health effects of radiation.
   At a news conference Wednesday night, Pokrovsky said the last
summit meeting between President Reagan and Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev and the ``general political atmosphere'' have
contributed to closer cooperation. He wore a lapel pin displaying
the Soviet and American flags.
   Pokrovsky said U.S. experts are eager to draw on Soviet
expertise in the health effects of radiation, based on the
aftermath of the April 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant.
   At the same time, he said, the program will offer Soviet experts
an opportunity to learn how Americans deal with AIDS, a disease
which has a far higher incidence in the United States than in the
Soviet Union.
   He said there has been only one Soviet fatality since March 1987
as a result of AIDS, but 81 persons who are not yet sick have been
diagnosed as carrying AIDS antibodies. He acknowledged that the
percentage of Soviet citizens who have been tested for AIDS is
relatively small _ 11 million.
   There have been about 300 cases of non-Soviet citizens in the
Soviet Union afflicted with AIDS, primarily students from African
countries where the disease is common.
   The two sides agreed that in the areas of alcoholism and drug
abuse, the focus will be on transmission to offspring,
identification of populations at risk and ways to prevent and treat
these problems.
   As for polio, the research will emphasize the application of
molecular biology to the monitoring and application of the disease.
   The two countries have existing cooperative programs in the
health area and the new agreement is designed to complement them.
   Prior to the signing ceremony, the Soviet delegates visited
research centers in Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; New York;
Hartford, Conn.; Boston; Atlanta; Kansas City, Mo.; St. Louis; and
Oak Ridge, Tenn.

<HEAD>Police Have Suspect in Campus Rapes, but Demonstrators Blame
Sexism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   University of Illinois students, shaken by a
series of rapes, are taking steps to protect themselves and to
fight the sexism many blame for the attacks, student leaders and
school officials say.
   The attacks around the campus stopped when police identified a
suspect, but students are labeling sexism a factor _ a message
underscored with a candlight march and rally Wednesday night.
   ``The message at the rally was that sexism is in our society and
it is the cause of a lot of things that go wrong _ rape,
discrimination and women feeling low self-esteem,'' Jane Brouwer,
president of the Panhellenic Council, said Thursday. The council
represents about 3,500 sorority members on the 35,000-student
campus and helped organize the demonstration.
   ``A lot of people just don't think about sexism,'' Ms. Brouwer
said.
   About 500 students demonstrated Wednesday, carrying candles to
draw attention to the role of sexism in the series of assaults that
police attribute to a serial rapist.
   ``We have a suspect,'' Champaign Detective Gerald Schweighart
said Thursday. ``He was identified just before the series of rapes
stopped _ around Sept. 10.''
   Police are awaiting results of tests on the suspect's blood and
have made no arrest, Schweighart said.
   Investigators believe about nine rapes have been committed by
the same man since spring, said Schweighart.
   The rally Wednesday united groups as diverse as the Panhellenic
Council, the campus chapter of the NAACP and a political coalition,
United Progressives.
   The aim was to stress the role of sexism in society, from pin-up
calendars and pornography to references to women in casual
conversation, participants said.
   ``We need a general respect of men and women for each other,''
Ms. Brouwer said. ``If we are serious, we can make a change.'
   Jenny Keller, a senior at the school majoring in political
science who identified herself as a victim of rape, was one of the
speakers at the rally.
   ``We're not asking for pity ... we're demanding respect ... for
the strength it takes to go through this experience,'' said Ms.
Keller. ``The vast majority of women are raped by friends,
relatives, people who live in their dormitories.''
   Petitions were circulated urging pay equity at the university,
more education on the problems of sexism, and more emphasis on
ensuring campus safety.
   Participants also condemned campus traditions such as panty
raids.
   Jeff Jochims, president of the Interfraternity Council,
acknowledged the fraternity system has not done a lot to fight
sexism.
   ``We need to realize the Greek system has always had a problem
with sexism,'' Jochims said at the rally. ``It's ugly, but it's a
reality.''
   He said members are working ``to change the image of
fraternities.''
   Mary Ellen O'Shaughnessey, assistant dean of students, said
Thursday the demonstrators' concerns are justified.
   Sexism is not just a campus problem, she said, ``it is a
cultural issue.''
   Ms. O'Shaughnessey said her office has organized seminars on
personal safety, and supervised programs providing women with
whistles to use in sounding the alarm if they feel threatened and
van service to avert the need for women to walk home alone from
class or work at night. Emergency telephones also have been placed
around campus.
   Though not new, O'Shaughnessey said the programs seem to be
attracting more interest now. She estimated the effort costs about
$33,000 a year.
   About 7,000 whistles have been distributed this year, about
1,000 women received van rides in a two-week period this fall and
about 150 people have participated in the safety seminars, she said.
   In addition, Jochims said fraternity members escort women on
campus so they do not have to walk alone, and are preparing a
program to patrol areas where attacks have occurred.

<DATELINE>LINDAU, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Felix Wankel, inventor of the rotary
engine, has died at age 86.
   Wankel died on Sunday, said Thomas Burkhardt, a close friend of
the German inventor.
   Wankel began work on a rotary engine in 1926 and began producing
the new motor at the West German NSU Motor Works in 1957.
   Through the years, Wankel also designed motors for the Japanese
auto companies Mazda and Toyota, as well as engine superchargers.
   The West German NSU Spider was the first car to be mass-produced
with the Wankel rotary engine, that was in 1964. The now-defunct
NSU company also produced the RO 80 Wankel rotary engine car, which
had a reputation for unreliability and was discontinued in 1977.
   There was much interest in Wankel's rotary engine in the 1960s
and early 1970s. According to West German automobile industry
figures, in 1971 Wankel was working with 24 different companies
around the world on plans to further develop his engine.
   But the first oil crisis of 1973-74 changed all that, bringing a
drastic loss of interest in investing in the automobile industry,
experts say.
   Mazda continued work on developing the Wankel rotary engine and
made the concept a successful one.
   According to industry figures, Mazda has produced more than 1.5
million cars with rotary engines including the popular RX-7 sports
car.
   In 1976 Wankel also developed a streamlined amphibious car he
called ``Zisch,'' German for ``whoosh,'' which was able to reach 62
mph with its 300 horsepower engine.
   Wankel's research offices are in Lindau, on the shores of Lake
Constance in southern West Germany.
   Wankel's wife died in 1978. They had no children.

   Police and army troops patrolled the
streets of two southern cities Thursday after the government
enacted tough new gun laws to combat ethnic violence that left
hundreds dead this month.
   Officials in Karachi, the country's largest city, and Hyderabad,
100 miles to the northeast, reported their districts were returning
to normal following five days of bloody clashes earlier this month
that left about 275 people dead.
   The violence involved ethnic Indians, who comprise more than 40
percent of the southern province of Sind and seek recognition as a
separate nationality, and militant Sindhis seeking independence for
the province.
   In Islamabad, the government Wednesday announced new laws that
provide prison sentences of up to 14 years for possession of
machine guns, other heavy weapons and their ammunition.
   On the night of Sept. 30, Sindhi militants sprayed the streets
of Hyderabad with gunfire, massacring nearly 200 people, mostly
ethnic Indians, authorities said.
   The violence touched off several days of retaliatory rioting in
Karachi, killing 60 more people, mostly Indians.
   Police said many of the deaths were caused by heavy weapons that
have surfaced in Pakistan during the 10-year war in neighboring
Afghanistan.
   The new laws announced by the government provide for special
courts and speedy trials for accused criminals, and authorize
provincial governments to use military force for public security.
   ``It does not mean that martial law been imposed in Sind
province,'' Justice Minister Wasim Sajjad told reporters in
Islamabad.
   ``The measures can be extended to other parts of Pakistan, if
similar incidents take place there,'' he said.

<HEAD>West Germans Say Iran Ready To Improve Relations With West</HEAD>

   High-ranking West German officials say
Iran has indicated a readiness to slowly move toward improving
relations with the United States and other Western nations.
   ``The signals are definately improving,'' said a West German
official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition he not be
identified.
   ``There are influential people in the Tehran government who
understand that isolation is no longer politically or economically
viable. They know it is in the country's best interests to return
to a broader world community,'' the official said.
   He described the Iranian officials as ``pragmatists who clearly
see the value of rapproachment.''
   West Germany has long enjoyed good relations with Iran and with
Iraq, Tehran's bitter foe in the Persian Gulf war. The two
countries are observing a cease-fire.
   In recent months, Bonn officials have said they wanted to use
those good relations in efforts to improve conditions in the Middle
East and to help broker more ties between Iran and the United
States.
   Unlike the United States and other countries which broke off or
curtailed ties with Iran after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini came to
power in 1979, West Germany has kept its relations active and has
sought to expand ties during the past year.
   West German officials in Bonn said those efforts paid off in
winning the release in September of West German hostage Rudolf
Cordes, held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers in Lebanon.
   After Cordes' release, ``intensive talks continued with Iran on
the question of freedom for other hostages in Lebanon,'' the Bonn
source said.
   He added that those West German initiatives ``may have also
played a role'' in the release on Oct. 3 of Mithileshwar Sing, an
Indian professor who holds permanent U.S. residency status.
   Government sources in Bonn said Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher was informed by Tehran at least a day in advance of the
release of hostage Singh and immediately told Secretary of State
George Shultz.
   ``The fact that we were informed of this latest release in
advance is also a sign of Tehran's appreciation of West Germany's
efforts in the region,'' one source told the AP.
   Genscher is scheduled to visit Tehran in November, and Bonn
sources said he would use the opportunity to deepen dialogue with
Iran on its relations with the West and to press for more help in
winning the release of the remaining foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   ``We hope that all sides will use this opportunity to improve
relations,'' he said.

   The five astronauts who flew the space shuttle
Discovery mission earlier this month were welcomed as heroes in
Congress on Thursday and congratulated for the ``great feeling you
have given all Americans.''
   In response, flight commander Frederick H. Hauck said the
successful four-day mission was ``tremendous testimony to a very
large team throughout the country.''
   Hauck and his crew _ pilot Richard O. Covey and mission
specialists John M. Lounge, David C. Hilmers and George D. Nelson _
first made an appearance in the House gallery to the applause of
members on the floor, and then before space committees of the House
and Senate.
   ``You made us very proud of you,'' said Rep. Manuel Lujan,
R-N.M., who is retiring from Congress after years of service on the
House Science and Technology Committee of which he was ranking
minority member.
   ``It wasn't just a routine flight this time,'' Lujan said. ``We
all breathed a great sigh of relief when you finally got into
orbit. We thank you for the great feeling you have given all
Americans.''
   The House passed a resolution Wednesday congratulating the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the flight crew, and
NASA's workers and contractors ``who contributed to the successful
return of the space shuttle Discovery to safe operations in outer
space.''
   The House committee presented each crew member with a framed
copy of the resolution. The astronauts showed a brief film of their
flight.
   The Discovery flight, which began on Sept. 29, was the first
shuttle mission since the shuttle Challenger blew up on liftoff
with a loss of seven lives on Jan. 28, 1986. Extensive revisions
were made in the shuttle program before the Discovery flight.
   Richard Truly, the head of NASA's shuttle program, spoke of
``this magnificent and extremely successful mission,'' and said
``We in NASA ... have accomplished what we said we would
accomplish.''
   The successful outcome, he said, ``showed this was not a first
flight; this was a mature system that flew again after a long
down-time.''
   And, he added, ``the best part is that we have to do it again.''

   Delegates at the Conservative Party's
conference Thursday jeered Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
ousted predecessor Edward Heath when he attacked her opposition to
closer union among European Economic Community nations.
   Others applauded Heath when he hailed the scheduled dismantling
in 1992 of all trade barriers within the EEC as a ``major movement
toward the unity of Europe in every way.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, to whom the 4,500 delegates sang ``Happy
Birthday'' _ she turned 63 _ left the conference center to return
to her hotel before the intervention by Heath. They have been on
bad terms since she ousted him as party leader in 1975 after he
lost two successive elections.
   Aides said she wanted to work on her keynote address to the
final session of the four-day convention Friday.
   Earlier, treasury chief Nigel Lawson, the chancellor of the
exchequer, promised more tax cuts ``when prudent'' and forecast a
drop next year in inflation, now 5.7 percent and rising.
   But in his address to the convention in this south England
resort he warned that interest rates, now at 12 percent, would
remain high for ``quite a while.''
   Heath, prime minister when Britain joined the EEC in 1973, said
the rest of the 12-nation trade bloc would not tolerate Britain
treating the post-1992 single market merely as a ``free trade
area.''
   ``It is a major movement toward the unity of Europe in every
way,'' said Heath. ``It also concerns a common currency with a
common monetary system and a common bank.''
   Several dozen delegates raised small replicas of the Union Jack
and waved notices declaring, ``No to Ted.''
   In a policy speech last month in Bruges, Belgium, Mrs. Thatcher
rejected a common European currency, bank or monetary system and
said a United States of Europe would never come about. She
criticized what she called the bureacracy at the EEC headquarters
in Brussels.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe defended Mrs. Thatcher's
rejection of what she regards as unrealistic talk of a united
Europe. He said she was as much a European as French President
Francois Mitterrand or West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, leaders
of the two other biggest financial contributors to the EEC.
   On East-West relations, Howe said the West should not assume
that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's desire for reform was
``shared throughout the Soviet command structure.''
   ``The Red Army and the KGB still loom in force,'' he said.
``That's why the West must go on negotiating (arms cuts) from
strength.''

<HEAD>Fitzwater Defends Reagan's Record on Press Conferences</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
suggested Thursday that the institution of the presidential press
conference is overrated as a means of communicating with the
American people.
   Defending the infrequency with which President Reagan has held
full-scale, primetime press conferences, Fitzwater said that no
chief executive should be expected to fulfill a quota on such
question-and-answer sessions.
   Fitzwater was responding during his daily news briefing to a
Harvard commission's report that said, among other things, that
White House news conferences have fallen into ``a serious state of
disarray'' under Reagan.
   The spokesman said the report Wednesday by the panel of
journalists and scholars did include several positive
recommendations on how to improve the conduct of these sessions.
The commission said, for instance, that press conferences should be
held mostly in the daytime.
   But it also criticized Reagan for holding too few press
conferences, saying his successor should ``take his lumps on a more
frequent basis.''
   ``The longer presidents go without a press conference, the
greater the suspicion that there is something to hide, and the
greater the pressure becomes for holding press conferences,'' the
16-member Harvard Commission on the Presidential News Conference
said.
   Reagan pledged to hold news conferences once a month, but has
held only 45 in more than 7{ years in office and once let 5{ months
pass without one. The last such session came at the end of the
seven-nation economic summit in Toronto last June.
   The report said that Reagan, ``although successful in the short
run in dodging difficult questions, suffers from the perception
that he is not really in charge of his own White House.''
   It recommended that presidents meet with the media twice a month
during daytime hours and limit televised evening news conferences
to six a year.
   Asked to respond to these and other criticisms, Fitzwater said,
``I don't think any president in good conscience would ever
commit'' to a specific number of formal press conferences.
   ``What I'm trying to say is that ... there is a diversity of
ways to communicate with the general public besides a press
conference,'' he added. ``We've held the press conferences that we
think are appropriate. We've held other kinds of press interviews
that we think are useful, and in the final analysis, you can be the
judge.''
   Asked what criteria are used to decide when the president holds
a news conference, Fitzwater said ``the guiding factor is what's in
the public interest and ways to communicate with the American
public.''
   The spokesman acknowledged that the White House intentionally
kept Reagan at a distance from the media during the height of the
Iran-Contra affair, but he said that was because officials didn't
want to say anything that might prejudice investigations into the
matter.
   ``We had no intention of holding press conferences and having
the president comment on ongoing investigations,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said Reagan will likely have another news conference before
the end of the year, but not before Election Day on Nov. 8.

   The House on Thursday refused to consider an
educational grant bill that Republicans attacked as pork-barrel
legislation because its price tag had grown from $750,000 to $60
million.
   The proposal, making its second trip to the House floor, didn't
even reach the debate stage because lawmakers voted 256-131 to
reject the rule that had to be approved before debate could begin.
   The opposition was led by Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., who pointed
out that the measure was far different and much costlier than the
version that had been approved by the House earlier in the session.
   The original bill merely authorized the Department of Education
to provide $750,000 to the Taft Institute, which uses public and
private money to provide summer programs for high school civics
studies teachers.
   By the time the Senate and House-Senate conferees had completed
their work, the package had swollen by nearly $60 million, with
grant authorizations targeted to some 16 schools and educational
programs.
   ``We're famous for having gargantuan side show freaks grow out
of nothing, but this one tops them all,'' said Rep. Jim Kolbe,
R-Ariz.

<HEAD>China Acts to Curb Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   China will freeze or impose ceilings on the
prices of a wide range of goods to curb rising inflation, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday.
   It was the first government indication that it will actually
roll back price reforms, rather than merely halting them as
previously announced.
   ``The situation in the last month shows that the prices of some
commodities have not yet been reined in,'' Xinhua quoted Cheng
Zhiping, director of the State Administration of Commodity Prices,
as saying.
   He said the government will establish national price ceilings
for important ``means of production'' and freeze the prices of
``daily necessities'' that previously were decontrolled. Xinhua did
not list the affected items.
   Price ceilings will be set for grain now sold on the free
market, and the prices of chemical fertilizer, pesticides and other
agricultural inputs will be regulated, Xinhua quoted Cheng as
saying.
   Cheng spoke two weeks after the ruling Communist Party ordered a
two-year effort to control inflation officially estimated at about
20 percent but believed to be higher. The party called for steps to
end hoarding, profiteering and loose credit that have fueled
inflation, and for a cutback in industrial growth that has strained
the country's weak infrastructure.
   Premier Li Peng on Tuesday ordered the State Council, China's
cabinet, to put the new austerity policy into effect.
   ``Nobody can shirk responsiblity and the problems cannot be left
unsettled,'' Xinhua quoted him as saying. He said soaring prices
``are affecting social security and people's confidence in
reform,'' and that a period of stability is needed.
   A series of Xinhua reports Thursday indicated the government
envisions a wide-scale retrenchment in its decade-old process of
reducing central controls over the economy.
   One report quoted Commerce Minister Hu Ping as saying the retail
price of major commodities will be standardized. Many commodities
deemed essential, such as soap, currently float within locally set
ranges, while hundreds of other light industrial items are
completely decontrolled.
   Hu also was quoted as saying the government will seek to
stablize the prices of non-staple foods, most of which now sell on
the free market at prices set by local supply and demand. Again
Xinhua gave no specific list of goods affected or the level at
which prices would be held.
   Xinhua also gave no date for enacting the measures announced by
Cheng and Hu.
   Economists generally believe that decontrol of prices so they
can reflect supply and demand is essential to China's effort to
replace cumbersome central planning with a more flexible
market-style economy. However, China's price reform has been
piecemeal, resulting in a hodge-podge of controlled,
semi-controlled and decontrolled prices.
   Some goods are sold both by the state at artifically low prices
and on the free market at much higher prices, resulting in growing
profiteering. Li and other top officials recently said this mix of
prices will remain for a long time.
   Liu Hongru, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, meanwhile reported a drop in the money supply since
late September and slowdown in new loan issues. Xinhua quoted Liu
as saying both developments indicated that government moves to
tighten loose credit were taking effect.

   The nation's merchandise trade deficit surged
to $12.18 billion in August as a record flood of imported products
swamped a continued boom in exports, the government reported
Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said the August imbalance was $2.7
billion higher than the July figure, which had been the lowest
monthly deficit in 3{ years.
   While the August figure was slightly worse than expected,
financial markets took the news in stride, unlike a year ago when a
disappointing trade report set off a chain of events culminating in
the Oct. 19 stock market collapse.
   The dollar tumbled briefly in hectic foreign exchange trading
but then steadied. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
gained 7.12 points to close at 2,133.36.
   The market reaction was in sharp contrast to a year ago, when
the August trade report sent the Dow plunging by 95 points, setting
the stage for the record 508-point drop five days later on Black
Monday.
   Analysts said the market got the bad news out of the way early
this time, falling by more than 30 points on Wednesday on fears
that the report would show a higher trade deficit.
   The Reagan administration, which has been fending off attacks on
its trade record by Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis and running mate Lloyd Bentsen, moved quickly to play down
the significance of the widening in the August deficit.
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity noted that the trade
deficit for the first eight months of the year is running at an
annual rate of $138.5 billion, a 19 percent improvement from the
record deficit of $170.3 billion run up in 1987.
   ``I have been saying for some time now that we can hope for an
improvement of about $30 billion in the trade deficit this year.
The figures for the first eight months show that we are right on
target,'' Verity said.
   However, Bentsen said the steep rise in the August deficit was
another example of failed Republican economic policies.
   ``While imports flood America, (GOP nominees) George Bush and
Dan Quayle sit back and let the damage accumulate, telling
Americans, `Don't worry. Be happy.'''
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said the August
deficit was new evidence that the nation's trade problems are far
from being solved.
   ``The long-awaited light at the end of the tunnel has turned out
to be an onrushing freight train loaded with imported goods,'' said
Byrd. ``This Congress passed a comprehensive trade bill. ... What
we need is an administration that will enforce it.''
   In August, both exports and imports climbed to record levels.
   Exports were up $1.03 billion to $27.55 billion as America sold
more cars, business capital goods and farm products to foreigners.
The boom in export sales has lifted the fortunes of American
manufacturing companies and is credited as the principal reason the
country is enjoying better-than-expected overall economic growth.
   But imports rose even faster than exports in August, surging by
$3.73 billion to an all-time high of $39.72 billion.
   Private economists viewed the big jump in imports with concern.
They said it is unrealistic to expect further big increases in
export levels, which are up 29 percent so far this year from a year
ago.
   They said that for the trade deficit to shrink from the current
level, imports, which are up 10 percent so far this year, will have
to begin to shrink.
   ``The process of trade adjustment is slowing down,'' said Bruce
Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch. ``We made stellar
gains in the first half of the year, but we are going to make very
little further progress for the rest of the year.''
   Steinberg predicted that the trade deficit for this year would
shrink by about $40 billion but that the decline in 1989 would be a
much more modest $10 billion.
   Other analysts noted that foreign shipments of various types of
consumer goods, such as clothing, shoes and electronics, began
rising in August as retailers, faced with depleted inventories,
began placing new orders.
   ``When you cut through all the month-to-month fluctuations, you
are still left with a very large trade deficit,'' said Lawrence
Chimerine, president of the WEFA Group, an economic forecasting
firm.
   Chimerine predicted that the dollar will have to fall further,
boosting prices of imported goods even more as a way of reducing
American demand.
   The import rise included a $1.1 billion increase in consumer
goods and a similar advance in business capital goods, reflecting
higher demand for computers and electrical machinery.
   Car imports rose by $700 million in August, while oil imports
were up by $300 million to $3.7 billion as a jump in volume offset
a drop in the price per barrel to $15.15.
   The $1.03 billion rise in U.S. exports was attributed mainly to
an increase of $800 million in sales of American cars and parts and
a $200 million rise in the sales of farm goods.
   As usual, the largest single deficit was incurred with Japan, an
imbalance of $4.8 billion, up from a July deficit of $4.4 billion.
The United States recorded deficits of $1.7 billion with Taiwan and
$1.4 billion with Western Europe.

<HEAD>Bush Edging Dukakis in Louisiana, Poll Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush holds a narrow
edge over Democrat Michael Dukakis among Louisiana voters, but Dan
Quayle is seen as a weak link on the GOP ticket, according to a
poll by Mason-Dixon Opinion Research.
   The Republican ticket is supported by 47 percent of those
polled, compared to 43 percent for the Democratic ticket of Dukakis
and Lloyd Bentsen.
   However, if voters were casting ballots for president only,
Bush's lead would increase to 51 percent to 40 percent for Dukakis.
   Fifty-six percent of those questioned believed that Quayle is
not qualified to serve as president, while 73 percent felt that
Bentsen would be qualified to serve.
   The poll, taken for Gannett News Service and several Louisiana
television stations, was based on telephone interviews of 821
registered voters from Oct. 7-9. It had a margin of potential error
of 4 percent.

<HEAD>House Postpones Vote on Credit Card Disclosure Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Thursday postponed until next
week a vote on legislation that would establish disclosure
requirements for banks, department stores and other firms that
offer credit cards.
   The Senate-passed measure requires that information to be
provided in direct-mail solicitations include annual fees, the
interest rate charged for unpaid balances, the method for
calculating that balance and the length of grace periods during
which no interest is charged. Similarly, late fees, over-the-limit
fees and fees for cash advances must be disclosed.
   Currently, only a handful of states have laws requiring public
disclosure of such information before consumers apply for the cards.
   Under an agreement the leadership gave to members, no vote was
to be taken in the House after 1 p.m. on Thursday. The bill got to
the floor shortly before 2 p.m. and was discussed by House members.
   A vote on the credit-card disclosure measure will be taken when
the House returns from its weekend recess on Tuesday.
   Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the House
Banking Committee and the bill's floor manager, called the measure
``one of the most important and strongest credit disclosure acts
that we have been able to move through the Congress since the first
truth-in-lending statute was passed 20 years ago.''
   He said the proposed law ``ends the hide-and-seek approach to
disclosures on credit card terms. It prevents sneak attacks on
unsuspecting consumers who often learn of charges and fees long
after the fact _ too late to reject the card and seek
alternatives.''
   St Germain said more than 100 million consumers have one or more
credit cards with outstanding balances approaching $150 billion. He
also said credit card companies solicit nearly 2.5 billion
consumers a year.
   Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., a chief House sponsor, said
millions of card users are not aware that there are tremendous
differences between the costs of the credit cards available. ``This
should put an end to the unjustifiable rates of 18, 19 or 20
percent some card issuers are now able to charge.''
   The measure has been endorsed by a wide range of consumer groups.
   But it has its opponents too.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the consumer
subcommittee, called the measure ``a bad bill disguised as a
consumer protection bill. It is fitting that we are taking up (the
bill) in the month of Halloween, because this bill indeed wears a
mask. And unlike Halloween, where you at least get the option of
trick or treat, this bill offers only trick or trick.''
   Among other things, Annunzio opposes the measure because it
would prohibit states from enacting stricter standards and puts no
limit on the amount of interest on outstanding balances that card
issuers may charge.
   ``Let me suggest that what Americans want in their credit cards
is not more disclosure, but lower interest rates on their
charges,'' he said. ``There is nothing in this legislation that
will cause credit interests to fall.''

<HEAD>Poll Finds Support For Government Spending On Birth Control
Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LORI DODGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of adults believe schools should
teach sex education and the federal government should put more
money into development of new birth control methods, according to a
poll released Thursday by Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
   The poll said 82 percent of the respondents favor government
spending on research and development of new and improved birth
control methods, while 16 percent of those polled do not.
   In addition, 59 percent of those interviewed said they thought
the European-developed birth control pill RU 486, which can
terminate a pregnancy in its first few weeks, should be made
available in this country. Thirty-three percent disagreed.
   Humphrey Taylor, president of Louis Harris, said the poll also
found that abortion is becoming a less controversial issue.
   In 1979, 38 percent said abortion was a decisive issue in
choosing a candidate for elective office. That number dropped in
1982 to 28 percent and in 1988 to 18 percent. Of the 18 percent, 9
percent said they could not vote for a pro-choice candidate and 9
percent said they could not vote for an anti-abortion candidate.
   ``So one clear finding is that a lot of the heat is going out of
the abortion issue and that political candidates in 1988 need not
worry as much as they have in the past about losing votes on it _
one way or the other,'' Taylor said.
   Results of the poll, conducted by Louis Harris and Associates,
were released at the start of Planned Parenthood's annual meeting
in St. Louis. The findings were based on telephone interviews
conducted in May with 1,250 randomly selected adults nationwide.
The poll's margin of error was 3 percent.
   Anne Saunier, Planned Parenthood's chairwoman, said that of the
6 million pregnancies in the United States each year, half are
unintended. Of the unintended pregnancies, half end in abortion,
she said.
   More than 1 million teen-agers become pregnant each year, and
more than 80 percent of those pregnancies are unintended, she said.
   ``Obviously, something is wrong,'' Saunier said. ``The federal
government spends approximately $9 million on contraceptive
research each year _ less than is spent every 15 minutes for
defense in this country.''
   Saunier said 95 percent of Americans think teen-age pregnancy is
a serious problem, up 11 percent since a 1985 Planned
Parenthood@Harris survey. Sixty-two percent think the problem is
getting worse.
   At the same time, support for sex education in schools has grown
4 percent since 1985. This year's study found that 89 percent of
those polled think sex education should be provided by schools, and
10 percent do not.
   Americans also think school health clinics should be allowed to
refer sexually active students to outside family planning clinics,
Saunier said. According to the poll, 80 percent favor establishing
links between schools and family planning clinics, while 18 percent
oppose the idea, she said.
   The research found that 73 percent of those interviewed
supported making birth control information and contraceptives
available in school health clinics, while 25 percent opposed it.

   Evelyn Vega, a single mother and former
welfare recipient, considers herself living proof of the gains she
believes other women can make under the welfare bill signed by
President Reagan on Thursday.
   Three years ago, Ms. Vega, 28, of Stamford, Conn., was on
welfare and could not read or write, much less hold a job.
   Now she manages a fast-food store, has her own car and hopes to
send her three daughters to college.
   Other welfare recipients can do the same, she said shortly after
attending the White House Rose Garden ceremony where Reagan signed
the measure that will offer welfare recipients education, training
and work programs.
   ``I'm a happy person now that I'm working and I'm not on
welfare,'' said Ms. Vega. ``Now that the government did all this,
it could be a chance to help a lot of women like me.''
   Ms. Vega, whose parents separated when she was young, said she
largely raised herself after running away from home at age 10. She
and an older sister traveled from Puerto Rico to several U.S.
states, and Ms. Vega became pregnant for the first time at age 15.
   Three years ago, when all of her daughters were old enough to
attend school, Ms. Vega went to her welfare caseworker and said she
wanted to get off public assistance.
   ``I was so lonely. I was so scared,'' she said. ``I didn't want
to sit there with my girls going to school and me doing nothing.''
   Ms. Vega got a tutor, Page Oristano, from the Literacy
Volunteers of America, who began to teach her reading, writing and
basic skills such as how to look up a number in the telephone book.
   Eventually another agency agreed to help her find an entry-level
job in a fast-food store, and the manager there decided to help her
train for a management job.
   She passed the management test a month ago with 98 of 100
possible points. Several months earlier, Ms. Vega received her last
welfare check.
   ``I'm a single woman and I'm just taking care of my girls and
I'm happy,'' Ms. Vega said. ``Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning,
but it's OK.''
   She reads at the third- or fourth-grade level, and is more
proficient with material which is job related. She has a good
chance of finishing high school, Ms. Oristano said.
   Ms. Vega's goal is to send her daughters to college and
eventually attend college herself.
   Ms. Vega said she is convinced other welfare mothers can get off
public assistance.
   ``They've got to say, `I'm going to do it. I'm going to stick
with it and I'm not going to go back,''' she said.
   The Family Support Act signed by Reagan Thursday provides money
to states and requires them to offer education and job training to
women with children age 3 and over, and to put new pressure on
non-custodial parents to pay child support.
   The incentive to get off welfare ``has to come from the person
because the programs are there,'' Ms. Vega said.
   She and Ms. Oristano attended the bill-signing ceremony under
the auspices of the United Way, which supports many of the programs
that aided her.

<HEAD>U.S.-Funded Airlift Begins Relief Flights in Sudan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout with new material and editing. Changes

<BYLINE>By MOHAMED OSMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.-funded airlift started carrying
food and medical supplies on Thursday to thousands of starving
people in war-torn southern Sudan, Sudanese and United Nations
officials said.
   A U.N. official said the airlift aimed to send 12 planes daily
to transport supplies to the towns of Mairam, Kadugli, Muglad and
Abyei. Food was reported to have run out in Abyei last Wednesday.
   Government and U.N. officials implied that southern rebels
promised airlift organizers not to shoot down the planes.
Washington says the guerrillas in the past attacked civilian planes
and truck convoys, and interfered with the International Red Cross
in its effort to work out relief programs.
   The airlift began after Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi met in
Khartoum with U.S. Ambassador G. Norman Anderson and Walter
Bollinger, an official of the U.S. Agency for International
Development (AID).
   The agreement broke a deadlock between foreign aid donors and
the government, which had resisted delivery of food supplies into
rebel areas.
   ``The situation in Abyei is very bad. It's now the rainy season,
and the airport is only a strip of sand and stones. We don't give a
time limit, but we would like to carry out the relief operation as
quickly as possible,'' the U.N. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press.
   Abyei's normal population of 10,000 shot up to 40,000 as people
in rural areas fled the fierce fighting to the town's relative
safety. Abyei will be virtually isolated for the next two months
because of the rainy season.
   An AP reporter saw a government report covering the last few
months which indicates that dozens of people in Abyei have been
dying each week.
   Ibrahim Mohamed Osman, secretary-general of the Sudanese Red
Crescent, said townspeople and refugees in Abyei ate the last of
their food on Wednesday and that about 700 metric tons of sorghum,
oil and cereal had to be sent there.
   The Red Crescent is Sudan's equivalent of the Red Cross.
   The southern rebellion began five years ago, with the mainly
Christian and animist rebels demanding autonomy and administrative
and economic reforms from the Moslem-dominated government in the
north.
   The official Sudan News Agency said most flights are going to
Abyei, 500 miles southwest of Khartoum, and that supplies destined
for the other towns will be transshipped from there.
   It is the first major foreign civilian relief effort in two
years, since Operation Rainbow, a problem-plagued U.N. program that
finally got off the ground in October 1986.
   A major stumbling block to relief efforts then was a threat from
the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army to shoot down relief
planes, claiming the government would use them for military
purposes.
   More than 70 people died when rebel gunners shot down two planes
at that time.
   Asked if organizers of the latest airlift had contacted the
Liberation Army about safe conduct for the flights, the U.N.
official said: ``We'd rather not comment on the issue.''
   When reminded of a Liberation Army threat made three weeks ago
to shoot any plane flying in the south, the U.N. official said:
``That was another time. Now it is something else.''
   Osman said planes that took off Thursday carried medicine,
health experts and high-nutrition biscuits to ``people who might
soon starve if food doesn't reach them in the next few days. People
are suffering from hunger and famine is eminent.''
   He said the only hospital in Abyei was deserted last April and
basic medical care was ``nil.''
   Organizers have not disclosed the duration of the operation or
how much food and medication are being flown south, paid for by AID.
   According to a cable from the U.S. ambassador in Khartoum on the
relief plan, however, 90 tons of food will be flown initially into
Abyei, with more to follow. The plan calls for 1,500 metric tons of
food to be trucked from Kadugli west to Muglad and Babanusa. The
Associated Press obtained a copy of the cable.
   The U.N. official said that in addition to the Sudanese
government and the AID organization, the operation involves UNICEF,
the U.N. children's fund; the World Food Program; the U.N.
Development Program; the Red Crescent and private agencies.
   The operation began a week after Sudanese and U.N. officials
toured Abyei. A Sudanese official with the delegation, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said there was a tacit agreement to avoid
publicizing the operation.
   The rebels claim to control 90 percent of the southern
countryside. Fighting has forced more than 820,000 southerners to
flee to army protection in southern towns, northern cities and even
into neighboring Ethiopia.

<HEAD>Former Ambassador Calls Soviets `A Failed Society'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Ambassador Arthur Hartman on
Thursday called the Soviet Union ``a failed society'' and said it
may grant some independence to its Baltic republics to perk up the
country's economy and to satisfy national aspirations.
   However, Hartman said the steps toward more local control in
Lithuania, Latvia and Esthonia could turn Moscow back on the road
to a more authoritarian regime if the Baltics tried to escape from
the Soviet system.
   ``Eventually, this could be a cataclysmic event,'' he said.
   Hartman, who left his post in Moscow in 1985, was recently in
the Soviet Union. He said it remains ``pretty much a dead-hand
operation'' despite moves by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
consolidate his political power.
   ``It is a failed society, and a failed system of central control
and central planning,'' Hartman said at a seminar sponsored by the
Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.
   He said Gorbachev was determined to improve the economic
situation throughout the country by loosening Moscow's control over
the various republics and their communist parties.
   ``I think there has been a decision that the way to handle the
Baltics, and the way to get the Baltics to be a kind of economic
locomotive for the country, which is what it could be, is to give
them a kind of national freedom,'' the ex-ambassador said.
   Hartman said the people in the three republics could set the
pace for economic reform because they ``have a memory of how to do
things in a way the Russians don't.''
   As a result, he said, the Soviets are proceeding ``in a more or
less autonomous direction'' for the Baltics.
   And yet, Hartman said, Moscow cannot allow the Baltics to get
away from the Soviet system.
   ``I think something can happen which will set the Soviets back
on the road to a much more authoritarian kind of regime,'' he said.
   On human rights, Hartman denounced as ``crazy'' congressional
attempt to withhold economic benefits unless the Soviets improve
their human rights record.
   ``The people who are talking about linkage want to stop any
development in the relationship'' between the superpowers, he said.
``If they tried it in Stalinist times I could understand it.'' But
he said that under Gorbachev the Soviets were stepping up Jewish
emigration because they want a better relationship with the West.

   George Bush has expanded his lead over Michael
Dukakis in Arizona, according to a new poll that shows the
Republican presidential nominee doubling the margin he held over
his Democratic rival in June.
   According to the poll, conducted by The Arizona Republic
following last week's vice presidential debate, Bush leads Dukakis
54-34 percent with 12 percent undecided. In June, Bush led a
similar Republic poll 47 percent to 37 percent.
   In addition, the degree of support for Bush was stronger in the
current poll than for Dukakis. Three of every five Bush supporters
said they favored him strongly, while the Dukakis camp was evenly
split between strong and moderate supporters.
   The Republic poll, published in Thursday's editions, is based on
telephone interviews conducted Oct. 6-9 with 808 randomly selected
registered voters. Of those surveyed, 301 said they are registered
Democrats and 397 described themselves as registered Republicans.
   The margin of error was plus or minus five percentage points for
Republicans and plus or minus six percentage points for Democrats.

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Republican presidential campaign
has pulled out heavy artillery in the form of retired U.S. Air
Force Gen. Chuck Yeager to warn Texans that ``liberal Democrats''
will take away jobs from the state's defense industry.
   In a television advertisement airing this week in Texas, Yeager
warns that the 300,000 Texas jobs related to the defense industry
could be jeopardized by Democrats who advocate cuts in defense
spending.
   But Yeager, the first man to break the sound barrier, has worked
for the past six years as a consultant to Northrop Corp. of
California, a competitor of General Dynamics Corp. The Fort Worth
Division of General Dynamics is one of the largest defense
employers in the state, with 27,000 workers.
   Republican National Committee spokesman Kathryn Murray said she
wasn't aware that Yeager was a consultant to Northrop but that it
was irrelevant.
   ``The point of the ad is that General Yeager has first-hand
knowledge of what it takes to have a strong defense and he believes
the policies of the Republicans are more in sync with making that
happen,'' she said. ``He speaks from the heart about the defense of
the nation.''

<DATELINE>MASADA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel ended yearlong celebrations of its
40th year Thursday with a dramatic concert at the windswept
foothills of Masada, where Jewish Zealots committed mass suicide
rather than surrender to the Romans.
   ``Their refusal to yield became a symbol and legacy of courage
for the state of Israel in its revival,'' President Chaim Herzog
said in a speech before the concert. ``Our presence here tonight
and the beginning of our fifth decade of our independence is proof
of our promise that Masada will not fall again.''
   The festivities were marred by the 10-month Palestinian uprising
in the occupied lands, which led to a 13 percent drop in tourism.
   ``The damage from the point of view of image has also been
enormous,'' said Micha Gidron, deputy director-general of Israel's
Tourism Ministry.
   He said it was hoped the concert would revitalize tourism and
``return people's confidence in visiting Israel.''
   Yosef Yadin, son of the late archaeologist Yigal Yadin, who
excavated Masada, opened the ceremonies reading from the final
speech of Eleazar Ben Yair, commander of the 1,000 Jewish warriors
and their families who stood off 15,000 Romans for nearly two years.
   Facing certain defeat, Eleazar called on the survivors to commit
mass suicide and destroy the fortress at Masada, except for its
food store.
   ``It will testify when we are dead that we did not perish
through want but because, in keeping with our intitial resolution,
we chose death to slavery,'' Eleazar is said to have told his
followers.
   Zubin Mehta conducted the 120-member Israel Philharmonic
Orchestra and a choir of 170 in peforming Gustav Mahler's Second
Symphony, known as the ``Resurrection.''
   Mehta said the music was chosen to symbolize the suffering and
rebirth of the Jewish people. The first movement begins with a
funeral dirge and moves to a dramatic conclusion symbolizing the
Day of Judgment.
   The men first cut the throats of their wives and children. Then
10 men were chosen by lot to kill the other men. More lots were
drawn, and one man killed his nine companions and then threw
himself on the sword.
   The ancient monument, which overlooks the Dead Sea, is a major
tourist and pilgrimage site, symbolizing Jewish commitment to the
land of Israel. In recent years, Israeli military officers have
been sworn in at ceremonies conducted atop the 1,300-foot-high
monument.
   Israel had hoped the celebrations, which began after the start
of the Jewish new year in September 1987, would bring 1.6 million
tourists. Earnings were projected at $350 million more than in
1987, when 1.5 million tourists brought in $1.5 billion.
   Instead, Gidron said, only about 1.3 million tourists are
expected by year's end.
   About 4,000 Israelis, including Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
and his political rival, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, attended
the concert in the Judean Desert hills, 95 miles southeast of
Jerusalem.
   The price of tickets ranged from $150 to $960.
   Security was tight, with cars banned from the site and shuttle
buses taking people to the staging area.
   The celebration included a sound and light show, fireworks
synchronized to music and a procession of 400 torch-carrying
Israeli youths who climbed to the top of the monument.
   French entertainer Yves Montand and American actor Gregory Peck
were hosts for the program, which included a reading of Roman
historian Josephus Flavius' account of the fall of Masada in 73
A.D. to Roman legionnaires.

   A Navy admiral has ordered a court martial for
a female lieutenant who has refused to provide a urine sample for a
drug test ``under the direct observation'' of another woman.
   Rear Adm. James D. Cossey, the chief of naval technical
training, ordered the special court martial on Thursday for Lt.
Elizabeth Susan Unger, accusing her of one count of willfully
disobeying a lawful order, said Lt. Brian Cullin. a Navy spokesman.
   ``The court martial is to be conducted at the Great Lakes Naval
Training Center, Ill., where Lt. Unger is assigned, on a date not
determined as yet,'' added Cullin.
   ``The maximum punishment, if convicted, is six months
confinement and forfeiture of two-thirds pay for six months.''
   A special court martial differs from a general court martial in
that the presiding officer cannot order a bad conduct discharge. A
conviction at special court martial, however, would still likely
lead to a general or administrative discharge for a Navy officer.
   Unger has told Navy officials she supports drug testing and is
willing to submit a urine sample, but refuses to do so if she must
be observed in the process.
   ``I told my commanding officer that I can't be observed,'' she
told The Washington Post in an interview last month.
   ``I think it's demeaning and degrading. I said I think it's
wrong. He said that we make certain sacrifices, we give up certain
privileges in the Navy.''
   A civilian attorney retained by Unger, Gary R. Myers, has argued
the Navy's urinalysis policy should be changed because ``a woman
officer has to disrobe; a male officer does not.''
   ``A woman officer has to face that observer eyeball to eyeball;

   Myers also argues that forcing officers to disrobe in front of
enlisted personnel flies in the face of the military's strict
policies against fraternization between the two.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis holds a
49 percent to 40 percent lead over Vice President George Bush,
according to a telephone survey conducted by the Buffalo News.
   The sampling by Political-Media Research Inc. of Washington,
D.C., consisted of telephone interviews Monday and Tuesday with 850
registered voters across the state. It has a margin of error of
plus or minus four points.
   Vice President Bush led in every upstate area, including the
heavily Democratic Buffalo area, which has not voted for a
Republican presidential candidate since 1972.
   The poll showed Bush leading 48 percent to 41 percent in Buffalo
and 50 percent to 38 percent in Albany, another traditional
Democratic stronghold.
   Dukakis carried a commanding 62 percent to 28 percent lead in
the populous and overwhelmingly Democratic New York City region,
however.

   The government closed 9,800 schools
across the country Thursday in an effort to halt increasing student
violence against security forces.
   A government announcement said the schools would stay closed
until Oct. 24. Colombo University also was closed for a month.
   Thousands of students took to the streets Wednesday and set fire
to 49 state-owned buses in protests over the death of a student who
was shot by police and over the arrest of 113 students, police said.
   Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
protesters either were members or sympathizers of the People's
Liberation Front, a body of radical Sinhalese.
   The group opposes government efforts to reach a settlement with
Tamil militants fighting for an independent homeland in this island
nation. The Front has been blamed for more than 450 deaths since
India and Sri Lanka signed a July 1987 accord to end the Tamil
strife.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's population of 16
million, claim the Sinhalese majority discriminates against them in
employment and in the military.
   Tamil rebels killed six Indian soldiers in northern Sri Lanka on
Wednesday by detonating buried explosives, military officials said
Thursday. India maintains an estimated 47,000 troops in Sri Lanka
to disarm those Tamil militants who refused to surrender their
weapons and abide by the July accord.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Financing Plan For Indian Relocation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Thursday completed congressional
action on legislation to increase funding authorization for the
relocation of Navajo and Hopi Indians in the desert Southwest and
to drop a ban on improving and repairing homes on tribal lands.
   The bill, which had been passed earlier by the House, was
approved by the Senate on a voice vote and sent to the White House
for President Reagan's signature.
   The legislation would increase the authorization for incentive
payments to encourage the relocation from $7 million to $13 million
in order to provide the funds during an extra four-year period
needed to complete the necessary housing.
   It also raises the ceiling for relocation, housing, moving and
other payments from $15 million annually to $30 million through the
1991 fiscal year which begins on Oct. 1, 1990.
   The actual amounts to be provided will be the subject of
separate appropriations bills.
   The two reservations cover parts of Arizona and New Mexico.
   The legislation would allow home repairs and improvements on the
homes of Hopis and Navajos located on the other tribe's lands if
the work is needed to assure the residents' health and safety.
   Each tribe could petition the other for permission to carry out
the work. Disputes would be settled by the Interior Department. New
construction would continue to be banned.
   The bill would also establish a Navajo Rehabilitation Trust Fund
to pay for infrastructure and social and economic benefits for
Navajo families that have relocated from Hopi lands.
   The fund would be authorized at $10 million a year from fiscal
1990 through fiscal 1995. Net income from Navajo surface and
mineral rights in New Mexico would be required to be deposited in
the fund.

   Rounding up gifts for a English princess
proved challenging to members of this southeastern Nebraska
community, but it was nothing compared with trying to give them to
her.
   The Gage County visitors' committee threw a baby shower for
Princess Beatrice, the daughter born Aug. 8 to Prince Andrew and
Sarah, the Duchess of York, because the community and the princess
share the same name.
   The Sept. 1 shower yielded crocheted bibs, booties and blankets,
high-topped tennis shoes, a key to the city of 13,000 and a college
scholarship.
   The gift package, weighing about 50 pounds, was bound up and
sent off by United Parcel Service to London. Buckingham Palace
returned it, said Diane Schwenke, president of the Beatrice Chamber
of Commerce, because it's palace policy not to accept gifts.
   Working through diplomatic channels, Ms. Schwenke decided to
send the gifts to the Hospital for Sick Children in London, where
the gifts were donated in Princess Beatrice's name.
   A flurry of correspondence from Ms. Schwenke to Buckingham
Palace to explain the detoured gifts and the community's intentions
got derailed by a British mail strike.
   Once the strike was over, however, it didn't take long to get
the response from the palace, Ms. Schwenke said Thursday. A note
from a lady-in-waiting to the Duchess conveyed gratitude for the
``kind and generous presents,'' she said.
   Ms. Schwenke said she wouldn't be surprised to get a letter from
hospital officials too, though she said she's not sure what they
will do with all the gifts, including an American flag, an atlas
with Beatrice marked in, and a Beatrice library card.

   Mickey Mouse showed up in a cornfield
here to harvest his ears.
   The Pitzenberger family _ father Dick and brothers Ted, Rick and
Joe _ worked together to plant, cultivate and harvest a 238-acre
cornfield in the shape of Mickey Mouse's famous profile.
   Disney officials, who came up with the idea, used it as a
promotion for the mouse's 60th birthday. They settled on a field in
northern Iowa because it lies beneath the routes of dozens of daily
cross-country airline flights.
   After planting and cultivating the field last spring, the job of
picking the Mickey Mouse field started three weeks ago. Disney
officials came back to Iowa last week with Mickey to help harvest
the crop.
   The mouse tried his hand at harvesting.
   ``We had a little more fun with him,'' Ted Pitzenberger said
Thursday. ``He showed up to run the combine for a couple of rows.''
   The effort proved to more than just a promotional stunt for
Disney. Officials from seven towns near the field picked up on the
idea as a way to show how small-town Iowa is trying to recover from
the 1980s farm recession.
   ``Now that we're picking Mickey, there are Mickey Mouse corn
kernels in jars and Mickey Mouse ears of corn going around the
area. So it's staying with us.''

<HEAD>NASA Study: Days Get Milliseconds Longer As Earth Spins More
Slowly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers who studied ancient Chinese
chronicles of solar eclipses found that a day is now seven
hundredths of a second longer than it was nearly 4,000 years ago
because the Earth is spinning more slowly.
   The length of a day ``just keeps getting longer and longer,''
said Kevin Pang, who conducted the study as an astronomer at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Just as a spinning ice skater slows down by extending her arms,
Earth's rotation on its axis slows as tidal interactions make the
moon orbit Earth more quickly and become more distant from it, he
said Wednesday.
   ``Four billion years ago, the moon was only one-third as far
away as it is now, and the day was only eight hours long at the
time,'' said Pang, whose study will be published soon in the
British journal Vistas in Astronomy.
   Pang and his co-authors determined that, compared to today, the
length of a day was 2.2 hundredths of a second shorter in A.D. 532,
4.2 hundredths of a second shorter in 899 B.C., and seven
hundredths of a second shorter in 1876 B.C.
   Other studies have shown Earth's rotation varies slightly over
time because the oceans and atmosphere produce drag on the planet's
topography, and because molten rock within the Earth sloshes
against solid rock to produce a similar drag.
   Knowing how Earth's rotation rate changes ``helps you understand
things like the interaction between the ocean, solid Earth and
atmosphere, and tells you something about the interior of the
Earth,'' Pang said.
   While ancient Chinese annals report thousands of eclipses, the
researchers limited themselves to those that occurred at sunrise or
sunset, allowing them to compute the time of the eclipses.
   Knowing the times, along with the fact the eclipses were visible
from China, the scientists were able to calculate how much Earth's
rotation has slowed since the dates the eclipses occurred.
   For example, had the day always been 24 hours long, the 899 B.C.
eclipse would have been seen in the Middle East instead of China,
Pang explained.
   Pang's calculations of the rate at which Earth's rotation is
slowing are consistent with previous studies, but extend further
back in time. The oldest Arabian and Babylonian records of solar
eclipses date to about 700 B.C.
   Pang's findings on the 899 B.C. eclipse first were reported in
early 1987. In that study, he and his colleagues studied ancient
Chinese chronicles, called the Bamboo Annals, which mentioned a
time when ``the day dawned twice.''
   By performing a computer simulation of the history of the
Earth's rotation around the sun, they determined the phrase meant
that the moon eclipsed the sun just after dawn on April 21, 899
B.C. That let them figure out the Earth's rotation rate at the time.
   In the new NASA-funded study, they were able to compute the time
of the 532 and the 1876 B.C. eclipses.
   Some people incorrectly assume Earth's gravity pulls the moon
closer to Earth, but that is not the case, Pang said.

   Prosecutors argued Thursday that a county's
problems do not excuse two people from taking hostages at a
newspaper, but the defense said Eddie Hatcher and Timothy Jacobs
saw no alternative.
   ``Conceding an argument that there are serious problems in
Robeson County that need to be addressed, that does not excuse the
action taken here,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney John Bruce.
   ``We're not saying that because there were problems in the past
(in Robeson County) that this was a violent protest,'' countered
defense lawyer Lewis Pitts, one of Jacobs' attorneys. ``That's what
the government would like you to think, but it ignores the real and
immediate threat to Timothy Jacobs and Eddie Hatcher.''
   The arguments were held before a federal jury began its
deliberations in the case at 3:50 p.m. after more than an hour of
instructions from U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle.
   After about 45 minutes of deliberations, jurors asked for and
received definitions for ``knowingly,'' ``willfully'' and
``maliciously.'' They deliberated until 5 p.m. and were to resume
Friday.
   Hatcher, 30, and Jacobs, 20, both Tuscarora Indians from
Pembroke, face charges of making and possessing illegal firearms,
conspiring to make those weapons and making a bomb threat. A
federal charge of hostage-taking was dismissed earlier this week
against Jacobs but remains against Hatcher.
   The defendants have argued that their lives were in jeopardy
because of information they had linking law enforcement officers to
drug trafficking in Robeson County. They claimed they had to take
hostages at The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton to publicize
their case and save their lives.
   The two held as many as 20 people during their 10-hour siege on
Feb. 1. No one was injured.
   The judge rejected a request by defense attorneys Wednesday to
discuss self-defense in his instructions to the jury, which will
follow closing arguments.
   ``Can you imagine 60,000 frightened, abandoned people crying
out?'' Hatcher appealed to the jury in a closing statement partly
written by his attorney, William Kunstler. ``From 150 miles away,
they're crying out. Some are faint, they're tired, they're wore
out. Please don't abandon me and Timmy.''
   Kunstler could not appear at the trial because he is tied up in
a New York case.
   ``Mr. Bruce talked about the Constitution this morning and how
it allows peaceful protest,'' Hatcher said. ``When those sworn to
uphold the Constitution won't, what do you do?''
   Hatcher's voice cracked and began to quaver, bringing sobs from
his supporters in the courtroom and tears to Jacobs and his defense
attorneys, who were seated opposite the jury.
   But Bruce said, ``If everything in this whole scenario they have
spun out is true, it still does not justify their putting innocent
people in terror of their lives.''
   Pitts said taking hostages was ``a drastic action'' he was not
trying to minimize, but that the intentions of Hatcher and Jacobs
were critical to the case.
   ``If you put aside the fear and impact on the individuals (at
the newspaper), what it comes down to is if they had a guilty mind
or evil intent,'' he said.

<HEAD>Senators Urge U.N. Action On Chemical Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bipartisan group of nearly 60 senators urged
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Thursday to
launch an international crusade to prevent the use and spread of
outlawed chemical weapons.
   In a meeting in New York with Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., the
secretary general was given a letter signed by 59 senators urging a
``coordinated response by the international community'' against
chemical weaponry.
   ``Over the past decade, we have seen both the spread and use of
chemical weapons gain increasing momentum,'' stated the letter, a
copy of which was released by Kassebaum's office in Washington.
   ``This is a problem of international dimension. It is critical
that we move as a body of nations to rebuild the barrier to
chemical weapons use and reassert the principle that chemical
warfare is unacceptable,'' the senators said.
   A copy of the letter, which was written by Kassebaum and Sens.
William Cohen, R-Maine; Bill Bradley, D-N.J.; and Joseph Biden,
D-Del., also was sent to President Reagan.
   The lawmakers endorsed Reagan's recent call for an international
conference to determine how to enforce a 1925 protocol that bans
chemical weapons in international conflicts. Reagan, in his
farewell speech to the U.N. General Assembly last month, condemned
the use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war.
   In addition, the senators suggested a broadening of controls on
exports of materials and technologies that can be used in the
manufacture of chemical weapons. A number of Western nations have
an informal set of export controls, but the lawmakers said those
can only be effective if the Soviet Union, Eastern Bloc nations and
emerging industrialized countries join in the effort to prevent the
spread of chemical weapons.
   Finally, the senators recommended the United Nations adopt a
policy of international sanctions against any country that uses the
banned weapons and called for a system that makes it easier for
U.N. teams to investigate cases of suspected use.
   ``We strongly believe that unless the international community
moves swiftly, perhaps the most serious threat we face is that the
main lesson from the Iran-Iraq war ... will be that chemical
weapons do work and states that use them can get away with it,''
the senators wrote.

   Sunny skies extended over much of the nation Thursday, although
it rained along the lower Great Lakes and the northern and central
Pacific Coast.
   Early morning temperatures were unseasonably cold over the
eastern portion of the nation and freezing temperatures reached
across the southern Appalachians.
   Sunny skies helped noon temperatures reach the 40s in Ohio and
Indiana and the 50s across Tennessee.
   Temperatures were much higher in the upper Midwest. Noon
temperatures were in the 50s and 60s over the upper Mississippi
Valley, in the 60s and 70s through the Dakotas, Delaware, eastern
Maryland, eastern interior Virginia, northeast Georgia and the
inland portion of the Carolinas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 32
degrees at Montpelier, Vt., to 92 degrees at Gila Bend, Ariz. The
low temperature for the nation Thursday morning was 18 degrees at
Elkins, W.Va.; Lone Rock, Wis.; and Marquette, Mich.
   The forecast for Friday called for continued showers in northern
New England, scattered rain along the northern Pacific Coast, and
cloudy skies across the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah and
the southern coast of California. Sunny skies were expected across
much of the remainder of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 40s over northern New
England into northeast New York state, in the 50s and 60s in
central New England, Georgia, the Great Lakes and the upper Ohio
Valley. Highs were expected in the 60s from the northern two thirds
of the Pacific Coast across the Great Basin, the region west of the
central Rockies and the northern Rockies. Temperatures in the 80s
were expected for southern Florida and the southern and central
Plains. Highs across the desert Southwest were forecast for the 80s
to low 90s. Highs over the remainder of the nation were expected to
be in the 70s.

   Three residents of the San Francisco Bay
area have taken out a full-page ad in the New York Times urging the
media to pressure Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle
into disclosing his records from college and law school.
   ``Release Dan Quayle's College Records Now,'' read the banner of
the full-page, $16,000 advertisment in Thursday's editions of the
Times.
   The ad said it was sponsored by the ``Independent Committee on
Presidential Qualifications.'' It was signed by author Orville
Schell, entrepreneur Paul Hawken, and actor Peter Coyote.
   A total of about $65,000, raised from personal and donated
funds, will have been spent before the election, Coyote said. The
group is planning a second ad in the Times and an ad in USA Today,
Coyote said.
   The ad was topped by coupons that readers were asked to fill in
and mail to the committee, a radio network and a newspaper.
   Quayle has refused to make his grades public. He acknowledges he
was a less than stellar student but says he doesn't want reporters
scrutinizing his academic records. Quayle also insisted he got into
law school ``fair and square'' after a newspaper reported that he
entered by way of a program intended to help minority and other
disadvantaged students.

<HEAD>New Premier Wants Economy Restructured Under Central Control</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One day after taking office,
Premier Ladislav Adamec on Thursday demanded economic reform under
a strong central government and warned his ministers their jobs
depended on concrete results.
   President Gustav Husak swore in Adamec and his Cabinet Wednesday
evening in a reshuffle that added 10 new faces to the 20-member
government.
   It was the biggest shake-up in 20 years and saw the departure of
Lubomir Strougal, who led the government for more than 18 years,
and Foreign Minister Bohuslav Chnoupek.
   Adamec told his Cabinet at its first meeting that the Central
Committee, which sets policy for the ruling Communist Party,
strongly criticized Strougal's government for the present state of
the economy.
   It ``sharply criticized a number of branches (of the economy)
for which we bear responsibility,'' Adamec said, according to the
official news agency CTK.
   ``A number of suggestions were made on how to improve the
activity of the governments and ministries.''
   He indicated the government was under pressure from the party to
achieve concrete results that would be felt by a population
accustomed to adequate supplies of consumer goods and services.
   Czechoslovakia has not faced the economic stagnation and
declining living standards that plague communist neighbors Poland
and Hungary, but economic growth has slowed and much of its
production processes are outdated.
   ``It is our duty to respond to all suggestions and demands as
soon as possible ... by energetic efforts to provide a remedy for
the shortcomings in the criticized branches,'' CTK quoted Adamec as
saying.
   He emphasized the role of the government as ``the state economic
center.''
   Adamec cautioned that changes would not come overnight. He also
said the government would be judged ``not ... by the extent of
personnel changes but by the results achieved.''
   He warned against ignoring ``growing discontent'' among the
population and said the government could not be indifferent to poor
quality production or short supplies of goods and medicines.
   His emphasis on the need to keep consumers well supplied
indicated that the Prague leadership hopes to achieve economic
reform without making political concessions, as the leaderships in
Warsaw and Budapest have done.

<HEAD>Researcher Says He Deciphered Peary's Own Notes Showing False
Claim</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Baltimore astronomer and historian says he's
found long-suppressed evidence that shows explorer Robert E. Peary
was not the first man to reach the North Pole, but had stopped 121
miles short of his goal.
   Dennis Rawlins, a 51-year-old researcher fascinated by the Peary
expedition, said Thursday he had deciphered Peary's detailed
navigational notes from a document that indicates he and his
dogsled were off course.
   Rawlins believes Peary felt pressured to declare his 1909 polar
expedition a success, but privately instructed his wife to ``treat
this (the document) as your most precious possession and never let
it out of your hands,'' except to silence an archrival who had
falsely claimed to have beaten Peary to the North Pole.
   ``He had the task of hoaxing the world while under the harshest
spotlight, all the while accusing his archrival (explorer Frederick
A. Cook) of faking the very same attainment. The amazing thing is
he had the guts and the intelligence to pull it off,'' Rawlins said.
   ``There had to have been a core of integrity to him or he
wouldn't have kept this record,'' he said.
   Officials of the National Geographic Society, which backed
Peary's expedition, said they would examine the document. But the
society said in a statement, ``We believe Mr. Rawlins has been too
quick to cry fake.''
   Last month, National Geographic Magazine published an article by
another writer acknowledging Peary might have been 30 to 60
nautical miles from his destination.
   Rawlins claimed Isaiah Bowman, the director of the New
York-based American Geographical Society, the professional society
of geographers, had seen Peary's secret papers in 1935 at the Peary
family home in Eagle Island, Maine, after Peary's daughter became
concerned about published attacks on her father's trip.
   Rawlins, who is publishing his findings in his own journal, Dio,
said he stumbled upon the evidence on Sept. 3, 1987, while
reviewing the papers of Bowman, a Peary admirer and the former
president of Johns Hopkins University from 1935 to his death in
1950.
   After having them verified by an astronomer, Bowman suppressed
the papers as well, telling eminent geographers of the day the
papers backed Peary's claim to have reached the pole, Rawlins said.
   Despite the alleged coverup, Rawlins said Peary remains the
greatest U.S. explorer, having discovered the northernmost point of
land in the world, Cape Jesup in northern Greenland, after
surviving an obstacle-laden route.
   Rawlins said Peary's secret document reveals ``he was somewhat
short and a good distance to the right,'' of the North Pole.
   In 1973, Rawlins published a book, ``Peary at the North Pole:
Fact or Fiction?,'' providing evidence against Peary's claim.

   The Senate on Thursday voted to allow capital
punishment for drug-related killings, as lawmakers lurched past
procedural snarls and finally began debating a $2.6 billion drug
bill.
   The capital punishment language, retained in the legislation on
a 64-25 vote, was just one of many provisions in the 600-page,
campaign-season measure that would strengthen the government's
arsenal against drug offenders.
   The lawmakers easily defeated two other efforts to weaken the
death penalty language, and then adopted by an 88-0 vote a
provision that would allow fines of up to $10,000 against people
who possess even small amounts of illegal drugs.
   The failed effort by liberals to strip the death penalty
language from the bill was a major step toward extending federal
capital punishment statutes because there is similar language in
the harsher, House-passed version of the legislation. Congressional
leaders want to send the drug legislation to President Reagan
before adjourning for the year in the next few days.
   ``The death penalty is necessary and long overdue as a weapon in
the incredible butchery that is taking place on America's
streets,'' said Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   Liberals from both parties, however, derided capital punishment
as an ineffective vestige of less enlightened times.
   ``The desire for vengeance, for eye-for-an-eye justice, is a
principle and a mentality unworthy of civilized government and of
this body,'' said Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.
   The bill would allow capital punishment for drug traffickers who
kill civilians or law enforcement officers. Hatfield's amendment,
which was defeated 64-25, would have removed the death penalty from
the bill and replaced it with mandatory life imprisonment without
possibility of parole.
   Consideration of the legislation was delayed for days while
lawmakers squabbled over more than 100 amendments they wanted to
attach. Added pressure was being placed on legislators by the
calendar, since 33 Senate seats and all 435 House seats are being
contested in the Nov. 8 elections and lawmakers are eager to
campaign full-time at home.
   By Thursday afternoon, legislative leaders seemed to have pared
the list of amendments down to around 60 and were ready to fold
some of them into the bill and debate others separately.
   Two of the most contentious proposals, advanced by
conservatives, seemed to have been resolved in closed-door
negotiations.
   An effort to restrict the right of convicted criminals to appeal
their sentences on procedural grounds was toned down with an
agreement that Congress would reconsider the question next year,
after a Supreme Court-appointed commission issues a report.
   Another provision was altered that would have allowed courts to
use evidence seized by police with no warrants. Instead, the
amendment would codify a 1984 Supreme Court ruling that evidence
seized in ``good faith'' by officers could be used even if their
warrant was defective.
   Many other amendments awaited action, including language
strengthening federal laws against child pornography, requiring
warning labels on alcoholic beverage containers, mandating random
drug testing for first-time drivers' license applicants and
allowing the loss of many federal benefits for repeat drug
offenders.
   Overall, the legislation would devote 60 percent of its
resources toward treatment and prevention programs, and 40 percent
toward law enforcement efforts.
   It would provide $676 million for federal agencies to hire 3,287
new law enforcement officers, purchase new equipment and build
additional prisons. Another $275 million would be made available to
state and local authorities.
   An additional $1 billion would be provided for treatment and
prevention, allowing programs to handle an additional 600,000 drug
abusers annually over five years. Money would be distributed
locally to train health professionals, to improve existing or build
new treatment centers, and to train teachers involved in drug-abuse
education.
   Federal penalties for repeat drug offenders and for narcotics
crimes involving children or firearms would be increased. A
Cabinet-level federal ``drug czar'' would be created, federal
contracts would be prohibited with businesses that could not
maintain a drug-free workplace, and public housing projects would
be permitted to evict tenants who are drug offenders.
   But there was a question where the money would come from.
Lawmakers said $1.4 billion of the measure's money would be spent
over the next 12 months. Without a new source of revenue _ which
they so far have refused to provide _ they said they only knew
where about $450 million of that amount would come from.
   Lawmakers and aides, however, said Thursday that there was a
chance legislators would pass a supplemental spending bill
providing extra money _ and adding to the deficit _ next week or
when the 101st Congress commences in January.
   Reagan favors the tougher House bill, which was passed Sept. 22.
It contains some provisions imposing tough penalties that are
missing in the Senate bill.
   House-Senate negotiators will have to agree to a compromise bill
before it can be sent to the White House for Reagan's signature.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union named as new
ambassador to Kabul its first deputy foreign minister, Yuli
Vorontsov, an Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday.
   The appointment of such a high-level official appeared designed
to emphasize the importance the Soviet Union continues to place on
Afghanistan, despite withdrawing its troops, Western diplomats said.
   ``It puts a guy with a great deal of clout here to show how much
they support the place,'' one diplomat said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman, when asked why Moscow had
chosen someone of such high rank, said it meant Afghanistan was an
important country. Under briefing rules, the spokesman is not
identified.
   The spokesman also denied claims made in neighboring Pakistan
that the Moslem guerrillas battling Afghan government troops shot
down five Afghan air force planes and helicopters last week.
   Pakistan is headquarters for the U.S.-supported guerrillas.
   Vorontsov will replace Nicholai Igorytchev, a member of the
Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee, whose departure
appeared quite abrupt.
   Igorytchev's farewell reception took place at midday today,
barely 24 hours after the invitations were received at other
diplomatic missions in Kabul. Such invitations are usually sent out
about two weeks in advance.
   The appointment of a new Soviet ambassador comes at a time when
both Moscow and the Soviet-style government in Kabul have been
stepping up diplomatic pressure to end the civil war.
   Under an accord signed in Geneva on April 14, the Soviet Union
is to complete the pullout of its troops from Afghanistan by next
Feb. 15. The withdrawal started May 15 and is now at the halfway
point, with an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 Soviet soldiers remaining.
   Soviet forces intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979.
   Meanwhile in Peshawar, Pakistan, seven Afghan army defectors
criticized the Afghan military Thursday as weak and incapable of
surviving without Soviet support.
   The seven surrendered to Moslem guerrillas earlier this month
during a siege of the northeastern garrison town of Asmar in the
border province of Kunar. Asmar is now in the hands of the Moslem
guerrillas, called mujahedeen.
   Heavy fighting in the Kunar Valley in recent weeks has routed
Afghan army troops from several heavily fortified garrisons. On
Monday, the provincial capital of Asadabad fell to the rebels.
   Noor Ahmad Nasrat, corps commander of the 9th division of the
Afghan army said, ``The majority of the military support the
mujahedeen but because of pressure can't come over to them.''
   Nasrat, the highest ranking defector and self-appointed
spokesman, said anti-personnel mines surround government garrisons
to keep the government soldiers from leaving.

   Anna Sandhu Ray, who 10 years ago
Thursday wed the man convicted of killing the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr., said on her anniversary that she plans to divorce James
Earl Ray.
   ``I have told him that I was going to take measures to get a
divorce and he agreed that that might be the best thing for me to
do,'' Mrs. Ray said of her imprisoned husband. She said she plans
to divorce him on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.
   Mrs. Ray, 42, said she decided to divorce Ray after he told her
she was being ``cut out'' of any participation in or profits from a
book Ray is writing, in which he contends that the FBI conspired to
kill King.
   Mrs. Ray, who lives 20 miles north of Nashville in the town of
White House, said she has talked to a lawyer, Harold H. Cole, about
formal divorce proceedings. Cole said Thursday no firm steps toward
a divorce have been taken.
   Ray, 60, was sentenced to 99 years in prison in 1969 when he
pleaded guilty to shooting and killing King as the civil rights
leader stood on a balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis.
   Ray, now in Brushy Mountain State Prison in east Tennessee, has
since repeatedly denied his guilt and sought a new trial.
   Mrs. Ray has said she believes the killing was instigated by the
Soviet government.
   Mrs. Ray met Ray in December 1977, while she worked as a
free-lance courtroom artist. She married him Oct. 13, 1978,
``because I wanted to help him.''
   She said Thursday that she has not seen her husband for about
two years, although they have exchanged letters.
   Mrs. Ray said the actual divorce filing will be made after she
is able to ``find out information about the book.''

   The manager of the troubled Savannah River
Plant has taken a leave of absence for medical reasons pending his
retirement, according to the Du Pont Co., which operates the
nuclear complex.
   Du Pont spokesman Jim Felder said there was no connection
between the departure of SRP general manager John T. Granaghan, 59,
and problems with the plant's reactors.
   Granaghan's leave of absence, pending his retirement after 38
years with Du Pont, was due to medical reasons, Felder said.
   ``It's a personal matter. Mr. Granaghan had surgery earlier this
year,'' Felder said.
   John T. Lowe, director of the Savannah River Laboratory, will
succeed Granaghan as plant manager, Felder said.
   The plant's three reactors were reduced to half-power late last
year when experts questioned whether the emergency cooling system
could cope with an emergency at full power.
   Since April, all three reactors have been shut down entirely for
maintenance and testing amid additional safety questions.
   When closed, SRP was the sole producer of tritium and plutonium
used by the military in nuclear weapons. The only other
manufacturer, the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington state,
has been shut down for more than a year.
   Westinghouse Electric Co. is scheduled to assume operation of
the plant on April 1.

<HEAD>Troops Kill Palestinian In Arab Village</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israeli troops on Thursday shot and killed one
Palestinian after being pelted by cement blocks and stones when
they entered an Arab village in the occupied West Bank, the army
command said.
   A military spokeswoman said troops opened fire in Judeida, north
of Nablus, after one soldier was wounded by the protesters. Four
Palestinians were wounded in the clash.
   ``Because it was a life-threatening situation, the troops opened
fire,'' the spokeswoman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``One of the attackers was killed.''
   The army identified the Palestinian as Mahmoud Ahmed Abu Khatir,
18. His death raised the Arab death toll to 296 since the
Palestinian uprising broke out 10 months ago in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Six Israelis have died in the unrest during the same
period.
   Three Palestinians were wounded in the Gaza Strip, including a
10-year-old boy shot in the chest, Israel radio and Arab hospital
officials said. The army said two Palestinians were wounded.
   In Jerusalem, a bus driver was slightly injured when his bus was
stoned as it drove along the main street of Arab east Jerusalem,
police spokesman Rafi Levy said.
   Meanwhile, doctors and nurses immunized 20,000 students against
polio in the first day of a campaign to vaccinate all 650,000
Palestinian inhabitants of the Gaza Strip. The government launched
the campaign following a polio outbreak inside Israel. At least 12
polio cases have been confirmed.
   In politics, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of the left-leaning
Labor Party and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing
Likud bloc agreed to an Oct. 23 television debate before the Nov. 1
national elections. The top campaign issue is the Palestinian
uprising.
   U.S.-born Rabbi Meir Kahane, an anti-Arab member of parliament
who was barred last week from running in the elections because of
his racist views, appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn the
parliament decision disqualifying him.
   He said his policy favoring the expulsion of all Arabs from
Israel is rooted in Orthodox Jewish law, not racism.
   ``I am not a Nazi. I am not a racist. I am an Orthodox Jew,''
Kahane said.
   Meanwhile in Abu Dhabi, a PLO official said in an interview
published Thursday that the Palestine National Council will meet
Oct. 31 to discuss measures to declare an independent Palestinian
state.
   Yassir Abd-Rabbo, head of the PLO's information department, told
the United Arab Emirates newspaper Al-Ittihad the PLO leadership
would discuss the future of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, where 1.5 million Palestinians live.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Thursday lost its long and costly
battle to block British newspapers from publishing extracts from
``Spycatcher,'' the memoirs of former intelligence agent Peter
Wright.
   Hours later, British Broadcasting Corp. TV altered its schedule
to air an April interview with Wright in which he said part of his
book was ``unreliable.''
   He was refering to a passage dealing with an alleged plot inside
Britain's MI5 counter-intelligence agency to force the resignation
of Labor Party Prime Minister Harold Wilson in the 1970s.
   Conservative Party spokesman Michael Mates said Wright's comment
made ``nonsense'' of media claims of the public's right to know.
   ``The public doesn't have a right or need to know about fanciful
ideas which somebody ... chooses to put in a book and call it
revelations of wrongdoing.''
   Newspapers saw the ruling by the Law Lords, Britain's highest
court, as a triumph for press freedom, while the government claimed
a moral victory because the five judges unanimously accused Wright
of violating the oath of secrecy he took as an intelligence officer.
   He was ``guilty of treachery as heinous as that of the spies he
excoriates in his book,'' said Lord Keith, one of the judges.
   But the judges said any possible damage to Britain's national
security had already been caused by the book's publication
elsewhere, and they lifted temporary injunctions against The
Guardian, The Observer and The Sunday Times of London.
   ``It is absolutely terrific,'' Peter Preston, editor of The
Guardian, said after the ruling. ``This has gone on for 2{ years
and been heard by 23 judges. It is smashing to win hands down at
the end.''
   Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times, said: ``We won, but
it's a battle we should never have had to fight.''
   The book has sold 1.4 million copies overseas after being
published in 40 countries, including the United States.
   ``Spycatcher'' alleges that MI5 eavesdropped on foreign
embassies, bungled operations, stole documents, plotted to
assassinate Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and plotted to
destabilize the Labor Party government in the 1970s.
   Wright also claims the late MI5 chief Sir Roger Hollis was a
Soviet agent _ a claim the government says has never been
substantiated by investigators.
   On the BBC broadcast Thursday night, Wright indicated the
alleged Wilson plot was not as advanced as the book suggested and
that the manner of forcing the resignation was not exactly as
published.
   Asked if that part of the book was ``perhaps an exaggeration of
what you recall now,'' Wright answered: ``I would say it was
unreliable.''
   Asked if it would be ``fair to conclude from that, that the plot
_ if that's what it was _ was not as advanced as the book
suggests,'' Wright responded: ``I think that is true.''
   He indicated his ghostwriter, Paul Greengrass, might have
misunderstood him, but when the BBC showed him proofs he had edited
without changing the statements in question he said:
   ``I think basically I never thought there would be a fuss about
it. I didn't see why there would be a fuss about it because it had
been stopped.''
   The BBC said Wright, who was 72 at the time of the interview and
had suffered a stroke, appeared a bit confused over details.
   After the ruling, publishers William Heinemann said they would
give the government two weeks' notice that they plan to print
200,000 paperback copies in Britain.
   But early editions of Friday's Daily Telegraph quoted Heinemann
spokeswoman Helen Fraser as saying that after studying the decision
with company lawyers, ``we do not think this would be possible.''
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said the ruling vindicated the
government's three-year international battle to block
``Spycatcher,'' and uphold the duty of confidentiality which bars
intelligence agents from writing books and memoirs about their work.
   Wright, 73, retired to Australia in 1976 to raise thoroughbred
horses following a 20-year career with MI5.
   Lord Brightman said Wright had ``flagrantly'' breached his
secrecy oath and Lord Jauncey said ``his action reeked of
turpitude.''
   Wright could not be reached for comment Thursday. His lawyer
Malcolm Turnbull welcomed the decision, but said the judges'
comments about Wright's conduct ``lacked objectivity and were
inappropriate.''
   Wright has said nothing in his book could jeopardize national
security, but Lord Griffiths said it wasn't for Wright to decide.
   ``What may appear to the writer to be trivial may in fact be the
one missing piece in the jigsaw sought by some hostile intelligence
agency,'' he wrote.
   Donald Trelford, editor of The Observer, estimated the
government would have to pay $3.5 million in legal fees. The
government puts the bill at $1 million.
   The government first moved against the book in September 1985
when it obtained a temporary injunction preventing publication in
Australia.
   That case was resolved only in June when Australia's highest
court unanimously ruled against Britain. While accepting that
Wright was bound by secrecy, the judges said Australian courts had
no jurisdiction to enforce British security regulations.
   The Hong Kong Court of Appeal upheld the British government's
case, but the New Zealand High Court rejected it.
   Last year the government said individuals could bring copies of
``Spycatcher'' into Britain, and Heinemann estimates 50,000
hardbacks and 70,000 paperbacks arrived that way, mostly from the
United States and Ireland.

   The Senate passed emergency legislation
Thurday ordering the Federal Aviation Administration to resolve an
``air traffic control crisis'' at Chicago's O'Hare International
Airport.
   The resolution approved without objection instructed the federal
agency to report to Congress by Oct. 25 on its plans to reduce
pressure on controllers and alleviate flight delays at the nation's
busiest airport.
   The FAA said it already has 80 recommendations to improve
operations at O'Hare, including a pay increase for tower staff as
an incentive to attract and keep experienced controllers at the
facility.
   David Carle, an aide to Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said the
federal Office of Personnel Management approved the 20 percent pay
incentive on Wednesday. However, OPM said Thursday that the
proposal remains under review.
   Action is expected by OPM within days on the bonuses, which most
likely would apply to hard-to-staff control towers in New York, Los
Angeles and Atlanta as well as Chicago, Transportation Secretary
James Burnley said late Thursday.
   FAA spokesman Bob Buckhorn added that no decision has been
reached yet on the percentage bonus to be offered to the
controllers.
   The FAA said O'Hare controllers have had 30 flight-handling
errors so far this year, compared with 12 mistakes during all of
1987 and far surpassing the previous record of 22 errors in 1986.
   ``I find that record appalling,'' said Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill.,
one of the measure's sponsors. ``It is simply indefensible.''
   Dixon said the fult lies with the FAA for its failure to ease
the workload on controllers handling flights to and from O'Hare and
other Chicago-area facilities, including Midway Airport and Meigs
Field.
   Responding to the increase in mistakes, the FAA imposed
restrictions Oct. 4 limiting the number of takeoffs and landings at
O'Hare during peak periods. Instead of improving conditions,
lawmakers said, the limitation has caused more than 100 flight
delays at the airport each day.
   Dixon joined Simon and Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., in
introducing the resolution, which orders the FAA to propose both
immediate and long-term solutions to the problem of controller
errors at O'Hare.
   Although Congress will not be in session, Simon said
subcommittee members would review the report and expect the agency
to implement any measures not requiring a vote in the House or
Senate.
   ``We know what the problems are at O'Hare. The FAA knows what
the problems are,'' Simon said. ``I have assured FAA I will work
with my colleague ... in instances where congressional action may
be needed.''
   The resolution also instructs the FAA to establish a timetable
for increasing the number of journeyman controllers at O'Hare.
Agency standards call for 72 full-performance-level controllers at
the O'Hare tower, and Simon said only 32 are fully qualified now.
   The resolution would not have the force of law, but Simon said a
meeting Tuesday with FAA officials left him confident the agency
would comply.
   ``This is a problem that has been smouldering for years, and it
won't be completely solved overnight,'' he said. ``But we now seem
to have FAA's attention and their willingness to cooperate.''
   Meanwhile, the FAA announced several steps Thursday aimed at
increasing the radar and control tower staffs at O'Hare.
   The agency said it is turning over training responsibilities to
an outside contractor, freeing five fully qualified controllers to
handle traffic. It also said that nine full-performance controllers
who once worked at O'Hare have agreed to return to duty there
within the next 30 days.
   In addition, the FAA said two additional controller positions
will be created by mid-January to help handle incoming aircraft at
O'Hare.

   A federal judge issued arrest

   Judge Rafael Pena signed the warrants at the request of the
attorney general's office, said the assistant, Jorge Lozano.
   Carlos Lazo of the Attorney General's Human Rights Department
said the judge had been asked to issue the warrants for four
soldiers of the Jiboa Battalion alleged to have been involved in
the Sept. 21 massacre.
   According to residents of San Francisco, 30 miles east of San
Salvador, battalion soliders used grenades and gunfire to kill
seven men and three women from the village who were suspected of
collaborating with leftist guerrillas.
   The army at first said the 10 dead were part of a guerrilla
column ambushed by troops. After testimony of relatives and
neighbors became public, the military changed its version to say
eight peasants were killed in an ambush by guerrillas and troops
killed two of the ambushers.
   Lazo said that according to villagers, up to eight soldiers were
involved in the slayings. While more arrest warrants could be
requested, Lazo said no officer had been implicated to date.
   ``We have asked the judge to order the arrest of four people,
all soldiers in the Jiboa Battalion,'' Lazo said. ``Sufficient
evidence exists to justify their detention _ the testimony of the
relatives, the neighbors.''
   The Jiboa Battalion is part of the 5th Infantry Brigade based in
nearby San Vicente. Brigade commander Col. Jesus Chavez Caceres on
Thursday sent Pena a list of soldiers who Chavez said were
operating in San Francisco on Sept. 21.
   Chavez's list, which Lozano showed reporters in the judge's
office in San Sebastian, had the names of 33 men. Only one of the
four names appearing on the arrest warrants _ Hernan Ayala _ was on
the list, which did not identify the soldiers' ranks. San Sebastian
is 21 miles east of San Salvador.
   Lozano said Pena would ask Chavez for an expanded list to
include ranks. He said the arrest warrants would be delivered to
Chavez.
   Attempts to contact Chavez at 5th Brigade headquarters were
unsuccessful.
   In comments broadcast Wednesday by local television, Chavez
insisted the peasants died in a guerrilla ambush.
   Nine of the 10 bodies were exhumed last week. Roberto Maldonado,
a court-appointed forensic doctor, told journalists seven of the
nine bodies had powder burns indicating they had been shot from a
distance of about six inches.
   The slayings represented the first massacre of such magnitude
attributed to government forces in four years. Human rights groups
also have expressed concern over a rise in killings by right-wing
death squads.
   A recent report by Americas Watch, a New York-based private
organization that monitors human rights, noted two weeks ago that
no Salvadoran officer or death squad member has been prosecuted and
punished for a human rights violation.
   The U.S. State Department, through the embassy, has put
considerable pressure on government and military authorities to
investigate the slayings and prosecute those responsible,
diplomatic sources say.
   The 9-year civil war pitting leftist guerrillas against
government forces has killed an estimated 65,000 people, most of
them civilians.

   Amnesty International on Thursday urged President
Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria to begin an inquiry into the fatal
shootings of unarmed civilian demonstrators.
   The London-based human rights organization said the number of
people killed during the clashes was much higher than the 176
officially listed.
   In Paris, exiled Algerian opposition leader Ahmed Ben Bella
estimated 1,000 people died. Ben Bella, first president of
independent Algeria, was ousted in a 1965 coup.
   The uprising began Oct. 4 when youthful rioters burned cars,
smashed shops and attacked government buildings to protest the
rising cost of living, government austerity measures and consumer
goods shortages.
   The number of protesters swelled and Bendjedid declared a state
of emergency to bring the streets under virtual martial law. He
withdrew most of the troops Thursday, bringing temporary calm to
the capital, and promised a referendum on political reform to give
Algeria's parliament greater power.
   Amnesty said it received reports that hundreds of suspected
critics or opponents of the government had been detained as a
result of the protests.
   Miloud Brahimi, president of Algeria's Human Rights League, has
put the figure at 3,000.
   An undetermined number have been tortured, Amnesty said, and
others summarily tried without legal counsel and sentenced to
prison terms.
   Reports reaching Amnesty said screams could be heard coming from
the national police academy in Al-Biar where many detainees are
believed held.

   Cancellor Helmut Kohl urged West Europe on
Thursday to assume more responsiblity for its defense and proposed
that a ``European army'' be created in the future.
   ``We cannot wait for our American friends to pressure even more
strongly than they have to assume a fair burden-sharing,'' Kohl
said in a speech in West Berlin. He was referring to frequent
complaints by U.S. officials that too much of the burden of
protecting West Europe falls on the U.S. military.
   Kohl said, ``The achievement of a European concept in security
policies ... with the goal of achieving a common European defense
in close partnership with the United States ... is among our most
important duty for the future.''
   Signs are emerging that this is already happening, he said,
pointing to a West German-French agreement to form a joint defense
brigade. But he said more needs to be done.
   ``We must get going with the step-by-step realization of a
common European defense _ and if possible, even if it doesn't come
until the end of this path, a European army.''
   Kohl also said he favors creation of a ``European federal
police'' to combat terrorism and drug crimes.
   Kohl was addressing a West Berlin conference of the Aspen
Institute, an American think tank.

   Here is the text of Thursday's presidential
debate between Republican Vice President George Bush and Democrat
Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.
   Q: Good evening. On behalf of the Commission on Presidential
Debates I am pleased to welcome you to the second presidential
debate. I am Bernard Shaw of CNN, Cable News Network. My colleagues
on the panel are: Anne Compton of ABC News; Margaret Warner of
Newsweek Magazine; and Andrea Mitchell of NBC News. The candidates
are: Vice President George Bush, the Republican nominee; and
Governor Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee.
   For the next 90 minutes we will be questioning the candidates
following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of the
two campaigns. However, there are no restrictions on the questions
that my colleagues and I can ask this evening, and the candidates
have no prior knowledge of our questions. By agreement between the
candidates, the first question goes to Governor Dukakis. You have
two minutes to respond. Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and
murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the
killer?
   Dukakis: No, I don't, Bernard, and I think you know that I've
opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don't see any
evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better and
more effective ways to deal with violent crime. We've done so in my
own state, and it's one of the reasons why we have had the biggest
drop in crime of any industrial state in America, why we have the
lowest murder rate of any industrial state in America.
   But we have work to do in this nation; we have work to do to
fight a real war and not a phony war against drugs. And that's
something that I want to lead, something we haven't had over the
course of the past many years, even though the vice president has
been, at least allegedly, in charge of that war. We have much to do
to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement
agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors
in this hemisphere. And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as
soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight that war.
   But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at
home. And that's one of the things that I hope I can lead
personally as the president of the United States. We've had great
success in my own state, and we've reached out to young people and
their families and been able to help them by beginning drug
education and prevention in the early elementary grades.
   So we can fight this war and we can win this war, and we can do
so in a way that marshals our forces, that provides real support
for state and local law enforcement officers who have not been
getting that kind of support, do it in a way which will bring down
violence in this nation, will help our youngsters to stay away from
drugs, will stop this avalanche of drugs that's pouring into the
country, and will make it possible for our kids and our families to
grow up in safe and secure and decent neighborhoods.
   Q: Mr. Vice President, your one-minute rebuttal.
   Bush: Well, a lot of what this campaign is about, it seems to
me, Bernie, is to a question of values. And here, I do have, on
this particular question, a big difference with my opponent.
   You see, I do believe that some crimes are so heinous, so
brutal, so outrageous _ and I'd say particularly those that result
in the death of a police officer _ those real brutal crimes, I do
believe in the death penalty. And I think it is a deterrent. And I
believe we need it, and I'm glad that the Congress moved on this
drug bill, and it finally called for that, related to these
narcotics drug kingpins. And so, we just have an honest difference
of opinion. I support it, and he doesn't.

   A scientist involved in research based on
Nazi experiments that deliberately froze to death concentration
camp prisoners has resigned from the University of Minnesota.
   Dr. Robert Pozos said Thursday that he plans to continue the
hypothermia studies at his new post at the University of
Washington. He said his resignation was not prompted by the
criticism surrounding the research.
   ``I'm just changing where I'm doing my research. The work will
continue,'' said Pozos, 45, director of the hypothermia research
laboratory at the University of Minnesota, Duluth.
   Pozos, whose resignation takes effect Oct. 25, said he will
become vice president of minority affairs at the University of
Washington. He also will teach as a professor of physiology and
biophysics at the Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.
   ``Seattle is a very nice part of the world to live in ... but
I'm going to regret leaving northeastern Minnesota,'' said Pozos,
who's been at the University of Minnesota for 18 years.
   Earlier this year, Pozos sparked debate over how science should
approach data obtained during the Holocaust. He said he planned to
use Nazi studies of World War II concentration camp prisoners
imprisoned at Dachau.
   The plan was criticized by some scientists and Jewish leaders,
but some medical ethicists contend the study of Nazi research could
save lives.
   Pozos and Dr. Arthur Caplan, a University of Minnesota medical
ethicist, plan to address a conference in Minneapolis next May on
the ethical questions raised by using the Nazi studies, Pozos said.
   ``Caplan and I are using what happened in Nazi Germany more so
as a model to discuss and to show what can happen with a society
when it feels that it needs to get data to protect itself,'' Pozos
said.
   ``We're not saying it's good or bad. This is what happened,'' he
added.
   Earlier this year, Pozos said he plans to analyze and republish
a little-known World War II text, ``The Treatment of Shock from
Prolonged Exposure to Cold.''
   The study, conducted by doctors at Dachau, includes observations
and physiological measurements of human subjects placed in vats of
freezing liquid, often to the point of death, according to those
familiar with the study.
   ``You had some of the world's experts doing research in these
areas,'' Pozos said. ``It doesn't make them correct in terms of
ethics.''
   Pozos will continue to consult the University of Minnesota,
Duluth on research projects he helped start. Those projects came
from $1 million in grants from government and corporate sources.

   Moderator: Now, to you, Vice President Bush. I quote to you this
from Article III of the 20th Amendment of the Constitution: Quote,
``If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the
president, the president-elect shall have died, the Vice
President-elect shall become President,'' meaning, if you are
elected and die
   before Inauguration Day --
   Bush: Bernie! (Laughtr)
   Moderator: -- automatically -- automatically, Dan Quayle would
become the 41st president of the United States. What have you to
say about that possibility?
   Bush: I'd have confidence in him, and I made a good selection.
And I've never seen such a pounding, an unfair pounding, on a young
senator in my entire life. And I've never seen a presidential
campaign where the presidential nominee runs against my vice
presidential nominee -- never seen one before. You know, Lloyd
Bentsen jumped on Dan Quayle when Dan Quayle said he's had roughly
the same amount of experience. He had two terms in the Congress; he
had two terms in the Senate, serving his second term.
   He founded the -- authored the Job Training Partnership Act that
says to American working men and women that are thrown out of work
for no fault of their own, that they're going to have jobs. We're
moving into a new, competitive age, and we need that kind of thing.
He, unlike my opponent, is an expert in national defense, helped
amend the INF Treaty, so we got a good, sound treaty when these
people over here were talking about a freeze. If we'd listened to
them, we would never have had a treaty.
   And, so, I have great confidence in him and he's -- it's turning
around. You know, the American people are fair. They don't like it
when there's an unfair pounding and kind of hooting about people.
They want to judge it on the record itself. And, so, I'm proud of
my choice. And, you know, I don't think age is the only criterion.
But, I'll tell you something, I'm proud that people that are 30
years old and 40 years old now have someone in their generation
that is going to be vice president of the United States of America.
I made a good selection. The American people are seeing it and I'm
proud of it. That's what I'd say. And he could do the job.
   Moderator: Governor Dukakis, your one minute rebuttal.
   Dukakis: Bernard, this was the first presidential decision that
we, as nominees, were called upon to make and that's why people are
so concerned because it was an opportunity for us to demonstrate
what we were looking for in a running mate. More than that, it was
the first national security decision that we had to make.
   The vice president talks about national security. Three times
since World War II, the vice president has had to suddenly become
the president and commander-in-chief. I picked Lloyd Bentsen
because I thought he was the best qualified person for the job. Mr.
Bush picked Dan Quayle and, before he did it, he said, ``Watch my
choice for vice president. It will tell all.'' And it sure did. It
sure did.

<HEAD>Report Says Prison Furloughs Widespread, Successful</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By J.L. SCHMIDT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The use of furloughs for prisoners in the
United States is widespread, successful and marred by few problems,
according to an independent journal for corrections professionals.
   The issue of furloughs for prisoners serving life sentences has
been debated in the presidential campaign, with charges by Vice
President George Bush that Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis'
state program was the most liberal in the nation.
   But Marj Marlette, editor of Corrections Compendium, said a
survey done for the journal didn't support Bush's claim.
   ``Our survey didn't indicate that the Massachusetts program was
that much different from those in the two-thirds of the state
corrections systems which allow furloughs for lifers,'' she said.
   The survey was done by Contact Center, Inc., a Lincoln-based
non-profit information referral service for criminal justice and
human services. It showed showed that all states, the Federal
Bureau of Prisons and the District of Columbia have some form of
furlough or temporary release program.
   Thirty-six states, the federal system and that in the District
of Columbia allow furloughs for lifers. In 1987 at least two states
allowed prisoners sentenced to life without parole to become
eligible for furlough, the survey said.
   Bush has cited the case of Willie Horton Jr., a convicted
murderer who brutally slashed a Maryland man and twice raped his
fiancee last year after escaping in 1986 while on a Massachusetts
furlough.
   Massachusetts no longer allows furloughs for prisoners convicted
of first degree murder and serving life without parole.
   In 1987, Massachusetts granted 5,857 furloughs, and all but
three were completed without incident under the terms of the
furloughs, according to information provided for the survey. The
three unsuccessful furloughs involved rule violations such as being
involved in alcohol or drugs, she said.
   Last year, Massachusetts granted furloughs to 1,373 lifers and
all of them were completed successfully, according to the survey.
   Twenty-two states reported no problems or few problems with the
program. Eleven states reported that some furloughs were
unsuccessful because inmates committed of another crime while on
furlough.
   ``Most often those were escapes, but we don't have a breakdown
on how many of those involved lifers escaping in each state. As I
said before, the problems were mostly with late returns, drugs or
alcohol or some other rule violations. None involved violent
crimes,'' she said.
   An estimated 200,000 furloughs were granted in 1987, with more
than 53,000 inmates involved. Nearly half of the prison systems
reported that their furloughs were 98 percent successful.
Mississippi, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and
Washington reported 100 percent success. All but three states _
Hawaii, Oregon and North Carolina _ had success rates over 90
percent, Marlette said.
   ``Virtually every system considered furloughs helpful in
preparing inmates for release and improving institutional morale,''
she said.
   According to responses from all U.S. prison systems, the federal
system and the District of Columbia, furloughs were most often
granted to help inmates maintain family ties, look for work and
housing prior to parole, and for general reintegration in the
community.
   They also were given for medical care, shopping, recreation and
religious or treatment programs.
   The lengths of the furloughs ranged from four to 12 hours
(during daylight hours) in Florida to up to 210 days in Oregon.
Most were for shorter periods, ``although we didn't run an average
time,'' Marlette said.

   Two smiling and ostensibly upbeat candidates,
George Bush and Michael Dukakis, shook hands amiably Thursday night
to begin their second and final debate of the presidential campaign.
   Both men had been coached by advisers to project a personable
and humane image, and acknowledged with a wave and a pointed finger
the audience as applause greeted their arrival at UCLA's Pauley
Pavilion.
   But their expressions quickly turned serious at the first
question to Dukakis, about whether he would favor the death penalty
for the killer if his wife, Kitty, were raped and murdered.
   Both men punctuated their answers with expansive gestures,
Dukakis seeming to use less of the familiar closed-fist,
thumb-jabbing movement that has become his trademark.
   Dukakis looked directly into the camera, but Bush _ contrary to
advice given him by former Sen. John Tower of Texas to do the same
in order to establish a connection with the TV viewing audience _
instead faced mostly the panelists or his opponent while answering.
   Dukakis appeared eager to counter his image as a somber,
non-humorous candidate, smiling as he said, ``I think the
presidency of the United States is a very serious office'' but
adding that he wants to be liked and would handle the job ``with as
much good humor as I can.''
   Bush also smiled often and looked bemused when asked a question
about the possibility of his running-mate, Dan Quayle, becoming
president should Bush be elected and die before Inauguration Day.
But Bush then gave a serious answer, reiterating his confidence in
the Indiana senator.
   The debate stage, telegenic blue backdrop, red carpeting and oak
lecterns installed in the pavilion were the ones the two candidates
used at their first debate in Winston-Salem, N.C., last month.
   The props were trucked to Los Angeles from Omaha, Neb., where
they also had been put to use for last week's debate between vice
presidential rivals Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen.
   The lectern Bush stood behind was set at 48 inches, while the
one for the half-foot shorter Dukakis was at 45 inches.
   In the carpeting around Dukakis' lectern was a circular cut from
where it was altered to insert a subtle three-inch riser the
Massachusetts governor used in Winston-Salem.
   Dukakis wore a dark grey suit with a red tie and Bush wore a
dark blue suit with a red, white and blue striped tie.
   The audience was restrained, having been lectured severely
against outbursts and applause, but did reward each candidate with
those responses on occasion.
   The well-dressed audience was dotted with California elected
officials and some members of the Hollywood community, including
actress Sally Field.
   Bush said Wednesday he wanted to show voters ``what my heartbeat
is, what I really care about.''
   It took work at UCLA to create a setting that might foster those
kinds of personal self revelations.
   The venue at UCLA was vastly different from the cozy Wake Forest
University chapel where they met in North Carolina.
   The chapel could accommodate fewer than 1,500 spectators once a
balcony was outfitted for TV crews and reporters. Pauley Pavilion
seats 13,000 and had to be revamped for a more intimate audience of
2,000.
   The stage and seats were set up on the basketball floor, which
was partitioned off from the bleachers.
   The audience was divided between Dukakis and Bush supporters and
guests invited by the sponsoring Commission on Presidential Debates.
   Of the 2,000 tickets for the debate, only about 100 were
distributed through the university, said Alan Charles, vice
chancellor for UCLA.
   Those tickets came from the one-third allotted to the debate
commission. The campaigns also got one-third each.
   Pauley Pavilion, home of the UCLA Bruins basketball team, is in
a central location on the sprawling campus where 34,000
undergraduate and graduate students attend classes.
   At lunchtime Thursday, a punk rock band named Thelonius Monster
entertained a few hundred students who gathered in the busy plaza
between the student union building and arena.
   With Dukakis-Bentsen placards on the stage, the band leader
repeatedly derided Bush. The students laughed but seemed more
enthusiastic about the band's hard-driving music than the political
commentary.
   UCLA audio engineer Fred Stites said the concert was part of the
campus' noon music series and not sponsored by the Dukakis campaign.

   Moderator: Anne Compton for the vice president.
   Q: Thank you, Bernie. Mr. Vice President, yes, we read your
lips: ``No new taxes.'' But, despite that same pledge from
President Reagan, after income tax rates were cut, in each of the
last five years, some federal taxes have gone up -- on social
security, cigarettes, liquor, even long-distance telephone calls.
Now that's money straight out of people's wallets. Isn't the phrase
``no new taxes'' misleading the voters?
   Bush: No, because that's -- that I'm pledged to that. And, yes,
some taxes have gone up. And the main point is taxes have been cut
and yet income is up to the federal government by 25 percent in the
last three years. And so, what I want to do is keep this expansion
going. I don't want to kill it off by at tax increase.
   More Americans at work today than at any time in the history of
this country and a greater percentage of the work force. And the
way you kill expansions is to raise taxes. And I don't want to do
that. And I won't do that. And what I have proposed is something
much better. And it's going to take discipline of the executive
branch. It's going to take discipline of the congressional branch
-- and that is what I call a flexible freeze that allows growth --
about 4 percent or the rate of inflation -- but does not permit the
Congress just to add on spending.
   I hear this talk about a blank check _ the . American people are
pretty smart. They know who writes out the checks. And they know
who appropriates the money. It is the United States Congress and by
two to one, Congress is blamed for these deficits. And the answer
is to discipline both the executive branch and the congressional
branch by holding the line on taxes.
   So I am pledged to do that. And those pessimists who say it
can't be done, I'm sorry. I just have a fundamental disagreement
with them.
   Moderator: Gov. Dukakis, your 1 minute response.
   Dukakis: Anne, the vice president made that pledge; he's broken
it three times in the past year already, so it isn't worth the
paper it's printed on. And what I'm concerned about is that if we
continue with the policies that Mr. Bush is talking about here this
evening -- flexible freeze -- somebody described it the other day
as a kind of economic Slurpee.
   He wants to spend billions on virtually every weapons system
around. He says he's not going to raise taxes, though he has broken
that pledge repeatedly. He says he wants to give the wealthiest 1
percent in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break, and
we're going to pay for it. And he's been proposing all kinds of
programs for new spending costing billions.
   Now, if we continue with these policies, this trillion and a
half dollars worth of new debt that's already been added on the
backs of the American taxpayers is going to increase even more. If
we continue with this for another four years, then I'm worried
about the next generation, whether we can ever turn this situation
around.
   No, we need a chief executive who's prepared to lead, who won't
blame the Congress, but will lead, will bring down that deficit,
will make tough choices on spending, will go out and do the job
that we expect of him and do with with the Congress of the United
States.

<HEAD>African National Congress Blames Security Forces For Arson Attacks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   The African National Congress
on Thursday blamed security forces for an arson attack on a Roman
Catholic Church building in Pretoria.
   The outlawed ANC said in a statement sent by Telex from Zambia
that limpet mines and hand grenades found at the offices of the
Southern African Bishops Conference, damaged in Wednesday's fire,
came from the stocks of the police or army.
   Police said investigators were trying to determine the origin of
the arms.
   ``It does not matter from which quarter such callous deeds stem,
I want to give the assurance that the South African Police will
fight arson, terrorism and violence with all the means available to
it,'' Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok said Thursday night.
   Police said two mines, two grenades and five ammunition
magazines for Soviet-made AK-47 rifles were found after the
pre-dawn fire.
   Jude Pieterse, a spokesman for the bishops, blamed the arsonists
for planting the weapons.
   ``There is no doubt that the objects of destruction ... were
left in the building by the same persons who entered to destroy
it,'' Pieterse said.
   He said police investigators did not ask any questions about the
explosives when speaking to church officials and workers.
   ``We believe the reason for this omission is that the policemen
... assumed the explosives had been left by the saboteurs,''
Pieterse said.
   No one was injured in the fire. Four people, including a nun,
were rescued from a balcony where they were trapped by flames.
   Police said a minibus with false license plates was seen outside
the building shortly before the fire started.
   It was the second attack in six weeks on offices of an
anti-apartheid church organization. A bomb wrecked the headquarters
of the South African Council of Churches in Johannesburg on Aug. 31.
   The ANC said the attacks on church groups ``reaffirm the immoral
and criminal nature of the apartheid regime, which falsely claims
to be Christian.''
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.
   Elsewhere, three black men were injured when a limpet mine
exploded outside a post office in Nigel, about 30 miles southeast
of Johannesburg, police said. Damage was minor, police added.
   Police headquarters said six policemen were wounded by gunfire
late Wednesday in Kathlehong, a black township east of Johannesburg.
   The officers were hospitalized but were not seriously hurt,
police said.
   No arrests were made. Police said cartridges found at the scene
indicated the attackers used AK-47 rifles, a standard weapon for
ANC guerrillas.

<HEAD>`Saved from Obscurity,' A New Play, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An actor's life is not easy, but it certainly
can be funny as Tom Mardirosian demonstrates in ``Saved From
Obscurity,'' his semi-autobiographical play that opened Thursday at
off-Broadway's Playwrights Horizons.
   Mardirosian is a genial, balding, nondescript man, one of those
talented journeyman actors no one quite remembers when the house
lights come up. Audiences occasionally see them in plays, both on
and off-Broadway, in television soap operas and, if they don't
blink, in major motion pictures. Make no mistake, they'll remember
Mardirosian after this.
   He has put together a winning and ultimately joyous theatrical
resume that celebrates his particular life in the theater. For 90
minutes, the actor talks about his career and what lured a fat
Greek-Armenian kid from Buffalo, N.Y., to the stage.
   Was it his thwarted debut as the Sheriff of Nottingham in the
fourth grade when his mother made him stay home from school because
he was sick? His understudy _ a girl yet _ went on to receive all
the glory.
   Or was it beause of the funny faces he could make and get his
friends, a tough Italian crowd, to laugh out loud? Or his
professional stage debut at Buffalo's Studio Arena in a bit role he
got only because he could do a French accent?
   Mardirosian tells his story more or less chronologically. With
fine support from Peter Appel, Frederica Meister and Hansford Rowe,
he highlights his work as an actor in New York and on the West
Coast.
   The play has special appeal for theater buffs or insiders, those
audiences who actually have seen some of his quick flops, such as
``Cliffhanger'' off-Broadway or ``Happy End'' on Broadway.
   A high point of the evening is his explanation of his role in
``The Normal Heart,'' Larry Kramer's long-running AIDS play in
which the actor played several small parts. Among these was a
doctor who sat silently on stage while being harangued by a fellow
physician. During the play's run, Mardirosian became bored in the
role and began making up silent retorts to the accusations thrown
at him.
   The actor devotes a long segment to his association with ``Cuba
and His Teddy Bear,'' the Broadway play starring Robert De Niro and
Burt Young. Mardirosian understudied both stars and finally went on
one night for an absent Young.
   He takes the audience through his preparation to sub for the
actor, describing the terror and exhilaration of jumping into a
play that is already running, and working with actors who are used
to performing with someone else. It's a fascinating story, one that
goes a long way toward explaining Mardirosian's enthusiasm for
acting.
   ``Saved From Obscurity'' _ the title refers to what the Academy
Award did for the career of F. Murray Abraham _ is the best kind of
theater memoir. It's an inside story told by a pro with affection
and just enough jaundice to make it all the more entertaining.

   Q: And to Governor Dukakis.
   Q: Governor, let me follow up on that by asking you, you've said
it many times, that you have balanced 10 budgets in a row in
Massachusetts. Are you promising the American people, here tonight,
that within a four-year presidential term, you will balance the
federal budget?
   Dukakis: No, I'm not sure I can promise that. I don't think
either one of us can, really, there's no way of anticipating what
may happen. I will say this, that we'll set as our goal, a steady,
gradual reduction of the deficit which will require tough choices
on spending. It will require a good strong rate of economic growth.
It will require a plan that the president works out with the
Congress _ doesn't blame them, works it out with them _ which
brings that deficit down. It will require us to go out and collect
billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being
paid in this country. And that's grossly unfair to the average
American who's paying his taxes, and paying them on time, and
doesn't have any alternative _ it's taken out of his paycheck.
   Mr. Bush says we're going to put the IRS on every taxpayer.
That's not what we're going to do. I'm for the Taxpayer Bill of
Rights. Well, I think it's unconscionable, Anne, that we should be
talking or thinking about imposing new taxes on average Americans,
when there are billions out there _ over a hundred billion dollars
in taxes owe that aren't being paid.
   Now, I think if we work together on it, and if you have a
president that will work with the Congress and the American people,
we can bring that deficit down steadily, 20, 25, $30 billion a
year, build economic growth, build a good strong future for
America, invest in those things which we must invest in: economic
development, good jobs, good schools for our kids, college
opportunity for young people, decent health care and affordable
housing, and a clean and safe environment. We can do all of those
things, and at the same time build a future in which we're standing
on a good strong fiscal foundation.
   Senator Bentsen said, as you recall at the debate with Senator
Quayle, that ``If you give any of us $200 billion dollars worth of
hot checks a year, we can create an illusion of prosperity.'' But
sooner or later, that credit card mentality isn't going to work.
And I want to bring to the White House, a sense of strength and
fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation
under which this country, or above which this country can move,
grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our
kids and our grand-kids.
   Q: Mr. Vice President? You're one minute response.
   Bush: The governor has to balance a budget in his state. He's
required to by law. He's raised taxes several times. I wish he
would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American
people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government
and for the line-item veto. I'd like to have that line-item veto
for the president, because I think that would be extraordinarily
helpful.
   And I won't do one other thing that he's had to do _ took $29
million out of his state pension fund. That's equivalent in the
federal level of taking out of the Social Security Trust Fund. I'm
not going to do that. I won't do that. And so I'm still a little
unclear as to whether he's for or against a tax increase. I have
been all for the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights all along. And this idea
of unleashing a whole bunch, an army, a conventional force army of
IRS agents into everybody's kitchen _ I mean, he's against most
defense matters, and now he wants to get an army of IRS auditors
going out there. I'm against that. I oppose that. (Applause and
boos)

<HEAD>Turkey Confers With Iranians About Kuridsh Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turkish and Iranian authorities discussed
on Thursday the plight of Kurdish refugees who fled to Turkey
claiming Iraqi forces dropped chemical bombs on their settlements,
a government official reported..
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press the talks took place in the southeastern border
village of Esendere.
   The independent Hurriyet News Agency meanwhile reported that
Iran closed its border with Turkey to prevent any crossings by
Kurdish refugees.
   About 60,000 Kurds sought refuge in Turkey in August, and Iran
offered to accept any of the refugees.
   Nearly 19,000 refugees from Iraq voluntarily went from Turkey to
Iran in recent weeks. But Iran reportedly ran into problems finding
them shelter.
   ``Iran still had the same problem and negotiations centered on
such issues,'' the official said, refusing to go into detail.
   During the Persian Gulf war, Iran supported Kurdish guerrillas
fighting for autonomy in northern Iraq.
   Iraq started an offensive against Kurds soon after Iran agreed
to a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war in August.

<TEXT>
   A Kurdish guerrilla official, a spokesman for the Kurdistan
Democratic Party, or KDP, charged Thursday that Turkey has
``discreetly'' forced as many as 30,000 Kurdish refugees into Iran
in recent days.
   The spokesman, who is known to The Associated Press in Nicosia,
Cyprus, spoke to the AP there by telephone from a West European
city. He spoke on the condition his name and exact location not be
used for ``security reasons.''
   The official called Turkey's treatment of the Kurdish refugees
``despicable'' and appealed for international help.
   ``We are deeply perturbed at Turkey's forcible transportation of
refugees ... without giving the Iranian authorities any prior
notice and without making sure that any arrangements have been made
for them in Iran,'' he said.
   The refugees now were crammed into an overcrowded camp at Zieva
in Iran's northwestern Urumiyeh province, he claimed.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic New Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, said 32,000 Kurdish refugees from Turkey have sought
sanctuary in northwest Iran, including nearly 8,000 in the last few
days, because of Ankara's ``reluctance to host them.''
   The KDP official said: ``Although we are grateful to Turkey for
its initial response in providing refuge for many thousands of
Kurdish civilians fleeing Iraqi onslaughts with chemical weapons,
the Turkish government's behavior in recent weeks has been
despicable.''
   About 20 million Kurds live in the mountainous region where the
borders of Turkey, Iran and Iraq converge. They have been fighting
for independence in all three countries intermittently throughout
this century.

<TEXT>
   Moderator: I'm going to say this, and I'm going to say it once
to every person in this auditorium. What these candidates are about
is of utmost seriousness to the American voters. They should be
heard, and you should be quiet. If you are not quiet, I'm going to
implore the candidates to do something about prodding -- or
quieting their own partisans. But we cannot get through this
program with these outbursts. Margaret Warner, for Governor Dukakis.
   Q: Good evening, Governor, Mr. Vice President. Governor, you won
the first debate on intellect, and yet you lost it on heart.
   Bush:: Just a minute.
   Dukakis: I don't know about the vice --
   Q: You'll get your turn. The American public --
   Dukakis: I don't know whether the vice president agrees with
that.
   Q: The American public admired your performance, but didn't seem
to like you much. Now Ronald Reagan has found his personal warmth
to be a tremendous political asset. Do you think that a president
has to be likable to be an effective leader?
   Dukakis: Margaret, may I go back and just say to the vice
president that I didn't raid the pension fund in Massachusetts.
You're dead wrong, George. We didn't do that. As a matter of fact,
I'm the first governor in the history of my state to fund that
pension system, and I'm very proud of that. And you just had your
   Bush: (Inaudible.)
   Dukakis: -- You just have your information -- no, we did not.
No, we did not. I've been in politics for 25 years, Margaret. I've
won a lot of elections; I've lost a few, as you know, and learned
from those losses. I won the Democratic nomination in 51 separate
contests. I think I'm a reasonably likeable guy. I'm serious,
though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to
be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature. But, I'm
also a serious guy. I think the presidency of the United States is
a very serious office. And I think we have to address these issues
in a very serious way.
   So, I hope and expect that I'll be liked by the people of this
country as president of the United States. I certainly hope I'll be
liked by them on the 8th of November. But, I also think it's
important to be somebody who's willing to make those tough choices.
Now, we've just heard two or three times from the vice president
that he's not going to raise taxes. I repeat, within days after you
made that pledge, you broke it. You said, ``Well, maybe as a last
resort, we'll do it,'' and you supported legislation this year
that's involved tax increases not once, but twice.
   So, that pledge isn't realistic, and I think the vice president
knows it. I think the people of this country know it. The fact of
the matter is that the next president of the United States is going
to have to go to the White House seriously, he's going to have to
work with the Congress seriously. He can't turn to the Congress and
blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and
that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink.
   And I'm going to be a president who is serious, I hope and
expect will be liked by the American people. But more than that,
will do the kind of job that I'm elected to do, will do it with as
much good humor as I can, but at the same time, will do it in a way
which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people.
And I think we know what they are --
   Moderator: Governor --
   Dukakis: -- a good strong future, a future in which there --
   Moderator: You're time has run out, sir.
   Dukakis: -- is opportunity for all of our citizens.
   Moderator: One minute from the vice president.
   Bush: I don't think it's a question of whether people like you
or not to make you an effective leader. I think it's whether you
share the broad dreams of the American people, whether you have
confidence in the people's ability to get things done, or whether
you think it all should be turned over, as many of the liberals do,
to Washington, D.C. You see, I think it's a question of values, not
likeability or lovability.
   It's a question in foreign affairs of experience, knowing world
leaders, knowing how to build on a superb record of this
administration in arms control because you'd know exactly how to
begin. You have to learn from experience that making unilateral
cuts in the defense system is not the way that you enhance the
peace.
   You've got to understand that it is only the United States that
can stand for freedom and democracy around the world, and we can't
turn it over to the United Nations or other multilateral
organizations. It is, though, trying to understand the heartbeat of
the country. And I know these campaigns get knocked a lot, but I
think I'd be a better president now --
   Moderator: Mr. Vice President --
   Bush: -- for having had to travel to these communities and
understand the family values and the importance of neighborhood.

   Moderator: Margaret Warner for the vice president.
   Q: I'd like to follow up on that, Mr. Vice President. The tenor
of the campaign you've been running in terms of both the issues and
your rhetoric has surprised even some of your friends. Sen. Mark
Hatfield has known your family a long time and who knew your
father, the late Sen. Prescott Bush, said, and I quote, ``If his
father were alive today I'm sure his father would see it as a
shocking transformation.''
   Is Sen. Hatfield right?
   Bush: What was he referring to?
   Warner: He was referring to your performance in the campaign.
   Bush: Well I think my dad would be pretty proud of me, because I
think we've come a long, long way. And I think, you know, three
months ago, I remember some of the great publications in this
country had written me off. And what I've had to do is to define
not just my position, but to define his (Dukakis). And I hope I've
done it fairly. And the reason I've had to do that is that he
(Dukakis) ran on the left in the Democratic primary, ran firmly and
ran with conviction, and ran on his record.
   And then, at the Democratic Convention, they made a
determination. And they said there ideology doesn't matter, just
competence. And in the process the negatives began. It wasn't me
that was there at that convention. Thank God, I was up with Jimmy
Baker camping out and I didn't have to hear all of the personal
attacks on me out of that Democratic convention. It was wonderful
not to have to listen to it. And I'm not the one that compared the
president of the United States of rotting like a dead fish from the
head down; I didn't do that.
   But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Gov.
Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these
very liberal positions. He's the one that said, ``I am a liberal --
traditional liberal -- progressive liberal Democrat.'' He's the one
that brought up, to garner primary votes, the whole question of the
ACLU. And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their
political agenda, not on their defending some minority opinion on
the right or the left. I support that. But what I don't like is
this left-wing political agenda, and therefore, I have to help
define that. And if he's unwilling to do it, if he says ideology
doesn't matter, I don't agree with him.
   Moderator: One minute, from Gov. Dukakis.
   Dukakis: Well, Margaret, we've heard it again tonight, and I'm
not surprised. The labels. I guess the vice president called me a
liberal two or three times, said I was coming from the left. In
1980, President Reagan called you a liberal for voting for federal
gun control. And this is something Republicans have used for a long
time. They tried it with Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman, and
John Kennedy. It's not labels, it's our vision of America, and we
have two fundamentally different visions of America.
   The vice president is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with
the status quo, doesn't think we ought to move ahead, thinks things
are okay as they are. I don't. I think this is a great country
because we've always wanted to do better, to make our country
better, to make our lives better. We've always been a nation which
was ambitious for America, and we move forward. And that's the kind
of America I want; that's the kind of leadership I want to provide.
   But I don't think these labels mean a thing, and I would hope
that tonight, and in the course of the rest of this campaign, we
can have our good, solid disagreements on issues; there's nothing
the matter with that. But let's stop labeling each other and let's
get to the heart of the matter, which is the future of this country.

   Q: Andrea Mitchell, for the Vice President.
   Q: Mr. Vice President, Governor. Mr. Vice President, let me
return for a moment to the issue of the budget, because so much has
already been put off limits in your campaign that most people do
not believe that the flexible freeze alone will solve the problem
of the deficit. So, let's turn to defense for a moment.
   Pentagon officials tell us that there is not enough money in the
budget to handle military readiness, preparedness, as well as new
weapons systems that have been proposed, as well as those already
in the pipeline. You were asked at the first debate what new
weapons systems you would cut. You mentioned three that had already
been canceled. Can you, tonight, share with us three new weapons
systems that you would cut?
   Bush: If I knew of three new weapons systems that I thought were
purely waste, and weren't protected by the Congress, they wouldn't
be in the budget. They would not be in the budget. But you want one
now? I'll give you one. That HEMAT, that heavy truck, that's cost,
what is it, $850 million and the Pentagon didn't request it and yet
a member of Congress, a very powerful one, put it in the budget.
   I think we can save money through this whole, very sophisticated
concept, Andrea, that I know you do understand, of competitive
strategies. It is new. And it is very, very different than what's
happened. But, it's not quite ready to be totally implemented. But,
it's very important. I think we can save through the Packard
Commission report, and I'm very proud that David Packard, the
originator of that report, is strongly supporting me. So, it's not
a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste. I don't
believe that.
   I do think this: we're in the serious stages of negotiation with
the Soviet Union now on the strategic arms control talks. And we
are protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our
strategic forces. My secretary of defense is going to have to make
a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with. But,
we are protecting both of them. We're moving forward with
negotiations. And, you see, I just think it would be dumb
negotiating policy with the Soviets, to cut out one or the other of
the two options right now. The Soviets are modernizing. They
continue to modernize. And we can't simply say, ``We've got enough
nuclear weapons. Let's freeze.'' We can't do that.
   We have to have modernization. Especially if we achieve the 50
percent reduction in strategic weapons that our president is taking
the leadership to attain. And, so, that's the way I'd reply to it.
And I believe we can have the strongest and best defense possible
if we modernize, if we go forward with competitive strategies, and
if we do follow through on the Packard Commission report.
   Q: Governor Dukakis, one minute.
   Dukakis: Well, Andrea, we've just had another example of why the
Vice President's mathematics just doesn't add up. I think you know,
because you've covered these issues, that there's no way that we
can build all of the weapons systems that the vice president says
he wants to build within the existing defense budget. Everybody
knows that, including the people at the Pentagon.
   Now, my defense secretary is going to have a lot to do with some
of those decisions, but it's going to be the president that's going
to have to ultimately decide, before that budget goes to the
Congress, what weapon systems are going to go and what are going to
stay. We're not going to spend the billions and trillions that Mr.
Bush wants to spend on Star Wars. We're not going to spend billions
on MXs on railroad cars, which is a weapon system we don't need,
can't afford, and won't help our defense posture at all. We're not
going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from
Washington to Tokyo.
   Those are decisions that the chief executive has to make. Yes,
we're going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear
deterrent. We're going to go forward with the Stealth, the D-5 and
the advanced cruise missile and good conventional forces. But the
next president of the United States will have to make some tough
and difficult decisions. I'm prepared to make them ...
   Q: Governor.
   Dukakis: ... the Vice President is not.

   Moderator: Andrea has a question for you.
   Q: Governor, continuing on that subject then, you say that we
have to do something about conventional forces. You have supported
the submarine-launched missile, the D-5, you just referred to. Yet,
from Jerry Ford to Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan, there has been a
bipartisan consensus in favor of modernizing the land-based
missiles. Now, you have ruled out the MX and the Midgetman. More
recently, some of your aides have hinted at some flexibility that
you might show about some other new form of missile. Can you tell
us tonight why you have rejected the collected wisdom of people as
diverse as Sam Nunn, Henry Kissinger, Al Gore, people in both
parties, and what type of land-based missile would you consider?
   Dukakis: Well, Andrea, today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear
warheads _ on land, on air and the sea. That's an incredibly
powerful nuclear deterrent. I don't rule out modernization and
there are discussions going on now in the Congress and over at the
Pentagon about a less expensive modernized land-based leg of the
triad.
   But there are limits to what we can spend. There are limits to
this nation's ability to finance these weapons systems. And one of
the things that the vice president either ignores or won't address
is the fact that you can't divorce our military security from our
economic security. How can we build a strong America militarily
that's teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt?
   And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the vice
president is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is
going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger. So military security
and economic security go hand in hand. And we will have a strong
and effective and credible nuclear deterrent. We're going to have
conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well
trained, well supported. And we have serious problems with our
conventional forces at the present time and they'll get worse
unless we have a president who's willing to make some of these
decisions.
   And we also have important domestic priorities in education and
housing and health care, in economic development and job training,
in the environment. Now, all of these things are going to have be
addressed. That's why I say again to all of you out there who have
to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is,
that the next president has to do the same.
   I want the men and women of our armed forces to have the support
they need to defend us, the support they need when they risk our
(sic) lives to keep us free and to keep this country free. But we
cannot continue to live on a credit card. We cannot continue to
tell the American people that we're going to build all of these
systems, and at the same time invest in important things here at
home, and be serious about building a strong and good America. And
that's the kind of America I want to build.
   Moderator: One minute for the vice president.
   Bush: I think the foremost -- Can we start the clock over? I
held off for the applause. Can I get --
   Moderator: You can proceed, sir.
   Bush: I think the foremost responsibility of a president really
gets down to the national security of this country. The governor
talks about limit, what we can't do, opposes these two
modernization systems, talks now about, ``May, well, we'll develop
some new kind of a missile.'' It takes eight years, 10 years to do
that.
   He talked about a nuclear freeze back at the time when I was in
Europe, trying to convince European public opinion that we ought to
go forward with the deployment of the INF weapons. And thank God
the freeze people were not heard. They were wrong. And the result
is, we deployed and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we
negotiated from strength. And now we have the first arms control
agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons. You just don't make
unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to
behave themselves. World peace is important, and we have enhanced
the peace. And I'm proud to have been a part of an administration
that has done exactly that. Peace through strength works.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Looks To Next Administration To Repair Relations</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-UN-Central America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign minister of Nicaragua said
Thursday that he hoped the next U.S. president would help repair
relations with his leftist government.
   Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto Brockmann told delegates to the
43rd General Assembly that ``the problem in Central America has a
first and last name. It is called U.S. intervention.
   ``When the United States stops making war on Nicaragua and stops
involving its lackeys in this war, then the international situation
will be immensely eased in Central America,'' D'Escoto said.
   The minister claimed the reputation of the United States had
sunk to an all-time low internationally, and ``all agree that the
dirty, immoral and illegal policy against Nicaragua is the basic
reason for this discredit.''
   ``Secretary of State (George) Shultz and a couple of his Latin
American friends may think differently, but that's another kettle
of fish,'' D'Escoto said.
   ``We were not intimidated in the military struggle against the
U.S. mercenary forces. We have defeated them,'' he said, referring
to the U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras. The United States
has supported the Contra since 1981, two years after the Sandinista
government came to power.
   Leftist rebels fighting El Salvador's U.S.-backed government and
the U.S.-backed Contras battling the Sandinistas both launch raids
from Honduran territory.
   ``We believe that it is possible to arrive at an understanding
with the United States and normalize our bilateral relations with
that country,'' D'Escoto added. ``With the next U.S. administration
we hope that might be possible.''
   The U.S. presidential elections between Democrat Michael
Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, and Vice President George
Bush, a Republican, is Nov. 8, with the winner taking office in
January.

   Moderator: Anne Compton for Gov. Dukakis.
   Q: Governor, today they may call them ``role models,'' but they
used to be called ``heroes,'' the kind of public figure who could
inspire a whole generation, someone who is larger than life. My
question is not, who your heroes were. My question instead is, who
are the heroes who are there in American life today? Who are the
ones that you would point out to young Americans as figures who
should inspire this country?
   Dukakis: Well, I think _ when I think of heroes, I think back
not presently, Anne, but there are many people who I admire in this
country today. Some of them are in public life, in the Senate and
the Congress _ some of my fellow governors who are real heroes to
me. I think of those young athletes who represented us at the
Olympics, who were tremendously impressive. We were proud of them.
We felt strongly about them and they did so well by us.
   I can think of doctors and scientists _ Jonas Salk who, for
example, discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread
diseases we ever had; and he's a hero. I think of classroom
teachers _ classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers
that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people
because they inspire them, they teach them, but more than that,
they are role models. Members of the clergy who have done the same.
Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to
youngsters who come up to me and others and ask for help and want
help and are doing the hard work, the heroic work which it takes to
provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind
of support.
   I think of people in the law enforcement community who are
taking their lives in their hands every day when they go up to one
of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs
into our communities and into our kids. So there are many, many
heroes in this country today. These are people that give of
themselves every day and every week and every month. In many cases
they're people in the community who are examples and are role
models.
   And I would hope that one of the things that I could do as
president is to recognize them, to give them the kind of
recognition that they need and deserve so that more and more young
people can themselves become the heroes of tomorrow, can go into
public service, can go into teaching, can go into drug counseling,
can go into law enforcement and be heroes themselves to generations
yet to come.
   Moderator: One minute for Vice President Bush.
   Bush: I think of a teacher right here _ largely Hispanic school
_ Jamie Escalante, teaching calculus to young kids, 80 percent of
them going on to college. I think of a young man now in this
country named Valladeres who was released from a Cuban jail; came
out and told the truth in this brilliant book, ``Against All Hope''
about what is actually happening in Cuba.
   I think of those people that took us back into space again _
Rick Hauck and that crew _ as people that are worthy of this. I
agree with the governor on athletics. And there's nothing corny
about having sports heroes, young people that are clean and
honorable and out there setting a _ setting the pace. I think of
Dr. Fauci _ probably never heard of him _ you did? (reference to
Ms. Compton) He's a very fine research, top doctor at the National
Institute of Health, working hard doing something about research on
this disease of AIDS.
   But look, I also think we ought to give a little credit to the
President of the United States. He is the one that has gotten us
that first arms control agreement and the cynics abounded _
   Moderator: Mr. Vice President _
   Bush: _ and he is leaving office with a popularity at an
all-time high _
   Moderator: Mr. Vice President, your time has expired _
   Bush: _ because American people say, he is our hero.

<HEAD>Air Force Says Safety Officer Did Not Mistakenly Destroy Missile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force on Thursday denied
that a safety officer mistakenly destroyed a Navy Trident 2
submarine missile as a Wisconsin congressman charged.
   ``The range safety officer acted within the parameters of the
mission flight rules by destroying the missile when he did,'' the
Air Force said in a statement issued at its Eastern Space and
Missile Center here. ``The missile was off course and continued to
veer off farther.''
   Pentagon sources in Washington indicated the test team might
have deliberately built an off-course maneuver into the flight path
to see how well the missile's guidance system reacted and that such
information may never have been transmitted to the range safety
officer.
   U.S. Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, said in Washington Wednesday, ``There's always
someone who doesn't get the word, and in this incident, it was the
man with his finger on the button.''
   The Trident 2 was launched Sept. 19 from Cape Canaveral as the
15th of 19 test flights planned from a land launch pad before the
weapon begins submarine test firings. The missile exploded about 60
seconds after liftoff.
   Aspin said the safety officer sent a radio signal to blow up the
missile when he mistakenly believed it was about to leave the range
safety corridor.
   ``It's the range safety officer's job to allow the missile to
fly as long as it can to achieve its test objective, but he also
must protect the public,'' the Air Force statement said. The Air
Force is responsible for safety on the missile test range.
   Aspin said in testing thus far, the Trident 2 series shows two
outright failures and one partial success. He said the destruction
of the 15th missile was counted as a ``no test'' because the
missile did not malfunction.
   ``Overall, test results indicate the missile is still meeting
its objectives,'' the congressman said.
   The Trident 2, capable of delivering 10 nuclear warheads to
different targets, will be the most powerful weapon in the Navy
arsenal when it becomes operational late next year. Each Trident
submarine carries 24 missiles.

   Q: Anne has a question for you, Mr. Vice President.
   Q: Let's change the pace a little bit, Mr. Vice President. In
this campaign, some hard and very bitter things have been spoken by
each side, about each side. If you'd consider for a moment Governor
Dukakis in his years of public service, is there anything nice you
can say about him, anything you find admirable?
   Bush: Hey, listen, you're stealing my close. I had something
very nice to say in that.
   Q: Somebody leaked my question to you?
   Bush: No, look, I'll tell you what, no, let me tell you
something about that. And Barbara and I were sitting there before
that Democratic convention, and we saw the governor and his son on
television the night before, and his family and his mother who was
there. And I'm saying to Barbara, ``You know, we've always kept
family as a bit of an oasis for us. You all know me, and we've held
it back a little.'' But we use that as a role model, the way he
took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to
him.
   And we've got a strong family and we watched that and we said,
``Hey, we've got to unleash the Bush kids.'' And so, you saw 10
grandchildren there jumping all over their grandfather at the, at
the convention. You see our five kids all over this country, and
their spouses. And so, I would say that the concept of the Dukakis
family has my great respect. And I'd say, I don't know whether
that's kind or not, it's just an objective statement. And I think
the man, anybody that gets into this political arena and has to
face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise because it's
gotten a little ugly out there, it's gotten a little nasty. It's
not much fun sometimes.
   And I would cite again Dan Quayle. I've been in politics a long
time and I don't remember that kind of piling on, that kind of ugly
rumor that never was true, printed. Now, come on. So, some of it's
unfair, but he's in the arena. Teddy Roosevelt used to talk about
the ``arena'' _you know, daring to fail greatly or succeed. No
matter, he's in there. So, I salute these things. I salute those
who participate in the political process.
   Sam Rayburn had a great expression on this. He said, ``You know,
I hear all of these intellectuals out there griping and complaining
and saying it's negative coverage.'' Rayburn says, ``Yeah, and that
guy never ran for sheriff either.'' Michael Dukakis has run for
sheriff, and so has George Bush.
   Q: Governor, a one-minute response, sir.
   Dukakis: I didn't hear the word ``liberal'' or ``left'' one
time. I thank you for that.
   Bush: That's not bad; that's true.
   Dukakis: And doesn't that prove the point, George, which is that
values like family, and education, community ...
   Bush: That's where you want to take the country.
   Dukakis: ... decent homes for young people _ that family in Long
Island I visited on Monday, where Lou and Betty Tulamo bought a
house for some $19,000 back in 1962, have had seven children.
They're all making good livings. They can't live in the community
in which they grew up in. Those are basic American values. I
believe in them, I think you believe in them. They're not left or
right, they're decent American values.
   I guess the one thing that concerns me about this, Anne, is this
attempt to label things which all of us believe in. We may have
different approaches, we may think that you deal with them in
different days, but they're basically American. I believe in them,
George Bush believes in them, I think the vast majority of
Americans believe in them, and I hope ...
   Q: Governor.
   Dukakis: ... the tone we've just heard might just be the tone we
have for the rest of the campaign. I think the American people
would appreciate that.

<HEAD>Judge Throws Out Local Franchise Fee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has declared
unconstitutional a franchise fee charged by the city of Palo Alto
to a local cable television company, a ruling described by a
company lawyer as the first of its kind.
   The ruling, if it stands, would save the cable company, Century
Federal, $900,000 a year, attorney Harold Farrow said Thursday. But
he said the potential impact of the issue is much greater because
more than 40 million homes in the nation have cable and at least 90
percent are with companies that pay franchise fees.
   ``I believe this is the first case in the whole country where
they held a franchise fee to be straightforwardly and without any
question unconstitutional,'' Farrow said, noting that a federal
appeals court in Philadelphia had ruled to the contrary.
   He called the ruling a victory for freedom of the press.
   Jerome Falk, a lawyer for Palo Alto and several neighboring
communities that joined in assessing the franchise fee, declined
comment.
   The decision by U.S. District Judge Eugene Lynch, issued
Wednesday, declared that the franchise fee discriminated against
cable operators, in violation of constitutional freedom of
expression.
   Palo Alto said the fee, which is 5 percent of a company's gross
revenue, was justified as rent for use of the city's right-of-way
to place cables.
   Lynch said the fee was discriminatory because Pacific Bell,
which uses the same right-of-way for its telephone lines, is not
charged any fee as its access is guaranteed by state law. Also,
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is charged only a 2 percent fee for use
of a public right-of-way by the neighboring city of Atherton, a
defendant in the cable case.
   The 5 percent fee ``is aimed exclusively at cable television
operators engaged in speech protected by the First Amendment,''
Lynch said.
   He also said the city's goal of raising money could have been
met by a non-discriminatory fee.
   Farrow, who represents several cable companies that have fought
local restrictions, said Century Federal had signed up 50,000
subscribers in the Palo Alto area, paying an average of $30 a month.

   Moderator: Margaret Warner, for the vice president.
   Q: Vice President Bush, abortion remains with us as a very
troubling issue, and I'd like to explore that for a minute with
you. You have said that you regard abortion as murder, yet you
would make exceptions in the cases of rape and incest. My question
is, why should a woman who discovers through amniocentesis that her
baby will be born with Tay-Sachs disease, for instance, that the
baby will live at most two years, and those two years in incredible
pain, be forced to carry the fetus to term, and yet a woman who
becomes pregnant through incest would be allowed to abort her fetus?
   Bush: Because you left out one other exception, the health of
the mother. Let me answer your question, and I hope it doesn't get
too personal, or maudlin. Bar and I lost a child, you know that. We
lost a daughter, Robin. And we took -- we were out -- I was over
running records in West Texas, and I got a call from her -- ``Come
home.'' Went to the doctor. The doctor said _ beautiful child _
``Your child has a few weeks to live.'' And I said, ``What can we
do about it?'' He said, ``No, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a
few weeks to live.'' We took the child to New York. Thanks to the
miraculous sacrifices of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive
for six months, and then died.
   If that child were here today, and I was told this same thing --
my granddaughter Noel, for example -- that child could stay alive
for 10 or 15 years, or maybe for the rest of her life. And so, I
don't think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge
at the time. I think human life is very, very precious.
   And look, this hasn't been an easy decision for me to make --
work -- meet. I know others disagree with it. But, when I was in
that little church across the river from Washington and saw our
grandchild christened in our faith, I was very pleased indeed that
the mother had not aborted that child, and put the child up for
adoption. And, so, I just feel this is where I'm coming from. And
it is personal. And I don't assail him on that issue or others on
that issue. But, that's the way I, George Bush, feel about it.
   Moderator: One minute for Governor Dukakis.
   Dukakis: Margaret. Kitty and I had very much the same kind of
experience that the Bushes had. We lost a baby -- lived about 20
minutes after it was born. But, isn't the real question that we
have to answer, not how many exceptions we make -- because the vice
president himself is prepared to make exceptions -- it's who makes
the decision, who makes this very difficult, very wrenching
decision.
   And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own
conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision. Who are
we to say, ``Well, under certain circumstances it's all right, but
under other circumstances it isn't?'' That's a decision that only a
woman can make after consulting her conscience and consulting her
religious principles. And I would hope that we would give to women
in this country the right to make that decision, and to make it in
the exercise of their conscience and religious beliefs.

   Moderator: Governor -- Margaret has a question for you.
   Q: Governor -- I'd like to return to the topic of the defense
budget for a minute. You have said in this campaign, that, you
would maintain a stable defense budget. Yet, you are on the board _
on the advisory _
   Dukakis: And incidentally, may I say that _ that that's the
decision of the Congress, and the president has concurred.
   Q: Yet you are on the board of a group called Jobs With Peace in
Boston, that advocates a 25 percent cut in the defense budget, and
the transfer of that money to the domestic economy. My question is:
Do you share that goal, perhaps as a long-range goal? And if not,
are you aware of, or why do you permit this group to continue to
use your name on its letterhead for fund-raising?
   Dukakis: Well, I think I was on the advisory committee,
Margaret. No, I don't happen to share that goal. It's an example of
how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations, all of
whose particular positions we don't support _ even though we
support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can
get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a
comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet
Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe
with deeper cuts in the Soviet side _ yes, at some point it may be
possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important
things here at home, like jobs and job training and college
opportunity and health and housing and the environment, and the
things that all of us care about.
   But I do think this: That the next president, even within a
relatively stable budget _ and that's what we're going to have for
the foreseeable future _ we'll have to make those tough choices
that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesn't seem to want to
make. And that really is going to be a challenge for the next
president of the United States. I don't think there's any question
about it.
   But I also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with
the Soviet Union, to build on the progress that we've made with the
INF Treaty _ which I strongly supported, and most Democrats did _
to get those reductions in strategic weapons, to get a test ban
treaty, and to really make progress on the reduction of
conventional forces in Europe.
   And if we can do that, and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts
on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from _ then I
think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move
some of our resources from the military to important domestic
priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young
woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from
Longview, Texas _ two teachers, a mother and a father who have a
child that's a freshman in college, who's an electrical engineering
major, a very bright student _ and they can't afford to keep that
child in college.
   So I hope that we can begin to move those resources. It's not
going to happen overnight. It certainly will have to happen on a
step-by-step basis as we make progress in arms negotiation and arms
control and arms reduction. But it certainly ought to be _
   Moderator: Governor _
   Dukakis: _ a long-term goal of all Americans, and I think it is.
   Moderator: One minute for the vice president.
   Bush: The defense budget today takes far less percentage of the
gross national product than it did in President Kennedy's time. For
example _ moved tremendously _ and you see, I think we're facing a
real opportunity for world peace. This is a big question. And it's
a question as to whether the United States will continue to lead
for peace. See, I don't believe any other country can pick up the
mantel.
   I served at the U.N. (United Nations). I don't think we can turn
over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the
United Nations or anything else. So, what I'm saying is, we are
going to have to make choices. I said I would have the secretary of
defense sit down. But while the president is negotiating with the
Soviet Union, I simply do not want to make these unilateral cuts.
   And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point
that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a
principle _ asymmetrical cuts. The Soviets take out more than we do
and the principle of intrusive verification. And those two
principles can now be applied to conventional forces, to strategic
forces, provided _
   Moderator: Mr. Vice President _
   Bush: _ we don't give away our hand before we sit down at the
head table.

   Q: Andrea Mitchell for Governor Dukakis.
   Q: Governor, you've said tonight that you set as a goal the
steady reduction of the deficit. And you've talked about making
tough choices, so perhaps I can get you to make one of those tough
choices. No credible economist in either party accepts as realistic
your plan to handle the deficit by tightening tax collection,
investing in economic growth, bringing down interest rates, and
cutting weapons systems ...
   Dukakis: And some domestic programs as well, Andrea.
   Q: And some domestic programs as well. So, let's assume now, for
argument purpose, that it is the spring of 1989 and you are
President Dukakis, and you discover that all of those economists
were right and you were wrong. You are now facing that dreaded last
resort -- increase taxes. Which tax do you decide is the least
onerous?
   Dukakis: May I disagree with the premise of your question?
   Q: For the sake of argument, no.
   Dukakis: As a matter of reality, I'm going to have to because we
have had not one but two detailed studies which indicate that there
are billions and billions of dollars to be collected that are not
being paid in. These are not taxes owed by average Americans. We
don't have an alternative. We lose it when it's taken out of our
paycheck before we even get it. But it's the Internal Revenue
Service which estimates now that we aren't collecting $100 billion
or more in taxes owed in this country. And that is just absolutely
unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and
pay them on time.
   The Dorgan Task Force, which included two internal revenue
commissioners, one a Republican _ former internal revenue
commissioners _ one a Republican, one a Democrat. It was a
bipartisan commission, a study by two respected economists, which
indicated that we could collect some 40, 45, $50 billion of those
funds. The point is you've got to have a president who's prepared
to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who
as a governor of a state that's had very, very successful
experience at doing this. In my own state, we did it. In other
states, we've done it. Republican governors as well as Democratic
governors. And we've had great success at revenue enforcement.
   Now, the vice president will probably tell you that it's going
to take an army of IRS collectors again. Well, his campaign
manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking
great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the
Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue
agents to go out and collect these funds and I'm happy to join Jim
Baker in saying that we agree on this.
   But, the fact of the matter is that this is something that we
must begin, it's going to take at least the first year of the new
administration. But the Dorgan Task Force, the bipartisan task
force, estimated that we could collect about $35 billion in the
fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more
than that ...
   Q: Governor.
   Dukakis: ... and that's where you begin.
   Q: One minute response, Mr. Vice President.
   Bush: Well, Andrea, you didn't predicate that lack of
economist's support for what I call a flexible freeze cause some
good, very good economists do support that concept. And I think
where I differ with the governor of Massachusetts is, I am
optimistic. They jumped on me yesterday for being a little
optimistic about the United States. I am optimistic and I believe
we can keep this longest expansion going.
   I was not out there when that stock market dropped, wringing my
hands and saying this was the end of the world, as some political
leaders were. Cause it isn't the end of the world. And what we have
to do is restrain the growth of spending. And we are doing a better
job of it. The Congress is doing a better job of it. And the
dynamics work. But they don't work if you go raise taxes and then
the Congress spends it, continues to spend that. The American
working man and woman are not taxed too little, the federal
government continues to spend too much. (Applause) Hold it.

   Moderator: Mr. Vice President, Andrea has a question for you.
   Q: Mr. Vice President, you have flatly ruled out any change in
social security benefits, even for the wealthy. Now, can you stand
here tonight and look a whole generation of 18 to 34 year olds in
the eye, the very people who are going to have to be financing that
retirement, and tell them that they should be financing the
retirement of people like yourself, like Governor Dukakis, or for
that matter, people such as ourselves here on this panel.
   Bush: More so you than me. But --
   Q: -- We could argue about that.
   Bush: -- No, but, you've got to go back to what Social Security
was when it was created. It wasn't created as a welfare program, it
wasn't created -- it was created as a whole retirement or health
supplement to retirement program. It wasn't created as a welfare
program. So here's what's happened. We came into office and the
Social Security Trust Fund was in great jeopardy. And the President
took the leadership, working with the Democrats and the Republicans
in Congress. Some tough calls were made and the Social Security
Trust Fund was put back into sound, solvent condition.
   So I don't want to fool around with it. And there's several --
there's a good political reason, because it's just about this time
of year that the Democrats start saying: ``The Republicans are
going to take away your Social Security.'' It always works that
way. I've seen it in precinct politics in Texas, and I've seen it
at the national level.
   We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound, and it is
going to be operating at surpluses. And I don't want the liberal
Democratic Congress to spend out of that Social Security Trust Fund
or go and take the money out for some other purpose. I don't want
that. And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social
Security. I learned that the hard way.
   And the Governor and I both supported slipping the COLAs for one
year; he supported it at the National Governor's Conference, and I
supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package. And
we got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that. And I
am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our
commitment to the elderly. And maybe down the line, maybe when you
get two decades or one into the next century, you're going to have
to take another look at it, but not now. We do not have to do it.
Keep the trust with the older men and women of this country.
   Moderator: Governor, you have one minute, sir.
   Dukakis: Andrea, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening
to. George Bush, a few years ago, said that Social Security was
basically a welfare system. And in 1985 he flew back from the West
Coast to cut that COLA. I voted against that at the National
Governor's Association. We won a majority; we didn't win the
two-thirds that was necessary in order to pass that resolution,
George, but everybody knew what we were doing, and I've opposed
that.
   The reason that we raised concerns not just in election years,
but every year, is because Republicans, once they're elected, go in
there and start cutting. You did it in 1985. The administration
tried to do it repeatedly, repeatedly in '81, '82, and I'm sure
you'll try to do it again because there's no way that you can
finance what you want to spend, there's no way you can pay for that
five-year, $40 billion tax cut for the rich and still buy all those
weapon systems you want to buy, unless you raid the Social Security
Trust Fund.

<HEAD>Secret Marcos Papers Show Plans To Become Dictator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ferdinand Marcos fostered unrest against his
own government to justify dictatorial powers, according to a
journal handwritten by the ousted Philippine president, the Los
Angeles Times reported Thursday.
   ``I have that feeling of certainty that I will end up with
dictatorial powers if the situation continues _ and the situation
will continue,'' Marcos wrote in 1970.
   The papers indicate that Marcos deceived U.S. officials who have
long sought good relations with the Philippines because of the
country's strategic location and vast U.S. military installations.
   For example, Marcos told Ambassador Henry A. Byroade that he
suspected China of supplying arms to Maoist revolutionaries just a
few months after Marcos wrote in the papers that it appeared no
foreign powers were providing the revolutionaries with arms, the
Times said.
   The papers are reportedly part of a larger manuscript discovered
in the presidential palace after Marcos fled Manila in the
bloodless revolution that brought Corazon Aquino to power in
February 1986.
   Marcos lives in exile in Hawaii. His spokesman, Gemmo Trinidad,
blasted the papers' release as ``an invasion of privacy'' and said
Marcos may go to court over it.
   The papers also show that Marcos expected Maoist rebels would
try to spark a revolution, but he acknowledged that they and other
groups were weak.
   ``We should allow them to gather strength, but not such strength
that we cannot overcome them,'' a Feb. 17, 1970, entry says.
   Marcos worked his plan for absolute power cautiously, the papers
say.
   ``I must continue to restrain myself lest we lose the support of
the people by a stance of tyranny,'' another entry says.
   By March 1970, however, Marcos was losing patience as nonviolent
demonstrations were not disruptive enough for him, the papers say.
   ``The disorders must now be induced into a crisis so stricter
measures can be taken,'' a March 3, 1970, entry says.
   Another entry says: ``A little more destruction and vandalism,
and I can do anything.''
   James Miller, an independent handwriting analyst hired by the
newspaper, checked them against formal degrees written by Marcos
and found ``virtually everything was consistent.''
   The entries start on New Year's Eve of 1970, just after Marcos
was re-elected to his second term as president in an election
marked by allegations of vote fraud.
   One month later he started outlining his ``total solution,'' an
elaborate scheme to ``liquidate'' Communists and silence opposition
political leaders and media critics through mass arrests.
   The plan started taking shape 32 months before he declared
martial law and while he presented himself as a champion of
democracy, the papers show.
   Meanwhile, in Honolulu, more than a dozen relatives and
supporters of Marcos have been subpoenaed to appear before a
federal grand jury that apparently is investigating an alleged 1987
plot to return Marcos to power.
   Trinidad said those subpoenaed include Marcos' daugther, Irene,
and her husband, Gregorio Araneta.
   Marcos denounced the subpoenas as ``pure and simple harassment.''
   The U.S. Justice Department, through the FBI, has been
investigating possible violations by Marcos supporters in Hawaii
and California of the Neutrality Act with regard to the Philippines.
   Supporters of Marcos allegedly provided a private Boeing 707
that flew into Honolulu last year but departed without Marcos after
federal agents threatened to restrain him if he tried to leave.
   U.S. officials are convinced that Marcos continues to try to
destabilize the government of President Corazon Aquino. Marcos
denies such efforts.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sandinista government on Thursday
ordered off the air a private radio newscast for broadcasting an
interview in which the president and interior minister were called
``monsters.''
   An Interior Ministry communique said the news program El
Nicaraguense had been indefinitely suspended for ``its defamatory
campaign against the government.'' The program is run by the
opposition Superior Council of Private Enterprise and broadcast by
the private Radio Mundial station.
   The statement said an interview with Nicaraguan rebel leader
William Montalvan, which was aired Wednesday, ``slandered the
government ... and its leaders.''
   The communique quoted Montalvan, who is based in Costa Rica, as
saying in the interview that ``(Interior Minister Tomas) Borge and
(President Daniel) Ortega are monsters.
   ``Here in exile, there isn't a day that goes by without my
hearing of another Nicaraguan being jailed. There isn't a day that
goes by without the economic situation of our people getting worse
because of the totalitarian policy of the Sandinista regime,''
Montalvan was quoted as saying.
   The communique said El Nicaraguense was taken off the air under
provisions of a media law that calls for permanent closure of
repeat violators of the law.
   In May, the government prohibited Radio Mundial from
broadcasting its regular news programs for eight days. The official
Sandinista newspaper Barricada said the station was accused of
``spreading false information'' about a workers' hunger strike and
of violating laws preserving public order.
   The U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, have opposed the
Sandinistas since the leftist government came to power in 1979.

   Moderator: Ann Compton for the vice president.
   Q: Mr. Vice President, there are three justices of the Supreme
Court who are in their eighties, and it's very likely the next
president will get a chance to put a lasting mark on the Supreme
Court. For the record, would your nominees to the Supreme Court
have to pass something that has been called a kind of conservative
ideological litmus test, and would you give us an idea of perhaps
who two or three people on your short list are for the court?
   Bush: Well one, I don't have a list yet. I feel pretty confident
tonight, but not that confident. And secondly -- secondly, I don't
have any litmus test. But, what I would do is appoint people to the
federal bench that will not legislate from the bench, who will
interpret the Constitution. I do not want to see us go to again _
and I'm using this word advisedly _ a liberal majority that is
going to legislate from the bench.
   They (Dukakis supporters) don't like the use of the word, but
may I remind his strong supporters that only last year in the
primary to capture that Democratic nomination, he said, ``I am a
progressive liberal Democratic.'' I won't support judges like that.
   There is no litmus test on any issue. But, I will go out there
and find men and women to interpret. And I don't have a list, but I
think the appointments that the president has made to the bench
have been outstanding, outstanding appointments _
   Ms. Compton: Including Bork, including Bork?
   Bush: Yeah.
   Moderator: Governor --
   Bush: _ I supported him.
   Moderator: _ you have a one-minute reponse time.
   DUKAKIS: If the Vice President of the United States thinks that
Robert Bork was an outstanding appointment, that is a very good
reason for voting for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen on the 8th of
November. And I think Mr. Bush supported the Bork nomination.
   You know Mr. Bush has never appointed a judge. I've appointed
over 130, so I have a record _ and I'm very proud of it. I don't
ask people whether they're Republicans or Democrats. I've appointed
prosecutors, I've appointed defenders. I don't appoint people I
think are liberal, or people who I think are conservative; I
appoint people of independence and integrity and intelligence,
people who will be a credit to the bench. And those are the
standards that I will use in nominating people to the Supreme Court
of the United States.
   These appointments are for life -- these appointments are for
life, and when the vice president talks about liberals on the
bench, I wonder who he's talking about? Is he talking about a
former governor of the state of California, who was a former
prosecutor _
   Moderator: Governor _
   Dukakis: _ a Republican, named Earl Warren? Because I think
Chief Justice Warren was an outstanding chief justice, and I think
most Americans do too.

   Q: Anne Compton has a question for you, Governor Dukakis.
   Q: Governor, millions of Americans are entitled to some of the
protections and benefits that the federal government provides,
including Social Security, pensions, Medicare for the elderly,
Medicaid for the poor. But in fact, there are so many millions of
Americans who are eligible that government just can't continue to
pay for all of those programs as they're currently constituted. A
blue ribbon panel, shortly after the election, is likely to
recommend that you go where the money is when you make budget cuts,
and that means entitlements. Before the election, would you commit
yourself to any of those hard choices, such as which one of those
entitlements ought to be redrawn?
   Dukakis: Andrea, why do people who want to balance budgets, or
bring the deficit down, always go to those programs which tend to
benefit people of very modest means? You know, two-thirds of the
people in this country who receive Social Security checks live
entirely on that check, they have no other income. And yet, Mr.
Bush tried to cut their cost of living increase in 1985.
   Medicare is not getting less expensive; medical care for the
elderly is getting more expensive, with greater deductibles, with
fewer benefits, the kinds of things that we've had under this
administration, that have cut and chopped and reduced the kinds of
benefits that one gets under Medicare. Yes, we now have
catastrophic health insurance, but it's gonna cost. And that's
going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens. It had
bipartisan support; it should have had bipartisan support, but I
suggest that we understand that those are going to be additional
costs on senior citizens across this country.
   So I'm not going to begin, and I'm not going to go to
entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit, when we're
spending billions on something like Star Wars, when we're spending
billions on other weapon systems which apparently the vice
president wants to keep in his back pocket, or someplace, but
which, if we continue to spend billions on them, will force us to
cut Social Security, to cut Medicare, to cut these basic
entitlements to people of very, very modest means.
   Now there are some things we can do to help people who currently
do get entitlements to get off of public assistance. I talked in
our first debate about the possibilities of helping millions and
millions of welfare families to get off of welfare, and I'm proud
to say that we finally have a welfare reform bill. And the Ruby
Sampsons and Dawn Lawsons, hundreds of thousands of welfare mothers
in this country and in my state and across the country who today
are working and earning are examples of what can happen when you
provide training for those welfare mothers, some day care for their
children so that those mothers can go into a training program and
get a decent job.
   Q: Governor ...
   Dukakis: That's the way you bring a deficit down, and help to
improve the quality of life for people at the same time.
   Q: One minute for the vice president.
   Bush: I think I've addressed it, but let me simply say for the
record, I did not vote to cut COLAs. And I voted the same way that
he did three months before in a National Governors conference, and
he said at that time, quote, and this is a paraphrase _ A freeze,
that's easy. So I don't believe that we need to do what you've
suggested here, and I've said that I'm going to keep the Social
Security entitlement, to keep that trust fund sound.
   But I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the
pressing problems, particularly that affect our children. And I
have made some good, sound proposals. But again, we've got a big
difference on child care, for example. You see, I want the families
to have the choice. I want, I don't want to see the federal
government licensing grandmothers. I don't want to see the federal
government saying to communities, ``Well, you can't do this
anymore. We're going to tell you how to do it all.''
   I want flexibility. And I do, you know, these people laugh about
the thousand points of life. You ought to go out and _ light _ you
ought to go out and see around this country what's happening in the
volunteer sector, American helping American. And I want to keep it
alive in child care ...
   Q: Mr. Vice President ...
   Bush: ... and in other entitlements.

   Moderator: Margaret Warner, for Governor Dukakis.
   Q: Governor, I'm going to pass on the question I originally
planned to ask you to follow up on your rebuttal to a question
Andrea asked, and that involves Social Security. Now it is true, as
you said, that originally you sought an exemption for Social
Security COLAs in this National Governors Association vote.
   Dukakis: Right.
   Q: But, when you lost that vote, you, then, endorsed the
over-all freeze proposal. And what's more, you had great criticism
of your fellow governors who wouldn't go along as political
cowards. You said-- ``It takes guts, and it takes will.''
   Dukakis: That is absolutely not true, Margaret. No, that is
absolutely -- that is absolutely not true. It had nothing to do
with the debate on Social Security. It had to do with the
discussion we had had the previous day on the ove-all question of
reducing the budget.
   Q: My question is aren't you demagoguing the Social Security
issue?
   Dukakis: No, and I have to -- I have to -- I just have to
correct the record. That simply isn't true. Now, we're not a
parlimentary body -- the National Governors Association. We vote on
resolutions. If you don't get a two-thirds, then your resolution
doesn't pass. But, everybody knew that those of us who voted
against the freezing of COLAs did so -- we did so emphatically and
I never made that statement -- never would.
   The point is, that, as we look at this nation's future, and we
have two very different visions of this future -- I want to move
ahead. The vice president talks about a thousand points of light.
I'm interested in 240 million points of light. I'm interested in
240 million citizens in this country who -- who share in the
American dream _ all of them, in every part of this country.
   But, as we look at the decisions that the next president of the
United States is going to have to make, I just don't believe the
place you go first is those programs, those so-called entitlements
which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount of
medical care for the elderly, for the disabled, for people who
can't make their way on their own, and in many cases have given a
great deal to this country.
   The vice president did call Social Security a few years ago
basically or largely a welfare program. It isn't. It's a contract
between generations. It's something that we pay into now so that we
will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents
will have a secure retirement. It's a very sacred contract, and I
belive in it. So that's not where we ought to go.
   There are plenty of places to cut. There's lots we can do in the
Pentagon where dishonest contractors have been lining their pockets
at the expense of the American taxpayer. There are -- we certainly
ought to be able to give our farm families a decent income without
spending 20 to 25 billion dollars a year in farm subsidies and I'm
sure we can do that. That's where we ought to go and those are the
programs that we ought to review first.
   Moderator: One minute for the vice president.
   Bush: Well, let me take him up on this question of farm
subsidies. We have a fundamental difference approach on
agriculture. He favors this supply maintenance or production
controls. He said that. He's been out in the states saying that in
these midwestern states. I don't. I think the farm bill that he
criticizes was good legislation, outstanding legislation. And I
believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the
government further involved, but to do what I'm suggesting.
   First place, never go back to that Democratic grain embargo,
that liberal Democrat grain embargo that knocked the markets right
out from under us and made Mr. Gorbachev say to me, when he was
here, ``How do I know you're reliable suppliers?'' We never should
go back to that. And we ought to expand our markets abroad. We
ought to have rural enterprise zones. We ought to move forward
swiftly on my ideas of ethanol, which would use more corn and
therefore make, create a bigger market for our agricultural
products. But let's not go back and keep assailing a farm bill that
passed with overwhelming Democrat and Republican support.
   Moderator: Mr. Vice President --
   Bush: The farm payments are going down because the agricultural
economy is coming back.

<HEAD>U.N. Resolution Calls For `Non-Return' of Cambodian Pol Pot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. Cambodia resolution calls for the
10th straight year for withdrawal of Vietnamese forces, but this
time also specifies ``non-return'' of Pol Pot's genocidal policies
in trying for a breakthrough.
   Increasingly, the issue of Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot and how to
prevent his return to power is seen as a major stumbling block in
achieving a Vietnamese troop withdrawal, a political settlement and
a non-aligned Cambodia.
   China's U.N. Mission indicated on Tuesday that the Beijing
government could accept Pol Pot and his circle as refugees under
Chinese law, but the statement did not specifically mention the
ailing Communist leader.
   Although a formal offer of refuge for Pol Pot has not been made
and details remain to be worked out, diplomats here see China's new
willingness to offer sanctuary as a major, positive development in
resolving the problem.
   China has been a strong supporter and arms supplier of the Khmer
Rouge, the strongest anti-Vietnamese fighting force, but has
distanced itself from Pol Pot's policies.
   The Cambodia resolution has been adopted overwhelmingly every
year since the December 1978 invasion of Cambodia by Vietnamese
troops to oust Pol Pot, who presided over the deaths of at least 1
million Cambodians in the 1970s.
   The United Nations is expected to play a major role in any
Cambodian settlement, possibly providing a peacekeeing force and
observers to supervise a Vietnamese troop withdrawal and free
elections.
   The non-communist Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
has been drafting the resolution for 10 years. It introduced major
changes this year to reflect the dialogue between Cambodian
factions and the desire to exclude Pol Pot from any major role in
Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge, led by Khieu Samphan, is the strongest of three
factions fighting the Vietnamese. The others are non-communist
factions led by former Cambodian Prime Minister Son Sann and Prince
Norodom Sihanouk. The prince is expected to become the head of a
future coalition government.
   The resolution last year was adopted by a vote of 117 to 21,
with 16 abstentions.
   This year, the ``yes'' vote could be even higher, according to
Asian diplomats. While Vietnam, the Soviet Union and their friends
are expected to oppose it again, the reference to excluding Pol Pot
is considered a welcome change.
   The draft resolution calls for the following new elements:
   _The ``non-return to the universally condemned policies and
practices of a recent past'' _ a reference to the documented deaths
blamed on the Pol Pot regime. The passage is taken directly from
the secretary-general's own report on Cambodia issued Oct. 17, 1985.
   The Khmer Rouge and others call that reference an unacceptable
interference in Cambodia's internal affairs, but Asian diplomats
familiar with the resolution say the secretary-general's own
language carries considerable weight and will be difficult to
change.
   _The ``effective international supervision and control'' of the
withdrawal of about 130,000 Vietnamese troops and ``effective
guarantees'' providing for a pull-out.
   _An ``interim administering authority'' _ or a coalition
government, also bolstered by ``effective guarantees'' by the
international community.
   _The ``promotion of national reconciliation among all Cambodians
under the leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk.''
   A future coalition government is expected to include the three
Cambodian factions fighting the Vietnamese as well as the
Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh.
   Asian diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, say China
is not enthusiastic about the language condemning Khmer Rouge
atrocities, but it strongly opposes Vietnam's occupation of
Cambodia and is expected to support the resolution again.
   A draft copy of the resolution was provided to The Associated
Press by foreign diplomats and the document was expected to be
formally introduced Friday or early next week.

<HEAD>LOS ANGELES: coming back.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Moderator: Margaret Warner has a question for you, Mr. Vice
President.
   Q: Mr. Vice President, I'd like to cover a subject that wasn't
covered in the first debate. You have said in this campaign, ``I am
an environmentalist,'' and described yourself as having zero
tolerance for polluters. And yet your record does seem to suggest
otherwise.
   When you were head of the President's Task Force of Regulatory
Relief, you did urge EPA to relax regulations involving the
elimination of lead from gasoline. I believe you urged suspension
of rules requiring industries to treat toxic wastes before
discharging them in sewers. And your group also urged OSHA to
weaken the regulations requiring that workers be informed of
dangerous chemicals at the worksite.
   Finally, I believe you did support the President's veto of the
Clean Water Act. And my question is, aren't you -- how do you
square your campaign rhetoric with this record?
   Bush: Ninety percent reductions in lead since I chaired that
regulatory task force -- ninety percent. It's all -- do you
remember that expression -- ``Get the lead out'' -- it's almost
out. Almost gone. Clean water -- I'm for clean water -- but what
I'm not for, what I'm not for is measuring it the way the
Democratic Congress does.
   We sent up a good bill on clean water, a sound bill on clean
water, but the only way you can express your love for clean water
is to double the appropriations for clean water and then rant
against the deficit. I am for clean water. I've been an outdoorsman
and a sportsman all my life. I've been to these national parks. I
led for the Earl-Wallop bill, or what formerly Dingell-Johnson. I
headed the Task Force when I was a member of the Congress way back
in the late '60s on these kinds of things on the Republican side. I
led for that. And so I refuse to -- to measure one's commitment as
to whether you're going to double the spending. That is the same
old argument that'd gotten us into the trouble on the deficit side.
   So I'll just keep saying: I am one. I'm not going to go down
there and try to dump the sludge from Massachussetts off the
beaches off of New Jersey -- (boos from the audience) -- I'm not
going to do that. That boo was excessively loud. Can you add five
seconds, Bernie, out of fairness? Come on! Give me five. I mean
this guy -- this is too much down there.
   But I'm not gonna do that. I am an evironmentalist. I believe in
our parks; I believe in the President's Commission on Outdoors. And
I'll do a good job because I am committed.
   Moderator: Governor Dukakis, you have one minute to respond.
   Dukakis: Bernard, I'm not sure I can get all of this in in one
minute. George, we have supply management today under the 1985
bill, it's called ``set asides.'' Secondly, if you were so opposed
to the grain embargo, why did you ask the godfather of the grain
embargo to be one of your top foreign policy advisors?
   I'm against the grain embargo; it was a mistake. I'm also
against the pipeline embargo which you folks attempted to impose;
that was a mistake as well, and cost thousands of jobs for American
workers in the Midwest and all over the United States of America.
   Margaret, once again, I don't know which George Bush I'm talking
about here, or looking at -- the George Bush who was a charter
member of the environmental wrecking crew that went to Washington
in the early '80s and did a job on the EPA, or the one we've been
seeing and listening to the past two or three months. But let me
say this, because he spent millions and millions of dollars on
advertising on the subject of Boston Harbor: George, Boston Harbor
was polluted for 100 years. I'm the first Governor to clean it up.
No thanks to you -- no thanks to you. And we've been cleaning it up
for four years --
   Moderator: Governor --
   Dukakis: -- we passed landmark legislation in '84. No thanks to
you. Did everything you could to kill the Clean Water Act and the
those grants --
   Moderator: Governor --
   Dukakis: -- which make it possible for states and local
communities to clean up rivers and harbors and streams.

   Q: Andrea Mitchell has a question for you, Mr. Vice President.
   Q: Mr. Vice President, Jimmy Carter has called this the worst
campaign ever. Richard Nixon has called it trivial, superficial and
inane. Whoever started down this road first of negative
campaigning, the American people, from all reports coming to us,
are completely fed up. Now, do you have any solutions to suggest?
Is there time left to fix it? There are 26 days left. For instance,
would you agree to another debate before it's all over so that the
American people, so that the American people would have another
chance before Election Day to compare you two?
   Bush: No, I will not agree to another debate. The American
people are up to here with debates. They had 30 of them. We had 7
of them. Now we got three of them. I am going to carry this
election debate all across this country in the last, whatever
remains of the last three-and-a-half weeks or whatever we have. And
the answer is no. I am not going to have any more debates. We don't
need any more debates. I've spelled out my position.
   In terms of negative campaigning, you know, I don't want to
sound like a kid in a schoolyard _ ``He started it.'' But, take a
look at the Democratic convention, take a look at it. Do you
remember the senator from Boston chanting out there and the
ridicule factor from that lady from Texas that was on there? I
mean, come on. This was just outrageous. But, I'll try harder to
keep it on a high plane.
   But, let me, let me _ if you could accept a little criticism. I
went all across central Illinois and spoke about agricultural
issues in about seven stops. We had some fun _ Crystal Gayle and
Loretta Lynn with us and they got up and sang. We went to little
towns and I talked agriculture. And not one thing did I see, with
respect, on your network about my views on agriculture and not one
did I read in any newspaper. Why? Cause you're so interested in a
poll that might have been coming out. Or because somebody had said
something nasty about somebody else.
   And, so, I don't know what the answer is. I don't _ somebody hit
me and said Barry Goldwater said you ought to talk on the issues
more. How can Barry Goldwater, sitting in Arizona, know whether I'm
talking on the issues or not, when we put out position paper after
position paper, he puts out position paper after position paper,
and we see this much about it because everyone else is fascinated
with polls and who's up or down today and who's going to be up or
down tomorrow.
   So, I think we can all share, with respect, in the fact that
maybe these, the message is not getting out. But, it's not getting
out because they're too few debates. There will be no more debates.
   Q: Governor Dukakis, you have one minute to respond, sir.
   Dukakis: Well, I can understand, after the vice presidential
debate why Mr. Bush would want no more debates. (Boos.) That's my
five seconds, George. Andrea, I think we both have a responsibility
to try to address the issues.
   Yes, we have fundamental differences. I think a great many of
them have come out today. And I think if we get rid of the labels
and _ I'm not keeping count, but I think Mr. Bush has used the
label ``liberal'' at least 10 times. If I had a dollar, George, for
every time you used that label, I'd qualify for one of those tax
breaks for the rich that you want to give away.
   Isn't that the point? Most Americans believe in basic values, we
have differences about how to achieve them. I want to move forward.
I want this nation to move forward. I'm concerned about the fact
that 10 percent of our manufacturing and 20 percent of our banking
and nearly half of the real estate in the city of Los Angeles are
in the hands of foreign investors. I'm concerned about what that
does to our future. I'm concerned about the fact that so many of
our securities are in the hands of foreign banks because of these
massive deficits. But, those are the issues on which we ought to be
debating, and ...
   Q: Governor.
   Dukakis: ... if we'd just put away the flag factories and the
balloons and those kinds of things and get on to a real discussion
of these issues, I think we'll ...
   Q: Andrea.
   Dukakis: ... have a good 26 days.

   In the 1930s, before she turned to large
theatrical dances, choreographer Martha Graham rooted her work in
Indian material from the U.S. Southwest.
   At 94, she has returned to American Indians for her 178th dance
creation.
   ``Night Chant'' had its premiere Thursday night by the Martha
Graham Dance Company at the City Center.
   The music was traditional Navajo forms, arranged by R. Carlos
Nakai. Melodies, carried by what sounded like wooden flutes and
reed instruments, were beautiful and not melancholy even when the
dance led one to expect that.
   The dance is in ritual form and sustains a viewer's interest.
When a line of men or a line of women dance across the stage, they
repeat the same pattern of steps. The next time they use a
different pattern but also repeat it all the way across.
   Denise Vale was the central figure, standing at first in front
of a tall structure which looked like a metal cactus without
spikes, designed by Isamu Noguchi. She lifted a tambourine, which
she hit a few times then hung on a hook on the cactus.
   From time to time, she bowed to it as though it were the moon.
Side lighting by David Finley makes it look like moonlight. Though
none of the dancers looked Indian, the dance strongly evoked an
outdoor, nighttime American Indian scene.
   One section has four men with long poles flexing them over the
head of a fifth man. He dances and falls, injured, finally is
``killed,'' then carried out. This isn't what the entire dance
leads up to, as in ``The Rite of Spring.''
   Three couples who have danced together before dance together
again after that scene. Miss Vale is partnered briefly by Peter
London. The 20-minute dance ends with Miss Vale pounding the
tambourine with her hand.
   The evening also included Miss Graham's ``Diversion of Angels,''
``Errand into the Maze'' and ``Appalachian Spring.''

   The 100th Congress, the reluctant Congress,
isn't quite ready to go home.
   Despite growing election pressures to get home and campaign,
Congress may have to remain in town into next week to deal with the
year's hottest campaign topic _ drug abuse and the war against it.
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., delivered the bad news
to anxious-to-campaign colleagues Wednesday night. ``It is doubtful
the drug bill will be ready to be voted on before next Tuesday or
Wednesday,'' he told groaning House members at a night session.
   Over in the Senate, Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.,
tried late Wednesday night to get agreement on how to proceed with
the bill. His plan wasn't even out of his mouth before Sen. William
Armstrong, R-Colo., interrupted to say he would be ``dumbfounded''
if Byrd could get everyone to agree to any single plan of attack.

   President Reagan plans to summon Congress into
a special session to vote on renewed military aid to the Nicaraguan
Contras if he believes the Sandinista government is moving to mop
up remnants of the rebel forces.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, speaking with reporters
Wednesday evening, confirmed earlier reports by sources that Reagan
had settled on a special session as his conditional plan for
seeking new military aid for the Contras.
   Fitzwater described it as a fall-back position to ensure the
Contras' survival into the next U.S. administration, should
Nicaragua's leftist government attack the remnants of the rebel
movement in an effort to eradicate it.
   The White House spokesman acknowledged that there is no chance
to obtain further money for the rebels before the 100th Congress
adjourns. Lawmakers are eager to return home to campaign, and hope
to complete their regular session by the week's end.

   Military bases built to protect stagecoach
routes from attacking Indians or the nation's East Coast from
British gunboats may finally be closed under legislation which the
Pentagon says could save up to $5 billion a year.
   ``Congress handed, begrudgingly, the administration an axe. They
shouldn't hesitate to cut the dead wood from our domestic basing
structure,'' said Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, chief author of the
bill.
   The measure easily cleared the House and Senate on Wednesday and
was sent to President Reagan, who is expected to sign it.
   The Pentagon estimates that $2 billion to $5 billion a year can
be saved if it is permitted to pare down the list of 3,800 U.S.
military installations.

   A defense contractor agreed to a $115 million
fine in the largest Pentagon fraud settlement after admitting it
billed the Defense Department for things like babysitting, country
clubs and servants for its executives, officials said.
   In agreeing to plead guilty to defrauding the Pentagon by
overbilling for airplane parts, Sundstrand Corp. also said its
employees wined and dined Defense Department officials and then
submitted those expenses for reimbursements, U.S. prosecutors said
Wednesday.
   No company or Pentagon employee has been charged in the
overbillings, which spanned from 1980-86, but Sundstrand agreed to
cooperate with investigators, said U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas. The
investigation should be completed by January, said Valukas, who
declined to estimate how much Sundstrand's actions cost the
government.

   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping said today China and
the Soviet Union are likely to hold a summit next year, according
to diplomatic sources. It would be the first such meeting in 30
years.
   Deng, in a meeting with Finnish President Mauno Koivisto, also
expressed confidence that long-strained relations between China and
the Soviet Union will improve, sources in the Finnish delegation
said.
   China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen is to travel to Moscow
later this year to discuss the proposed summit between Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Chinese leaders, and it is
generally believed Gorbachev will visit Beijing next year.
   Deng's statement was the first by a Chinese to predict that the
summit, the first since Nikita Khrushchev came to China in 1959,
will likely take place next year.

   After a week of riots that left hundreds
dead, President Chadli Bendjedid has unveiled a series of reforms
that he says will allow Algerians to change the constitution and
bring this restless nation closer to democracy.
   Bendjedid announced the measures, including a Nov. 3 referendum
that could end the only legal political party's grip on power,
after lifting a six-day state of emergency and curfew imposed as
riots swept the country.
   Despite Wednesday's announcement, however, new reports said at
least 10 people were killed during demonstrations in Tizi-Ouzou,
the provincial capital of Kabylie, in the Berber region about 10
miles east of Algiers.
   An estimated 176 people have been slain during six days of
rioting, according to Information Minister Bachir Rouiz. But
unofficial totals set the number of dead at more than 500, with
more than 1,000 injured.

   Today is seven hundredths of a second
longer than a day in the year 1876 B.C., say scientists who studied
ancient Chinese records of solar eclipses to learn how much Earth's
rotation is slowing.
   Just as a spinning ice skater slows down by extending her arms,
Earth's rotation on its axis slows as tidal interactions make the
moon orbit Earth more quickly and become more distant from the
planet, astronomer Kevin Pang, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
said Wednesday.
   ``Four billion years ago, the moon was only one-third as far
away as it is now, and the day was only eight hours long at the
time,'' said Pang, whose study will be published soon in the
British journal Vistas in Astronomy.
   Pang and his co-authors determined that, compared to today, the
length of a day was 22 thousandths of second shorter in A.D. 532,
42 thousandths of a second shorter in 899 B.C., and 70 thousandths
of a second shorter in 1876 B.C.

      Today's highlight in history:
   In 1805, the Battle of Trafalgar took place off the coast of
Spain. A British fleet commanded by Adm. Horatio Nelson defeated a
combined French and Spanish fleet, thwarting the plans of Napoleon
I to invade England. Nelson, however, was killed.
   On this date:
   In 1797, the U.S. Navy frigate Constitution, also known as ``Old
Ironsides,'' was launched in Boston's harbor.
   In 1879, Thomas Edison invented a workable electric light at his
laboratory in Menlo Park, N.J.
   In 1917, members of the U.S. Army's 1st Division, training in
Luneville, France, became the first Americans to see action on the
front lines of World War I.
   In 1944, during World War II, U.S. troops captured Aachen, the
first large German city to fall to the Allies.
   In 1945, women in France were allowed to vote for the first time.
   In 1959, the Guggenheim Museum, designed by architect Frank
Lloyd Wright, opened to the public in New York.
   In 1960, Democrat John F. Kennedy and Republican Richard M.
Nixon clashed in their fourth and final presidential debate,
televised from New York.
   In 1966, more than 140 people, most of them children, were
killed when a coal waste landslide engulfed a school and sveral
houses in south Wales.
   In 1967, thousands of demonstrators opposed to the Vietnam war
tried to storm the Pentagon after a peaceful rally in Washington by
some 50,000 protesters.
   In 1971, President Richard M. Nixon nominated Lewis F. Powell
and William H. Rehnquist to the U.S. Supreme Court, following the
resignations of Justices Hugo L. Black and John M. Harlan.
   In 1976, Saul Bellow won the Nobel Prize for literature, the
first American so honored since John Steinbeck in 1962.
   Ten years ago: Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance arrived in
Moscow for further negotiations on the remaining points concerning
a new stratetic arms limitation treaty between the superpowers.
   Five years ago: Pentagon sources reported that 2,000 U.S.
Marines and the aircraft carrier USS Independence were heading for
Caribbean waters off the coast of Grenada to protect the lives of
Americans living there, and to provide a means of evacuation.
   A year ago: Sometimes acrimonious debate began in the U.S.Senate
on the nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork to the U.S. Supreme
Court. (Two days later, the Senate voted 58-42 to reject the
nomination.)
   Today's birthdays: Conductor Sir Georg Solti is 76. Jazz
musician Dizzy Gillespie is 71. Baseball hall-of-famer Whitey Ford
is 60. Rock singer Manfred Mann is 48. Actress Carrie Fisher is 32.
   Thought for today: ``A great deal of intelligence can be
invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is deep.'' _ Saul
Bellow.

   An ad for the staid Victoria and Albert Museum
shows a white mug behind an odd black pot from its collection.
Underneath it says: ``There's nothing wrong with modern art that a
good cup of tea won't cure.''
   The museum reports better attendance in the three months since
launching a series of flip, sometimes slangy ads such as these. The
``V&A. An ace caff (cafeteria) with quite a nice museum attached,''
they all say.
   Like other museums facing increased competition for visitors and
cash, the V and A is discovering how to sell itself.
   These citadels of art, science and history are hiring marketing
professionals, introducing admission fees and courting corporate
sponsorship _ the V and A named a gallery after Toshiba Corp. while
the Natural History Museum leases its scientists as consultants.
   For national museums, especially those with a tradition of free
admission and fat government support, the shakeup is dictated by
the entreprenurial spirit of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who
believes culture should help pay its own way.
   The private Museums Association, Britain's professional museum
body, recently devoted its annual meeting to marketing.
   ``It's a very radical reappraisal of what the museum is in
business to do,'' says Graeme Farnell, director general of the
association. ``There is some concern ... about increasing the
commercial slant. Fundamentally, it's a concern about integrity.''
   The venerable 235-year-old British Museum feels even more
strongly.
   ``There is a point where it's possible to ask the question: Have
we gone so far down a road ... that we are no longer a museum?''
says Deputy Director Jean Rankine.
   However, critics say the ad campaign is a disgrace, and that the
museum is more interested in attendance than the art experience.
   Museums say the crunch stems mainly from rising costs and
shrinking government funding.
   Under a new government system fixing grants three years in
advance, the Natural History Museum's subsidy will decline from
$36.8 million this fiscal year to $36.3 million in 1990-91.
   After the Natural History Museum's $26.6 million 1986-7 grant
left it more than $2.1 million short, it threatened to close
galleries, trim staff or charge admission. It began charging $3.40
per adult in 1987.
   The state-funded Museums and Galleries Commission, in a survey
of national museums, said the financial strain was already
noticeable in ``closed galleries, reduced security, curtailed
opening hours or days, backlogs of work, ... and less good service
to the public.''
   Competition adds to the woes, with 35 to 40 new museums opening
each year and vying for the mere 25 percent of the British who
visit museums, compared with an estimated 60 percent of the U.S.
public.
   ``It's not just museums, we're competing with all sorts of
claims on people's times,'' says Charles Mills, the recently hired
first marketing manager at the 136-year-old V and A, the nation's
eclectic museum of art and design whose exhibits range from 17th
century waistcoats to Chinese porcelain.
   After years of shutting one day a week to save money, the V and
A began asking for donations in 1985.
   Although the fee is voluntary, visitors are led through toll
booth-like gates that exert psychological pressure on them to pay.
   Some were so outraged that they wore buttons boasting, ``I
didn't pay at the V and A,'' and attendance fell by more than 40
percent in two years, from 2 million in 1985 to 1.4 million last
year.
   Attendance is recovering, and entrance fees will cover about 4
percent of the museum's estimated $24.3 million in running costs,
Mills says.
   The Natural History Museum, which hired a marketing manager this
year, has also suffered a 40 percent fall in attendance since
instituting 2-pound ($3.42) charges last year.
   The museum now sees signs of a recovery, and expects to raise
$334,000 from sales of scientific research in the next year.
   The national museums have also explored more corporate
sponsorships and social events, including the British Museum, home
of the fabled Egyptian mummy collection.
   Still, while the museum has spent $1.01 million on upgrading its
cafeteria, it draws the line at charging visitors.
   ``We are not a product to be marketed,'' says public services
director Geoffrey House.
   Neil Cossons, director of the Science Museum, warns that fear of
commercialism will ultimately hurt museums.
   ``The reluctance on the part of many museums even to contemplate
alternative frameworks of funding and management represents perhaps
the greatest threat to their integrity, the quality of their care
and the professional standing of their staffs,'' he wrote in May in
The Sunday Times.
   Cossons, who started the trend by instituting charges at the

<HEAD>Americans Richer But Giving Smaller Share To Churches</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: `empty tomb inc.' lower case, is cq</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Americans generally are richer, with more money
to spend on extras, but they're giving a smaller proportion of it
to their churches.
   That's the central finding of a broad study comparing real
income gains, adjusted for inflation and taxes, with changes in
church contributions over a 17-year period.
   ``For the first time in history,'' says researcher Sylvia
Ronsvalle, ``the majority of people in the U.S. have discretionary
income, beyond basic needs. However, church giving has not
reflected this newly available money.''
   Much of it goes into the leisure industry, which soaks up 12
percent of the average American's income, with billions spent on
cut flowers, pets, lawns and microwave popcorn, the report says.
   It's apparently difficult to convince most church members that
``meeting domestic and world needs in Jesus' name is as satisfying
as taking a beloved pet to a doggie restaurant or even buying cut
flowers,'' it says. ``However, as a starting point, we ought to be
able to portray increased stewardship as exciting as microwave
popcorn. And grow from there.''
   The study by ``empty tomb inc.,'' a non-profit research and
service organization in Champaign, Ill., under a grant from the
Lilly Endowment Inc., offers comparative data from 31 Protestant
denominations and Roman Catholicism.
   It found that Protestants in 1968 gave an average of 3.05
percent of their after-tax income to churches. That shrank to 2.79
percent by 1985.
   Nevertheless, the average per capita amount given, in terms of
constant 1982 dollars, was up from $247 in 1968 to $296 in 1985.
Among evangelical denominations, the latest per capita was slightly
more _ $306
   Among Catholics, average per capita giving declined from an
average $232 in 1963 to $151 in 1985 _ from 3.4 percent to 1.4
percent of income.
   However, disposable income increased 103 percent, or $2,511 per
capita, between 1968 and 1985, the report says. Average
contributions rose $49 per capita in that period, only 2 percent of
the new income.
   For Protestants, that meant that total contributions and per
capita giving for the 31 denominations both were up. But in view of
the greater income, the proportion given to churches was less.
   ``Although people have more money, people are not choosing to
give a larger percentage of their income to the church,'' the
report says. ``In a time when leisure industries have been born and
have expanded rapidly, the church has remained a no-growth entity.''
   Beginning with 1950, a majority of Americans have had a
dramatically increasing amount of discretionary income, the report
says, while advertising boosted demand for all sorts of extras.
   As a result, it says, ``lifestyle expectations have outdistanced
the increasing incomes,'' and church giving ``has not kept pace
with the increase in available money.''
   Yet ``church stewardship sits in the context of a world with
dire needs no longer removed from the church member. Mass
communications has brought Lazarus not only to our doorstep, but
into our living rooms.''
   To help balance the spending scales, the report suggests the
church might take a ``lesson from the successful leisure
industry,'' adding:
   ``Church programs should take a more aggressive attitude in
effectively competing for the increased discretionary dollar of
their members. Just like marketing fast food or swimming pools as
`necessities,' giving ought to be reinterpreted into that
category.''

   ``Amazing Grace'' is the most frequenly
sung hymn in Baptist churches, according to a random survey of
music directors by a Southern Baptist committee working on a new
hymnal.
   Nine of the next most frequently sung hymns in this order were:
   ``To God be the Glory,'' ``Victory in Jesus,'' ``Just As I Am,''
``Blessed Assurance, Jesus Is Mine,'' ``Standing on the Promises,''
``Living for Jesus,'' ``There is Power in the Blood,'' ``At the
Cross'' and ``At Calvary.''
   These and 190 other frequently sung hymns were recommended for
inclusion in the new hymnal to be published in 1991, a revision of
a 1975 edition.

   Although some people nowadays consider
religion irrelevant to politics, democratic values are rooted in
religion, says the head of the Knights of Columbus.
   Virgil C. Dechant, in his annual Columbus Day message, said that
``over the long pull, democratic government depends for its health
and perhaps its very survival upon values and beliefs which come
from religion.''
   Central to the Judeo-Christian belief, he said, is ``an abiding
belief in the dignity of the individual human person... God made us
all, and we are equal in his eyes.''

<HEAD>Charles Kuralt Takes To the Road in New Special</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To Charles Kuralt, the charm of being on the
road is that it's such a little deal.
   ``I just send back stories from the road about people I
admire,'' he said. ``All these years CBS has let me do what I like.
I was in a little town in Illinois where everyone has his name on a
coffee cup down at the drug store. When someone dies, the cup comes
down.
   ``Can you imagine that story being on `The CBS Evening News?'
... Nobody makes a big deal about what I do. That's the charm of
it.''
   Kuralt, who has been doing little stories for CBS since 1967, is
in good company. Charles Dickens, Rudyard Kipling and Mark Twain
all took to the road and sent back little stories.
   His latest journey into prime time is the one-hour special
``Back on the Road With Charles Kuralt,'' which CBS will telecast
Friday. It takes him from Duncan City, Ga., to Moscow _ the one in
the Soviet Union.
   With Kuralt, it's necessary to distinguish between the Soviet's
Moscow and the small-town Moscows in Idaho, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
   Kuralt was in Moscow for the Summit when a burly old man bullied
his way into his hotel and asked to speak to an American reporter.
His name was Dr. Nikita Zakaravich Asseyev, and he had been waiting
43 years to tell his story.
   ``His chest was covered with war medals and he intimidated the
KGB men guarding the hotel,'' Kuralt said. ``He told me he had been
in a German prisoner of war camp in World War II. The Russian
prisoners were starving to death until American prisoners in
another part of the camp began throwing their Red Cross food
parcels over the fence.
   ``Dr. Asseyev had never forgotten the Americans. He had their
names and he wanted to thank them for saving lives.''
   In the show, Kuralt talks to Asseyev and then looks up the
Americans that the Russian had remembered for so many years. He
found Dr. Sidney Brockman in San Diego and William Jarema, a
retired New York City police officer.
   Kuralt's travels began in October 1967 when he persuaded CBS
News to let him take a three-month trial run. He headed first for
New England, where he did a piece on the autumn leaves. That was a
revolutionary idea for the network news and gave Kuralt the courage
to do the hundreds of little stories that followed. His reports
have won two Emmys, two George Foster Peabody Awards and a
Christopher Award.
   ``It helps if you're fat and bald,'' said Kuralt. ``People look
at me and say if that guy can be on TV, so can I. It helps put
people at ease. We don't come on like a big-time television crew.
We keep it very low key. I don't even appear in many of the
stories.''
   Kuralt's cameraman is Isadore Bleckman, his soundman is Larry
Gianneschi Jr. and his co-producer is Bernard Birnbaum.
   One rule that Kuralt follows is that he never ``rides the
tricycle.''
   ``We were watching a reporter cover a tricycle race for a local
news show,'' he said. ``It was a good story until the end. The
newsman got on a tricycle and rode it. It ruined the whole story.''
   Kuralt says his trips on America's backroads have given him a
different view of the country than one would get in the seats of
power.
   ``I have a much more sanguine view than you would get from
reading the newspapers,'' he said. ``I think the country is in good
shape. I think things have changed for the better since I first
went on the road. I see candidates running for office as
environmentalists. Twenty years ago no one would have dared to call
himself an environmentalist. People are much more aware and
caring.''
   Kuralt said his family grew used to his absences during his
earlier years as a news correspondent in South America and Los
Angeles.
   ``When I was a little boy my dad had a traveling job,'' he said.
``I think that's where I got it. My mother was a school teacher and
my father was a social worker. I used to go with him on his visits
around North Carolina.''
   These days, he flies back to New York every weekend for his
duties as host of CBS' ``Sunday Morning.''

   When Marguerite Chandler, a successful
businesswoman in New Jersey, tried to persuade her community last
year to build a shelter for the homeless, she says she ``hit a
brick wall.''
   She was arguing the morality of the issue, but for the county
board, ``it was purely a political decision,'' Chandler said.
   So she set out to learn the rules of the game of politics.
   Now, she and 25 other students have earned diplomas from the
Graduate School of Political Management, the inaugural class at
what bills itself as ``the nation's first degree program in
professional politics.''
   The school's dean, Christopher Arterton, says there has been a
``tremendous commercialization of politics'' and a transfer of
power from ``party elites to people whose services can be bought.''
   And just as MBA programs sprang up to train legions of recruits
for the tough new world of business, the politics school hopes to
turn out the campaign consultants and lobbyists of the future.
   ``Why promote myths?'' says Neil Fabricant, the school's
president and principal founder. The new politics is ``something we
have to live with.''
   But does America need a graduate school devoted to teaching
future politicians and lobbyists how to conduct and read polls, how
to design and produce a TV commercial, how to raise the money?
   ``I would have given anything to learn from the pros,'' says
George Bush's campaign manager, Lee Atwater. He plans to teach at
the school in some capacity after the Nov. 8 election.
   This fall's class includes two actors, a prosthodontist and a
former member of Parliament from an eastern Caribbean island who
wants to put his degree to use back home.
   Classes are held at Baruch College in lower Manhattan, but the
school, which is chartered by the New York state Board of Regents,
is not affiliated with any institution.
   Tuition is $13,200 for the one-year, full-time program; $16,200
if you stretch it out over two years.
   The faculty consists mainly of political entrepreneurs, such as
Douglas Bailey, a onetime consultant to former President Gerald
Ford.
   Efforts are made to be non-partisan, say students and
administrators. Guest lecturers have included union leaders and
political activists from such groups as the national Right-To-Life
organization.
   Contacts the students make through the school are considered a
strong selling point. ``The networking alone would have been worth
the money,'' said Chandler.
   The school hopes make accessible to more people the ``political
technology (which) is now a condition of participating in political
life,'' Fabricant said.
   Of the 30 students in this fall's incoming class, 10 are women.
Five are black and two are Hispanic. The school advertises in
minority-oriented newspapers and offers scholarships to minority
students, Fabricant said. Most students receive some financial aid,
mainly in the form of loans.
   School officials say its goals include raising the moral level
of politics, by focusing on professional responsibility.
   ``No professional ethic ever emerges out of the profession
itself. You need a professional school, especially in this area
(because) you can't bar anyone from ... participating in
politics,'' Fabricant said. ``It can't be a licensed activity,
unlike medicine or law.''
   Still, teaching ethics can be difficult in a school for politics.
   In a recent Lobbying I class, instructor William Polf _ a
lobbyist for Columbia University _ conceded that his own profession
``really has a pretty bad name.''
   But the students in the room nodded as Polf drew a line on the
chalkboard to represent the division between special interests and
government and said: ``What any good lobbyist hopes to do is erase
this line (and) ultimately make your interests so integrated that
they think you're part of the process.''
   The New Republic attacked the school in a July cover story
titled ``The School for Sleazeballs: Training America's future
influence-peddlers, media manipulators, and political hacks.''
   ```Professionalism,''' according to the article, ``is the means
by which professionals achieve maximum income with minimum
accountability.''
   But Marty Linsky, a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy
School of Government, says ``politics has always been a mix of ...
motives.''
   Whether the school proves to have a positive or negative
influence depends on how its curriculum develops, he said. ``If the
school didn't teach them why to use (political skills) as well as
how, it would be missing part of the education,'' he said.
   The students' motives for enrolling and their future aims are as
diverse as their backgrounds.
   Chandler, 45, heads an industrial park corporation and has a
history of social involvement. She plans to continue her community
work and also possibly help a woman friend run for governor of New
Jersey next year.
   One student, who came from the University of Houston Law Center,
joined Michael Dukakis' presidential campaign as a legal adviser.
Another helped run a successful ballot campaign this year against
legalized gambling in Detroit, and still another is going to work
for a lobbying firm on behalf of nuclear power.
   ``I may run for a school board someday,'' says student Carmella
Mazzotta, 35, who as a child dreamed of being mayor of her hometown
of Utica, N.Y.
   The program gave her time, she says, to reflect on ethical
questions that she didn't have time to consider while working in
the ``real world.''
   ``I'm leaving this program (and) I'm really questioning
everything,'' she said.

<HEAD>No Tax Increases?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While Americans may never underestimate the
verbal ingenuity of politicians, they had better be prepared for
the acrobatics of taxes that aren't taxes.
   ``Tax'' is a bad word. Not only does it cost votes, but it leads
directly to other uunpleasant images, including overspending,
bureaucracy, waste, pork barrel and favoritism.
   But it is a very necessary word too, since the very candidates
for office who rail against taxes would hardly know what to do
without them, since most of their proposals involve expenditures of
some sort.
   Be prepared, therefore, for more user fees, revenue enhancers,
mandated benefits, earmarking and other techniques for squeezing
more out of the private sector without recourse to the nasty T word.
   It already is happening. Those frenzied debates over postal
rates, for instance, have been cooled by turning over the increases
to a semi-private entity, where actions are much better shielded
from public attention.
   Earmarking, or special levies on special groups for special
purposes, is likely to become common. In fact, John Hanly Adams of
the Tax Foundation suggests it will become a highly practiced art
if voters don't cry out.
   Such tax boosts often can be hidden behind the name of a
program, he says. ``Thus a tax increase on parents to finance child
care should be called an `education premium,''' he says. And
national health insurance, seriously discussed lately, could be
financed with premiums similar to those on Medicare.
   The technique of mandated benefits would shift from government
onto employers certain new services that once might have required a
tax increase. Health insurance for part-time workers and
dependents, for example.
   Revenue enhancers, already being employed, take various forms:
User fees, such as charges paid by users of Coast Guard services,
is one example.
   Another is to charge for forms used in meeting federal
regulations. The Internal Revenue Service, for instance, charges
fees for private rulings on tax questions, including computations
for individuals' retirement annuities.
   Adams cites this revenue enhancer: By tightening its procedures,
hiring more auditors, carrying more disputes to the courts, the IRS
can squeeze more dollars out of taxpayers whether tax rates go up
or not.
   The search for nontax taxes is intense and pervasive. Adams
makes this classic observation:
   ``Many tax initiatives are conceived in secrecy, drafted into
legislation without public hearings, passed with little or no
debate, and then buried in lengthy, complex legislation on other
topics such as trade rules and massive appropriations bills.''
   What do you think of this nontax tax idea now floating around
Congress: Index federal excise taxes on gasoline and other products
so they could rise automatically and without publicity.
   One of the goals of such ideas, of course, is to give the
appearance of stable taxes while simultaneously raising them. It is
a politically ingenious idea, since it gets everyone off the hook _
except the taxpayer.

<HEAD>U.S. Political Advisers Spread `Campaign Magic' to Latin America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As more Latin American nations shake
off military rule and turn to democratic government, foreign
campaign consultants, nearly all of them from the United States,
increasingly become a fixture in elections.
   Latin politicians say the advisers are most valuable for
bringing an outsider's perspective on the candidate and on what
voters want. They also provide techniques to link the candidate to
the voters' desires.
   U.S. consultant David Garth came to Venezuela in 1978 to help
presidential candidate Luis Herrera Campins. His first suggestion
was that the famously fat politician lose weight.
   Herrera, a Social Christian who felt his girth was an integral
part of his popular image, rejected Garth's advice.
   ``When you're campaigning, Venezuelans will always offer you
food and drink,'' the still-corpulent Herrera recalled recently.
``The only way you can refuse without losing a vote is to say,
somewhat mysteriously, that you're taking pills, and they'll think
you have a venereal disease or something.''
   Garth lost the battle to slim down his candidate. He chose
instead to capitalize on Herrera's communications skills in eight
memorable commercials, filmed outdoors, featuring the candidate
speaking with disgruntled citizens.
   The spots galvanized the campaign and helped Herrera defeat the
Social Democratic Party in a race that was crucial in forging
Venezuela's democracy into a two-party system.
   U.S. pollsters, media specialists and general advisers have also
helped the winning presidential campaigns of Carlos Andres Perez
and Jaime Lusinchi in Venezuela; Oscar Arias Sanchez in Costa Rica;
Nicolas Ardito Barletta in Panama; Alan Garcia in Peru and others.
   Besides Garth, these high-powered campaign consultants have
included Joseph Napolitan, David Sawyer, Matthew Reese, Robert
Squier and Sergio Bendixen.
   Sometimes, candidates ignore the advice of their hired guns from
the north at their own peril.
   In the 1987 presidential nomination race in Venezuela, Social
Democratic hopeful Octavio Lepage ignored his consultant's advice
to stay in his key government post, rather than quit to campaign in
the streets.
   Lepage, a dry party-line politician with no popular appeal, lost
the nomination to Carlos Andres Perez, a charismatic former
president who has no trouble gathering large and noisy crowds.
   But the U.S. consultants must also adapt. In Latin America, as
in Europe, political parties are much stronger than they are in the
United States, and party loyalty is the norm.
   U.S. consultants' advice can get lost in the shuffle as party
leaders struggle for influence in the campaign, which is seen as
collective rather than an individual bid.
   Latin American candidates, who are almost always men, prefer a
political message that emphasizes strength and machismo.
   While television is growing in importance as a political tool in
Latin America, the old-fashioned campaign rally, which has fallen
from favor in the United States, is still a powerful technique.
   Latin Americans have resisted using direct mail or telephone
campaign operations, mainly because these public services are
typically inefficient.
   Even so, campaigns have increasingly resembled U.S. contests,
with a variety of imported techniques.
   Mapping out a strategy, choosing one or two short messages that
are repeated as long as they are effective, polling to obtain
reliable information and relying more heavily on television are
among the principles that have filtered south.
   Now the region is developing its own advisers who are pioneering
their own techniques.
   Argentina's Felipe Noguera, for instance, an Oxford-educated
mathematician, is analyzing at what point a voter chooses a
candidate.
   Substituting Latin consultants for U.S. ones appeals to Latin
pride and saves money at the same time.
   The North Americans tend to charge Latin American clients the
same rates as U.S. candidates: perhaps $100,000 per campaign for a
general consultant, plus additional fees for specialists.
   In Venezuela's 1978 presidential election, estimates of the
candidates' spending ranged up to $120 million in all.
   In Latin America, there are no limits on campaign spending, as
there are in the United States.
   As the region has become poorer, candidates are less willing to
spend that amount for a touch of foreign ``magic,'' especially if
they can hire quality talent locally.
   But if they can afford to hire U.S. consultants, they generally
do.
   ``We began the campaign without foreign advisers and we ended it
using foreign advisers,'' said Rafael Montes de Oca, Herrera's
former campaign manager. ``They were indispensible because of their
knowledge of the media and of the techniques to find out what
people think.''

<HEAD>Scots Agonize Over `Englishing of Scotland'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scotland has suffered another blow to
its sense of separate identity: The English have overrun its
cultural establishment.
   Ever since 1707, when Scotland and England were united under one
crown and parliament, Scots have worried about being swamped by
their English neighbors, who outnumber them 11-1.
   Comes now ``The Englishing of Scotland,'' broadcast Aug. 29 on
the independent Scottish television channel, which shows the
command posts of Scottish culture firmly in the hands of Sassenachs
from south of the border.
   Not the artists, mind. Native Scottish creativity has never
looked healthier. What worries guardians of Scottish identity is
the preponderance of Englishmen in a cultural bureaucracy supposed
to be separate.
   ``The Englishing of Scottish life is a process that has gone on
for many years, but many Scots ... feel it is beginning to
undermine the very notion of Scotland,'' George Rosie, the writer
and host, said in introducing the program.
   Rosie presented impressive of evidence of ``non-Scot''
infiltration, the non-Scots being almost invariably from England.
   Non-Scots run most of Scotland's major state-subsidized arts
institutions: the National Museums, National Galleries, National
Library, Arts Council, Scottish Opera, Scottish Ballet, its three
major international arts festivals and the Scottish National Trust
for heritage parks and buildings.
   They run five of the eight universities, 10 of the 15
government-funded colleges and three of the six leading theaters.
   ``We are assimilating ourselves toward an English ideal and
gradually I think we will assimilate ourselves out of existence,''
Billy Kay, a playwright, historian and Scottish nationalist, said
on the program.
   Paul Scott, a retired diplomat, said: ``I think we're at very
grave risk of ceasing to exist as a recognizable nation, as a
recognizable culture and identity. The species is under threat.''
   While everyone saw a problem, there was little agreement on the
cause.
   Newspaper columnist Neal Ascherson said most of the institutions
mentioned were recent creations copied from England.
   ``The idea of cultural bureaucracies is entirely alien to
Scotland,'' he said. ``This is not a country which has
traditionally been kind to the arts.''
   Some said Scots were reluctant to protest ``Englishing'' for
fear of sounding racist. Alan Lawson, editor of the left-wing
journal ``Radical Scotland,'' said this fear had deprived Scots of
``the confidence to stand up and argue that there is a problem.''
   Allan Massie, a conservative writer, offered simple arithmetic:
``Because of the population ratio, if you have a job that is
publicly advertised and you have 10 applicants, you're quite likely
to find that seven of them come from outside Scotland.''
   Timothy Clifford, an Englishman who heads the National Gallery
of Scotland, called the program ``absolute arrant nonsense.''
   He said just as many Scots run English institutions, but Rosie
reported no Scots among 34 university heads in England and Wales,
and said only two of the 21 state-funded museums, art galleries and
libraries south of the border were run by Scots.
   Clifford argued that ``An Englishman sometimes understands more
and can better identify the Scottishness of something than a Scot
can.'' The program, too, paid tribute to the many non-Scots who
have fostered Scottish art forms the Scots themselves had neglected.
   Overall, however, Rosie's presentation painted a gloomy portrait
of a culture hijacked by outsiders. It inspired a deluge of
commentary and letters that complained of ``Englishing'' in
everything from soccer through architecture to the Englishisms
creeping into everyday speech in Scotland.
   The Advisory Council for the Arts in Scotland weighed in with
worry about ``the survival of Scotland as anything more than a
geographical expression.''
   Rosie said the letters ran 8-2 in support of his conclusions,
which are that ``certain jobs should be reserved for people who are
educated and brought up in Scotland and understand the nuances of
Scottish culture.''
   He acknowledges the impossibility of barring Englishmen from
jobs in Scotland since both are part of Britain, but added in an
interview: ``It's similarly daft that so many such jobs are being
taken by non-Scots. That's the ambivalence of our whole
constitutional situation.''
   The broadcast coincides with a broadly based campaign for
limited independence that is gathering support in Scotland.
   ``There does seem to be a fairly stronger feeling of nationalism
again,'' Rosie said. ``I think Scots have a pendulum consciousness
that swings from feeling British to feeling Scottish, and in my
opinion it's swinging toward Scottishness now.''

   Israel's election is focused on whether to keep
the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a buffer to hostile Arab states or
trade away the land to preserve the Jewish character of Israel.
   Israelis seem almost evenly split on the issue, and the Nov. 1
vote may be less a watershed than another shotgun wedding between
the rightist Likud bloc of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and the
left-leaning Labor Party of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
   Shamir and Peres have been reluctantly sharing power since the
1984 elections resulted in a stalemate. The unlikely coalition has
hung together despite basic policy differences.
   Interest is high in this year's election and about 80 percent of
the 2.4 million eligible voters are expected to cast ballots.
   Israel's belated debate on the future of the West Bank and Gaza,
captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, was largely sparked
by the 10-month-old Palestinian uprising in which more than 290
Palestinians and six Israelis have been killed.
   The two large parties have summoned generals out of retirement
to appear in TV ads and bolster their arguments over whether Israel
can risk yielding the territory to Arab control.
   ``The distance from Jordan to Jerusalem is about 12 miles,''
warns Likud's Yehoshua Saguy, a former head of military
intelligence.
   Standing on heights overlooking Jerusalem, Saguy points down a
road once used by Iraqi tanks. ``The message is simple: We cannot
leave these hills. This is the security of the coastal plain''
where two-thirds of Israel's 4.2 million people live.
   Maj. Gen. Ori Orr, ex-West Bank commander, is shown driving
through Nablus, the largest city in the West Bank and a focus of
the Palestinian rebellion. He suggests that controlling a hostile
population is unworkable and rejects Likud's argument that more
force is the answer.
   ``Whoever promises to end the intefadeh (Arabic for uprising)
with military means is mistaken. The solution to this problem is
political,'' he says.
   Peres supports Arab calls for an international conference on
Middle East peace, and Labor leaders have suggested they would be
willing to talk with the Palestine Liberation Organization, viewed
by Israel as a terrorist group, if the PLO abandons armed attacks
and recognizes Israel's right to exist.
   Peres argues that if Israel annexes the 2,266 square miles of
land occupied in 1967, as some right-wing politicians have
demanded, an Arab majority will emerge and destroy the Jewish
character of the country.
   Shamir's peace program rules out territorial concessions to the
Arabs, talks with the PLO or an international conference. He
advocates negotiations on the basis of the Camp David autonomy plan
embodied in Israel's peace treaty with Egypt.
   Yaakov Ezrachi of the Labor-aligned Decima Poll said voters
appear prepared to give up territory but want guarantees that it
would work.
   ``The voter is confused. He wants peace. But he doesn't believe
the Arabs,'' Ezrachi told reporters.
   Bethanie Horowitz, also of Decima, said initial reaction to the
intefadeh was a sharp swing to the right. But she predicted a
``surprise Labor victory'' because a majority has emerged which
wants to get rid of the burden of occupation.
   Mina Zemach of the Likud-hired Dahaf Poll said Likud was
expected to do well among first-time voters aged 18 to 22, about 10
percent of total voters. She said they were ``more hawkish,''
partly because of their experience as soldiers dealing with rioters.
   The polls have shown a neck-and-neck race with each party able
to win about 42 seats in the 120-seat Parliament. In 1984, Labor
won 44 and Likud won 41 seats. Twenty-eight parties are fielding
candidates and about half are likely to win a place in the
parliament.
   Likud appears to have the advantage in forming a coalition _ the
form of government that had run Israel since its founding _ because
Likud has a better rapport with the small religious parties which
are expected to get 11 or 12 seats.
   Polls are not entirely reliable because Arabs, ultra-Orthodox
Jews, kibbutz communal farmers and soldiers currently serving in
the army are not surveyed, said Rachel Yisraeli of the independent
Modiin Ezrachi poll. She said slum areas also are under-represented.
   Shamir says his party has broader appeal and a more modern
approach to the economy. He portrays Labor as speaking for European
Jews and the outmoded ideas of Israel's socialist founders.
   ``Labor represents a certain class. We care about all groups,''
he said in an interview during a campaign stop in Kfar Sava, near
Tel Aviv. ``The concept of Labor belongs to the past. It belongs to
East Europe at the beginning of the century.''
   Labor efforts appear centered on Sephardim, or Jews whose
families originated from North Africa and the Middle East. They
make up about 55 percent of Israel's 2.1 million voters and their
surge to the Likud in 1977 ended 29 years of Labor government.
   Labor strategists have defined the undecided or ``floating
voter'' as being aged 30 to 50, of Sephardic origin, with a
high-school education and above-average income.
   David Elazar, a political analyst for the Jerusalem Center for
Public Affairs, told reporters that Likud got about 70 percent of
the Sephardic vote in 1984 but would get less this time.
   Labor has been trying hard to change its image as an
establishment party dominated by Ashkenazi Jews of European origin.
   Party officials note that for the first time there is a large
Sephardic representation on the party's list of candidates with 16
Sephardim having a chance at getting into parliament.
   One Labor TV ad featured Ely Dayan, the Moroccan-born mayor of
Ashkelon who complained that roads in the Negev Desert went
unrepaired while Likud governments squandered money on developing
the West Bank.
   Peres has concentrated his personal campaign in low-income
districts with heavy concentrations of Sephardic Jews. But the
reception has often been hostile.
   On a recent walking tour of the open-air market of Ramle, 12
miles east of Tel Aviv, scores of young Sephardic Jews jostled and
booed Peres, taunting him with chants of ``go home,'' ``traitor''
and ``PLO.'' The next day Peres was sprayed with water in Beit
Shemesh, also a predominantly Sephardic area.

   Real estate mogul Donald Trump has agreed to buy
Eastern Airlines' profitable Northeast shuttle for $365 million in
cash and will rename it after himself, but if Eastern's unions get
their way the deal will collapse.

   Analysts say Eastern Airlines' decision to sell the

the sale will strengthen it.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said after the deal was announced
Wednesday that the Miami-based airline would gain badly needed cash
to pay bills while maintaining marketing relationships and route
tie-ins. Also, the shuttle would not go to an existing competitor,

   The president's ability to deal with economic problems has been

a single worldwide market, the specialists wrote in a new book,
``After Reagan: Confronting the Changed World Economy,'' unveiled

   The House Rules Committee has killed a bill
that would have pumped $5 billion into the fund that insures
deposits in the nation's 3,000 savings institutions.
   The committee decided Wednesday to indefinitely postpone floor
debate on the measure by the full House after members argued that
any attempt to bring more money into the ailing insurance fund
should wait until early next year when a study of the industry is
completed.
   With only about a week before Congress adjourns for the fall
election campaign, the action effectively blocks the bill until
next year.

   Sundstrand Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to
federal fraud charges and pay a $115 million settlement for
overbilling the Pentagon for airplane parts over five years,
federal prosecutors said.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said Wednesday the settlement
includes ``tens of millions of dollars'' in penalties against the
aerospace contractor.
   A further investigation of individuals at Sundstrand will be
completed in two or three months, Valukas said, noting the plea
agreement calls for the company to cooperate in that probe.

   A judge has issued an order temporarily
blocking Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC from acquiring an
interest in Pillsbury Co. and blocking Pillsbury from making any
moves to thwart Grand Met's $5.2 billion takeover bid.
   The temporary restraining order issued Wednesday by District
Court Judge Thomas Carey lasts until Oct. 27, when the judge will
hear further arguments in Pillsbury's lawsuit seeking to block the
unsolicited $60-a-share tender offer by the hotel and liquor
conglomerate.
   Pillsbury sued to block the offer on grounds it violates state
tied-house statutes that prevent liquor distillers from selling
liquor in retail outlets.

   Employees at Kroger headquarters say they are relieved Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co., which specializes in corporate takeovers,
withdrew its $64-a-share buyout offer on Tuesday.
   But concern about Kroger and their jobs remains, especially
because rival suitor Dart Group Corp. has not apparently withdrawn

   This year's drought-reduced corn crop is
expected to yield 4.55 billion bushels, an increase of 2 percent
from last month's estimate, the Agriculture Department reports.
   The figure disclosed Wednesday was still 36 percent below last
year's harvest, reflecting the heat and lack of rain that cut
sharply into this summer's production and still represented a
five-year low.
   Soybean production was forecast at 1.5 billion bushels, up 2
percent from September's estimate, but still 22 percent below 1987.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Climb Past $14 a Barrel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Speculation that OPEC may be moving toward an
agreement to restrain production has sent crude oil futures prices
past the $14-a-barrel mark for the first time in two weeks.
   Analysts said some late buying Wednesday was triggered by a
rumor, promptly denied by the State Department, that the U.S.
embassy in Saudi Arabia had been bombed.
   The price for the November contract for West Texas Intermediate
oil, the benchmark U.S. crude, climbed 56 cents Wednesday to settle
at $14.11 a barrel.
   In other trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 1.87 cent to
settle at 42.66 cents a gallon, while home heating oil rose 1.76
cent to 40.84 cents a gallon.
   The market has been volatile this week as crude oil prices
bounced back from last week's lows of under $12.30 a barrel.
   Reports that several members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries have been producing well in excess of their
quotas drove prices down to last week's lows.
   But prices have moved higher since then, as some traders say
signs have emerged of a more conciliatory attitude among OPEC
members.
   ``There is a growing perception that prices had gotten low
enough to force OPEC to do something,'' said Peter Beutel,
assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc. in
New York.
   Earlier this week, Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil
exporter, reaffirmed it would stick to its production quota if
other members of OPEC did.
   Beutel said the approach of the Oct. 20 meeting of the OPEC
price monitoring and long-term strategy committees was making some
traders nervous about the risks of agreements they might have
previously made to sell borrowed oil contracts in expectation that
prices would fall further.
   As speculation about production restraint grows, Beutel said,
some of those traders are buying contracts to square those
positions before the committee meetings occur.
   He said some traders also believe this weekend's meeting of the
Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes four nations that are OPEC
members, could give the OPEC members a chance to ``patch something
together'' that could be discussed at the OPEC price and strategy
committee meetings.
   Bob Baker, senior energy analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities, said prices also were supported by an American
Petroleum Institute report issued after the close of trading
Tuesday that showed crude oil and gasoline supplies fell last week.
He said many analysts were expecting rises.
   Nauman Barakat, vice president of energy investment at
Prudential Bache, said the embassy bombing rumor triggered a late
price rise because it raised concerns that terrorists could disrupt
the oil supply from the Mideast.

<HEAD>Trump's Purchase of Eastern Shuttle Faces Union, Government
Hurdles</HEAD>

   Donald Trump's deal to buy Eastern Airlines'
profitable Northeast air shuttle for $365 million in cash still
faces the hurdles of government scrutiny and a legal attack by
Eastern's unions.
   The real estate developer announced the purchase at a joint news
conference Wednesday with Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo,
who had agreed earlier to sell the three-city shuttle to Trump. The
ailing Eastern, based in Miami, is a major subsidiary of Texas Air.
   Lorenzo said the deal, under which the service between New York,
Boston and Washington would become the ``Trump Shuttle,'' is
expected to be completed by Dec. 15. He said he did not foresee any
significant legal or regulatory barriers to the sale.
   But Eastern's militant union leaders said the sale would be the
death of the airline and vowed a fight to overturn it.
   ``Our attorneys and financial consultants will be taking a very
close look at this one,'' said Jack Bavis, chairman of the pilots
union at Eastern. ``And it wouldn't surprise me if some interested
members of Congress got involved, given Lorenzo's past history of
wheeling and dealing.''
   The Eastern machinists union indicated it would to seek a
federal court order against the shuttle sale.
   In Washington, attorney Joseph Guerrieri, representing the
machinists, said he planned to file later this week a request for
the U.S. District Court in Washington to grant an injunction
against the sale.
   Earlier this year, the Eastern unions successfully blocked in
the courts Lorenzo's attempt to transfer the shuttle operation from
Eastern to a new Texas Air subsidiary for $225 million.
   Besides the new court challenge threatened by the unions, the
sale to Trump also must be approved by the Department of
Transportation, which could take from 60 to 90 days.
   The department is not expected to have any concerns about the
sale on antitrust grounds, according to a DOT official in
Washington who asked not to be identified by name.
   Trump now operates a helicopter service, Trump Air, between New
York and Atlantic City, N.J., where he owns three hotel-casinos.
The operation is too small to raise antitrust concerns if combined
with the shuttle, the official said in an interview.
   Trump still must get a new operating certificate for the shuttle
from the Federal Aviation Administration, because some of the
shuttle's personnel may be changed and the new employees may have
different training backgrounds, the DOT official said.
   The DOT also judge the new owner's fitness to operate the
shuttle, examining the managerial and technical ability of Trump
and his senior managers, Trump's financial posture and the
likelihood he will comply with safety regulations and other rules.
   But Trump ``doesn't all of a sudden have to become an airline
expert,'' said Robert Joedicke, an industry analyst for the
investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Trump said Wednesday he had named Bruce R. Nobles, who formerly
ran Pan Am Corp.'s rival shuttle service, as president of the Trump
Shuttle. Nobles has been working at Continental Airlines, the other
big Texas Air subsidiary.
   Trump and Lorenzo said the shuttle would maintain fares
competitive with the Pan Am service and would not lay off any
employees. The $365 million price tag includes landing rights at
airports in the three shuttle cities plus 17 Boeing 727s.
   The blue-silver Eastern aircraft will be redecorated and
emblazoned with red, black and gold stripes, and will carry the
word ``Trump'' on their tails.

<HEAD>Gambling Resort Hopes Trump Brings His New Jets To His Casinos</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump's purchase of the
Eastern Airlines shuttle is prompting speculation and hope among
local officials that this seaside resort _ where Trump owns three
casinos _ might be a big beneficiary of the deal.
   Trump would not say he definitely plans to use the shuttle to
bring gamblers to Atlantic City, but said Wednesday that ``it's
something that we're looking at.''
   Right now, Atlantic City gets most of its 30 million annual
visitors by car and bus, from cities several hours away.
   ``We have an airport capable of handling the Concorde,'' Gerald
Greenberg, president of the Atlantic City Hotel-Motel Association,
said Wednesday, ``and it certainly has the potential to handle
Trump's shuttle.''
   ``We need more air service to Atlantic City, more people coming
from distant markets,'' Greenberg said.
   Trump announced Wednesday he would pay $365 million in cash to
buy the shuttle from Eastern, a major subsidiary of Texas Air Corp.
   The shuttle, which will be refurbished and renamed ``The Trump
Shuttle,'' is a profitable carrier serving Boston, New York and
Washington.
   Trump said the possibility of using the fleet's 17 Boeing 727s
for shuttle service during the week and for Atlantic City junkets
on weekends was ``an interesting concept.''
   Marvin B. Roffman, an analyst with the Philadelphia investment
firm Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. said the deal ``does not revolve
around Atlantic City. He's buying the shuttle because it makes good
business sense.''
   ``But it fits into Atlantic City definitely in the next couple
of years,'' Roffman said. ``Right now there are a limited number of
hotel rooms in Atlantic City. But after Trump gets the Taj Mahal
(casino hotel) built, then he'll have 2,250 rooms in his three
hotels.
   ``So I'm sure he'd like to fly in at least 15,000 to 20,000
people a month.''
   Atlantic City Airport, located about 10 miles outside of the
city, is underused by most standards. A long-standing political
dispute among Atlantic County and community officials over control
of the airport has delayed plans for a $50 million expansion.
   In May, some progress was made when USAir began offering
regularly scheduled jet service from its Pittsburgh hub to the
airport, which has been used primarily by chartered and commuter
flights. The airline declined to give statistics on its passenger
traffic into Atlantic City.
   But before USAir, charter and commuter flights delivered just
324,000 of the city's 30 million annual visitors. By comparison,
5.8 million of the 15.2 million visitors who travel to Las Vegas,
Nev., annually arrive by plane.
   Studies indicate that if jet service had been available in
Atlantic City in 1986, 300,000 more visitors would have flown to
the resort.
   Atlantic County spokesman Michael Crowley said Wednesday that
the county would welcome seeing Trump or any other airline bring in
more flights.
   ``And our interest is not exclusively for the casino industry,''
he said. ``We're also thinking in terms of the people who live
right here, so they would be able to get air service from their
hometown airport instead of having to drive to Newark or
Philadelphia.''

<TEXT>
   Steve Jobs helped pioneer the personal
computer and then turned the industry on its head with a whole new
version of it, but the guru of new technology still must prove
himself.
   The big question Wednesday as the 33-year-old ``father'' of the
Apple II and the Macintosh unveiled his new Next computer
workstation was whether Jobs, ousted three years ago from Apple
Computer Inc., remains an enfant terrible who stumbled on fame and
fortune.
   Was he what author Lee Butcher called an ``accidental
millionaire,'' a megalomaniac who ruthlessly capitalized on others'
achievements?
   Or does he have the entrepreneurial genius capable of creating
what he calls ``insanely great'' new computer products?
   ``The whole story of his computer debut is not so much a story
in a business sense of its possible success or failure, but a part
of the whole myth-building process. The media is trying to tell the
story of what's happening to Steve Jobs,'' said Steve Wozniak, who
co-founded Apple Computer with Jobs in 1976.
   ``I hope the media can judge him for qualities other than his
folk-hero image,'' Wozniak said. ``He deserves a chance to be let
off the hook, if that's necessary.''
   Separating the myth from the fact of Jobs may be impossible.
   Jobs himself refuses to discuss the character questions that
have followed him since his much-publicized dethroning at Apple,
and says only that he is interested in the future, not the past.
   Some praise of Jobs for the Next already is coming in from those
convinced that his attempts to make developing technology available
to the widest number of consumers reflects the spirit necessary to
drive the American computer industry into the 21st century.
   ``I think the Next clearly shows that what Steve did in the past
at Apple was no fluke,'' said Jonathan Seybold, a leading Los
Angeles-based trade publisher.
   ``He is the kind of leader who gets people to achieve what they
felt they couldn't achieve,'' Seybold said.
   Jobs is touting the Next as a super personal computer that gives
ordinary people the kind of technology previously available only to
engineers.
   But because he has allowed only limited trial use of the
machine, neither the industry nor the marketplace has decided with
any finality whether his claim is hype or reality.
   Unless he proves the Next offers another revolutionary step in
computers, Jobs could join the ranks of other industry pioneers
whose latest endeavors have failed to have much impact.
   Public perceptions of Jobs may have changed since he was at
Apple. In his book, ``Accidental Millionaire,'' Butcher has
described him as a moody, tyrannical, abrasive and arrogant boss,
contrary to the widespread public perception of him as an amiable,
somewhat eccentric, collegial researcher.
   John Sculley, the former president of the Pepsi-Cola division of
PepsiCo, came to Apple in 1983 as its chief executive officer and
gave Jobs ``greater power than he ever had and I had created a
monster,'' he wrote in last year's best-selling ``Odyssey: Pepsi to
Apple...''
   Both Butcher and Sculley have contended that Jobs, during his
tenure as head of Apple's Macintosh division, almost destroyed
Apple by ignoring the opinions of others, berating employees and
insinuating himself into every decision.
   Both describe him as charismatic, but claim he was lucky, not
talented, when it came to his past business successes.

<HEAD>Court Jousting Continues Between Pillsbury, Grand Metropolitan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A court order temporarily blocking Grand
Metropolitan PLC from acquiring any interest in Pillsbury Co. also
blocks Pillsbury from making moves that could thwart Grand Met's
$5.2 billion takeover bid.
   The temporary restraining order issued Wednesday by Hennepin
County District Court Judge Thomas Carey lasts until Oct. 27, when
the judge will hear further arguments in Pillsbury's lawsuit
seeking to block the unsolicited $60-a-share tender offer by the
British liquor and hotel conglomerate.
   The order temporarily enjoins Grand Metropolitan from acquiring
any interest in Pillsbury, while barring Pillsbury from taking any
action to alter the status quo before the Oct. 27 hearing.
   The judge also scheduled a hearing today to finalize terms of
the order.
   Pillsbury sued to block the tender offer on grounds it violates
state tied-house statutes that prevent liquor distillers from
selling liquor in retail outlets. Pillsbury's retail liquor outlets
include the full-service restaurant chains of Steak & Ale and
Bennigans.
   Pillsbury closed up 12{ cents at $56.87{ a share Wednesday on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   The Minneapolis-based food and restaurant company is fighting
the takeover attempt but has not officially responded to the bid.
Pillsbury must reject or accept the offer by Oct. 19 to conform to
federal securities laws, said Johnny Thompson, vice president of
public relations for Pillsbury.
   Thompson said the order, among other things, would temporarily
prevent Pillsbury from such actions as making major acquisitions.
   Allen Finkelson, chief counsel for Grand Metropolitan, said
Carey's ruling was important because it blocks Pillsbury from
taking action that could thwart the deal.
   But he also said the order could slow the pace at which market
professionals buy Pillsbury stock for the purposes of tendering it
to Grand Met, which would lower the stock price and decrease the
momentum of the takeover bid.
   ``People will become less sure that the offer will become
sucessful so they don't buy the stock,'' Finkelson, said.
   He added that the full impact of the judge's ruling would not be
known until it is finalized.
   Finkelson said Grand Metropolitan already is prohibited by
federal securities law buying Pillsbury shares until its tender
offer expires on Nov. 1. The offer could be extended.
   Larry Haeg, a Pillsbury spokesman, said Carey's ruling
temporarily maintains the status quo in the relationship between
Pillsbury and Grand Metropolitan as litigation in 13 other states
related to the tied-house statutes continues. Grand Metropolitan is
seeking waivers from the laws, saying it will immediately sell
Pillsbury's liquor retail outlets if the takeover succeeds.
   Pillsbury had obtained restraining orders in eight states
blocking Grand Metropolitan from acquiring Pillsbury stock, but the
restraining orders have dissolved in four of those states,
spokesmen for the two companies said.
   Separately, Grand Metropolitan issued a news release late
Wednesday, saying Minnesota Commerce Commissioner Michael Hatch has
ruled that the tender offer meets disclosure requirements under the
state's anti-takeover law.
   Under the law, Hatch has the power to suspend tender offers if
he determines Minnesota shareholders are not provided with enough
information about the deal.

<HEAD>Tyson Must Sweeten Pot To Buy Holly Farms, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tyson Foods Inc. may have to sweeten its
$891 million buyout offer before Memphis-based Holly Farms Corp.
gives in to the bid from its rival poultry processor.
   Holly Farms officials on Wednesday would say only that they were
considering Tyson's offer of $45 cash and a quarter share of its
Class A common stock for each of Holly Farms' 18.1 million
outstanding shares.
   Tyson, of Springdale, Ark., is the nation's largest poultry
processor. A Holly Farms buyout would increase Tyson's market share
from 18 percent to 28 percent, analysts said.
   ``I think Holly Farms will sell to Tyson only as a last
resort,'' said John M. McMillin, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities in New York.
   McMillin said he valued Holly Farms at $55 a share or more. He
said the Tyson offer amounts to about $49.25 a share.
   ``If Tyson wants to buy the company he's going to have to pay
$55,'' McMillin said.
   Holly Farms stock rose sharply in heavy trading, jumping $6.62{
a share to $49.62{ in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
Tyson fell 62{ cents a share to $17 in over-the-counter trading.
   Based on Wednesday's closing price, Tyson's offer would be worth
$49.25 a share, or about $891.4 million.
   Holly Farms officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday
night.
   McMillin also speculated Holly Farms alternatively would pursue
a leveraged buyout by managers who will seek to take the company
private.
   ``There's a couple of options,'' McMillin said. ``One is to look
for a white knight, which could potentially be a Phillip Morris or
a Sara Lee...look for a company to basically choose who they want
to get married to.
   ``The other is to pursue a management-led leveraged buyout, take
the company private. I think that's what they're pursuing right
now,'' McMillin said.
   John Lawrence, an associate analyst for Morgan Keegan in
Memphis, said he believes Holly Farms could be bought out by Tyson
at a price in the range of $50 to $55 a share.
   Hours before Tyson announced its offer late Tuesday, Holly Farms
announced it had been approached by an unidentified company
regarding a possible business combination. Holly Farms said no
specific proposal had been received and the company did not intend
to seek one.
   The company also said it had activated a shareholder rights
plan, commonly known as a ``poison pill'' takeover defense, aimed
at making a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive.
   ``We haven't heard a word. We are just waiting on whatever
decision they are making over there. We are standing by,'' Bob
Justice of Tyson Foods said Wednesday. ``We do have a timetable of
Oct. 19. That's our deadline. Hopefully, they can make a decision
prior to that. And we feel optimistic about a response before
that.''
   Officials of the two companies met four weeks ago in Memphis.
Tyson asked for access to nonpublic corporate information from
Holly Farms to help determine whether a higher offer was warranted.
   Tyson, which posted sales of about $1.8 billion last year,
produces 14 million pounds of chicken meat each week from an
operation that includes hatcheries, feed mills, processing plants
and a sophisticated marketing arm. The company sells both whole
chickens and ``value enhanced products'' to supermarkets, fast food
chains and institutional customers.
   Holly Farms is a diversified foods company, with about 50
percent of its sales concentrated in chicken. The company, which
also mills flour and provides other meats for the food service
industry, had sales of about $1.6 billion last year.

   Some union leaders and analysts see Eastern
Airlines' sale of its profitable Northeast shuttle to real estate
developer Donald Trump as a big step away from independence.
   But an Eastern spokesman says the company will get a good price
for the shuttle, bringing essential cash to keep Eastern viable.
   ``There's no question that within the Eastern structure, the
shuttle is certainly the crown jewel,'' Robert Joedicke, airline
analyst for Shearson Lehman in New York, said Wednesday.
``Obviously, they've been having difficulties at Eastern and if you
take out a highly profitable facet, it certainly makes it much
harder to survive.''
   Robert V. Callahan, former head of the Eastern flight attendants
union, was more blunt about the $365 million sale announced
Wednesday by Trump and Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent
Texas Air Corp.
   ``If it clears all the legal hurdles, it signals the end of
Eastern Airlines as an independent entity,'' he said, referring to
plans by Eastern's unions to try to block the sale in the courts.
   ``The proposed sale simply confirms what we have been saying all
along,'' said Jack Bavis, chairman of the Air Line Pilots
Association local. ``Mr. Lorenzo is only intent on gutting
Eastern...not in trying to make it fly.''
   Bavis said he believes the shuttle sale is part of an ultimate
plan of merging Eastern into Texas Air's Continental Airlines, a
non-union carrier.
   But Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the deal ``absolutely
does not mean the end of Eastern.''
   ``If anything, it strengthens Eastern enormously,'' he said.
   Matell said Eastern would get badly needed cash for paying its
bills while maintaining marketing relationships and route tie-ins.
Also, the shuttle linking New York, Washington and Boston would not
go to an existing competitor, he said.
   The shuttle has been Eastern's most profitable operation. But
Matell said it provides only about 4 percent of Eastern's total
revenue and therefore should not be considered crucial to its
survival.
   He said Eastern would have preferred to keep the shuttle but was
prevented by ``the reality of our economics.''
   Eastern's unions, which have opposed major cost-cutting moves,
vowed to fight the sale. They got the courts to block Texas Air's
attempt in February to spin the shuttle off into a new subsidiary,
and Lorenzo later dropped the plan.
   ``I don't think anyone should consider this a done deal,'' Ron
Cole, ALPA spokesman said of the sale to Trump. ``...We've been
fighting the loss of any Eastern assets and we're going to keep
fighting.''
   The agreement with Trump came amid reports Lorenzo also has been
discussing the possible sale of the rest of Eastern to Carl Icahn,
chairman of Trans World Airlines. Union sources reported Icahn had
talked with Eastern labor representatives about making salary
concessions.
   Joedicke, the airline analyst, said a combination of TWA and
Eastern would make good competitive sense, because Eastern's
strengths in north-south routes on the East Coast and in the
Caribbean and Latin America would complement TWA's routes.
   Eastern unions have opposed Texas Air's takeover of Eastern
since it was announced in February 1986. Dozens of lawsuits still
are pending in the courts, and the Eastern Machinists union has
been in federal mediation over a new contract since January.
   Texas Air's management, pointing to Eastern's $2.5 billion debt
and $1 billion in losses over the past decade, says the unions must
cut labor costs by up to 30 percent.
   Last year, Eastern's computer reservations system was made into
a separate Texas Air unit for $100 million to Eastern, which pays
some $10 million a month now to Texas Air to use the system,
according to court testimony. Eastern also has paid Texas Air tens
of millions of dollars in management fees and other costs.

   Walgreen Co. ``will not be distracted'' from its
aggressive growth plans by the Haft family's bid to acquire a stake
in the nation's largest drugstore chain, says Chairman Charles R
Walgreen III.
   The Hafts, who already are bidding on the food retailer Kroger
Co., have applied for federal clearance to buy at least $15 million
of the drug retailer's stock, Walgreen said.
   The disclosure came Wednesday as Walgreen reported a 22 percent
increase in its fourth-quarter net income and a 25 percent profit
gain during the company's 1988 fiscal year.
   Walgreen stock rose $1.25 to $35.25 a share in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Wednesday.
   Based on that closing price and Walgreen's roughly 61.5 million
outstanding shares, a $15 million investment would give the Hafts a
stake of about six-tenths of 1 percent in Walgreen.
   The Hafts, who control Dart Group Corp., have a reputation as
corporate raiders who buy large amounts of stock in companies they
have ostensibly targeted for takeover and later sell their shares
back to those companies or other suitors at a hefty profit.
   Neither the Hafts nor Landover, Md.-based Dart would comment on
their plans regarding Walgreen, which operates more than 1,400
stores in 29 states.
   Walgreen, the company's chairman, said the Deerfield, Ill.-based
chain would ``take all actions necessary to protect the company and
its shareholders.''
   ``Walgreen Co. intends to continue the course on which its
success has been built _ concentrating on our core business,
growing that business carefully through a program of planned
expansion and providing our customers with high quality products
and service,'' the chairman said in a statement.
   ``We will not be distracted from that course.''
   The Walgreen chain has grown by 562 stores in the past five
years. The company said it plans to open another 100 stores in
fiscal 1989.
   The Hafts sold their 77-store Dart discount drugstore chain in
1984 for $160 million and have said they intend to acquire another
retailing company.
   Despite apparent attempts to acquire such chains as Federated
Department Stores Inc., May Department Stores Co., Supermarkets
General Corp., Dayton Hudson Corp., the Hafts have yet to complete
a takeover.
   The Hafts have also indicated interest recently in F.W.
Woolworth Co. and Zayre Corp., but have not made bids for those
retailers.
   Last month, Dart chairman Herbert Haft and his son, company
president Robert Haft, offered to buy Kroger for about $4.32
billion. The status of the bid was in doubt after the New York
investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc. withdrew a $5.03
billion offer for Kroger.
   The Hafts offered last week to help Kroger fight the Kohlberg
bid by proposing to provide additional equity for Kroger's
previously-announced restructuring.
   Robert Haft reiterated that offer Tuesday, but declined to
comment on whether the Dart offer for Kroger has been withdrawn.
   Walgreen reported net income of $31.9 million, or 52 cents a
share, on sales of $1.2 billion for the three months ended Aug. 31.
   For the year ended Aug. 31, Walgreen reported net income of
$129.1 million, or $2.10 a share, on sales of $4.9 billion.

<HEAD>Disney-owned Firm Increases Pressure Against Polaroid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shamrock Holdings Inc. has increased the
pressure in its attempt to acquire Polaroid Corp., charging with
full-page newspaper advertisements that the instant camera pioneer
is fanning ``fear and concern'' among its employees.
   The ads in two Boston newspapers follow a sharp exchange between
the presidents of the two companies, in which Polaroid rejected
Shamrock's request to meet with stockholders about its $42-a-share
buyout offer.
   Also Wednesday, a federal court in Delaware held a hearing over
Polaroid's lawsuit seeking to block Shamrock from acquiring any
additional shares of the company.
   Shamrock, a Burbank, Calif.-based television and radio concern
owned by the Roy E. Disney family, was rebuffed in an unsolicited
takeover bid before making a sweetened hostile offer last month
valuing Polaroid at $2.6 billion.
   Its latest offensive came in an ad titled ``Why Is Polaroid's
President Afraid To Allow Shamrock To Meet With Polaroid
Employees?'' in the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald.
   The ad appeared one day after Polaroid President I. MacAllister
Booth rebuffed a request by his Shamrock counterpart, Stanley P.
Gold, to meet with Polaroid employees to discuss the takeover bid.
   Booth responded that Polaroid does not ``as a matter of
long-standing policy, put outside speakers in touch with our
employees.''
   Gold countered in the ad directed at Polaroid employees: ``We
believe you have the right to hear directly from us as to what we
have in mind for employees once our acquisition of Polaroid is
completed. Mr. Booth is attempting to create fear and concern among
Polaroid's work force.''
   Gold told workers they ``have nothing to fear'' if Shamrock
acquires Polaroid.
   At issue is Polaroid's employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP,
which places 14 percent of company stock in employee hands.
Shamrock has refused to recognize the ESOP and is suing Polaroid in
Delaware's Court of Chancery to block it. Hearings are to begin
next week.
   But Polaroid's Employees' Committee told its 9,700 U.S. workers
they would meet with Gold only if Shamrock drops the lawsuit and
acknowledges employees as the largest stockholders.
   ``The only reason he wants to meet with the employees is to
convince us what a great guy he is, so if he loses the suit he can
solicit our votes,'' committee chairman Nick Pasquarosa said.
``We'd be willing to meet with him but he has to show some good
faith.''
   Gold's ad said Shamrock was committed to restoring pay cuts
imposed on Polaroid employees to fund ``management's ill-conceived
attempt to protect its position by sticking 14 percent of
Polaroid's stock in a leveraged ESOP.''
   Employees are paying for the shares with a 5 percent pay cut.
Polaroid had to borrow $285 million to fund the $300 million ESOP.
   Shamrock also criticized Polaroid's ongoing restructuring that
includes layoffs and what it called ``exaggerated promises for new
products and diversification efforts.''
   If it acquires Polaroid, Shamrock has said it would drop
Polaroid's fledgling venture into 35mm film, sell most of the
company's undeveloped real property, narrow its manufacturing
facilities, and limit research and development to Polaroid's core
businesses.
   Analysts said the court case over the ESOP would be the major
determining factor in the takeover battle.
   In U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., Polaroid asked Judge
Caleb Wright to issue a temporary injunction against the
``manipulative, deceptive and materially false'' tender offer. The
injunction seeks to stop Shamrock from acquiring additional shares
of Polaroid and compel it to divest its current 5 million shares.
   Attorneys for Polaroid maintained Shamrock violated securities
laws because its offer was not extended to all valid shares, and
did not include its investment bankers, Wertheim, Schroder & Co.
and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., as co-bidders.
   Polaroid attorney Paul Saunders said the investment houses would
obtain $100 million in stock, or 21 percent control of Polaroid,
for $46 million.
   But Shamrock lawyer Pamela Jarvis said the investment bankers
only brought the deal to Shamrock's attention and the 21 percent
stake was part of a fee arrangement.

<HEAD>Dollar Drops For Third Straight Day, Stocks Also Lower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar dropped today for the third straight
trading day because of what dealers said was uncertainty over the
U.S economy. Stocks were also lower.
   After opening at 127.90 yen, down from Wednesday's close of
129.65, the dollar moved between 127.75 yen and 128.35 yen. It
closed at 127.98 yen, down 1.67 yen. It fell a total of 3.85 yen
Tuesday and Wednesday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's main index, lost 136.07 points, or 0.50 percent, closing
at 27,273.30.
   Dealers said the markets declined because dealers believed the
U.S. economy is slowing and were wary of U.S. trade figures
scheduled for release today in Washington. They also said the
sudden decline of the dollar in Tokyo reflected its overnight fall
in London and New York.
   ``The market appears to be overreacting a bit, but there were
various elements since last week that could push the dollar down,''
said Toshikazu Kotoge, a dealer at Yasuda Trust Bank.
   He cited the lower-than-expected U.S. employment rate of 5.4
percent released last week and a growing feeling the U.S. trade
deficit is worsening.
   ``My impression is that (the yen's) appreciation was somewhat
too steep,'' Japan's Kyodo News Service quoted Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa as saying. ``If the fluctuation is too wide for one
day, it better be tamed down.''
   But dealers said it was unlikely the dollar would dip below the
125-yen level as traders were likely to start buying at that rate.
   The dollar's closing today was the lowest since June 22, when it
closed at 127.60 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, dealers said uncertainty in the
foreign exchange market made investors already nervous over the
upcoming U.S. trade figures even more wary.
   ``Most export-oriented shares are down, reflecting the yen's
sudden appreciation,'' said Ichitaro Watanabe of Nikko Securities
Co. ``Only very few shares ... are gaining. But the market as a
whole was very quiet as expected ahead of the release of U.S. trade
figures.''
   The volume traded on the first section of the exchange, where
most major shares are listed, was a light 400 million shares.
   Also, dealers attributed the market slump to Emperor Hirohito's
poor health. Since he became bedridden Sept. 19, the Nikkei has
lost 456.99 points, or 1.6 percent.
   ``There is no clear logic to the relation between the emperor's
illness and the market,'' said Jeff Bahrenburg, an economist at
Merrill Lynch. ``But at least I can say a situation like this
creates uncertainties, and that one of the things market doesn't
like most.''

   The semiconductor industry's most
closely watched indicator fell to its lowest point in 22 months in
September, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.
   The book-to-bill ratio stood at 0.97, meaning that for every
$100 worth of products shipped manufacturers obtained $97 in new
orders.
   The last time new orders fell below shipments was in November
1986 when the industry was pulling out of a slump.
   Mel Phelps, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist, said customers
are using up inventories rather than buying new chips.
   ``I think that what we are experiencing is a rather rapid
dissipation of inventory,'' he said Wednesday.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Rises 4.3 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Falling oil prices helped boost Japan's trade
surplus to $7.742 billion in September, an increase of 4.3 percent
from a year earlier and a massive 56.9 percent rise from August,
the Finance Ministry announced Thursday.
   But Japan's trade surplus with the United States declined,
falling to $4.648 billion from $4.860 billion in September 1987,
the government said.
   Japan's exports during September rose 13.6 percent from a year
earlier to $23.118 billion, while imports increased 18.9 percent to
$15.376 billion, the ministry said.
   In August, Japan's trade surplus registered $4.935 billion,
while in September 1987 it was $7.424 billion.
   After declining for 15 months from year-earlier levels, the
country's trade surplus reversed direction in July, causing concern
among officials that a resurge in the imbalance could result in
increased trade friction.
   But ministry officials said it was too early to determine
whether the increases would continue.
   ``We think it's going to go up and down for a while,'' said a
ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``But there
are too many imponderables, like how exchange rates and oil prices
will move.''
   The officials said the value of imports had been held down by
declining world oil prices. Crude imports fell 29.9 percent in
value in September from a year earlier to $1.166 billion, the
ministry said.
   In the past several months, the U.S. dollar has been stable
against the yen, reportedly helping to drive up Japanese exports.
But this week, the yen began rising rapidly, potentially making
Japanese products more expensive and therefore less competitive
overseas.
   If oil prices remain low, the officials said, imports likely
will stay down, resulting in larger trade surpluses.
   ``But if the yen goes up against the dollar, that would curb
exports and increase imports,'' one official said. ``So a lot
depends on how those things will change in the future.''
   Manufactured goods accounted for 51.5 percent of all imports
during the month, surpassing the 50 percent mark for the first time
and reflecting the decrease in oil imports, the ministry said. The
previous high was 49.9 percent in April.
   Exports to the United States rose 6.6 percent from a year
earlier to $8.097 billion, while imports from the United States
surged 26.2 percent to $3.448 billion, the ministry said. It was
the ninth month in a row that the bilateral surplus has fallen from
year-earlier levels.
   Exports to the European Community increased 16.6 percent to
$3.895 billion, while imports grew 29.9 percent to $1.881 billion,
yielding a trade surplus of $2.014 billion, compared to $1.891
billion in September 1987, the ministry said.
   Japan's surplus with Southeast Asia also increased to $1.834
billion from $1.103 billion a year earlier, it said.
   Japan measures its trade on a customs-clearance basis, which
includes freight and insurance costs on imports but not in exports.
Its trade surplus would be higher if those costs were included in
both categories.

<HEAD>OPEC Chairman Says Perhaps More Than One Meeting Is Needed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto, one name, is cq.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said Thursday he
was confident the oil cartel would be able to stabilize oil prices
but that it might take more than one meeting of its members.
   Subroto, speaking at an oil conference here, also said success
depended on unequivocal support for the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries from non-OPEC oil producers.
   OPEC's price monitoring committee and its long-term strategy
committee are to meet in Madrid Oct. 20. The cartel is to hold a
full meeting in Vienna in late November.
   ``It is not an easy task and maybe one or more meetings (after
the Madrid meeting) are necessary to reach a final production and
pricing strategy,'' Subroto said.
   ``Clearly, the present level of oil prices is unacceptable,''
Subroto said. ``OPEC is determined to restore oil prices as soon as
possible to the $18-a-barrel level.''
   Oil prices now range $6 to $8 below that OPEC target price.
   Current OPEC production of about 20 million barrels a day is
``an unnatural level,'' the chairman said, adding, ``We are going
to bring it back to the level we agreed to.''
   All OPEC nations except Iraq agreed in June to continue to limit
their production to 15.06 million barrels a day until the end of
the year, but several cartel members are exceeding their individual
output quotas.
   ``We are confident that we will be able to resolve these
problems and to formulate a long-term stategy on oil prices and
production,'' Subroto said.
   Subroto said his optimism was based on recent consultations with
various OPEC nations and on the end of hostilities in the Persian
Gulf.
   ``There is almost a consensus that unless something is done,
prices would continue to slide down. We are more aware now than at
any other time of the gravity and dangers of the current
situation.''
   However, he added, that the prospect of achieving oil price
stability ``remains somewhat bleak'' as long as non-OPEC producers
are indifferent toward OPEC.
   ``What the oil industry urgently needs is a broader based
dialogue between OPEC and all other OPEC oil producers,'' he said.
   Overproduction by OPEC is not the only factor pressuring prices,
Subroto said, saying non-OPEC producers, which include the Soviet
Union, United States and Britain, are producing as much as they can.
   He accused the non-OPEC producers of enjoying the benefits of
the cartel's efforts without having to ``endure any of the
sacrifices.''
   The oil conference at which Subroto spoke was sponsored by the
International Herald Tribune and the Oil Daily.

<HEAD>Japanese Stock Speculator Files For bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A real estate firm noted for massive stock
speculation filed for bankruptcy Thursday, citing debts equivalent
to $1.2 billion, a court official said.
   The company, Nippon Tochi, asked the Osaka District Court for
protection from 256 creditors, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The court will review the company's financial situation and
attempt to help it pay off at much of its debts as possible.
   Nippon Tochi's petition, which declared 156 billion yen in
liabilities, was the third largest bankruptcy filing in Japanese
history.
   Security analysists said Nippon Tochi began buying large chunks
of Konika Co. stock last year and had acquired more than 20 percent
of the photo equipment and film manufacturing firm before the stock
began declining recently.
   The analysts also said real estate firms have faced severe
financial problems in recent months because government restrictions
last year drove down the price of land and made it hard for
companies to repay bank loans.
   ``Speculators could borrow money from banks and financial
institutions almost endlessly when the land price was still
rising,'' said one analyst, who spoke anonymously. ``But many of
them are suffering badly now that their credit was decreasing and
they are faced with a huge repayments with no extra money to
invest.''
   Said private securities analyst Kazuo Kitada: ``It is becoming
increasingly more difficult for land speculators to get money to
invest in the stock market because of tighter control on land
speculation and tighter securities law.''
   ``In the long run, it (Nippon Tochi's bankruptcy) is good for
the market'' because it will send a signal to other speculators,
Kitada said.
   Sanko Shipping Co. declared bankruptcy in August 1985 with debts
of 520 billion yen, then worth about $2.2 billion. Toyota Shoji
filed for bankruptcy in February 1985 with debts of 200 billion
yen, or about $844 million under exchange rates at the time.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar sank today in Europe after the
U.S. government reported a larger-than-expected widening in the
U.S. trade deficit.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   The dollar, which had dropped during the morning, fell further
after the Commerce Department reported the U.S. merchandise trade
deficit swelled to $12.18 billion in August from $9.47 billion in
July.
   Traders had expected the deficit to widen to between $11 billion
and $12 billion.
   In addition to concern over the trade report, the upcoming U.S.
presidential election also was creating uncertainty in the market,
traders said earlier.
   ``We don't know whether the new president will talk the dollar
up or down,'' said a dealer at a European bank in Frankfurt.
   In London, the dollar plummeted a cent against the British pound
after the report was issued. It cost $1.7465 to buy one pound after
the report, compared with $1.7305 late Wednesday.
   Other dollar rates after the report was released, compared with
late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.8175 West German marks, down
from 1.8340; 1.5350 Swiss francs, down from 1.5587; 6.2150 French
francs, down from 6.2770; 2.0515 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0760;
1,356.60 Italian lire, down from 1,379.00; and 1.2093 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2118.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar plunged for the third straight trading day because of
what dealers said was uncertainty about the U.S. economy. The
dollar closed at 127.98 yen, down 1.67 yen. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 127.00 yen after the trade report.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $409 an ounce, down from
$409.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $408.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $408.60, up from $408.10 bid late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.69 to close at a bid $411.22.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.32 an ounce,
down from Wednesday's $6.35.

   The stock market was mixed today, riding out the
news of a wider-than-expected U.S. trade deficit in August.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.36 to 2,134.60 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 404 up, 450 down and 487
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.27 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Before the market opened the Commerce Department reported that
the trade deficit expanded to $12.18 billion in August from $9.47
billion the month before.
   The latest figure slightly exceeded advance estimates on Wall
Street, and send the dollar briefly tumbling in foreign exchange.
But the dollar sson rebounded.
   Analysts said the stock market appeared to have taken the news
largely into account with its decline on Wednesday.
   Today's activity came as a sharp contrast to the release of the
August trade report a year ago, which prompted a 95-point drop in
the Dow Jones industrial average just a few days before Black
Monday on Oct. 19.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose 1\ to 118}; General Electric gained \ to 43\, and
American Telephone & Telegraph was unchanged at 26{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.45 to 155.22. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 30.23 points
to 2,126.24.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 3 to 1 on the

million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Panel's Action Effectively Kills Action On FSLIC Bill</HEAD>

   A senior member of the House Banking Committee
says savings industry lobbyists seeking a taxpayer bailout killed a
bill that would have pumped $5 billion of industry money into the
ailing Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
   Legislation to expand the insurance fund's borrowing limit from
$10.8 billion in bonds to $15.8 billion was strongly opposed by
lobbyists for the industry, which is paying an extra assessment to
retire the 30-year bonds.
   By indefinitely postponing debate, the House Rules Committee on
Wednesday effectively blocked the measure until next year.
   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., the sponsor of the bill, had argued
it is better for government regulators to obtain money through
bonds paid off by the industry than to rely more heavily on
promissory notes, which could eventually have to be paid by the
taxpayers.
   ``I think the industry killed the bill. I think the U.S. League
(of Savings Institutions) killed the bill because they want the
taxpayers to bail out the industry. They do not want to engage in
any self help. This has been their plan from Day One,'' LaFalce
said Wednesday in a telephone interview.
   ``The public is unaware of what's been going on. There's no
other lobby group but the industry itself and the industry says,
`Let someone else solve the problem','' he said.
   Mark Clark, senior vice president of the U.S. League, the
largest S&L trade group, said the House panel's action was
appropriate. He said legislators should fashion a comprehensive
solution to the S&L financial crisis next year rather than
hurriedly pass a piecemeal bill this fall.
   Congress expects to adjourn for the year this week or next.
   Clark said healthy S&Ls have already paid about $4 billion more
than the normal assessment for deposit insurance. He said the extra
payments so far this year caused 69 solvent institutions to lose
money.
   In related action, the full House refused to abolish a
much-criticized federal agency created to manage and sell off
property and other assets from failed S&Ls.
   The House voted 247-130 to abolish the Federal Asset Disposition
Association, but the measure failed because it fell five votes
short of a needed two-thirds majority.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's
3,000 S&Ls, created FADA in 1985 as a quasi-public agency with its
own board of directors made up of industry representatives.
   Lawmakers have accused FADA of mismanagement, favoritism,
conflicts of interest and of lavish spending on salaries as high as
$250,000 a year. The House Banking Committee on Oct. 4 voted 42-8
to transfer its duties back to the S&L insurance fund. The eight
committee Republicans opposing the bill charged it was politically
motivated.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls On Report Of Wider Trade Deficit</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts 1 graf after lede with stock market action; SUBS last

<TEXT>
   The dollar sank today and interest rates rose
after the government reported a jump in the nation's trade deficit
to $12.2 billion.
   The stock market defied pessimism, though. Prices were mixed in
early trading and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was
6.03 points higher at 2,132.29 an hour after the New York Stock
Exchange opening.
   A record level of American exports was swamped by an all-time
high in imports, the Commerce Department announced. The imbalance
between what the United States imports and what it sells abroad
climbed by $2.7 billion over a July deficit of $9.5 billion.
   The July figure had been the smallest monthly imbalance in more
than three years. Economists had expected an increase for August,
but the actual result was worse than the $11.3 billion imbalance
many forecasters had predicted.
   From the point of view of inflation-wary investors, the
combination of strong exports and strong imports was ``probably the
worst combination you could get'' because it signals possible
overheating of the economy, said Michael Moran, chief economist of
Daiwa Securities America Inc.
   Even before the figures were released, financial markets headed
lower because of unease over what the government would report. The
Dow Jones industrial average fell by 30.23 points on Wednesday, its
biggest decline in nearly two months.
   The dollar's decline was not huge because the dollar had already
fallen steadily this week in response to investors' fears of a bad
trade number.
   A big deficit increases the likelihood that the dollar will need
to decline to make American goods cheaper in world markets.
   Moments after the release of trade figures at 8:30 a.m. EDT, the
dollar fell to just above 126 Japanese yen and less than 1.82 West
German marks. But traders had second thoughts and the currency
recovered part of its lost ground.
   Two hours after the trade figures' release, the dollar was
traded at a little over 127 yen and under 1.82 marks, down from
more than 129 yen and 1.83 marks Wednesday. The dollar has now
retreated to its levels of late June and early July.
   Long-term interest rates rose. That reflected investors'
concerns about inflation and a declining dollar, which would prompt
investors to switch money from dollars into other currencies.
   The yield on the Treasury's 30-year Treasury bond, a key measure
of long-term rates, rose to 8.95 percent from 8.90 percent late
Wednesday. That reflected a decline in its price as inflation-wary
bondholders sold the securities.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unemployment in Britain fell to a seasonally
adjusted 8 percent of the workforce in September from a revised 8.1
percent in August, the government said Thursday.
   The figure was down from 9.8 percent in September 1987.
   The Department of Employment previously reported August's
unemployment rate as 8 percent.
   Total seasonally adjusted unemployment was estimated at 2.266
million people in September, down from a revised 2.272 million in
August and 2.772 million in September 1987.
   The department said that last month's figure was swollen by a
postal strike which prevented people from notifying the department
that they had found employment.
   The monthly trend remained the same with a fall of about 40,000
unemployed a month, it said.

<HEAD>EEC Says Italian Coca-Cola Discount Program Violates Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community said
Thursday some discounts offered Coca-Cola's Italian distributors
violated trading rules because they discouraged competitors from
entering the market.
   The 12-nation trading bloc said in a statement Coca-Cola Export
Corp.-Filiale Italiana, known as Export Italia, agreed to change
its discount program retroactive to Jan. 1.
   The agreement, it said, ``opens the way for normal conditions of
competition to develop on the Italian cola drinks market.''
   ``However,'' it said, ``the (EEC) will be particularly vigilant
in the future and will not fail to act against any agreement or
practice which infringes EEC competition rules.''
   The community said the Italian company San Pellegrino filed a
complaint in September 1987 against Export Italia's discount
program.
   ``Export Italia concluded agreements with many large
distribution companies,'' the statement said. ``It would grant a
rebate to distributors selling only Coca-Cola.''
   ``The amount of these rebates was fixed individually for each
producer,'' it said. ``The agreements often provided clauses
extending the exclusivity to other soft drinks.''
   The EEC said it conducted a preliminary investigation of the
complaint and found that Export Italia ``enjoys a dominant position
on the Italian cola market.''
   It said the so-called fidelity rebate program violated EEC rules
because ``it encourages the distributors to sell only Coca-Cola
and, therefore, prevents or hinders competing producers from
entering the Italian colas market.''
   It found other rebate programs offered by the company also
violated EEC rules, it said. These included offering discounts if
distributors met certain targets that were based on the previous
year's volume.
   But it said the EEC did not object to rebates which were based
on buying various sizes of the same product, resupplying shelves or
using advertising materials.

<HEAD>United Plans Large Purchase Of Boeing Jets, Paper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines is prepared to place an order for
Boeing 757 and 737 jets with a potential value of $6.15 billion, a
newspaper reported today.
   United spokesman Chuck Novak would neither confirm nor deny the
story in today's editions of the Wall Street Journal.
   ``That's a rumor and as a matter of company policy we do not
comment on rumors,'' he said.
   United, the nation's largest airline, plans to turn 30 previous
options for Boeing 757-200 jets into firm orders and take new
options for 40 more of the aircraft, the Journal reported, citing
unnamed industry sources.
   At about $45 million per aircraft, that part of the deal would
have a potential value of $3.15 billion, the newspaper said.
   In addition, the Journal said, Chicago-based United is ready to
place orders for 35 Boeing 737s and options for 65 more. Based on a
unit price of about $30 million, the 737s would have a potential
worth of $3 billion, according to the report.
   Boeing Co. would not comment on the story.
   ``We just don't discuss anything we are doing with any of our
customers without their permission,'' said Boeing spokeswoman
Elizabeth Reese in Seattle.

   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit swelled to
$12.18 billion in August as a record level of American exports was
swamped by an all-time high in imports, the government reported
today.
   The Commerce Department said that the imbalance between what the
United States imports and what it sells abroad climbed by $2.7
billion over a July deficit of $9.47 billion.
   The July figure, which followed a $13.22 billion June imbalance,
had been the smallest monthly deficit in more than three years.
Economists had expected an increase for August, but the actual
result was worse than the $11.3 billion many forecasters had
predicted.
   Financial markets had been tensed waiting for the trade report,
remembering that a worse-than-expected August deficit a year ago
had prompted a 95-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average
just a few days before the Black Monday stock crash of Oct. 19.
   Today, however, the markets appeared to be riding out the bad
news.
   The dollar tumbled briefly in foreign exchange markets but soon
rebounded. The Dow Jones average climbed through the morning with
analysts saying the market appeared to have taken the news largely
into account with its decline on Wednesday.
   The Reagan administration moved quickly to put the best face on
the new trade figures, insisting that the August increase was only
a brief interruption to the downward trend in the deficit figures
evident for most of this year.
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity said that if the wide
swings in July and August were averaged, the result would be a
monthly deficit of $10.8 billion for the two months, down from an
average of $11.8 billion in the first six months of the year.
   ``I have been saying for some time that we can hope for an
improvement of about $30 billion in our trade deficit this year.
The figures for the first eight months show that we are on target
at an annual rate of $139 billion,'' Verity said in a statement.
   Despite the administration's assurances, the widening deficit
was certain to provide ammunition for Michael Dukakis, who has
charged that the soaring trade deficits of the 1980s have cost
America millions of lost jobs and represent one of the greatest
failures of the Reagan administration.
   Vice President George Bush has sought to minimize month-to-month
variations in the deficit, pointing instead to the fact that the
deficit for the entire year is headed lower.
   For the first eight months of the year, the trade deficit is
running at an annual rate of $138.2 billion, a substantial
improvement from the record deficit of $170.3 billion suffered in
1987.
   Indeed, the shrinking of the deficit has been the principal
reason for the better-than-expected economic growth so far this
year. Economists attribute about half of overall growth to the
improving trade deficit.
   U.S. exports rose to a record level of $27.55 billion in August,
an increase of $1.03 billion over the July level.
   After suffering hard times from mid-1984 through 1986, American
industry has been enjoying a boom as the lower value of the dollar
has made U.S. goods competitive once again on overseas markets.
   But, unfortunately, the weaker dollar has not had much impact in
slowing Americans' appetite for imported goods, even though they
now cost more.
   Imports jumped to an all-time high of $39.72 billion in August,
an increase of $3.73 billion from the July level.
   Analysts have said that the country has seen about as much of an
improvement as can be expected from higher exports and a further
shrinking in overall deficit will not occur until imports begin to
fall.
   The rise in imports in August reflected identical increases of
$1.1 billion for business capital goods and consumer goods. Imports
of foreign cars were up $700 million while oil imports rose by $300
million to $3.7 billion.
   The higher foreign oil bill reflected an increase in volume as
the average price per barrel fell by 62 cents to $15.15 per barrel.
   The higher export sales reflected an increase of $800 million in
sales of American autos and a smaller rise of $200 million in the
category that includes farm products.
   By country, the largest deficit, as usual, was with Japan, an
imbalance of $4.8 billion, up from a July deficit of $4.4 billion.
The deficit rose to $1.7 billion with Taiwan, compared to $1.2
billion in July, while the deficit with Western Europe shrank to
$1.4 billion, down from $2.3 billion in July.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Slightly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened moderately
higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade in anticipation of
increased export sales due to poor crops elsewhere and the dollar's
weakness against other major currencies.
   The higher opening surprised analysts who had expected a drop in
prices based on Wednesday's crop production estimates from the
Agriculture Department, which projected slightly larger corn and
soybean crops than it had previously estimated.
   But the agency also reduced its estimates for end-of-the year
stockpiles of corn and wheat, reflecting expectations of greater
foreign demand for those grains.
   ``You've also got to realize the fact that the dollar was
sharply lower this morning and yesterday, and that should keep our
grains competitive on the world market,'' said Joel Karlin,
research analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Further support came from hopes of a new U.S.-Soviet long-term
grain purchase agreement, he said. Negotiators for the two
countries were scheduled to meet this afternoon in London.
   In early trading, wheat was 2\ cents to 3} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.38 a bushel; corn was 1}
cents to 2\ cents higher with December at $2.98} a bushel; oats
were 1{ cents to 1} cents higher with December at $2.58{ a bushel;
soybeans were 2{ cents to 6} cents higher with November at $7.97 a
bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were slightly
higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .22 cent higher with October
at 72.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .25
cent higher with October at 82 cents a pound; live hogs were .10
cent to .40 cent higher with October at 40.70 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .87 cent to 1.08 cents higher with February at
49.05 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Coniston Reviews Options After TW Rejects Merger Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coniston Partners said Thursday it is mulling
its options after food services giant TW Services Inc. rejected its
$1.4 billion merger proposal.
   In a statement issued late Wednesday, TW said its board turned
down the proposal after its financial advisers determined that the
$28 a share Coniston offered to pay was inadequate.
   The board reaffirmed TW's ``belief that its shareholders will be
served best by the company remaining independent,'' the statement
said.
   Augustus Oliver, a Coniston principal, said the partnership is
reviewing its alternatives, which include launching a hostile
tender offer. While Coniston is under no time constraints on making
a decision, Oliver reiterated the firm's interest in owning TW,
which runs the Denny's restaurant chain.
   New York-based Coniston already owns about 19 percent of TW's
48.5 million outstanding shares. The partnership outlined its
proposal for a friendly merger in a letter to the TW board earlier
this month.
   ``We're obviously disappointed at their response,'' Oliver said,
adding that ``it's worth noting that they never made any attempt to
contact us about the offer ... (or) to discuss their views on the
price.''
   In its letter to TW, Coniston said that while $28 a share was an
``extremely favorable price,'' it might be willing to offer more if
TW could ``demonstrate sufficient business prospects to justify
doing so.''
   Oliver said that Coniston still thinks the price is ``extremely
high, and we haven't heard anyone out there in the financial
community taking great issue with that.''
   On the New York Stock Exchange, TW was trading at $26.50 share
at midday, unchanged from Wednesday.
   TW Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frank Salizzoni noted
that the company's earnings have grown at a rate in excess of 20
percent over the past two years and predicted the trend to continue
``for the foreseeable future.''
   ``We believe that our shareholders will benefit more from TW's
continued growth and performance than from the Coniston'' proposal.
   Oliver countered, however, that the board is protecting
shareholders and said, rhetorically, ``Why don't they simply let
the stockholders decide rather than make the decision for them?''
   In addition to Denny's, TW is a franchisee of the Hardee's
restaurant chain. The New York-based company also runs Canteen
Corp., a food services concern, and a small nursing home chain.
   TW reported net income of $47.2 million on sales of $2.5 billion
in 1987.

<TEXT>
   The Cooper Companies Inc. have reached
a definitive agreement to sell its Technicon unit to a subsidiary
of Bayer USA Inc., in a deal estimated at $500 million, the
companies announced Thursday.
   Miles Inc., a healthcare company headquartered in Elkhart, Ind.,
will buy all of the capital stock of Cooper Technicon Inc. for $212
million in cash. In addition, Cooper Technicon's outstanding debt,
estimated at $288 million, will be eliminated, the companies said.
   The proposed transaction is expected to be completed by the end
of the year, according to a Cooper statement.
   Cooper Technicon, based in Tarrytown, N.Y., had 1987 sales of
about $470 million. It develops, manufactures and markets automated
medical diagnostic systems for hospitals and large commercial
clinical laboratories.
   The sale does not include the company's worldwide contact lens
or plastic and reconstructive surgical products business.
   Cooper co-chairman Gary Singer said the deal means the company
is moving ``to complete our asset divestiture program and embark on
a restructuring and revitalization of the company.''
   The agreement is subject to the approval of Cooper shareholders
and regulatory agencies.
   ``The acquisition of Technicon achieves our strategic objectives
for the diagnostics business worldwide by strengthening the
company's representation in the hospital and commercial clinical
laboratory market segments,'' said Dr. Klaus H. Risse, president
and chief executive of Miles, which manufactures medical diagnostic
systems under the Miles and Ames names.
   Risse said Technicon will become part of Miles' Diagnostics
Business Group.
   Earlier this month, Cooper announced it had signed a letter of
intent to sell Cooper Surgical, its ophthalmic surgical products
business, to Alcon Laboratories for about $325 million.
   It sold its U.S. contact lens care solutions business to
Wesley-Jessen for $40 million.

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.72 to 155.49. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .14 at 302.05.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 79 million shares at noontime,
up from 78.04 million at the same point Wednesday.

   Pepsico on Thursday reported its profits for the
third quarter jumped 27 percent on increased sales of its soft
drinks and snack foods and on a lower tax rate.
   The Purchase, N.Y.-based company said it earned $241.6 million,
or 91 cents a share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $189.9
million, or 72 cents a share a year ago.
   Sales during the period totaled $3.24 billion, up 12 percent
from $2.90 billion in the third quarter of 1987.
   In addition to volume and margin improvements, Pepsico
attributed its strong performance to a decline in the U.S.
corporate tax rate.
   In the soft drinks division, sales rose 15 percent amid
increased shipments worldwide, improved operating margins overseas
and the acquisition of domestic bottling operations. The company
highlighted increased sales of Diet Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Pepsi.
   Sales of snack foods advanced 8 percent, partly due to an
improved performance at Frito Lay. Pepsico said restaurant sales
were up 11 percent, led by growth at Kentucky Fried Chicken and
Pizza Hut. but earnings at Taco Bell declined.
   Wayne Calloway, chairman and chief executive officer, noted that
the company's international businesses emerged as ``solid
contributors to our growth.''
   For the year to date, Pepsico reported net income of $574.5
million, or $2.18 a share, up 28 percent from $447.8 million, or
$1.70 a share a year ago. Excluding operations discontinued last
year, income was up 25 percent.
   Sales for the first nine months totaled $8.82 billion, up 11
percent from $7.93 billion in the year-ago period.

   The president and chief executive officer of
Volkswagen of America Inc., has been named to the same position at
a Ford-Volkswagen joint venture in South America, the West
Germany-based automaker said Thursday.
   Noel Phillips will become president and chief executive officer
of Autolatina on July 1, 1989. The company was formed in 1987 when
Volkswagen and Ford Motor Co. merged their operations in Brazil and
Argentina.
   Hans-Jorg Hungerland, 47, will replace Phillips on March 1,
1989, the company said. Hungerland is export sales manager for
Volkswagen AG in Wolfsburg, West Germany, the parent corporation
for the American company.
   Hungerland joined Volkswagen in 1958 and was general manager of
the corporate service division of Volkswagen of America from 1980
to 1983.
   Phillips, 54, joined Volkswagen in South Africa in 1960 and
became executive vice president for sales and marketing for
Volkswagen of America in 1978. In 1981, he went back to South
Africa for two years as managing director of a holding company, and
returned to the United States at the end of 1982 as president and
chief executive officer of Volkswagen of America.

<HEAD>Merrill Lynch Third Quarter Earnings Tumble 66.4 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street giant Merrill Lynch & Co. reported a
66.4 percent slide in third-quarter earnings Thursday, attributing
it to the post-crash stock slump and an extraordinary gain in the
year-earlier period.
   Merrill Lynch also announced a major accounting change in its
employee retirement program that will free $220 million in excess
pension funds that have accumulated over the past few years and
return the money to the company.
   Executives briefing reporters about the pension plan change said
the 32,700 employees affected would continue to receive equivalent
benefits under the new arrangement and would be able to participate
in a stock ownership plan that takes effect next year.
   Courtney Jones, chief financial officer, said the company would
use the $220 million surplus for various purposes but did not
elaborate. He said the change would be reflected in fourth-quarter
earnings results but did not estimate them.
   Third-quarter earnings totaled $65.6 million or 58 cents a share
for the three months ended Sept. 30, vs. $195.1 million or $1.78 a
share in the equivalent period a year earlier, the company said in
an earnings statement.
   Total revenues in the third quarter totaled $2.79 billion vs.
$2.66 billion, a 4.8 percent increase. But commission revenues
tumbled 33.9 percent.
   The results partly reflected a severe decline in investor demand
for stocks in the aftermath of the October 1987 market crash, which
has devastated stock trading volumes and brokerage commissions of
many Wall Street investment firms.
   Merrill Lynch said in its earnings statement that the decline in
third-quarter results also reflected an extraordinary $100.3
million after-tax gain in the comparable 1987 quarter, when the
company sold a partnership interest in its Manhattan headquarters.
   While the results were sharply lower, they were fairly
consistent with the 60 percent average drop in third-quarter
earnings that the securities industry has been experiencing.
   Daniel P. Tully, Merrill Lynch president and chief operating
officer, called the results ``positive in an environment marked by
an industry-wide decline in activity, particularly among individual
investors.''
   Other Merrill Lynch officials said the company's effort over the
past several years to diversify into other areas, such as
investment banking, bond trading and corporate takeover financing,
had helped defray the impact of the stock market slump.
   For the first nine months of the year, Merrill Lynch earnings
totaled $187 million or $1.67 a share, a 51.7 percent drop from the
$387 million or $3.52 a share earned in the first nine months of
1987.
   Revenue for the nine months totaled $7.68 billion vs. $7.50
billion, a 2.3 percent increase. But commission revenue fell 33.8
percent.
   Merrill Lynch is one of the largest U.S. investment and
financial services firms, with capital of $3 billion and more than
500 offices worldwide.

<TEXT>
   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange rose
strongly Thursday, as dealers breathed a sigh of relief that the
U.S. trade report for August did not confirm the market's worst
fears.
   World financial markets had suffered a bout of jitters before
the release of the report, with rumors circulating that there would
be a pronounced widening in the trade gap.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up
16.4 points, or 0.9 percent higher, at 1,830.7, near the
mid-afternoon best level for the day of 1,831.1.
   Volume was modest, with 464.2 million shares changing hands,
compared with the 476.5 million shares traded Wednesday.
   The U.S. Commerce Department announced that the merchandise
trade gap for August widened to $12.18 billion from a revised $9.47
billion in July.
   Several market observers had predicted a shortfall between $11.3
billion and $12.5 billion, but rumors abounded that the trade gap
might balloon to as much as $15 billion.
   ``The market had braced for a number far worse,'' said Kevin
Gardiner, an economist at Warburg Securities in London.
   Gardiner suggested that the market had been looking back
nervously to a year ago, when the July trade figure of $17.08
billion unhinged world financial markets preceding the October
stock market crash.
   ``There was concern that history might repeat itself,'' Gardiner
said.
   But on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was 10.31
points higher at 2,136.56 as London trading ended Thursday, having
opened about 4 points lower.

<HEAD>Khaki-Clad Poultry Millionaire Don Tyson: `We're Chicken Folks'</HEAD>
<HEAD>REPEAT for all needing</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LR3 of Oct. 12</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT CHARTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Don Tyson arrives at his sprawling Ozarks
corporate complex each workday attired in company-issue tan slacks
and shirt, just like most of his 17,000 employees in Arkansas.
   He even has his first name in red script on the chest, right
next to a red and orange Tyson Foods logo.
   The 58-year-old chairman of the nation's largest poultry
processing company says dressing fancy might keep him from visiting
its scores of growing houses and processing plants, which yield 14
million pounds of chicken a week.
   Besides, Tyson says he doesn't have to worry about whether his
tie complements his shirt.
   This is no country bumpkin. A Rolex peeks from beneath his khaki
shirt cuff, and a black Lincoln Continental is parked outside. This
week, Forbes magazine listed Tyson as the 245th wealthiest U.S.
resident, with an estimated net worth of $330 million.
   That means a lot of drumsticks have been sold since his father,
the late John Tyson, started the Springdale-based chicken company
``with half a load of hay and 5 cents in 1930.''
   That's how his son, who was unavailable Wednesday, described the
origin of the firm in a 1985 interview with The Associated Press.
   ``We're chicken folks. We're just nothing else. We don't shoot a
shotgun at the consumer. We shoot a rifle and its got chicken in it
every time we shoot,'' Tyson said.
   Tyson Foods' 1987 annual report listed gross annual sales of
$1.8 billion, with net income of $67 million.
   The report also offered the chairman's philosophy about
acquiring other companies, wrapped in the gleeful language Tyson
applies to his frequent Caribbean fishing trips: ``We'd buy this
afternoon if the right opportunity came along. Acquisitions are
like fishing _ you never know when you're going to snag one. Our
hooks are in the water all the time.''
   Tyson cast his hook eastward Tuesday to Memphis, Tenn.,
headquarters of Holly Farms, the nation's No. 3 poultry company.
   Tyson offered $45 cash and a quarter share of Tyson Foods' Class
A common stock for each of Holly Farms' 18.1 million outstanding
shares.
   The deal would be worth nearly $900 million based on Tuesday's
closing prices _ Holly Farms closed at $43 a share, up $2.37{ in
New York Stock Exchange trading, while Tyson rose 62.5 cents a
share to $17.62{ in national over-the-counter trading.
   From the booming northwestern corner of Arkansas, Tyson's
influence is felt across the Ozarks into the southern flatlands. A
Tyson mill at Pine Bluff, in the southeast, turns out processed
poultry. Buildings in Nashville, to the southwest, produce millions
of birds.
   The company has the biggest payroll in Arkansas farming, says
Clifton Meador, director of agriculture for the Arkansas Industrial
Development Commission. ``Tyson's means an awful lot to the economy
of Arkansas, that's all there is to it,'' he says.
   Don Allen, executive director of the Arkansas Poultry
Federation, estimates Tyson Foods controls about half of the
state's $1.53 billion broiler business, with the remainder split
among seven other companies.
   ``We're just trying to be good neighbors,'' says Tyson spokesman
Bob Justice.
   Tyson rarely grants formal interviews. But he was at stage
center last month as the Arkansas Business Council, comprised of 19
of the state's wealthiest businessmen, released a sweeping yearlong
study of education.
   The bearded, balding chicken chairman isn't all business. ``He
has a darn good sense of humor and he doesn't take himself too
seriously. He is very down to earth. He can tell a joke and he can
take one,'' Allen says.
   Tyson's headquarters are decorated with western sculpture. Two
colorful paintings of fighting cocks on his office wall were gifts
from actor Jack Lord. Carved eggs are worked with whimsy into the
room's wood trim, and it has a white domed ceiling, ``just like the
Oval Office,'' Tyson says.
   He was a major backer of Jimmy Carter's presidential campaigns
and chips in to Democratic treasuries. Country star Willie Nelson
has flown into the Ozarks to entertain for Tyson's birthday in a
hotel ballroom. Senators and governors have been special guests at
the parties.
   A major Tyson diversion is University of Arkansas sports.
Athletic Director Frank Broyles, who has known Tyson 30 years,
calls him ``a brilliant person and close personal friend.'' Tyson
pays $10,000 a year for Razorback Stadium's largest posh skybox,
where he entertains pals at Fayetteville football games.
   ``Don is dedicated to growth and prosperity, not just for our
program, but for the whole state,'' Broyles says, ``and he's got
one of the quickest minds of any person I've ever known.''

<TEXT>
   American manufacturers need to install
more automated machinery or lose jobs and sales to efficient
foreign competitors that share technology with their peers,
according to a Harvard University study released Thursday.
   The survey of more than 1,300 U.S. metalworking plants concluded
that American industry is clinging to an outdated notion that big
firms should not share technological advances with potential
competitors.
   ``Relations between large and small firms is not part of the
business culture in the United States,'' said Maryellen R. Kelley,
an assistant management professor at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh and one of the study's authors.
   ``That kind of boost to small manufacturers that encourages them
to automate is absent,'' she said.
   The study found that more than half of U.S. metalworking plants
have not installed any computer-controlled machinery and just one
in 10 plants planned to invest in computerization in 1988-89.
   ``In the long run, if small manufacturers in particular don't
modernize, they will no longer be able to compete ... with more
sophisticated foreign suppliers,'' Kelley said. ``That could
ultimately lead to a loss of jobs.''
   The study found that just 11 percent of machine tools used in
the American metalworking industry are computer-controlled. Kelley
said a similar 1985 study of Japanese firms found that 30 percent
of the total stock was computer-run.
   ``The model of the self-interested, do-it-alone small business
driven by a gear of cut-throat competition ... seems to be a
peculiarly American phenomenon,'' the report issued by the Center
for Business and Government at the John F. Kennedy School of
Government said.
   The authors said America's competitive culture ``must change if
U.S. industry is to continue to be an industrial power in the world
economy.'' In countries such as Japan and Italy potential
competitors as well as buyers and suppliers routinely share
information, they said.
   The survey of metalworking and machinery manufacturers in 21
durable goods industries, including hardware, plumbing and forging,
was based on a national mail questionnaire and interviews with more
than 1,300 firms nationwide. An equal distribution of companies
with workforces ranging from under 20 to more than 250 was used.
   The study, ``The State of Computerized Automation in U.S.
Manufacturing,'' was conducted from September 1986 to April 1987.
It was funded by the National Science Foundation and the U.S.
Congress' Office of Technology Assessment.
   According to the survey, 53 percent of U.S. plants use
conventional machinery while 47 percent have some type of
computer-operated machines.
   ``Surprisingly we found that there has not been much adoption of
competitive technology _ and this is after five years of economic
recovery,'' Kelley, a Kennedy School research associate, said in an
interview.
   Small manufacturers have resisted the adoption of
computer-controlled technology partly out of a fear of job losses
through automation and partly because high expenses would require
product diversification, Kelley said.
   ``It certainly seems that this technology is more efficient and
seems to be more flexible,'' she said. ``But that means a shift in
business strategy is required.''
   The 22 percent of plants that said they have not adopted
computer-controlled technology and have no plans to do so accounted
for 1 million jobs in 1986 _ jobs Kelley said are threatened by
foreign competition.
   The industries surveyed make tools used in machinery for
production of a variety of durable goods, from furniture to
clothing. Kelley said three types of machines dominate the field:
numerically controlled, computer numerically controlled and
flexible manufacturing systems.
   Numerically controlled machinery is usully manually operated.
Computer numerically controlled machinery allows machines to be
programmed to automatically execute a set of metal-cutting
operations, which reduces the cost of set-up and permits repeat
runs of a product.
   Flexible manufacturing systems, used by just 1.5 percent of the
firms surveyed, are computer numerically controlled machines linked
by automatic material-handling equipment such as robots or
conveyors.

   Earlier this month, when the nation's largest
retailers announced their results for September, people with an eye
on apparel sales breathed just the barest sighs of relief.
   The numbers brought the first signals that a year-long drought
in clothing sales might be approaching an end. But, industry
watchers stress, the key word is ``might.''
   ``All of the major retailers are showing some fashion strength,
but it has to be taken in some context,'' said Walter Loeb, a
retail industry analyst with the investment firm Morgan Stanley &
Co.
   Donald I. Trott, who tracks specialty retailers for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., called September apparel sales ``very good,'' but
said he was not fully convinced they marked the beginning of a
trend.
   The nation's largest specialty apparel retailer, Limited Inc.,
reported that sales at its stores open for at least a year _ known
in the business as same-store sales _ rose 7 percent last month
from September 1987.
   The company's overall sales picked up 11 percent in September,
but analysts believe same-store sales more accurately reflect a
retailer's performance than figures that include the results of
newer stores.
   Fred Wintzer, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. in
Baltimore, was optimistic because Limited's sales have gradually
improved in recent months, especially at its Limited Express stores
that cater to teens and young women.
   Wintzer estimated Limited Express' same-store sales soared 30
percent in September, and said he expected Limited Inc. to be the
pacesetter for other apparel retailers.
   ``This is the company that will lead the pack,'' he said. ``The
rest of the industry will pick up on it after it's definitely
working at the Limited _ this is the way it always goes.''
   Limited and other retailers are trying to recover from the
problems they encountered in the fall of 1987: Fashion lines
fizzled as women shied away from shorter skirt lengths and decided
they had had enough of baggy, oversized casual wear.
   Clothing sales nosedived, and retailers, forced to take heavy
markdowns to clear merchandise, saw their profits slide as well.
And, because the stores had already ordered the same styles for
spring 1988, their slump persisted through this summer.
   For fall, retailers have experimented with more tailored and
dressy fashions and they reinstated longer skirts.
   Bloomingdale's, known for its trendy apparel, brought back a
large selection of ``career'' clothes not seen at the store for
several years.
   Limited stores _ the flagship division of Limited Inc. _ has
featured suits, and Limited Express, which sells mostly casual
clothes, has hints of the tailored look with pleated pants and
cable-knit cardigan sweaters.
   But while sales have improved, no one can point to a specific
fashion item or style that is extraordinarily successful.
   Gap Inc., which has continued to stress the casual look, says
its sales have come on a broad selection of merchandise.
   ``I can't put my finger on any individual items that have been
blowing out of the stores,'' said Warren Hashagen, Gap's vice
president and treasurer.
   ``We've got more fashion merchandise and a steady flow of new
items in new colors coming in,'' he said. ``That flow of
merchandise has caused customers to come back.''
   Gap does not report its sales monthly. However, Trott, of Dean
Witter, estimated Gap's same-store sales rose during September by a
percentage ``in the low to mid teens.''
   A year ago, Gap was the most prominent victim of the fashion
slump. After a disastrous August 1987, the company announced a
sharp downward revision in its expected profit for that quarter.
   Investors responded by dumping Gap and other retail stocks.
Gap's shares, which had traded at nearly $78 in August, plunged to
just under $37 a month later. In two days alone, the stock fell
nearly $19.
   Having watched the industry stumble its way through the ensuing
year, analysts say they have reasons to be cautious.
   For one thing, the September increases were what the analysts
call ``easy comparisons,'' because they were made against the
depressed results of a year earlier. The industry watchers say
sales must improve by double-digit percentages to be meaningful.
   Trott said several questions remain to be answered, such as how
much of the sales increase is due to price inflation.
   ``I'm not sure what that means in terms of numbers of garments
sold,'' he said of the September results.
   William Smith, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.,
said ``It's a bit early to generalize,'' and predicted October
sales would give a better idea of how healthy clothing sales are.
   And Wintzer, the Alex. Brown analyst, although upbeat about
Limited, said, ``For the rest of the industry to get in the swing
of this, the earliest it will happen is next spring.''

<HEAD>Dollar Plummets on Trade News, Gold Prices Also Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar plummeted against major foreign
currencies in heavy selling Thursday after the American government
reported a sharp widening of the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in
August.
   However, the U.S. currency later managed to bounce back up above
its worst levels of the day.
   Gold prices also fell, but not as dramatically.
   The August deficit of $12.18 billion compared with a revised
shortfall of $9.47 billion in July, was near the top end of market
expectations, and prompted a bout of heavy selling that pushed the
dollar to a session low of around 1.8110 West German marks.
   ``The figure was as bad as expected, or maybe a bit worse,'' one
dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt said. ``The dollar is now
battered.''
   Dealers said technical support at the 1.8100-mark level and
rumors that the U.S. Federal Reserve was checking dollar-yen rates
helped to push the dollar back to its closing levels.
   But market players added that sentiment remained bearish, and
most said they expected the dollar to continue its downward move.
   Any decline, however, would be limited by fear of central bank
effort to prop the dollar up.
   The Frankfurt dealer said: ``The central banks will make sure
that the dollar moves down only gradually. They don't want to risk
a crash, and just one year after the crash, this psychology is
strong in the market.''
   Some analysts say the October 1987 stock market crash was
triggered partly by worse-than-expected trade figures, which had
sent the dollar into a tailspin.
   is no way the central banks will let the dollar fall too far
ahead of the (U.S. presidential) elections in November,'' a London
dealer said.
   In London, the dollar sank against the British pound. It cost
$1.7470 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7305 Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8193 West German marks, down from
1.8340; 1.5390 Swiss francs, down from 1.5587; 6.1995 French
francs, down from 6.2770; 2.0475 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0760;
1,354.00 Italian lire, down from 1,379.00; and 1.2084 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2118.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 127.98 yen, down 1.67 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 127.95 yen.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $406.70 a troy ounce,
compared with $409.25 bid late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, gold was lower, closing at a bid $406.50 compared
with $408.10 bid late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.69 to close at a bid $411.22.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.29 a troy ounce, compared
with Wednesday's $6.35.

<TEXT>
   Felix Wankel, inventor of the rotary
engine, has died in his native country, friends of the motor
designer said Thursday.
   Wankel died on Sunday. He was 86.
   Wankel began work on a rotary engine in 1926, culminating with
production of the new-design motor at the West German NSU Motor
Works in 1957.
   Through the years, Wankel also designed motors for the Japanese
auto companies Mazda and Toyota, said Thomas Burkhardt, a close
friend of the German inventor.
   He also designed engine superchargers, Burkhardt said.
   Wankel's research offices are located in Lindau, on the shores
of Lake Constance in southern West Germany.
   Wankel's wife died in 1978 and they had no children, said
Burkhardt.

<HEAD>Prime Computer Buying GE's Calma Unit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Computer Inc. said Thursday it will acquire
General Electric Co.'s Calma business, which makes computer-aided
design and manufacturing systems, for an undisclosed price.
   The move will increase Prime's share of the computer-aided
design and manufacturing market while getting GE out of a
money-losing business which it entered with fanfare in 1981.
   With its $435 million takeover of Computervision Inc. in
February, Prime already is the second leading supplier behind
International Business Machines Corp. in the field of
computer-aided design and manufacturing systems.
   Calma, based in Milpitas, Calif., has 650 employees. GE, which
bought Calma for $170 million in 1981, said it has failed to earn a
profit in recent years, but the company declined to release figures
on either its sales or losses.
   Salomon Brothers Inc., a New York investment banking house,
estimated Calma's sales at $200 million in 1985 and $210 million in
1986.
   One of Calma's biggest customers has been Fairfield, Conn.-based
GE, which said it will give Prime ``preferred vendor'' status and
access to GE's corporate research in the field after the sale is
completed in approximately 90 days.
   Analysts said the acquisition appears to complement Prime's
current businesses, but could prove difficult for the Natick-based
computer maker to absorb.
   ``I think it's a good strategic move in the same sense and
direction that buying Computervision was. It could solidify the
company's position in the CAD-CAM market,'' said Carol E. Muratore,
an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co.
   ``But strategy is only one part of the puzzle,'' she added.
``Execution is the other, and that remains to be seen. They're
still very early in the process of assimilating Computervision, and
there are no clear signs yet that they have done that well.''
   The companies said some reductions in Calma's workforce are
likely before the end of the year. But they said the numbers have
not been determined.
   Prime reported earnings of $21.7 million on revenues of $772.1
million for the first six months of this year. Those earnings were
down from $27.6 million in the same period of 1987, despite an
increase in revenues from $457.8 million. Most of the rise in
revenues was due to the Computervision takeover.
   Last week, former GE executive Anthony L. Craig was named to
succeed Prime President Joe M. Henson in a few months. Both
companies said the move was unrelated to the Calma sale.

<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raytheon Co. said Thursday its
third-quarter earnings rose 10.5 percent over the same period last
year with the help of a 7.4 percent increase in sales.
   Raytheon said other factors contributing to the earnings jump
were its improved operating performance and lower taxes.
   Earnings rose to $126.6 million, or $1.91 per share, on sales of
$1.99 billion, compared with 1987's third quarter earnings of
$114.6 million, or $1.57 per share, on sales of $1.86 billion.
   ``The third quarter was another strong one for Raytheon,''
Chairman Thomas L. Phillips said in a prepared statement. ``We ...
received important government awards during the quarter for
submarine combat control systems, missile programs and FAA
technical support services.''
   The electronics and defense equipment manufacturer said sales in
major appliances continued to outpace those of last year, but
profits were lower due to higher material costs and stiff price
competition.
   Provisions for federal and foreign income taxes were $54.7
million in the quarter, compared with $61.6 million last year.
   For the first nine months of the year, Raytheon earned $362.3
million, or $5.43 per share, up 10.7 percent from $327.2 million,
or $4.44 a share, in the same period of 1987.
   Sales for the first nine months totaled $5.98 billion, up from
$5.52 billion.

   Allied-Signal Inc. said Thursday it has received
a patent for a new lubricating system that will permit the use of
substitutes for an ozone-depleting material in car air conditioners.
   The lubricating system is not suited for other kinds of air
conditioners or refrigerators, said Allied-Signal, of Morristown,
N.J., which has a big auto parts business.
   The system was developed at Allied-Signal's laboratory in
Buffalo, N.Y.
   It permits the use in car air conditioners of a substance called
HFC 134a that is a substitute for CFC-12, a chlorofluorocarbon that
contributes to the depletion of the Earth's protective ozone layer.

   The House today put off until Tuesday a vote
on Senate-approved legilsation to require issuers of credit and
charge cards to disclose information about interest rates, fees and
other details before consumers apply for the cards.
   The House leadership had promised members who wanted to leave
the nation's capital for the weekend that there would be no
roll-call votes after 1 p.m. today. The bill, although debated,
came up for a vote shortly before 2 p.m.
   Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the House
Banking Committee, called the measure ``one of the most important
and strongest credit disclosure acts that we have been able to move
through the Congress since the first truth-in-lending statute was
passed 20 years ago.''
   He said the measure ``ends the hide-and-seek approach to
disclosures on credit card terms. It prevents sneak attacks on
unsuspecting consumers who often learn of charges and fees long
after the fact _ too late to reject the card and seek
alternatives.''
   Under present law, terms of credit and charge card accounts do
not have to be disclosed until after a card is issued. More than
105.5 million Americans hold 800 million of the cards.
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., consumer affairs subcommittee
chairman who sponsored the bill approved by the Senate on a voice
vote Tuesday night, said full, advance disclosure of card fees and
terms would enable consumers to weigh the costs and benefits of
signing up for particular credit or charge cards.
   Now, he said, the cost information is given to consumers too
late to make a difference.
   ``The information is often confusing and difficult to read, and
arrives at a time when the consumer cannot very well shop around
for a better rate,'' said Dodd. ``This late disclosure of
information is in sharp contrast to the way card issuers solicit
consumers. We all know how that is done. All you have to do is read
your mail to know that lenders rely heavily on mail solicitations.''
   The legislation would require all direct mail applications and
solicitations to contain clear information on the annual interest
rate, any minimum finance charge, any transaction fee, the grace
period and the method of calculation used in computing the balance
for interest purposes. Issuers also must clearly state any cash
advance fees, late fees and over-the-limit fees.
   The measure still falls short of the disclosure requirements
sought by some members of Congress and consumer groups.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the House Banking
consumer affairs subcommittee, said, ``This bill does not help the
consumer.''
   Leslie Gainer, an official of the Ralph Nader-organized U.S.
Public Interest Research Group, said the legislation fails to go
far enough with the new disclosure rules and pre-empts states from
passing stronger laws.
   The Consumer Bankers Association, which represents approximately
800 federally insured banks, savings and loans and credit unions,
endorsed the legislation.
   Joe Belew, the association president, said the measure
``provides for simple, meaningful disclosures which ensure that
consumers can compare terms on credit cards. Its enactment will
show that consumer and industry representatives can work together
to produce legislation which benefits the public.''

   The Big Three U.S. automakers reported Thursday
that early October car sales rose 38.7 percent compared with the
same period last year, when the flurry over big incentives ended
with the new model year.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. sold
173,156 U.S.-made cars during the Oct. 1-10 period this year,
compared with 140,408 cars in early October last year.
   There were eight selling days in the period this year, compared
with nine last year.
   Through the late summer and early fall of 1987, automakers drew
car buyers into showrooms with big cash-back incentives and
financing deals with interest rates as low as 1.9 percent.
   Some consumers accelerated their mid- or late-autumn car-buying
plans to take advantage of the incentives before they expired with
the 1987 model year on Sept. 30, 1987, resulting in
lower-than-anticipated sales figures for October of last year.
   For the calendar year through Oct. 10, the Big Three reported
U.S.-made cars sales of 5,479,125 vehicles in 1988, a 4.4 percent
rise from the 5,245,693 cars they sold during the same time last
year.
   There were 239 selling days in both Jan. 1-Oct. 10 selling
periods.
   Among the Big Three in early October, Ford showed the largest
increase, with car sales jumping 70 percent to 58,407 this year
compared with 38,662 last year. Light truck sales increased 23.1
percent to 33,574 in 1988 from 30,681 the year before.
   GM showed a 31.7 percent rise to 90,183 cars in early October
this year, compared with 77,032 cars during the period last year.
GM's light truck sales rose 29.3 percent in the Oct. 1-10 period
this year, going to 41,010 vehicles this year compared with 35,693
last year.
   Chrysler Corp.'s U.S.-made car sales rose 11.8 percent to 24,566
vehicles in early October, compared with 24,714 cars during the
same period last year. Its light trucks sales went to 19,297 during
this year's 10-day period from 19,667 during the same period last
year _ a 10.4 percent increase.

   Penn Central Corp. will buy Republic American
Corp. for $249 million under a sweetened agreement announced
Thursday.
   Penn Central, a telecommunications and defense industry firm
which already owns 14.3 percent of Republic American's common
shares, said it will pay $15.75 per share in cash to buy the
remainder of Republic American's approximately 18.4 million common
shares outstanding.
   The Cincinnati-based Penn Central said it will acquire Republic
American by merging it with a newly formed Penn Central subsidiary.
Republic American sells workers' compensation insurance in
California.
   Officials said they expect the deal can be completed in early
1989.
   The agreement sweetens Penn Central's earlier acquisition
proposal to Republic American, announced in July, which provoked
some objections in court by Republic American stockholders.
   Under the original proposal, Penn Central said it would give
Republic American stockholders .65 of a Penn Central common share
for each outstanding Republic American common share. The market
price of Penn Central's common stock was then about $22.50 per
share.
   The two companies announced Thursday that the Republic American
stockholders who sued to challenge the original proposal as
inadequate have agreed to settle their lawsuits in view of the new
merger proposal.

   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade with soybeans up sharply on
rumors that the Soviet Union may have bought 200,000 metric tons of
U.S. soybean meal, analysts said.
   Soybean meal for near-month delivery surged more than $7 a ton
while most soybean contracts gained more than 20 cents a bushel,
pushing the price for November delivery well above $8. Most of the
buying came late in the session after talk of the possible Soviet
purchase surfaced.
   ``They usually are large purchasers of meal in the
November-December period,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with
Research Department Inc. in Chicago. ``Prices had gotten down to a
level that started enticing foreign demand.''
   Grain futures closed mostly higher on spillover buying from the
soybean complex, he said.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents lower to } cent higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.35 a bushel; corn was }

   The stock market turned upward today, seemingly
unfazed by the news of a wider-than-expected U.S. trade deficit in
August.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.90 to 2,135.14 by
3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 8 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 718 up, 635 down and
544 unchanged.
   Before the market opened the Commerce Department reported that
the trade deficit expanded to $12.18 billion in August from $9.47
billion the month before.
   The latest figure slightly exceeded advance estimates on Wall
Street, and send the dollar briefly tumbling in foreign exchange.
But the dollar soon steadied.
   Analysts said the stock market appeared to have taken the news
largely into account with its decline on Wednesday, when the Dow
Jones industrial average fell 30.23 points.
   Today's activity came as a sharp contrast to the release of the
August trade report a year ago, which prompted a 95-point drop in
the Dow just a few days before Black Monday on Oct. 19.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose 1] to 118~; Sears Roebuck gained 2 to 42\, and

   Emhart Corp. said Thursday it has
reached an agreement to acquire GardenAmerica Corp., a maker of
garden watering systems, in a deal worth $84 million.
   Under terms of a deal approved by both companies' boards, Emhart
will pay $28.25 a share for GardenAmerica's outstanding stock.
   GardenAmerica, based in Carson City, Nev., is a leading
designer, manufacturer and marketer of automatic watering systems
for commercial and home markets. Its products, including Lawn Genie
and Drip Mist, are sold in the United States, Australia, France,
Italy and Spain.
   GardenAmerica revenues were $51.4 million for the nine months
ended June 30. The company employs 1,275 people at manufacturing
plants in Carson City, El Paso, Texas and Valencia, Calif.
   Peter L. Scott, Emhart chairman and president, said the
acquistion would expand Emhart's role in the lawn and garden market.
   ``Watering systems comprise one the fastest growing segments in
the overall market,'' he noted. GardenAmerica would become part of
Emhart's consumer unit, which had revenues of $449 million last
year.
   Emhart, based in Farmington, has annual revenues of $2.45
billion. The company manufactures industrial and consumer products
and also is involved in information and electronic systems.

   The 100 highest paid executives in high-technology
companies earned an average of $785,000 last year, and 17 were paid
more than $1 million, according to a survey by a trade publication.
   At the top of the list is Apple Computer Inc. chief executive
officer John Sculley, whose 1987 cash compensation was $2.14
million, Electronic Business magazine reported.
   The figures in the survey, which was compiled largely from proxy
statements, include salaries and cash bonuses, but do not include
non-pay benefits or stock options, which in many cases equal or
exceed the executives' cash compensation.
   The $785,000 average pay was up 23.5 percent from 1986, when the
top 100 earned an average of $633,000.
   The increase is partly a reflection of a good year for the
industry, which saw the top 200 electronics companies' sales rise
7.4 percent and profits soar 53.6 percent, said Linda B. Stallmann,
senior editor of the magazine.
   But, she added, the October 1987 stock market crash and changes
in income tax laws also helped drive up cash compensation.
   ``Executives are preferring cash, because sometimes the stock
options aren't as valuable as they used to be, and the new tax laws
have reduced the value of perquisites like houses or cars,''
Stallmann said.
   The magazine also found a sharp increase in the popularity of
contractual guarantees to compensate top executives in the event
their companies are taken over by hostile raiders.
   ``Because of all the mergers and acquisitions, the chief
executives are looking for more security,'' Stallmann said.
   The 17 million-dollar earners, as listed in the Oct. 15 issue of
Electronic Business, are: Apple's Sculley, $2.14 million; Unisys
chairman W. Michael Blumenthal, $1,549,000; Computer Associates
chairman Charles B. Wang, $1,431,000; Compaq Computer president
Joseph R. Canion, $1,375,000; Seagate Technology president David T.

   Also, Unisys President Paul G. Stern, $1,195,920;
Hewlett-Packard Chairman John A. Young, $1,193,300; and Computer
Associates president Anthony W. Wang, $1,188,000; Xerox chairman

<HEAD>Air Wis Services Rejects Bid from Cove Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>APPLETON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air Wis Services Inc. rejected as
inadequate a $121 million takeover bid from a Connecticut
investment firm, but left the door open for a higher offer.
   The offer of $16.365 a share from Cove Capital Associates Inc.
of Greenwich, Conn., is the fourth takeover bid for the airline
holding company since last November. Cove represents Transmark USA
Inc., an insurance holding company based in Jacksonville, Fla.
   The offer rejected Wednesday includes $14 a share in cash and
$2.36{ in preferred stock.
   The Air Wis board of directors said it would reconsider its
stance if a higher, all-cash offer were made.
   Air Wis officials questioned how much cash Cove and Transmark
could bring to the table without borrowing against assets of Air
Wis, whose Air Wisconsin subsidiary operates United Express airline.
   ``Your proposal to utilize a form of preferred stock to finance
a significant part of your acquisition costs suggests to our board
that Cove Capital and Transmark USA may not have sufficient
resources to effect an acquisition of the company at a reasonable
price without borrowing significantly against the company's
assets,'' Air Wis President Preston Wilbourne told Cove.
   Wilbourne said an acquisition that involved heavy borrowing
could impair Air Wis' plans to expand and to acquire new equipment,
bring route cutbacks and cause defaults on existing financial
agreements.
   Last November, a group headed by Citicorp Venture Capital and
two former executives of United Airlines offered $11.50 a share for
Air Wis.
   That was followed by a bid from former Air Wis chairman Arthur
Hailand and John J. Louis Jr., a director, for $14 a share. Hailand
and Louis later raised their bid to $17 a share, comprised of $14
in cash and $3 in debt.
   All three bids were rejected by the Air Wis board. Hailand was
removed as chairman when the board turned down his first offer.

<HEAD>Continental Illinois Plans Name Change; Expects Record Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four years after the $4.5 billion federal bailout
of its flagship bank, Continental Illinois Corp. is changing its
name to reflect a change in its course, officials said Thursday.
   Pending stockholder approval on Dec. 12, Continental Illinois
will become Continental Bank Corp. and the Continental Illinois
National Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago will become simply the
Continental Bank, said Chairman Thomas C. Theobold.
   In addition, the company plans a dividend increase and an
employee stock-ownership plan to reward its investors and workers
for helping it achieve what it expects will be record high earnings
this year, Theobold said in a statement.
   Continental also will seek shareholder approval for a 1-for-4
reverse stock split to raise the price of its stock in hopes of
attracting more institutional investors.
   The name change, which the company prefers to call a
simplification, reflects Continental's new direction as a national
business bank, Theobold said.
   ``Although proud of our Illinois heritage, we want a name that
more accurately reflects the national scope of our business and
reinforces the bank's new strategic direction,'' he said. ``In many
ways, this modification is only a confirmation of how customers and
investors already refer to the bank.''
   The name change is not an attempt to escape the stigma of the
bank's scrape with failure in 1984, said spokeswoman Holly Anderson.
   ``We've always been Continental Bank _ that's our acceptable
second reference,'' she said.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. saved the Continental
Illinois Bank from collapse in June 1984, halting a $20 million run
on deposits prompted by concerns about the stability of the bank,
which was at that time among the world's largest.
   Questions about the bank's stability first surfaced following
the failure of the Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City in 1982.
Continental Illinois had bought more than $1 billion in energy
loans from Penn Square and was forced to write off most of them
after the Oklahoma bank collapsed.
   The FDIC purchased $5.2 billion worth of Continental Bank loans
as part of its plan to save the bank from failure. The federal
insurance agency still owns or has options on 69 percent of the
holding company's stock, said Continental spokesman Edgar McDougal.
   Last October, three months after Theobold succeeded John E.
Swearingen as chairman, Continental Illinois announced its plan to
become a ``market-driven business bank devoted to serving
corporations, institutional investors and individuals with complex
financial requirements.''
   In the year since then, the company has sold its consumer retail
business to the First National Bank of Chicago; sold some of its
overseas holdings, including its branches in Seoul, South Korea,
and Taipei, Taiwan; and launched a $5 million advertising campaign
aimed at persuading businesses to bank with Continental.
   The firm earned a record $128.7 million in the first half of
1988 and expects to post record-high annual earnings as well,
Theobold said.
   The quarterly dividend increase from 2 cents to 5 cents per
share and the awarding of stock to employees are gestures of
thanks, Theobold said.
   ``It's time we rewarded our stockholders and employees for their
confidence in us through lean times and gave them reason to expect
continued prosperity in the future,'' he said.
   The reverse stock split will reduce the number of outstanding
shares from 215 million to 54 million and quadruple the stock's
price. Theobold said many institutional investors and brokerage
firms aren't interested in stocks that trade below $10 a share, as
Continental's does.

   The stock market posted a small gain today,
seemingly unfazed by the news of a wider-than-expected U.S. trade
deficit in August.
   Before the market opened the Commerce Department reported that
the trade deficit expanded to $12.18 billion in August from $9.47
billion the month before.
   The latest figure slightly exceeded advance estimates on Wall
Street, and send the dollar briefly tumbling in foreign exchange.
But the dollar soon steadied.
   Analysts said the stock market appeared to have taken the news
largely into account with its decline on Wednesday, when the Dow
Jones industrial average fell 30.23 points.
   Today's activity came as a sharp contrast to the occasion of the
August trade report a year ago, which prompted a 95-point drop in
the Dow just a few days before Black Monday on Oct. 19.

   A University of Pittsburgh survey of United
Steelworkers of America union local leaders showed more than 90
percent would strike for stronger job security, 76 percent would
strike to avoid wage cuts, and 65 percent would strike if an
employer offered no contract improvements.
   In addition, the survey of 950 leaders showed about 65 percent
said they are influenced by labor's endorsement of political
candidates and 81 percent said they gave money to the USW's
political action committee.
   The 620,000-member union, as part of the AFL-CIO, has endorsed
Democrat Michael Dukakis for president.
   Professor Marick F. Masters of the university's Joseph M. Katz
Graduate School of Business conducted the 112-question survey among
local USW leaders from across the country attending union meetings
last summer and fall. The study for the union was released Thursday.
   Masters noted that about 85 percent of those surveyed were white
males, 75 percent were married, 65 percent were at least 36 years
old, and less than 19 percent had been laid off in the previous
three years.
   Although nearly 55 percent reported earning at least $25,000, 74
percent of those who donated money to the union's political action
committee gave $29 or less, and 27.5 percent gave less than $10,
according to the study.

   Economic experts met Thursday to
discuss the ability of the United States to compete in the world
marketplace, but there was wide disagreement over whether the
nation is falling behind its industrial competitors in Asia and
Europe.
   The huge U.S. budget and foreign trade deficits were major
issues in the debate.
   As the elections approach, a major question is ``the impact of
American consumers buying more and more foreign-made products on
our ability to deal with national priorities,'' said Harold J.
Raveche, president of Stevens Institute of Technology, which played
host to the meeting.
   ``Let us also ask the difficult question: How can a debtor
nation continue to lead?'' Raveche said.
   Economist George Gilder, author of ``Wealth and Poverty'' and
``The Spirit of Enterprise,'' countered that the supposed decline
in U.S. competitiveness is in fact a myth.
   ``The key lesson of the past eight years is an overwhelming
increase in U.S. competitiveness that has attracted capital from
all over the world,'' he said.
   Gilder argued that the enormous U.S. foreign trade deficits in
recent years largely reflect the inflow of investment capital, and
``are a sign of strength, not of weakness.''
   ``It is ludicrous to worry about a foreign takeover of the
United States economy when the United States still has 45 percent
of the world's foreign direct investment and when only five percent
of American industrial assets are owned by foreigners compared to
20 percent in Europe,'' he said.
   David Halberstam, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, stressed the
importance of education in world competitiveness, noting that
``technical universities like Stevens are the cutting edge of
economic development.''
   Peter Sprague, chairman of the board of National Semiconductor
Corp., noted that ``the American university system is a Mecca for
foreign students.''
   ``About half our science and engineering students are
foreigners,'' he said. ``We should accept them as immigrants.''
   However, Halberstam argued that American primary and secondary
education is inferior to the Japanese system.
   ``Higher education in the United States will not be good enough
if our elementary and high school education don't work,'' he said.
``The Japanese are killing us in ninth grade mathematics.''
   Kenneth Wilson, the 1982 winner of the Nobel prize in physics,
urged the importance of government financing for scientific
research. He asserted that ``scientific progress in the United
States for the past 30 years has been practically all financed by
the government.''
   Gilder emphatically held his position that the United States is
surging ahead in competitiveness.
   ``Power has shifted and is shifting toward the United States and
Asia,'' where more capitalist policies are followed, he argued.
``All Europe's growth in the 1980s was due to the growth of
government consumption and created no new jobs at all. Europe is
stagnating.''
   But Clyde Prestowitz Jr., former counselor for Japanese affairs
to the secretary of commerce, took a gloomier view. He recalled
that successive American industries _ steel, automobiles,
electronics, semiconductors _ have failed to hold their own against
Japanese and other competitors.
   Now the Japanese are increasing their foothold in U.S. banking,
he said. The competitiveness problem for the United States, he
said, is not only industrial but also financial.

   Assets of the nation's 451 money market mutual
funds rose $305.4 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $267.46 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $182 million increase in the funds' assets
the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 223 general purpose funds fell $80.8 million to $85.04
billion, assets of 103 broker-dealer funds increased $876.5 million
to $113.35 billion, and assets of 125 institutional funds declined
$490.3 million to $69.07 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.47 percent from 7.48 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose, to 7.45 percent from 7.43
percent, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
unchanged at 35 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.05 percent as of Wednesday from 6.03 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.11 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.77
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.76 the
previous week. Yields were 8.08 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
8.09 percent; 8.31 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.33 percent;
and 8.58 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.59 percent.

<HEAD>Gold Prices Rebound But Experts Still Expect Sharp Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metals futures prices rebounded Wednesday in response
to weaker bond prices and a softer dollar but analysts continued to
predict that gold would soon return to its recent lows below $400 a
troy ounce.
   On other markets, energy futures rallied sharply; livestock and
meat gained; grains and soybeans were mixed; and stock-index
futures retreated.
   Gold for October delivery traded as high as $409 a troy ounce on
New York's Commodity Exchange and December gold hit $416 as traders
interpreted lower bond prices and the weaker dollar as bullish
signals for the precious metals.
   But to chart-watching technical traders, those gold prices _ the
highest in three weeks _ meant the market was overbought. The
technicians sold, driving the December contract down to a close of
$412.20, although the spot contract held up well, settling at
$408.40.
   Analyst Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Co. in New York, said the
bond and dollar weakness that precipitated Wednesday's gold rush
was largely based on expectations that the government would report
a widening of the U.S. trade deficit in a report due out Thursday
morning.
   Meanwhile, he said, the low inflation rate, ample gold supplies
and other factors that led to the gold market's collapse last month
remain in place.
   ``I think the market is in an overbought condition and I think
we'll test the recent lows of $390 to $395'' in the December
contract, Cardillo said.
   Gold settled $3.80 to $4.70 higher with the contract for
delivery in December at $412.20 a troy ounce; silver was 11.9 cents
to 12 cents higher with December at $6.395 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices galloped higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, paced by unleaded gasoline, which surged the
2-cents-a-gallon daily limit before late profit-taking reduced the
gains.
   Crude oil settled above $14 a barrel for the first time in two
weeks.
   The rally reflected ``a general mood of reassessment'' about the
ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
curb their crude oil production and boost prices, said Peter
Beutel, an analyst in New York with Elders Futures Inc.
   Cardillo said the oil rally was linked to growing signs that the
cease-fire between Iran and Iraq would develop into a lasting peace.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 33 cents to 56 cents
higher with November at $14.11 a barrel; heating oil was 1.01 cents
to 1.76 cents higher with November at 40.84 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 1.40 cents to 1.95 cents higher with November
at 42.66 cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures posted strong gains due to higher cash markets
and indications of firmer demand for beef at the wholesale and
retail levels, analysts said. Pork futures gained on spillover
buying from the cattle pits.
   Live cattle settled .25 cent to 1.02 cents higher with October
at 72.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .73 cent
higher with October at 81.75 cents a pound; hogs were .22 cent
lower to .30 cent higher with October at 40.30 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .17 cent higher with February
at 48.05 cents a pound.
   Grain futures finished mostly higher while soybeans ended mostly
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade in light, cautious trading
ahead of the Agriculture Department's revised crop production
report.
   The report, issued shortly after the close, pegged soybean
production at 1.5 billion bushels and corn production at 4.55
billion bushels.
   Both of those estimates were higher than the USDA's September
projections, reflecting better-than-expected yields from the
ongoing harvest.
   The numbers indicated that drought damage would result in a 35
percent reduction in the corn crop from last year's 7.1 billion
bushels and a 21 percent drop in soybean production from last
year's 1.9 billion bushels.
   Analysts and traders said the report was slightly bearish for
grain and soybean prices but they did not expect a major sell-off.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if it ticks down and goes right back
up,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co.
   Wheat settled \ cent lower to 2 cents higher with December at
$4.34} a bushel; corn was { cent lower to 1{ cents higher with
December at $2.96\ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher
with December at $2.56} a bushel; soybeans were 3\ cents lower to 1
cent higher with November at $7.90\ a bushel.
   Stock-index futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of stocks on the
Standard & Poor's 500 index settled 3.94 points lower at 273.99.

   Chemical Banking Corp., the nation's fifth-largest banking
company, said Thursday that it had a third-quarter profit after
losing money a year ago while sixth-ranked Security Pacific Corp.
reported record earnings during the summer period.
   Meanwhile, Continental Illinois Corp., another large banking
concern, said its third-quarter profit rose 22 percent and Bank of
New York Co. posted a 20 percent gain over a year ago.
   Chemical said that for the three months ended Sept. 30 it netted
$211.9 million, or $3.43 a share, compared with a loss of $66.4
million in 1987.
   For the first nine months, it earned $465.1 million, or $7.36 a
share, compared with a $1.08 billion net loss last year, when the
company increased its loan-loss provision to cover possible losses
from Third World loans.
   Security Pacific earned a record $167.9 million, or $1.47 a
share, in the third quarter. That was 30 percent higher than the
$128.8 million, or $1.16 a share, it earned last year.
   In the first three quarters the Los Angeles company earned
$469.4 million, or $4.13 a share, vs. $55.1 million, or 41 cents a
share in the same year-ago period.
   Continental Illinois said it earned $73.6 million, or 30 cents a
share, in the third quarter, compared with net income of $60.1
million, or 24 cents a share, in the same period last year.
   For the first nine months, it earned a record $202.3 million, or
81 cents a share, vs. a $373.7 million loss last year, when it
increased its Third World loan-loss provision.
   Bank of New York said it earned $54.2 million, or $1.39 per
share on a fully diluted basis, for the three months ended Sept.
30, compared with $45.2 million, or $1.22 a share, in the same
period last year.
   For the first nine months it netted $158.3 million, or $4.16 a
share, compared with $57.6 million, or $1.22 a share, in 1987.
   Chemical's quarterly results were bolstered by several
nonrecurring gains, including $40.4 million from the settlement of
a portion of Chemical's pension obligations and $23.3 million from
the sale of certain nonstrategic businesses. Excluding those
special items, third-quarter earnings would have been $148.2
million.
   Chemical said it also benefitted from increases in corporate
finance fees, bond trading and foreign exchange trading profits and
a lower provision for loan losses.
   Texas Commerce Bancshares, which was acquired by Chemical in May
1987, posted a third-quarter profit of $6.8 million, compared with
a $13.5 million loss last year.
   Security Pacific said its third-quarter results were helped by
higher net interest margins, little change in non-interest expenses
and a $32 million gain from the sale of some of its Hong Kong
banking operations.
   ``Our expense cotrol programs are increasing our profitability
and strengthening the corporation across the board,'' Security
Pacific Chairman Richard J. Flamson III said.
   Continental Illinois said its third-quarter results included
$28.7 million in net gains from the sales of certain domestic and
foreign operations, although those gains were partly offset by a
$15 million reduction in interest revenue from foreign loans.
   At the Bank of New York, Chairman J. Carter Bacot attributed the
increase in third-quarter earnings to strong growth in lending
activities and tighter control of operating expenses.
   Bank of New York is in the process of merging with rival Irving
Bank Corp. in a deal valued at $1.4 billion. The agreement, which
came earlier this month, ended one of the nation's longest and most
bitter hostile takeovers.
   The merger will make Bank of New York one of the largest banking
companies in the countries.

   The stock market weathered the news of a
wider-than-expected U.S. trade deficit in August to post some
scattered gains Thursday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.12 to 2,133.36.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
751 up, 669 down and 535 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 154.53 million
shares, against 154.84 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 177.78 million shares.
   Before the market opened the Commerce Department reported that
the trade deficit expanded to $12.18 billion in August from $9.47
billion the month before.
   The latest figure slightly exceeded advance estimates on Wall

But the dollar soon steadied.
   Analysts said the stock market appeared to have taken the news

Jones industrial average fell 30.23 points.
   Thursday's activity came as a sharp contrast to the occasion of
the August trade report a year ago, when an unpleasanbt surprise in
the data touched off a 95-point drop in the Dow just a few days
before Black Monday on Oct. 19.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose 1[ to 118|; Sears Roebuck gained 2[ to 42], and
American Telephone & Telegraph was down \ at 26\.
   Federal National Mortgage climbed 1| to 50}, trading at new
52-week highs. On Wednesday the company reported sharply higher
earnings for the third quarter.
   Avon Products dropped 1\ to 24]. The company said it would post
losses for the third quarter and the year as a result of a $425

   Genentech dropped 1 to 16}. The company said it had finished
production for this year of a drug used to treat blood clots
associated with heart attacks.
   Sales of the new drug have so far fallen short of lofty
expectations on Wall Street.

stocks as West Point Pepperell, up 3| at 40|; Chicago Pacific, up

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .57 to 155.34.

<HEAD>Aerospace Company's Profit Up 15 Pct. in 3rd Qtr.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALABASAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp. said Thursday its
operating profit rose 15 percent in the third quarter while net
income, boosted by the sale of a computer operation, tripled in the
period.
   The aerospace company said earnings from continuing operations
totaled $123 million, or $2.07 a share, up from $107 million, or
$1.61 a share, in the third quarter of 1987.
   Earnings from continuing operations improved primarily because
the new federal income tax law and accounting changes have cut the
company's tax bill, said Lawrence O. Kitchen, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Lockheed said income of $177 million from discontinued
operations boosted final net to $300 million, or $5.06 a share,
from $101 million, or $1.52 a share a year earlier.
   The third-quarter results were helped by Lockheed's sale of its
Dialog Information Services for $202 million. Partly offsetting
that one-time gain was a $26 million loss on the closing of
Lockheed Shipbuilding Co. in Seattle.
   Sales for the quarter were $2.4 billion, down from $2.7 billion
a year earlier. The company attributed the decline to the winding
down of the C-5B military transport plane production project.
   For the first nine months of the year, Lockheed earned $338
million, or $5.60 a share on continuing operations, up from $294
million, or $4.44 a share, a year earlier. Net earnings for the
nine months were $520 million, or $8.61 a share, up from $287
million, or $4.33 a share a year earlier.
   Sales in the first nine months totaled $7.6 billion, down from
$8 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Orange Juice Futures Soar On Rumors Of Brazilian Delivery Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Orange juice futures prices leaped dramatically Thursday on the
New York Cotton Exchange on rumors that Brazil, the world's largest
orange juice producer, may have problems meeting its delivery
commitments, analysts said.
   But Brazilian officials said such fears were unfounded.
   On other exchanges, cotton futures soared; soybeans moved
sharply higher, pulling grain futures along; livestock and meat
futures were mostly higher; energy futures rose; precious metals
retreated; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures began the session on a
low note due to a greater-than-expected Florida production estimate
in the Agriculture Department's first forecast of the season and
beneficial overnight rains in Brazil.
   But rumors surfaced at mid-morning that, for unknown reasons,
Brazil might have trouble meeting its delivery commitments and a
buying binge commenced.
   ``The market shot up extremely strongly,'' said Judith Ganes, an
analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The contract for November delivery of frozen concentrated orange
juice skyrocketed to its permitted limit of 10 cents a pound, which
forced a 30-minute trading halt in accordance with the exchange's
rules, she said.
   Florida commercial players turned sellers when trading resumed,
analysts said. The November price dropped sharply but climbed back
later in the session to finish at $1.8865 a pound, 7.75 cents above
Wednesday's settlement price.
   Ms. Ganes said she had learned that a fire at the Bank of Brazil
in Rio de Janeiro may have destroyed some documents pertaining to
the orange juice business.
   ``However, I feel that in no way should that affect Brazil's
ability to deliver orange juice,'' she said.
   Brazilian citrus traders and government officials reportedly
said shipments of frozen concentrated orange juice were moving
normally. A fire destroyed the import-export branch of the Bank of
Brazil in Rio but that did not affect the issuing of licenses,
according to bank officials.
   Cotton for delivery in December and March soared the
2-cents-a-pound limit on technical factors and on talk of Chinese
buying, said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist with Prudential-Bache
Securities in New York.
   December cotton settled at 55.75 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures surged on the Chicago Board of Trade on rumors
that the Soviet Union might have bought 200,000 metric tons of U.S.
soybean meal, analysts said.
   Soybean meal for near-month delivery surged more than $7 a ton
while most soybean contracts gained more than 20 cents a bushel,
pushing the price for November delivery well above $8. Most of the
buying came late in the session after talk of the possible Soviet
purchase surfaced.
   Grain futures closed mostly higher on spillover buying from the
soybean complex, he said.
   Wheat settled 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at
$4.35\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2{ cents higher with December
at $2.97\ a bushel; oats were 3{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with
December at $2.57{ a bushel; soybeans were 9 cents to 22 cents
higher with November at $8.12 a bushel.
   Frozen pork belly futures finished sharply higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange as traders bought contracts in reaction to an
exchange report showing some movement of bellies out of storage
last week, analysts said.
   The market had been expecting more bellies to be placed in cold
storage, said Philip Stanley, an analyst in Chicago with Thomson
McKinnon Securities Inc.
   Higher cash prices also boosted the pork complex while the
cattle market finished mixed in directionless trading.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent lower to .57 cent higher with
October at 73.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .25
cent higher with October at 81.97 cents a pound; hogs were .22 cent
to .58 cent higher with October at 40.57 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.33 cents to 1.40 cents higher with February at 49.40
cents a pound.
   Unleaded gasoline led energy futures higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange due to concern about tightening gasoline
supplies.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled unchanged to 10 cents
higher with November at $14.21 a barrel; heating oil was .08 cent
lower to .91 cent higher with November at 41.75 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .40 cent to 1.49 cents higher with November
at 44.15 cents a gallon.
   Precious metals futures declined modestly on the Commodity
Exchange in New York in light trading.
   Gold settled $1.50 to $1.80 lower with December at $410.40 a
troy ounce; silver was 1.7 cents to 2 cents lower with December at
$6.375 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of stocks on the
Standard & Poor's 500 index settled .80 point higher at 277.

   Automakers reported Thursday their sales of
U.S.-made cars and trucks jumped 31.5 percent in early October from
a year earlier, but that was a time when buying had slowed after a
race for big incentives ended.
   Companies making cars and light trucks in the United States said
they sold 278,932 vehicles during the Oct. 1-10 period this year,
which was the first period in the 1989 model year. They sold
238,707 during the same time last year.
   The percentage comparison is based on daily sales rates because
the period is so short. There were eight selling days in the period
this year, compared with nine last year.
   At the end of September last year, when the 1987 model year came
to a close, many popular, cut-rate financing and cash-back
incentives expired. Those offers drew in a lot of consumers and
buying dropped after new models went on sale.
   ``You were heading into the nothingness stage last year, where
all the programs were expiring and inventories were getting down to
a very low level,'' said analyst Charles Brady at the investment
firm Oppenheimer & Co. in New York.
   ``Now all of a sudden, their comparison looks phenomenal,''
Brady said.
   Sales of U.S.-made cars rose 36.8 percent in early October
compared to the same period last year, rising to a total of 183,652
cars from 151,043.
   Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
agreed that some car buyers who were planning on purchasing cars in
late autumn last year headed to showrooms in September 1987 to take
advantage of incentives for '86 models.
   ``Probably the whole month of October is going to be very high
because the basis of last year was very low,'' she said.
   Heaney also said U.S. automakers put incentives on their 1989
models shortly after they were introduced and that accounted for
some of the sales boost early this month.
   ``This year there was nothing really new (on showroom floors),''
she said. ``I guess that was part of the reason for them putting
the incentives on this year.''
   For the calendar year, domestic automakers have sold 5,927,753
cars, compared with 5,666,841 last year _ a 4.6 percent increase.
   For early October, Ford Motor Co. showed the largest increase,
with car sales jumping 70 percent on a daily basis to a total of
58,407 from 38,662 last year. Light truck sales increased 23.1
percent, to 33,574 from 30,681.
   General Motors Corp. showed a 31.7 percent rise in car sales, to
90,183 from 77,032. GM's light truck sales rose 29.3 percent, to
41,010 from 35,693.
   Chrysler Corp.'s U.S.-made car sales rose 11.8 percent, to
24,566 from 24,714. Its light trucks sales dropped 10.4 percent,
falling to 19,297 from 19,667.

<HEAD>Magazine Reports Possible Scandal Involving Pershing Securities
Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.'s
Pershing Division is under investigation for possible misuse of
customer shares that may have earned it $1 million a year in
profits, Business Week reported Thursday.
   In an article in its Oct. 24 edition titled ``Is a New Scandal
Building on Wall Street?'', the magazine said the Securities and
Exchange Commission and New York Stock Exchange were investigating
allegations by former Pershing employees that the firm had taken
advantage of access to customer securities to improperly trade them.
   The magazine said one ex-employee, Thomas Cusati, professed to
have direct knowledge of abuse of customer securities since 1985.
It said he was fired after disputes with his superiors.
   ``His charges raise the prospect of still another firm being
accused of officially sanctioned misconduct, three years after the
Street was rocked by E.F. Hutton & Co.'s guilty plea to charges
arising from a check-kiting scandal,'' the magazine said.
   SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue said she had no comment on the
Business Week story. The enforcement agency does not comment on
investigations. New York Stock Exchange spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin
also declined to comment.
   Business Week quoted Cusati as saying he had brought the
improper trading to the attention of his boss and the Equitable
Life Assurance Society, the parent of Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette,
last June.
   The magazine quoted officials of Donaldson and Equitable as
saying internal investigations were under way into Cusati's
assertions.
   Catherine Conroy, a Donaldson spokeswoman, did not immediately
return telephone calls for comment on the story. Equitable
spokeswoman Nacy Green was said by a receptionist to be out of the
office.
   Founded a half-century ago by the son of John Pershing, the
World War I general, Pershing is the largest correspondent clearing
firm, which handles trades and oversees customer accounts for
dozens of smaller brokerages nationwide.

<HEAD>On Saturday, Add Those Extra Digits Or Else</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Starting Saturday, your fingers will have to do an
extra three digits of walking when calling about half of
Massachusetts.
   If they don't, this is the computerized voice you'll hear:
   ``The area code for the number you dialed has been changed to
508. Please hang up and dial the area code 508 for the number you
are calling.''
   Make that 1-508.
   The long-planned addition of a new area code for about 190
communities in eastern and central Massachusetts was undertaken by
New England Telephone Co. to avoid the inevitability of running out
of new telephone numbers.
   The 508 service was activated in July, but using the new code
was voluntary. As of Saturday, callers will hear the recording
unless they dial the extra digits.
   Three towns _ Walpole, Dover and North Reading _ all appealed
their placement in 508 to the state Department of Public Utilities.
They all lost. Wilmington put its appeal on hold but said it would
not pursue it after the others failed.
   ``We feel it's a great inconvenience,'' Wilmington Town Manager
Buzz Stapczynski said Wednesday. ``Most of our business is
conducted with Boston _ 99.9 percent of the calls I make are to
Boston.''
   Bitterness and embarrassment over being removed from Boston's
617 area code _ along with new letterhead, business cards and truck
lettering _ are some of the aftereffects of the new code.
   ``We in fact are part of Greater Boston,'' asserted Hartnell
Bartlett, selectmen chairman in North Reading, which spent $20,000
to fight the change. ``Everything we do is within that region.
We're the only community with a 508 exchange listed in the Greater
Boston telephone directory.''
   More than the inconvenience of dialing the extra digits,
officials in border towns complained they were being exiled to
exurbia by virtue of the less serious area code.
   ``It obviously has a significant cost on businesses and a
psychological impact,'' Bartlett said. ```Gee, North Reading must
be up there someplace. It's in another area code.'''
   Stapczynski said Wilmington is part of the Boston-based
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority and the Massachusetts Planning Commission.
   ``We don't relate to Lowell or Haverhill or Lawrence or any of
those places,'' he said.
   But Stapczynski said the town decided against fighting the new
code because of the expense and almost-sure defeat. ``Why fight the
bureaucracy and spend a ton of money and come out with the same
decision?'' he said.
   New England Telephone Co. spokesman Peter Cronin said the
company sought to maintain a near equal number of telephone lines
in the two regions, minimize confusion and consider business and
residential trends when deciding what towns were moved to 508.
   ``The line had to go someplace and we felt we had established
very fair criteria and very faithfully followed those criteria,''
he said.
   Callers will not have to pay more money when calling into the
new area code, Cronin said.

   James L. Broadhead, the president of GTE Corp.'s
Telephone Operating Group, is resigning at age 52 to pursue other
interests, GTE said Thursday.
   Broadhead's resignation is unrelated to the ongoing
reorganization at GTE that includes the creation of a new
headquarters for the company's local exchange carrier operations,
the company said. Broadhead would not have been involved in the
move to the new headquarters in any case.
   ``This resignation had nothing to do with differences of opinion
over strategy,'' said Harvey Greisman, a spokesman at GTE's
headquarters in Stamford, Conn.
   Some of Broadhead's responsibilities will be taken over until a
successor is named by Kent Foster, group vice president of
telephone operations.
   The Telephone Operating Group accounted for $11.8 billion of
GTE's $15.4 billion in sales last year.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls on Report of Wider Trade Deficit</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS grafs 5-6 to CORRECT Dow close and update bond yields;
picks up 7th graf pvs, The dollar ....</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell Thursday but other markets
reacted calmly to a report that the nation's persistent trade
deficit widened in August.
   One year ago, an unexpected rise in the trade deficit served as
one of the catalysts for the stock market crash.
   The Commerce Department reported that the merchandise trade
deficit widened to $12.2 billion in August from $9.5 billion in
July, confirming fears that had pushed stocks, bonds and the dollar
down earlier in the week.
   The news pushed the dollar still lower. But the stock and bond
markets took the news in stride.
   More stocks rose than fell on Wall Street as the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrial stocks rose 7.12 points to 2,133.36. The
average had fallen 30.23 points on Wednesday.
   In the bond market, interest rates rose immediately after the
report, but then partly retreated. One closely watched measure of
rates, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, rose to 8.92 percent
from 8.90 percent late Wednesday.
   The dollar was ready to be nudged down further because the mood
of the market had seemingly shifted against it this week.
   ``The market's still not totally sure about it ... (but) the
first reaction is, we've got to sell the dollar,'' said Rimmer de
Vries, chief economist of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.
   By late in the day, the dollar was down to less than 127.5
Japanese yen and 1.82 West German marks, compared to more than 129
yen and 1.83 marks on Wednesday.
   Hopes for big reductions in the trade deficit had helped push
the dollar higher through June, July and August. The dollar peaked
around Sept. 1, then drifted slowly downward before falling steeply
this week toward its level of early summer.
   Sentiments about the dollar are subject to change without
notice, and some analysts said Thursday that they believed the
underlying trend in the dollar was still for a stable or higher
currency.
   ``This is not a sufficiently bad number to change the
psychology,'' said Lawrence Krohn, senior economist for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Dollar traders and speculators have plenty of room to interpret
the latest trade figures because economists have sharply
conflicting projections for how much the trade deficit will shrink
in coming years.
   Economists are divided between ``long laggers,'' who expect the
deficit to keep dropping sharply because of the lagging reaction to
the dollar's decline since 1985, and ``short laggers,'' who believe
all the benefits from the dollar drop have already come.
   De Vries, who called himself a ``short lagger'' Thursday, said
the dollar's decline is good because it will make U.S. goods more
competitive in world markets and help shrink the trade deficit.
   ``I'm glad about it. We ought to make a lot more headway on the
trade balance,'' de Vries said.
   The all-time high in imports in August outweighed exports, which
also set a monthly record. The heavy imports indicated that
Americans have not lost their taste for imported goods in spite of
a rise in their prices from the depreciated dollar.
   The imbalance between what the United States imports and what it
sells abroad was up by $2.7 billion over a July deficit of $9.5
billion, which had had been the smallest monthly imbalance in more
than three years.
   From the point of view of inflation-wary investors, the
combination of strong exports and strong imports was ``probably the
worst combination you could get'' because it signals possible
overheating of the economy, said Michael Moran, chief economist of
Daiwa Securities America Inc.

<HEAD>Minorco Rejects Claim of South African Domination Of Gold Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment company making a hostile bid for
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC on Thursday disputed Consolidated's
claim that the takeover would lead to South African domination of
world gold and strategic metals markets.
   Minorco S.A., a Luxembourg-based firm controlled by Anglo
American Corp. of South Africa and DeBeers Consolidated Mines Ltd.,
made the arguments Thursday in an additional filing with the
British government's Office of Fair Trading.
   Anglo American and DeBeers are the gold and diamond mining
interests of South Africa's Oppenheimer family.
   The fair trading office has the power to recommend an
investigation of the bid on competition or public-interest grounds.
   ``The suggestion that Anglo American, Gold Fields and Minorco
together could influence the world price and free availability of
gold is not supported by the facts,'' Minorco contended in its
filing.
   Minorco, meanwhile, disclosed that it had purchased more of
London-based Consolidated Gold Fields' shares on the London Stock
Exchange to lift its holding to 62.6 million shares, or 29.32
percent.
   Minorco's cash-and-share bid values Consolidated Gold Fields'
entire share capital at about 2.9 billion pounds, or $5 billion.
   Consolidated Gold Fields told the office Oct. 6 that success of
the Minorco bid would give the Anglo American group control of 35
percent of the Western world's gold supplies, compared with the
group's current 20 percent share.
   But Minorco said Thursday that calculation wrongly included
Consolidated Gold Fields' interests in companies in which it has a
minority stake, including Newmont Mining Corp. of the United
States, Renison Gold Fields of Australia, and Gold Fields of South
Africa Ltd.
   Minorco said it would sell Consolidated Gold Fields' holdings of
49.3 percent in Newmont and 38 percent in Gold Fields of South
Africa if the bid succeeds. It would keep the 49 percent share of
Renison.
   The sell-off would leave Minorco with an attributable interest
of 1 percent of the West's gold production, coupled with the 20
percent share held by Anglo American.
   Minorco also rejected the claim that the bid would lead to South
African domination of certain strategic minerals and metals,
particularly the mineral sands from which zircon and titanium are
extracted.
   Consolidated Gold Fields' shares closed 6 pence (10.48 cents)
lower at 12.45 pounds ($21.75) Thursday on the London Stock
Exchange. Minorco's offer is currently worth 12.66 pounds ($22.12
dollars) per share.

<TEXT>
   Gannett Co.'s profit rose 6.5 percent in the
third quarter as higher broadcasting and billboard revenues
outpaced gains in the sale of newspaper ads, the media company said
Thursday.
   Net income totaled $75.1 million, or 47 cents a share in the
quarter ended Sept. 25, up from $70.5 million, or 44 cents a share
a year ago.
   Revenue rose 7 percent to $804.3 million, from $751.1 million in
the third quarter of 1987.
   John J. Curley, president and chief executive of the media
conglomerate, called the company's performance satisfactory
``despite a soft economic environment.''
   Gannett said total newspaper advertising revenue rose 5 percent
to $455.6 million, from $431.7 million in 1987's third quarter.
Earnings in the newspaper group were up slightly, while advertising
linage increased 1 percent.
   Advertising revenue at USA Today, the flagship of the company's
89 daily newspapers, rose 17 percent partly because of rate
adjustments, even though total ads decreased to 867 pages from 871
pages.
   Broadcasting revenues increased 10 percent in the quarter, to
$89.7 million, while outdoor advertising increased 21 percent, to
$65.2 million.
   For the first nine months, Gannett said net income increased 16
percent to $246.6 million, or $1.52 a share, compared with $212.8
million, or $1.32 a share in the year-ago period.
   Revenue rose 7 percent to $2.41 billion, from $2.24 billion a
year ago. Results for the nine months included a non-recurring gain
on the sale of the company's investment in Cowles Media, the
company said.
   In addition to the daily newspapers, Gannett publishes 35
non-daily newspapers and a newspaper magazine. The company also
operates 10 television stations, 16 radio stations, Gannett News
Service and the largest outdoor advertising company in North
America.

<TEXT>
   Venezuela's Energy and Mines minister,
Julio Cesar Gil, said Thursday his country would back a special
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
discuss low oil prices.
   According to the state run news agency Venpress, Gil said such a
meeting, called for by Libya, would be backed by Venezuela ``as
long as there is sufficient preliminary preparation ... that
results or accords reached can be carried out by all the members.''
   ``The government of Libya has called for the meeting and at this
moment the secretary general of OPEC is carrying out the necessary
consultations with the member nations to determine the feasibility
of such a meeting,'' said Gil.
   OPEC's long range strategy committee will meet Oct. 20 in Madrid
in conjunction with the organization's pricing committee to revise
production and pricing strategy, OPEC announced this week.
   The extraordinary OPEC conference would probably be held
sometime before the ordinary meeting of all member nations
scheduled for late November.
   When asked what the purpose of such an extraordinary meeting
would be, Gil replied ``there's only one point, and that's to
examine the price situation.''

<HEAD>Goodrich's Profit Up 43 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BF Goodrich Co. on Thursday reported a 43
percent jump in its third-quarter profit from a year earlier,
boosted by strong performances in its core chemical and aerospace
businesses.
   The plastics, chemicals and aerospace company said its net
income in the quarter ended Sept. 30 rose to $60.8 million, or
$2.32 a share, from $42.4 million, or $1.71 a share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue increased to $640.4 million from $527.4
million.
   ``Not only are current earnings meeting our expectations, but
developments necessary for long-term profitability are
progressing,'' said Chairman John D. Ong.
   Last month, the company adopted a plan aimed at protecting
employees in the event of a hostile takeover. The plan covers 4,000
salaried workers at the company.
   Rumors in September linked heavy activity in Goodrich stock with
Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith and British conglomerate
Hanson Trust PLC. Goldsmith, who is known to own an undisclosed
amount of Goodrich shares, dispelled the rumors by saying he is
supportive of Goodrich management.
   In the first nine months of the year, Goodrich earned $158.5
million, or $6.02 a share, up sharply from $84.5 million, or $3.33
a share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue rose to $1.8 billion from $1.5 million.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply showed mixed results in early October, the Federal Reserve
Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,029.2 billion in the week ended Oct. 3 from $3,033.4
billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$3,857.7 billion from $3,852.0 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $782.2 billion from $784.2 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   The Fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for
annual growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent,
which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5
percent. The Fed has not set a specific target range for M1 since
early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $504 million in
the week ended Oct. 5, compared with a decline of $81 million a
week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $446 million a day
in the week ended Wednesday, down from $914 billion in the previous
week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $282.1 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $283.4 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Negotiators Agree On Iraq Sanctions, Virginia Battlefield</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Top 6 grafs new with more agreements; pickup 4th graf pvs,
bgng: ``Tax-writers hope...''</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior tax negotiators from the House and
Senate reached agreement Thursday on legislation imposing limited
economic sanctions against Iraq and seizing a portion of a historic
battlefield in northern Virginia, aides said.
   Working on a miscellaneous tax bill, negotiators also approved a
tax break for free-lance writers, photographers and artists and an
increased mileage deduction for rural mail carriers who use their
own cars on their routes.
   Free-lancers would be permitted to deduct expenses of a project
in the year they are incurred, rather than wait until a book,
painting or other work starts producing income. The provision
overturns a change brought about by the 1986 tax overhaul.
   Under the agreement, rural letter carriers would be permitted to
deduct 33.75 cents per mile, 50 percent more than the usual rate
allowed for business mileage.
   Also approved by senior negotiators was agreement to eliminate
restrictions on the amount of long-term bonds the Treasury
Department may issue at rates above 4.25 percent.
   Aides said the two senior Democrats and two senior Republicans
from each house agreed on these provisions, which still are subject
to endorsement by other negotiators.
   Tax-writers hope to complete the compromise tax bill in time for
the House and Senate to give it final approval next week before
adjourning for the year.
   On a 50-25 vote last week, the Senate ordered the seizure of 540
acres of land in Prince William County, Va., to block construction
of a shopping mall on the site where Gen. Robert E. Lee had his
headquarters during the Second Battle of Manassas in August 1862.
   The Reagan administration opposes the seizure as too expensive,
favoring the taking of only about 80 acres. Interior Secretary
Donald P. Hodel has said he will recommend that President Reagan
veto legislation to which the Manassas amendment is attached.
   The sanctions against Iraq were approved by the Senate last week
on an 87-0 vote, the third time senators have thus registered their
displeasure with Iraq's use of poison gas against its Kurdish
minorities. However, the sanctions exempt U.S. farmers and
manufacturers of farm equipment by allowing continued exports of
farm products.
   The bill would immediately bar exportation of high-technology
equipment and munitions and require that U.S. representatives in
international organizations oppose loans to Iraq.
   The president would be required to impose additional sanctions
by yearend if Iraq continues to use chemical weapons. Those
sanctions could include a cutoff of export-import credit,
restricting imports from Iraq and downgrading U.S. relations with
Iraq.
   Final provisions of the tax bill are being hammered out behind
closed doors by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee; Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman
of the Senate Finance subcommittee on revenue measures, and senior
Republicans on the two committees, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas and
Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon.
   The bill is designed chiefly to correct errors in the 1986 tax
overhaul law. It contains dozens of relatively minor targeted tax
cuts and tax increases. The Senate version also would create a
``bill of rights'' for taxpayers involved in disputes with the
Internal Revenue Service.

<HEAD>Average 1987 Income Reported Higher in Japan than in US</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average Japanese earned the equivalent of
$23,022 last year, well above the U.S. average of $18,163 and the
highest income among major industrialized nations surveyed in a
study released Thursday.
   The U.S. average also was topped by the West Germans, whose
income averaged the equivalent of $21,022.
   When it comes to what the money will buy _ in technical tems,
``purchasing power parity'' _ the average American remained in the
lead with $9,009. The West German income was calculated on this
basis at an average $7,783, the Japanese at $7,302.
   The study, ``Japan in the World Economy,'' surveyed earning
power in six of the major industrial nations. After the top three
nations, France had a per capita income equivalent to $17,657,
Italy $14,903 and the United Kingdom $13,395.
   The authors call purchasing power a better measure of people's
prosperity, since it takes account of the cost of food and housing,
which are especially high in Japan.
   For example, the price of a house or apartment in a middle class
Tokyo district is said to be seven to 10 times the earnings of its
owner. A small apartment an hour and a half from the central part
of the city cost nearly $500,000 at the end of 1987.
   In most European and American cities the cost is only four or
five times earnings, and the living space at least twice as large.
   The two-year study was done by Americans Bela Balassa, a
consultant to the World Bank, and Marcus Noland, a visiting
assistant professor at Saitama University in Japan.

<HEAD>Revco Losses Nearly Doubled In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TWINSBURG, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First quarter losses for Anac Holding
Corp., parent of Revco D.S. Inc., nearly doubled over the same
period last year because of extraordinary costs related to Revco's
Chapter 11 filing, the company reported Thursday.
   Anac posted a $27.9 million net loss, greater than the $14
million loss in the same three-month period last year.
   The quarterly operating profit before depreciation and
amortization was $6.1 million, compared with $31.3 million in the
same period last year, according to Gregory K. Raven, Revco's
executive vice president-finance and chief financial officer.
   Anac had $583.7 million in sales for the quarter compared to
$522.8 million in its first fiscal quarter of 1987.
   Raven blamed the losses on ``extraordinary costs and temporarily
low inventory levels directly related to the company's failure to
make a subordinated debt interest payment on June 15, 1988, and its
voluntary filing for Chapter 11 protection'' from creditors in
bankruptcy court.
   Revco filed for Chapter 11 protection on July 28, about a month
after it failed to make an interest payment on about $700 million
in outstanding high-risk junk bonds used to finance its $1.5
billion leveraged buyout in 1986.
   In a leveraged buyout a company is acquired largely through
borrowed funds repaid from a target company's profits or asset
sales.
   The Twinsburg-based company sought protection from creditors
after talks with bondholders broke down, becoming the largest
company involved in a leveraged buyout to take such action.
   Revco operates nearly 2,000 drugs store in 27 states.

<HEAD>Management Group Makes New Offer to Buy HCA</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An investor group led by Hospital
Corporation of America's senior management has made a new,
sweetened offer to buy the hospital chain for more than $3.6
billion, the company said Thursday.
   The new offer of $51 a share in cash and securities for all of
HCA's 70.6 million outstanding shares comes a week after a special
committee of the company's board of directors rejected the group's
initial, $47 a share cash offer.
   HCA stock closed at $44.50 a share Thursday, unchanged from
Wednesday's close in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   The latest offer would pay $43 cash plus securities the group
valued at $8 for each HCA share, the company said in a news
release. The group has commitments for all the debt and equity
financing needed to complete the buyout, HCA said.
   The offer is valid until 5 p.m. EDT Tuesday and is contingent
upon approval by shareholders and the HCA Board.
   A special committee of independent directors of the board
planned to meet at an unspecified date to consider the proposal.
   The special committee on Oct. 6 rejected a $3.3 billion
leveraged buyout proposal from the group, led by HCA Chairman
Thomas F. Frist, and said it wasn't ``in the best interest of the
HCA shareholders.''
   HCA officials could not be reached for comment on the proposal
late Thursday.
   HCA, which owns or operates nearly 400 hospitals worldwide,
making it one of the world's biggest hospital chains, set up the
special committee to consider buyout offers when the first one was
proposed in mid-September.
   HCA reported in July that its profits for the quarter ending
June 30 increased by 15 percent, partly because of increased
inpatient and outpatient revenue.
   HCA sold 104 of its less profitable hospitals just over a year
ago to a new employee-owned company, HealthTrust Inc.

   Campbell Soup Co. announced Thursday it had
acquired a Belgian seafood processor for an undisclosed amount of
cash.
   Morubel NV, based in Oostende, Belgium, is a privately-held
supplier of frozen prawns to major retail chains and food service
customers in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Great Britain. It
had 1987 sales of $44 million.
   Morubel is a major supplier to Campbell's seafood division,
which processes cold water prawns, squid, lobster tails and breaded
scampi.
   ``It's a continuing part of growth strategy,'' James H. Moran, a
Campbell spokesman, said of the acquisition.
   In the year ending July 30, Campbell has made domestic and
international acquisitions totaling $528 million, Moran said.
   Campbell International President John W. Argabright said the
acquisition ``greatly strengthens the seafood business of our
United Kingdom division, ... and gives us access to the growing
frozen seafood specialty market in Europe.''
   Morubel's two facilities in Oostende employ 174 people.

<HEAD>Central Bank Director Fired as Interest Rates Soar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Sarney on Thursday fired
the Central Bank director responsible for a massive jump in money
market interest rates that caused stock prices to tumble and
sparked a frenzy of rumors in financial markets.
   Sarney fired Juarez Soares after the director boosted the
monthly interest rate on overnight money market investments from 39
percent to 50 percent, causing chaos when markets opened Thursday,
according to Presidential Palace spokesman Carlos de Almeida Santos.
   The rate is adjusted daily.
   Soares told Sarney he had hoped to steer investors away from
non-money assets such as stocks, property and gold and back into
cash, Santos said. Higher interest rates increase the
attractiveness of assets denominated in cruzados, the Brazilian
currency.
   In recent months, investors have opted for non-cruzado assets to
protect themselves from steadily-rising inflation, which is
projected at 26 percent this month. The stock market and the value
of such investments have risen substantially.
   But the market interpreted Soares' move as an indication of a
much higher than expected inflation for this month, creating a wave
of panic and rumors that Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega would
be dismissed, Santos said.
   In Rio de Janeiro, the stock market closed down 3.8 percent.
   ``Technically the measure was right but Soares chose a bad
moment,'' said Geraldo Moura, a spokesman for the finance ministry.
``Inflation is high and there is a generalized instability.''
